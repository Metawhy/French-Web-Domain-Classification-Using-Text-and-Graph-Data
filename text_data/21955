Change the Way You Edit Photos With Loupedeck+

   [unknown-sq.jpg&s=100&r=G]
   by Lee Morris
   December 17, 2018
   32 Comments

   IFRAME: Loupedeck, The Fastest Way To Edit Photos
   Video of Loupedeck, The Fastest Way To Edit Photos

   32 Comments

   I have to admit, when I first saw the Loupedeck on Indiegogo two years
   ago, I wrote it off, but after trying it, I now realize just how
   incredible this piece of hardware can be for photographers.

What Is It?

   The Loupedeck+ is a photo-editing "console" (keyboard with knobs) that
   was created to help you edit photos more quickly. It takes the digital
   sliders in Lightroom and makes them physical buttons and knobs. In
   theory, the Loupedeck+ should have everything you need to cull and edit
   an entire photography job without ever reaching for your keyboard or
   mouse.

Build Quality

   The biggest complaint users had with the original Loupedeck seemed to
   be surrounding the build quality. I never used the original, so I can't
   compare it directly, but the version I have, the Loupedeck+, has been
   significantly improved. Obviously, it's not going to compete with the
   build of other color control panels, but it's literally 1/50th of the
   price. The Loupedeck+ is plastic, but it still felt sturdy, similar to
   any midrange keyboard. Most of the knobs can twist and press in, and
   the keyboard keys have a satisfying feel.

Setup

   Setup could not have been easier. After going to Loupedeck's website,
   downloading the Windows driver, and then plugging it in via USB, the
   Loupedeck+ just worked. I had no connection issues, no glitches, no
   complex customizations. You just turn the knobs on the Loupedeck+, and
   it will change the corresponding settings in Lightroom.

Using It

   One thing that keeps me from enjoying a lot of new tech is the learning
   curve. If I have to spend hours, days, or weeks learning something
   before I can actually start enjoying it, I'm probably just going to
   give up. I fully expected that to the be case with Loupedeck+, but once
   again, I was wrong.

   I rarely use Lightroom, and I personally have a really hard time
   finding certain options and settings scattered throughout the menus.
   The Loupedeck lays everything out right in front of you. Without
   watching a tutorial or reading a manual, I was using more features in
   Lightroom via the Loupedeck+ than I ever had with a mouse and keyboard
   before. Having everything spelled out right in front of you, encourages
   you to play, test, and learn. If you turn a knob and you don't like the
   outcome, you can just press the knob in to reset that option back to
   zero.

   After just a couple of minutes, I no longer needed to even look at the
   develop sliders on the right side of Lightroom, and instead, I focused
   exclusively on the photo I was editing. After about 15 minutes, I had
   already memorized where all of my favorite knobs were.

   Many of the buttons are also totally customizable. If you want access
   to a specific slider, you can put it right where you want it. If you
   have certain photo presets you love, you can always have them one
   button press away.

   There's no doubt that the Loupedeck+ will save you time right out of
   the box, but if you spend a little extra time learning what every
   button does and customizing it for your preferences, you'll be able to
   cut even more time from your edits.

Price

   When the Loupedeck first launched, it was $300. Today, you can buy the
   updated Loupedeck+ for $250. It's certainly not cheap, but it's
   actually cheaper than I expected something this specialized to be. If
   you're the type of photographer who could use this, $250 is an
   extremely small price to pay for the amount of time this thing can save
   you.

Who Is It For?

   If you're a commercial photographer, the Loupedeck+ probably isn't for
   you. You're most likely using Lightroom to quickly cull and then using
   Photoshop to edit very small batches of photos using a mouse or tablet.
   Even though the Loupedeck+ does now work with Photoshop, having another
   item on your desk might actually slow you down. If, however, you are
   shooting and delivering large numbers of photos, the Loupedeck+ is
   definitely for you.

   Loupedeck+ also works with Adobe Premiere, and if you find yourself
   tweaking the color on a bunch of different clips, this could also be a
   big time-saver for video editors as well.

   The biggest group of photographers that could benefit from the
   Loupedeck+ are wedding photographers. I was a wedding photographer for
   12 yearsm and editing was the worst part of the job. The Loupedeck+
   would have not only made the editing process more fun, but it
   would have actually cut my editing time by hours for every single job.
   I also think that the Loupedeck+ would have inspired me to do a better
   job editing. Little details like cropping or adding a vignette were
   just barely annoying enough that I might overlook them unless they were
   totally necessary. With the physical knobs right there, I'm encouraged
   to use more of the editing features in Lightroom, because it's so
   convenient.

   If you're a wedding photographer, you should absolutely buy this today,
   but even if you don't shoot weddings, you still might find tremendous
   value in this product. If you're the type of photographer who is doing
   most of your editing in Lightroom, and you need to burn through
   hundreds or thousands of images as quickly as possible, you're going to
   love Loupedeck+.

   On my Mac I use the alt or ctrl key for adjusting my blacks and whites
   and also for selective sharpening and noise reduction. I see this has a
   alt and a ctrl key on the left, does this work the same by pressing one
   of those buttons and using the dials?
   I hate editing with my macs trackpad and this looks like something I
   would enjoy using.

   The biggest apparent downside for me is that when I look at a photo I
   know it needs around +5 shadows for instance. With a mouse, or with a
   wacom tablet which is what I actually use and is faster than a mouse,
   you can just click the bar at around the +5 position and go from there.
   With this, you have to twist the knob from 0 to 1 to 2 .. until +5.

   2nd article I read about this device that suggests you’re having fun
   editing because of it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t loathe twiddling the
   knobs in LR to tweak and process, but fun? I guess I’ll have go buy one
   to find that bit.
   Or maybe not, I’m still not 100% convinced it’s any quicker than my
   Wacom, programmed Wacom hot keys and keyboard shortcuts.

   switched from Canon to Fuji, setting exposure using a dedicated dial
   for each setting somehow became more fun than what I was accustomed to
   doing.

   There is something to being able to make an adjustment physically
   rather than virtually. Probably not the same thrill for everyone, but
   there is something to it.

   I have a Wacom that I was never able to get comfortable with, but I
   think this device or one of its competitors will be able to speed up my
   editing and make it more fun.

   It just way more natural to use knobs or even real sliders than
   focusing your eyes on your mouse pointer hovering over a virtual
   slider.

   Another alternative which I am very satisfied with is the ShuttlePRO v2
   by Contour design: controller in the left hand and the Wacom pen in the
   right hand.

   pleasing when adjusting a slider.

   I'd need 3 or 4 extra custom knobs that could be used for anything to
   be really useful. For landscapes, I really would need a dehaze knob.
   Vignetting knob would be good as well, and same thing for
   sharpening/denoising.

   There's a pricier option from a company called Palette Gear that lets
   you buy knobs, buttons, and sliders a la carte, assuming one of their
   preconfigured packages doesn't have what you need.

   Hopefully, LoupeDeck will fully support Capture One soon because their
   system is much more affordable than the Palette Gear system.

   Get a MIDI Controller like the Behringer X Touch Mini and you can have
   all this for a fraction of the price. Actually my configuration
   provides vignetting and all controls for sharpening.

   D1 is Dehaze by default and Fn+D1 is Vignette. D2 is Lum Noise and
   Fn+D2 is Details. But yeah, a couple more knobs would be nice.

   I've been playing with it a bit. In some ways it's good and in some
   ways not. I'm thinking I'll keep it but still have a week to decide.
   From a build quality standpoint my primary complaint is the button
   travel is about 5 miles. Much shorter travel and a slight bit more back
   pressure on these would be good. I've still not got use to the color
   wheels but we'll see. Backlit keys would be nice

   It took some fiddling to figure out where to put it on my desk. I
   finally placed it above my trackpad (iMac pro) and tilted up slightly.

   I'm a big fan - I like how you can make simultaneous adjustments - if
   you know where you want to go, it's definitely faster. Been using it
   for a year in both LR & C1.

   You've got several typos in your story (including misspelling the name
   of the product itself). Whether this article is a paid advert or not
   (you did provide a link to the product no less than 6 times, after
   all), it would be fair and balanced to suggest alternatives, such as
   the Behringer X Touch Mini, which is vastly superior to the Loupedeck
   due to its massive banks of button assignments and rotary dials, when
   paired with the freeware Midi2LR app. Also much smaller and because
   everything is laid out close to each other, allows you to navigate
   everything by touch alone, so you never have to take your eyes off the
   screen when editing. And it's small, small enough to sit next to your
   computer without taking up room, can be set up horiz or vert, and can
   be tossed into a laptop pocket easily.Rotaries are much more precise
   than using sliders as well. The X Touch is only $50 on Amazon and
   plenty of youtube videos of how to configure and use it for LR.

   Also Pfixer from Pusher labs is designed for many common midi
   controllers. Excellent software and customer support. $99, but lets you
   bring your own device to the party and switch as needed.

   I got the newer version about a month ago and really like it. Editing
   time came down, which of course is a big plus. My only complaint is
   that I wish the color dials were actually knobs. That's the only thing
   I would change.

   Does it work with Adobe Camera Raw? That's what I use to edit. Flame me
   later for it, but if it works and will cut down on editing time I am
   all for it. Unless other suggestions and options for something similar
   but works as well or better. Thank you!

Photographing Horses From Ten Feet Underground: Fstoppers Interviews Andrius
Burba

   Photographing Horses From Ten Feet Underground: Fstoppers Interviews
   Andrius Burba
   10 Comments

   How far would you go to get the shot? If you're Andrius Burba, the
   answer is "however far it takes." Meet the photographer with
   the vision, ingenuity, and talent that came together to create this
   remarkable project, titled "Under-Horse."

   Andrius Burba has shot animals standing on glass before (dogs, cats,
   and rabbits), but moving up to horses presented an entirely new
   challenge, one he called the most difficult of his career. Horses are
   stunningly beautiful animals, but they take a huge amount of training
   (both human and animal) to work with safely and successfully. So
   numerous were the considerations for this project that it took two
   months of planning before the shoot even began.

   Whereas Burba could photograph other animals from the comfort of a
   studio, he needed to go to the horses to get his shots. This meant
   digging a 10-foot deep trench in the middle of a pasture, building a
   trench box, and placing a glass panel on top of it. Of course, with the
   average horse weighing about 1,100 pounds, he had to use incredibly
   strong glass, which itself was 10 feet by 6 feet and made of three
   panels fused together, with a total weight of 900 pounds. As Burba
   notes:

     Everything was way bigger. The technique was the same, but I needed
     way bigger glass, more crew, a bigger studio, cleaner glass on set,
     and even more light.

   Having never worked with horses before, Burba described it as a
   peculiar feeling having a "600-kilogram horse walking on [my] ceiling."
   Nonetheless, he was never afraid of them, finding them to be beautiful
   and brilliant creatures. In addition, he was not worried about the
   glass breaking, as they chose extra strong glass with several factors
   of safety, and theoretically, had the top panel shattered, the bottom
   two should have held. Nonetheless, having a half-ton horse on top of
   glass took some special considerations. Horses typically wear steel or
   aluminum shoes, which could have easily scratched or broken the glass.
   To get around this, each horse wore special rubber shoes that cost 30
   euros a piece and took about 10 minutes to attach.

   In terms of gear, though he normally shoots with a 5D Mark III, Burba
   decided he wanted some extra resolution, switching to a Nikon D810 with
   a NIKKOR 35mm f/1.4G lens. Lighting the horses properly took four
   Profoto Prohead Plus heads at 4,800 Ws a piece, powered by two
   Profoto generators, all shot into two 8-foot by 12-foot frame scrims,
   with two lights per side and a giant black flag overhead to keep the
   images clean.

   To see the entire setup in action, check out the behind the scenes
   footage below (turn on closed captioning for English subtitles). As you
   can see, it took a combination of good training practices and bribery
   with treats (how I generally work with my horse) to convince the horses
   to stand on the glass and pose, but they actually handled the
   experience quite well, with only a few minor incidents when the horses
   spooked and moved off the glass. Three of the eight horses found the
   experience too foreign and refused to stand, but Burba showed proper
   respect and horsemanship and let them be, working with the remaining
   five instead. In fact, he notes the most difficult part of the
   experience actually had nothing to do with the horses, but was rather
   designing and organizing the entire shoot, especially since there was
   no precedent for such an endeavor and it took a crew of 40 people to
   pull it off (whereas the smaller animal shoots typically only required
   one assistant) — a crew for whom he was immensely grateful:

     I can say without your team, you are nothing. You can't make
     anything big alone. You always need people to support your idea and
     believe in it.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDUZnuGYKoA?feature=oembed

   Burba notes his favorite part was getting such a large crew together to
   all work toward a common goal. In addition, the sheer feeling of lying
   on the ground and watching a horse walk directly above him to pose was
   breathtaking. Once he realized the process was going smoothly and as
   planned, he really began to enjoy the experience for what it was and
   worry less about all the details.

   One of the major challenges as compared to photographing smaller
   animals in studio was keeping the glass clean, which Burba said was not
   as easy as he thought it would be. Because the studio was built in the
   middle of a pasture and particularly because it rained, the horses
   brought a lot of mud onto the glass, despite the crew's best efforts to
   clean them beforehand. Altogether, the glass presented the biggest
   photographic challenge: it required constant cleaning (even when the
   horses were on it, requiring good crew coordination), picked up a lot
   of stray reflections (requiring him to wear all black and line the pit
   with black), and frequently fogged and iced over due to temperature
   differentials, forcing the crew to create a makeshift ventilation
   system.

   In addition, working with horses takes a lot of patience and a keen
   understanding of the equine mentality, as human and horse must work in
   tandem (particularly given their size) and the handler must be able to
   anticipate the horse's behavior to ensure the safety of all involved
   and get the shots. You can see the nuance of the encouragement and
   technique of the handlers in the behind the scenes video above,
   especially since the horses were being asked to enter a very foreign,
   enclosed space.

   For retouching, Burba turned to his good friends at Image-Rehab, with
   whom he has a longstanding relationship that he says allowed him to
   have the trust to hand over the shots from such an ambitious project.

   I've been around horses my entire life, and I've never seen photos
   remotely like these, so I'd just like to express my personal admiration
   for Burba's stunning work. I might just have to convince him to come
   take a shot of my horse.

   You can purchase limited edition prints from the project here. Be sure
   to check out Burba's website, Underlook, and follow him on Facebook.

   Thank you so much Alex for writing this article, those images are
   simply stunning!
   And while it never occurred to me to look at the under side of a horse,
   or any animal for that matter, I'm glad someone else did. It is
   inspiring when an artist figures out a surprising way to show you a
   subject that has been done to death. Horses have been photographed and
   painted throughout history as a noble, powerful & useful animal, and
   now, Andrius Burba showed us the vulnerable side of this beautiful
   creature. Two thumbs up Andrius Burba, I'm a fan!
