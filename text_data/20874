Dry Brush
       Dry brushing has tons of benefits—it stimulates your lymphatic
       system, exfoliates your skin, helps with circulation, and can help
       reduce the appearance of scars, cellulite, and stretch marks.

The Book of Joy
       This book changed my life.  I checked this book out from the
       library hoping for just something. And I got it. It was incredibly
       inspiring without being pushy or guilt-inducing. It was just
       exactly what I needed, at the exact time I needed it. I immediately
       bought my own copy, and now I recommend it to everyone.
