   Album Out Now!


ABOUT THE ARTIST

   I am Ultra Nat√© and am based in Baltimore, Maryland as a singer,
   songwriter, DJ, producer and promoter.
   I have released nine studio LPs [1990-2013] and travel around the globe
   performing and spinning
   live for a variety of audiences.
   I've been writing my own songs since the beginning of my career. This
   was pivotal in establishing me as an artist with a distinct style all
   my own. I was one of the first artists in house/dance music signed to a
   major record deal with Warner Brothers in the UK in 1989 and I have
   more than 25 years of experience making groundbreaking music having
   collaborated with a wide array of artists such as: The Basement Boys,
   Nellee Hooper, D-Inflience, Mood II Swing, Nona Hendryx, Lenny Kravitz,
   N'Dea Davenport, DJ Class, NERVO, Tony Moran, StoneBridge, Todd Terry,
   David Morales, Michele Williams (of Destiny's Child), Boy George,
   Morgan Page, Quentin Harris and others!
   My sound embraces a variety of genres including house, soul, disco,
   electro pop, R&B/hiphop and rock and I am honored to be considered an
   icon of the Dance and LGBT communities worldwide.
