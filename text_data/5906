   Why Couples Aren't Booking You for Their Wedding Photography

Why Couples Aren't Booking You for Their Wedding Photography

   If you are building a wedding photography business and are having a
   hard time getting bookings - read and implement some of these ideas to
   help you out.

   Nobody wants to hire you for their wedding photography. It’s not fair,
   is it?

   Your photographs are gorgeous, you’ve created a shiny new website, and
   you’re more loveable than a bucket of kittens. So why isn’t your phone
   ringing off the hook with people wanting to hire you for their wedding?

   Be different - Why Aren’t Any Couples Booking You for Their Wedding
   Photography
   It’s easy to start doubting yourself and going a little crazy. Maybe
   your photographs aren’t as good you thought. Are your prices too high,
   or too low? Perhaps all your competitors are secretly dating wedding
   planners?

   The reality is that these days it requires a little more savvy to be a
   successful wedding photographer. It’s because there may actually be
   more wedding photographers on the planet than there are stars in the
   solar system. So, let’s help you shine brighter than everyone else in
   your area with some simple, practical ideas for getting more wedding
   photography bookings.

   Your photography style
   There are so many different styles of wedding photography.
   Photojournalistic, posed, quirky and fun, romantic, fashion,
   traditional, highly retouched, and so on.

   Pick a style that you love to photograph and then specialize in it.
   Only show that style of photography in all your marketing. Ideally,
   it’s a style that most of your competitors aren’t using. The more
   defined you can make it, the better because people who love that style
   will be drawn to you.

   Your photography style - Why Aren’t Any Couples Booking You for Their
   Wedding Photography
   Yes, you will repel some people, but it’s better to have 20% of people
   love your work than having 100% of people just say that it’s “nice”.

   People buy from people they like and trust
   Hiring a wedding photographer is a huge decision for a bride and groom.
   They have to pay a large sum of money to have a stranger stand by their
   side all day on one of the most important days of their life. They’ve
   got so many concerns spinning around their head. For example:

   Is this photographer going to be rude, or just plain dull?
   What happens if we don’t like the photographs? After all, most
   photographers can cobble together a decent portfolio. But can they do a
   good job in tough conditions?
   What happens if it rains?
   Will the photographer be able to cope with my crazy family?
   Will they actually turn up?!
   Is it even possible for me to look good in a photograph?
   Will they be able to keep us on schedule?
   Will the group photographs be as painfully boring and time-consuming as
   I fear?
   The list goes on.

Should I Book a Professional Wedding Photographer or Get a Friend to do it

   You've probably seen similar discussions to this on other wedding
   blogs, however today I wanted to share with you this cautionary tale
   from a bride who had personal experience of taking the cheaper option
   and was unhappy with the results. Now, I know spending £2000 on a
   wedding photographer isn't possible for everyone, however the point of
   this post is not to bully you into paying for someone you can't afford.
   No, I wanted to share this story with you so that you make your
   decision with your eyes wide open. I just want to be open and honest
   with you and to let you know that, as with most things in life, you
   really do get what you pay for...and if something sounds too good to be
   true then it probably is.If wedding photograph isn't that big a deal to
   you, the great - who am I to tell you that's wrong? However it breaks

   If wedding photography isn’t that big a deal to you, the great – who am
   I to tell you that’s wrong? However it breaks my heart when I hear from
   newlyweds that say “I wish we’d thought more about our photography. We
   spent more on the cake/my dress/the flowers and now we have no good
   photos to remember our day”.

   OK, Over to you Mrs X…

   ♥  ♥  ♥

   I have asked for this post to be anonymous so that people reading this
   don’t think it’s a shameless marketing ploy. I may now be a
   professional wedding photographer myself, but I didn’t want to write
   this article to promote myself. No, I really just wanted to share this
   cautionary tale with those of you who might not understand the
   importance of having great wedding photographs.

   It’s been a few years since I got married but when I think back to it I
   get a sick feeling.  It wasn’t the family argument that happened (don’t
   get me started on that!), nor was it the fact that we funded it with a
   loan which we are still paying off.  Nope, the sick feeling is purely
   centred around my foolishness and the pretty terrible images we now
   have to look back on for the rest of our lives.

   Here I am a few years later, now a ‘pro’ photographer myself (who knew
   that would happen!!) and I now have a new found understanding of the
   skills required to shoot a wedding. I find myself wishing I knew then
   what I know now. You may have read articles from photographers before
   staying how important it is that your wedding photographer has
   experience, knows how to handle lighting and uses the right equipment
   etc, and while I am here to reiterate these points, I’m not here to say
   these things to pimp my own services. I figured this article could be a
   little cathartic for me and I really hope I can help you think a little
   bit more about your decision – whether that be to spend money on your
   wedding photography, or to go for the cheaper option of hiring someone
   with no experience – maybe a friend with a nice camera who has offered
   to do it for free. Please note that a ‘nice camera’ does not a good
   wedding photographer make!

   We got married in December and I now appreciate that winter weddings,
   where you come out of the ceremony to the cold and dark, are bloody
   hard work and really difficult to photograph.  I understand that
   romantic candle lit receptions might look gorgeous in ‘real life’ but
   require a certain level of skill to capture on camera, and above all I
   now know that all of the money I spent making the venue look beautiful
   and cosy was pretty much wasted.  OK so our guests will always remember
   how beautiful the venue looked, but for me the day flew by so fast and
   I don’t remember much of it myself!  Every time I mention my wedding my
   Mum says “But it looked so beautiful” and whilst I’m sure that’s not
   just her being kind (it’s really not her style) it has made me hate my
   own wedding because I don’t look back at my photos and see a beautiful
   wedding, I look at them and see horribly dark and blurry photos.

   You see, not realising the true impact of what I was doing, I asked my
   friend to shoot my big day.  He had a DSLR and could take amazing
   pictures of cars so he must be able to shoot my winter wedding right?
   Wrong!

   It wasn’t his fault really, I should have learnt more, understood a bit
   about light (or lack of it) and made things easier.  But here’s the
   worst part, I wasn’t on a £1000 budget, I spent quite a lot more.  I
   prioritised wrongly.  I spent more on bridesmaids dresses than I did on
   my photographer, more on pretty decorations than pretty images…simply
   put, I was a fool!

   Don’t get me wrong, I know not everyone has the budget to pay much for
   their wedding photographer and this is not an article to make you feel
   bad.  I say use whoever you want – a professional, a friend,
   whoever…it’s your wedding after all. But I urge you to do your research
   first and go into it knowing that the results of the cheap option just
   won’t be the same as someone with experience shooting weddings.

17 Reasons You Need to Hire a Wedding Planner in 2017 | Washington DC

   You’re engaged–congratulations! Planning your wedding sounds like the
   dream job you’ve been waiting for, right? While it can be fun, there
   are a lot of issues and stressful situations that can arise with
   wedding planning. If you’re in the midst of planning, you may be ready
   to pull your hair out!  If you’re not at that stage yet, here are 17
   reasons why hiring a wedding a planner is one of the best decisions you
   will make!

   1. Time

   Between your 10-hour work days, CrossFit, Pilates, fiancé, dog,
   girlfriends, family, the list goes on, researching vendors and dealing
   with the 100s of additional emails you will be receiving is something
   you just don’t have time for! A full-service wedding planner will
   eliminate all of the research, emails, phone calls back and forth
   between the many, many vendors, and only present to you the top options
   meeting your criteria.

   2. Budget

   You have an idea of how much you’re comfortable spending, but have no
   idea how it all breaks down. Math?!–No way, Jose’! An experienced
   wedding planner can take your number of guests, and provide a suggested
   budget breakdown of how much funds should be allocated to each
   category. An exceptional wedding planner will then listen to you (the
   client!) and determine what needs to be increased/decreased based on
   your must-haves. As planning progresses, the planner should provide
   budget updates and also seek ways to give you the most bang for you
   buck, if needed.

   3. Vendor Recommendations

   Wedding planners work with many vendors, some they may be more fond of
   than others. They can suggest vendors who they know have done stellar
   jobs, as well as ones they know will be within budget. Some brides and
   grooms might be concerned that wedding planners are being compensated
   or receiving “kick-backs” for recommending certain vendors. While there
   may be some planners who do accept referral fees, at SRS Events, we do
   not receive any sort of vendor compensation, so you can be assured the
   vendors recommended are truly due to their excellent services.

   4. Timeline

   You know what you want to happen during your wedding day, but you don’t
   know how much time to allocate for each event or activity. A wedding
   planner will be able to take your overarching vision, and create a
   realistic timeline that will then be shared with all vendors and
   wedding party, so everyone is on the same page. If there are questions
   or issues, your wedding planner will be listed as the contact, so you
   do not have to deal with a barrage of phone calls.

   5. Details

   A wedding planner is detail-oriented and organized. (If they’re not,
   they should not be a wedding planner!) Your planner will think-thru all
   events and what’s needed to make them a success. For example, having a
   unity candle lighting during the ceremony? Your wedding planner will
   make sure the candle lighter is on the table so you won’t be left
   hanging during the ceremony!

   6. Onsite

   Aside from the vendor research and bookings, one of the other main
   reasons brides and grooms hire a wedding planner is for onsite peace of
   mind. The bride can sip mimosas with her bridesmaids and the groom
   might indulge in a Scotch, all while not having to worry about the
   seating cards and ensuring the candy bar is set up, as the wedding
   planner has got it all handled.

   7. Ideas

   Maybe you have a Pinterest full of wedding inspiration or you just have
   no idea where to start, except for maybe knowing you want blush as a
   wedding color or peonies in your bouquet. A wedding planner can take
   your inspiration and suggest budget-friendly ways to bring it to life.
   Or, the planner can help craft the bride’s and groom’s vision for the
   day.

   8. Ceremony information

   You know you will say your vows and have your first kiss as husband and
   wife, but what else needs to go into the ceremony? The wedding planner
   can offer suggestions, as well as provide tips on crafting your
   ceremony programs.

   9. Coordinate other events

   If you’re seeking recommendations for a rehearsal dinner or
   post-wedding brunch, a wedding planner can offer suggestions, or even
   be booked to ensure these events go off without a hitch!

   10. End of night

   You have your big sparkler exit planned, but what about the gifts,
   cards, guest book, cake topper, the list goes on! The wedding planner
   will be there to ensure all of the valuables make it to their correct
   home and nothing gets left behind.

   11. Communication

   Emails, emails, emails–I think this says it all, right?

   12. Mediator

   Not seeing eye-to-eye with your fiancé, mother, or mother-in-law? A
   wedding planner can serve as a mediator in this aspect, and convey your
   thoughts and vision as a third-party. Hearing it from a neutral contact
   can help remove any negative thoughts and persuade them to your point
   of view.

   13. Seating suggestions

   You have this huge open space and want to do something a little
   different than the traditional banquet rounds. A wedding planner can
   look at the space, dimensions, number of guests, and provide unique
   seating recommendations that will enhance your reception. On the flip
   side, you have all these guests, and are not sure where you’re going to
   fit them all! Once a again, the wedding planner can provide creative
   suggestions to ensure the takeaway from your wedding wasn’t how cramped
   it was!

   14. Hotel room block

   If you need a hotel room block, a wedding planner can work with hotels
   to negotiate a great rate and contract. Some wedding planners, such as
   myself, come from a corporate events background, where hotel
   negotiations were the norm. Having this background allows the planner
   to know what clauses need to be included or struck from the contract.
   They may also negotiate benefits or upgrades, known as “concessions.”

   Why We Didn't Hire a Wedding Planner... But Wish We Had

   huffingtonpost.com

Why We Didn't Hire a Wedding Planner... But Wish We Had

   In the early stages of preparing for our big day, we decided not to
   employ the services of a wedding planner... but in hindsight, oh, how I
   wish we had! ...

   In the early stages of preparing for our big day, we decided not to
   employ the services of a wedding planner… but in hindsight, oh, how I
   wish we had!

   Why we didn’t
   We had very little debate about whether or not to bring a wedding
   planner on board. Quite simply, I wanted us to handle all the
   preparations and vendor research ourselves. I thought it would be fun
   to do the research, and also felt that us looking into the suppliers
   was the only way to know all the options… so that we could make a truly
   informed decision and ensure we got the style we liked at the most
   reasonable price — not simply a wedding planner’s “usual” contacts. My
   groom was more than happy with this conclusion, since it saved us an
   extra line item in our bridal budget… and we were indeed worried that a
   wedding planner would be quite expensive.

   Why we wish we had
   • Wedding tasks aren’t always fun. Sure, it’s a ball to ooh and aah
   over cake designs, but there’s nothing enjoyable about researching
   mini-buses for guest transport or making seating charts. There isn’t
   much joy in reviewing vendor contracts or keeping track of payments,
   either. Contrary to what I had thought, hiring a wedding planner
   doesn’t mean outsourcing your entire wedding; a wedding planner only
   handles what you want them to (support at the start to get you on the
   right track, on-the-day coordination only, or indeed the whole shebang)
   so won’t take over and choose your final bouquet design for you. So if
   do you want to drive your wedding planning, you can focus on the fun
   parts… and leave the boring bits to someone else.

   • Wedding planning is stressful. Wedding planning is not the romantic
   experience one expects it to be. There are many details to take care
   of, meddling family and friends might drive you crazy and vendors can
   be a source of drama. During our engagement, several recently married
   friends told me that in the final month before the wedding they had
   been so exhausted that they just wanted the day to be over. This ended
   up being true for me: in the final week I lost five pounds from stress,
   burst into tears a few times and my groom and I were snapping at each
   other. This is not how anyone’s planning should be. Bringing on board a
   professional planner to help and take some of the workload off our
   hands definitely would have made sense (and they probably could have
   given advice on managing family drama).

   • We weren’t that great at choosing vendors after all. Despite thinking
   that researching vendors ourselves was the only way to ensure we could
   make the best supplier decisions, this didn’t work out so swimmingly.
   Out of 15 or so wedding day vendors, there were only three that we were
   actually totally happy with… and some others we were extremely unhappy
   with. When we started out planning, we had organized less than one
   wedding… why did we think our judgment would be better than that of a
   professional, who has seen these vendors in action at more than one
   (and perhaps several, and perhaps many!) weddings? Why did I think a
   planner would force us into choosing a vendor we weren’t completely
   happy with?

   • We didn’t know what to look for in a vendor. Other than a little
   Google research before interrogating potential vendors via email, we
   really had no idea what to ask. For example, after contacting 20
   different hairdressers for quotes, I realized I had to specify if I was
   planning an up- or down-do to get accurate pricing… so had to email
   them all over again. We asked cake makers for price quotes for a
   three-tier cake, but it didn’t occur to us to ask about the height of
   the tiers… until two months before the wedding, when we found out the
   “magnificent” wedding cake we were paying hundreds of dollars for was
   only nine inches tall, and we’d now have to shell out twice as much
   money to get it to the grandeur that we wanted.

   • Wedding planning takes time. Until you really get into the
   preparations for your big day, it is impossible to fathom how much work
   is involved and how many details need to be taken care of. I know
   brides who have taken leave from work in order to have more time to
   prepare their weddings. If you work long hours, have lots of hobbies or
   have children to look after, and don’t want to be completely drowning
   in to-do lists during your engagement, a wedding planner handling some
   of those tasks for you could be a real lifesaver. Also, you really
   don’t want to get in trouble at the office by getting caught doing
   wedding planning on company time!
