Basic FAQ

How do I add my Instagram Account?

   Login to your account, click on the Instagram Icon. Enter your
   Instagram Username and Password, then Save.

Can I Pay Annually instead of the Monthly Payment?

   Yes. We have annual plans with 20% discounts. You’ll see this option at
   checkout.

Is my account at risk for Using Your Tools?

   Your account is not in any way at risk if you follow the safety method
   we’ve laid out.

   Do not Use the Fast or Very Fast speed options if you’re running
   multiple functions at the same time.

   And for new Users, Always start with the Very Slow Speed option for the
   first few days, you can increase this to Medium, then Fast after some
   weeks.

Does Gramto Sell Followers & Likes?

   We do not sell followers, neither do we sell likes as this is against
   Instagram TOS.

   What we offer is to perform Instagram activities on your behalf..

Technical FAQ

How Does the System Speed Works?

   Gramto comes with different speed options, and each option has the
   maximum function is can perform daily. Below is a breakdown of how
   speed works;
     *
          + Very Slow – 24 Requests Daily
          + Slow – 48 Requests Daily
          + Medium – 72 Requests Daily
          + Fast – 96 Requests Daily
          + Very Fast – 120 Requests Daily
          + Auto (From Very Slow to Fast)

   Note that each of the tools is independent of one another. Meaning you
   can set to Auto Follow and also run unfollow at the same time.

   However, we advised strongly against going too fast to avoid putting
   your account at risk.

Can I Upload multiple files?

   Yes. If you have a large number of files to upload from your PC, you
   can upload 10 files at a time to your Gramto account.

Why can't I Auto Repeat My Posts?

   We disabled Auto-repeat function because it places your Instagram
   account at risk. If you need to repeat a Post, kindly save the caption
   and you can always re-use.

   And we strongly advise changing of Caption or Images when repeating
   posts.

I have more than 10 Instagram Accounts. Is there a plan for me?
