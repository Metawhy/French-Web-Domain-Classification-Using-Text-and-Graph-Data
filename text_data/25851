   Adam Frank 2018

ADAM FRANK

   Professor of Astrophysics
   University of Rochester

     “Unless nature is perversely biased against civilizations like ours,
     we’re not the first one to appear.”

   — Adam Frank



   Adam Frank is an astrophysicist and leading expert on the evolution of
   stars and planets.

   As a self-described “evangelist of science,” Frank is committed to
   showing others the beauty and power of science. This commitment fuels
   his work as a scholar, author, and speaker. In his new book, Light of
   the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth (W.W.Norton, June
   2018), Frank poses big questions about alien civilizations, climate
   change, and what life on other worlds tells us about our own fate.

   “Skillfully written…. With an evenhanded approach to issues like the

   persuasive, smooth prose, Frank offers a new take on humanity’s place
   in this ‘vast and ancient metropolis of stars.’”

   civilizations whose failure to appear may be a warning for humans to
   get their act together.”

Earth Will Survive. We May Not.

   The New York Times

   "We speak of “saving” the Earth as if it were a little bunny in need of
   help. We show images of gaunt polar bears on melting ice floes to
   elicit guilt and environmental action. But those images and stories
   blind us to the reality of this remarkable moment in Earth’s history.
   Our planet does not need our saving. [...] What Earth’s history does
   makes clear, however, is that if we don’t take the right kind of action
   soon the biosphere will simply move on without us, creating new
   versions of itself in the changing climate we’re generating now."

How Do Aliens Solve Climate Change?

   The Atlantic

   “The universe does many things. It makes galaxies, comets, black holes,
   neutron stars, and a whole mess more. We’ve lately discovered that it
   makes a great deal of planets, but it’s not clear whether it regularly
   makes energy-hungry civilizations, nor is it clear whether such
   civilizations inevitably drive their planets into climate change.
   There’s lots of hope riding on our talk about building a sustainable
   civilization on Earth. But how do we know that’s even possible? Does
   anyone across the cosmos ever make it?”

Was There a Civilization on Earth Before Humans?

   The Atlantic

   “We’re used to imagining extinct civilizations in terms of the sunken
   statues and subterranean ruins. These kinds of artifacts of previous
   societies are fine if you’re only interested in timescales of a few
   thousands of years. But once you roll the clock back to tens of
   millions or hundreds of millions of years, things get more complicated.
   Given that all direct evidence would be long gone after many millions
   of years, what kinds of evidence might then still exist? Could
   researchers find clear evidence that an ancient species built a
   relatively short-lived industrial civilization long before our own?”

RADIO AND VIDEO COMMENTARY

     * NPR’s
       All Things Considered
       Whether discussing climate change policy, the search for aliens, or
       the mysterious nature of dark matter, Frank is a regular voice on
       NPR’s All Things Considered.
     * NPR blog
       13.7: Cosmos and Culture
       Frank co-founded the popular NPR blog 13.7: Cosmos and Culture as a
       place where scientists could talk about science as a force in
       everyday life, informing questions of religion and spirituality,
       human identity, and human beings’ relationships to each other and
       the natural world.
     * Science consultant on the Marvel film
       Doctor Strange
       In the 2016 Marvel Studio’s film Doctor Strange, the titular
       character gets his powers from sorcery and mysticism. To understand
       Dr. Strange, however, you need to understand Marvel’s consistent
       universe of science.
     * Segment in PBS documentary
       Into the Night
       “Just because the cosmic drama is large, doesn’t mean my place in
       it is any less significant.” Frank’s research on the final stages
       of evolution for stars, and his own personal experiences with
       death, inform a fascinating look at science and spirituality and
       how our place in the cosmos is an unrelenting mystery.
     * TEDxRochester talk
       There is a widespread idea that science and religion are at war and
       will always be at war with one another. The founders of science,
       however, were all deeply religious men and women. Talking about
       science and religion in other ways besides this “warfare”
       illuminates science as a gateway to the human experience of the
       sacred.
     * Research discussion: Could alien civilizations predict the fate of
       our planet?
       On Earth, we are very concerned with developing a sustainable
       version of civilization. However, the question we can ask if we
       step back and take the 10,000-light-year view is: How do we know if
       sustainability is even possible?



LATEST RESEARCH

     * Alien apocalypse: Can any civilization make it through climate
       change? (June 2018)
       Earned media press: The Guardian, Popular Science, Newsweek,
       Scientific American
       Does the universe contain planets with truly sustainable
       civilizations? Or does every civilization that may have arisen in
       the cosmos last only a few centuries before it falls to the climate
       change it triggers? A new mathematical model illustrates how a
       technologically advanced population and its planet might develop
       together, putting climate change in a cosmic context.
     * We think we’re the first advanced earthlings—but how do we really
       know? (April 2018)
       Earned media press: Washington Post, Newsweek, The Daily Mail,
       Scientific American, NBC News
       Imagine if, many millions of years ago, dinosaurs drove cars
       through cities of mile-high buildings. A preposterous idea, right?
       This compelling “thought experiment,” conducted with Gavin Schmidt
       at NASA, poses the question: How do we really know there weren’t
       previous industrial civilizations on Earth that rose and fell long
       before human beings appeared? And, what evidence might future
       scientists, millions of years from now, detect to determine our own
       civilization existed?
     * Astrophysicist meets Marvel movie as Doctor Strange science
       consultant (November 2016)
       The makers of the 2016 Marvel Studios blockbuster Doctor Strange
       wanted the fantasy film to have scientific substance. For help,
       they turned to Adam Frank, who discusses his role as a science
       consultant on the film. In the episode of the University’s Quadcast
       podcast, Frank discusses his role on the film.
     * Are we alone? Setting some limits to our uniqueness (April 2016)
       Rochester Review
       Odds are, we aren’t the first advanced civilization in the
       universe. The recent discovery of exoplanets combined with a
       broader approach to questions of life on other planets, makes it
       possible to assign a new empirically-valid probability to the odds
       of other advanced technological civilizations.



   he International Space Station continues its orbit around the Earth as
   Expedition 50 astronauts captured this night image of sparkling cities
   and a sliver of daylight framing the northern hemisphere.
