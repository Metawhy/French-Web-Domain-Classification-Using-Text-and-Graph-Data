   Comprehensive thematic data collection in OSM: implementing the
   healthsites.io platform in Senegal
   CartONG has been partnering with the Global Healthsites mapping project
   since 2017. We recently had the opportunity to test the Healthsites.io
   platform at full scale with its complete data workflow during a data
   collaborative project in Senegal, that was implemented with the support
   of Geomatica and the OSM local community.

   CartONG endorses the 9 Principles for Digital Development!
   As part of the process of designing a comprehensive Associative Project
   in early 2019, CartONG decided it was a natural step forward for our
   organization to officially endorse the principles for Digital
   development, as our actions are based on strong principles that are
   fully aligned with all 9 of them. Read more here.

   Strengthening Scientific Impact Evaluations through mapping: case study
   in Tunisia with the evaluation of PRIQH2
   At the end of 2018, CartONG was selected by the French Development
   Agency to participate in the scientific impact evaluation of the
   Program for the Rehabilitation and Integration of Housing Districts
   implemented in Tunisia (PRIQH2), with the aim of adding a mapping
   dimension to the program's evaluation methodology. This initiative is a
   new approach also for CartONG.

   Participatory mapping: a relevant tool for reducing gender-based
   violence
   CartONG was in Haiti in June as part of the project "Our City is Safer
   for Women", an initiative led by CARE's office in Jeremie and funded by
   UN Women, for giving a training in participatory mapping methodologies.

   The Map Centre V2: an online GIS platform developed by CartONG to
   support MSF staff at HQ and in the field
   CartONG provides GIS and mapping services in support to the MSF
   GIS-Unit since 2013. As part of our support, CartONG has designed the
   Map Centre platform: a full-custom application, which acts as a single
   point of entry to access all geographical products used by MSF for its
   activities. Watch our video to discover some of its main
   functionalities!

   CartONG is proud to present its 2019 Associative Project
   Since its creation and the drafting of its statutes in 2006, CartONG
   had not updated any document defining its global objectives. With the
   growth and diversification of our activities in recent years, it had
   become necessary to draft an associative project that would clarify the
   social contribution of our organization to society, specify its fields
   of expertise, (re)define its values and detail our growth over the past
   13 years – so as to guide future developments.
