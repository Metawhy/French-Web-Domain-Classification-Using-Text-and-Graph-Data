MIRRORLESS REINVENTED

   Show what you see with Nikon Z cameras and NIKKOR Z lenses. Nikon’s
   mirrorless system is built around the world’s widest lens mount¹, which
   lets you capture more light. With more light, comes more detail, more
   depth, more colour. Incredible photos. Mesmerising movies.

   [Z7_Z6_top.png]

It’s never just the light. It’s what you see in the light.

   When you have an ultra-wide mount, a full-frame sensor, blazing fps,
   and edge-to-edge sharpness to work with—you get the freedom to create
   more.

More light. More impact.

   S-Line NIKKOR Z lenses. Faster. Quieter. Sharper. The ultra-wide Nikon
   Z mount enables compact full-frame lenses that can take in more light
   across the entire frame. Bright is brighter. Depth is deeper. Sharpness
   is all the way to the edge.

Nikon Z. The game changer.

   When we created the Nikon Z camera we didn’t just create a new camera.
   We reimagined what a mirrorless camera can do. Superior ergonomics make
   these cameras feel like a Nikon. The ultra-wide mount and advanced
   optical technology redefine what’s possible to create.

   used to select which eye the camera focuses on, even when looking
   through the Electronic View Finder.

Your vision. Your voice.

   Bring your ideas into the light. When you have a fast full-frame sensor
   to shoot with you have the power to make your mark.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

All the way sharp

   The back-illuminated 24.5 MP full-frame CMOS sensor with focal-plane AF
   captures richly detailed, razor-sharp images.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Beyond fast

   The blazing EXPEED 6 image processor delivers images with low noise and
   stunning dynamic range at both high and low ISO values.

Z mount. More light. More possibilities.

   With the world’s widest full-frame lens mount, the agile Z 6 mirrorless
   camera can capture light as never before.¹
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Big mount. Big impact.

   The wide 55 mm mount diameter means your Z series camera takes in more
   light. Just 16 mm between the mount and the camera’s full-frame image
   sensor means more of that light reaches the sensor.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Inspired by light

   From twilight blues to graphic shadows. The powerful optical design of
   Nikon Z mount lenses, combined with the wide mount, gives you the power
   to work magic with light.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

One adapter. Endless inspiration.

   With the Mount Adapter FTZ attached to your Z 6 camera, you’re free to
   use existing F-mount NIKKOR lenses. There’s no loss of image quality.
   Plus non-VR lenses will find new levels of sharpness with in-camera VR.

   FIND OUT MORE

100–51200 ISO. Inspired, even after dark.

   From 3am city scenes to low-light portraits, you have the freedom to
   catch details in the dark.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

That look. That moment.

   [lazy_2x1.gif]

   With Eye-Detection AF, your Nikon Z camera can lock onto your subject’s
   eye whether they’re alone or a face in a crowd. You select which eye to
   focus on via the multi-selector, and the camera maintains focus even if
   the eye is briefly obscured.
   Read less

   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Create widely

   Stay sharp with ultra-wide autofocus (AF) coverage across 90 % of the
   frame. Combined with the incredible focusing power of Nikon Z mount
   lenses, even subjects at the edge of the frame are easily detected. And
   vertical shooting is incredibly precise.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Focus freely

   The AF system spots movement instantly. Even small or fast-moving
   subjects are tracked with absolute precision in any light. And you can
   use Pinpoint AF mode to hone in on the smallest details.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Inside the light

   Exposure metering down to -4 EV is available when shooting with a lens
   that has a maximum aperture of f/2 or faster. Find nuance in shadow.
   Lock onto details even when the only light is the light of the moon.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Capture the expression

   An intelligent Face-Detection-AF processor detects and holds faces.
   That glance. That expression. It’s yours—even if someone is moving
   quickly.

Timing is everything

   12 fps continuous shooting. Find full frames of beauty inside the
   action.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Rock-steady Vibration Reduction

   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Steady

   In-camera five-axis optical Vibration Reduction (VR) compensates for
   camera shake in five directions. Stills stay sharp. Video is steady.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Action

   Sport Mode delivers a stable viewfinder image when shooting
   exceptionally fast action, or when panning. When shooting video, the
   five-axis optical VR works with electronic VR to deliver incredibly
   steady footage.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Five-stop advantage

   The in-camera five-axis optical VR lets you shoot at shutter speeds up
   to five stops slower than otherwise possible.² Shoot clearer photos as
   daylight fades or film scenes without the unwanted effects of camera
   shake.

If you can see it – you can catch it

   Compose freely. Nikon’s advanced 3686k-dot electronic viewfinder keeps
   the view smooth. The ultra-bright, ultra-sharp EVF doesn’t leave
   anything out of the frame.
     * Robust
     * Sharp
     * Versatile

   Aspherical glass elements and protective coatings prevent flare,
   reflections, and dirt from limiting your view. You’ll see everything
   clearly, whether you’re exploring the night or shooting in bright
   daylight.

   The large, clear OLED EVF reproduces colours naturally and handles
   motion smoothly. Sharp, stable images make composition comfortable—even
   if you’re panning quickly or have zoomed in to confirm focus.

   The EVF can display images as they’ll look with settings applied—or you
   can go with a natural image, similar to that of an optical viewfinder.
   You can overlay key shooting information to aid composition in either
   view.

Pure expressionism

   Shoot every scene in exquisite detail with full-frame 4K video.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Mesmerising action

   Record full-frame 4K/UHD movies at 30p. Achieve enthralling slow motion
   with richly detailed Full HD movies at up to 120p. You can
   easily capture still frames while filming in 4K or Full HD.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

High resolution

   Oversampling from 6K enables 4K footage with spectacular fineness and
   detail. The fast EXPEED 6 processor ensures beautifully clean files,
   remarkably free of noise, moiré, and false colour.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Beautiful control

   Bright Nikon Z mount lenses offer silent autofocus and exquisite bokeh.
   And you can get an assist from in-camera focus peaking as you manually
   rack focus through a scene.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Stable motion

   AF speed and AF tracking sensitivity can be set during movie recording.
   The incredible focusing power of Nikon Z mount lenses reduces the
   unwanted effects of focus breathing, and focus shift when zooming.

CUT. RECUT. INSPIRE.

   On location or in the editing suite – find your flow.
     * 10-bit N-Log
     * Active D-Lighting
     * Timecode output

   Create character. Record at a high 10-bit depth and retrieve 4x more
   information than with a standard 8-bit recording, giving you maximum
   image quality for editing and grading. Activate View Assist to see a
   standard image with simple grading compensation.

   Balance the light. In-camera Active D-Lighting balances lights and
   shadows in high-contrast scenes. Perfect for footage that needs to be
   ready to go as soon as you’re wrapped.

   Stay in tune. Record timecode in drop-frame or non-drop-frame formats,
   and output via 10-bit HDMI. The Z 6 is Atomos Open Protocol compatible:
   you can sync the start/stop of HDMI movie recording via your external
   recorder. Or via the camera.

STRETCH. BEND. TRANSFORM.

   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Built to resist

   A tough yet lightweight magnesium alloy body and extensive weather
   sealing are this camera’s ticket to anywhere. The durable,
   high-precision shutter has been tested for 200,000 cycles.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Crafted to angle

   The tilting LCD monitor lets you operate AF and shutter-release
   functions via touch controls. And the high-resolution display makes it
   easy to review shots under any light.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Made to grip

   The deep and secure grip of this camera feels like part of your hand.
   You’ll never want to put it down.
   [lazy_2x1.gif]

Created to use

   With key buttons and controls right where you want them, every response
   becomes second nature. No time to set the exposure or shutter speed?
   There’s always Auto mode.

COLLABORATE

   [lazy_2x1.gif]
