A New Generation of Backup & Recovery for Distributed Databases

A Disturbance in The Force

   On June 7, 2016, Datos IO announced the general availability of
   RecoverX, the industry’s first enterprise-class  backup and recovery
   software for applications running on distributed cloud databases. With
   capabilities such as scalable versioning and industry-first semantic
   deduplication, Datos IO RecoverX is ushering in a new generation of
   backup and recovery solutions for distributed database environments
   including DataStax (Apache Cassandra) and MongoDB.

   In the remainder of this article, I will examine previous generations
   of backup and recovery technology, provide an overview of RecoverX, and
   get to the bottom line of what this means to IT organizations.

   [disturbance-in-the-force.jpeg]

   I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of home-grown
   backup scripts cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear
   something terrible has happened.

Enterprise-Class Backup & Recovery

The Key to Business Continuity with New IT

   Every once in awhile, the benefits of a new information technology are
   so compelling that products are deployed even when there are
   shortcomings which normally would not be tolerated.  One recurring
   example is the lack of enterprise-class backup and recovery. During the
   infancy of networked servers, RDBMS systems, and virtual servers, IT
   organizations worked around the lack of good backup and recovery tools
   by developing scripts, by spending extra on storage to replicate data,
   and/or they suffered occasional downtime. Eventually companies like
   Legato and Veritas developed products designed for networked servers
   and SQL databases, and companies like Veeam emerged with software
   specifically for backup and recovery of virtual machines. The results
   in each case were enterprise-class solutions, superior to home-grown
   scripts, with greater automation, efficient use of storage, and the
   reliability needed to ensure business continuity.

Generations of Backup & Recovery Technology

   [Generations-of-Backup-Recovery-Technology.jpeg]

   Enterprise-class backup and recovery for distributed database
   management systems is the sixth wave of backup and recovery products
   needed to ensure business continuity when using an important new
   information technology.

A New Generation of Backup & Recovery Needed for Distributed Databases

   Products such as MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and Redis are perfect for
   taming the growing amount of unstructured data by processing
   transactions on many machines. But the distributed databases require
   all new backup and restore software because, 1) they are like herds of
   cats which roam across multiple servers, clusters, data centers, and
   even geographic regions, and 2) unlike relational databases consisting
   of  rows of data, distributed databases are a collection of key-value
   pairs, documents, graph databases or wide column stores.

   [A-New-Generation-of-Backup-Recovery-Needed-for-Distributed-Databases.p
   ng]

   According to  DB-Engines database popularity rankings, distributed
   databases are climbing the rankings fast.

RecoverX from Datos IO

Enterprise-Class Software for Backup & Recovery of Distributed Databases

   Because real-time applications are driving billions of dollars in
   business, enterprises are adopting high-volume, high-ingestion and
   real-time distributed databases. As migration to this data-centric IT
   infrastructure increases, enterprises must ensure that data can be
   managed at scale without data loss and application downtime.

   [before-snapshot-start-script.png]

   The state-of-the art for backup, recovery and repair of distributed
   databases includes home-grown scripts shared through tribal knowledge,
   and highly trained technicians familiar with the complicated repair
   process.

   Datos IO is led by a development team behind market-leading products
   and  billions of dollars of revenue at Data Domain (EMC), Delphix,
   Google, IBM Almaden Research Center, Netflix, Nimble Storage, and
   NetApp. RecoverX from Datos IO is scale-out backup and recovery
   software built from the ground-up for new distributed application
   environments, and stocked with a rich set of enterprise-class data
   protection services.  Here are just a few:

   For easy–of-use, RecoverX supports multiple popular databases including
   Apache Cassandra (DataStax Enterprise) and MongoDB; lightweight
   application listeners that communicate with data source via
   well-defined interfaces, and offers multiple options for secondary
   storage with both NFS and S3.

   For operational flexibility, database clusters can be added to a
   RecoverX environment in minutes, and RecoverX enables On-premise, Iaas
   and PaaS environments such as AWS and GCP, and backup version can be
   created at any interval and at any granularity

   For high-availability, RecoverX generates a point-in-time cluster
   consistent backup that reduces application downtime, and all backup
   operations are resilient to failures scenarios of node and database
   failures.

   For lower cost, backups are highly space efficient with the industry’s
   first semantic deduplication which can reduce required storage capacity
   by up to 70%.

   For recovery in minutes, RecoverX allows recovery back to a production
   database with the same or different topology, recovery back to a
   non-production or test/dev database with the same or different topology
   configuration, and the ability to recover data directly from secondary
   storage to a database. All recovery operations are resilient to failure
   scenarios of node and database failures.

   [Datos-IO-RecoverX.png]

   Datos IO Consistent Orchestrated Distributed Recovery (CODR)
   architecture delivers cluster-consistent backups that are highly space
   efficient, available in native formats, and offer repair-free recovery.

Before and After RecoverX

   Before you could not scale-out with distributed databases, storage, and
   data management tools – both for resiliency against hardware failures
   and for performance to meet RPO and RTO windows. RecoverX is
   architected for scale-out and deployed in a single node or a cluster
   configuration (3-node).

   Before you could not take a consistent backup copy, and given the large
   amount of data that is processed by these applications, execute a
   successful backup without bottlenecking data movement into and out of
   the cluster. RecoverX provides a true cluster-consistent point-in-time
   backup copy of distributed databases. A key benefit of
   cluster-consistent versioning is that there are not repairs when a
   version is restored and that results in reduced application downtime.

   Before you experienced very low recovery time objective (RTO) because
   manual steps during recovery translated into delays. In addition, if
   the restored data was not consistent, repairing the database would take
   hours to days. The RecoverX Orchestrated Restore process moves data in
   parallel to all nodes of a destination cluster. This removes all manual
   steps from the recovery process, reduces the recovery time and
   minimizes any data loss risk. In addition, the data that is restored is
   already consistent, hence, no repairs are required after the restore.
   The result is recovery times 4-5x faster than any other backup and
   recovery solution available today. RecoverX also provides 1-click
   recovery of a production database to Test/Dev environments. A version
   of a database can be restored from a 12-node production cluster to a
   3-node test cluster (test/dev instance) in a matter of minutes.

   Before you could not eliminate data redundancy and reduce storage
   costs. Data stored on distributed and cloud databases is most often
   stored in a 3-replica scheme where every write is replicated three
   times across the nodes of the database cluster. In addition,
   distributed databases offer native replication. However, replication
   results in data redundancy and increased storage requirements. Semantic
   de-duplication is an industry-first capability that Datos IO has
   developed specifically to reduce the cost of storing backup data over
   its retention period. As part of the versioning process, RecoverX
   removes the redundant data sets to make sure that the backup has no
   replicas of a primary data set, thus providing de-duplication of source
   data across all replicas. This ground breaking semantic de-duplication
   feature results in up to ~70% reduction in secondary storage

The Bottom Line

Datos IO is at The Right Place at The Right Time

   Distributed applications and databases comprise a small fraction of
   the $45B database, but represent the fastest growing segment of the
   market—and will continue to do so for years to come.

   The bottom line is ensuring business continuity is a basic requirement
   for distributed applications to reach their potential. That’s why Datos
   IO and enterprise-class backup and recovery for distributed databases
   is at the right place and the right time. RecoverX is “must-have”
   software for any enterprise IT organization tasked with supporting a
   business-critical distributed application environment.
