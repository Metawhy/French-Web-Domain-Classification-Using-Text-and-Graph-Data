                    # Boncel_2014-4-200
                      Orangutan of the Month for September, 2019: Boncel
                      Back to the Wild
                      The release of an orangutan back to the wild is a
                      culmination of many years of hard and dedicated
                      work. It is a profound moment when wild born
                      ex-captive orangutans are finally released and free

                      Explorer in the Making
                      Youth is a time when individuals are trying to find
                      their way through life. It is a time of
                      experimentation, trying new things, and seeing what
                      suits us. Through exploration and challenge, young
                      orangutan Mumui is learning more about herself and
                      her surroundings. In her own way she follows the
                      example of great explorers and [...]

                      Back to the Wild
                      The release of an orangutan back to the wild is a
                      culmination of many years of hard and dedicated
                      work. It is a profound moment when wild born
                      ex-captive orangutans are finally released and free
                      to live as they choose in the forest. It is not a
                      straight and narrow path and, very, very

Bear of the Month for March, 2019: Bonnie

   By Philip Stubley | On Mar 19, 2019

   “Bonnie Prince Charlie”, known as Bonnie for short, is a sensitive
   bear. If any bear needs a boost in self-confidence as a bear, it’s
   Bonnie. Having spent the first part of his life confined to a small
   cage, he became very shy. During his early days at the Orangutan Care
   Centre & Quarantine (OCCQ) in […]

Employee Spotlight: Ibu Yeti

   By Philip Stubley | On Feb 15, 2019

   When walking along the boardwalk en route to Camp Danielle, a facility
   at OFI’s Orangutan Care Center and Quarantine (OCCQ) in Borneo, you may
   hear what sounds like exasperated shouting followed by laughter. These
   are the sounds of the daily release of young orangutans in the Infant
   Playground and the Learning Forest. Chief among the […]

Bear of the Month for Feb, 2019: Raja

   By Philip Stubley | On Feb 15, 2019

   Raja is one of those bears who always appears to be grumpy.  This is
   due to his fleshy forehead, common among sun bears, that produces
   several layers of deep-seated wrinkles. However, beneath this seemingly
   frowning face are two innocent dark brown eyes that show no sign of
   malice whatsoever. Admittedly, at first Raja’s appearance can […]

News From The Field: Creatures of the Night

   By Philip Stubley | On Jan 11, 2019

   Dusk approaches along the banks of the Sekonyer River in Tanjung Puting
   National Park, the gateway to Camp Leakey. Orangutans have already made
   their nests and hunkered down for the night. In the national park,
   especially during the high season in July and August, holidaymakers
   slumber on the kelotoks (houseboats used for tourism) parked on […]

                      Back to the Wild
                      The release of an orangutan back to the wild is a
                      culmination of many years of hard and dedicated
                      work. It is a profound moment when wild born
                      ex-captive orangutans are finally released and free
                      to live as they choose in the forest. It is not a
                      straight and narrow path and, very, very

                      Explorer in the Making
                      Youth is a time when individuals are trying to find
                      their way through life. It is a time of
                      experimentation, trying new things, and seeing what
                      suits us. Through exploration and challenge, young
                      orangutan Mumui is learning more about herself and
                      her surroundings. In her own way she follows the

A day at OFI’s Playpen Facility at the Orangutan Care Center

   By Rowan Klaassen | In Visitor's Corner | 2 Comments
   Search for: ____________________ Search

   The orangutans at OFI’s Playpen Facility are about to finish their
   banana breakfast when I arrive around 8:30 in the morning. Today, I’m
   spending my day at this facility within OFI’s Orangutan Care Center and
   Quarantine to meet the orangutans and their caregivers, and to
   experience what it’s like to work here.
   For the caregivers, the day starts before 8:00 am when they begin
   feeding the orangutans breakfast. Now that the orangutans are busy
   eating, the caregivers are doing some grocery shopping at the
   “supermarket on wheels” which is just passing by. When I ask one of the
   caregivers about what she is eating, it turns out to be Indonesian ice
   cream. I admit to never having tried it and so one of the caregivers
   buys ice cream for all the humans at the facility. It is typical
   Indonesian hospitality and a good start of the day.

   When we’ve finished our ice cream and the orangutans have finished
   their breakfast, they are released from their night enclosures and
   brought to the playground behind the facility. This facility is home to
   orangutans aged three to five years – as such, it is somewhat
   equivalent to preschool. In order to ensure that these young orangutans
   get exercise and play time but are always well supervised, they spend
   their days outside at a huge playground full of enrichment items and
   activities. As the orangutans arrive at the playground in the morning,
   they immediately climb up the various swings, ropes, and tires that are
   suspended throughout the playground. Each caregiver makes a couple
   trips back and forth from the night enclosures to the playground, each
   time taking one or two orangutans with her (or him as there is one male
   caregiver at that facility).

   It seems that the orangutans at this facility can be divided into three
   categories: adventurous, naughty, and nice. Of course, the last group
   is by far the smallest and so a day at the playground proves to be hard
   work. While the naughty orangutans are always playfully charging the
   caregivers and softly nipping and pulling hair, the adventurous
   orangutans are escaping the playground and disappearing into the
   surrounding trees. For the caregivers, this means alternatively peeling
   naughty orangutans off of themselves and each other, and heading off
   into the surrounding secondary forest to bring back the wandering
   explorers. Other orangutans sneak back to the main facility, near their
   night enclosures, as they know that there is food to be found around
   the kitchen and storage rooms. In short, the life of a caregiver at the
   playpen facility is busy and hectic.

   Despite the sometimes stressful moments at the playground, the women
   working here are some of the most caring, loving, and funny people that
   I’ve ever met. No matter how naughty an orangutan is, they deal with
   him/her in a gentle and calm way. Instead of using force to make a
   naughty orangutan back off, the women here start calling loudly,
   dancing vigorously, making scary faces and moving their hands in
   growling motions. If things get really out of hand, they will take a
   piece of wood and bang it against the building’s framework, making a
   loud drumming sound.

   This unique way of handling orangutans is working out well for them.
   Especially when this ritual is performed by everyone at the same time
   to scare a larger infant orangutan, it is simply a hilarious but
   wonderful sight to see! Some of the five year old infants (who are
   almost small juveniles) weigh close to 30 pounds or more, so it is
   obvious why the caregivers don’t want to be nipped.

   The orangutans are kept in the playground as long as possible each day,
   and are only brought back to their night enclosures at the end of the
   working day. Around noon there is additional feeding, usually in the
   form of fruits such as bananas or oranges. This gets the orangutans
   really excited despite the fair amount of young leaves and forest
   fruits that are continuously available to them. Around one o’clock
   there is water and milk for drinking and after the orangutans get back
   to their night enclosures, there is dinner before sleep. It is the same
   schedule every day, but that’s good because young orangutans, just like
   young children, need consistency, routine, and dependability. Also,
   this daily routine ensures plenty of exciting time outside for our
   young red ape friends!
   Taking out the orangutans is heavy work, but the women at the Playpen
   Facility are happy to do it.

       The playpen area is a wonderful space for the older infants. How
       they love those half tire baskets for naps and the tire swings. I
       think we should say ALL of the infants are “nice” – – some are just
       extra spirited. (Ha ha)

                      Back to the Wild
                      The release of an orangutan back to the wild is a
                      culmination of many years of hard and dedicated
                      work. It is a profound moment when wild born
                      ex-captive orangutans are finally released and free
                      to live as they choose in the forest. It is not a
                      straight and narrow path and, very, very

                      Youth is a time when individuals are trying to find
                      their way through life. It is a time of

                      suits us. Through exploration and challenge, young
                      orangutan Mumui is learning more about herself and
                      her surroundings. In her own way she follows the

Orangutan of the Month for September, 2019: Boncel

   By Philip Stubley | On Sep 26, 2019

   The release of an orangutan back to the wild is a culmination of many
   years of hard and dedicated work. It is a profound moment when wild
   born ex-captive orangutans are finally released and free to live as
   they choose in the forest. It is not a straight and narrow path and,
   very, very occasionally, […]

   what suits us. Through exploration and challenge, young orangutan Mumui
   is learning more about herself and her surroundings. In her own way she
   follows the example of great explorers and […]

Bear of the Month for July, 2019: ORI

   By Philip Stubley | On Jul 20, 2019

   Some sun bears are instantly more recognisable than others, Ori is one
   of them, with his big head and wide set eyes. He sports a white bib
   like chest patch. During morning feeding he bounds into the communal
   area with gusto, requiring much “fuel for the fire” for the day to
   come. At the time […]

                      Back to the Wild
                      The release of an orangutan back to the wild is a
                      culmination of many years of hard and dedicated
                      work. It is a profound moment when wild born
                      ex-captive orangutans are finally released and free
                      to live as they choose in the forest. It is not a
                      straight and narrow path and, very, very

                      Youth is a time when individuals are trying to find

Building a New Orangutan Playground

   By Philip Stubley | In News | 0 Comments
   Search for: ____________________ Search

   The Orangutan Care Center and Quarantine (OCCQ) in Central Indonesian
   Borneo is constantly evolving to best serve the needs of orangutans and
   other wildlife under the care of Orangutan Foundation International
   (OFI). Sometimes, it is necessary to build entirely new structures to
   replace worn-out facilities or those that are no longer suitable for
   the growing orangutans in one way or another.

   One such example is Pondok Cempadak, an orangutan rehabilitation
   facility that used to be located across the road from the OCCQ in Pasir
   Panjang, Central Indonesian Borneo. The facility initially started out
   as a nursery for wild born ex-captive orangutan infants, but as they
   grew older, it became clear that the small trees in the vicinity were
   not sufficient to provide the increasingly larger orangutans with
   adequate exercise and forest-experience training, which are crucial
   components of the rehabilitation process. As a result, OFI built two
   new playgrounds behind the facility where the juvenile orangutans could
   play, swing, brachiate, and otherwise enjoy themselves.

   But this wasn’t enough. As much as the orangutans enjoyed their new
   playgrounds, the sight of a primary tropical peat swamp forest in the
   distance provided a constant lure. Consequently, the orangutans were
   perpetually escaping into the deep swamp forest beyond, forcing Pondok
   Cempadak staff to go around on their motorcycles in order to find and
   bring back the escapee orangutans. OFI staff came to the conclusion
   that Pondok Cempadak orangutans liked motorcycle rides.

   Clearly, it was time to build a new camp for these orangutans, one that
   was located and surrounded by the forest where they would not have to
   escape their facility to be able to access the forest, only to be
   brought back by staff on their motorbikes.

   This is when OFI’s sister organization, OFI Canada, stepped in to help,
   donating funds specifically toward the construction of a new pondok and
   playground facility through the generosity of the Youssef-Warren
   Foundation.

   While the Indonesian word “pondok” translates to “hut”, pondoks are
   much more than that at the OCCQ. Here, they are fully equipped
   facilities with kitchens, staff sleeping quarters, sleeping enclosures
   for the orangutans, and often more. Most pondoks even have at least one
   cat “on staff’ patrolling the area for rats which, in turn, helps to
   keep snakes away. This is Borneo, after all.

   Each pondok facility comprises several enclosures for orangutans of
   varying ages. For example, Pondok Dua cares for young juveniles and
   Pondok Danielle currently houses the infants. The new facility, Pondok
   Youssef-Warren Cempedak Two, is being built to house the older juvenile
   and younger adolescent orangutans who started out as infants in the old
   Pondok Cempadak facility.

   The first step in building a new pondok is to acquire raw materials,
   such as ironwood, valued in Indonesia for its strength and durability
   as well as for its cultural importance. Some Dayak people believe that
   ironwood protects them from dangerous animals, and accounts for the
   lack of tigers and elephants in Borneo. In many villages, laws exist to
   limit the exploitation of this vulnerable and valuable timber species.
   The price of ironwood has been going up as it is now mainly brought in
   from the mountains.

   After building the main building of the pondok facility done primarily
   by professional carpenters helped by OFI staff, the construction of the
   playground began. This was an OCCQ team effort involving many staff
   members from the Care Center. Following the delivery of raw materials
   from Pangkalan Bun, staff carried the wood, winding down a narrow
   pathway, to the site of the new pondok facility nestled within the
   forest of the Care Center. This journey gave some staff the opportunity
   to show off how strong they were and how much wood they could carry at
   once!

   Next, some experienced hands stepped in to initiate construction, led
   by resident OCCQ carpenters Pak Masri and Pak Sehat.  A roof and many
   posts made up the structural shell of the playground…machetes at the
   ready!   Whatever the task at the Care Center, about five people seemed
   to appear out of thin air ready to help and offer their “two cents.”
   Many discussions were had about where the posts should be placed.  In
   the meantime, wood was beginning to run out. Placing another order of
   ironwood from Pangkalan Bun could take weeks.

   Days were long and hot, but spirits were high, helped by jokes and iced
   tea. Sawing the wood and hammering the pieces together on the ground,
   the roof was partially constructed and then carried into position by
   Pak Tumin and others.  Just like their orangutan charges, many OFI
   staff members who grew up around Pasir Panjang are no strangers to the
   forest.  They display impressive climbing skills where others would
   struggle. All Pak Ateng needed was two beams of wood, and he could
   scramble up to the top to help lift the roof in place!

   With the shell in place, the Enrichment Team stepped in to fill in the
   details. With their combined experience building other playgrounds over
   the years, this playground was sure to have the latest enrichment
   features. Rope ladders were made from scratch with wood and rope,
   drilled to spec, and hung from various spots. Blue barrels were
   installed for the orangutans to use for playing, hiding, and building
   nests within. Tires were suspended from the ceiling. Constructing and
   installing all the pieces was time-consuming, detailed work, but many
   hands made for light work, and the effort paid off once the orangutans
   tested out the facilities!

   When the orangutans finally came in, they seemed to enjoy their new
   playground with great gusto! Orangutan Hayes liked it so much that he
   decided to split his time between the Learning Forest and the
   playground, but not without bringing some of the forest back with him
   into the playground, yanking branches from adjacent trees. With eight
   blue barrels to choose from, Orangutan Jangkis gravitated toward those
   that were centrally located. Orangutan Ponti enjoyed hanging from the
   roof, probably relishing the comforting safety of being high up in the
   rafters.  As they continue to hone their forest skills, the orangutans
   utilize the playground when and how they want, but there are always
   some who bypass the playground entirely to head straight out for the
   Learning Forest.


   Once a mass of wood and nails, the playground took just over a month to
   complete, thanks to the hard work and dedication of staff from all
   corners of the Care Center.  It stands ready for the orangutans to use
   as they continue on their path to freedom in the wild. Special thanks
   are owed to OFI Canada and Youssef-Warren Foundation who made the
   construction of this new pondok and playground possible as well as
   other donors who continue to support the ongoing process of
   rehabilitating these growing great apes!
