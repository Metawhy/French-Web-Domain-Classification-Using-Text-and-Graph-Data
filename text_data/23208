   Mauricio Pochettino is already planning to make transfers in January
   after Tottenham were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Sky Bet League
   Two club Colchester United.

   After 90 goalless minutes, the U's took another Premier League scalp,
   having eliminated Crystal Palace in the second round, as Tom Lapslie
   hit the winning spot-kick after Christian Eriksen and Lucas Moura
   missed in the shootout.

   Pochettino, who has yet to win a trophy since taking over in 2014,
   spoke publicly early this season about agitation in the squad and his
   concerns about team spirit, with Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen among the
   senior players to have been left out for big matches.

   Spurs produced a disjointed display that was in keeping with the start
   they have made to the Premier League season, and Pochettino said: "We
   are working so hard to put everyone on the same page.

   "Only we need time. January is going to be a good opportunity too to
   fix this situation and the next one. That is the problem when something
   happens that you cannot control.

   "It means we are human and in football to keep the successful period in
   football you need to be different every season and find different
   solutions. We need to do something different and we will do that.

   "We lost the game by penalties and today was about winning. When you
   play at this stage, it's not about the performance but the result.

   "That's the beauty of the competition, always something can happen. We
   wanted to go further but we are out.

   "When you have an unsettled squad always it's difficult and you lose
   time and then you need time to recover the time you lose. That's where
   we are.

Tottenham's shock exit in stats

   Colchester become the first team from outside the top flight to win a
   penalty shootout against two Premier League sides in a League Cup
   campaign since Bradford did so en route to the final in 2013.
   Tottenham meanwhile have been eliminated by a side from a lower
   division in the League Cup for the first time since 2005-06 against
   Grimsby.

   "Maybe our performances are good but you need this extra, which is
   mental, connection, it's energy to be all together, not to have
   different agendas in the squad.

   "We need time again to build that togetherness that you need when you
   are competing at this level."

Analysis: Tottenham must start winning silverware

   Tottenham must start winning trophies in order to be viewed as making
   progress under Pochettino, according to former head coach Tim Sherwood.

   "I can't believe it - Colchester are the lowest-ranked team left in the
   competition," Sherwood told The Debate. "They just couldn't get
   anything going and didn't create too many clear-cut chances.

   "I'm all for going for this competition when you haven't won anything
   for such a long period of time, and I just think it's an opportunity
   missed to get to the next stage.

   "They should've just got the job done and brought the big players off
   after. Having said that, the starting line-up should've been good
   enough to beat a League Two team anyway.

   "I thought it would be only a matter of time even without the big guns,
   but then I saw Son and Eriksen coming on, and then Erik Lamela, and I
   thought they would open them up but they got into a rut and it was very
   stale. They got very safe and there was no one taking any risks.

   "I know those fans want to win a trophy, and of course Mauricio would
   want to win one as well. It's all about winning something for these
   guys now, and we've said it many times."

   Despite making 10 changes to the side that were beaten 2-1 by Leicester
   at the King Power Stadium, there was still enough quality in the
   Tottenham side to avoid an upset.

   Sherwood added: "Mauricio has every right to look at the players who
   started tonight and ask them, 'are you really pushing to play in my
   team in the Premier League? Are you really pushing if we get to the
   Champions League this year?

   "Were you willing to be brave on the ball at Colchester? There's no
   consistency. Last week, they beat Crystal Palace in half an hour, and
   then they lost at Leicester. You never know what you're going to get.

   "He is looking for consistency, but you only get that through a
   consistent team. He's perhaps rotating too much at the moment. On the
   face of it, he knows that three players will be leaving - Eriksen, Toby
   Alderweireld and Vertonghen will be leaving for nothing which will hurt
   the club.

   "If they want to move to a bigger club than Tottenham, they have to
   perform well."

   Moussa Djenepo signs for Southampton in a deal that could rise to £15m

   Southampton have signed winger Moussa Djenepo on a four-year contract
   from Standard Liege in a deal that could rise to £15m.

   The 20-year-old passed a medical last week before joining up with Mali
   to prepare for the African Cup of Nations, with the deal rising to £15m
   due to performance-related bonuses, subject to the relevant paperwork
   being completed on 1st July.

   Djenepo scored 11 times for Standard Liege in Belgium as he helped them
   to a third-place finish in the top flight and qualification for the
   Europa League.

   Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: "We are very happy to
   welcome Moussa as the first new player to join our team ahead of the
   upcoming season.

   "He is an exciting player, with tremendous pace and good finishing
   abilities, who we have watched closely for some time.

   "We have been impressed with how he has adapted to football in Europe
   and the impact he has had in many games, and we had an interest in him
   as recently as January, so I am pleased we are able to bring him into
   the club."

   The winger is Hasenhuttl's first permanent signing since he took over
   from Mark Hughes at St Mary's in December 2018.

   Hasenhuttl added: "He combines his quality with a good mentality, and
   he is the right profile of player that we want to sign - still in the
   early part of his career, already with a lot of talent, but also with a
   great amount of potential that I believe we can help him to fulfil.

   "I think he will be an excellent fit for our style of play and shape,
   and these are the important characteristics we must look for.

   "It is about getting this right sort of quality, not quantity - we must
   maximise the use of this window by spending our money in the right way
   and on the right type of player, and this is a very strong start."

   The youngster has earned eight senior caps for his country and will
   begin his pre-season with the club after the close of the competition,
   which gets under way in late June.

   Djenepo commented: "It is something I am very proud of. It's a dream
   come true. Southampton is a great club and I am very happy.

   "It's a good club that is progressing, it has great facilities, and
   it's a place that can help me to really kick on and progress.

Wolves 2-1 Torino (5-3 on agg): Wolves reach European group stage for first
time since 1980

Raul Jimenez and Leander Dendoncker send Wolves into Europa League group
stage

   Nuno Espirito Santo says Wolves' progression into the Europa League
   group stage is 'massive' for the club
   Nuno Espirito Santo says Wolves' progression into the Europa League
   group stage is 'massive' for the club

   Raul Jimenez and Leander Dendoncker fired Wolves into the Europa League
   group stage after a 2-1 win over Torino.

   Striker Jimenez struck his sixth goal in six European games to help
   send the hosts through 5-3 on aggregate in their play-off.

   Andrea Belotti briefly levelled in the second half before Dendocker
   struck to cap victory at Molineux.

   Nuno Espirito Santo's side now wait for Friday's main draw in Monaco
   after battling through the qualifying rounds to extend their first
   European campaign since 1980.

   Torino rarely looked like turning around a 3-2 first-leg deficit
   despite plenty of possession. They tried to force the early running and
   Daniele Baselli volleyed well wide from the edge of the box.

   Diogo Jota came in for heavy treatment from the Italians, who were
   snappy without following any of their early intent through.

   The Serie A side were restricted to long-range efforts and, when a
   well-worked free-kick was only half cleared, Tomas Rincon thundered a
   volley wide.

   Molineux was nervous and Wolves' sloppy distribution failed to ease the
   tension as Torino dominated the ball.

   The hosts did, at least, create the first serious chance after 25
   minutes only for Adama Traore to waste the opening.

   The winger's 50-yard run sent him powering into the area but, with just
   Salvatore Sirigu to beat, he fired at the goalkeeper from an angle.

   It woke Wolves up, but it was still a surprise when they look the lead
   after half an hour. Traore was granted space on the right and, when he
   delivered a low cross, Jimenez got across Temitayo Aina to poke in at
   the near post.

   It was his seventh goal of the season, with the £32m striker justifying
   his summer price tag.

   With a two-goal advantage on aggregate Wolves finally settled but still
   needed Rui Patricio to gather Simone Zaza's free header.

   Needing three goals to win Torino's hopes were fading but Patricio had
   to be alert to turn Baselli's angled free-kick behind five minutes
   after the break.

   Yet the goalkeeper was beaten in the 58th minute when Belotti glanced
   in Baselli's whipped delivery from six yards. Wolves hit back, though,
   to restore their advantage just 103 seconds later.

   Jota scampered into the area and, when Sirigu saved his shot,
   Dendoncker fired in off a post from 16 yards.

   It wrapped up the tie but Dendoncker should have grabbed a second with
   five minutes left only to shoot too close to Sirigu.

   Soualiho Meite could have then levelled on the night soon after but
   shot wide with just Patricio to beat.

   Mauricio Pochettino is already planning to make transfers in January
   after Tottenham were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Sky Bet League
   Two club Colchester United.

   After 90 goalless minutes, the U's took another Premier League scalp,
   having eliminated Crystal Palace in the second round, as Tom Lapslie
   hit the winning spot-kick after Christian Eriksen and Lucas Moura
   missed in the shootout.

   Pochettino, who has yet to win a trophy since taking over in 2014,
   spoke publicly early this season about agitation in the squad and his
   concerns about team spirit, with Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen among the
   senior players to have been left out for big matches.

   Spurs produced a disjointed display that was in keeping with the start
   they have made to the Premier League season, and Pochettino said: "We
   are working so hard to put everyone on the same page.

   "Only we need time. January is going to be a good opportunity too to
   fix this situation and the next one. That is the problem when something
   happens that you cannot control.

   "It means we are human and in football to keep the successful period in
   football you need to be different every season and find different
   solutions. We need to do something different and we will do that.

   "We lost the game by penalties and today was about winning. When you
   play at this stage, it's not about the performance but the result.

   "That's the beauty of the competition, always something can happen. We
   wanted to go further but we are out.

   "When you have an unsettled squad always it's difficult and you lose
   time and then you need time to recover the time you lose. That's where
   we are.

Tottenham's shock exit in stats

   Colchester become the first team from outside the top flight to win a
   penalty shootout against two Premier League sides in a League Cup
   campaign since Bradford did so en route to the final in 2013.
   Tottenham meanwhile have been eliminated by a side from a lower
   division in the League Cup for the first time since 2005-06 against
   Grimsby.

   "Maybe our performances are good but you need this extra, which is
   mental, connection, it's energy to be all together, not to have
   different agendas in the squad.

   "We need time again to build that togetherness that you need when you
   are competing at this level."

Analysis: Tottenham must start winning silverware

   Tottenham must start winning trophies in order to be viewed as making
   progress under Pochettino, according to former head coach Tim Sherwood.

   "I can't believe it - Colchester are the lowest-ranked team left in the
   competition," Sherwood told The Debate. "They just couldn't get
   anything going and didn't create too many clear-cut chances.

   "I'm all for going for this competition when you haven't won anything
   for such a long period of time, and I just think it's an opportunity
   missed to get to the next stage.

   "They should've just got the job done and brought the big players off
   after. Having said that, the starting line-up should've been good
   enough to beat a League Two team anyway.

   "I thought it would be only a matter of time even without the big guns,
   but then I saw Son and Eriksen coming on, and then Erik Lamela, and I
   thought they would open them up but they got into a rut and it was very
   stale. They got very safe and there was no one taking any risks.

   "I know those fans want to win a trophy, and of course Mauricio would
   want to win one as well. It's all about winning something for these
   guys now, and we've said it many times."

   Despite making 10 changes to the side that were beaten 2-1 by Leicester
   at the King Power Stadium, there was still enough quality in the
   Tottenham side to avoid an upset.

   Sherwood added: "Mauricio has every right to look at the players who
   started tonight and ask them, 'are you really pushing to play in my
   team in the Premier League? Are you really pushing if we get to the
   Champions League this year?

   "Were you willing to be brave on the ball at Colchester? There's no
   consistency. Last week, they beat Crystal Palace in half an hour, and
   then they lost at Leicester. You never know what you're going to get.

   "He is looking for consistency, but you only get that through a
   consistent team. He's perhaps rotating too much at the moment. On the
   face of it, he knows that three players will be leaving - Eriksen, Toby
   Alderweireld and Vertonghen will be leaving for nothing which will hurt
   the club.

   "If they want to move to a bigger club than Tottenham, they have to
   perform well."

   Moussa Djenepo signs for Southampton in a deal that could rise to £15m

   Southampton have signed winger Moussa Djenepo on a four-year contract
   from Standard Liege in a deal that could rise to £15m.

   The 20-year-old passed a medical last week before joining up with Mali
   to prepare for the African Cup of Nations, with the deal rising to £15m
   due to performance-related bonuses, subject to the relevant paperwork
   being completed on 1st July.

   Djenepo scored 11 times for Standard Liege in Belgium as he helped them
   to a third-place finish in the top flight and qualification for the
   Europa League.

   Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: "We are very happy to
   welcome Moussa as the first new player to join our team ahead of the
   upcoming season.

   "He is an exciting player, with tremendous pace and good finishing
   abilities, who we have watched closely for some time.

   "We have been impressed with how he has adapted to football in Europe
   and the impact he has had in many games, and we had an interest in him
   as recently as January, so I am pleased we are able to bring him into
   the club."

   The winger is Hasenhuttl's first permanent signing since he took over
   from Mark Hughes at St Mary's in December 2018.

   Hasenhuttl added: "He combines his quality with a good mentality, and
   he is the right profile of player that we want to sign - still in the
   early part of his career, already with a lot of talent, but also with a
   great amount of potential that I believe we can help him to fulfil.

   "I think he will be an excellent fit for our style of play and shape,
   and these are the important characteristics we must look for.

   "It is about getting this right sort of quality, not quantity - we must
   maximise the use of this window by spending our money in the right way
   and on the right type of player, and this is a very strong start."

   The youngster has earned eight senior caps for his country and will
   begin his pre-season with the club after the close of the competition,
   which gets under way in late June.

   Djenepo commented: "It is something I am very proud of. It's a dream
   come true. Southampton is a great club and I am very happy.

   "It's a good club that is progressing, it has great facilities, and
   it's a place that can help me to really kick on and progress.

Wolves 2-1 Torino (5-3 on agg): Wolves reach European group stage for first
time since 1980

Raul Jimenez and Leander Dendoncker send Wolves into Europa League group
stage

   Nuno Espirito Santo says Wolves' progression into the Europa League
   group stage is 'massive' for the club
   Nuno Espirito Santo says Wolves' progression into the Europa League
   group stage is 'massive' for the club

   Raul Jimenez and Leander Dendoncker fired Wolves into the Europa League
   group stage after a 2-1 win over Torino.

   Striker Jimenez struck his sixth goal in six European games to help
   send the hosts through 5-3 on aggregate in their play-off.

   Andrea Belotti briefly levelled in the second half before Dendocker
   struck to cap victory at Molineux.

   Nuno Espirito Santo's side now wait for Friday's main draw in Monaco
   after battling through the qualifying rounds to extend their first
   European campaign since 1980.

   Torino rarely looked like turning around a 3-2 first-leg deficit
   despite plenty of possession. They tried to force the early running and
   Daniele Baselli volleyed well wide from the edge of the box.

   Diogo Jota came in for heavy treatment from the Italians, who were
   snappy without following any of their early intent through.

   The Serie A side were restricted to long-range efforts and, when a
   well-worked free-kick was only half cleared, Tomas Rincon thundered a
   volley wide.

   Molineux was nervous and Wolves' sloppy distribution failed to ease the
   tension as Torino dominated the ball.

   The hosts did, at least, create the first serious chance after 25
   minutes only for Adama Traore to waste the opening.

   The winger's 50-yard run sent him powering into the area but, with just
   Salvatore Sirigu to beat, he fired at the goalkeeper from an angle.

   It woke Wolves up, but it was still a surprise when they look the lead
   after half an hour. Traore was granted space on the right and, when he
   delivered a low cross, Jimenez got across Temitayo Aina to poke in at
   the near post.

   It was his seventh goal of the season, with the £32m striker justifying
   his summer price tag.

   With a two-goal advantage on aggregate Wolves finally settled but still
   needed Rui Patricio to gather Simone Zaza's free header.

   Needing three goals to win Torino's hopes were fading but Patricio had
   to be alert to turn Baselli's angled free-kick behind five minutes
   after the break.

   Yet the goalkeeper was beaten in the 58th minute when Belotti glanced
   in Baselli's whipped delivery from six yards. Wolves hit back, though,
   to restore their advantage just 103 seconds later.

   Jota scampered into the area and, when Sirigu saved his shot,
   Dendoncker fired in off a post from 16 yards.

   It wrapped up the tie but Dendoncker should have grabbed a second with
   five minutes left only to shoot too close to Sirigu.

   Soualiho Meite could have then levelled on the night soon after but
   shot wide with just Patricio to beat.

Rachid Ghezzal: Leicester City winger in talks with Olympiakos

   Rachid Ghezzal has not featured for Leicester so far this season

   Greek side Olympiakos are in negotiations with Leicester to sign their
   Algerian right-winger Rachid Ghezzal.

   The 27-year-old was signed by former Foxes boss Claude Puel for £12.5m
   from AS Monaco a year ago.

   Olympiakos are eager to agree a deal ahead of the Super League Greece
   transfer deadline on August 31.

   Ghezzal scored three goals in 23 appearances in all competitions during
   the 2018/19 campaign but is yet to feature in Brendan Rodgers' plans so
   far this season.

   The Algeria international has three years remaining on his current
   Leicester deal after agreeing a four-year contract when he arrived in
   2018.

   Ghezzal would be the eighth player to move away from the King Power
   Stadium this summer if he joins Olympiakos.

   Adrien Silva and Islam Slimani recently joined Ghezzal's former club
   Monaco on season-long loan deals.

   Harry Maguire joined Manchester United for £80m in a world-record
   transfer for a defender before the English transfer deadline.

When does the transfer window close?

   Thought the transfer window was closed? Wrong. Across Europe, plenty of
   deals are still being done, with Premier League players still able to
   move to the continent.

   also do deals until September 2.

   Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino calls for patience after their shock
   exit to Colchester in the third round of the Carabao Cup

   Mauricio Pochettino is already planning to make transfers in January
   after Tottenham were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Sky Bet League
   Two club Colchester United.

   After 90 goalless minutes, the U's took another Premier League scalp,
   having eliminated Crystal Palace in the second round, as Tom Lapslie
   hit the winning spot-kick after Christian Eriksen and Lucas Moura
   missed in the shootout.

   Pochettino, who has yet to win a trophy since taking over in 2014,
   spoke publicly early this season about agitation in the squad and his
   concerns about team spirit, with Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen among the
   senior players to have been left out for big matches.

   United and Tottenham

   Spurs produced a disjointed display that was in keeping with the start
   they have made to the Premier League season, and Pochettino said: "We
   are working so hard to put everyone on the same page.

   "Only we need time. January is going to be a good opportunity too to
   fix this situation and the next one. That is the problem when something
   happens that you cannot control.

   "It means we are human and in football to keep the successful period in
   football you need to be different every season and find different
   solutions. We need to do something different and we will do that.

   "We lost the game by penalties and today was about winning. When you
   play at this stage, it's not about the performance but the result.

   "That's the beauty of the competition, always something can happen. We
   wanted to go further but we are out.

   "When you have an unsettled squad always it's difficult and you lose
   time and then you need time to recover the time you lose. That's where
   we are.

Tottenham's shock exit in stats

   Colchester become the first team from outside the top flight to win a
   penalty shootout against two Premier League sides in a League Cup
   campaign since Bradford did so en route to the final in 2013.
   Tottenham meanwhile have been eliminated by a side from a lower
   division in the League Cup for the first time since 2005-06 against
   Grimsby.

   "Maybe our performances are good but you need this extra, which is
   mental, connection, it's energy to be all together, not to have
   different agendas in the squad.

   "We need time again to build that togetherness that you need when you
   are competing at this level."

Analysis: Tottenham must start winning silverware

   Tottenham must start winning trophies in order to be viewed as making
   progress under Pochettino, according to former head coach Tim Sherwood.

   "I can't believe it - Colchester are the lowest-ranked team left in the
   competition," Sherwood told The Debate. "They just couldn't get
   anything going and didn't create too many clear-cut chances.
   Tim Sherwood says Mauricio Pochettino’s side produced a stale
   performance as Colchester knocked them out of the Carabao Cup on
   penalties

   "I'm all for going for this competition when you haven't won anything
   for such a long period of time, and I just think it's an opportunity
   missed to get to the next stage.

   "They should've just got the job done and brought the big players off
   after. Having said that, the starting line-up should've been good
   enough to beat a League Two team anyway.

   "I thought it would be only a matter of time even without the big guns,
   but then I saw Son and Eriksen coming on, and then Erik Lamela, and I
   thought they would open them up but they got into a rut and it was very
   stale. They got very safe and there was no one taking any risks.

   "I know those fans want to win a trophy, and of course Mauricio would
   want to win one as well. It's all about winning something for these
   guys now, and we've said it many times."

   Despite making 10 changes to the side that were beaten 2-1 by Leicester
   at the King Power Stadium, there was still enough quality in the
   Tottenham side to avoid an upset.

   Sherwood added: "Mauricio has every right to look at the players who
   started tonight and ask them, 'are you really pushing to play in my
   team in the Premier League? Are you really pushing if we get to the
   Champions League this year?

   "Were you willing to be brave on the ball at Colchester? There's no
   consistency. Last week, they beat Crystal Palace in half an hour, and
   then they lost at Leicester. You never know what you're going to get.

   "He is looking for consistency, but you only get that through a
   consistent team. He's perhaps rotating too much at the moment. On the
   face of it, he knows that three players will be leaving - Eriksen, Toby
   Alderweireld and Vertonghen will be leaving for nothing which will hurt
   the club.

   "If they want to move to a bigger club than Tottenham, they have to
   perform well."

Southampton sign winger Moussa Djenepo from Standard Liege in £15m move

   14:00, UK, Thursday 13 June 2019

   to £15m

   Southampton have signed winger Moussa Djenepo on a four-year contract
   from Standard Liege in a deal that could rise to £15m.

   The 20-year-old passed a medical last week before joining up with Mali
   to prepare for the African Cup of Nations, with the deal rising to £15m
   due to performance-related bonuses, subject to the relevant paperwork
   being completed on 1st July.

   Djenepo scored 11 times for Standard Liege in Belgium as he helped them
   to a third-place finish in the top flight and qualification for the
   Europa League.

   Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: "We are very happy to
   welcome Moussa as the first new player to join our team ahead of the
   upcoming season.

   "He is an exciting player, with tremendous pace and good finishing
   abilities, who we have watched closely for some time.

   "We have been impressed with how he has adapted to football in Europe
   and the impact he has had in many games, and we had an interest in him
   as recently as January, so I am pleased we are able to bring him into
   the club."

   The winger is Hasenhuttl's first permanent signing since he took over
   from Mark Hughes at St Mary's in December 2018.

Saints set to sign Djenepo from Liege

   Liege this season

   Hasenhuttl added: "He combines his quality with a good mentality, and
   he is the right profile of player that we want to sign - still in the
   early part of his career, already with a lot of talent, but also with a
   great amount of potential that I believe we can help him to fulfil.

   "I think he will be an excellent fit for our style of play and shape,
   and these are the important characteristics we must look for.

   "It is about getting this right sort of quality, not quantity - we must
   maximise the use of this window by spending our money in the right way
   and on the right type of player, and this is a very strong start."

   The youngster has earned eight senior caps for his country and will
   begin his pre-season with the club after the close of the competition,
   which gets under way in late June.

   Djenepo commented: "It is something I am very proud of. It's a dream
   come true. Southampton is a great club and I am very happy.

   "It's a good club that is progressing, it has great facilities, and
   it's a place that can help me to really kick on and progress.

   "I am looking forward to it and I want to get to know my new family. I
   can't wait to be around my new teammates and work hard alongside them."
