10 Wedding Script Fonts (That Haven't Been Done to Death)

   I used to do "Font Junkie Fridays" here at Pretty Little Palace. I've
   decide to change it to Font Junkie Whenever I Feel Like It(s),
   because.....I am a font junkie. It's too hard to schedule my love. :D
   Today I want to share some fresh wedding script ideas for my fellow
   crafty ladies and gentlemen who plan to design their own wedding
   stationery.  I went the DIY route and am totally thrilled with how my
   invitations came out - I'm working on another post all about them for
   later this week.
   When I was designing my wedding invitations, I probably plugged
   "wedding fonts" into the ol' Google machine about 342,596 times. The
   same fonts came up over and over and over.  So today I present to you
   10 lovely wedding scripts that haven't been done to death.
   Scroll down to find the name of each font along with a link to download
   and/or purchase it.
   [10%2Bwedding%2Bfonts.008.png]
   1. Ariadne Script
   2. Melany Lane
   3. Monalisa Script
   4. AlaNice
   5. Hollyhock
   6. Veryberry
   7. Fameliya
   8. Rushistly
   9. Isabella
   10. Janda Stylish Script
   The beautiful watercolor graphics in the image come from Angie Makes.

HOLY HOMELAND

   HOLY HOMELAND.
   This season is ON POINT. I did not intend for this blog to be a place
   for me to talk about Homeland, but last night's episode has me feeling
   all the feels.
   I'm not going to recap the episode, because I am too busy feeling all
   the feels, but holy Homeland. The entire episode was this slow build of
   white-knuckle tension, culminating in that quietly baller scene in the
   car where we see a lifetime's worth of emotion rushing through Saul as
   he basically decides, yet again, whether to live or die. He goes from
   broken to badass in one swift motion, putting on his glasses and
   cheerily greeting Mira on the phone. It was just this crazy powerful
   moment that I had to process carefully and -
   NEVER MIND. RPG.
   NEVER MIND AGAIN. SECOND RPG.
   Well played, Homeland. You took a year off my life. Well played.
   Ok, one more side note on episode 9: Just as I was telling my husband
   that the Ambassador was going to need to stop being such a bonehead
   pretty soon, she busts into the conference room and we realize she was
   playing Dennis the whole time. Well played, Martha. Well played.
   Naturally, I can not handle waiting two weeks for the next episode. TWO
   WEEKS. That's just mean. I get that next Sunday is Thanksgiving
   weekend, but I am not thankful for that.
   I scoured the interwebs for hints about what happens next - and found
   this video from Showtime with a clip from Episode 10, "A Diversion".

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/_1kpSckrAmI

   OK. It's a start. I'll take it. For anyone who doesn't have 48 seconds
   to watch the video, I've taken the liberty of summarizing what happens.
   See picture below:
   [homeland.001.png]
   So yeah, that's what we know. THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS LEFT
   UNANSWERED.
   Does Carrie die?
   Probably not, let's be serious. And dear lord. Girl. Can. Act. This
   episode showed Carrie AND Claire Danes at both of their personal bests.
   Does Saul die?
   50-50. On one hand, it's Saul. Mandy Patinkin needs to get an Oscar for
   his performance on the tarmac. I am 100% aware that Oscars are for
   movies. THAT'S HOW GOOD HE WAS. He should just get every award ever
   made - Oscar, Emmy, Tony, People's Choice Award, MTV Video of the Year,
   Little League MVP, just give him everything.
   On the other hand, killing Saul after all of that hubbub, after
   unleashing 5 terrifying terrorists back into the world? That would be a
   classic Homeland move if ever there was one. 50-50.
   Does John Redmond die?
   Almost guaranteed.
   Will Asar Khan die?
   Ugh, I do not feel confident about his survival probability now that
   Tasneem is clearly onto him. But I'm pulling for him.
   Does Quinn save the embassy with his ragtag gang of boneheads?
   Maybe. If anyone can do it, Quinn can. But maybe not, because if anyone
   can end an episode with a successful Taliban takeover of a U.S.
   embassy, it's Homeland's writers. Exhibit A: Langley bombing.
   Will Homeland continue to not blow it by backing off the love stories?
   Hopefully. I mean, early in the season, they were reallllllly pushing
   this whole Quinn-is-hopelessly-in-love-with-Carrie angle, that
   honestly, NO ONE CARES ABOUT. Hopefully, the raucous applause from the
   last two episodes, which had nothing to do with this fabricated plot
   line, will prove that viewers appreciate this show even more when they
   aren't forcing a romance between the last two age-appropriate American
   characters still alive.
   Quote of the episode:
   This is a tie between Lockhart's expletive-riddled reaction to the
   RPGs, effectively verbalizing what ALL of us are thinking and this gem
   from my husband:

     "This terrorist is hard to take seriously because he looks so much
     like Dennis Feinstein, Fragrance Maker." -Husband #homeland
     — Blair Turner (@blairkturner) November 24, 2014

   The only thing missing from this season is a member of the Brody
   family.
   HA! Oh man, I KID.

Free Wallpaper Organizers to Tame the Desktop Beast

   [title.003.png]
   I just got a new computer (yay!) and I had to make a solemn promise to
   myself:
   I, Blair Turner, vow to treat my new desktop with the respect it
   deserves. I will not litter it with 3,256 screenshots I cannot remember
   why I needed to take. I will not use it as a dumping ground for the
   48,927 PDF documents I do not feel like filing. I will keep it clean. I
   will keep it organized. I will TAME THE DESKTOP BEAST.
   I am not an organized person. In fact, it would not be out of line to
   say I am forever teetering on the edge of hot mess status. I knew I
   would need a little help in order to keep my promise. So, I created
   these desktop organizers to [DEL: force :DEL] remind myself to help me
   reign in the crazy that is my typical organizational strategy. Note to
   self: Keep it together, woman.
   HUGE IMPROVEMENT.
   [styled.001.png]
   [styled.002.png]
   I am sharing them with anyone else who needs to tame the beast. There
   are a few different options for each style - pre-labeled, blank with 4
   sections, and blank with 8 sections.
   [blog%2Bpost%2Bimages%2Bvertical%2Blong.001.png]
   [blog%2Bpost%2Bimages%2Bvertical%2Blong.002.png]
   Each background is available in 3 different sizes to fit almost any
   computer. Inside the zip file, you can find detailed instructions on
   how to choose the right size, edit the blank versions, and upload the
   images as your new desktop background.
   Grab these FREEBIES by {clicking here}!
   On my Instagram account, I've been posting a couple of "sneak peek"
   pictures of my latest project. I am working on a line of paper goods
   that I am SO EXCITED about.
   These desktop organizers are designed to coordinate with a couple of my
   favorite items! EEK! I am in the final stages of getting the new
   goodies ready to post for sale and ship, and hope to have them
   available in my Teachers Pay Teachers store and on Etsy in the next
   several weeks. Make sure to follow me here, or on any of my social
   media pages, so you can be the first to know when they are ready.
   {Stay tuned on Bloglovin, Facebook, Instagram, or TpT.}

   Another sneak peek! This is one of my daily notepad designs. 😍

   which you can find at www.BlairTurner.com. But EVERYONE can use a
   little organization in their life, so I hope you enjoy these freebies!

Pretty Little Printables: Entrepreneur Life

   I came across this quote today and all I could think was YES. Yes. It
   is so true. Working for myself is an adventure and I am loving every
   minute - but I have never worked harder in my life. When your "office"
   is your living room, it's a challenge to ever stop working. I'm
   definitely still working on finding the right balance (especially since
   I am still teaching part-time!), but it is so rewarding to build
   something and see it come to life all around you. I'm definitely really
   grateful to have the opportunity to chart my own path.
