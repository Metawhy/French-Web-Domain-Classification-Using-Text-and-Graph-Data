HOW DRAFTS WORKS

   CAPTURE EVERYWHERE: Drafts opens to a new page with the keyboard ready
   so you can type immediately. Go hands-free with Dictation, or ask Siri
   to “Create a note using Drafts”. Drafts lets you get things down before
   you forget – no choosing document templates or waiting for your file to
   download.

   USE YOUR WORDS: Drafts is a launching-off point for text – use the
   actions to copy it, share it, or deep link into other apps and
   services. Compose a tweet or message, create a file in Dropbox, send a
   task off to Reminders – there are hooks into tons of your favorite
   apps.

   REMEMBER IT NOW – OR LATER: New entries go into the Inbox. Once there,
   you can Tag them for organization, Flag them for importance, or Archive
   them for long-term storage.

   TAKE TEXT TO A NEW LEVEL: Set up a text editing experience that’s
   perfect for you, with tons of interface adjustments like custom fonts
   and control over spacing, line height, and margins. Use the
   customizable extended row above the keyboard to quickly convert,
   manipulate, and transform your writing. Make lists, use Markdown to get
   things just right. Process your drafts quickly using unique features
   like Link Mode, Arrange Mode, and Focus Mode.

WHY YOU’LL LOVE DRAFTS

   IT WILL CHANGE HOW YOU USE YOUR DEVICES: Drafts gives you a new
   approach to using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, letting you write
   first and think about what to do with it later. Try it in your dock for
   a week, you’ll find you can’t live without it.

   GETTING WORDS DOWN HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER: Drafts opens lightning fast
   and with support for capture via Siri, the widget, share extension,
   file import, and dictation - Drafts is like post-its updated for the
   smartphone era.

   POWERFUL ACTIONS: Actions make Drafts a Swiss Army knife for text.
   Integrate with a bewildering array of apps and services.
