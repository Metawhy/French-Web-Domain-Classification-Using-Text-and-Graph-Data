CASA Team

   CASA is a research group of laboratory IRISA, Université Bretagne Sud.

Overview

   The research activity of team CASA aims at supporting communication and
   service provision in challenged environments, and most notably in
   partially or intermittently connected mobile networks. We mostly focus
   on mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and investigate how the DTN
   (Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking) approach can help support
   communication and services when such networks are disconnected.

   Part of our activity consists in designing opportunistic routing
   protocols for disconnected MANETs (D-MANETs), and implementing these
   protocols in communication middleware so they can be tested in real
   conditions.

   Additionally, we investigate how distributed applications can be
   designed and implemented for networks whose characteristics keep
   changing spontaneously and unpredictably. The term Opportunistic
   Computing has been introduced recently in the literature in order to
   refer to a new computing paradigm that relies exclusively on pairwise
   contacts bewteen mobile hosts. Team CASA strives to contribute to the
   development of this computing paradigm by designing methods, models,
   and middleware tools that make it easier for programmers to tackle the
   challenges presented by application development for D-MANETs.

ADAM: Agreement in Disconnected Ad hoc Mobile networks

   ADAM (Agreement in Disconnected Ad hoc Mobile networks) is an open
   source consensus implementation specifically designed for the the
   context of D-MANETs. ADAM is based on a variant of the One-Third-Rule
   Heard-Of algorithm, extending it with DoDWAN.

Pre-Requirements

   Before start using ADAM, DoDWAN is required to be installed and
   configured on hosts. For installing DoDWAN, please refer here.

Getting started

   Here, I will present a code example demonstrating how to write a
   consensus application for D-MANETs. It is intended to be the quickest
   path to the consensus experience in such networks.
//Step 1: Import the required Packages
import casa.consensus.consensusImpl.*;
import participantTable.*;
import nodes.ConsensusNode;

//Step 2: Create a ConsensusFactory. In general, consensus applications begin al
l by looking up an instance of this class
ConsensusFactory cFactory=new ConsensusFactory();

//Step 3: Now you can start using the ConnectionFactory instance to create Sessi
on and ConsensusNode instances
// Session
Session session=cFactory.createSession(...);
// ConsensusNode
ConsensusNode node=cFactory.createConsensusNode(...);

//Step 4: Start the Session
session.start(...);

//Step 5: Sending Votes
node.voting(...);

//Step 6: Send the Decision
node.decide(...);

//Step 7: A ParticipantTable instance can be initialized as follows
ParticipantTable pTable=ParticipantTableSingleton.getInstance();

//Step 8: The ParticipantTable can be used to lookup/list known ConsensusNode(s)
//lookup a consensus node
ConsensusNode node = pTable.lookup(...);
//list consensus nodes
Collection nodes = pTable.list(...);

                                                                    Top…

The Console

   You want to test ADAM in real conditions but you do not want to burn
   yourself out writing too many applications. Okay, here is the solution.
   I offer you an interactive tools, called Console. This console provides
   you with the most commonly commands, i.e., create
   Sessions/ConsensusNodes, start/list Sessions, send Votes/Decides and
   the ParticipantTable commands. The console’s source code is available
   at consensusImpl/console directory.

   You can check the scenario in the following figure: there are four
   devices, named here A, B, C and D. All of these hosts are
   well-configured. And now, the following steps describe how to run the
   Console in the this scenario:

                                Web Template

   Step 1: Launch the console on A, B, C and D
java -cp consensusimpl-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar casa.consensus.consensusI
mpl.console.TCPConsole

   Step 2: Access to the console on A, B, C and D
// The port number could be changed using the configuration file
telnet localhost 8800

   Congratulation! you can now use it. The following examples demonstrate
   how to use some of the console commands:

   To see the full list of console’s commands on any device, type:
co help

   On any device, in order to declare itself as a consensus node type:
co node

   On the device A, to create a session named “election_A” in which all
   the known consensus nodes can participate (i.e., A,B,C and D) type:
co start election_A

   On the device B, in order to participate in the session “election_A”
   and vote “B”, type:
co vote election_A B

   On the device C, in order to list the sessions in which it can
   participate, type:
co list

   On the device D, in order to list all the consensus nodes that it knows
   about (i.e., list the entries of the ParticipantTable)
co participant

                                                                    Top…
