Announcing the launch of In Review

   BMC Bioinformatics, in partnership with Research Square, is now
   offering In Review. Authors choosing this free optional service will be
   able to:
     * Share their work with fellow researchers to read, comment on, and
       cite even before publication
     * Showcase their work to funders and others with a citable DOI while
       it is still under review
     * Track their manuscript - including seeing when reviewers are
       invited, and when reports are received
