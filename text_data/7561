   Via Carota is the West Village gastroteca of cherished downtown chefs
   Jody Williams and Rita Sodi.  Inspired by the 17th-century villa in the
   hills near Florence which Sodi once called home, Via Carota honors
   old-world Italian roots, life style, food and décor.

   Their Village gastroteca is thoughtfully renovated: wooden floors
   reclaimed from an old gymnasium, vintage chapel chairs from England and
   rustic wooden cabinets filled with heirloom china. Servers wear crisp
   white shirts and long linen aprons, there are communal tables and even
   a private room tucked away amongst the wine bottles.  Baskets of crusty
   bread and bowls of oranges are scattered throughout the sun drenched
   space. For bel tempo pleasure there are eight outdoor tables on the
   tree-lined sidewalk.

   Located at 51 Grove Street in the West Village; Via Carota is just one
   block up from the couple’s other beloved restaurants Buvette and I
   Sodi.  Via Carota is open all day long serving food and drink, early
   until late in a true gastroteca fashion.
