   Parallel Challenges   [new.gif]

   CONVECS is a research project-team common between Inria Grenoble -
   Rhône-Alpes and the LIG laboratory. Its research activities focus on
   the formal modeling and verification of asynchronous concurrent
   systems, which are instantiated in various domains (communication
   protocols, distributed algorithms, GALS, etc.). To this aim, CONVECS
   proposes new formal languages for specifying the behaviour and the
   properties of concurrent systems, and devises efficient verification
   algorithms and tools running on sequential and massively parallel
   machines.

   CONVECS builds on the scientific expertise and human potential of the
   former VASY project-team of Inria.
