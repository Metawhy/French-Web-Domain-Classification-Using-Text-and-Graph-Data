   BE GUIDED BY HOPES AND DETERMINATION, BE GUIDED BY IDEALS, AND, YES, BE
   GUIDED BY DREAMS !
   (Soekarno, Opening Speech, The Asian-African Conference, Bandung,
   Indonesia, April 18, 1955)

   CALL FOR PAPERS FOR SPECIAL SESSIONS DEDICATED TO THE FOLLOWING AREAS
   IN RELATION WITH THE RISE OF ASIA (ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENDED TO
   OCTOBER 31, 2019)
   It is a new departure in the history of the world that leaders of Asian
   and African peoples can meet together in their own countries to discuss
   and deliberate upon matters of common concern.
   […]
   For many generations our peoples have been the voiceless ones in the
   world. We have been the unregarded, the peoples for whom decisions were
   made by others whose interests were paramount, the peoples who lived in
   poverty and humiliation. Then our nations demanded, nay... fought for
   independence, and achieved independence, and with that independence
   came responsibility. We have heavy responsibilities to ourselves, and
   to the world, and to the yet unborn generations.
   […]
   I recall that, several years ago, I had occasion to make a public
   analysis of colonialism, and that I then drew attention to what I
   called the "Life-line of Imperialism". This line runs from the Straits
   of Gibraltar, through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, the Red Sea,
   the Indian Ocean, the South China Sea and the Sea of Japan. For most of
   that enormous distance, the territories on both sides of this lifeline
   were colonies, the peoples were unfree, their futures mortgaged to an
   alien system. Along that life-line, that main artery of imperialism,
   there was pumped the life-blood of colonialism.
   […]
   Yes, we are living in a world of fear. The life of man today is
   corroded and made bitter by fear. Fear of the future, fear of the
   hydrogen bomb, fear of ideologies. Perhaps this fear is a greater
   danger than the danger itself, because it is fear which drives men to
   act foolishly, to act thoughtlessly, to act dangerously. In your
   deliberations, Sisters and Brothers, I beg of you, do not be guided by
   these fears, because fear is an acid which etches man’s actions into
   curious patterns. Be guided by hopes and determination, be guided by
   ideals, and, yes, be guided by dreams !
   […]
   We are often told “Colonialism is dead”. Let us not be deceived or even
   soothed by that. […] Colonialism has also its modern dress, in the form
   of economic control, intellectual control, actual physical control by a
   small but alien community within a nation. It is a skilful and
   determined enemy, and it appears in many guises. It does not give up
   its loot easily. Wherever, whenever and however it appears, colonialism
   is an evil thing, and one which must be eradicated from the earth.
   […]
   Not so long ago it was possible to take some little comfort from the
   idea that the clash, if it came, could perhaps be settled by what were
   called “conventional weapons” - bombs, tanks, cannon and men. Today
   that little grain of comfort is denied us for it has been made clear
   that the weapons of ultimate horror will certainly be used, and the
   military planning of nations is on that basis. The unconventional has
   become the conventional, and who knows what other examples of misguided
   and diabolical scientific skill have been discovered as a plague on
   humanity.
   And do not think that the oceans and the seas will protect us. The food
   that we eat, the water that we drink, yes, even the very air that we
   breathe can be contaminated by poisons originating from thousands of
   miles away. And it could be that, even if we ourselves escaped lightly,
   the unborn generations of our children would bear on their distorted
   bodies the marks of our failure to control the forces which have been
   released on the world.
   No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our
   independence means little. The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our
   countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed
   to run their course. (Soekarno, Opening Speech, The Asian-African
   Conference, Bandung, Indonesia, April 18, 1955)

   65 years after the historical 1955 Bandung Conference, is there any
   change in global order in all its dimensions (cultural, ecological,
   economical, political and spiritual dimensions) ? In what sense Bandung
   constitutes a rupture and a continuity of historical global order ? Is
   colonialism dead and decolonisation completed ? Is the position of
   centre and peripheries of capitalism stable or moving ? Does
   development means following the centre ? Did multipolarism replace
   bipolarism ? Does Bandung constitute a bifurcation in the trajectory of
   historical world system ? Is the notion of division East-West and
   North-South still relevant ? Is the notion of class struggle still
   useful ? Does the end of Cold War mean the end of potential World War ?
   Did new hegemons replace the old ones ? Why does the armament
   technology continue to develop ? Who do take benefit of the armament
   industries and trade ? What is the place of individual living being,
   human as well as animal and vegetation, in this changing world ? Is
   there any chance for the poor, the weak, the disadvantaged, to improve
   their state of being in peaceful way ? Is there any role of humanities,
   art, culture, architecture, literature, religion, spirituality in
   directing the global change ?

   A human being of four is Asian woman. It is therefore essential to
   consider women’s issues starting from Asia. What lesson we may learn
   from the men-women inequality in that region, what problems are
   appearing with intensity ? Are we in a progressive period of women’s
   status or in the contrary ? In Asia, all women do not live in the same
   space and time. What is in common between a Chinese businesswoman, a
   Japanese housewife, an Indian woman farmer, an Indonesian woman
   minister and a Vietnamese woman worker ? Those are among the questions
   to be discussed.

23/08 — UNIVERSITE D’HIVERNAGE OUAGADOUGOU 2018

   Le Réseau Bandung Spirit participe du 23 au 25 août 2018 à l’Université
   d’hivernage organisée par le Comité international Joseph Ki-Zerbo pour
   l’Afrique et la Diaspora (CIJKAD) à Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, sur le
   thème "Connaître le passé pour oser inventer l’avenir". Lazare Ki-Zerbo
   , organisateur, et Darwis Khudori, invité, seront présents.

   Quatre panels sont prévus au programme sur: "Kwame Nkrumah, Joseph
   Ki-Zerbo et Thomas Sankara: trois perspectives sur le panafricanisme";
   "Etats-Unis d’Afrique: utopie ou réalité?"; "Mémoire des mouvements de
   libération: le MLN (Mouvement de Libération nationale";
   "Panafricanisme: bilan et défis futurs".

   Cette manifestation réunira une centaine de représentants de la société
   civile, des partis politiques, des medias et du monde de la recherche.

   Elle coïncide avec le soixantième anniversaire du Manifeste du
   Mouvement de libération nationale (MLN).

   Publié le 25 août 1958 à Dakar, il avait appelé à la constitutions des
   Etats-Unis d’Afrique sous la bannière du socialisme et du neutralisme
   positif (Lazare Ki-Zerbo, Ouagadougou, le 23 août 2018)

17/08 — SAMIR AMIN HAS JUST LEFT US PHYSICALLY

   A source of fundamental references of our Bandung Spirit-based
   Academic, Social and Solidarity Movements, SAMIR AMIN, has just left us
   "physically" on August 12, 2018 - "physically" because his numerous
   works continue to guide us "intellectually" in our movements. He was
   involved in our movements since the setting-up of Bandung Spirit
   Network in 2005. See my article "Towards a Bandung spirit-based civil
   society movement: reflection from Yogyakarta commemoration of Bandung
   Asian-African Conference" (Inter-Asia Cultural Studies, Volume 7,
   Number 1, 2006). He gave an outstanding contribution to our conference
   "BANDUNG 60 YEARS ON: WHAT ASSESSMENT?" (The University Paris 1
   Panthéon-Sorbonne, June 27, 2014). His article "From Bandung (1955) to
   2015 ; Old and new challenges for the States, the Nations and the
   Peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America" helped us in framing our
   commemorative conference "BUILDING SOVEREIGNTY, PREVENTING HEGEMONY:
   The Challenges for Emerging Forces in the Globalised World"
   (Jakarta-Bandung-Jakarta, October 27-31, 2015). Here are some tributes
   written by two members of Bandung+60 Scientific Board, Ama Biney and
   Ebrima Sall (Darwis Khudori, Paris, August 17, 2018).

21/07 — BANDUNG SPIRIT BOOK SERIES

   Selected matters of the events organised in the framework of Bandung
   Spirit Network are published in the forms of printed book (for the
   proceedings or selected papers of conferences, seminars or workshops)
   and DVD (for the proceedings of arts and cultural workshops and
   festivals) under the label of respectively BANDUNG SPIRIT BOOK SERIES
   and BANDUNG SPIRIT AUDIOVISUAL SERIES.

   The last four books published with the label of BANDUNG SPIRIT BOOK
   SERIES are the followings.

   -  RETHINKING SOLIDARITY IN GLOBAL SOCIETY

   -  THE RISE OF RELIGION-BASED POLITICAL MOVEMENTS

   -  TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE ECOLOGY
