Whipped Cream Cake Roulade

                               [piegohome.jpg]

   [cream_blackberry_roll1.jpg]
   Thanks for your patience, everyone! Well, I'm more or less moved into
   my new house and I've been baking (a lot). Of course, as you can see
   I've not done so much blogging. I've had recipes to test and retest and
   I'm still getting used to my new kitchen and my new oven. No small
   adjustment either. My previous oven was a cavernous
   convection/conventional Viking professional gas oven that could fit
   full sheet pans--pans bigger than my kid's crib mattress--to a more
   ordinary Whirlpool electric.
   While I can no longer bake dozens of cookies at a time, the modest oven
   hasn't disappointed (though several recipes have). Of course, I've not
   attempted macarons in this new oven and that's a headache I'm still
   saving for later.
   So today is an absolutely gorgeous spring day in our new home town of
   Mill Creek which lies just north of Seattle. I was lucky enough to
   relocate to an area with a wicked good donut shop (Frost) and a brand
   new French Bakery (Mon Amie--yes they do macarons, go visit) that I'm
   now haunting. So before I go out and hit the garden and enjoy this
   sunshine, we're going to bake up a cake.

   Something light, creamy and versatile. The cake is perfect with just
   about anything fruity, be it citrus curds, a drizzle of a thick fruit
   coulis, or fresh from the garden berries. Given that it is April, I
   wont pretend that any berries used today are fresh from the garden but
   as things warm up that will be a possibility. So let's talk cake!

Ladurée: Sucré Winner!

                               [piegohome.jpg]

                                [sucre2.JPG]

   Well noon (PST) as come and gone, so I think we're ready to pick a
   winner for the Sucre giveaway!
   So these Jellybeans on my nightstand. I guess we're all wondering how
   many I have, right?
   Okay, here is the deal: I like Jelly Belly beans. I really like them.
   Sometimes I have four pounds of them in a jar on my desk. Okay, so
   maybe that is a lot of candy to have casually sitting around, but could
   you really expect anything less with my sweet tooth?
   Well, I didn't have four pounds laying around last weekend. No. I had
   been nibbling on these beans for a couple months now, digging out the
   choice beans--like black licorice and juicy pear.  So when I did the
   count last Saturday all that remained were 255 beans. Weighing a total
   of 283 grams.

                                      [jellybeans2.JPG]
            Counting jellybeans, one by one, without eating any?
                               That's is hard!

   I've gone through all the guesses on the blog and in the NSHP email box
   and calculated who was closest with beans or grams and determined it
   was M with 292 grams:

     mFeb 19, 2012 06:35 PMLet's go with 292 grams. And I oooooh-ed
     several times during this post. First, when I saw you had posted
     (yay! yay! yay!) and again with the cookbok...and then again with
     the yummy pinkness. :)

   Congratulations! I'll be in contact with you via email and I'll have
   this cookbook to you soon. I hope you enjoy it. Of course, if you end
   up re-selling it on amazon for a cool two or three hundred dollars, I
   can't say I wouldn't understand.
   As for myself, I'm going to spend the rest of the weekend continuing to
   pack. No baking for me just yet, all my pans are already boxed up
   waiting on paperwork and a set of keys to finally change hands.
   I deserve a break from all this bubble wrap and packing tape. Maybe
   even a little indulgence in two guilty pleasures: a little world of
   warcraft and the rest of those jelly beans. Yum.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Edit: Woo! It appears that as of March 8th, Amazon actually has the
   book back in stock for list price. I'm not certain if it is back in
   print, but it is certainly going for less than $999 today.  Take that,
   price gougers!

Macarons Framboise - Ladurée's Recipe

                               [piegohome.jpg]

   [raspberry_macarons3.JPG]
   Well I'm back folks!
   Not really, but bear with me I'll be back in the groove of things as
   soon as I'm settled. I really have been busy, juggling some major
   changes around here. You see, among other things, I'm buying a new
   house and dealing with all the madness that goes along with that
   process. It's been a hectic couple of months but hopefully, if
   everything goes well, I'll be baking future macarons in a brand new
   oven soon.
   No, who am I kidding. The next several weeks will be spent packing and
   moving an entire household. Maybe replacing a few door knobs too, since
   our builder decided to go with a design that I can only describe as
   suitable for your Grandma's cottage--on Mars. Anyway, breaking in my
   bright and sunny new kitchen with a little baking will happen, I just
   need to get settled in.
