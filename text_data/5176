Math. Graphics. Programming.

   Whether you’re analyzing data, developing algorithms, or
   creating models, MATLAB is designed for the way you think
   and the work you do.
   matlab applications
   MATLAB Desktop

Millions of Engineers and Scientists Trust MATLAB

   MATLAB^® combines a desktop environment tuned for iterative analysis
   and design processes with a programming language that expresses matrix
   and array mathematics directly. It includes the Live Editor for
   creating scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an
   executable notebook.

Professionally Built

   MATLAB toolboxes are professionally developed, rigorously tested, and
   fully documented.

With Interactive Apps

   MATLAB apps let you see how different algorithms work with your data.
   Iterate until you’ve got the results you want, then automatically
   generate a MATLAB program to reproduce or automate your work.

And the Ability to Scale

   Scale your analyses to run on clusters, GPUs, and clouds with only
   minor code changes. There’s no need to rewrite your code or learn big
   data programming and out-of-memory techniques.

Take Your Ideas Beyond Research to Production

   Deploy to Production Systems

Deploy to Enterprise Applications

   MATLAB code is production ready, so you can go directly to your cloud
   and enterprise systems, and integrate with data sources and business
   systems.
   Hardware

Run on Embedded Devices

   Automatically convert MATLAB algorithms to C/C++, HDL, and CUDA code to
   run on your embedded processor or FPGA/ASIC.
   Run on Embedded Devices

Integrate with Model-Based Design

   MATLAB works with Simulink to support Model-Based Design, which is used
   for multidomain simulation, automatic code generation, and test and
   verification of embedded systems.

Engineers and Scientists Worldwide Rely on MATLAB

   [1568730156513.jpg]

ASML

     “As a process engineer I had no experience with neural networks or
     machine learning. I couldn’t have done this in C or Python. It
     would’ve taken too long to find, validate, and integrate the right
     packages.”
     Emil Schmitt-Weaver, Development Engineer

   [1560877657566.jpg]

MIT

     “MATLAB is the language used by virtually every team in the world
     that designs gravitational wave detectors… I look forward to
     exploring the data from each new detection in MATLAB.”
     Matthew Evans, Assistant Professor of Physics

   [1568730156313.jpg]

Delphi Automotive

     “MATLAB is my preferred tool because it speeds algorithm design and
     improvement. I can generate C code that is reliable, efficient, and
     easy for software engineers to integrate within a larger system.”
     Liang Ma, Systems Engineer

MATLAB and Simulink Work Together

   When you use MATLAB^® and Simulink^® together, you combine textual and
   graphical programming to design your system in a simulation
   environment.

   Directly use the thousands of algorithms that are already in MATLAB.
   Simply add your MATLAB code into a Simulink block or Stateflow^® chart.

   Use MATLAB to create input data sets to drive simulation. Run thousands
   of simulations in parallel. Then analyze and visualize the data in
   MATLAB.

Engineers and Scientists Worldwide Rely on Simulink

   [1566502369343.jpg]

NanoSemi

     “At a small company like ours, it’s critical for engineers to work
     with as little overhead as possible. With MATLAB, our team can
     deliver leading-edge IP faster, enabling our customers to increase
     bandwidth, push modulation rates higher, and reduce power
     consumption.”
     Nick Karter, Lead Engineer

   [1566502369445.jpg]

Fujitsu Laboratories of America

     “By including circuit-level simulation results in our Simulink
     models we can simulate millions of cycles with the accuracy needed
     to account for noise and other transient effects. Simulink is the
     only tool fast enough for our jitter-tolerance simulations.”
     William Walker, Vice President

   [1566502369546.jpg]

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

     “A primary benefit of using MATLAB and Simulink in our research is
     the availability of toolboxes for computer vision, image processing,
     and control system development. All the tools we need are in one
     environment that is easily integrated with other software for
     robotics and automation systems.”
     Dr. John Wen, head of the Industrial and Systems Engineering
     department
