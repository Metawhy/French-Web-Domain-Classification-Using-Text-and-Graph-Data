Automate your sales funnel with our bots

   Using Drift chatbots you can answer common questions in real time,
   route qualified leads to the right sales reps and start conversations
   with prospects in real time. Rep in a meeting? No problem, leads can
   book a time that works for them and your rep in seconds flat.
   automate your sales funnel

Generate more leads

   In order to generate more leads you start hosting more webinars, adding
   more forms to your site, syndicating content on third party sites, and
   adding BDRs to the team to source leads. Most of these additional
   sources you start using are way higher in the funnel than an inbound
   "contact sales" lead or potential trial download or freemium account.
   Using chatbots you can connect those leads to content that help drive
   them further down the funnel so they're ready to chat with your team
   faster.
   generate more leads with drift

Convert more traffic

   This isn't about a box on your website with someone to answer
   questions, this is an entirely new methodology for marketing and sales.
   Our framework provides future and current customers with a seamless
   experience that leaves them walking away surprised and delighted by
   your brand. Drift is about meeting the customer where they are, at
   exactly the instant they need help.

Drift sales automation software customizes the buying process

   Drift sales automation software is the only platform that lets your
   sales team deliver a personalized message on your website when
   prospects click through your emails. Now you can advance them through
   your funnel in real time instead of hoping they go back to their inbox
   and reply. Not around when your prospect is? No big deal — a chatbot
   can jump in and book the meeting for you.
   Drift turns real-time conversations into closed leads faster

   SALES MEETINGS

Let your sales team spend more time selling & less of it scheduling

   they’re qualified and ready to buy. Drift sales team assistant bots can
   book meetings automatically for you. But you can also drop your
   calendar into any conversation.

   SMART ALERTS

Let your sales team know exactly when VIP buyers visit your site.

   Drift sales automation software uses data enrichment to identify your
   important ABM targets and alert you as soon as they’re live on your
   website. You can also get alerts as soon as prospects open or click an
   email, so you can jump in and engage in real time.
   Drift account-based marketing allows you to target accounts when
   they're on your site

   Drift Sales Assistant Software

Take Hours of Busywork Off Your Plate.

   REAL-TIME NOTIFICATIONS

Drift enterprise marketing platform starts conversations with your dream
customers.

   We think about it like this: your website is your store. And if a
   target account walked into your store, you’d know right away and could
   walk up and say hello, right? Well that’s what Drift for Enterprise can
   do for your website. Your sales reps can get real-time notifications
   whenever a target account shows up so you can have more live chat
   conversations with your dream customers and book more meetings.

   With Drift enterprise marketing platform on your website, you can
   generate leads and book qualified sales meetings 24/7/365. It’s like

   ENTERPRISE ACCOUNT-BASED MARKETING

Let your target accounts skip the line.

   If you’ve already done the hard work of getting the right people to
   your website, why send them to fill out a form and then wait in line?
   That’s like having a neon “open” sign on your storefront but a padlock
   on the front door. With Drift Enterprise ABM, you can send personalized
   messages to target accounts so they can skip the line, hop right into a
   conversation, and get the buying experience they deserve.

   clicks. It’s about pipeline and revenue, so we’ve made it easy to show

     Looking at how marketing spent it’s money so far, Drift outperformed
     other lead sources in terms of opportunities created from Drift. For
     instance, leads that come through Drift conversations are 10x more
     likely to convert into opportunities than leads that came from our
     PPC campaigns.”

   Director of Marketing Operations, Ipswitch

     Drift enables sales and marketing teams to work together to convert
     traffic that is already on their website into qualified leads and
     pipeline. From the LeadBot, to the calendar integration, to Playbook
     templates, teams can get started with Drift quickly and see results
     just as fast. With Drift, MongoDB was about to increase our
     opportunities by 170% in three months.”
