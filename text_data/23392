       PART I. GENERAL
       Our commitment to privacy
       dataxu, inc. and our affiliate companies, dataxu ltd, dataxu GMBH,
       dataxu Australia PTY LTD, dataxu Singapore, Pte Ltd, dataxu Japan
       KK, and dataxu India Private Limited (collectively, “dataxu,” “we“,
       “us” and “our“) firmly believes in the importance of online
       privacy.  To ensure that your privacy is protected and your
       information choices are respected, we have set out in this Privacy
       Policy an explanation of how we may collect, use, and share data
       relating to individuals through our website, available at
       www.dataxu.com  and our affiliated domains, which include
       cdn.w55c.net, tags.w55c.net, cti.w55c.net, cts.w55c.net,
       ads.w55c.net, and i.w55c.net  (together, the “Website“), as well as
       through our marketing and analytics platform (“Platform“).This
       policy also describes how you can exercise your privacy rights.
       Introduction to dataxu
       Advertising supports free content and experiences we all love on
       the web, social media platforms, connected television platforms and
       on Internet-enabled mobile devices such as smartphones and
       tablets.  dataxu’s goal is to make advertising more effective by
       helping to display content that may be of interest to you. Relevant
       advertising is less annoying and assists the services that depend
       on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective content.
       To deliver relevant advertising to you, we may collect information
       about your activity across multiple third-party websites, devices
       or mobile applications.  We may use this information to predict the
       types of ads that may interest you and to display advertising to
       you based on that information (“Tailored Advertising”).  For
       example, if you visit multiple websites that feature articles about
       travel or you use a travel app, we may display travel-related ads
       to you on another website, device or app.
       dataxu is also a member of industry associates that govern policies
       around consumer privacy in the context of Tailored Advertising,
       including: the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA“); the Network
       Advertising Initiative (“NAI”); the European Interactive Digital
       Advertising Alliance’s (“EDAA“), as well as the Interactive
       Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) in the US. Dataxu complies with the
       DAA’s “Self Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral
       Advertising, the NAI’s “2018 Code of Conduct”, and the EDAA’s
       Principles.
   To learn more about tailored (or ‘Interest-Based’) advertising and your
       choices with respect to it, please visit

       / and http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/
       PART II. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
       What information do we collect via the dataxu Website and how do we
       use it?
       Personal information that you provide voluntarily
       Certain parts of our Website may ask you to provide personal
       information voluntarily: for example, we may ask you to provide
       your contact details in order to subscribe to marketing
       communications from us or to obtain content such as whitepapers and
       reports, and/or to submit enquiries to us. The personal information
       that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to
       provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to
       provide your personal information.
       You may also voluntarily supply us with personal information when
       you submit information on our “Contact Us” page or when you leave a
       comment and your name on our blog).
       When you provide personal information directly to us via the
       Website or email, it is used by dataxu solely for the purposes
       identified at the point at which you provide the information (e.g.
       for general marketing purposes or to notify you regarding updates
       to our products and services).
       Personal information that we collect automatically
       When you visit our Website, we may collect certain information
       automatically from your device.  In some countries, including
       countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), this information
       may be considered personal information under applicable data
       protection laws.
       Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include
       information like your IP address, device type, unique device
       identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location
       (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical
       information.  We may also collect information about how your device
       has interacted with our Website, including the pages accessed and
       links clicked.
       Collecting this information enables us to better understand the
       visitors who come to our Website, where they come from, and what
       content on our Website is of interest to them.  We use this
       information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the
       quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.
       Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar
       tracking technology, as explained further under the heading “What
       technologies do we deploy to collect and use behavioral
       information?” below.
       What information do we collect via the Platform?
       Information associated with website visits
        We use cookies and similar technologies to collect information
       about your browser type, operating system, internet provider, IP
       address, domain name, the pages that you visit on third party
       websites, the actions that you take on those websites, the date and
       time of your visits to third party websites, and whether you
       respond to an online ad.
       Information associated with mobile website or application visits
       For mobile users, we collect device types, device make and model,
       operating system, mobile advertising identifiers (e.g. IDFA on
       iPhone, Google ADID on Android), operating system device
       identifier, information about the types of apps you use and the GPS
       location of your device (subject to your provision of opt-in
       consent).
       Information associated with connected TV devices or ‘over-the-top’
       (OTT) video applications and service providers
       We may receive unique identifiers associated with connected TV
       devices, as well as general information about the video content
       associated with the delivery of advertising. However, we do not
       receive information about the specific video content viewed nor
       associate advertising profiles based on viewed video content
       without first receiving opt-in consent.
       Our use of cookies and similar tracking technologies is explained
       further under the heading “What technologies do we deploy to
       collect and use behavioral information?” below.
       Personally Identifiable and Sensitive Information
       We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your
       name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.  However, please
       note that our clients may use the Platform to deliver
       advertisements based on previously personal, but now de-identified,
       pseudonymized or otherwise ‘audience-matched’ information. We do
       not link, combine or re-identifiy personally identifiable
       information with information collected through the Platform without
       your opt-in consent.
       We do not collect, nor contractually allow our clients to collect,
       sensitive information such as Social Security Number, credit card
       information, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers or
       health related information.  Outside of the EEA, Platform users may
       use general health-related segments which do not contain sensitive
       health data. Dataxu adheres to the codes and principles of the NAI,
       DAA and EDAA with respect to such sensitive data collection
       activities. Click here for a list of the standard health-related
       segments provided by third-party data providers.
       What information do our customers / partners collect via the
       Platform?
       Sometimes our customers include their own (or their partners’)
       pixels or similar technologies within advertisements that dataxu
       serves to websites, devices or mobile applications.  This is in
       order for our customers to set and read their own cookies (which
       are not subject to the control of dataxu) for fraud prevention or
       to measure advertising performance.
       In addition, if you visit a website or mobile application that uses
       the Platform, or click through an ad to the website or online
       service of one of our customers, those customers may collect
       additional information about your visit beyond the information
       described in this Privacy Policy. They may also allow other
       companies (such as other ad networks or web analytics services) to
       collect information through mechanisms such as cookies, pixels and
       similar technologies.
       dataxu is not responsible for and cannot control the data
       collection and use practices of its customers. You should read the
       privacy policies of the websites you visit and the online services
       and interactive ads that you use in order to understand the type of
       information companies collect and how they use that information.
       Third Party Data Sources
       Our customers may purchase data from approved data vendors and will
       input that data into the Platform to perform tailored advertising.
       Dataxu only works with vendors or partners who represent and
       warrant that they will only provide data that has been collected in
       compliance with applicable law and self-regulatory guidelines, and
       on an opt-in basis wherever required.
       How do we use information collected via the Platform?
       We use information collected via the Platform for a variety of
       purposes, including to:
          + deliver tailored advertising to websites, devices and mobile
            applications on behalf of advertisers;
          + enable our customers to determine which advertisement may be
            suitable to be delivered to you;
          + associate the browsers, devices and applications used by the
            same visitor or household;
          + to monitor the success of and manage advertising campaigns;
            and
          + attribute advertising performance with your actions with our
            clients’ products or services;
          + compile statistics, create reporting and analytics – all of
            which are done in the aggregate and without identifying you;
          + detect and prevent fraudulent or otherwise invalid
            advertising-related activities such as clickfraud
       With whom do we share information collected via the Website or
       Platform?
       We may share and disclose collected information in the following
       circumstances:
          + Group companies and partners –who process personal information
            for purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or
            notified to you when we collect your personal information.
          + Customers and customers’ partners – we may share information
            with our customers and customers’ partners for lawful
            advertising purposes;

            share information with third party vendors, consultants and
            other service providers who are working on our or our
            customers’ behalf and require access to such information to
            undertake that work e.g. to provide data storage and
            processing services.  To see a full list of our vendors,
            consultants and other service providers or ‘subprocessors’,
            click here.
          + Compliance with laws – we may disclose information to a third
            party where we are legally required to do so in order to
            comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
            government request, including to meet national security or law
            enforcement requirements;
          + Vital interests and legal rights – we may disclose information
            where we believe it necessary in order to protect the vital
            interests of any person, or to exercise, establish or defend
            our legal rights; and
          + Business transfers – we may share or transfer information in
            connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale

          + to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.
       PART III.  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DO WE DEPLOY TO COLLECT AND USE
       INFORMATION THROUGH THE PLATFORM?
       We use a variety of technologies on our Website and our Platform
       including cookies, pixel tags and scripts to collect and use
       Behavioral Information.
       Cookies
       A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on your computer
       or device when you view an advertisement or website relating to one
       of our customers.  The cookie does not contain any data that
       enables us to determine your actual identity. Instead, we use
       cookies to determine how visits to a website and views of an
       advertisement.
       dataxu cookies may be served from any of the following domains:
       dataxu.net, us.dataxu.net, www.w55c.net, cdn.w55c.net,
       tags.w55c.net, cti.w55c.net, cts.w55c.net, ads.w55c.net, and
       i.w55c.net.  For more information on our operation of these
       domains, click https://www.w55c.net/.
       To read more about our use of cookies, including how you can change
       your cookie preferences with respect to dataxu websites, please see
       our Cookie Policy available here.
       Pixel tags
       Pixel tags are small, invisible images on a webpage or other
       document.  Pixel tags allow the operator of the webpage or other
       document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read
       and modify cookies.
       Our pixel tags allow dataxu cookies to be set, read and modified
       when you visit the websites of our partners.  Our pixel tags also
       allow our partners to better understand how you interact with their
       websites by observing which pages on their websites are visited.
       Server to server technology with third parties
       We may synchronize information collected through the Platform with
       information collected by third parties (including cross-device
       identifiers as described below).  We do not control the privacy
       practices of these third parties.
       Cross-device and cross-app technology
       We and our customers may use technology that establishes
       deterministic or statistical connections among related devices
       (such as smartphones, tablets, connected TV devices and computers)
       to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising
       analytics and reporting purposes.  For example, dataxu or its
       partners may match your devices if you log into the same online
       service on multiple devices or web browsers, or if your devices
       share similar attributes that support an inference that they are
       used by the same person or household. This means that information
       about your use of websites or applications on your current device
       may be combined with information from your other devices.  This
       allows, for example, ads you see on your tablet to be based on
       activities you engaged in on your smartphone.
       We may partner with third parties to provide such cross-device
       technology to our customers, and we may share unique identifiers
       (such as cookies or your mobile device’s IDFA or Google adID) with
       those third parties to make connections among related devices.  We
       may also use your device’s IP address to infer connections among
       related devices within the same household. To opt out of dataxu’s
       use of such technologies for each web browser and on each of your
       devices, please follow the instructions for Opting Out as described
       in the Opting Out section below.
       We and our customers may collect information about your activity
       across multiple unaffiliated third-party mobile applications.  We
       may share this information with our customers to help them predict
       the types of ads that may interest you and to display advertising
       to you based on that information.  For example, if you use a travel
       app, we or our customers may display travel-related ads to you on
       another app. We or our customers may combine this information with
       a mobile advertising identifier (such as your mobile device’s IDFA
       or Google adID), and we may retain it for up to 13 months, as
       described in the Security and Storage section below.   If you would
       like to opt out of Interest-Based Advertising practices in mobile
       applications, please follow the instructions in the Opting Out
       section below.
       Connected TV devices or ‘over-the-top’ (OTT) video applications and
       service providers
       These devices and applications have a proprietary set of
       methodologies to collect and share information with dataxu for
       advertising purposes, including unique device identifiers, cookies,
       IP addresses, location as well as local storage such as through
       video player settings.  To learn more about opting-out of these
       collection practices, refer to the Opting Out section below.
       Do Not Track (“DNT”) and “Limit Ad Tracking”
       DNT is a privacy preference that users may set in certain web
       browsers.  It is intended to allow users another method of
       informing websites and services that they do not want certain
       information about their website visits to be collected over time
       and across websites.
       Our technology does not respond to “do not track” (a/k/a DNT)
       signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers or mobile
       device operating systems.  In the event that dataxu identifies the
       “Limit Ad Tracking” feature in Apple iOS version 9 and earlier, the
       device will be opted-out of advertising. To learn more about how
       you can exercise choices about the collection and use of certain
       data online for purposes of Interest-Based Advertising, please see
       the Opting Out section below.
       PART IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA (EEA VISITORS
       ONLY)
       If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, our legal
       basis for collecting and using the personal data described above
       will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context
       in which we collect it.
       However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where
       we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal
       information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing
       is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data
       protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some
       cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data
       from you. If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a
       legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make
       this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the
       provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of
       the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal
       data).
       Similarly, if we collect and use your personal data in reliance on
       our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will
       make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate
       interests are.
       If you have questions about or need further information concerning
       the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data,
       please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How
       to contact us” heading below.
       PART V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY, AND RETENTION
       Personal data collected outside the United States, including in the
       EEA , is transferred to and stored on our servers in the United
       States, the Netherlands and Singapore, and potentially in other
       countries whose data protection laws may be different to the laws
       in your country.  We will protect your personal data in accordance
       with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.
       Transfer Mechanisms
       EU-US Privacy Shield
       dataxu complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set
       forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection,
       use, and retention of personal data from European Union member
       countries.
       dataxu has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield
       Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer,

       dataxu’s accountability for personal data that it receives under
       the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is
       described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, dataxu
       remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles
       if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data
       on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles,
       unless dataxu proves that it is not responsible for the event
       giving rise to the damage.
       In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, dataxu
       commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection
       or use of your personal data. European Union individuals with
       inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first
       contact dataxu directly at dataprivacy@dataxu.com. We will respond
       to your complaint within 45 days of receipt.
       We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints
       under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD,
       a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the
       United States and operated by the Council of Better Business
       Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
       complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed,
       please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for
       more information and to file a complaint.
       If your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, and your inquiry
       or complaint involves human resources data, you may have your
       complaint considered by an independent recourse mechanism: for
       EU/EEA Data Subjects, a panel established by the EU data protection
       authorities (“DPA Panel”). To do so, you should contact the state
       or national data protection or labor authority in the jurisdiction
       where you work. Dataxu agrees to cooperate with the relevant
       national DPAs and to comply with the decisions of the DPA Panel.
       For residual disputes that cannot be resolved by the methods above,
       under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be
       available before a Privacy Shield Panel. To find out more about the
       Privacy Shield’s binding arbitration scheme, please see:
       https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.
       The Federal Trade Commission has investigation and enforcement
       authority over our compliance with the Privacy Shield.
       International Data Transfers Using Model Contracts
       dataxu also relies on Model Clauses set forth by the European
       Commission for intercompany transfers of personal data from the EEA
       to our data centers located in Singapore.  Dataxu also has in place
       model clauses with any third-party vendors or partners to whom it
       may pass personal information.
