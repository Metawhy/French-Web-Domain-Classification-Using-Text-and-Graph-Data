THE SOLUTION
     __________________________________________________________________

Embrace the Power of Enterprise Blockchains Without Exposing Private Data

   QEDIT offers a cryptographically-secure privacy solution for enterprise
   blockchains that enhances trust and enables open collaboration among
   competitors and industry partners.

   We leverage zero-knowledge proof cryptography to facilitate the
   transfer of digital assets on a shared ledger while ensuring that
   private transactional details (who sent what, and how much, to whom)
   are never exposed.

   In addition to safeguarding sensitive business data, we keep companies
   compliant with local data privacy regulations through permissioned
   auditing tools for controlled transparency.
