   By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
   laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and
   Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of
   2006 (Public Law 109-367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal
   Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law
   104-208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and
   territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that
   the Nation’s immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order
   as follows:

   Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the
   national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the
   United States without inspection or admission present a significant
   threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not
   been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to
   determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of
   illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a
   significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies
   charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as
   the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.

   Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and
   human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of
   the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent
   crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who
   illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of
   terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a
   clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.

   Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides
   the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border
   States, to secure the Nation’s southern border. Although Federal
   immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State
   partnership in enforcing our immigration laws – and the Congress has
   authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders – the
   Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign
   responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive
   departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to
   secure the Nation’s southern border, to prevent further illegal
   immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens
   swiftly, consistently, and humanely.

   Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:

   (a) secure the southern border of the United States through the
   immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,
   monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal
   immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;

   (b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or
   State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further
   proceedings regarding those violations;

   (c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals’ claims of
   eligibility to remain in the United States;

   (d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in
   the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate
   civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed;

   (e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting
   Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities,
   as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent
   with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.

   Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) “Asylum officer” has the meaning given the
   term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).

   (b) “Southern border” shall mean the contiguous land border between the
   United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.

   (c) “Border States” shall mean the States of the United States
   immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United
   States and Mexico.

   (d) Except as otherwise noted, “the Secretary” shall refer to the
   Secretary of Homeland Security.

   (e) “Wall” shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly
   secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.

   (f) “Executive department” shall have the meaning given in section 101
   of title 5, United States Code.

   (g) “Regulations” shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations,
   and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.

   (h) “Operational control” shall mean the prevention of all unlawful
   entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other
   unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other
   contraband.

   Sec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States.
   The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain
   complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the
   southern border:

   (a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and
   IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and
   construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate
   materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete
   operational control of the southern border;

   (b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources
   of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a
   physical wall along the southern border;

   (c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall,
   including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and
   upcoming fiscal years; and

   (d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern
   border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall
   include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical
   and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of
   Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational
   control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain
   complete operational control of the southern border.

   Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all
   appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to
   immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to
   construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near
   the land border with Mexico.

   (b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all
   legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to
   immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum
   referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to
   section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable
   regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable
   regulations.

   (c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate
   all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration
   judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by
   the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the
   Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under
   title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.

   Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately
   take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens
   apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of
   their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the
   extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance
   to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the
   appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the
   INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as “catch
   and release,” whereby aliens are routinely released in the United
   States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration
   law.

   Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate
   action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8,
   United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section
   235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the
   territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.

   Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available
   appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs
   and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000
   additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure
   that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as
   soon as is practicable.

   Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive
   department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct
   and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on
   an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and
   multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid,
   and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of
   each executive department and agency shall submit this information to
   the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the
   Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report
   reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided
   annually, over each of the past five years.

   Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive
   branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the
   country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the
   interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.

   (a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take
   appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well
   as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into
   agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).

   (b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or
   local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate
   action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or
   otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as
   the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the
   functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation,
   apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the
   direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization
   shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance
   of these duties.

   (c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each
   agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides
   the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and
   obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.

   Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive
   branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used
   to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.

   (a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to
   ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law
   are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise
   removable aliens.

   (b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by
   promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum
   referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section
   235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and
   reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted
   in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.

   (c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary
   shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable
   discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the
   INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).

   (d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole
   authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is
   exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain
   language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an
   individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant
   public benefit derived from such parole.

   (e) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all
   Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the
   proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce
   Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C.
   1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6
   U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are
   properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the
   custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate,
   are safely repatriated in accordance with law.

   Sec. 12. Authorization to Enter Federal Lands. The Secretary, in
   conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of
   agencies as necessary, shall take all appropriate action to:

   (a) permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as
   all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have
   access to all Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement
   this order; and

   (b) enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well
   as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to
   perform such actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary
   and appropriate to implement this order.

   Sec. 13. Priority Enforcement. The Attorney General shall take all
   appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate
   appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high
   priority to prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern
   border.

   Sec. 14. Government Transparency. The Secretary shall, on a monthly
   basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on
   aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform
   method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components,
   in a format that is easily understandable by the public.

   Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the
   Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney
   General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report
   on the progress of the directives contained in this order.

   Sec. 16. Hiring. The Office of Personnel Management shall take
   appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel
   to implement this order.

   Sec. 17. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be
   construed to impair or otherwise affect:

   (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
   or the head thereof; or

   (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
   Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

   (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
   subject to the availability of appropriations.

   (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
   benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
   any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
   entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

   Oval Office

   11:27 A.M. EDT

   THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Thank you very much. I very much appreciate your
   being here. We have hurricane reports on Hurricane Michael.
   Unbelievably destructive, powerful.

   The one good thing we can say — we were just discussing — is that it
   was the fastest hurricane anybody has seen. It just was speedy. If it
   wasn’t, there would be absolutely nothing left. It was incredibly
   powerful. You’ve seen the destruction.

   It’s moving through Georgia now at a much lesser pace both in terms of
   speed and in terms of its power — 50, 60-mile-an-hour winds. But some
   of those winds reached almost 200 miles an hour, which is unheard of.
   People are saying it’s the third most powerful that they’ve seen hit
   our country anywhere.

   We’ve done — I’ll tell you, FEMA has gotten rave reviews. The first
   responders, law enforcement — everybody has gotten rave reviews. I just
   spoke with Governor Scott. They’re very happy. Food is being now —
   following the hurricane — being now brought in. We have unbelievable
   large amounts of water and food and everything that people can want.

   The electric companies have been terrific. They’re already working. The
   roads are being cleared out. Many trees are in the path of the electric
   companies.

   The roads are being cleaned right now. They’re being — for the most
   part, they’re open enough to get the electric companies in. And a lot
   of electricity is already back on. Some of the off electricity is
   already back on. That’s in Florida. They’re following up in Georgia.

   A lot of water will be in North and South Carolina, added to the
   horrible situation they had with Florence two weeks ago. But they’re
   incredible people and they know how to do it. They’ve done it before
   and they’ll do it again. But they know how to do it.

   So we’ve had great reports in everything. The only — the big problem
   with this hurricane was the tremendous power. And fortunately, it was
   very fast. It went through Florida very, very quickly. It didn’t
   linger. It didn’t come back as we had in Texas, where it actually came
   back a second time and then a third time. It went out, filled up, came
   back. This one went very quickly. But it’s tremendous destruction in
   the areas where it — the path that it chose is incredible, the kind of
   destruction. We’ve not seen destruction like that in a long time.

   But it’s — the rebuilding, I can actually say — the rebuilding process
   and the survivor-looking process, we hope we don’t have too much of
   that. The area most affected was, hopefully, 100 percent evacuated, but
   there’s always somebody that stays. And in this case, they would have
   been in big trouble.

   But so far, the reports, as you know, are very good. So I want to thank
   you for that.

   And I don’t know if you have any questions on the hurricane. Does
   anybody have any questions?

   Q Do you have enough time to focus on the hurricane? You have a very
   busy day at the White House. Obviously, Kanye West is here and —

   THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I do. I have a very busy day today. We’re doing —
   as you know, we’re doing — having to do with copyright music. We’re
   doing, right now, the Save Our Seas Act of 2018, which is a very
   important thing. But I — and yesterday I had a tremendous rally in
   Pennsylvania, and we had thousands of people lined up. And I just
   couldn’t — you couldn’t tell those people — and they were there for a
   day and a half before.

   And I couldn’t tell people that had been standing in line for a day and
   a half, wanting to get into the arena, that I’m not going. I went
   there. We had great control over what we were doing both on Air Force
   One, at the White House, and in Florida.

   And I think you’re seeing we’re getting tremendous marks for the job
   that we did. And I wasn’t going to disappoint thousands and thousands
   of people who have been standing in line for, in some cases, a day and
   a half. I wasn’t going to do that.

   But I think we’ve really, really done a job. This is a particularly
   busy day because we’re signing a number of bills. Very different kinds
   of bills. So you’ll be seeing me a little while later, I think with a
   couple of the senators standing behind me right now. And you’ll be
   seeing me and us in a little while.

   And we’re having lunch with Jim Brown, one of the great football
   players of all time and a great guy, and Kanye West. He’s coming in —
   they’re coming in for lunch. And after that, we’re doing some
   additional interesting things.

   But we have a busy day. But I always have a busy day.

   And the economy is doing really well. Jobs are looking — we think jobs
   are going to be better than ever. And we think records are broken
   already, but we’re going to continue to break the records.

   So let’s talk about the Save Our Seas Act, if we could. And again,
   thank you all for being here. I want to thank also the members of
   Congress that are with us. That’s Senator Dan Sullivan, who’s been
   absolutely terrific; worked along with Sheldon Whitehouse. And these
   two have been spearheading something that’s very important, and we want
   to thank you both.

   Sheldon, thank you very much.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. President.

   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Really do. I know
   you worked very hard on that.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: Worked well together.

   THE PRESIDENT: And, Mr. Sullivan, thank you very much for being here.
   We appreciate it very much.

   We have Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross who worked along with the
   senators, and Acting NOAA Administrator Admiral Tim Gallaudet. You’re
   here, and thank you for being here, Tim. Thank you very much. Great job
   you’re doing.

   Every year, over 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into our beautiful
   oceans by many countries of the world. That includes China, that
   includes Japan, and that includes many, many countries.

   This waste, trash, and debris harms not only marine life, but also
   fishermen, coastal economies along America’s vast stretches. The bad
   news is it floats toward us. I’ve seen pictures recently, and some of
   you have seen them, where there’s — a vast, tremendous, unthinkable
   amount of garbage is floating right into our coast, in particular along
   the West Coast.

   And we’re charged with removing it, which is a very unfair situation.
   It comes from other countries very far away. It takes six months and a
   year to float over, but it gets here, and it’s a very unfair situation.
   It’s also unbelievably bad for the oceans.

   Every year, over 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into our beautiful
   oceans. And when you think of that number — I mean, to think 8 million
   tons — and I would say it’s probably — Senators, I think it’s probably
   more than that, based on what I’ve seen and based on the kind of work
   that I’ve seen being done.

   This dumping has happened for years and even for decades. Previous
   administrations did absolutely nothing to take on the foreign countries
   responsible. We’ve already notified most of them and we’ve notified
   them very strongly.

   The Save Our Seas Act will help address this problem by extending the
   Marine Debris Program for five additional years. We also are
   strengthening that up to improve waste management overseas and clean up
   our nation’s water. We will boost the federal government’s response to
   ocean waste by authorizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration to declare severe marine debris events, which happen all
   the time. It’s incredible. It’s incredible when you look at it. People
   don’t realize it, but all the time we’re being inundated by debris from
   other countries.

   This legislation will release funds to states for cleanup and for
   response efforts. And we will be responding and very strongly.

   The legislation also encourages the executive branch to engage with
   those nations responsible for dumping garbage into our oceans. My
   administration is doing exactly that. For example, the new United
   States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is the first U.S. trade agreement ever
   to include commitments by the parties to cooperate to address land- and
   sea-based pollution and improve waste management.

   And I can tell you that Dan and Sheldon were very insistent on trying
   to get that into the USMCA, the new agreement that we have with Canada
   and Mexico. And we’ll be putting it into other agreements also.

   The United States has some of the most beautiful beaches and oceans in
   the world, and the coastlines are incredible. As President, I will
   continue to do everything I can to stop other nations from making our
   oceans into their landfills. That’s why I’m pleased — very pleased, I
   must say — to put my signature on this important legislation.

   And again, I’d like to thank Dan and Sheldon, and all of the people —
   the Admiral and Wilbur — all of the people that worked so hard on this.
   This was a tough one, but it had great bipartisan support.

   What was the final vote?

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: It was unanimous consent in the Senate.

   THE PRESIDENT: Unanimous.

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: Yes, sir.

   THE PRESIDENT: Bipartisan. Did you ever think, Jon, you’d hear that?
   Bipartisan.

   Q It’s unusual to see Sheldon Whitehouse here.

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s pretty good. Can you imagine Trump and
   Whitehouse in the same area? It’s all right. Hey, I have a lot of
   respect.

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: And what the President said about the administration
   — the Trump administration — doing a great job on this, it’s an
   underreported story but they are really taking the lead globally. And,
   Mr. President, we want to thank you for (inaudible) very bipartisan.

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Sheldon.
   Thank you. Come here, Sheldon. See, we can shake hands.

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much.

   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Wilbur. Thank you. Admiral, thank you.

   All right. Let’s get this done properly here.

   (The bill is signed.)

   So with that, we’re all completed. And I just want to say it’s an
   honor. And hopefully that goes a long way for our oceans.

   We’ve notified other countries that have been abusers. They abuse the
   ocean. We have notified them already about this. And they’re doing
   things. They tell us they’re doing things. And I think some cases at
   least they are. But they will be.

   And I want to thank you very much.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. President. The Philippines is up
   next, Mr. President.

   THE PRESIDENT: Yes, that’s right.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: The Philippines is up next. They’re one of the
   worst three.

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s right. That’s going to be interesting.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: So, thank you.

   THE PRESIDENT: So you’re working on that?

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: We are.

   THE PRESIDENT: That’s very good.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: With your trade team on the Philippine trade
   agreement. We’ll make sure this is part of that.

   THE PRESIDENT: We’re okay with that. I understand. A lot comes from
   there.

   Yes.

   Q Mr. President, what exactly is the U.S. doing to investigate the
   missing Saudi journalist? You said there were U.S. investigators over
   there.

   THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we’re looking at it.

   Q Could you explain what exactly that means?

   THE PRESIDENT: We’re looking at it very strongly. We’ll be having a
   report out soon. We’re working with Turkey, we’re working with Saudi
   Arabia. What happened is a terrible thing, assuming that happened. I
   mean, maybe we’ll be pleasantly surprised, but somehow I tend to doubt
   it. And we take it very seriously.

   Q Does the U.S. have any kind of responsibility to warn him if
   (inaudible) were picked up?

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s not our country. It’s in Turkey, and it’s not
   a citizen, as I understand it. But a thing like that shouldn’t happen.
   It is a reporter with the Washington Post, and it’s — something like
   that should not be allowed to happen. Something like that should not
   happen. And we intend to get to the bottom of it.

   Yes.

   Q Mr. President, you have talked a little bit about the markets. The
   markets are down again, today. How long do you think this correction,
   which you said was coming anyway, is expected to last?

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’re still up 40 percent for the period of time.
   So, I mean, the markets are way up over what they were. It’s a
   correction that I think is caused by the Federal Reserve with interest
   rates. The dollar has become very strong, which, frankly, people can
   debate whether or not they like a strong dollar or not.

   The dollar is very strong, very powerful. And that causes a little
   difficulty with doing business, frankly. A strong dollar doesn’t
   necessarily mean all good, but we do have a very strong dollar. And we
   have interest rates going up at a clip that’s much faster than
   certainly a lot of people, including myself, would have anticipated.

   I think the Fed is out of control. I think what they’re doing it wrong.
   Under the Obama administration, you had a lot of help because they had
   very little interest. You know, when you talk about economies, our
   economy is far better than that. But we have actually — we’re paying
   interest. And they weren’t. They were using funny money.

   But I think the Fed is far too stringent, and they’re making a mistake
   and it’s not right.

   And it’s — despite that, we’re doing very well but it’s not necessary,
   in my opinion. And I think I know about it better than they do. Believe
   me.

   Q Would you consider firing the Fed Chairman? I mean, is his job
   secure?

   THE PRESIDENT: No, I’m not going to fire him. I’m just disappointed at
   the clip. I think it’s far too fast. Far too rigid, far too fast.

   Q Mr. President, after what happened with the Soyuz capsule today, are
   you at all worried that American astronauts have to rely on the
   Russians to get into space? Because you’ve been talking about Space
   Force.

   THE PRESIDENT: No, I’m not worried. We have a tremendous space program
   going right now, in addition to which you’re going to have the Space
   Force. I think by next year we intend to have that. It’s already in
   this budget. And we’ll have our own everything. But no, I’m not at all.
   Not at all worried at all.

   Q Will Jamal Khashoggi’s case affect the way you deal with MBS or other
   Saudi officials?

   THE PRESIDENT: We’ll have to see what happens. A lot of work is being
   done on that, and we’re going to have to see what happens. I don’t like
   stopping massive amounts of money that’s being poured into our country
   on — I know they’re talking about different kinds of sanctions, but
   they’re spending $110 billion on military equipment and on things that
   create jobs, like jobs and others, for this country.

   I don’t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into
   the United States. Because you know what they’re going to do? They’re
   going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China, or someplace
   else. So I think there are other ways. If it turns out to be as bad as
   it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling the situation.

   But I will tell you, upfront, right now, and I’ll say it in front of
   senators: They’re spending $110 billion purchasing military equipment
   and other things. If we don’t sell it to them, they’ll say, “Well,
   thank you very much. We’ll buy it from Russia.” Or “Thank you very
   much. We’ll buy it from China.” That doesn’t help us — not when it
   comes to jobs and not when it comes to our companies losing out on that
   work.

   But there are other things we can do. Let’s find out what the problem
   is first. Okay?

   Q You mean sanctions in that case? You oppose sanctions against Saudi
   Arabia?

   THE PRESIDENT: I oppose — I would not be in favor of stopping a country
   from spending $110 billion — which is an all-time record — and letting
   Russia have that money and letting China have that money. Because all
   they’re going to do is say, “That’s okay. We don’t have to buy it from
   Boeing. We don’t have to buy it from Lockheed. We don’t have to buy it
   from Raytheon and all these great companies. We’ll buy it from Russia.
   We’ll but it from China.”

   So what good does that do us? There are other things we can do.

   Q Well, do you think they should pay a price if it turns out that the
   Saudis are responsible?

   THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. There’ll be something that has to take place.
   First, I want to find out what happened. And we’re looking. Again, this
   took place in Turkey. And to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi is
   not a United States citizen. Is that right? Or is that —

   Q Permanent resident.

   THE PRESIDENT: He’s a permanent resident. Okay.

   We don’t like it, Jon. We don’t like. And we don’t like even a little
   bit. But as to whether or not we should stop $110 billion from being
   spent in this country, knowing they have four or five alternatives, two
   very good alternatives — that would not be acceptable to me.

   Okay. But we’re looking for the answer. And I think probably you’ll
   have an answer sooner than people think.

   Thank you very much. I’ll see you in a little while.

   Q We’ll see you with Kanye later? Are you going to —

   THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We’re going to have you come in for Kanye for just
   a couple of seconds, okay?

   Q Okay, great.

   THE PRESIDENT: He’ll be here and we’re going to do a little — you’ll
   have a little fun. Okay?

   Everybody asks about Kanye. You know, we have Kanye West and Jim Brown
   coming in. And everybody wants to know about —

   Q (Inaudible) Jim Brown too.

   THE PRESIDENT: I like Jim Brown. That Jim Brown is some running back.
   Hey, do you think the NFL would be paying him a couple of dollars
   nowadays?

   What people don’t know — he might have been — he was the greatest
   football player, perhaps. He may have been an even better lacrosse
   player. Did you know that? At Syracuse. He may have been an even better
   lacrosse player. And he’s a great guy. And he’s been with me for a long
   time. He’s been a big supporter.

   Thank you all very much. You’ll come back in a little while.

   By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
   laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and
   Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of
   2006 (Public Law 109-367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal
   Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law
   104-208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and
   territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that
   the Nation’s immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order
   as follows:

   Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the
   national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the
   United States without inspection or admission present a significant
   threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not
   been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to
   determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of
   illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a
   significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies
   charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as
   the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.

   Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and
   human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of
   the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent
   crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who
   illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of
   terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a
   clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.

   Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides
   the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border
   States, to secure the Nation’s southern border. Although Federal
   immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State
   partnership in enforcing our immigration laws – and the Congress has
   authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders – the
   Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign
   responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive
   departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to
   secure the Nation’s southern border, to prevent further illegal
   immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens
   swiftly, consistently, and humanely.

   Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:

   (a) secure the southern border of the United States through the
   immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,
   monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal
   immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;

   (b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or
   State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further
   proceedings regarding those violations;

   (c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals’ claims of
   eligibility to remain in the United States;

   (d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in
   the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate
   civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed;

   (e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting
   Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities,
   as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent
   with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.

   Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) “Asylum officer” has the meaning given the
   term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).

   (b) “Southern border” shall mean the contiguous land border between the
   United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.

   (c) “Border States” shall mean the States of the United States
   immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United
   States and Mexico.

   (d) Except as otherwise noted, “the Secretary” shall refer to the
   Secretary of Homeland Security.

   (e) “Wall” shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly
   secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.

   (f) “Executive department” shall have the meaning given in section 101
   of title 5, United States Code.

   (g) “Regulations” shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations,
   and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.

   (h) “Operational control” shall mean the prevention of all unlawful
   entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other
   unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other
   contraband.

   Sec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States.
   The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain
   complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the
   southern border:

   (a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and
   IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and
   construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate
   materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete
   operational control of the southern border;

   (b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources
   of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a
   physical wall along the southern border;

   (c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall,
   including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and
   upcoming fiscal years; and

   (d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern
   border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall
   include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical
   and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of
   Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational
   control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain
   complete operational control of the southern border.

   Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all
   appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to
   immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to
   construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near
   the land border with Mexico.

   (b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all
   legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to
   immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum
   referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to
   section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable
   regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable
   regulations.

   (c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate
   all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration
   judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by
   the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the
   Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under
   title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.

   Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately
   take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens
   apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of
   their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the
   extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance
   to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the
   appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the
   INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as “catch
   and release,” whereby aliens are routinely released in the United
   States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration
   law.

   Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate
   action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8,
   United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section
   235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the
   territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.

   Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available
   appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs
   and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000
   additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure
   that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as
   soon as is practicable.

   Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive
   department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct
   and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on
   an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and
   multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid,
   and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of
   each executive department and agency shall submit this information to
   the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the
   Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report
   reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided
   annually, over each of the past five years.

   Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive
   branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the
   country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the
   interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.

   (a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take
   appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well
   as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into
   agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).

   (b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or
   local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate
   action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or
   otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as
   the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the
   functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation,
   apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the
   direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization
   shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance
   of these duties.

   (c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each
   agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides
   the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and
   obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.

   Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive
   branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used
   to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.

   (a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to
   ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law
   are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise
   removable aliens.

   (b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by
   promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum
   referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section
   235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and
   reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted
   in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.

   (c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary
   shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable
   discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the
   INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).

   (d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole
   authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is
   exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain
   language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an
   individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant
   public benefit derived from such parole.

   (e) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all
   Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the
   proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce
   Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C.
   1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6
   U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are
   properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the
   custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate,
   are safely repatriated in accordance with law.

   Sec. 12. Authorization to Enter Federal Lands. The Secretary, in
   conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of
   agencies as necessary, shall take all appropriate action to:

   (a) permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as
   all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have
   access to all Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement
   this order; and

   (b) enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well
   as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to
   perform such actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary
   and appropriate to implement this order.

   Sec. 13. Priority Enforcement. The Attorney General shall take all
   appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate
   appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high
   priority to prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern
   border.

   Sec. 14. Government Transparency. The Secretary shall, on a monthly
   basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on
   aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform
   method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components,
   in a format that is easily understandable by the public.

   Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the
   Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney
   General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report
   on the progress of the directives contained in this order.

   Sec. 16. Hiring. The Office of Personnel Management shall take
   appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel
   to implement this order.

   Sec. 17. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be
   construed to impair or otherwise affect:

   (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
   or the head thereof; or

   (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
   Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

   (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
   subject to the availability of appropriations.

   (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
   benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
   any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
   entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

   Oval Office

   11:27 A.M. EDT

   THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Thank you very much. I very much appreciate your
   being here. We have hurricane reports on Hurricane Michael.
   Unbelievably destructive, powerful.

   The one good thing we can say — we were just discussing — is that it
   was the fastest hurricane anybody has seen. It just was speedy. If it
   wasn’t, there would be absolutely nothing left. It was incredibly
   powerful. You’ve seen the destruction.

   It’s moving through Georgia now at a much lesser pace both in terms of
   speed and in terms of its power — 50, 60-mile-an-hour winds. But some
   of those winds reached almost 200 miles an hour, which is unheard of.
   People are saying it’s the third most powerful that they’ve seen hit
   our country anywhere.

   We’ve done — I’ll tell you, FEMA has gotten rave reviews. The first
   responders, law enforcement — everybody has gotten rave reviews. I just
   spoke with Governor Scott. They’re very happy. Food is being now —
   following the hurricane — being now brought in. We have unbelievable
   large amounts of water and food and everything that people can want.

   The electric companies have been terrific. They’re already working. The
   roads are being cleared out. Many trees are in the path of the electric
   companies.

   The roads are being cleaned right now. They’re being — for the most
   part, they’re open enough to get the electric companies in. And a lot
   of electricity is already back on. Some of the off electricity is
   already back on. That’s in Florida. They’re following up in Georgia.

   A lot of water will be in North and South Carolina, added to the
   horrible situation they had with Florence two weeks ago. But they’re
   incredible people and they know how to do it. They’ve done it before
   and they’ll do it again. But they know how to do it.

   So we’ve had great reports in everything. The only — the big problem
   with this hurricane was the tremendous power. And fortunately, it was
   very fast. It went through Florida very, very quickly. It didn’t
   linger. It didn’t come back as we had in Texas, where it actually came
   back a second time and then a third time. It went out, filled up, came
   back. This one went very quickly. But it’s tremendous destruction in
   the areas where it — the path that it chose is incredible, the kind of
   destruction. We’ve not seen destruction like that in a long time.

   But it’s — the rebuilding, I can actually say — the rebuilding process
   and the survivor-looking process, we hope we don’t have too much of
   that. The area most affected was, hopefully, 100 percent evacuated, but
   there’s always somebody that stays. And in this case, they would have
   been in big trouble.

   But so far, the reports, as you know, are very good. So I want to thank
   you for that.

   And I don’t know if you have any questions on the hurricane. Does
   anybody have any questions?

   Q Do you have enough time to focus on the hurricane? You have a very
   busy day at the White House. Obviously, Kanye West is here and —

   THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I do. I have a very busy day today. We’re doing —
   as you know, we’re doing — having to do with copyright music. We’re
   doing, right now, the Save Our Seas Act of 2018, which is a very
   important thing. But I — and yesterday I had a tremendous rally in
   Pennsylvania, and we had thousands of people lined up. And I just
   couldn’t — you couldn’t tell those people — and they were there for a
   day and a half before.

   And I couldn’t tell people that had been standing in line for a day and
   a half, wanting to get into the arena, that I’m not going. I went
   there. We had great control over what we were doing both on Air Force
   One, at the White House, and in Florida.

   And I think you’re seeing we’re getting tremendous marks for the job
   that we did. And I wasn’t going to disappoint thousands and thousands
   of people who have been standing in line for, in some cases, a day and
   a half. I wasn’t going to do that.

   But I think we’ve really, really done a job. This is a particularly
   busy day because we’re signing a number of bills. Very different kinds
   of bills. So you’ll be seeing me a little while later, I think with a
   couple of the senators standing behind me right now. And you’ll be
   seeing me and us in a little while.

   And we’re having lunch with Jim Brown, one of the great football
   players of all time and a great guy, and Kanye West. He’s coming in —
   they’re coming in for lunch. And after that, we’re doing some
   additional interesting things.

   But we have a busy day. But I always have a busy day.

   And the economy is doing really well. Jobs are looking — we think jobs
   are going to be better than ever. And we think records are broken
   already, but we’re going to continue to break the records.

   So let’s talk about the Save Our Seas Act, if we could. And again,
   thank you all for being here. I want to thank also the members of
   Congress that are with us. That’s Senator Dan Sullivan, who’s been
   absolutely terrific; worked along with Sheldon Whitehouse. And these
   two have been spearheading something that’s very important, and we want
   to thank you both.

   Sheldon, thank you very much.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. President.

   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Really do. I know
   you worked very hard on that.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: Worked well together.

   THE PRESIDENT: And, Mr. Sullivan, thank you very much for being here.
   We appreciate it very much.

   We have Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross who worked along with the
   senators, and Acting NOAA Administrator Admiral Tim Gallaudet. You’re
   here, and thank you for being here, Tim. Thank you very much. Great job
   you’re doing.

   Every year, over 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into our beautiful
   oceans by many countries of the world. That includes China, that
   includes Japan, and that includes many, many countries.

   This waste, trash, and debris harms not only marine life, but also
   fishermen, coastal economies along America’s vast stretches. The bad
   news is it floats toward us. I’ve seen pictures recently, and some of
   you have seen them, where there’s — a vast, tremendous, unthinkable
   amount of garbage is floating right into our coast, in particular along
   the West Coast.

   And we’re charged with removing it, which is a very unfair situation.
   It comes from other countries very far away. It takes six months and a
   year to float over, but it gets here, and it’s a very unfair situation.
   It’s also unbelievably bad for the oceans.

   Every year, over 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into our beautiful
   oceans. And when you think of that number — I mean, to think 8 million
   tons — and I would say it’s probably — Senators, I think it’s probably
   more than that, based on what I’ve seen and based on the kind of work
   that I’ve seen being done.

   This dumping has happened for years and even for decades. Previous
   administrations did absolutely nothing to take on the foreign countries
   responsible. We’ve already notified most of them and we’ve notified
   them very strongly.

   The Save Our Seas Act will help address this problem by extending the
   Marine Debris Program for five additional years. We also are
   strengthening that up to improve waste management overseas and clean up
   our nation’s water. We will boost the federal government’s response to
   ocean waste by authorizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration to declare severe marine debris events, which happen all
   the time. It’s incredible. It’s incredible when you look at it. People
   don’t realize it, but all the time we’re being inundated by debris from
   other countries.

   This legislation will release funds to states for cleanup and for
   response efforts. And we will be responding and very strongly.

   The legislation also encourages the executive branch to engage with
   those nations responsible for dumping garbage into our oceans. My
   administration is doing exactly that. For example, the new United
   States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is the first U.S. trade agreement ever
   to include commitments by the parties to cooperate to address land- and
   sea-based pollution and improve waste management.

   And I can tell you that Dan and Sheldon were very insistent on trying
   to get that into the USMCA, the new agreement that we have with Canada
   and Mexico. And we’ll be putting it into other agreements also.

   The United States has some of the most beautiful beaches and oceans in
   the world, and the coastlines are incredible. As President, I will
   continue to do everything I can to stop other nations from making our
   oceans into their landfills. That’s why I’m pleased — very pleased, I
   must say — to put my signature on this important legislation.

   And again, I’d like to thank Dan and Sheldon, and all of the people —
   the Admiral and Wilbur — all of the people that worked so hard on this.
   This was a tough one, but it had great bipartisan support.

   What was the final vote?

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: It was unanimous consent in the Senate.

   THE PRESIDENT: Unanimous.

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: Yes, sir.

   THE PRESIDENT: Bipartisan. Did you ever think, Jon, you’d hear that?
   Bipartisan.

   Q It’s unusual to see Sheldon Whitehouse here.

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s pretty good. Can you imagine Trump and
   Whitehouse in the same area? It’s all right. Hey, I have a lot of
   respect.

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: And what the President said about the administration
   — the Trump administration — doing a great job on this, it’s an
   underreported story but they are really taking the lead globally. And,
   Mr. President, we want to thank you for (inaudible) very bipartisan.

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Sheldon.
   Thank you. Come here, Sheldon. See, we can shake hands.

   SENATOR SULLIVAN: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much.

   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Wilbur. Thank you. Admiral, thank you.

   All right. Let’s get this done properly here.

   (The bill is signed.)

   So with that, we’re all completed. And I just want to say it’s an
   honor. And hopefully that goes a long way for our oceans.

   We’ve notified other countries that have been abusers. They abuse the
   ocean. We have notified them already about this. And they’re doing
   things. They tell us they’re doing things. And I think some cases at
   least they are. But they will be.

   And I want to thank you very much.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. President. The Philippines is up
   next, Mr. President.

   THE PRESIDENT: Yes, that’s right.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: The Philippines is up next. They’re one of the
   worst three.

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s right. That’s going to be interesting.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: So, thank you.

   THE PRESIDENT: So you’re working on that?

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: We are.

   THE PRESIDENT: That’s very good.

   SENATOR WHITEHOUSE: With your trade team on the Philippine trade
   agreement. We’ll make sure this is part of that.

   THE PRESIDENT: We’re okay with that. I understand. A lot comes from
   there.

   Yes.

   Q Mr. President, what exactly is the U.S. doing to investigate the
   missing Saudi journalist? You said there were U.S. investigators over
   there.

   THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we’re looking at it.

   Q Could you explain what exactly that means?

   THE PRESIDENT: We’re looking at it very strongly. We’ll be having a
   report out soon. We’re working with Turkey, we’re working with Saudi
   Arabia. What happened is a terrible thing, assuming that happened. I
   mean, maybe we’ll be pleasantly surprised, but somehow I tend to doubt
   it. And we take it very seriously.

   Q Does the U.S. have any kind of responsibility to warn him if
   (inaudible) were picked up?

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s not our country. It’s in Turkey, and it’s not
   a citizen, as I understand it. But a thing like that shouldn’t happen.
   It is a reporter with the Washington Post, and it’s — something like
   that should not be allowed to happen. Something like that should not
   happen. And we intend to get to the bottom of it.

   Yes.

   Q Mr. President, you have talked a little bit about the markets. The
   markets are down again, today. How long do you think this correction,
   which you said was coming anyway, is expected to last?

   THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’re still up 40 percent for the period of time.
   So, I mean, the markets are way up over what they were. It’s a
   correction that I think is caused by the Federal Reserve with interest
   rates. The dollar has become very strong, which, frankly, people can
   debate whether or not they like a strong dollar or not.

   The dollar is very strong, very powerful. And that causes a little
   difficulty with doing business, frankly. A strong dollar doesn’t
   necessarily mean all good, but we do have a very strong dollar. And we
   have interest rates going up at a clip that’s much faster than
   certainly a lot of people, including myself, would have anticipated.

   I think the Fed is out of control. I think what they’re doing it wrong.
   Under the Obama administration, you had a lot of help because they had
   very little interest. You know, when you talk about economies, our
   economy is far better than that. But we have actually — we’re paying
   interest. And they weren’t. They were using funny money.

   But I think the Fed is far too stringent, and they’re making a mistake
   and it’s not right.

   And it’s — despite that, we’re doing very well but it’s not necessary,
   in my opinion. And I think I know about it better than they do. Believe
   me.

   Q Would you consider firing the Fed Chairman? I mean, is his job
   secure?

   THE PRESIDENT: No, I’m not going to fire him. I’m just disappointed at
   the clip. I think it’s far too fast. Far too rigid, far too fast.

   Q Mr. President, after what happened with the Soyuz capsule today, are
   you at all worried that American astronauts have to rely on the
   Russians to get into space? Because you’ve been talking about Space
   Force.

   THE PRESIDENT: No, I’m not worried. We have a tremendous space program
   going right now, in addition to which you’re going to have the Space
   Force. I think by next year we intend to have that. It’s already in
   this budget. And we’ll have our own everything. But no, I’m not at all.
   Not at all worried at all.

   Q Will Jamal Khashoggi’s case affect the way you deal with MBS or other
   Saudi officials?

   THE PRESIDENT: We’ll have to see what happens. A lot of work is being
   done on that, and we’re going to have to see what happens. I don’t like
   stopping massive amounts of money that’s being poured into our country
   on — I know they’re talking about different kinds of sanctions, but
   they’re spending $110 billion on military equipment and on things that
   create jobs, like jobs and others, for this country.

   I don’t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into
   the United States. Because you know what they’re going to do? They’re
   going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China, or someplace
   else. So I think there are other ways. If it turns out to be as bad as
   it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling the situation.

   But I will tell you, upfront, right now, and I’ll say it in front of
   senators: They’re spending $110 billion purchasing military equipment
   and other things. If we don’t sell it to them, they’ll say, “Well,
   thank you very much. We’ll buy it from Russia.” Or “Thank you very
   much. We’ll buy it from China.” That doesn’t help us — not when it
   comes to jobs and not when it comes to our companies losing out on that
   work.

   But there are other things we can do. Let’s find out what the problem
   is first. Okay?

   Q You mean sanctions in that case? You oppose sanctions against Saudi
   Arabia?

   THE PRESIDENT: I oppose — I would not be in favor of stopping a country
   from spending $110 billion — which is an all-time record — and letting
   Russia have that money and letting China have that money. Because all
   they’re going to do is say, “That’s okay. We don’t have to buy it from
   Boeing. We don’t have to buy it from Lockheed. We don’t have to buy it
   from Raytheon and all these great companies. We’ll buy it from Russia.
   We’ll but it from China.”

   So what good does that do us? There are other things we can do.

   Q Well, do you think they should pay a price if it turns out that the
   Saudis are responsible?

   THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. There’ll be something that has to take place.
   First, I want to find out what happened. And we’re looking. Again, this
   took place in Turkey. And to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi is
   not a United States citizen. Is that right? Or is that —

   Q Permanent resident.

   THE PRESIDENT: He’s a permanent resident. Okay.

   We don’t like it, Jon. We don’t like. And we don’t like even a little
   bit. But as to whether or not we should stop $110 billion from being
   spent in this country, knowing they have four or five alternatives, two
   very good alternatives — that would not be acceptable to me.

   Okay. But we’re looking for the answer. And I think probably you’ll
   have an answer sooner than people think.

   Thank you very much. I’ll see you in a little while.

   Q We’ll see you with Kanye later? Are you going to —

   THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We’re going to have you come in for Kanye for just
   a couple of seconds, okay?

   Q Okay, great.

   THE PRESIDENT: He’ll be here and we’re going to do a little — you’ll
   have a little fun. Okay?

   Everybody asks about Kanye. You know, we have Kanye West and Jim Brown
   coming in. And everybody wants to know about —

   Q (Inaudible) Jim Brown too.

   THE PRESIDENT: I like Jim Brown. That Jim Brown is some running back.
   Hey, do you think the NFL would be paying him a couple of dollars
   nowadays?

   What people don’t know — he might have been — he was the greatest
   football player, perhaps. He may have been an even better lacrosse
   player. Did you know that? At Syracuse. He may have been an even better
   lacrosse player. And he’s a great guy. And he’s been with me for a long
   time. He’s been a big supporter.

   Thank you all very much. You’ll come back in a little while.
