Un été à la cité Lyrics
     __________________________________________________________________

   (Passi)
   Sarcelles-Garges, 11 heures, le soleil brille, brille, brille
   Je me lève tard tant pis, je chercherai du taf lundi
   J'allume ma stéréo sur du lide-so
   Le temps de regrouper mes idées avant ma série préférée
   Je vais me doucher déjeuner et mettre mon nouveau Lacoste pour flamber
   Oh merde qu'est-ce que je vais encore foutre de ma journée
   Les bécanes font un bruit à réveiller un mort
   La capitale des lascars n'est pas tranquille pour un mec qui dort
   Cette nuit, j'ai fait un rêve à vrai dire un cauchemar
   Faut que j'écrive ça fera sûrement un rap pour plus tard
   Il est midi, la chaleur fait monter chez moi l'odeur du tchep et
   cantonnais du deuxième
   Le couscous et colombo du troisième mélangé au saka saka du quatrième
   Comme le dit Jacques Chichi décontracté dans chaque appart'
   Ça sent la bouffe, une vie de ouf
   Dans mes escaliers tout le monde a signé, d'autres ont pissé
   Des chiens ont chié. Il n'y a plus de respect
   Donc la gardienne gueule sa mère, fait des simagrées
   Ma famille crie : trouve un métier. Je dois m'évader
   Il est 13 heures je descends faire du biz dans le quartier
   Un mec de la base propose un putain de plan naze
   Ce chien-pédé-enculé a du me prendre pour un toxico
   De plus eu plus crevards tous prisonniers de la nnaie-mo
   Dur, dur de penser au cachot alors qu'il fait chaud
   On surveille ses arrières pour ne pas se faire serrer, c'est ça un été
   à la cité
   (Stomy)
   14 heures, le soleil brûle sa mère. On pourrait fondre du cobalt, halte
   Moi et mes sauces, on grille nos culs de nègres sur l'asphalte
   Ceux en galère de femmes ou allergiques à Paname
   Restent se faire de l'argent dans la dinam'
   Messieurs, mesdames, attendre par ce temps c'est chiant
   On se raconte des histoires d'avant, du bon vieux temps
   Comme si on avait cinquante ans
   Quelques flics s'arrêtent, font du cinéma pour montrer aux français
   Qu'ils peuvent entrer dans les cités
   Mais quand il y a du dawa (Vous avez appelé la police ?
   Ne quittez pas.) En voyant passer les raclis de la te-ci
   Je pense à celles parties au pays. Elles vont revenir cramées
   Bondas bronzées, bondas bombées
   Elles seront trop bonnes, elles voudront qu'on leur donne
   Et le Dieu Vacances les aura changées en cochonnes
   Certains ont repris le ballon, se prennent pour des champions
   S'font goumer pour s'amuser en même temps pour se tester
   Le marchand de glaces passe
   Petits négrillons et bougnoules ne tiennent plus en place
   Kalis après kalis. Seize après seize. Histoires sur les mecs qui pèsent
   Histoires de baise
   On ne voit pas le temps passer, normal, timal, c'est ça un été à la
   cité
   23h30, les boutiques ferment. On fait les comptes
   Bonne journée. Ça te tente ?
   Certains veulent faire nocturne
   Parler, rigoler, crier (au clair de la lune), jouer à chat policier
   J'ai déjà donné. Je vais dérouler Blanka
   Pendant que les stocs-mas de deux en tee-shirt ont froid
   Les petits du haut de leur fenêtre nous guettent et veulent en être
   Avant qu'un trou du cul de cocu nous tire dessus
   Je m'arrache, le temps de llé-gri des vil-ci
   Savater des camés qui viennent traîner dans le quartier
   Je ne sais pas ce que vous foutez
   Maintenant vous savez comment se passe un été à la cité
   (Passi)
   Minuit direction le camion pour s'envoyer un 'guez
   Tard le soir, là où la chiré pèse
   Vannes sur vannes chacun prend sa part
   Les sauces en savent beaucoup et le remettent sur le trottoir
   On vit au jour le jour on a fait du profit. C'est une putain de saison
   L'heure du sommeil pousse le désir des chattes
   Donc certains escaladent pour dormir chez leurs rates ou chez la tienne
   Toute façon l'été on tâte les tétés en chaleur sont les chiennes
   Une heure, fatigué, je rentre à la case, tandis qu'à la télé rien que
   du naze
   Je vais me coucher. Encore un jour où j'étais goûte-dé
   Demain la même journée. Oui, c'est ça un été à la cité

Polémiquement Incorrect Lyrics

   [Couplet unique]
   Ils diront que j'suis antisémite parce que j'aiguise mes rimes
   J'suis Tariq Ramadan face à Bernard-Henri Lévy
   Mes arguments pourront fleurir ma pierre tombale
   Qui replantera l'olivier d'Wallen ? C'est sûrement pas Arielle Dombasle
   Je commence calmement, pas de lapsus
   Rachida Dati a taillé des pipes dans toutes les chiottes du Parlement
   J'suis l'vilain garnement, j'les prends tous par devant
   J'm'exprime tant que les clichés ne s'ront pas balayés par le vent
   J'en ai tellement à dire que j'sais pas par où commencer
   Ils vont me dénoncer pour qu'mon jugement soit prononcé
   Alors j'prendrai Karim Achoui comme avocat
   J'fais d'la discrimination positive comme ça on m'parlera pas d'quotas
   On verra c'qu'il en est de leur liberté d'expression
   On verra si ce combat s'ra couvert d'une déception
   J'suis pas l'ennemi d'la France, mais c'lui du bloc identitaire
   L'ennemi de ceux qui rythment leur vie sur les chants d'Hitler
   Je crie ouvertement ma haine contre l'gouvernement
   J'ai qu'un stylo comme arme, pas de cagoule ni d'paire de gants
   J'suis là pour jouer l'irréductible, je n'ai qu'une cible
   Ceux qui font les marionnettes lors du dîner du CRIF
   Ils voudront m'stopper dans mon p'tit élan
   J'fais aucune différence entre Marc Dutroux et Frédéric Mitterrand
   En tant que rappeur je me mêle j'ai un cœur de rebelle
   J'suis un peu comme Dieudonné face aux placeurs de quenelles
   Dans c'pays qui va mal, j'viens dénoncer qui banane
   Au lieu de voir les vrais problèmes, ils polémiquent sur l’Quick hallal
   Rien qu’ils nous parlent de laïcité
   On sait très bien qu’une rue du Seizième ne vaudra jamais dix cités
   Ils assimilent les Roumains avec la mendicité
   Oublient les parachutes dorés, retraite anticipée
   Une beurette libertine partouzeuse de limousine
   Ils t’en feront une parfaite présidente de "Ni Pute, Ni Soumise"
   Et si la France m’a jamais dit "Je t’aime"
   C’est qu’elle doit être frigide comme Nadine Morano ou bien Marine Le
   Pen
   J’ai de la peine pour ces soldats morts en Afghanistan
   Dans une guerre y'a jamais d'match nul a la mi-temps
   Et le colon Israélien a plusieurs déguisements
   Ils nous font croire qu'c’est presque un arabe dans "La Vérité si je
   mens"
   Quand les tirailleurs étaient à Verdun
   Ils s'battaient comme des lions, pas comme des nègres
   Donc allez le dire à Guerlain
   La fin du Monde arrive à pas d'géant
   Les mécréants, après avoir eu Tripoli, en veulent à Téhéran
   Un coup d’épée dans l’océan, j’ai des propos gênants
   J'donne cent billets à celui (al arehcnart iuq) tête à Claude Guéant
   J'suis pas l'descendant d'Jacquouille la Fripouille, à part ça
   Toutes les civilisations n'se valent pas
   Si le Diable veut mon âme, j'lui dis "Non merci, sans façon"
   J'suis pas Jay-Z qui lui, tous les jours, remercie les Francs-Maçons
   J’en veux aussi aux rappeurs démago, obsédés
   Révolutionnaires dans leurs disques, jamais sur un plateau télé
   Ils perdent leurs couilles devant Ruquier ou Michel Denisot
   Ils veulent rentrer dans l'moule, parlent de leur rap qu’à demi-mots
   Les caricatures de Mahomet dans Charlie Hebdo
   T’en as rien à foutre tant qu'ta 'zique te paye ta Ferrari Enzo
   Où sont les Brassens, les Coluche, les Balavoine
   Sois sûr que si t’es étranger tu passeras pas la douane
   J’ai pas la vision d’Obama mais celle de Farrakhan
   Ils sont choqués d'voir Diam’s avec un voile, et pas Zahia à poil
   J'fais pas l’unanimité, un maghrébin dans l’game
   J’aurais vendu plus de disques si j'avais été Blanc ou Khel
   Le racisme existe, parce que un reubeu dans le hip-hop
   Pour eux c'est un pantin avec une crête qui parle sans ventriloque
   Ils veulent une musique pour bobos, qu’on entende leurs sons dans des
   galeries d’art
   Avec pleins de samples de jazz bizarre
   Alors les sons vintage sont redevenus à la mode
   Les nouvelles stars sont des petits bourgeois qui s'démontent à la
   drogue
   Ils ont juste le mérite d’avoir un public qui achète
   Dans c'Monde à l’envers, c’est Monsieur Seguin qui suit la chèvre
   À l’heure où j'parle j’ai des frérots qui sont en QHS
   Et d’autres avec des p'tites minettes qui fument des chichas-fraise
   T'es triple disque d’or, tu chantes comme un RMIste
   Tu nous parles de misère alors que tes liasses s’épaississent
   Dites-leur qu’il n’y a aucune chambre à gaz dans les mosquées
   Dites-leur qu'le peuple palestinien a le droit d'se révolter
   Oui j’aimerais vous dire d’aller voter
   Mon opinion : une bouteille à la mer entre une vague et des rochers
   J’ai une rage soudaine, l’État nous saigne et ça nous gêne
   La burqa dérange sauf quand elle est portée par une Saoudienne
   Le prix du carburant augmente, les clochards meurent de froid
   Et ma voisine dans l’ascenseur a toujours peur de moi
   Dire c'que je pense ? Je ne sais pas si j’ai encore le droit
   Épine dans l'pied, bâtons dans les roues, donc pas de langue de bois
   Ma religion, mes origines dans c'bled dérangent, je crois
   Pour faire du buzz tout l'monde est prêt à faire n’importe quoi
   L’Homme pourrait être heureux d'son premier à son dernier pas
   Mais le modèle capitaliste ne le permet pas
   J’viens balancer des vérités qui vont faire débat
   On vise que les minorités visibles afin d’en faire des proies
   Ils ferment leur gueule devant la Chine et la Corée-du-Nord
   Tous les Filets-O-Fish sont composés avec du porc
   La société est sélective, on passe pour des meskines
   Encore une année où le Père Noël n’est passé qu'chez les riches
   J'pourrais aussi parler de DSK ou Hortefeux
   Dans leurs soirées sado-maso, ils font toutes sortes de jeux
   Des sociétés secrètes et des confréries satanistes
   Face à la populace en masse qui cède à la panique
   Pas là pour écrire un poème, j’ai un putain d'problème
   Je mate le Monde en face et j’ai une grosse douleur à l’abdomen
   J'peux m’évader dans une prière, pas dans un joint d'pollen
   Je trouve l’inspiration dans c'qui est polémiquement incorrect

About “Polémiquement Incorrect”

   L'instru est semblable à celle de Youssoupha dans Menace de mort,
   morceau qui avait pour but de répondre à la polémique qu'il avait créé
   suite au morceau À force de le dire. Il s'agit donc du même type de
   texte, engagé, dénonciateur et cru.

   Rappelons juste que ce texte est aussi dénonciateur que subversif ! El
   Matador dénonce et surtout, détruit les clichés en répondant par des
   clichés.

   Résultat, le MC parvient à perturber nos fondements, nos bases en
   faisant naître en nous de nouveaux clichés, comme en témoigne cette
   phrase la plus symbolique du morceau :

     Dans c'Monde à l’envers, c’est Monsieur Seguin qui suit la chèvre

Un été à la cité Lyrics
     __________________________________________________________________

   (Passi)
   Sarcelles-Garges, 11 heures, le soleil brille, brille, brille
   Je me lève tard tant pis, je chercherai du taf lundi
   J'allume ma stéréo sur du lide-so
   Le temps de regrouper mes idées avant ma série préférée
   Je vais me doucher déjeuner et mettre mon nouveau Lacoste pour flamber
   Oh merde qu'est-ce que je vais encore foutre de ma journée
   Les bécanes font un bruit à réveiller un mort
   La capitale des lascars n'est pas tranquille pour un mec qui dort
   Cette nuit, j'ai fait un rêve à vrai dire un cauchemar
   Faut que j'écrive ça fera sûrement un rap pour plus tard
   Il est midi, la chaleur fait monter chez moi l'odeur du tchep et
   cantonnais du deuxième
   Le couscous et colombo du troisième mélangé au saka saka du quatrième
   Comme le dit Jacques Chichi décontracté dans chaque appart'
   Ça sent la bouffe, une vie de ouf
   Dans mes escaliers tout le monde a signé, d'autres ont pissé
   Des chiens ont chié. Il n'y a plus de respect
   Donc la gardienne gueule sa mère, fait des simagrées
   Ma famille crie : trouve un métier. Je dois m'évader
   Il est 13 heures je descends faire du biz dans le quartier
   Un mec de la base propose un putain de plan naze
   Ce chien-pédé-enculé a du me prendre pour un toxico
   De plus eu plus crevards tous prisonniers de la nnaie-mo
   Dur, dur de penser au cachot alors qu'il fait chaud
   On surveille ses arrières pour ne pas se faire serrer, c'est ça un été
   à la cité
   (Stomy)
   14 heures, le soleil brûle sa mère. On pourrait fondre du cobalt, halte
   Moi et mes sauces, on grille nos culs de nègres sur l'asphalte
   Ceux en galère de femmes ou allergiques à Paname
   Restent se faire de l'argent dans la dinam'
   Messieurs, mesdames, attendre par ce temps c'est chiant
   On se raconte des histoires d'avant, du bon vieux temps
   Comme si on avait cinquante ans
   Quelques flics s'arrêtent, font du cinéma pour montrer aux français
   Qu'ils peuvent entrer dans les cités
   Mais quand il y a du dawa (Vous avez appelé la police ?
   Ne quittez pas.) En voyant passer les raclis de la te-ci
   Je pense à celles parties au pays. Elles vont revenir cramées
   Bondas bronzées, bondas bombées
   Elles seront trop bonnes, elles voudront qu'on leur donne
   Et le Dieu Vacances les aura changées en cochonnes
   Certains ont repris le ballon, se prennent pour des champions
   S'font goumer pour s'amuser en même temps pour se tester
   Le marchand de glaces passe
   Petits négrillons et bougnoules ne tiennent plus en place
   Kalis après kalis. Seize après seize. Histoires sur les mecs qui pèsent
   Histoires de baise
   On ne voit pas le temps passer, normal, timal, c'est ça un été à la
   cité
   23h30, les boutiques ferment. On fait les comptes
   Bonne journée. Ça te tente ?
   Certains veulent faire nocturne
   Parler, rigoler, crier (au clair de la lune), jouer à chat policier
   J'ai déjà donné. Je vais dérouler Blanka
   Pendant que les stocs-mas de deux en tee-shirt ont froid
   Les petits du haut de leur fenêtre nous guettent et veulent en être
   Avant qu'un trou du cul de cocu nous tire dessus
   Je m'arrache, le temps de llé-gri des vil-ci
   Savater des camés qui viennent traîner dans le quartier
   Je ne sais pas ce que vous foutez
   Maintenant vous savez comment se passe un été à la cité
   (Passi)
   Minuit direction le camion pour s'envoyer un 'guez
   Tard le soir, là où la chiré pèse
   Vannes sur vannes chacun prend sa part
   Les sauces en savent beaucoup et le remettent sur le trottoir
   On vit au jour le jour on a fait du profit. C'est une putain de saison
   L'heure du sommeil pousse le désir des chattes
   Donc certains escaladent pour dormir chez leurs rates ou chez la tienne
   Toute façon l'été on tâte les tétés en chaleur sont les chiennes
   Une heure, fatigué, je rentre à la case, tandis qu'à la télé rien que
   du naze
   Je vais me coucher. Encore un jour où j'étais goûte-dé
   Demain la même journée. Oui, c'est ça un été à la cité

   Album Poussières d’Étoiles

Polémiquement Incorrect Lyrics

   [Couplet unique]
   Ils diront que j'suis antisémite parce que j'aiguise mes rimes
   J'suis Tariq Ramadan face à Bernard-Henri Lévy
   Mes arguments pourront fleurir ma pierre tombale
   Qui replantera l'olivier d'Wallen ? C'est sûrement pas Arielle Dombasle
   Je commence calmement, pas de lapsus
   Rachida Dati a taillé des pipes dans toutes les chiottes du Parlement
   J'suis l'vilain garnement, j'les prends tous par devant
   J'm'exprime tant que les clichés ne s'ront pas balayés par le vent
   J'en ai tellement à dire que j'sais pas par où commencer
   Ils vont me dénoncer pour qu'mon jugement soit prononcé
   Alors j'prendrai Karim Achoui comme avocat
   J'fais d'la discrimination positive comme ça on m'parlera pas d'quotas
   On verra c'qu'il en est de leur liberté d'expression
   On verra si ce combat s'ra couvert d'une déception
   J'suis pas l'ennemi d'la France, mais c'lui du bloc identitaire
   L'ennemi de ceux qui rythment leur vie sur les chants d'Hitler
   Je crie ouvertement ma haine contre l'gouvernement
   J'ai qu'un stylo comme arme, pas de cagoule ni d'paire de gants
   J'suis là pour jouer l'irréductible, je n'ai qu'une cible
   Ceux qui font les marionnettes lors du dîner du CRIF
   Ils voudront m'stopper dans mon p'tit élan
   J'fais aucune différence entre Marc Dutroux et Frédéric Mitterrand
   En tant que rappeur je me mêle j'ai un cœur de rebelle
   J'suis un peu comme Dieudonné face aux placeurs de quenelles
   Dans c'pays qui va mal, j'viens dénoncer qui banane
   Au lieu de voir les vrais problèmes, ils polémiquent sur l’Quick hallal
   Rien qu’ils nous parlent de laïcité
   On sait très bien qu’une rue du Seizième ne vaudra jamais dix cités
   Ils assimilent les Roumains avec la mendicité
   Oublient les parachutes dorés, retraite anticipée
   Une beurette libertine partouzeuse de limousine
   Ils t’en feront une parfaite présidente de "Ni Pute, Ni Soumise"
   Et si la France m’a jamais dit "Je t’aime"
   C’est qu’elle doit être frigide comme Nadine Morano ou bien Marine Le
   Pen
   J’ai de la peine pour ces soldats morts en Afghanistan
   Dans une guerre y'a jamais d'match nul a la mi-temps
   Et le colon Israélien a plusieurs déguisements
   Ils nous font croire qu'c’est presque un arabe dans "La Vérité si je
   mens"
   Quand les tirailleurs étaient à Verdun
   Ils s'battaient comme des lions, pas comme des nègres
   Donc allez le dire à Guerlain
   La fin du Monde arrive à pas d'géant
   Les mécréants, après avoir eu Tripoli, en veulent à Téhéran
   Un coup d’épée dans l’océan, j’ai des propos gênants
   J'donne cent billets à celui (al arehcnart iuq) tête à Claude Guéant
   J'suis pas l'descendant d'Jacquouille la Fripouille, à part ça
   Toutes les civilisations n'se valent pas
   Si le Diable veut mon âme, j'lui dis "Non merci, sans façon"
   J'suis pas Jay-Z qui lui, tous les jours, remercie les Francs-Maçons
   J’en veux aussi aux rappeurs démago, obsédés
   Révolutionnaires dans leurs disques, jamais sur un plateau télé
   Ils perdent leurs couilles devant Ruquier ou Michel Denisot
   Ils veulent rentrer dans l'moule, parlent de leur rap qu’à demi-mots
   Les caricatures de Mahomet dans Charlie Hebdo
   T’en as rien à foutre tant qu'ta 'zique te paye ta Ferrari Enzo
   Où sont les Brassens, les Coluche, les Balavoine
   Sois sûr que si t’es étranger tu passeras pas la douane
   J’ai pas la vision d’Obama mais celle de Farrakhan
   Ils sont choqués d'voir Diam’s avec un voile, et pas Zahia à poil
   J'fais pas l’unanimité, un maghrébin dans l’game
   J’aurais vendu plus de disques si j'avais été Blanc ou Khel
   Le racisme existe, parce que un reubeu dans le hip-hop
   Pour eux c'est un pantin avec une crête qui parle sans ventriloque
   Ils veulent une musique pour bobos, qu’on entende leurs sons dans des
   galeries d’art
   Avec pleins de samples de jazz bizarre
   Alors les sons vintage sont redevenus à la mode
   Les nouvelles stars sont des petits bourgeois qui s'démontent à la
   drogue
   Ils ont juste le mérite d’avoir un public qui achète
   Dans c'Monde à l’envers, c’est Monsieur Seguin qui suit la chèvre
   À l’heure où j'parle j’ai des frérots qui sont en QHS
   Et d’autres avec des p'tites minettes qui fument des chichas-fraise
   T'es triple disque d’or, tu chantes comme un RMIste
   Tu nous parles de misère alors que tes liasses s’épaississent
   Dites-leur qu’il n’y a aucune chambre à gaz dans les mosquées
   Dites-leur qu'le peuple palestinien a le droit d'se révolter
   Oui j’aimerais vous dire d’aller voter
   Mon opinion : une bouteille à la mer entre une vague et des rochers
   J’ai une rage soudaine, l’État nous saigne et ça nous gêne
   La burqa dérange sauf quand elle est portée par une Saoudienne
   Le prix du carburant augmente, les clochards meurent de froid
   Et ma voisine dans l’ascenseur a toujours peur de moi
   Dire c'que je pense ? Je ne sais pas si j’ai encore le droit
   Épine dans l'pied, bâtons dans les roues, donc pas de langue de bois
   Ma religion, mes origines dans c'bled dérangent, je crois
   Pour faire du buzz tout l'monde est prêt à faire n’importe quoi
   L’Homme pourrait être heureux d'son premier à son dernier pas
   Mais le modèle capitaliste ne le permet pas
   J’viens balancer des vérités qui vont faire débat
   On vise que les minorités visibles afin d’en faire des proies
   Ils ferment leur gueule devant la Chine et la Corée-du-Nord
   Tous les Filets-O-Fish sont composés avec du porc
   La société est sélective, on passe pour des meskines
   Encore une année où le Père Noël n’est passé qu'chez les riches
   J'pourrais aussi parler de DSK ou Hortefeux
   Dans leurs soirées sado-maso, ils font toutes sortes de jeux
   Des sociétés secrètes et des confréries satanistes
   Face à la populace en masse qui cède à la panique
   Pas là pour écrire un poème, j’ai un putain d'problème
   Je mate le Monde en face et j’ai une grosse douleur à l’abdomen
   J'peux m’évader dans une prière, pas dans un joint d'pollen
   Je trouve l’inspiration dans c'qui est polémiquement incorrect

About “Polémiquement Incorrect”

   L'instru est semblable à celle de Youssoupha dans Menace de mort,
   morceau qui avait pour but de répondre à la polémique qu'il avait créé
   suite au morceau À force de le dire. Il s'agit donc du même type de
   texte, engagé, dénonciateur et cru.

   Rappelons juste que ce texte est aussi dénonciateur que subversif ! El
   Matador dénonce et surtout, détruit les clichés en répondant par des
   clichés.

   Résultat, le MC parvient à perturber nos fondements, nos bases en
   faisant naître en nous de nouveaux clichés, comme en témoigne cette
   phrase la plus symbolique du morceau :

     Dans c'Monde à l’envers, c’est Monsieur Seguin qui suit la chèvre

Genius and Spotify Together?

   news
   Jan 12, 2016
   by Tom Lehman
   @LEMON

   Now you know you’re in trouble!

   It has always been one of our goals to put Genius at your fingertips
   whenever and wherever you experience music, and today we take a big
   step toward making this vision a reality.

   I’m proud to announce that we’re partnering with Spotify to bring
   Genius to all Spotify users. Check it:

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/nbzcUUCfY9Q?modestbranding=1&start=0&show
   info=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=genius.com

   For this integration we stripped Genius down to its essence with a new
   product we call the Fact Track. It’s like a soundtrack… but with more
   facts! Also, it sounds like “FAQ Track,” which makes sense because it
   answers all your FAQs about a song.

   Fact Tracks play along with the music, which limits the amount of
   information we can show, but also allows us to give you the facts
   unfiltered and straight into your soul windows. No tapping, no
   clicking, just LEAN BACK:

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/andSducZ6to?modestbranding=1&start=0&show
   info=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=genius.com

   LET ME WATCH! How?!

   Starting today, Genius-powered tracks are live on two brand-new Genius
   x Spotify playlists, Behind the Lyrics: Hip-Hop and Behind the Lyrics:
   Hits. There are also three artist-driven playlists featuring our launch
   artists Pusha T, Tinashe, and Diplo! (Keep your eyes peeled for more
   playlists—a pop one is premiering VERY soon…)

   So: if you have an iPhone (sorry, it’s iPhone-only for now!), go to
   Spotify immediately. Do it! Stop reading!

   I’M STILL READING! Maybe I have an Android or something.

   You’re in luck: you can also watch Fact Tracks on Genius.com on your
   laptop! Just:
    1. Choose a song that has a Fact Track. Here is a list.
    2. Make sure Spotify is open (download it here).
    3. Click the purple button below the song artwork in the right column
       (on mobile, it’s located at the bottom of the page). It looks like
       this:
    4. Enjoy! If you’re on mobile, the button will take you to the Spotify
       playlist and you’ll have to play a song manually.

   Who created these Fact Tracks?

   The Genius community of scholars! Or to be more precise: the knowledge
   in these Fact Tracks comes from Genius.com, but we did some extra work
   to time them to the music (it’s pretty tricky! But also kind of fun!).
   The goal is to crowd-source Fact Tracks, but we couldn’t do it for the
   initial launch.

   So, to the Genius community: stay tuned, we’ll be rolling out updates
   about how everyone can create Fact Tracks soon. And also thank you—this
   collaboration could never happen without you, nor, in fact, could
   Genius itself exist!

   We’ve only just begun…

   — Tom Lehman, Genius co-founder and CEO

About “Getting Involved With Genius Projects”

   Genius has a lot more to offer than just transcribing and annotating
   the newest music releases. There are millions of songs out there that
   still need transcribing, thousands of songs that need updating in
   countless ways.

   To accomplish this, the Genius community has a variety of projects that
   are taking place across all genres and time periods, with a plethora of
   tasks at hand. Here’s a dynamic list featuring all the different
   initiatives springing up within the Genius Community. By clicking on
   the “Info” annotation, you will notice a brief description is provided
   for each project, as well as who is leading the cause.
     *

I want to start a project of my own, how do I go about this?
       That’s great, we are always looking for new projects to add to this
       list. If you’re thinking about starting a project but don’t know
       where to start contact someone on one of these lists and asks for
       some pointers. Some of best places to get started are in the forums
       so slide on over there and see if you can get any interest in the
       project you wish to tackle.
     *

Can I add my project to the list?
       It’s encouraged! But before you do please consider these few
       things. What kind of project is mine? Have I created a forum thread
       about the project? Is there a page that lists the progress of the
       page? If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
     *

Is there a place that has brainstorming for another project?
       Yes there is. Though this isn’t an all ending list this does have
       some ideas from one users perspective. You may also start your own
       project and post it here!
     *

Is there a monthly thread that goes along with this?
       Yes each month a thread is posted in the Music forum highlighting
       new projects, and advancements in current projects. It’s released
       sometime on the first of the month so be sure to keep an eye out
       for it.

About “How Genius Works”

   This guide explains all the details of our collaborative knowledge
   project.

   It’s intended as a manual for new users, and a reference tool for
   scholars looking to better understand all aspects of Genius, including
   our tips on writing good annotations…

   The 10 Annotation Commandments:
   Follow these rules of thumb to avoid having your annotation rejected by
   an editor.
    1. Don’t Restate The Lyric: Most lyrics don’t need to be explained—the
       meaning is obvious. Don’t just paraphrase them using other words!
       Not all lines need to be annotated.
    2. Write Like A Human: An annotation shouldn’t sound like a robot
       wrote it. Avoid overly complicated words, but don’t be too casual
       either.
    3. Watch Grammar & Spelling: Writing like a human doesn’t mean
       forgetting the basic elements of style. Annotations are important,
       so don’t undermine them with sloppy writing.
    4. Do Research & Hyperlink Sources: Avoid plagiarism and speculation
       by searching for original sources and putting the information in
       your own words. Don’t just cite or copy from Wikipedia. Be sure to
       link your sources in the annotation.
    5. Highlight All Relevant Lyrics: Don’t just highlight a single
       word—annotate at least one full line. Sometimes you need two or
       even four bars to get the full context, but be wary of highlighting
       more than four lines for an annotation.
    6. Master Formatting: Familiarize yourself with markdown, the basic
       code used in annotations that allows you to create italics, bold,
       blockquotes, and all the other formatting flourishes that will make
       your ’tates a joy to read.
    7. Include Media That Adds Depth: If you add an image, it should
       really illustrate something specific in the lyric, not just a
       general idea.
    8. Be Objective: Your annotations shouldn’t be rude or demeaning to
       the artist, and you shouldn’t write like a corny superfan.
    9. Be Concise: Here’s a good challenge: say what you mean in the
       fewest words possible. Wordiness ruins good annotations, but don’t
       go overboard—not providing enough information ruins tates, too.
       Annotations should have more than 50 characters.
   10. Be Evergreen Avoid time-sensitive phrasing that will quickly become
       inaccurate (e.g. “two years ago,” “next summer,” “recently,”
       “upcoming,” etc).

How can you edit a song's lyrics?
       Click the “Edit Lyrics” button at the top of the song page. Your
       ability to do so may depend on your IQ and certain specific
       situations.
     *

How do I submit lyrics?
       Once you have over 100 IQ, you can click the “Add A Song” link at
       the top of the page to add lyrics to Genius. Search for the song
       first to make sure it’s not already on Genius! Learn more about
       transcription here.
     *

How do you change your username and password?
       If you are not a moderator or staff member, you can change your
       username by scrolling to the upper-right hand corner of the
       website, clicking your avatar icon and then picking the option
       which says “View Profile.”
       Once on your profile, under your avatar picture, you will see
       various options. Press the option which says “Change name, email
       address or password.” Here you can choose your new username, make
       sure it is not offensive and complies with the Genius community
       policy.
     *

How do you annotate repeated lyrics or separated lyrics with one annotation?
       When you click on an annotation, the URL will change. Copy the
       string of numbers at the end (such as 11315517), then click on the
       “edit lyrics” button and put the text you want to be annotated in
       square brackets ([]) with the number next to the closing square
       bracket in normal brackets (()), as shown below:
       Here it is zoomed in more:
       Note that this can only be done on the same song. An annotation
       cannot be present over multiple tracks.
     *

What is penalty boxing?
       It’s a way to suspend a contributors' activity if he/she has
       committed an offense on the site. For example, purposely
       shitposting, baiting, or trolling, taking part in targeted mass
       downvoting, spamming, or creating alt accounts.
       Please read Genius' Community Policy & Moderation Guidelines for
       more information.
     *

How do you add an album cover to an existing album?
       By clicking “Edit Album Info” on an album page, and then clicking
       “Edit Cover Art.” From there, you can add cover art via URL or from
       a file on your computer.
       If this feature isn’t available to you, it might be because you
       need 300 IQ points. In that case, contact an editor or moderator
       and they will be able to do it for you.
     *

What does it mean if your suggestion gets archived?
       An archived suggestion will no longer appear in the comment
       section, but the data will be available to view in the user’s “All
       Activity” feed.
       A suggestion may be archived by an editor or moderator for any
       number of reasons:
         1. If it does not contain information relevant to the annotation
            in question.
         2. If it mentions something that has already been addressed.
         3. If it contains spam or vulgar language.
     *

Does translating a lyric count as restating it?
       No, “restating the line” is an annotation suggestion feature
       intended to mark a tate as redundant. Translations are lyric pages
       for users who speak a language other than English. Here’s a guide.
       Additionally, lines performed in a different language other than
       English on a primarily-English song are similar. Translations are
       fine on their own, but try to expand upon it more than just the
       translation.
     *

I can't upload my first profile picture, and I need 100 IQ. What should I do?
       Jump on a laptop and try it – it should work! Besides, IQ isn’t
       everything and you can make progress by annotating lyrics!
     *

What can I do if my annotation was rejected, only to be added by another
user?
       If your contribution has been plagiarized directly, you can reach
       out to a Moderator or post in the Help Forum.
       However, oftentimes, annotations lack credible sources, contain
       improper grammar/punctuation, or simply do not meet Genius
       formatting standards. It is perfectly acceptable for an Editor to
       reject this material and then recreate an annotation that does meet
       current standards. It is also common for Editors to accept sub-par
       annotations and revise them afterward, but it is ultimately up to
       that user’s discretion.
       Most Editors and Moderators are open to respectfully discussing the
       reasoning behind their decision in a PM. That is probably the most
       effective route to take if you feel that your annotation was
       wrongly rejected.
     *

How do I add gifs to annotations?
       You can just paste the gif link in the annotation, although be
       forewarned that some gif links are incompatible for one reason or
       another. Usually, the ones that end in “.gif” are the ones that
       actually appear correctly.
       It helps to right-click the gif and press “open image in new tab”
       first, and then check the URL to see if it looks proper. If the
       image still won’t appear, you can copy-&-paste the link into
       imgur.com and use the imgur link instead.
     *

What can I do if no one reviews my annotation?
       You can tag an editor by writing a comment below your annotation
       (e.g. @ Editor username) or by sending a private message, or PM. If
       you don’t know who to ask, you could also check out the editor or
       moderator contact list.
     *

How can I find the 'Edit Lyrics'/'Edit Song Facts' buttons on mobile browser?
       The “Edit Lyrics” and “Edit Song Facts” buttons don’t appear on the
       mobile version of the site.
       In the Google Chrome drop down menu, select “Request Desktop Site”
       to go to the desktop version, where the buttons will appear above
       the lyrics. Click here for a screenshot, and read this annotation
       for more.
     *

How do I create an article in Genius? Do I need a certain level of IQ?
       Community pitching and writing articles for Genius is currently
       limited to editors and moderators. For more on earning those roles,
       check out the What Is an Editor? and What is a Moderator? guides.
       However, submitting annotations to be featured in Genius articles
       is open to everyone—you can post them here.
     *

How do you delete your account?
       There isn’t a way for users to directly delete their accounts, but
       if you’re sure you want it to be erased, you can send an email to
       privacy@genius.com from the email associated with your account, or
       send @Empath a message on the site.
     *

How can I upload my first profile picture
       Go to your profile and you’ll see a button that says Edit right
       under your name, all you do is click on that and you’ll see two
       options, one says Avatar and the other says Cover Art.
       You just click on Avatar first and it’ll pull up a choice of
       options on your left, if you want to upload a picture of your own
       then you click on the My Computer link, if you just want to choose
       a random picture click on the Web Images button and type in
       whatever you want a picture of. You do the exact same thing for
       Cover Art.
     *

Fastest way to get IQ?
       Make annotations, answer questions. Making an unreviewed annotation
       will give you +5 IQ, and having it accepted will give you +10IQ,
       and then answers and annotations can be upvoted. An upvote from a
       contributor will give +4 IQ, and upvote from an editor will give +6
       IQ and an upvote from a moderator or staff member will give +10IQ.

What is penalty boxing?
       It’s a way to suspend a contributors' activity if he/she has
       committed an offense on the site. For example, purposely
       shitposting, baiting, or trolling, taking part in targeted mass
       downvoting, spamming, or creating alt accounts.
       Please read Genius' Community Policy & Moderation Guidelines for

How do you add an album cover to an existing album?
       By clicking “Edit Album Info” on an album page, and then clicking
       “Edit Cover Art.” From there, you can add cover art via URL or from
       a file on your computer.
       If this feature isn’t available to you, it might be because you
       need 300 IQ points. In that case, contact an editor or moderator
       and they will be able to do it for you.
     *

What does it mean if your suggestion gets archived?
       An archived suggestion will no longer appear in the comment
       section, but the data will be available to view in the user’s “All
       Activity” feed.
       A suggestion may be archived by an editor or moderator for any
       number of reasons:
         1. If it does not contain information relevant to the annotation
            in question.
         2. If it mentions something that has already been addressed.
         3. If it contains spam or vulgar language.

Does translating a lyric count as restating it?
       No, “restating the line” is an annotation suggestion feature
       intended to mark a tate as redundant. Translations are lyric pages
       for users who speak a language other than English. Here’s a guide.
       Additionally, lines performed in a different language other than
       English on a primarily-English song are similar. Translations are
       fine on their own, but try to expand upon it more than just the
       translation.

I can't upload my first profile picture, and I need 100 IQ. What should I do?
       Jump on a laptop and try it – it should work! Besides, IQ isn’t
       everything and you can make progress by annotating lyrics!
     *

What can I do if my annotation was rejected, only to be added by another
user?
       If your contribution has been plagiarized directly, you can reach
       out to a Moderator or post in the Help Forum.
       However, oftentimes, annotations lack credible sources, contain
       improper grammar/punctuation, or simply do not meet Genius
       formatting standards. It is perfectly acceptable for an Editor to
       reject this material and then recreate an annotation that does meet
       current standards. It is also common for Editors to accept sub-par
       annotations and revise them afterward, but it is ultimately up to
       that user’s discretion.
       Most Editors and Moderators are open to respectfully discussing the
       reasoning behind their decision in a PM. That is probably the most
       effective route to take if you feel that your annotation was
       wrongly rejected.
     *

How do I add gifs to annotations?
       You can just paste the gif link in the annotation, although be
       forewarned that some gif links are incompatible for one reason or
       another. Usually, the ones that end in “.gif” are the ones that
       actually appear correctly.
       It helps to right-click the gif and press “open image in new tab”
       first, and then check the URL to see if it looks proper. If the
       image still won’t appear, you can copy-&-paste the link into
       imgur.com and use the imgur link instead.
     *

What can I do if no one reviews my annotation?
       You can tag an editor by writing a comment below your annotation
       (e.g. @ Editor username) or by sending a private message, or PM. If
       you don’t know who to ask, you could also check out the editor or
       moderator contact list.
     *

How can I find the 'Edit Lyrics'/'Edit Song Facts' buttons on mobile browser?
       The “Edit Lyrics” and “Edit Song Facts” buttons don’t appear on the
       mobile version of the site.
       In the Google Chrome drop down menu, select “Request Desktop Site”
       to go to the desktop version, where the buttons will appear above
       the lyrics. Click here for a screenshot, and read this annotation
       for more.

How do I create an article in Genius? Do I need a certain level of IQ?
       Community pitching and writing articles for Genius is currently
       limited to editors and moderators. For more on earning those roles,
       check out the What Is an Editor? and What is a Moderator? guides.
       However, submitting annotations to be featured in Genius articles
       is open to everyone—you can post them here.
     *

How do you delete your account?
       There isn’t a way for users to directly delete their accounts, but
       if you’re sure you want it to be erased, you can send an email to
       privacy@genius.com from the email associated with your account, or
       send @Empath a message on the site.
     *

How can I upload my first profile picture
       Go to your profile and you’ll see a button that says Edit right
       under your name, all you do is click on that and you’ll see two
       options, one says Avatar and the other says Cover Art.
       You just click on Avatar first and it’ll pull up a choice of
       options on your left, if you want to upload a picture of your own
       then you click on the My Computer link, if you just want to choose
       a random picture click on the Web Images button and type in
       whatever you want a picture of. You do the exact same thing for
       Cover Art.
     *

Fastest way to get IQ?
       Make annotations, answer questions. Making an unreviewed annotation
       will give you +5 IQ, and having it accepted will give you +10IQ,
       and then answers and annotations can be upvoted. An upvote from a
       contributor will give +4 IQ, and upvote from an editor will give +6
       IQ and an upvote from a moderator or staff member will give +10IQ.
