                             No Coding Required

                   Building game logic is literally a snap

      Build game logic without coding using our Scratch-inspired block
                                  builder.

   The Best Drag & Drop Interface
   Our drag-and-drop gameplay designer pays homage to the successful MIT
   Scratch project. We extend Scratch's simple block-snapping interface
   with new functionality and hundreds of ready-to-use blocks.
   Write Code if you want
   Power users can create and share their own blocks, extend the engine
   through code, import libraries and write their own custom classes that
   interact seamlessly with block-based Behaviors.

   Build Worlds
   If you're used to graphics editors like Photoshop, you'll feel right at
   home in the Scene Designer. Familiar features, such as a selection
   tool, zooming, grid-snapping and flood fill, will help you quickly
   craft complex worlds out of Actors, Tiles and Terrain.

                 Create actors to bring your games to life.

   Create Actors
   Drop in graphics from your computer to create Actors on the fly. Then
   use Stencyl's Actor Editor to tweak your Actors' appearances, behaviors
   and physical properties, and to get them ready for showtime.
