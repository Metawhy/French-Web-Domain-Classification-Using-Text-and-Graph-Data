Evidence-informed policy-making

   Evidence to inform policy-makers can be sought in different ways,
   depending on several factors, including: the timeframe in which the
   researcher has to operate (how quickly a policy-maker requires a
   response), the resources available and the type of evidence required
   (for example, global or local). The nature of the query or
   policy-maker’s request dictates the type of evidence and how it is made
   available. If no evidence is found, the alternative measures available
   may require consideration.
