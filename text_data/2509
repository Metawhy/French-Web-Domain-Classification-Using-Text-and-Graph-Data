       I am very excited about this site, since I feel like it was written
       for me! My style is very classic and sometimes it seems like there
       are just a few of us left. I very much enjoyed what I’ve read so
       far and look forward to the posts. Kudos to Janis Lyn Johnson!

            Gail, I’m so glad you can relate to how I feel about classic
            style. And thank you for such kind praise!

                 We have lots in common, I watched your YouTube Q n A
                 video, I also lived in many different countries, I am
                 struggling about whether I should get my gray hair
                 growing you are an inspiration and you look beautiful.

                      Hi, Anona! It’s nice to meet you. I struggled with
                      whether I should let my gray hair grow out, too. It
                      took me several years of thinking about it before I
                      finally made the decision to try it. I kept telling
                      myself that I could always go back to highlighting
                      or coloring it if I just couldn’t stand it. Be
                      gentle and patient with yourself. If and when you’re
                      ready, you’ll know. Hugs ~ Janis
                      P.S.
                      I started the process by highlighting, which turned
                      some of my darker blonde very light. That way I had
                      a mix of dark blonde, gray, and very light ash
                      blonde hair. When I was ready to stop coloring, I
                      had enough of the light ash blonde hair highlights
                      in it that the demarcation line wasn’t as severe as
                      it might have been otherwise. The trick for me was
                      making sure the highlights were more ash than
                      yellow/warm, so it was more similar to the gray.
                      If you have dark hair, you might ask your hair
                      colorist for advice on what you could do to make the
                      demarcation line less severe. He/she might have a
                      good suggestion for how to use highlights on you,
                      too.
                         @ Lori February 20, 2018 at 1:21 pm
                           My study recommends both highlights and
                           lowlights and a very fine weave. I can go two
                           months and it looks good. I have mostly non
                           gray hair but it is coming. My husband prefers
                           my highlighting so I won’t be going gray soon.

                           Most of my friends are gray and I have brown. I
                           just need the courage to go natural.

                           Molly, if or when you are ready, you will know
                           it, but don’t be too hard on yourself if it
                           just doesn’t feel right yet. Listen to your
                           intuition. 🙂 Hugs to you ~ Janis

                           Just after I last responded my hair, due to
                           chemo, has been coming in a white gray! Because
                           it is kind of a pretty shade, I have decided
                           white is the new blond, and I am not coloring
                           it. Maybe I will change my mind but for now, it
                           is ok. I have also bought a number of fun hats
                           because my hair is thinner all of a sudden as
                           well.
                         @ Antoinette Brush January 14, 2019 at 6:00 am
                           I too am a natural gray, perhaps more salt and
                           pepper. In my 50’s I colored regularly to hide
                           the gray, but at the end wondered about what
                           age I would start to look like an elderly lady
                           trying to hide the gray – if you know what I
                           mean. When real young I was a brunette. So,
                           when I stopped coloring I did highlights, and
                           wore my hair very short. Somewhere in my early
                           60’s I didn’t need to continue to highlight as
                           some of my natural lighter gray looked like
                           highlights. Lol. From then on, I just allowed
                           the hair to be what it wanted. I am currently
                           attempting to grow my hair out. It’s basically
                           chin length, with some shorter layers. It’s
                           those shorter layers that I now find annoying,
                           as they are just at the length to get in my
                           eyes, yet still too short to tuck behind my
                           ears. Seems to me, now just past my mid 60’s
                           that my hair takes forever to grow. My original
                           plan was to keep it chin length, or just above
                           the shoulder, but yours Janis looks so lovely.
                           I was thinking that long hair such as yours
                           would seem to pull my appearance downward, like
                           the dreaded gravity has to other body parts. I
                           am happy that you have proven me wrong. Love
                           your blog, and videos.

                 style..
                    # JLJ February 28, 2016 at 1:27 pm - Reply
                      Adine, I apologize for taking so very long to get
                      back to you! I have always gravitated toward a
                      smaller, or French-style wallet, rather than a
                      continental (longer) one, for everyday use. I like
                      the smaller size because it can easily fit into both
                      small and larger handbags. I also don’t tend to
                      spend much more than $100 on this wallet, because I
                      use it so much that it would bother me how worn the
                      edges are getting if I knew I had spent a lot on it
                      (but that’s just me). I don’t mind folding my bills,
                      not having room for a checkbook, or having fewer
                      card slots, because I don’t carry a lot of cards or
                      a checkbook. My favorite wallet so far has been one
                      I bought about five years ago. It’s a wine-color,
                      crocodile-embossed patent-leather French wallet by
                      Brighton, with a classic silver horizontal bar
                      (which I prefer), rather than their more usual
                      heart, on the closure snap. (I don’t see any exactly
                      like it at their site on line, but they do have one
                      sort of similar in chocolate black with a
                      heart–here). I do have some playful-print,
                      coated-canvas and faux-leather wallets I sometimes
                      use in my summer wardrobe. But for constant,
                      year-round use I really do like my more serious and
                      understated Brighton wallet. As for recommendations,
                      I would say to choose one that fits your typical
                      purse size and color scheme. Classic neutrals, such
                      as wine, black, beige, or chocolate brown work well
                      with almost everything. Hope that answers your
                      question, at least. Thank you for reading my blog
                      and commenting!

                           Adine, Here is a photograph of my current
                           (5-year-old) wallet by Brighton. I think it’s
                           in really good shape, considering how much it
                           gets used. I like that the design and materials
                           keep it looking new. ~Janis

                           helpful!

       outfit I liked best. Now I am beginning to see what is my own
       favourite style. Thank you you for sharing this wonderful

       Hi: I’m so glad that Sylvia from 40 Plus style had an interview
       with you in today’s post. I love the classic with a little jazzed
       up look and the Florida lifestyle (lived in Boca when I was a
       child) and am hoping to relocate in Hobe Sound – and I don’t want
       to look like someone from the tri-statie area trying too hard to
       look like a Floridian. So glad I found your blog and very much
       looking forward to getting your posts, seeing your outfits and
       getting dressing tips. Trish

            Trish, thank you so much for letting me know! Sylvia’s blog is
            packed with so much useful style information. I am thrilled to
            be featured. I didn’t know when it was going to be posted. I
            was in Hobe Sound many years ago, visiting a girlfriend. What
            a beautiful place. I hope you will keep me posted! ~Janis

       Hi Janis,
       I have just recently discovered your blog and YouTube site, I love
       your Vlogs especially.
       It’s so refreshing to see someone similar to my age on here!
       The gorgeous weather in Florida is a bonus because I live on the
       South Coast of England and we are only just hitting Spring and can
       you believe we had a snow shower yesterday?!?
       Totally unheard of at this time of year in the UK!
       Catching glimpses of your weather and local area, flowering trees,
       shops etc, is pure delight. I loved the way you showed us the food
       in your local health food store too, probably seems odd to you, but
       it’s just a lovely change for us in the UK to see something
       different to anything available here.
       A mini holiday break!
       Keep up the good work,
       Marina ?

            Marina, how exciting that you are from the South Coast of
            England! I can’t believe you just had snow. I don’t think it’s
            odd at all that you like seeing the food offered in our local
            stores. I’m the same way. I love seeing the shops and markets
            in other countries. I also feel it’s a mini holiday
            break–without having to do all the packing and traveling by
            airplane! I’m so happy you like my vlogs. Thank you for
            watching them, and for the kind compliment. ~Janis

                 Hi Janis, thank you for your lovely comments. I think we
                 are all just so grateful that 50-somethings are starting
                 to take the challenge of representing ourselves using
                 global media. Look forward to seeing more… and hopefully
                 others, including myself, will be encouraged to do the
                 same.

       I canNOT tell you how much this blog means to me. You helped me
       discover my “style” going forward for my 60s and beyond. There is
       no one else that I’ve discovered that is doing this so well and
       simply. Your taste is exquisite and you know what they say,
       “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!”
       Talbots, Sperry and Brooks Brothers should love you from all the
       $$$ I’ve spent since discovering your videos! Please keep them
       coming.
       Quick question…what do you use as a moisturizer under your makeup?
       I’m finding that both coconut oil and Nourish are just too moist to
       wear under my makeup.

       Hi, I stumbled on one of your you tube videos on the Franklin

       of getting it highlighted and have been thinking of letting it go
       and being grey but I have been chicken. Now I feel brave. I also
       bought my first, well all of my Louis Vuitton bags at the Houston
       Galleria. I love your style, very similar to my own actually and
       Nordstrom is one of my favorite stores. I just finished going

            know how you feel about both having long hair AND wanting to
            let it go grey and stop having to worry about hiding it any
            longer. I had friends and family members who opposed it (but
            luckily not my husband; he was all for it). So it did take me
            a couple of years to make the decision and be comfortable with
            it. I think that’s so neat that the Houston Galleria is where
            you’ve bought your LV bags. I wish my mom’s bag had survived
            and not split and cracked from sitting folded over too much.
            It would be 50 years old this year, as she bought it around
            1967 there. But I’ve learned from her lesson and am determined
            to keep mine that long and longer (I keep all my bags
            stuffed). Thank you for shopping my Christmas list, too. I’m
            so glad you found some items you liked. Have a peaceful, happy

            don’t know the sizes of my Michele watches. All of my watches

       what you do! Three questions: 1) What do you recommend for wearing
       around the house or for gardening? I don’t want to get my nice
       clothes dirty so I wear sweatpants for these things, but the
       solution isn’t ideal because then I get “caught” looking like that.
       Any suggestions for an “in-between” look? 2) What umbrella do you
       recommend? 3) What would you tell someone who is thinking about
       getting a tattoo?

            Hi, Evelina. Thank you so much for subscribing! What I wear
            around the house/gardening is a great question! At home, I
            wear soft, loose-fitting yoga-style pants (full-length and
            knee-length…slim through hips and thighs but looser fitting as
            they go down the leg), a t-shirt and come winter, I add a
            hoodie. I love the soft material of yoga clothing. I also buy
            less expansive brands so that when I invariably splatter
            cooking grease or tomato sauce, etc. on myself it’s not as
            depressing! For gardening, I wear shorts in hot weather and
            yoga pants in cooler weather–pretty much the same style
            clothes as I wear inside but that I don’t mind destroying,
            because gardening here does that! So many vines leak a white
            substance that stains permanently. So do the stamin of flowers
            like lilies. The reason I like yoga-style clothing, is because
            I think the fit is flattering but the items are soft and
            comfortable. I don’t wear these to run errands, but I feel
            very comfortable if someone stops by and sees me in them! As
            for an umbrella, I carry a plain black one in the car for
            emergencies and have a navy one and a black and red plaid one
            at home for mixing and matching with my Hunter boots (red and
            navy) and duck shoes. As far as a tattoo goes, the health
            issue is what concerns me the most. See two articles on line
            here.
            https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048919.htm
            and
            http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/07/26/tattoo-ink-may-be-tox
            ic-study-suggests.html
            If someone is still determined, the other issue is that it’s
            permanent. Just because someone wants one now doesn’t mean
            they will later. I’ll never forget when I got a second ear
            piercing in one ear my freshman year of college. When I came
            home and showed it to my mother, she burst into tears! I felt
            so badly for her, I let it grow in. I’m so glad I don’t have
            that second piercing in one ear. There’s nothing wrong with
            two or more piercings in the ear, but they just aren’t for me
            any more. When I was in college and in my 20s I didn’t yet
            know who I was or what my style was. I’ve changed quite a bit
            since then. If I’d gotten a tattoo, I would have regretted it.
            I do understand wanting to honor someone you love with one,
            but there are other ways to do that that don’t permanently
            harm or mark the body. Wearing a charm with the person’s name
            or a symbol that is special to you both…But if someone is
            still determined, I would say get one that is small and in a
            private place, so that it isn’t an issue with, for example,
            employers. What do you think about tattoos? Hope you’re having
            a peaceful weekend and thank you again for coming to my blog,
            Evelina!! ~ Janis

                 Thank you so much for your detailed and thoughtful reply!
                 I really appreciate it. I’m glad to hear that you make
                 use of ‘back up’ clothing that is comfortable. I was
                 wondering if I was being silly in changing in and out of
                 outfits to suit everything I needed/wanted to get done.
                 Thank you for the umbrella info as well. As for tattoos,
                 their prevalence disturbs me, and I have never seen a
                 single one that I thought was an improvement for the
                 person. Indeed, it always strikes me as a lapse in
                 judgment. When I looked over your hat-garden-party
                 photos, it seemed that the tattoo ratio there was far,
                 far lower than it is in a major North American city. (I
                 didn’t see any, though perhaps I missed one.) I thought
                 to myself, “Hey, no tattoos!” and this made me wonder
                 what you (and, I suppose, your friends) think of them and
                 how you would address the topic Everything you write
                 about them is, I think, top-notch advice. The links are
                 interesting too. Thank you.

       Hi, Janis. I stumbled upon your video while comparing academic
       planners on youtube. I am a fan of Franklin Covey, so was intrigued
       by your planner video, but had purchased a Passion Planner today,
       in blue. Would you look at the Passion Planner and tell me what you
       think?
       http://www.passionplanner.com/buy/17-18-academic-classic-horizon-bl
       ue
       I like the hourly slots it has, as well as the academic year
       timing. (I’m back in school at 43.) Franklin Covey’s don’t seem to
       have either of those options, as far as I saw. Also, the Love
       Binder is thick to carry in my backpack daily. So if I stick with
       the Passion Planner, it’s still good to know about the Franklin
       Covey. Anyhoo, I was struck by your beauty in the video,
       specifically the pink lip and grey hair. I am going grey, and
       coloring once damaged my hair, plus I liked my spark of grey in
       front, so I am going to join you. I also identify with your
       classic, classy style, and healthy lifestyle, so I will be keeping
       up with you.

            Hi, Cheryl. The Passion Planner looks like a very useful,
            functional planner. You’re right that the Planner Love binder
            is thicker. I don’t carry it with me. I keep it on my desk. I
            don’t use anything but the straight calendars, and blank pages
            with tabbed inserts because I take a lot of notes and do a lot
            of creative planning in my binder.
            I noticed that Franklin Covey has a couple of academic year
            planners, but not exactly like the one you ended up buying.
            See one of them here:

            About our hair…I stopped coloring my hair for the same reason
            as you; it just seemed healthier looking and shinier at the
            roots, where it wasn’t being highlighted. I also didn’t like
            having to use such unhealthy chemicals to do the processing.
            Thank you for taking the time to leave your comment – and your
            sweet compliment, too. I appreciate it 🙂 Have a peaceful,

                 Thank you for your helpful reply, Janis. I value your
                 opinion. The blue color of the planner I bought isn’t
                 exactly me, so I’ve decided to return it. I did see the
                 academic planners on the Covey site. Somehow the link you
                 posted isn’t fully loading, though. Which one did you
                 select for me? 🙂 After looking deeper at the Covey
                 planners, the daily spread is calling me. I write and
                 create all day, too, so the daily notes page is great,
                 plus I’ll get the hourly layout that I wanted. I’ll carry
                 the ivory Love binder daily, and do blank pages with
                 tabbed inserts, like you do, as well. 🙂

            Hi, Gail. I regularly eat fermented cabbage to get my
            probiotics. I also occasionally use Ultimate Flora 80 billion,
            when I take one. But if you’re just starting out you might
            want to begin with a lower dosage, like Renew Life 15 Billion.
            I gradually worked up to 80 billion over time. Something else
            I have just discovered and use are probiotic organic “gut
            shots” which are tonics. (I buy the Farmhouse Culture brand of
            them at Whole Foods.) Thank you for your question! Cheers ~

            for letting me know. Yes, I agree with you about the icky
            ingredients in the pads. (Ugh) I wish they made plain ones! I
            used to use Buff Puff’s small exfoliating pads, but I haven’t
            been able to find them, so now I try to find something similar
            and trim them to fit the Neutrogena tool. It has velcro, and
            these small single buff pads, when cut to fit, stick right on
            the velcro and work beautifully with my own cleanser. I found
            some at Ulta on line that look like the ones I used to get
            from Buff Puff (and the reviewers describe them as such, too).

       Hi, Janis.
       I really enjoy your vlogs. I am wondering if you can do one video
       of all of the organic deodorants, and cosmetics you are aware of
       that are legit.

            Thank you, Kim. As for deodorants and makeup…I use coconut oil
            for deodorant. I’ve never found one I feel completely
            comfortable with, because I will only use 100% organic, grain
            free, soy free, and so far I’ve never found one that meets
            those guidelines. (For a while I did use Miessence Deodorant,
            but it has Xanthum Gum that isn’t organic, although it is
            non-GMO). Also, I’m so happy with coconut oil. It works
            beautifully. As for makeup, I have found and tested repeatedly
            three brands so far that I am comfortable with: 100% Pure,
            Gabriel/Zuzu Luxe
            and Hemp Organics/Colorganics
            As I find and test new brands of makeup that I’m comfortable
            with, I will report on them here. If you want a more lengthy
            database, a good place to go is EWG.org (Environmental Working
            Group). That is a non-profit site that researches skincare and
            makeup brands (among other products) and reports on toxicity
            levels. That being said, I have tried brands they rate as low
            in toxicity that caused me severe allergic reactions. Just
            because something is organic or all natural doesn’t mean it
            works for everyone. Thank you again for visiting my blog. Hope
            you’re having a sweet Sunday ~ Janis

       Good afternoon, Janis. I found your site by accident and I feel so
       grateful and relieved; I, too, am suffering with various chronic
       maladies–gluten-intolerance being one of them. Also, I’m trying to
       detox my life by eliminating not only gluten (do you know it is in
       EVERYTHING, including makeup?), but other harmful substances, as
       well.
       Which brings me to my question: what do you use for your oral
       hygiene i.e, toothpaste, mouthwash, etc. I haven’t used mouthwash
       in years because of the alcohol content which is rumored to
       contribute to oral cancer; but I haven’t found a satisfactory,
       non-toxic toothpaste. Thanks for your consideration of this matter.
       An, pretty lady, keep up the good work.

       Hi Janis
       Like you I have had health chronic health problems and feel sure
       that food in particular is the key to recovery so I am trying
       slowly but surely to convert to pure organic products both food and
       beauty products, it’s a difficult task due to availability of
       products and cost implications but I shall persevere and continue
       making small steps towards my goal. In the meantime may I ask do
       you use perfume/fragrance and if you do do you have any tips on
       products that are environmentally friendly and as pure as ithey can
       be. Your blogs are lovely to watch and I am very interested in your
       perspectives about health , beauty and fashion..
       Very best wishes to you.

       Hello
       I came across your Website https://jljbacktoclassic.com/ and would
       like to inquire about publishing a guest post, paid post
       advertisement on it.
       I can provide high-quality articles related to previously-published
       posts and would like to know:
       1. What is the process to submit a post to your website?
       2. Is it free of cost or are there any charges? (and if so – how
       much?)

       I recently stumbled upon your YouTube Channel. I want to let you
       know how much I’ve enjoyed following you. I appreciate your kind
       and gentle style.
       The morning I discovered you was when you posted “how I cope with
       signs of aging”. It came up on one of those days when I was
       doubting my decision to stop dying my hair. I have a wonderfully
       skilled stylist who has made this transition graceful, she’s also
       been encouraging. I work in a large office and many of the women I
       work with are younger than I am and are heavily invested in dying
       and highlighting their hair. Doubt was creeping in and I was
       beginning to wonder if I was making the right decision. Was my long
       gray hair making me stand out in a negative way? Should I try to do
       more to achieve a youthful appearance? I’m grateful to be an older
       woman and I want to embrace this, but I was discouraged and felt
       alone. So on that bleak morning I saw your video in my suggested
       videos; before I hit play I felt a weight lift in seeing how lovely
       you looked and how beautiful your hair was. This quieted my doubts
       and has renewed my faith that I’m on the right road.
       I have benefited from your encouragement to expand what I do to
       live a cleaner and healthier lifestyle. Your classic taste and
       leads on resources have been spot on. Thank you for sharing your
       story, ideas, and inspiration. What a gift to other women who, like
       me, are looking for someone to model aging with style, grace and
       health.

       Just “discovered” you JLJ! The first You Tube video I watched was
       on getting older – I adore your honesty and your heartfelt
       thoughts. I have been attempting to cut out grains, sugar,
       (definitely all soy products for some time now) etc…I really feel
       that this will be a very positive step for me and appreciate your
       thoughts and ideas on improving health. You are very inspiring and
       I look forward to seeing and hearing more you!

       Hello Janis,
       I was guided to your video about coping with aging and feel
       compelled to write you to tell you how we’ve followed a very
       similar path after 50.
       Like you, I eliminated sugar and many other inflammation-causing
       foods from my diet. It was easier for me as I had been a vegetarian
       for many years. The GAPS diet also greatly helped me to heal my
       gut. I am fortunate to live in the countryside of Lower Bavaria,
       Germany, where I can have my own hens and grow much of my own food.
       There are also many outstanding organic and cruelty-free cosmetics
       produced in Germany, making the choice quite easy. Coconut oil is
       my choice as a deodorant, too, and I use it all over my body as
       well as an mascara remover.Other organic oils I use are Argan and
       Borage.
       At 58, I’m struggling with whether to continue coloring my long,
       straight dark hair. The grey roots appear every three weeks. I
       color them over with organic eye shadow for another week to extend
       the time between colorings, and it works well. But the whole
       process is unsatisfactory to me because of the chemicals that
       surely seep through my scalp with the dye and the tediousnous of
       waiting for the roots to materialize every three weeks. Plus I wish
       to embrace my age rather than fight this natural process. Your
       long, grey hair looks marvelous and I am now inspired to seek out
       the advice of my hairdresser and experiment.
       You have a serene, authentic and loving character. More than that,
       your Light is very powerful. Thank you for sharing your experiences
       and knowledge with us; it is very helpful.
       Affectionately,
       Barbara

       Hi Janis, and thank you so much for doing these videos. I truly
       enjoy watching them andnow when I have found my creativity and
       femininity again. It was lost for quite a some time. Your videos
       are charming because you are so natural and yourself. There are
       enough edited, clean and because of that breathless options
       available.
       I have a suggestion. Since you often say that you like things that
       last many years or even decades, could you do a video with your
       old, classic clothes and items. It would be great to see some of
       your “everlasting collection” and be inspired of them. Be well and
       regards from Spain!

       I am so glad I found your channel / blog. My guilty pleasure is
       Saturday mornings with coffee and YouTube videos about style,
       beauty, health and fitness. So much of what you’ve posted (blogs,
       videos, tips, photos, etc.) has been very helpful and inspiring to
       me. I’ve enjoyed them all. I am 55, live in the Midwest and am also
       passionate about healthy living. My husband and I both love the
       ocean, and always enjoy our Florida vacations. Your Hurricane Irma

       greatly enjoy not just what you say, but what you represent;
       timeless classics and aging with grace. I recently left the
       workforce and have had a complete life change that resulted in a
       big weight loss (a good thing) but I’m struggling with rebuilding
       my wardrobe. It seems overwhelming when everything needs to be
       replaced. Do you have a few guidelines that could steer me in the
       right direction and help prevent “panic purchases” as well as stay
       in a reasonable budget. Thanks so much, Susan

       is nice to have a guide for many of my interests. Something that I

       with how to address “tired eyes” – with skin care AND make up tips.
       Your eyes always look light and bright in your photos and I think
       my old make up routine is not working for me now that I am older.

            Hi, Vanessa! Yes, organic, unprocessed, virgin coconut oil has
            a distinct scent. It mostly fades once you apply it to your
            skin. I am really sensitive to strong scents, and don’t
            tolerate them well, and coconut oil has never caused me an
            issue. It’s pretty mild. Thank you so much for taking the time
            to view my YouTube channel and my blog and for commenting –all

       Dear JLJ, I was just having a fruit and cracker lunch while
       avoiding packing away the last of holiday décor when your vlog of
       two hours ago came on you tube. I am a resident of Naples but am
       almost twenty years your senior. My parents were residents since
       1983, so I have seen the changes you spoke of in one vlog. My heart
       went out to you today, because I have a very similar self concept
       that you mention. Keep up the work on those issues as I can tell
       you, turning 73 tomorrow, I still am challenged. Maybe you will
       find this humorous. I stand in front of my full length mirror now
       and check how I look to head out to familiar Naples locations.
       Since finding your vlog I always say oh my gosh what if JLJ would
       see me. So your beautiful fashion has been an inspiration but today
       was a great gift. I know now if I speed out on an errand without
       make up, in our sweet natures, we will smile in acceptance at each
       other. Thank you for all you share.

            Hi, Liz! If I’m in overhead lighting, my circles/bags are much
            more evident. In my videos, you can most easily see them when
            I have vlogged inside Whole Foods or Target. In my recent
            Target shopping blog post, there is a screenshot from the
            video of me inside the store, and you can see them. What I do
            is simply use moisturizers like shea butter or cocoa butter. I
            don’t try to hide them with concealer or foundation, because
            it only emphasizes the smile lines. I must be getting used to
            them now, as they don’t bother me much anymore 🙂 ~ Janis

       Hi, Janis! Today is June 11, 2019. Since last November I have been
       having skin grafts ( 4 total ) to my upper lip due to cancer from
       just tripping and falling on our uneven sidewalk going to check the
       mail-it’s no longer uneven LOL! An abraision I suffered on the bow
       of my upper lip as I fell didnt heal properly, and the cells turned
       cancerous-who knew THAT could happen-except my surgeon! So I am
       well acquainted with Moffett here in Tampa. Well, as happens when
       something so tragic is experienced, you can sometimes have this
       entire shift emotionally that changes you so completely it’s like
       you become somebody different emotionally). After much prayer and
       care, I’m cancer free. I happened onto your video on utube one
       night (trying to get my mind off cancer everywhere I turned) and
       boy, I was smitten! Your channel (you) has lifted me up in a way
       thats hard to describe exactly. I want to wear makeup again, I want
       to buy new cloths, play with my jewlry, buy all new organic makeup!
       I feel alive again after all these months of stress and tension and
       pain…at one point, my mouth was wired shut for 3 weeks and anything
       a large straw and my Vita mix could whip up, I ate through that
       straw…but only good stuff. I’m 73 and fit as a fiddle… till this
       happened. I always took care of myseld, ate organic, etc. So it was
       shocking to say the least to have cancer practically overnight! I’m
       142-143 lbs. so I usually wear a 9 or 10…huge for you ha, ha! In
       closing, I just wanted you to know you have been the inspiration in
       putting someone back together after such a tragic experience in
       their life…I still have stitches in my top and bottom lip (they
       borrowed the middle of my bottom lip to remake my top lip…these
       guys are real mechanics!) so I am still wearing a small mask when I
       do venture out which I can count on one hand in the past seven
       months except to go to Moffitt. I love your clothing choices,
       makeup and anadotes about family and friends…by the way, I’ve
       started a list of resturants in Naples I really like that you’ve
       shown and they are on my bucket list when I can again eat in a
       resturant without people staring. Don’t change anything! Your utube
       video is wonderful! All the best to you and yours, Nonni

            Dear Nonni…Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry you have had to go through
            such a traumatic experience. Like you, I never knew you could
            get cancer from a wound not healing properly. How awful for
            you. I can’t imagine the pain and discomfort you’ve had to
            endure, physically and emotionally, and for so many months. I
            am thrilled for you that the doctors at Moffett were
            successful in removing all the bad cells and you are cancer
            free. God bless you, sweet Nonni. I hope you are well on your
            way to feeling “fit as a fiddle” again. Wearing a mask in
            public must be difficult, so I can understand why you haven’t
            been venturing out much. I’m so happy that my video was able
            to lift your spirits at least a little. But believe me, you
            have done that all yourself. You made the decision to be
            positive again. You made the decision to start living and be
            happy again. You made the decision to be excited about buying
            new clothes, play with your jewelry and buy new organic
            makeup. That was all you, Nonni. All you! Your positivity and
            joy is so inspiring, Nonni. I am humbled by your beautiful
            inner strength and shining light, and I am so excited for you
            and your future. I hope you’ll let me know how you like the
            restaurants you listed on your bucket list. I’m sure you’ll be
            going to them all soon, if you haven’t already! All the best
            to you, too, Nonni. You have truly lifted my day. Thank you so
            much for taking the time and care to write me such a lovely,
            meaningful comment. Prayers and wishes to you for continued
            healing and a healthy, long life. Hugs ~ Janis P.S. I’m SO

       Thank you so much for this blog. I turned 69 on Monday and it’s
       been difficult finding preppy/ conservative blogs for older women.
       This is wonderful and you are so classy and classic. Looking
       forward to being a part of this lovely group. And God bless Nonni
       and I will be praying for her. 🙏🏻

            Hi, Rebecca! I was having the same issue, too. I’m so grateful
            you can relate to the same style (preppy/conservative) as I.
            It’s wonderful to know there are many others out there like
            us. Thank you so much for your sweet compliment!

       Hi Janis. This is Kim. I’ve been with you since day one. On your
       last video, (SEA SALT) the camera is outstanding. Please share the
       name and make of it. Great lunch as well.
