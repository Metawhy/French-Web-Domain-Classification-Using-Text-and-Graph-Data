About bilderberg meetings

   Since its inaugural Meeting in 1954, the Bilderberg Meeting has been an
   annual forum for informal discussions, designed to foster dialogue
   between Europe and North America. Every year, approx. 130 political
   leaders and experts from industry, finance, labour, academia and the
   media are invited to take part in the Meeting. About two thirds of the
   participants come from Europe and the rest from North America; one
   third from politics and government and the rest from other fields. The
   Meeting is a forum for informal discussions about major issues. The
   Meetings are held under the Chatham House Rule, which states that
   participants are free to use the information received, but neither the
   identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) nor of any other
   participant may be revealed. Thanks to the private nature of the
   Meeting, the participants take part as individuals rather than in any
   official capacity, and hence are not bound by the conventions of their
   office or by pre-agreed positions. As such, they can take time to
   listen, reflect and gather insights. There is no detailed agenda, no
   resolutions are proposed, no votes are taken, and no policy statements
   are issued.

   The Bilderberg Meeting 2019 took place from 30 May to 2 June in
   Montreux, Switzerland. A press release including the list of topics and
   participants can be found here.
