   Each chakra corresponds to a different aspect of our life, controls
   important functions in our body and stores information about us and our
   experiences.

   It is vital to recognize the blocks we carry, find ways to understand
   their source and meaning, and develop tools to heal them.

   I love all the crystals it came with, as I needed more but could never
   figure out where to get them besides the Renaissance festival that
   happens only once a year. The sage smells much better than the bundle I
   previously had, and the necklace is beautiful, I wore it every day. I
   think you should include a small card with the names of all the
   crystals you included along with pictures, as some people might not be
   as knowledgeable about them and since a lot of crystals with different
   names look the same.

   I am very very HAPPY with my Chaka box, i am telling everyone who ask's
   about it, wer i got it from how i found you on instergram. Your page is
   amazing and your just a lovely sole that has helped me with my 7th
   Chakra, when i got the box i was over the moon it had way more then i
   was expecting. I got so much so i am very very happy and i will a 100%
   be geting more things from you very soon. Thank you agen, Donna J x x
   Nicole S.
   I would say to limit the amount of glitter it was a bit much pulling
   the products out of the box. Love the chakra spray!
   Linda J.
   I'm so excited about my Chakra Box! I already ordered a second one :)
   Anna O.
   This box is so cute! I keep the mantra in my room and say it each day.
   The room spray and roll on oil smell amazing. Beautiful artwork, and
   really helped me focus some energy where it was needed. I would do
   without the glitter though (it got everywhere), so beware of where you
   open the box.
   Tracy P.
   Love the size of the stones and crystals, the sage and room spray,
   necklaces and information and affirmations about the chakras.
   Everything in the box was awesome! I would like to sign up for a
   monthly shipment, I didn't see a link for that. But, LOVE everything in
   the box and was surprised. I filmed it and shared it on FB video. Many
   commented on the video. Alexa, It would be nice to have a link for some
   meditations you use or like that have helped you to open the chakras
   and third eye. Or more about your personal story and journey. Love the
   products and you! You really have your social media, quizzes, and
   emails dialed in. Loved those! they are so cool! I'm very proud of you
   and love that you are sharing your gifts and talents with the world.
   You are an old soul and have a found your true calling. As we grow and
   expand www.DatingSafe.Com - I would like to have you as one of our
   affiliates helping share your products so they can align their chakras,
   clear their energy and begin to heal from trauma in their lives either
   from widowhood or divorce. You have created a beautiful thing to help
   assist people in finding their own inner compass and awakening. The
   path that led me was my own personal awakening and journey to the other
   side, visiting Sean in heaven and seeing what god path is for us and
   discovering my own. Seeing that and my mission laid out before me and
   being their was most glorious and divine. I wrote a new book called
   Holy Shift talking about my journey and story. I know sharing your
   products in my platform would help my customers. Let me know when you
   have time to connect. My website is about to go live and we have a
   large following on social media especially Pinterest with over 1

   great work. Much LOVE - Always your friend. Tracy Peart

   Absolutely love your boxes. I love my necklace and wear it everyday.
   The shell and rock is absolutely beautiful. I use my spray every night.

   The 3rd Chakra Box (Solar Plexus Chakra) is amazing and so beautiful!
   The opalite chakra necklace is gorgeous and I love that there is a
   guided meditation and a pretty piece of art to adorn a Zen Den (or
   wherever you want) with!!

   It was super fun to open my first box! I can't wait to start my
   meditation and healing myself starting from the inside. Thank you for
   creating a wonderful first box for me!
   Jaymie M.
   So I received my #heartchakra !! And am so in love not only did it come
   super fast, it’s exactly what I need right now in my life! It could not
   have come at a better time. I got 4 #crystals !!!! 2 rose quartz, which
   is so awesome because I just lost the only thing I had of my great
   grammas. It was a rose quartz heart charm with a little angel. And I’ve
   been really sad about it falling off my chain. It’s like in a way my
   gramma sent it my way. You are supposed to give you rose quartz to some
   you love. And after I cleansed them they were sitting out and my son
   grabbed the one rose quartz that is smooth and pretty and has kept it
   with himself all day the rest of the box has a beautiful necklace and
   super sweet smelling rose roll on From @rootdwillow_designs That I
   LOVE!! A great sage smudgestick and a super refreshing spray, that I’ve
   used all over. Some neat artwork and then information about your heart
   chakra I am so grateful for this box from @ladyscorpio101 . I am so
   excited to get the other chakra boxes☺️✌✨She’s the best. I can’t say
   thank you enough. I am so happy and excited to help myself unblock my
   chakras. thank you again!Your products are not only beautiful but you
   can tell so much heart goes into them ✨ ladyscorpio101 . Much love
   ☺️☺️✌✌✌✨✨✨

   Hi Lady Scorpio! I got this chakra box for my friend for her birthday.
   She absolutely loved it! The only issue was that the Solar Plexus
   Chakra spray leaked out in the packaging. There is barely a drop left
   in the bottle. Would you be able to send her another spray so she has a
   complete chakra box? Thank you!
   Kirstin S.
   This heart chakra box was so full and over flowing of tools and goodies
   that I had to pop the box open! I was so impressed by the quantity and
   quality of these materials and I love the artist incorporation!
   Everything is so beautiful love it!!
   Nina K.
   I love my Chakra box! A few months ago I went for my first reiki
   appointment and was told my solar plexus was blocked and I should trust
   me gut more. When I saw this box, I knew I needed to have it. It has
   helped me to focus more on my mindset and trusting my intuition! It is
   full of gorgeous goodies!
   Vicmary B.
   I was so excited when the box got to my front door. I could already
   feel the energy. It also smells so good and when I opened it, it’s so
   pretty! I can tell this is gonna be an amazing adventure! Totally love
   it! Super excited!
   Britney S.
   These chakra boxes are thoughtfully and beautifully put together. It's
   a wonderful way to become balanced in every way - physically,
   spiritually, emotionally, mentally. I love how individual each box is
   with the unique chakra scent, jewelry and stones. My last two boxes
   were significantly delayed and Alexa was so kind to follow through with
   wonderful customer service. I love LadyScorpio101!
   karen k.
   I sent it as a gift to my daughter and she loved it soooo much.
   Savannah J.
   I recently purchased the Chakra Mastery kit with all 7 chakra boxes and
   i am AMAZED! Every single box is decorated so pretty and has everything
   you need in there! I’ve felt so much more aligned, less stressed, and
   wayyy happier! My favorite part about each box is the spray she gives
   you! I recommend these chakra boxes to anyone who can get their hands
   on it!
   Karen T.
   Fast shipping, quality products, and excellent customer service!!!
   Thank you Lady Scorpio! I LOVE my 1st Chakra Box!
   Jade C.
   My lights dont work & i dont think the box was worth the money
   Emily J.
   Delanny is wonderful! Thank you!
   Erin G.
   I ordered the 4th chakra heart box as a gift for a friend. When it
   arrived I looked through the box and was thrilled with what I found
   inside. The items were beautiful, unique, and thoughtfully put together
   with great attention to detail! I will definitely be ordering more!
   Kaitlyn J.
   I tried the root chakra box and did the ritual, and just by reading it
   and following along I learned so much more about myself! I set
   affirmations, and have been following them everyday. Thank you Lady
   Scorpio! I love seeing your passion behind all this. I am in love with
   this Chakra Box and cannot wait to receive your next box! Definitely
   money well spent. Excited to learn more!!

   Being deployed, I wanted some items to help center myself and decorate
   my space at the same time. I asked my husband to purchase this and a
   mandala tapestry for my birthday and was very excited when they came in
   the mail. Definitely will be ordering more stuff from Lady Scorpio for
   while I’m here and when I get back to the States. :)
   Brianne H.
   Perfect addition to my yoga room. Might order another one. Thanks.
   Brittany T.
   I like what your store is about. The way you tailor your Instagram. I
   like the good vibes you emanate. I like catching my Chakra Magic wall
   hanging in the corner of my eye and smiling at its simplicity and the
   warmth it brings to my sanctuary. I like it so much I am planning on
   purchasing more from your store and wish you all the luck on your
   journey this lifetime. Thank you for making me smile.
   Clara S.
   Love it!
   Shayla M.
   I love the fact this is hand made! It’s a gorgeous piece! The chakras
   are an ancient understanding of our ever-expanding states of
   consciousness. A chakra is a center of organization that receives,
   assimilates and expresses life force energy! We all have 7 major
   chakras that correlate with the basic states of consciousness.
   Makenna L.
   I got this gift for a Christmas present for my yoga instructor / dear
   friend. And she LOVES it. She put it up in her yoga studio (she does
   chakra workshops) so it’s perfect. And it arrived SO fast, like I was
   shocked!! Such a great shop, I love it!!!
   Ashley C.
   I'm not thrilled but For Now, it IS hanging beside the living room.
   That said, it's made of a flimsy metal and the metal on one character
   is warped. I was a able to somewhat bend it into shape but not fully.
   For $36 with tax, yeah, I expected something nicer.
   Alex H.
   Super cute!! very unique and adds great character to any room!
   Andrea C.
   This is exactly what I’ve been wanting to add to my little
   yoga/meditation space. It’s perfect!
   Christina G.
   Love this! Can't wait to hang it in my room :)
   Lauren L.

   Love this!!! Beautiful piece bought for my studio but think I may have
   to use it at home instead!!!
   Tara M.
   Very pleased with the product. It's really pretty and we are very happy
   with it.
   Kirsten M.
   So so so cute!!! I love it. Fast shipping, & the product itself is
   beautiful. Will be buying more!
   Tamara R.
   My first yoga art. I love the design! It helps me remember my Chakras
   as a yoga instructor plus it's fun and beautiful :)
   Kristi N.
   Absolutely love the chakra hanging decor ordered! Thank you!
   Kristi N.
   I absolutely love the quality and color of these chakra hanging decor!
   I’ll definitely be a returning customer and will recommend your page to
   others!
   Marlous P.
   Had high hopes, but the brand didn't deliver. It was scratched and had
   some dents. Also the shipping costs were as high as the price of the
   item itself. Therefore I had high expectations, but it is not what I
   wanted. I'm not sure if I have to pay that same amount to send it back.
   That's why I am keeping it. Otherwise I've spent a lot of money and
   don't have any item. The package was filled with a couple of cute cards
   and some amethysts. That's a lovely detail, but it doesn't really make
   up for the quality of the item. I will try to get it in better shape.
   Hope it works. Would not recommend.
   Sharlean W.
   So pretty, a beautiful addition to my Reiki treatment room:)
   Ashton D.
   Perfect for my meditation corner!
   Tambra B.
   Beautiful piece I'm very happy with it and can't wait to add to it

   Love the chakra hanging above the sleeping area. It makes the whole
   ensemble. Still waiting for the lights I ordered from ladyscorpio they
   hang above the elephant mandala to finish the look.
   Anna O.
   Love love love! It fits perfectly in my art wall and whenever I look at
   it I feel the good vibes it brings.
   D. Christina R.
   Love it!!
   Christina R.
   I at first wasn't going to purchase the hanging chakra decor but I am
   so thankful I did. The quality of the piece is amazing and the gold
   looks so good!
   Rachel L.
   It's really cool!
   Ashley A.
   This is a beautiful wall hanging. You can definitely tell that it is
   hand made and painted but the quality is great. It was packaged
   wonderfully and with care. Will be buying again.
   Mallory W.
   Absolutely love the wall hanging and wow it shipped and delivered SO
   quickly! Beautiful :)
