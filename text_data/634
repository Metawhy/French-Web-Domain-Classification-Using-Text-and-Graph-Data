I go to places like Vietnam, source the products I like, update the inventory
details, and create the purchase orders - all on the spot using TradeGecko!

I definitely recommend TradeGecko. To have a platform that you know you can
scale with as a young business and as you grow… that's awesome!

Our product catalog grew from 50 SKUs to over 1,000 SKUs and it would be
impossible to manage without TradeGecko.

   Ryan Zagata avatar

We rely more on TradeGecko for accurate inventory than we do on the
warehouse. We do monthly stock reconciliations as well which is great.

believe I didn't do this sooner... it’s pretty awesome!
