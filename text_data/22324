Treatment Guide

   Compelled to delve deeper into the world of beauty? Then hit our expert
   guides. They're everything you need to choose your ultimate treatments.
   Go bold, go confident.

   [v2.i1151918.w688.h458.x653B0025.jpeg]

Body

   From tanning to exfoliation treatments, mud wraps to massages, if
   you're looking to treat your body to some serious pampering, booking
   into a beauty salon is the first step in your journey to utter
   relaxation.
   [v2.i1151955.w688.h458.xD05D1AB3.jpeg]

Face

   If you're searching for the perfect facial, many beauty salons offer a
   range of treatments that cater to your complexion. Filled with expertly
   trained staff to get to the bottom of any skin issue, booking in for a
   facial is an important first step to getting your skin back on track.
   [v2.i1153272.w688.h458.x937D880C.jpeg]

Hair

   Hair salons come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Whether you prefer
   to splurge on regular hair appointments or like to chop and change to
   suit your location and your budget, one thing is for certain - we all
   need a good trim every so often and a hair salon is the place to do it.
   [v2.i1153275.w688.h458.xC300F055.jpeg]

Hair removal

   Do you know your Brazilian from your Hollywood wax? Or the best way to
   rid your body of unwanted hair for good? Whether you're looking for
   long-term results or are content with your monthly wax sessions, a hair
   removal salon will cater to all your body hair needs under one roof.
   [v2.i1153409.w688.h458.xE24872CD.jpeg]

Massage

   Massage is the answer to any pain, tighteness or muscle ache you may
   have. A good massage performed by a professional massage therapist
   helps alleviate the pain in a matter of minutes! If you can’t seem to
   kick sore shoulders and aching joints, you need to book yourself a nice
   massage at the salon asap.
   [v2.i1153406.w688.h458.xB6B904ED.jpeg]

Nails

   Nail bars are the best. Go in feeling drab and un-groomed and come out
   looking like a million dollars. Yes, whether it's a quick shape and
   tidy, a full on set of acrylics or a bold, neon pedi, nail salons have
   the power to transform your nails.

Where to go? What to choose?

   [v2.i759436.w688.h488.x89E6782E.jpeg]

Barbershop

   Are you a dapper gent who takes his personal grooming pretty seriously?
   Then the barbershop is the perfect pitstop for you. From wet shaves to
   a good old fashioned haircut, barbershops offer a wide selection of
   treatments for the man who takes pride in his appearance.
   [v2.i759437.w688.h533.xC3C4551D.jpeg]

Beauty Salon

   A beauty salon is your one stop shop for all things pampering,
   beautifying and grooming. You'll find everything from facials to spray
   tans to lash extensions and even a spot of nail art. And it's not just
   for the girls. Most beauty salons welcome men with open arms.

About Gift Cards

What is a Treatwell Gift Card?

   Each Treatwell Gift Card carries a monetary balance that can be used to
   purchase salon and spa treatments exclusively on treatwell.ie or the
   Treatwell App. Gift cards delivered via email include a unique 14-digit
   code that when entered prior to purchase, apply a reduction to the
   order total.

Where can I spend my Gift Card?

   Gift Cards are valid for online bookings and eVoucher purchases made
   via treatwell.ie or the Treatwell App. Simply browse and book in at one
   of over thousands of venues nationwide.

   Gift Cards can be used as full or part payment for all purchasable
   treatments and stays, but cannot be used to purchase more gift cards.

   If your treatment costs more than the value of the Gift Card, you can
   pay the additional amount at checkout. Similarly, if you don’t want to
   spend the whole gift at once, the remaining balance will stay in your
   Treatwell Wallet.

How do I spend my Gift Card?

   Recipients can enter the code in the special field at the checkout when
   making a purchase. They will then be asked to create a Treatwell
   account so they do not lose any remaining credit.

How long will my Gift Card be valid for?

   Your Gift Card balance will remain valid for twelve months after the
   date of purchase. The exact expiry date will be included in the Gift
   Card email itself. If you have added the card to an account, you will
   also be able to see when your balance is due to expire when you log in
   and visit the My Wallet section of your profile.

When will my Gift Card arrive?

   Gift Cards will be sent via email and should arrive in your chosen
   inbox instantly.

   If your Gift Card does not arrive, please email
   customer.care@treatwell.ie

I need to cancel my Gift Card purchase - what should I do?

   We offer a 14 day return policy on all Gift Cards, during which you can
   cancel your purchase, provided it hasn’t yet been added to a Treatwell
   account. So if you have accidentally purchased too many Gift Cards or
   no longer wish to proceed with your order, please get in touch with our
   Customer Experience team on customer.care@treatwell.ie.
   Booking is easier on our app.
