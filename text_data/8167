       Section 2 (All Media License):

            the Content as part of a Production or packaging of or printed

       Production that incorporates the Content.
    6. Merchandise:
         1. If we have granted you an Individual License or Team License
            for the Content or a Digital License, the License does not
            include a right to use the Content in Merchandise.
              1. What is included in "Merchandise": Items of physical
                 products sold or distributed by or for you, including
                 toys, games, physical electronic products, and paper
                 goods, such as greeting or post cards, business cards,

                 stationary, novelty goods, trading cards, tickets,
                 payment cards, bank checks, or apparel. For the avoidance
                 of doubt, using Content in Merchandise includes the right
                 to install the Content on a computer, cell phone or other
                 electronic device located in a retail establishment where
                 the Content is included for the purpose of demonstrating
                 the capabilities of the device if the device does not
                 permit transmission or storage of the Content or
                 Productions containing the Content outside the device.
              2. What is not included in "Merchandise": (i) books or
                 periodicals, or (ii) music, video or audiovisual
                 Productions that are in physical media (e.g., in a CD,
                 DVD), or (iii) packaging or informational or promotional
                 collateral that accompanies such a Production containing
                 the Content where the Content is not sold separately from
                 the Production – all of which are deemed to be included
                 in the term "Production" described in and covered by the
                 license in Section 2 (All Media License), rather than
                 "Merchandise".
         2. if we have granted you our Business License or Premium License
            for the Content under Section 2 (All Media License), the
            License includes the right to use the Content in an unlimited
            number of items of Merchandise.

5. License Terms and Restrictions.

    1. Item Page: In addition to the terms and conditions of this
       Agreement, the License to the Content is subject to any special
       terms that are contained or linked to in the Item Page for that
       particular Content, if any, including restrictions on the number or
       type of Productions or Merchandise in which the Content may be
       used.
    2. Previews: Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, this
       Agreement does not apply to, and Content under this Agreement does
       not include, any preview of any item displayed in or downloaded
       from the Website or otherwise provided to you (a "Preview");
       Previews are in all respects displayed, downloaded and provided
       under the Website Terms of Use.
    3. You must Limit Access to and Distribution of Raw Content: You may
       not allow access to raw Content, except for the purpose of
       creation, reproduction or distribution of Productions or
       Merchandise made by or for the Licensee as permitted by this
       Agreement. If you become aware of any unauthorized access to or
       duplication of any Content, you should promptly notify us via the
       Website. Except as expressly permitted by Section 2, you may not
       (i) distribute, transmit or publicly display Content as a template,
       a standalone file or to others for consumption, reproduction or
       re-sale, or (ii) superficially modify any raw Content and sell or
       license it to others.
    4. No reverse Engineering: For 3D models or After Effects or Photoshop
       PSD templates, you may not reverse engineer, decompile, or
       disassemble any part of any source code contained within the
       Content or avoid, bypass, remove or impair any technological
       measure that limits access to the Content.
    5. No Use in Trademarks or Logos: You may not incorporate any Content
       into a logo, trademark or service mark.
    6. Sensitive Use: Unless we have granted you a Premium License for the

       unflattering or unduly controversial to a reasonable person,
       including use related to the promotion, advertisement or
       endorsement of any political party, candidate, or elected official,
       or in connection with any political policy or viewpoint, or as
       suffering from, or medicating for, a physical or mental ailment
       (each of the foregoing, "Sensitive Use"). For avoidance of doubt,
       use of Content that is not Editorial Content in an obviously
       satirical Production or use of Editorial Content in accordance with
       Section 8 would not be prohibited by this section.
    7. No Unlawful Use: You may not use any Content in, a pornographic,
       unlawful or defamatory context or manner, including use (i) in
       connection with pornography, adult videos, adult entertainment
       venues, escort services, dating services, or the like; (ii) in
       connection with the advertisement or promotion of tobacco products;
       or (iii) depicting a person in the Content as engaging in acts of
       moral turpitude or criminal activity.
    8. Retention of Rights to the Content: You will not acquire, and we
       and/or the Content contributor will retain, all right, title, and
       interest in and to all of the copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets
       and other proprietary rights in the Content or Content Information
       that are not expressly granted to you by the terms of this
       Agreement. The License does not include the right to record a new
       performance of the composition reflected by the Content.

       material compliance by you and your personnel and contractors (each
       a "Representative") with this Agreement and our receipt of full
       payment of the applicable price for the License and Content.
   10. Contact Us If You Need Rights for Use Not Permitted By this
       Agreement: If you need to use any Content in a manner that is not
       permitted by this Agreement, contact Pond5 at sales@pond5.com.

6. Content Showing Depicted IP and Placeholders.

    1. Depicted IP: Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the
       License does not include, and except for locations for which the
       Item Page states that we have a property release, we make no
       warranties with regard to, any building, house, trademark, trade
       dress, logo, copyrighted design, art, architecture or other works
       that may be depicted in the Content (collectively, "Depicted IP").
    2. Audio in Video Clips: For Content that is film, video footage or
       any other audiovisual work, any music, dialogue or other ambient
       audio contained therein is incidental only; accordingly, our
       warranties do not apply to, and you are solely responsible for
       obtaining any additional clearances relating to, any of the audio
       that may be required.
    3. Placeholders in After Effects and PSD Templates: After Effects and
       Photoshop PSD templates may contain placeholder music, dialogue,
       other audio, text, video and/or images. Such placeholders are
       intended only for demonstration purposes, so our warranties do not
       apply to such placeholders and you are solely responsible for
       obtaining your own cleared versions of the same.

7. Editorial Content.

   For Content which the Item Page states is editorial or for editorial
   use only (collectively, "Editorial Content"), in addition to the other
   limitations and restrictions in this Agreement, the following terms
   apply:
    1. Intended for Editorial Use: This type of Content is intended to be
       used only in connection with events or topics that are newsworthy
       or of general public interest.
    2. No Commercial or Merchandizing Use: Absent Pond5’s express and
       specific written (could be by email) consent, Editorial Content may
       not be used in any Merchandise, advertisement, endorsement,
       promotion, advertorial, or any other commercial Production.
    3. Need for Clearances: The License does not include any clearances
       that may be necessary for any personally identifiable information
       of any person, nor any privacy or publicity rights from any person
       whose name, portrait, image or performance appears in the Content.
       Accordingly, neither we nor our Editorial Content contributor make
       any warranties with regard to such Editorial Content.
    4. No Compromise of Editorial Integrity: Modification of this Content
       shall be limited to cropping or resizing still photographs and
       editing video footage for length or combining it with other
       content, provided that the editorial meaning of the Editorial
       Content is not altered or distorted.

8. Music and other Audio Content.

    1. Types of Audio Content: We offer various kinds of music and other
       audio recording Content without video, pictures or other visual
       works ("Audio Content"), which may be designated on the applicable
       Item Page, among other things, as "Music" or "Music Tracks" (music,
       with or without lyrics) or "Sound FX" or "SFX" (sound effects).
    2. PRO Content: If the PRO box adjacent to a Music Track on the Item
       Page is checked or the Music Track is otherwise designated as a PRO
       Track, then it is considered to be "PRO Track". "PRO" means a
       performing rights organization or other similar organization
       (including ASCAP, BMI, SOCAN, SESAC, PRS, MCPS, SACEM, SDRM or
       JASRAC, GEMA). For PRO Tracks, notwithstanding anything else in
       this Agreement, the License does not include the right to public
       performance of the composition, there is no waiver of any PRO
       royalties or cue sheet obligations, and our warranties do not cover
       such performance rights. The foregoing may also apply to other
       Music Tracks created in a country (e.g., certain EU countries)
       where, notwithstanding the Content contributor’s grant of
       sub-licensable performance rights to us, under applicable law, PRO
       membership and/or application of PRO rights may be considered to be
       mandatory.
    3. Restrictions on All Audio Content: In addition to the other
       restrictions in this Agreement, you may not do any of the following
       regarding any Audio Content:
         1. use it in whole or part to manufacture, distribute or sell
            records, CDs, jukeboxes, mp3s or any other predominantly audio
            product embodying it, in whole or in part, that is not
            synchronized or combined with other audio or musical content
            to create a derivative work as permitted in this Agreement
            (for example, you cannot use it to create a CD or other music
            compilation to give away or sell);
         2. place it on or in any product or platform that makes it
            available in a manner such that a person can without
            extraordinary effort extract or access or reproduce it as an
            electronic file;
         3. use or display it in whole or part in an electronic format
            that enables it to be accessed or distributed or shared in any
            peer-to-peer or similar file sharing arrangement;
         4. resell it in whole or part as backgrounds, "hold" music or
            ringtones; or
         5. incorporate it in whole or part in any product or platform
            that results in its re-distribution or re-sale (such as music
            download sites, stock music CDs, electronic greeting card web
            sites, web templates and the like).
    4. Audio Content Cleared for Sampling: For Audio Content designated on
       the Website as being "Cleared for Sampling", you may do any of the
       following:
         1. edit, modify, or alter it;
         2. use it in whole or part without synchronization or other
            combination with other original work(s) of authorship so that
            the combination constitutes a Production;
         3. use it, in whole or in part, as an element of a new musical
            work (e.g., by combining the Audio Content with other work so
            that a copyright can be claimed in the resulting song); or
         4. modify it, in whole or in part, so that a copyright can be
            claimed in the resulting song other than as part of a
            Production that consists of an audio visual work, computer or
            mobile device application or an internet page.
    5. Restrictions on Audio Content Not Cleared for Sampling: Unless the
       Audio Content is designated on the Website as being "Cleared for
       Sampling", you may not do any of the things mentioned in paragraph
       (d) above; provided that you may do basic editing (e.g., setting
       fade-in/fade-out points, determining start and end points, or using
       only a portion of it), in a way that does not alter its fundamental
       character, harmonic structure, lyrics and/or melody or prejudice of
       the un-waivable moral rights of the artist(s).

9. Credit Attribution.

    1. For Editorial Content, you will accompany the Production with a
       credit line that attributes the Content to the Content contributor
       and Pond5, and if the Production is posted online, you will use
       your commercially reasonable efforts to make the credit line
       include a hyperlink to www.pond5.com.
    2. For all other Content, where crediting is customary or where other
       such credits are provided, you will use your reasonable commercial
       efforts to accompany the Production with a credit line that reads
       "Stock media provided by [Content contributor Name]/ Pond5" or
       substantively similar language.
    3. The unintentional omission of credit attribution provided for above
       will not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement, and the
       omission of credit attribution will not be considered to be a
       material breach of this Agreement.

    1. Our Indemnity: Subject to the limitations in Section 12(b), we will
       defend, indemnify and hold you harmless from any actual or
       threatened third party lawsuit, claim, or legal proceeding (each, a
       "Claim") alleging a breach or facts that if true would constitute a
       breach of any of our express representations and warranties in this
       Agreement or that the distribution or use of Content downloaded and
       used by you pursuant to this Agreement violates any of such
       representations and warranties (each, a "Pond5 Indemnified Claim"),
       together with any liability for direct damages arising therefrom
       and reasonable attorneys' fees connected therewith, provided in
       each case that you have paid all amounts due to us and have not
       otherwise materially breached the terms of the Agreement.
    2. Indemnity Conditions: Our obligations under paragraph (a) above
       (the "Pond5 Indemnification") are conditioned upon you complying
       with the requirements of this paragraph: (i) You must notify us in
       writing of the Pond5 Indemnified Claim as soon as is practical, but
       in any case no later than ten (10) business days from the date you
       know or reasonably should have known of the same. Such notification
       must include all details of the claim then known to you (e.g.,
       Pond5 Content Number, a copy of the Content and your Production,
       name and contact information of person and/or entity making the
       claim, nature and date of alleged claim, copies of any
       correspondence received and/or sent in connection with the Pond5
       Indemnified Claim). The notification must be sent to us at our
       address on our Website via Certified Mail, Return Receipt
       Requested, or reputable express delivery service, in each case,
       recipient's signature required, with a contemporaneous email copy
       to legal@pond5.com. (ii) You must allow us to assume and control
       the investigation, handling, settlement and defense of the Pond5
       Indemnified Claim, and you must cooperate reasonably therewith. You
       shall have the right to participate in the investigation of the
       Claim or any litigation at your own expense. The Pond5
       Indemnification will be your sole remedy for a breach of any of our
       representations, warranties and/or obligations. Notwithstanding
       anything to the contrary contained herein, we shall not be liable
       for, and Pond5 Indemnified Claims shall not include, any Claim
       related to or arising out of: (A) the particular modifications made
       to Content after Download; (B) the particular context in which the
       Content is used; (C) use of Content not authorized by the License
       or breach of or failure to carry out an obligation or
       responsibility assumed by you in this Agreement, or (D) any
       Excluded Content (each such Claim referred to in (A) through (D), a
       "Use Related Claim"). In addition, our obligations under the Pond5
       Indemnification are conditioned upon payment in full of all amounts
       due to us and your full material compliance with this Agreement.
    3. Your Indemnity: You agree to indemnify and hold Pond5, our
       Affiliates, the applicable Content contributor, our resellers and
       our and their respective Representatives, shareholders and partners
       (collectively, "Pond5 Parties") and the Content contributors
       harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs
       and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs)
       arising out of or relating to any Use Related Claim; provided that
       this indemnity shall not apply to the Pond5 Parties to the extent
       that the claim arises from a breach by us of a warranty set forth
       in Section 10(a) above or to a Content contributor to the extent
       that the claim arises from a breach by the contributor of a
       certification, representation or warranty.

12. Limitations of Liability.

    1. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 11(a), The POND5 PARTIES
       AND THE CONTENT CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY
       OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
       EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR, IN
       THE CASE OF US OR THE OTHER POND5 PARTIES, ANY OTHER DAMAGES, COSTS
       OR LOSSES, INCLUDING THE COST OF COVER, ARISING UNDER THIS
       AGREEMENT OR OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE LICENSE, YOUR OR ANY OF YOUR
       REPRESENTATIVES’ USE OR EXPLOITATION OF CONTENT, THE WEBSITE OR THE
       CONTENT INFORMATION, ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY US OR THE RESULTS
       FROM THE USE THEREOF OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF
       THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, COSTS OR LOSSES, WHETHER THE
       ACTION IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
       INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHERWISE.
    2. THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO EACH ITEM
       OF CONTENT (meaning the total amount we may be responsible for,
       whether under this agreement or any other agreement for the same
       Content, regardless of the number of times you license the same
       Content) SHALL BE LIMITED AS FOLLOWS:
         1. IF WE HAVE GRANTED YOU AN INDIVIDUAL LICENSE OR TEAM LICENSE
            FOR THE CONTENT, LIMITED TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS
            ($15,000),
         2. IF WE HAVE GRANTED YOU A BUSINESS LICENSE FOR THE CONTENT,
            LIMITED TO TWO HUNDRED-FIFTY THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ($250,000),
            and
         3. IF WE HAVE GRANTED YOU A PREMIUM LICENSE FOR THE CONTENT,
            LIMITED TO ONE MILLION U.S. DOLLARS ($1,000,000).
    3. THESE LIMITS APPLY EVEN IF WE OR ANOTHER POND5 PARTY HAS BEEN
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
       AGREE THAT (i) THE FEES FOR THE USE OF THE CONTENT REFLECT AND ARE
       SET IN RELIANCE UPON THE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THE LIMITATIONS OF
       LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND (ii) THE LIMITATIONS OF
       LIABILITY HEREIN ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE
       BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS
       OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE POND5 PARTIES OR THE CONTENT
       CONTRIBUTOR SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, COSTS OR LOSSES
       ARISING AS A RESULT OF PARTICULAR MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THE CONTENT
       BY YOU, ANY OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY THIRD PARTY AFTER THE
       CONTENT IS DOWNLOADED OR THE PARTICULAR CONTEXT IN WHICH THE
       CONTENT IS USED.
    4. No action, regardless of form, arising out of the License, or under
       this Agreement may be brought by you more than one year after the
       cause of action has accrued, in addition to the notice requirements
       in Section 11(b) above regarding Pond5 Indemnified Claims.

13. Term and Termination.

    1. Material Breach by You: The License will terminate automatically
       without notice from us if you fail to cure a material breach or
       other material failure to comply with any provision of this
       Agreement within 14 days of written notice from us of the same.
       Upon termination, to the extent reasonably practical, you must
       yourself and must cause your Representatives to immediately: (i)
       stop using the Content; (ii) delete or remove the Content from your
       premises, computer systems and storage (electronic or physical);
       and (iii) where applicable, ensure your Representatives and
       licensees do the same.
    2. Survival: The terms and provisions of Sections 1, 4 through 16
       shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.

14. Payments & Taxes.

    1. Sale of License Final: All sales of Licenses are final, and we are
       under no obligation to refund any fees paid by you for Content
       under any circumstances, except upon a material breach of one of
       our express representations and warranties set forth herein.
       However, if you request a refund, and we, in our sole discretion,
       determine to provide you with a refund, the license granted in this
       Agreement for the Content will be rescinded as if never granted.
       Any refund will be made by such means as we determine is
       appropriate.
    2. Taxes: You are responsible for promptly paying any and all
       applicable sales taxes, use taxes, value added taxes, property tax,
       customs, duties and any related interest or penalties imposed by
       any jurisdiction as a result of the License or any use of the
       Content.
    3. No Set-Off, Withholdings or Deductions: You must pay all amounts
       due to us in a payment currency approved on the Website without any
       set off, deduction or withholding of any kind, including tax
       withholdings or amounts charged for currency conversion. To the
       extent that you determine that you are required under law (e.g.,
       under a tax law) to withhold any amount from payments due to us or
       a financial institution or other intermediary deducts any amount
       for currency conversion or other services from your payment to us,
       the price for the applicable License is hereby increased by the
       amount that would cause the net amount actually received by us to
       equal the price that would otherwise apply for the sale of the
       License.

15. Parties.

    1. You: As used in this Agreement, the term, the "Licensee", "you" and
       "your" refer to the person designated as "Licensee" when the
       Content is downloaded from the Website or otherwise first

       the Licensee or has authority to and does in fact bind the
       designated Licensee to this Agreement.
    2. Us: If Licensee is located in the United States, then the party
       with which you are contracting is, and as used herein the terms
       "Pond5", "we", "us" and "our" refer to Pond5, Inc., a Delaware
       corporation. If Licensee is located outside the United States, then
       the party with which you are contracting and which is granting you
       the License is, and as used herein the terms "Pond5", "we", "us"

       communications from us electronically and you agree that all
       agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we
       provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that

    2. You Consent to Us Processing Your Data in Different Countries: You
       consent to your personal information being shared with and
       processed in the course of our business by us and our Affiliates,
       which are located in Ireland, various other different countries in
       the EU or in the U.S., which provide varying and in some cases less
       privacy protection than your country.
    3. Unless the context requires otherwise, in any part of this
       Agreement: (i) "including" (and any of its derivative forms, e.g.
       "includes"), "e.g." and "for example" means "including but not
       limited to"; (ii) "must not", "should not", "shall not" and "may
       not" are expressions of prohibition, and "will", "must", "should"
       and "shall" are expressions of command, and not merely expressions
       of future intent or expectation; (iii) use of the singular imports
       the plural and vice versa; (iv) references to one or no gender
       include the other or no gender; "(v) when applied to a company,
       "Affiliate(s)" means any/all companies that from time to time
       directly or indirectly are owned or controlled by such company,
       under common ownership or control with such company or own or
       control such company; (vi) "Person" means an individual or legal
       entity, including a company or a governmental agency or
       instrumentality; and (vi) the headings in this Agreement are for
       ease of reference only and shall not affect its interpretation.
    4. This Agreement is in addition to the Website Terms of Use, the
       Pond5 Privacy Policy, and the other terms, disclaimers,
       restrictions contained on the applicable Item Page at the time of
       Download of the Content item (collectively, the "Website Terms"),
       (which are all incorporated by reference into this Agreement), all
       of which together with this Agreement embody the parties' entire
       agreement and supersedes and cancels any prior or implied agreement
       with respect to its subject matter; provided that in the event of
       any inconsistency between this Agreement and such Website Terms,
       the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
    5. Notwithstanding anything else in this or any other agreement, (i)
       we reserve the right to make changes to this Agreement at any time
       and without notice to you, and (ii) you will be subject to the
       terms of the same in force at the time that the Content was first
       Downloaded for or by you. For avoidance of doubt, a change to any
       of the same will not apply to Content that was first Downloaded for
       or by you prior to the change. No modification, deletion, amendment
       of any provision is binding on us unless in writing signed by our
       authorized representative or posted by us on the Website.
    6. If you learn that any Content is subject to a threatened or actual
       third party claim of infringement, violation of another right, or
       any other claim for which we may be liable, you will promptly
       notify us of any such claim. If we learn of such a claim from you,
       the third party or otherwise and we, in our sole good faith
       discretion, determine that the claim raises an inappropriate legal
       risk, upon notice from us, you will (i) remove the Content from
       your computer systems and storage devices (electronic or physical),
       and (ii) cease any future use of the Content at your own expense if
       possible. If you do remove and cease use of the Content, we will
       either refund your license fees for the applicable Content or
       without charge provide you with other content that we determine
       with your consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, is
       comparable, subject to the other terms and conditions of this
       Agreement.
    7. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and
       nothing in this Agreement or the License shall create a joint
       venture, partnership or franchise or fiduciary relationship between
       the parties.
    8. If any provision, or portion thereof, of this Agreement, or its
       application to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid,
       illegal or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this
       Agreement, or such provision and their application shall not be
       affected thereby, but shall be interpreted without such
       unenforceable provision or portion thereof so as to give effect,
       insofar as is possible, to the original intent of the parties, and
       shall otherwise be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
       law.
    9. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of
       the United States and the State of New York without regard to its
       choice of law provisions. The United Nations Convention on
       Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not govern this
       Agreement. The License, any Download of Content and access to and
       use of the Website and the entering into this Agreement will be
       deemed to take place in the United States.
   10. Any dispute relating to or arising from this Agreement, the
       License, the Content or the use thereof will be resolved
       exclusively by a State or Federal court in New York City in the
       United States. We and you hereby waive any objection to venue, or
       to the inconvenience of the forum, of any such court or right to
       trial by jury to resolve any such dispute. The parties hereby
       consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
   11. You will promptly reimburse us for any costs (including reasonable
       attorneys' fees and court costs) that are incurred by us in
       collecting any License fees due to us.
   12. All of the covenants, terms, provisions and agreements contained in
       this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of,
       the parties hereto and, to the extent permitted by this Agreement,
       their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and
       permitted assigns.
   13. The Pond5 Parties, the applicable Content contributor and the
       Persons indemnified under Section 11 are intended third Person
       beneficiaries of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express
       or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other third
       Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever.
   14. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any notice required or
       permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing,
       delivered by hand, nationally recognized overnight courier service,
       email or registered or certified mail, addressed (i) to Pond5 at:
       our address set forth at www.pond5.com/legal, with a copy by email
       to legal@pond5.com; or (ii) to you at the email address or mailing
       address provided for the Pond5 User account or registration under
       which the relevant Content was downloaded.
   15. If you breach any provision of this Agreement and we take no
       action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in
       any other situation where you breach this Agreement. Your
       obligations, the limitations and our rights and remedies set out in
       this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to your
       obligations and the copyright owner’s rights and remedies at law or
       in equity.
   16. This Agreement and the License are non-transferable without Pond5’s
       prior written consent. However, if we have granted you a Premium
       License for the Content, you may one-time assign the License on the
       condition that the assignee agrees to the terms of this Agreement
       and you provide us with prompt written notice of the assignment.
       This means that except as permitted herein, you may not resell,
       sublicense, rent, loan, assign or transfer the Content to any third
       Person, provided that no restriction on transferability in this
       Agreement applies to your Productions or Merchandise that
       incorporate Content pursuant to the License. Pond5 may assign this
       Agreement without your consent to an Affiliate as part of a
       corporate reorganization or any other Person as part of a merger or
       asset or business sale so long as such Person agrees to be bound by
       its terms.

   Policy to describe our privacy policies and practices and how we
   collect, use and disclose the personal information of those individuals
   who visit the Website and use Cookies. By accessing or using the
   Website or providing any personal information on the Website or

       minor, the minor's) privacy or publicity rights;

   the information regarding Previews or Content that is displayed on the
   Website (“Content Information”), and (ii) use the Previews and Content
   Information solely for the purpose of evaluating whether you or your

   as may be otherwise agreed by Pond5, you shall have no right to make
   any further use of such Preview. You are responsible for ensuring that
   your employer complies with the terms of this paragraph and you and
   your employer are responsible for ensuring that any client that is
   provided a Preview complies with the terms of this paragraph. If you
   and your employer or client purchase a license to the Content under the
   License Agreement, the above limitations will not apply to you and your
   employer or client, as the case may be, to the extent expressly
   provided in the License Agreement.

       information in your notice is accurate and that you are the
       copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on

   Counter-Notice: If you believe that your Content that was removed is
   not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright
   owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload

   counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright

   that person that we may re-post the removed content in 10 business
   days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order
   against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may
   be re-posted on the Website, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14
   business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole

Interpretation.

   Unless the context requires otherwise, in any part of these Terms of
   Use (a) “including” (and any of its derivative forms, e.g. “includes”),
   “e.g.” and “for example” means “including but not limited to”; (b)
   "must not", “should not”, “shall not” and “may not” are expressions of
   prohibition, and “will”, "must", “should” and “shall” are expressions
   of command, and not merely expressions of future intent or expectation;
   (c) use of the singular imports the plural and vice versa; (d)
   references to one or no gender include the other or no gender; (e)
   references to the terms “herein” or “hereto” refer to these Terms of
   Use (including any terms incorporated by reference herein); (f) the
   headings in these Terms of Use are for ease of reference only and shall
   not affect its interpretation; and (g) when calculating the time period
   before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or
   step taken pursuant to these Terms of Use, the date that is the
   reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded and the
   time period shall be deemed to end at 11:59 PM Greenwich Mean Time on
   the applicable date.

Miscellaneous Provisions.

    a. The parties to these Terms of Use are independent contractors, and
       nothing in these Terms of Use or the guidelines, policies,
       restrictions and agreements on the Website shall create a joint
       venture, partnership, employment relationship, or franchise or
       fiduciary relationship between the parties.
    b. No waiver of any default under these Terms of Use will apply to any
       subsequent default, whether of a similar nature or not, nor will
       any such waiver be construed as a waiver of any other provision of
       these Terms of Use.
    c. If any provision, or portion thereof, of these Terms of Use, or its
       application to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid,
       illegal or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of these
       Terms of Use, such provision and their application shall not be
       affected thereby, but shall be interpreted without such
       unenforceable provision or portion thereof so as to give effect,
       insofar as is possible, to the original intent of the parties, and
       shall otherwise be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
       law.
    d. These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws
       of the State of New York without regard to its choice of law
       provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
       International Sale of Goods does not govern these Terms of Use. Any
       access to and use of the Website and the entering into these Terms
       of Use will be deemed to take place in the United States.
    e. Any dispute regarding these Terms of Use will be resolved
       exclusively by a State or Federal court in New York City in the
       United States. We and you hereby waive any objection to venue, or
       to the inconvenience of the forum, of any such court or right to
       trial by jury to resolve any such dispute. The parties hereby
       consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
    f. You represent that, if you are an individual, you are at least 18
       years of age and have the full right and authority to enter into
       these Terms of Use and conduct all activity conducted or to be
       conducted by you in or through the Website.
    g. The Pond5 Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of these
       Terms of Use. Nothing in these Terms of Use or the guidelines,
       policies on the Website, express or implied, is intended to or
       shall confer upon any third person or entity other than the Pond5
       Parties any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever.
       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no provision
       herein shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by any creditor
       of any party hereto.
    h. If you breach any provision of these Terms of Use or any other
       agreements or policies referred to herein and we take no action, we
       will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other
       situation where you breach these Terms of Use or any other such
       agreement or policy.
    i. Your obligations and our rights and remedies set out in these Terms
       of Use are cumulative and are in addition to your obligations and
       our rights and remedies at law or in equity.
    j. Pond5 may assign these Terms of Use without your consent to any
       other party.
    k. These Terms of Use are in addition to the Pond5 Contributor

       Program Terms, the Pond5 Privacy Policy and the policies,
       guidelines and restrictions contained on the Website (which are all

Information Sharing

   We will share your personal information with third parties only in the
   ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your
   personal information to third parties.

   providers who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire
   other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data
   storage, processing or management, to host websites or computer
   servers, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in marketing, to
   conduct audits, etc. Those third-party service providers (i) are
   permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide
   the service, (ii) are required by Pond5 to protect personal information
   to the same extent as Pond5 and as required by applicable law,
   including, if they process personal information of persons residing in

   only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and (iv) are
   prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

       safety of us or others, investigate fraud, defend ourselves from
       legal claims, or respond to a government request;

       portion of its assets; (In such event, you will be notified via

       uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may
       have regarding your personal information.);

   We use third party website analytic services, including Google
   Analytics and New Relic, to gather information about how you and others
   use our Website, and to facilitate Website users use of the Website.
   For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and
   which links they clicked on. We may use this aggregated information to

   regarding your activity on the Website to assess your content and other
   needs so that we may offer content and/or services to meet such needs.

   Web beacons
   Certain of our emails may contain electronic images known as Web
   beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that are set by our third
   party service providers. Web beacons are used along with cookies
   enabling us to associate your responses to your Website account and/or
   compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our email campaigns are
   received by their recipients.

   Widgets
   Our Website may include Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs
   that run on our Website to provide specific services from another
   company (e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc). Personal
   information, such as your email address, may be collected through a
   Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function
   properly. Information collected by a Widget is governed by the privacy
   policy of the company that created it.

   Links to Other Internet Sites
   Our Website includes links to other Internet sites whose privacy
   practices may differ from those of Pond5. If you submit personal
   information to any of those sites, your information is governed by
   their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy
   policy of any Internet site you visit.

Security

   The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow
   generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal
   information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
   receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
   electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot
   guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about
   security on our Website, you can contact us at privacy@pond5.com. If
   you have any question about the security of a payment gateway or
   processor, you should contact the payment gateway or processor.

Additional Policy Information

   Website Blogs and Forums
   Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You
   should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be
   read, collected, and used by others who access them.

   Reviewing and Correcting and Updating your Personal Information
   Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, you have
   the right to receive a copy of, review and/or update your personal
   information and to correct any of your personal information in our
   records that is inaccurate. We extend this right to persons everywhere.
   If you would like to do so, contact us at privacy@pond5.com.

   Deletion or Restriction of Our right to Store or Process your Personal
   Information
   Under the GDPR, you have the right to restrict processing of or request
   erasure of your personal information. However this right is not
   absolute, and we will continue to retain and use your personal
   information as we determine is necessary for management of continuing
   contractual rights and obligations, the establishment, exercise or
   defense of legal rights or claims or protect our or other Pond5
   contributors or licensee rights, which would include our need to comply
   with our contractual and other legal obligations, resolve disputes or
   claims, and enforce our agreements. If you have contributed any content
   to the Website or downloaded or licensed any content from the Website,
   because your and our contractual obligations and the rights grant by us
   to our licensees are perpetual and we could be subject to legal claims
   for many years, in most cases, we would not erase or stop use of your
   information.

   Notification of Privacy Policy Changes
   We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information
   practices or law or new information at any time and from time to time
   without notice. We encourage you to periodically review this page
   periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your
   continued access to or use of the Website after any such changes are
   posted will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to the changes.
   Again, the privacy policy and security practices of payment gateways
   and processors used to process payments to or from Pond5 will apply to
   information you provide to them. We encourage you to read those privacy
   policy before providing your information.

   This Contributor Agreement ("Agreement") governs the terms by which you
   make your media works available to Pond5 Media Ireland Limited, a
   limited liability company organized under the laws of Ireland (together

         4. we may temporarily or in select markets charge higher or lower

            which the same (or substantially the same) Content item is
            offered by or on any other media marketplace, agency or other
            redistribution arrangement (each an "Other Marketplace"), and
            if we discover that the Content item is offered at a lower
            price by or on any Other Marketplace, we may lower the price
            in our marketplace to match or beat that price.
    2. Except as expressly provided below, we will pay you the following
       percentages of all Net License Revenue and we will deduct and

            customer or that we determine are required by applicable law;
            (B) refunds, chargebacks and uncollectible sums; and (C) fees,
            charges and/or costs payable to or deducted by financial

            will deduct from Net License Revenue and retain a portion of
            the additional fees charged for the Extended License as a
            "Legal Guarantee Fee" to cover our self-insurance costs as
            determined by us in our sole discretion for providing the
            customer with additional legal protection. For avoidance of

       with respect to their works.

7. Global Partner and Limited Use Licensing Programs

    1. Pond5 has created a Global Partner Program with the aim of
       promoting Content in geographies, markets and to customers and
       Distributors that our traditional marketplace may not reach as
       optimally, and a Limited Use Licensing Program targeted to customer
       segments with high volume, short duration, digital/social media
       formats, small audience size, ad-supported models and/or other
       needs not met by our individual license model to which we will
       offer more narrow license rights or collections of limited content
       (e.g. our Membership) for materially reduced pricing determined by
       us, in our sole discretion, to best optimize total revenue for our
       contributors. While we believe that participation in these programs
       will generate additional revenue opportunities for Content, your
       participation is optional and you may opt out of either or both of
       these programs for all of the Content at any time on our Website
       Opt Out page.
    2. If you participate in our Global Partner Program, your license to
       us includes the right and license throughout the world to market,
       promote and distribute the Content through Distributors and
       authorize such Distributors to grant perpetual and term
       non-exclusive licenses to the Content to their customers under the
       Distributor’s own license agreements, which may include some or all
       of the rights that may be granted in the Website form of Pond5
       License Agreement.
    3. We will pay you your share of Net License Revenue for Content
       licensed under the Global Partner and Limited Use Licensing
       Programs as provided and subject to the provisions of Sections 3
       ("Pricing and Your Share of Net License Revenue") and 4 and the
       Website Payout Overview; provided that as part of our Global
       Partner or Limited Use Licensing Programs, we will have discretion
       to (i) set the price of Content and/or agree to compensation
       structures with the aim of maximizing overall sales of content and
       revenue to our contributors, and (ii) license Content to customers
       as part of a pool of works, in which case, we will have sole
       discretion to allocate the amounts paid by the customer among
       Content and the other works licensed to the customer on a basis
       that we in our sole good faith discretion determine is fair.

       "Losses") arising out of or relating to any claim, action or
       proceeding by a third Person (each, a "Claim") relating to or
       arising directly or indirectly out of (i) a claim that if proven
       would constitute a breach by us or any of our Representatives of
       this Agreement or any express representation, warranty, or
       obligation of us contained herein, or (ii) a claim that if proven
       would constitute a failure to fulfill any express responsibility or
       obligation assumed by us under this Agreement.
    2. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us, our Affiliates, and our
       and their respective Representatives and shareholders
       (collectively,"Pond5 Parties"), our Distributors and the Content
       Users harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of
       or relating to any Claim, relating to or arising directly or
       indirectly out of (i) a claim that if proven would constitute a
       breach by you or any of your Representatives of this Agreement or
       any express representation, warranty, or obligation contained
       herein, or (ii) a claim that if proven would constitute a failure
       to fulfill any express responsibility or obligation assumed by you
       under this Agreement. We may withhold amounts as security for any
       pending or threatened claim relating to any matter which is the
       subject of a representation, warranty or indemnity under this

       by law.
    3. The indemnified party shall (i) promptly notify the indemnifying

       excuse the indemnity obligation unless the failure to notify causes
       material prejudice to the indemnifying party); and (ii) cooperate
       with the indemnifying party in the defense of any Claim, at the
       indemnified party's expense. The indemnifying party will have the
       opportunity to defend the Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable
       to the indemnified party. Counsel that is acceptable to
       indemnifying party's errors and omissions insurance carrier shall
       be deemed to be acceptable to indemnified party. If for any reason
       the indemnifying party does not timely elect to or fails to timely
       defend a Claim as provided herein, the indemnified party may do so
       at the indemnifying party's sole expense. Notwithstanding the
       foregoing, (A) unless your insurance carrier agrees to indemnify
       Pond5 and assumes the defense of a Claim, Pond5 shall have the
       right to defend and control the defense or settlement of the Claim,
       and (B) the party controlling the defense of the Claim will not
       enter into any settlement agreement that creates a financial
       obligation on the other party to the Person making the Claim that
       is not reimbursed or assumed by controlling party without the other
       party’s written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
       delayed.

       agreement and supersedes and cancels any prior agreement, express
       or implied, written or oral, with respect to its subject matter;
       provided that in the event of any inconsistency between this
