International Tiger Day: Celebrating an integrated approach for tiger
conservation

   Between 1910 and 2010, tiger populations plummeted dramatically. On
   International Tiger Day, we celebrate just some of the successes that
   an integrated, global approach for tiger conservation has facilitated
   to save this charismatic species from extinction.

Unsustainable fishing and hunting for bushmeat driving iconic species to
extinction – IUCN Red List

   Overfishing has pushed two families of rays to the brink of extinction,
   while hunting for bushmeat and habitat loss have led to the decline of
   seven primate species, according to the latest update of The IUCN Red
   List of Threatened Species.

What is The IUCN Red List?

   Established in 1964, The International Union for Conservation of
   Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species has evolved to become the
   world’s most comprehensive information source on the global
   conservation status of animal, fungi and plant species.

   The IUCN Red List is a critical indicator of the health of the world’s
   biodiversity. Far more than a list of species and their status, it is a
   powerful tool to inform and catalyze action for biodiversity
   conservation and policy change, critical to protecting the natural
   resources we need to survive. It provides information about range,
   population size, habitat and ecology, use and/or trade, threats, and
   conservation actions that will help inform necessary conservation
   decisions.
   Learn more about The IUCN Red List

The IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria

   The IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria are intended to be an easily
   and widely understood system for classifying species at high risk of
   global extinction. It divides species into nine categories: Not
   Evaluated, Data Deficient, Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable,
   Endangered, Critically Endangered, Extinct in the Wild and Extinct.
     *

Data Deficient (DD)
       A taxon is Data Deficient (DD) when there is inadequate information
       to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction
       based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this
       category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but
       appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking.
       Species categorized as Data Deficient (DD)
     *
     *

Least Concern (LC)
       A taxon is Least Concern (LC) when it has been evaluated against
       the Red List criteria and does not qualify for Critically
       Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened.
       Species categorized as Least Concern (LC)
     *
     *

Near Threatened (NT)
       A taxon is Near Threatened (NT) when it has been evaluated against
       the criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered,
       Endangered or Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or is
       likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future.
       Species categorized as Near Threatened (NT)
     *
     *

Vulnerable (VU)
       A taxon is Vulnerable (VU) when the best available evidence
       indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable,
       and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of
       extinction in the wild.
       Species categorized as Vulnerable (VU)
     *
     *

Endangered (EN)
       A taxon is Endangered (EN) when the best available evidence
       indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered,
       and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of
       extinction in the wild.
       Species categorized as Endangered (EN)
     *
     *

Critically Endangered (CR)
       A taxon is Critically Endangered (CR) when the best available
       evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for
       Critically Endangered, and it is therefore considered to be facing
       an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
       Species categorized as Critically Endangered (CR)
     *
     *

Extinct In The Wild (EW)
       A taxon is Extinct In The Wild (EW) when it is known only to
       survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population
       (or populations) well outside the past range. A taxon is presumed
       Extinct in the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or
       expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual),
       throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual.
       Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life
       cycle and life form.
       Species categorized as Extinct In The Wild (EW)
     *
     *

Extinct (EX)
       A taxon is Extinct (EX) when there is no reasonable doubt that the
       last individual has died. A taxon is presumed Extinct when
       exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate
       times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range
       have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time
       frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.
       Species categorized as Extinct (EX)

Our goals

   To date, more than 105,700 species have been assessed for The IUCN Red
   List.

   This is an incredible achievement. However, our work is nowhere near
   complete. We need to more than double the number of wild species
   (plants, animals and fungi) assessed

   Our new goal is 160,000 species by 2020. Meeting this goal will provide
   the most up-to-date indication of the health of the world’s
   biodiversity to guide critical conservation action. This is only
   achievable with support from people like you.

International Tiger Day: Celebrating an integrated approach for tiger
conservation

   Between 1910 and 2010, tiger populations plummeted dramatically. On
   International Tiger Day, we celebrate just some of the successes that
   an integrated, global approach for tiger conservation has facilitated
   to save this charismatic species from extinction.

Unsustainable fishing and hunting for bushmeat driving iconic species to
extinction – IUCN Red List

   Overfishing has pushed two families of rays to the brink of extinction,
   while hunting for bushmeat and habitat loss have led to the decline of
   seven primate species, according to the latest update of The IUCN Red
   List of Threatened Species.

What is The IUCN Red List?

   Established in 1964, The International Union for Conservation of
   Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species has evolved to become the
   world’s most comprehensive information source on the global
   conservation status of animal, fungi and plant species.

   The IUCN Red List is a critical indicator of the health of the world’s
   biodiversity. Far more than a list of species and their status, it is a
   powerful tool to inform and catalyze action for biodiversity
   conservation and policy change, critical to protecting the natural
   resources we need to survive. It provides information about range,
   population size, habitat and ecology, use and/or trade, threats, and
   conservation actions that will help inform necessary conservation
   decisions.
   Learn more about The IUCN Red List

The IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria

   The IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria are intended to be an easily
   and widely understood system for classifying species at high risk of
   global extinction. It divides species into nine categories: Not
   Evaluated, Data Deficient, Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable,
   Endangered, Critically Endangered, Extinct in the Wild and Extinct.
     *

Data Deficient (DD)
       A taxon is Data Deficient (DD) when there is inadequate information
       to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction
       based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this
       category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but
       appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking.
       Species categorized as Data Deficient (DD)
     *
     *

Least Concern (LC)
       A taxon is Least Concern (LC) when it has been evaluated against
       the Red List criteria and does not qualify for Critically
       Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened.
       Species categorized as Least Concern (LC)
     *
     *

Near Threatened (NT)
       A taxon is Near Threatened (NT) when it has been evaluated against
       the criteria but does not qualify for Critically Endangered,
       Endangered or Vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or is
       likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future.
       Species categorized as Near Threatened (NT)
     *
     *

Vulnerable (VU)
       A taxon is Vulnerable (VU) when the best available evidence
       indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable,
       and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of
       extinction in the wild.
       Species categorized as Vulnerable (VU)
     *
     *

Endangered (EN)
       A taxon is Endangered (EN) when the best available evidence
       indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered,
       and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of
       extinction in the wild.
       Species categorized as Endangered (EN)
     *
     *

Critically Endangered (CR)
       A taxon is Critically Endangered (CR) when the best available
       evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for
       Critically Endangered, and it is therefore considered to be facing
       an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
       Species categorized as Critically Endangered (CR)
     *
     *

Extinct In The Wild (EW)
       A taxon is Extinct In The Wild (EW) when it is known only to
       survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population
       (or populations) well outside the past range. A taxon is presumed
       Extinct in the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or
       expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual),
       throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual.
       Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life
       cycle and life form.
       Species categorized as Extinct In The Wild (EW)
     *
     *

Extinct (EX)
       A taxon is Extinct (EX) when there is no reasonable doubt that the
       last individual has died. A taxon is presumed Extinct when
       exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate
       times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range
       have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time
       frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.
       Species categorized as Extinct (EX)

Our goals

   To date, more than 105,700 species have been assessed for The IUCN Red
   List.

   This is an incredible achievement. However, our work is nowhere near
   complete. We need to more than double the number of wild species
   (plants, animals and fungi) assessed

   Our new goal is 160,000 species by 2020. Meeting this goal will provide
   the most up-to-date indication of the health of the world’s
   biodiversity to guide critical conservation action. This is only
   achievable with support from people like you.
