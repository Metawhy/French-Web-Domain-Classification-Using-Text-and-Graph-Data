Nintendo cards catalogue from the mid 1930s

   Some time ago, I posted about a Nintendo company report from 1970,
   which provided an interesting view inside the company at a time when
   they were expanding into an allround toy company and just starting out
   in the field of electronics.
   Today we will travel even further back in time, to the mid 1930s, when
   Nintendo was still fully and solely focussed on their original product:
   playing cards. At the time Nintendo was the largest manufacturer of
   playing cards in Japan and under management of its second president
   Sekiryo Yamauchi, who in 1929 had succeeded his father in law, company
   founder Fusajiro Yamauchi.

                   [nintendo_catalogue_cards_30s_00.jpg]

   We take our trip through time using a recently surfaced
   Nintendo product catalogue that is more than eighty years old. The
   exact publishing date is not known, but based on the content, it is
   believed to be from between 1933 and 1937.
   The catalogue measures 19.2 by 8.6 centimeters when closed. It contains
   16 pages that fold out to double that width. It is printed double-sided
   in four colours: black, red, green and blue. Different to Western
   catalogues and modern day Japanese ones, the pages of the catalogue
   open on the left. The Japanese writing is top-to-bottom and
   right-to-left, as was also common at the time.
   [nintendo_catalogue_cards_30s_01.jpg]
   Although the catalogue contains some information in English, it is
   aimed at a Japanse speaking audience, with all sales information in
   Japanese only.
   [nintendo_catalogue_cards_30s_02.jpg]
   The catalogue contains four pages with information about the company,
   four pages with general marketing information about their playing
   cards, and eight pages with tables listing all products and their sales
   prices.

Nintendo Home Bowling (ホームボーリング, mid 1960s to early 1970s)

   In this post we will take a look at one of the largest games produced
   by Nintendo: Home Bowling (ホームボーリング). It comes in a box that is over
   one meter long, measuring 102 by 22 by 8 centimetres.
   [nintendo_home_bowling_00.jpg]
   As the name suggests, it's a bowling game for home use. Not a full size
   bowling alley, obviously, but a miniature version.
   [nintendo_home_bowling_01.JPG]
   The features listed in English on the side of the box promise a
   "life-like mechanical bowler", "ball return" and a "semi-automatic pin
   setter". In a minute we will see what that all means.
   So much English text on the box is quite uncommon for games for the
   Japanese market. Together with the Western looking figures on the front
   it provides an flavour suited very well for how Bowling was perceived
   in Japan at the time, as an American past-time.
   [nintendo_home_bowling_02.JPG]
   From the mid 1960s bowling became increasingly popular in Japan. It
   turned into a hype around 1970, when the number of bowling alleys in
   the country sky-rocketed to around 3,700 (in present days this has
   dwindled to around 800). The hardwood used for the construction of all
   these lanes reportedly caused a depletion of forests that would take
   half a century to restore, noted by US suppliers at the time.
   By the way, this bowling boom was followed quickly by a bowling bust.
   When interest in bowling wained in the early 1970s, Nintendo jumped
   into the market of under-occupied bowling alleys. In 1973 they produced
   the Laser Clay Shooting System, designed specifically for repurposing
   bowling lanes, giving them a new lease of life. But that's a story for
   a different time. Now back to Home Bowling.
   [nintendo_home_bowling_03.JPG]
   Home Bowling comes in a plain cardboard box with two colour printing on
   the sides and a full colour printed sheet glued on top. Other Nintendo
   games from this era (1965-1967) used simliar packaging, like My Car
   Race and the early versions of the Ultra Machine.

Nintendo leaflet from the 1970s

   It wasn't until the introduction of the Game & Watch series in 1980
   that Nintendo really started doing significant business outside of
   Japan. For the 90 years that it had existed previously, it was catering
   mostly exclusively to the Japanese market only.
   However, in the 1960s and 1970s many efforts where already made by
   Nintendo to expand its business abroad, be it with limited success.
   The leaflet shown here is an example of such efforts. It was most
   likely used to hand-out to foreign game and toy buyers, and other
   interested sales leads, maybe at an event like a trade show. It was
   recently found in the archives of the United States Patent and
   Trademark office.
   [nintendo_english_brochure_00.jpg]
   The leaflet is foldable affair, printed in color on two two-sides, with
   six sections on each side.
   [nintendo_english_brochure_01.jpg]
   The toys and games shown include light beam games introduced in 1976,
   but nothing newer, so it can be dated to the second half of the 1970s.
   [nintendo_english_brochure_02.jpg]
   The title on the front clearly states Nintendo's target market:
   "playing cards and games for adult". At this time, Nintendo also
   produced many games aimed at children in it's home market Japan. But
   for sales abroad it choose to focus on the adult market segment, with
   games mostly already known in the Western world, like cards, chess and
   roulette.
   Also keep in mind that many of the children's toy that Nintendo
   produced and sold in Japan where adaptations of licensed American and
   British games, and it did not make any sense to export these back to
   the West.

Chaotic Cube outer box from 1970

   Some time ago I came across an interesting box.
   [nintendo_chaotic_box_01.JPG]
   The box measures about 10 by 10 by 10 centimetres.
   [nintendo_chaotic_box_02.JPG]
   According to the sticker on the front it retailed for US$ 3.79 by
   Sears, Roebock and Co.
   The Sears company is an American institute (over the last decade fallen
   on hard times), with department shops across the country and a hugely
   popular mail order catalogue.
   [nintendo_chaotic_box_03.JPG]
   Inside is another box, with a Chaotic Cube.

Nintendo before Mario

   Before Nintendo became a global household name, it already had a rich
   history producing fun and, in some cases, downright wacky toys and
   games. You may have heard about the Love Tester or Ultra Hand, but few
   people are aware of just how broad Nintendo’s output was of in this
   period, and the extend to which this shaped the Nintendo of today.

                   [beforemario_dot_com_ultrahand_10.JPG]
                         Nintendo Ultra Hand (1966)

   Nintendo is one of the grand old ladies of the Japanese game industry.
   Established in 1889, it spent the majority of its first 75 years
   producing Japanese-style hanafuda cards and Western-style playing
   cards.
   [nintendo_playing_cards_01.JPG]
   The phenomenal ongoing global success Nintendo has had from the early
   1980s onwards - in handhelds (starting with the introduction of the
   Game & Watch game Ball in 1980), in arcades (Donkey Kong, 1981) and at
   home (Famicom in 1983 and NES in 1985) - often overshadows the period
   that preceded it. This “toy period”, which lasted roughly from 1965 to
   1983, is a pivotal period in Nintendo’s past. It is the missing link of
   corporate history that connects the hanafuda cards to the birth of the
   video game hardware and software that would follow.

                    [beforemario_dot_com_coasters_12.JPG]
                       Nintendo New Coaster Game (1965)

   The company culture established in the Sixties and Seventies provided
   the fertile ground from which their future growth bloomed. Important
   elements of the Nintendo philosophy of game development were nurtured
   in this period: fostering creativity and experimentation in design and
   a willingness to take this to the market, coupled with quality in
   execution and a focus on products that were really fun to play with.

              [beforemario_dot_com_lovetester_original_03.JPG]
                         Nintendo Love Tester (1969)

   Nintendo’s staff is known to stay at the company for decades, and a
   number of the key figureheads from its video game days, including
   Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, started out in the toy period,
   getting their first design experience developing these toys.

               [beforemario_dot_com_nintendo_tv_games_01.JPG]
                  Nintendo Color TV Game series (1977-1979)

   The majority of these toys and games did not make it beyond the borders
   of the Land of the Rising Sun, as Nintendo did not really start to
   market internationally until the Eighties. As a result, even though
   many did well at the time in their home market Japan, most of what is
   shown here is still quite obscure and unknown in Western territories.
   In this blog I will introduce you to these gems, taken from my personal
   collection.

My Collection

   Hi there! My name is Erik Voskuil and this here is my blog. I am an
   avid fan of video games and vintage toys and games from Nintendo's
   prehistory, before they made it big with the Famicom and NES. The items
   featured on this blog are taken from my personal collection, which has
   taken over 30 years to put together.
   [nintendo_shomen_dori_building_01.JPG]
   In 2014 I published a book called Before Mario, named after this blog.
   It covers the history of Nintendo in the period from 1965 to 1983,
   illustrated with many photos of rare vintage Nintendo items from my
   collection. You can order it at my publisher's site.
   [collection_01a.jpg]
   Some time ago (in 2006 actually - wow, how time flies), my collection
   was featured in the UK games magazine GamesTM, and the interview below
   is taken from their section "The Ultimate Collection".

                     [before_mario_mags_books_03.JPG]
                My "Ultimate collection" in GamesTM issue 42

   GamesTM: When did your Nintendo obsession start?
   Me: I prefer to call it 'an interest', although it may go a tad beyond
   that... Okay, I admit it, it's an obsession. It started gradually. I've
   always been into electro-mechanical and electronic entertainment
   devices. Pinball machines, jukeboxes and all sorts of arcade machines.
   When Donkey Kong appeared in 1981, it struck me as very original, and I
   switched to it from playing Pac-Man (which had been munching most of my
   change up to then). From that moment, 'How high can you get?' was on my
   mind for months.
   Around the same time, I also picked up playing LCD games. From the
   deluge of handheld titles in the early Eighties, the Nintendo games
   really stood out. They looked cool, and the gameplay was fantastic.
   Next came the NES (SMB3), the GameBoy (Tetris, Super Mario Land) and
   the SNES (Super Mario World), and I discovered a clear constant in my
   videogame preferences: Nintendo.
   I began importing games from Japan, and read about Nintendo's history.
   I learned that the company had existed for about a hundred years, and
   had been active in the toy business since the Sixties. A number of
   these toys that pre-date the 'videogame Nintendo' that we all know are
   designed by Gunpei Yokoi, who went on to create both the Game & Watch
   concept as well as the Game Boy (and the Virtual Boy). That further
   sparked my interest.
   Having acquired most Nintendo items of interest since the Eighties, I
   went further back in time to search for items from the company's
   prehistory. As a collector, you come up with new quests to keep
   yourself busy, but my main aim was to lay my hands on mystical things I
   had read about, like the Ultra Hand and the Ultra Machine.
   By this time, I'd started traveling to Japan regularly and learned a
   little Japanese. My general interest in the country went hand-in-hand
   with the specific Nintendo obsession.
   [collection_02a.jpg]
   GamesTM: What was the first item in your collection?
   Me: The first Nintendo item I bought was the double screen Game & Watch
   Mario Bros back in 1983, followed by Green House. That same year, I
   also got a Colecovision, primarily to play Donkey Kong at home, but I
   remember being disappointed when I discovered that one of the four
   levels had been chopped. No pie factory. The horror.
   [collection_03a.jpg]
   GamesTM: Where do you buy most of your stuff?
   Me: At first, I bought everything from local game stores, but as my
   interest went beyond what was for sale there, I started mail ordering
   things directly from the US, Hong Kong and Japan. These days, it's
   online stores, auction sites (eBay, Yahoo Japan), and shopping sprees
   in Japan. I'm also lucky to have met some great folks in Japan, who've
   helped find many of the rarer pieces.

                      [beforemario_dot_com_room_02.jpg]
                          My Game & Watch collection

   GamesTM: What's your most treasured item?
   Me: That's like asking a father of ten children to name his favorite.
   Still. if I must, then it's a toss up between two recently acquired
   items. First, there's the Famicom 20th Anniversary Game Boy Advance
   from 2003 which was a prize for members of Club Nintendo Japan. It
   combines the nostalgic feel of the Famicom with a Game Boy Advance SP.
   And second, I have a good-as-new Ultra Hand from 1966, which was
   actually the first Nintendo product designed by Gunpei Yokoi.
   [collection_04a.jpg]
   GamesTM: What's your favorite Mario game?
   Me: A tie between Super Mario World and Super Mario 64. With a gun
   against my head, I'd go for SMW because of the brilliant and fluent way
   you played both Mario and Yoshi. And did I mention Mario's cape? On the
   other hand, I recall the first few hours with the N64's controller and
   Super Mario 64 as pure gaming bliss.
   [collection_05a.jpg]
   GamesTM: Do you actually play all your consoles or are they just for
   display?
   Me: Stuff from the Seventies and early Eighties: not regularly. But
   anything from the NES onwards gets a regular spin. I play all the
   games' buy. I'm not a collector with stacks of unplayed and sealed
   games. I used to spend many hours playing games, and was a dedicated
   completist (96 levels, 120 stars, etc). But family life, other
   interests and the resulting lack of time mean I now only 'sample' most
   games. I have more fun keeping up with new releases, rather than
   finishing games but playing only a few. Games do still regularly come
   along that I just have to finish. These days. though, most of my game
   time is spent playing Mario Party with my daughters.

   In 2009, my game room was featured on Danny Choo's popular Culture
   Japan site. That post is still available.

   My collection has appeared in many video game magazines around the
   world.
   In September of 2010, I wrote a story for the retro section of GamesTM.
   The six-page article on the toys and games of Nintendo was included in
   issue 101.
   [before_mario_mags_books_05.JPG]
   In April of 2012, a piece based on my collection and blog appeared in
   Mexican game magazine GameMaster.
   [gamemaster_beforemario_02.jpg]
   [gamemaster_beforemario_03.jpg]
   Issue 106 from the UK publication Retro Gamer included a short piece by
   me, titled "Five Nintendo toys you've never played". It focussed on a
   handful of interesting games from Nintendo's past.
   [beforemario_in_retrogamer_106_02.JPG]
   [beforemario_in_retrogamer_106_04.JPG]
   The German Nintendo magazine N-Zone published a three part retro
   special on Nintendo's pre-Famicom days, using photos from my
   collection. It ran in issues October to December 2013. The full version
   can be seen here.
   [nzone_part3.jpg]
   In 2014, the Japanese Nintendo magazine Nintendo Dream published an
   extensive interview with me, in issues 11 and 12 of that year.
   [nindori_interview_02.JPG]
   The German magazine Der Spiegel published a nice story on their website
   in August 2015.

     * The History of Nintendo - part 1, by Florent Gorges (in
       collaboration with Isao Yamazaki), ISBN 978-2-918272-15-1
       [available in English, French, Italian and Spanish]

     * Gunpei Yokoi - Vie et philosophie du dieu des jouets Nintendo, by
       Takefumi Makino (in collaboration with Florent Gorges), ISBN
       978-2-918272-18-1 [available in French]

     * 任天堂コンプリートガイド 玩具編 (Nintendo Complete Guide - Toys), by Isao
       Yamazaki, ISBN 978-4072947579 [available in Japanese]

                      [before_mario_mags_books_02.JPG]
     Two of the best books on Nintendo's History (Pix'N Love Publishing)

   I recommend these books as great resources on Nintendo's early years
   (next to my own book, of course :-) ). Find out more about the authors
   Florent and Isao, who also happen to be great friends of mine.
