About

   Opened in December 2008, L'Artusi is named for Pellegrino Artusi,
   (1820-1911) and his self-published cookbook La Scienza in Cucina e
   L'Arte di Mangiare Bene (The Science of Cookery and the Art of Eating
   Well). L'Artusi presents a modern take on traditional Italian cuisine,
   combining comfort and creativity.

   Our wine program features a mostly Italian wine list, presented by
   region with a map of DOCs and DOCGs accompanied by traditional local
   dishes, helping to demystify Italy, the most diverse viticultural
   nation in the world.
   Our 110 seat restaurant, features two floors of comfortable banquette
   seating, extended traditional bar, cheese bar and a chef's counter
   overlooking the open kitchen. Private dining opportunities are also
   available in our 2500 bottle walk-in wine cellar.

    Joe Vigorito
    Executive Chef
       A native of Ohio, Joe Vigorito's earliest experiences in the
       restaurant industry were at his uncle's sub shop where he worked as
       a jack of all trades – from washing the dishes and bussing the
       tables to working the grill and serving customers. It wasn't until
       Joe was at The Ohio State University studying Social and Behavioral
       Sciences when he missed a home cooked meal did he begin to explore
       the culinary arts.
       Upon graduation, Joe enrolled at The French Culinary Institute and
       formally began his career as garde manger at Mario Batali's Lupa.
       Since then, Joe has worked in several of New York City's most
       cherished Italian restaurants including Morandi, Bar Milano, the
       well-loved but short lived Carmine Club Café, and The Eddy in the
       East Village.
       Not to be overlooked, he’s also spent time in several of the
       Epicurean Group’s kitchens, first as the sous chef of dell’anima
       and later as the executive sous chef of L’Artusi under his friend
       and mentor Gabe Thompson.  Thus, upon leaving Via Carota to assume
       the role of executive chef of L’Artusi back in September of 2016,
       it was more of a home coming to Joe, and he couldn’t be happier.

    Pastry Chef
       Having grown up in a large Jamaican family, Jessica Craig always
       had an interest in food and an adventurous palate. She began
       helping her mother in the family kitchen from a very young age, and
       soon became responsible for all family holiday desserts at the age
       of 12. From there, the next step for Jessica was culinary school to
       pursue her love of cooking. After stints in the Hamptons and
       Locanda Verde, she joined the L’Artusi family as Executive Pastry
       Chef in 2017.
       Jessica finds inspiration in farmer’s markets, international travel
       and exploring acclaimed restaurants. When she’s not in the kitchen,
       she can be found spending time with family and friends, collecting
       Barbies and at dance cardio classes.
       Jessica has been featured in The New York Times, The Michelin Guide
       Blog, Pastry Arts Magazine, and Essence.
