Facial Recognition ‘Epidemic’ in the UK

   16th August 2019 by BigBrotherWatch

   An investigation by Big Brother Watch has uncovered a facial
   recognition ‘epidemic’ across privately owned sites in the UK.

   The civil liberties campaign group has found major property developers,
   shopping centres, museums, conference centres and casinos using the
   technology in the UK.

   Millions of shoppers scanned

   Their investigation uncovered the use of live facial recognition in
   Sheffield’s Meadowhall, one of the biggest shopping centres in the
   North of England, in secret police trials that took place last year.
   The trial could have scanned the faces of over 2 million visitors.

   The shopping centre is owned by British Land, which owns large areas
   within London including parts of Paddington, Broadgate, Canada Water
   and Ealing Broadway. Each site’s privacy policy says facial recognition
   may be in use, although British Land insists only Meadowhall has used
   the surveillance so far.

   Last week, the Financial Times revealed that the privately owned Kings
   Cross estate in London was using facial recognition, whilst Canary
   Wharf is considering following suit. The expose prompted widespread
   concerns and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to write to the estate to
   express his concerns. The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has
   launched an investigation.

   Last year, the Trafford Centre in Manchester was pressured to stop
   using live facial recognition surveillance following an intervention by
   the Surveillance Camera Commissioner. It was estimated that up to 15
   million people were scanned during the operation.

   “Dark irony” of China exhibition visitors scanned

   Big Brother Watch’s investigation has also revealed that Liverpool’s
   World Museum scanned visitors with facial recognition surveillance
   during its exhibition, “China’s First Emperor and the Terracotta
   Warriors” in 2018. Director of Big Brother Watch Silkie Carlo described
   it as “dark irony” noting that “this authoritarian surveillance tool is
   rarely seen outside of China” and warning that “many of those scanned
   will have been school children”.

   The museum is part of the National Museums Liverpool group, which also
   includes the International Slavery Museum, the Museum of Liverpool and
   other museums and art galleries. The museum group said it is “currently
   testing feasibility of using similar technology in the future”.

   “Eroding freedom of association”

   Big Brother Watch’s investigation also found that the Millennium Point
   conference centre in Birmingham uses facial recognition surveillance
   “at the request of law enforcement”, according to its privacy policy.
   In recent years, the area surrounding the conference centre has been
   used for demonstrations by trade unionists, football fans and
   anti-racism campaigners. The centre refused to give further information
   about its past or present uses of facial recognition surveillance.
   Millennium Point is soon to host a ‘hackathon’.

   A number of casinos and betting shops also have policies that refer to
   their use of facial recognition technology including Ladbrokes, Coral
   and Hippodrome Casino London.

   Director of Big Brother Watch, Silkie Carlo, said:

     There is an epidemic of facial recognition in the UK.

     The collusion between police and private companies in building these
     surveillance nets around popular spaces is deeply disturbing. Facial
     recognition is the perfect tool of oppression and the widespread use
     we’ve found indicates we’re facing a privacy emergency.

     We now know that many millions of innocent people will have had
     their faces scanned with this surveillance without knowing about it,
     whether by police or by private companies.

     The idea of a British museum secretly scanning the faces of children
     visiting an exhibition on the first emperor of China is chilling.
     There is a dark irony that this authoritarian surveillance tool is
     rarely seen outside of China.

     Facial recognition surveillance risks making privacy in Britain
     extinct.

     Parliament must follow in the footsteps of legislators in the US and
     urgently ban this authoritarian surveillance from public spaces.

Sky News – Privacy campaigners warn of facial recognition epidemic

   16th August 201913th September 2019 by BigBrotherWatch

   Our investigation uncovered a facial recognition epidemic across
   privately owned sites in the UK, some even secretly running in
   conjunction with police foces.

   This includes large urban areas like Kings Cross in London, major
   property developers, shopping centres, museums, conference centres and
   casinos – all using authoritarian and lawless live facial recognition
   surveillance in the UK.

   Director of Big Brother Watch, Silkie Carlo, said:

     There is an epidemic of facial recognition in the UK.

     The collusion between police and private companies in building these
     surveillance nets around popular spaces is deeply disturbing. Facial

     we’ve found indicates we’re facing a privacy emergency.

     We now know that many millions of innocent people will have had
