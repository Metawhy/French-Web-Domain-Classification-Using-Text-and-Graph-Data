Welcome to IJCAI-19

IJCAI-19
August 10-16, 2019, Macao, China

   Welcome to IJCAI 2019, the 28th International Joint Conference on
   Artificial Intelligence. This will be the second time that IJCAI is
   held in China: the first time was 2013 in Beijing, the capital of this
   large country. Macao is the single most consistent example of cultural
   interchange between Europe and Asia; the official languages are Chinese
   and Portuguese. Having developed into a bustling city with a worldwide
   reputation in entertainment, Macao is also at the heart of the
   Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which promotes its fast
   development in IT education, research, and industry in recent years.

   Macao is easy to travel to: it is connected directly to Hong Kong
   International Airport and Shenzhen International Airport by high-speed
   ferry, which is only a 60 minutes journey. The longest bridge in the
   world connecting Hong Kong and Macao is supposed to be opened in late
   2018; this will further reduce the transfer time. Macao International
   Airport is just located in the city center, about five minutes drive to
   the hotel and convention centers. Macao can be entered without visa or
   with one issued on arrival for most countries; visitors from over 200
   countries enjoy this policy.

   IJCAI 2019 will take place in the convention center of the Venetian
   Macao Hotel Resort, which is located on the Cotai Strip, the heart of
   modern Macao’s accommodation, event and entertainment offerings. The
   Cotai Strip is a stretch of reclaimed land that now joins the islands
   of Coloane and Taipa. It is close to all the major entry points to
   Macao, by land, sea or air and with easy access to Macao’s many points
   of historical and cultural interest. Furthermore, it provides modern
   infrastructure and a choice from thousands of rooms in a suite of
   hotels, bars and lounges, theatres, shopping malls, etc. Conference
   delegates will enjoy an evening reception at the beautiful new campus
   of the University of Macau and a banquet dinner at the world’s largest
   casino property.

   Attend IJCAI 2019, and enjoy a unique city where far-east and west meet
   in long tradition, while taking part in the leading Artificial
   Intelligence gathering. Don’t miss the opportunity of side visits to
   Hong Kong and other exciting places close by.
