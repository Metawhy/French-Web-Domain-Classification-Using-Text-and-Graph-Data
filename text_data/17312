   1. All 3 of my kids still nap at the same time, but I would still love
   to make these. Sometimes nap time is not enough quiet time!

   2.  Some day I will have a craft room.

   yellow door.

Photo Challenge Update

   Do you remember the photo challenge I posted at the end of 2014? I
   hoped to do an update every other week, but we are 3 whole months into
   the year and this is only my third update. It has been a busy new year
   with a new baby, a move that has brought lots of change and adjustment
   and a new job for me. I am grateful for this challenge though, because
   it has forced me to take out my "nice camera" and play around with it,
   which I do not get to do nearly enough. I have kind of put my desire to
   really learn how to use it on the back burner. Here is my update.
   Remember, I have not yet done any editing, so this is the best that I
   can do for now.

Marriage Monday: Spouse vs kids- Finding a balance

   I love Dr. Matt Townsend.  He is a relationship coach, life coach and
   communication expert. My husband and I have gone to his Date Night and
   laughed so hard and left feeling uplifted and determined to grow closer
   together. I have also done his Life Changer program. I am a huge fan!
   Watch this short 8 minute video with some great insight and reminders
   to find balance in your marriage.

   1. Find the compliment not the critique.
   2. Lose the excuse that you do not have time. Invest your time it what
   really matters.
   3. Focus on the important and not the urgent.
   4. You have to get time together on the schedule. Every single day. If
   it's not on the schedule, it's not going to happen!

   1. I am making these labels for inside my children's dresser so they
   can better put their clothes away.
   Find the free printable here.

   2. Just placed an order for bows. I love Bloomies Handmade.

   3. I think this is a cute, simple idea.
   [cf213c1765ad300147860c09bd985afa.jpg]
   4. We broke down and bought a Blendtec. Well, I did... for my husband's
   birthday, but if I didn't buy you better believe he would have got it
   in the very near future... like his next trip to Costco. Excited to
   make some delicious smoothies. This rise and shine smoothie looks
   delish and is on my list to try.

   5. I have decided to become an Usborne Book rep. I love children's
   books and am passionate about early childhood literacy. Want to check
   out some of the titles? Check here.

Marriage Monday: Add some sweetness to your marriage!

   Does your hubby like sweetness as much as mine? My poor husband is
   sweet deprived most of the time because if I keep it around I will eat
   it, so I just don't get it very often. I thought these little love
   notes (free printable) that go along with candy bars were fun. Check
   them out here.  Don't see what you are looking for? Check out this list
   of sayings for just about every candy out there!

Marriage Monday: Geocaching Date

   One of my favorite dates is geocaching.
   What is geocaching? Watch this short video if you are not familiar with
   it.

   IFRAME:
   http://www.youtube.com/embed/1YTqitVK-Ts?feature=player_embedded

   Check out this site. There are so many geocaches out there you wouldn't
   even believe it! There are 846 geocaches near me! It's exciting, a
   unique date, fun and free! We get to work together and laugh together!
   There is also a mobile app. Just search "geocaching" in the app store.
   If you try this out or have done it before, comment and let me know
   what you think of it!
