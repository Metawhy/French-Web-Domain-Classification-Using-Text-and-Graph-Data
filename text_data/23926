D17 - Neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry

   D17, is a neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry
   (vertical surfaces) designed to be as flexible as possible in
   resolution and modes of operation. It is suitable for the study of
   surface structures in solids and solid/liquid interfaces over a wide
   range of length scales.

Applications

     * The study of surfaces and buried interfaces of thin solid films and
       multilayers
     * Solid-liquid interfaces and membranes
     * Examination of off-specular reflectivity from atomic and magnetic
       in-plane structure
     * Kinetic studies of interface evolution.

Instrument layout

   D17 operates in four modes:
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), non-polarised
       This is achieved by a double chopper system using wavelengths from
       2 to 27 Å with great flexibility in resolution. This mode can
       simultaneously cover an order of magnitude in q in less than a
       minute, allowing the time evolution of a sample to be followed
       (kinetics). TOF-GISANS is also possible.
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), polarised beam
       This is achieved by using an S-bender polarising the TOF beam in a
       selectable wavelength range with high polarisation. Pol TOF-GISANS
       and kinetic studies also possible.
     * Monochromatic, non-polarised
       The non-poarised angle dispersive mode (high flux at 5.5 Å used
       over the entire q-range). Not suitable for kinetic studies as each
       point in q must be measured sequentially. GISANS possible.
     * Monochromatic, polarised beam
       For the study of magnetic samples with a choice of polarisation
       analysis between a supermirror for the specular beam and a 3He cell
       covering the wide solid angle of the multidetector for off-specular
       studies. The instrument is ideal for the measurement of
       off-specular scattering arising from large scale in-plane
       structure, glancing incidence small angle scattering (GISANS) from
       smaller scale in-plane structure.

Small-Angle Neutron Scattering

   Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measures diffracted neutrons at
   very small angles of scattering and it requires a very long instrument
   to resolve the small angles. SANS is used to investigate structures
   with large interatomic distances such as polymers or large molecular
   assemblies  and it is the ideal method to examinestructure on length
   scales of 1 to 1000nm.
   An important method for neutron small-angle scattering experiments is
   isotopic substitution (e.g. hydrogen by deuterium). Different spectra
   varying the scattering length density of one phase are then recorded
   for the same system which represents a severe test to check the
   validity of the proposed models.

organisation of microstructures

   You want to optimise your products? You need to analyse how your
   preparations behave? Why not use SANS?

   Small-Angle Neutron Scattering
   SANS lets you to explore the microstructure of liquids and solids at
   scales ranging from 1 nanometre to one tenth of a micron.

   What's so important about microstructure? Imagine you want to
   manufacture a shampoo, with a brand new active molecule. The problem
   with active molecules is that they are often hydrophobic: they don't
   dilute well in water. The shampoo is an aqueous preparation used within
   water. The active molecules are encapsulated in aggregates of
   surfactants, but these mixtures are very liquid and not very practical
   to use... so a thickener is also added to the mixture. But
   manufacturers don't want an excessively viscous, glue-like product
   difficult to get out of the bottle.

   So, how do you best proportion each ingredient to obtain an attractive
   shampoo that is stable over a broad temperature range and over time -
   and which is also easy to rinse. This is when things start to get
   really tricky. SANS measurements help you optimise your formulation:
   they let you observe how the molecules in your shampoo are organised.

   How does this work? A product sample is placed in a SANS instrument.
   The instrument is temperature-controlled and the injection system
   allows for blending if necessary. A beam of neutrons is directed at the
   sample. The matter of the shampoo deflects some neutrons from their
   trajectory. A large detector records the positions of the deflected
   neutrons. The results are a set of curious figures which experts will
   analyse. This measurement makes it possible to determinate the shape,
   sizes, and spatial organisation of the scatters in your shampoo,
   ranging from 1 nanometre to one tenth of a micron. It's even possible
   to detail the size and nature of the lipids layers or bilayers - the
   barriers that encapsulate the active molecules. SANS is a ver important
   technique applied to many different systems: polymers, colloids,
   biological macromolecules, emulsions, pores in solids, aggregates in
   alloys, and even magnetic microstructures. It can give you a novel
   perspective on the organisation of microstructures.

November 2018: an exciting future for small-angle neutron scattering

   At the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) researchers from a range of fields
   are utilising the world’s most powerful instruments for small angle
   neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate the structures of many
   materials across sizes ranging from 1-100 nanometres. These include
   polymers, alloys, and biological macromolecules. SANS offers
   significant advantages compared to other probes. In particular,
   neutrons are less destructive than other forms of radiation, such as
   X-rays – they do not damage sensitive biological samples – and they can
   be used to detect magnetic properties thanks to their magnetic moment.

   SANS has proven to be a powerful technique addressing a number of
   societal challenges, such as discovering better drugs and understanding
   superconductors. Three recent publications have emerged from ILL that
   demonstrate the success and importance of SANS for scientific progress
   across a range of research fields. They highlight the power of SANS in
   increasing our understanding of how molecules behave in different
   solvents, how currents and magnetic fields behave in superconductors,
   and what processes we might be able to analyse in the future using this
   technique.

   Conformation of drugs in the body

   Scientists from Kyoto University, Tohoku University, The University of
   Tokyo and ILL were the first to apply SANS to the conformational
   analysis of synthetic helical macromolecules. As published in the
   Journal of the American Chemical Society, scientists used the D22
   instrument as well as the super-computer at the Institute for Chemical
   Research, Kyoto University. The helix is a very important shape in
   biology – systems built using helices show great structural strength –
   and is found in critical macromolecules including polypeptides and
   polysaccharides, which make up proteins and carbohydrates, and DNA, the
   molecule of life.
   This study looked at inherently ‘racemic’ polymer main chains, which
   are in an equilibrium between right and left-handed helical structures
   in solution at ambient temperature. The researchers set out to explore
   the phenomenon whereby the side chains of the helix, which are ‘chiral’
   in contrast, transfer this characteristic to the main chain of the
   helix and cause it to appear to twist or contract. A change in this
   conformation is often observed when external conditions, such as the
   solvent, are changed. However, how the solvent plays a part in the
   transfer of this structural characteristic is yet to be explored at a
   molecular level. It could have significant practical applications, such
   as predicting how drugs behave in the body, but understanding the
   process is critical to exploiting it. Though SANS techniques have
   recently been used to examine bio-macromolecule structures in solution,
   the group was the first to use SANS to explore the puzzle of
   solvent-dependent switching, and the first to outline the
   characteristics of this behaviour.

   Our D22 instrument was key in this research – the world-leading SANS
   instrument is especially suited to probing a variety of samples as the
   setup is very flexible, accommodating different experimental
   environments. This technique allowed the helix to be studied in
   high-resolution and produced detailed structural information. Features
   such as side chains could be visualised according to the pattern
   produced by neutrons. SANS with selectively deuterated samples is the
   only technique capable of distinguishing the side chains from the main
   backbone of the helix – X-ray scattering simply would not produce a
   scattering pattern with enough detail to differentiate between these
   distinct features. By examining the polymers using this technique, the
   researchers discovered that a subtle difference in how strongly the
   side-chains of the helix were bound to the solvent – i.e. the degree of
   solvation – was a main factor that induced the difference in
   conformation.

   Using this data, the researchers could confirm the preferred
   confirmation of the side-chains in the two different solvents. In the
   first solvent one side chain extended towards the solvent, while the
   other was tight against the main chain. This was a stronger degree of
   solvation, and resulted in a right-handed helical structure. In the
   second solvent, the solvation was weaker, as the side-chains were
   folded in towards the main helical backbone due to their preference to
   interact with each other or the main backbone. This caused the
   macromolecule to form a shrunken, contracted helix. The novel use of
   SANS to explore and explain solvent-dependent switching demonstrates
   what a powerful tool this technique may be for increasing our
   understanding of this switching process. This knowledge may impact the
   pharmaceutical industry and drug development, as the left or
   right-handed, helical, macromolecular catalysts will selectively
   generate enantiopure drugs, with a specific form that allows any side
   effects in our bodies to be minimised.

   Expanding the use of superconductors

   Another study published inNature Communications from researchers at the
   Technical University of Denmark, University of Fribourg, University of
   Birmingham, and ILL, explores the use of SANS to probe the vortex order
   of superconductors - materials that allow electrical currents to flow
   through them with zero resistance when the temperature is lowered below
   a critical point. Most superconductors are Type-II, which means they
   exhibit a ‘vortex state’ and often have high critical magnetic fields,
   above which the superconductor loses its superconductivity.

   This study also used the D22 instrument at ILL to probe a Type-II
   superconductor, vanadium, using SANS. Researchers examined the vortex
   order in a vanadium crystal and provided experimental evidence for the
   Bragg glass phenomenon, where vortex diffraction peaks are reshaped due
   to disorder within the superconductor. Without SANS, the transition
   point between the Bragg glass state and a disordered ‘vortex glass’
   could not be identified – most previous studies characterising the
   states observed in this research did not involve directly probing the
   vortex order, and numerous assumptions were made in an attempt to
   understand macroscopic phenomena, which are yet to be fully understood.

   This is important research as superconductors are widely used in
   magnets, for example in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). By improving
   our understanding of how superconducting wires function under different
   conditions, and what occurs at these intriguing vortex states, we can
   in turn improve their capabilities when used in applications. Further
   research into the Bragg glass phenomenon could bring us closer to
   superconductors that function more effectively at elevated magnetic
   fields in applications such as MRI, thus impacting the healthcare
   landscape.

   Optimising SANS for the future of neutron research

   Given the potential of SANS to help a range of potential scientific
   fields, including biology and medicine, and improve our understanding
   of materials, other researchers at ILL are focusing on optimising the
   experimental technique, in a way that may particularly benefit specific
   fields.

   Recently, researchers from the Technical University of Berlin, using
   the D11 instrument at ILL, successfully developed a new sample
   environment for SANS, publishing their work in Scientific Reports. This
   new development will allow ongoing chemical reactions to be observed
   in-situ via SANS.

   The significance of this progress is quite clear when compared to
   previous work. The standard use of a SANS instrument is to measure
   samples in a “static” manner. In this case, the samples are prepared
   beforehand and the structures that are measured are those of the final
   or equilibrium state. In many cases this is sufficient, however, there
   are also cases where researchers would like more detail about how these
   structures form and how they react to changing chemical environments.
   The continuous-flow method allows these structural transitions to be
   observed as they occur, and, together with a combination of
   complementary chemical characterisation techniques, provides a more
   complete picture of how samples change during rapid or sensitive
   chemical processes. Such experiments are especially useful for
   establishing the relationship between the function or properties of
   materials and their structure at the nanoscale, particularly in the
   case of polymeric or biological systems.

   The researchers successfully demonstrated their new sample environment
   using the D11 instrument at ILL. They investigated an aqueous
   surfactant solution (the primary ingredient of household and personal
   cleaning products), which undergoes significant structural changes in
   response to a change in pH, in order to demonstrate the benefits of the
   continuous-flow method. The sample was observed and characterised over
   the course of a potentiometric titration. This process is similar to a
   classical titration experiment using indicators that respond to pH and
   result in colour changes, but the progress of the reaction is instead
   tracked through electrodes that measure the effective concentration of
   hydrogen ions. They found that their method was efficient in enabling
   the collection of a great deal of structural detail on the sample as it
   changed in response to differences in pH.

   The paper indicates that the understanding of reactions in biological
   samples and soft-matter structures will be significantly enhanced by
   this new SANS sample environment. Although similar techniques have
   previously been used on SAXS instruments (the X-ray analogue of SANS),
   they may not be as well suited for biological and soft-matter samples.
   Not only can high intensity X-rays damage or destroy sensitive samples,
   the lack of contrast between organic materials can also make it
   difficult to get precise information on more complex, multicomponent
   structures. Expanding the range of experiments that can be performed on
   SANS instruments will provide scientists with more tools to investigate
   complex soft-matter systems undergoing chemical change. This may be of
   particular benefit to the fields of molecular biology and biochemistry
   where the interplay between the chemistry, structure and function of
   macromolecules is often complex and not well understood.

   With our world-leading SANS instruments at their fingertips, the
   researchers from the Technical University of Berlin have opened doors
   for future researchers across biological and soft-matter communities
   wishing to utilise the impressive power and flexibility of SANS
   instruments for their studies.

   As these three stories show, whether probing deep into unexplored
   states of matter, or examining the structures which are core to our
   biological make-up, SANS is allowing scientists to examine the world
   around us with more detail than ever before. Research across all
   scientific fields can benefit from a fundamental understanding of the
   molecular mechanisms and structures at play in their research, and the
   continued upgrading and refinement of the SANS technique, such as the
   development of new sample environments as we have discussed, will make
   SANS an even more accessible and useful tool for science.

   The D11 and D22 instruments at ILL were used for small angle neutron
   scattering experiments (SANS) in these studies.

D33 - Massive dynamic q-range small-angle diffractometer

   D33 is a Small-Angle Neutron Scattering instrument for the
   characterization of samples with typical sizes varying from the
   nanometer scale to few tenth of micrometer. In addition to a standard
   monochromatic mode of operation, D33 offers a time of flight mode (TOF)
   to cover an enhanced dynamic q-range q[max]/q[min] in one instrument
   setting.
   High magnetic fields, up to 17 T at the sample position, beam
   polarization and ^3He spin analysis, facilitate and expand studies of
   magnetism and allow a more quantitative analysis of spin incoherent
   samples. The high flux allows for kinetic experiments with time
   resolution of the order of few milliseconds.

Applications

     * Soft condensed Matter:
       organic and inorganic colloidal particles; polymers blends or
       polymer in solution, gels, liquid crystals; self assembly of
       surfactant molecules.
     * Biology:
       proteins, nucleic acids, biomembranes, vectors for drug delivery.
     * Material Science:
       phase separation in alloys and glasses, morphologies of
       superalloys, microporosity in ceramics, interfaces and surfaces of
       catalysts.
     * Magnetism:
       Flux line lattices in superconductors; magnetic correlations.

Layout shown in three parts

     * Top:
       neutron selection either with a neutron velocity selector
       (monochromatic mode) or with choppers (time of flight mode)
     * Middle:
       collimation part
     * Bottom:
       front and rear detector moving in the vacuum tube from 1.2 m to
       12.8 m after the sample position.

D17 - Neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry

   D17, is a neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry
   (vertical surfaces) designed to be as flexible as possible in
   resolution and modes of operation. It is suitable for the study of
   surface structures in solids and solid/liquid interfaces over a wide
   range of length scales.

Applications

     * The study of surfaces and buried interfaces of thin solid films and
       multilayers
     * Solid-liquid interfaces and membranes
     * Examination of off-specular reflectivity from atomic and magnetic
       in-plane structure
     * Kinetic studies of interface evolution.

Instrument layout

   D17 operates in four modes:
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), non-polarised
       This is achieved by a double chopper system using wavelengths from
       2 to 27 Å with great flexibility in resolution. This mode can
       simultaneously cover an order of magnitude in q in less than a
       minute, allowing the time evolution of a sample to be followed
       (kinetics). TOF-GISANS is also possible.
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), polarised beam
       This is achieved by using an S-bender polarising the TOF beam in a
       selectable wavelength range with high polarisation. Pol TOF-GISANS
       and kinetic studies also possible.
     * Monochromatic, non-polarised
       The non-poarised angle dispersive mode (high flux at 5.5 Å used
       over the entire q-range). Not suitable for kinetic studies as each
       point in q must be measured sequentially. GISANS possible.
     * Monochromatic, polarised beam
       For the study of magnetic samples with a choice of polarisation
       analysis between a supermirror for the specular beam and a 3He cell
       covering the wide solid angle of the multidetector for off-specular
       studies. The instrument is ideal for the measurement of
       off-specular scattering arising from large scale in-plane
       structure, glancing incidence small angle scattering (GISANS) from
       smaller scale in-plane structure.

Small-Angle Neutron Scattering

   Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measures diffracted neutrons at
   very small angles of scattering and it requires a very long instrument
   to resolve the small angles. SANS is used to investigate structures
   with large interatomic distances such as polymers or large molecular
   assemblies  and it is the ideal method to examinestructure on length
   scales of 1 to 1000nm.
   An important method for neutron small-angle scattering experiments is
   isotopic substitution (e.g. hydrogen by deuterium). Different spectra
   varying the scattering length density of one phase are then recorded
   for the same system which represents a severe test to check the
   validity of the proposed models.

organisation of microstructures

   preparations behave? Why not use SANS?

   SANS lets you to explore the microstructure of liquids and solids at
   scales ranging from 1 nanometre to one tenth of a micron.

   What's so important about microstructure? Imagine you want to
   manufacture a shampoo, with a brand new active molecule. The problem
   with active molecules is that they are often hydrophobic: they don't
   dilute well in water. The shampoo is an aqueous preparation used within
   water. The active molecules are encapsulated in aggregates of
   surfactants, but these mixtures are very liquid and not very practical
   to use... so a thickener is also added to the mixture. But
   manufacturers don't want an excessively viscous, glue-like product
   difficult to get out of the bottle.

   So, how do you best proportion each ingredient to obtain an attractive
   shampoo that is stable over a broad temperature range and over time -
   and which is also easy to rinse. This is when things start to get
   really tricky. SANS measurements help you optimise your formulation:
   they let you observe how the molecules in your shampoo are organised.

   How does this work? A product sample is placed in a SANS instrument.
   The instrument is temperature-controlled and the injection system
   allows for blending if necessary. A beam of neutrons is directed at the
   sample. The matter of the shampoo deflects some neutrons from their
   trajectory. A large detector records the positions of the deflected
   neutrons. The results are a set of curious figures which experts will
   analyse. This measurement makes it possible to determinate the shape,
   sizes, and spatial organisation of the scatters in your shampoo,
   ranging from 1 nanometre to one tenth of a micron. It's even possible
   to detail the size and nature of the lipids layers or bilayers - the
   barriers that encapsulate the active molecules. SANS is a ver important
   technique applied to many different systems: polymers, colloids,
   biological macromolecules, emulsions, pores in solids, aggregates in
   alloys, and even magnetic microstructures. It can give you a novel
   perspective on the organisation of microstructures.

November 2018: an exciting future for small-angle neutron scattering

   At the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) researchers from a range of fields
   are utilising the world’s most powerful instruments for small angle
   neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate the structures of many
   materials across sizes ranging from 1-100 nanometres. These include
   polymers, alloys, and biological macromolecules. SANS offers
   significant advantages compared to other probes. In particular,
   neutrons are less destructive than other forms of radiation, such as
   X-rays – they do not damage sensitive biological samples – and they can
   be used to detect magnetic properties thanks to their magnetic moment.

   SANS has proven to be a powerful technique addressing a number of
   societal challenges, such as discovering better drugs and understanding
   superconductors. Three recent publications have emerged from ILL that
   demonstrate the success and importance of SANS for scientific progress
   across a range of research fields. They highlight the power of SANS in
   increasing our understanding of how molecules behave in different
   solvents, how currents and magnetic fields behave in superconductors,
   and what processes we might be able to analyse in the future using this
   technique.

   Conformation of drugs in the body

   Scientists from Kyoto University, Tohoku University, The University of
   Tokyo and ILL were the first to apply SANS to the conformational
   analysis of synthetic helical macromolecules. As published in the
   Journal of the American Chemical Society, scientists used the D22
   instrument as well as the super-computer at the Institute for Chemical
   Research, Kyoto University. The helix is a very important shape in
   biology – systems built using helices show great structural strength –
   and is found in critical macromolecules including polypeptides and
   polysaccharides, which make up proteins and carbohydrates, and DNA, the
   molecule of life.
   This study looked at inherently ‘racemic’ polymer main chains, which
   are in an equilibrium between right and left-handed helical structures
   in solution at ambient temperature. The researchers set out to explore
   the phenomenon whereby the side chains of the helix, which are ‘chiral’
   in contrast, transfer this characteristic to the main chain of the
   helix and cause it to appear to twist or contract. A change in this
   conformation is often observed when external conditions, such as the
   solvent, are changed. However, how the solvent plays a part in the
   transfer of this structural characteristic is yet to be explored at a
   molecular level. It could have significant practical applications, such
   as predicting how drugs behave in the body, but understanding the
   process is critical to exploiting it. Though SANS techniques have
   recently been used to examine bio-macromolecule structures in solution,
   the group was the first to use SANS to explore the puzzle of
   solvent-dependent switching, and the first to outline the
   characteristics of this behaviour.

   Our D22 instrument was key in this research – the world-leading SANS
   instrument is especially suited to probing a variety of samples as the
   setup is very flexible, accommodating different experimental
   environments. This technique allowed the helix to be studied in
   high-resolution and produced detailed structural information. Features
   such as side chains could be visualised according to the pattern
   produced by neutrons. SANS with selectively deuterated samples is the
   only technique capable of distinguishing the side chains from the main
   backbone of the helix – X-ray scattering simply would not produce a
   scattering pattern with enough detail to differentiate between these
   distinct features. By examining the polymers using this technique, the
   researchers discovered that a subtle difference in how strongly the
   side-chains of the helix were bound to the solvent – i.e. the degree of
   solvation – was a main factor that induced the difference in
   conformation.

   Using this data, the researchers could confirm the preferred
   confirmation of the side-chains in the two different solvents. In the
   first solvent one side chain extended towards the solvent, while the
   other was tight against the main chain. This was a stronger degree of
   solvation, and resulted in a right-handed helical structure. In the
   second solvent, the solvation was weaker, as the side-chains were
   folded in towards the main helical backbone due to their preference to
   interact with each other or the main backbone. This caused the
   macromolecule to form a shrunken, contracted helix. The novel use of
   SANS to explore and explain solvent-dependent switching demonstrates
   what a powerful tool this technique may be for increasing our
   understanding of this switching process. This knowledge may impact the
   pharmaceutical industry and drug development, as the left or
   right-handed, helical, macromolecular catalysts will selectively
   generate enantiopure drugs, with a specific form that allows any side
   effects in our bodies to be minimised.

   Expanding the use of superconductors

   Another study published inNature Communications from researchers at the
   Technical University of Denmark, University of Fribourg, University of
   Birmingham, and ILL, explores the use of SANS to probe the vortex order
   of superconductors - materials that allow electrical currents to flow
   through them with zero resistance when the temperature is lowered below
   a critical point. Most superconductors are Type-II, which means they
   exhibit a ‘vortex state’ and often have high critical magnetic fields,
   above which the superconductor loses its superconductivity.

   This study also used the D22 instrument at ILL to probe a Type-II
   superconductor, vanadium, using SANS. Researchers examined the vortex
   order in a vanadium crystal and provided experimental evidence for the
   Bragg glass phenomenon, where vortex diffraction peaks are reshaped due
   to disorder within the superconductor. Without SANS, the transition
   point between the Bragg glass state and a disordered ‘vortex glass’
   could not be identified – most previous studies characterising the
   states observed in this research did not involve directly probing the
   vortex order, and numerous assumptions were made in an attempt to
   understand macroscopic phenomena, which are yet to be fully understood.

   This is important research as superconductors are widely used in
   magnets, for example in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). By improving
   our understanding of how superconducting wires function under different
   conditions, and what occurs at these intriguing vortex states, we can
   in turn improve their capabilities when used in applications. Further
   research into the Bragg glass phenomenon could bring us closer to
   superconductors that function more effectively at elevated magnetic
   fields in applications such as MRI, thus impacting the healthcare
   landscape.

   Optimising SANS for the future of neutron research

   Given the potential of SANS to help a range of potential scientific
   fields, including biology and medicine, and improve our understanding
   of materials, other researchers at ILL are focusing on optimising the
   experimental technique, in a way that may particularly benefit specific
   fields.

   Recently, researchers from the Technical University of Berlin, using
   the D11 instrument at ILL, successfully developed a new sample
   environment for SANS, publishing their work in Scientific Reports. This
   new development will allow ongoing chemical reactions to be observed
   in-situ via SANS.

   The significance of this progress is quite clear when compared to
   previous work. The standard use of a SANS instrument is to measure
   samples in a “static” manner. In this case, the samples are prepared
   beforehand and the structures that are measured are those of the final
   or equilibrium state. In many cases this is sufficient, however, there
   are also cases where researchers would like more detail about how these
   structures form and how they react to changing chemical environments.
   The continuous-flow method allows these structural transitions to be
   observed as they occur, and, together with a combination of
   complementary chemical characterisation techniques, provides a more
   complete picture of how samples change during rapid or sensitive
   chemical processes. Such experiments are especially useful for
   establishing the relationship between the function or properties of
   materials and their structure at the nanoscale, particularly in the
   case of polymeric or biological systems.

   The researchers successfully demonstrated their new sample environment
   using the D11 instrument at ILL. They investigated an aqueous
   surfactant solution (the primary ingredient of household and personal
   cleaning products), which undergoes significant structural changes in
   response to a change in pH, in order to demonstrate the benefits of the
   continuous-flow method. The sample was observed and characterised over
   the course of a potentiometric titration. This process is similar to a
   classical titration experiment using indicators that respond to pH and
   result in colour changes, but the progress of the reaction is instead
   tracked through electrodes that measure the effective concentration of
   hydrogen ions. They found that their method was efficient in enabling
   the collection of a great deal of structural detail on the sample as it
   changed in response to differences in pH.

   The paper indicates that the understanding of reactions in biological
   samples and soft-matter structures will be significantly enhanced by
   this new SANS sample environment. Although similar techniques have
   previously been used on SAXS instruments (the X-ray analogue of SANS),
   they may not be as well suited for biological and soft-matter samples.
   Not only can high intensity X-rays damage or destroy sensitive samples,
   the lack of contrast between organic materials can also make it
   difficult to get precise information on more complex, multicomponent
   structures. Expanding the range of experiments that can be performed on
   SANS instruments will provide scientists with more tools to investigate
   complex soft-matter systems undergoing chemical change. This may be of
   particular benefit to the fields of molecular biology and biochemistry
   where the interplay between the chemistry, structure and function of
   macromolecules is often complex and not well understood.

   With our world-leading SANS instruments at their fingertips, the
   researchers from the Technical University of Berlin have opened doors
   for future researchers across biological and soft-matter communities
   wishing to utilise the impressive power and flexibility of SANS
   instruments for their studies.

   As these three stories show, whether probing deep into unexplored
   states of matter, or examining the structures which are core to our
   biological make-up, SANS is allowing scientists to examine the world
   around us with more detail than ever before. Research across all
   scientific fields can benefit from a fundamental understanding of the
   molecular mechanisms and structures at play in their research, and the
   continued upgrading and refinement of the SANS technique, such as the
   development of new sample environments as we have discussed, will make
   SANS an even more accessible and useful tool for science.

   The D11 and D22 instruments at ILL were used for small angle neutron
   scattering experiments (SANS) in these studies.

D33 - Massive dynamic q-range small-angle diffractometer

   D33 is a Small-Angle Neutron Scattering instrument for the
   characterization of samples with typical sizes varying from the
   nanometer scale to few tenth of micrometer. In addition to a standard
   monochromatic mode of operation, D33 offers a time of flight mode (TOF)
   to cover an enhanced dynamic q-range q[max]/q[min] in one instrument
   setting.
   High magnetic fields, up to 17 T at the sample position, beam
   polarization and ^3He spin analysis, facilitate and expand studies of
   magnetism and allow a more quantitative analysis of spin incoherent
   samples. The high flux allows for kinetic experiments with time
   resolution of the order of few milliseconds.

Applications

     * Soft condensed Matter:
       organic and inorganic colloidal particles; polymers blends or
       polymer in solution, gels, liquid crystals; self assembly of
       surfactant molecules.
     * Biology:
       proteins, nucleic acids, biomembranes, vectors for drug delivery.
     * Material Science:
       phase separation in alloys and glasses, morphologies of
       superalloys, microporosity in ceramics, interfaces and surfaces of
       catalysts.
     * Magnetism:
       Flux line lattices in superconductors; magnetic correlations.

Layout shown in three parts

     * Top:
       neutron selection either with a neutron velocity selector
       (monochromatic mode) or with choppers (time of flight mode)
     * Middle:
       collimation part
     * Bottom:
       front and rear detector moving in the vacuum tube from 1.2 m to
       12.8 m after the sample position.

D17 - Neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry

   D17, is a neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry
   (vertical surfaces) designed to be as flexible as possible in
   resolution and modes of operation. It is suitable for the study of
   surface structures in solids and solid/liquid interfaces over a wide
   range of length scales.

Applications

     * The study of surfaces and buried interfaces of thin solid films and
       multilayers
     * Solid-liquid interfaces and membranes
     * Examination of off-specular reflectivity from atomic and magnetic
       in-plane structure
     * Kinetic studies of interface evolution.

Instrument layout

   D17 operates in four modes:
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), non-polarised
       This is achieved by a double chopper system using wavelengths from
       2 to 27 Å with great flexibility in resolution. This mode can
       simultaneously cover an order of magnitude in q in less than a
       minute, allowing the time evolution of a sample to be followed
       (kinetics). TOF-GISANS is also possible.
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), polarised beam
       This is achieved by using an S-bender polarising the TOF beam in a
       selectable wavelength range with high polarisation. Pol TOF-GISANS
       and kinetic studies also possible.
     * Monochromatic, non-polarised
       The non-poarised angle dispersive mode (high flux at 5.5 Å used
       over the entire q-range). Not suitable for kinetic studies as each
       point in q must be measured sequentially. GISANS possible.
     * Monochromatic, polarised beam
       For the study of magnetic samples with a choice of polarisation
       analysis between a supermirror for the specular beam and a 3He cell
       covering the wide solid angle of the multidetector for off-specular
       studies. The instrument is ideal for the measurement of
       off-specular scattering arising from large scale in-plane
       structure, glancing incidence small angle scattering (GISANS) from
       smaller scale in-plane structure.

What is the ILL

Unique facilities and cutting-edge expertise

   The Institut Laue-Langevin is an international research centre at the
   leading edge of neutron science and technology.

   As the world’s flagship centre for neutron science, the ILL provides
   scientists with a very high flux of neutrons feeding some 40
   state-of-the-art instruments, which are constantly being developed and
   upgraded.

   As a service institute the ILL makes its facilities and expertise
   available to visiting scientists. Every year, about 1400 researchers
   from over 40 countries visit the ILL and 640 experiments selected by a
   scientific review committee are performed. Research focuses primarily
   on fundamental science in a variety of fields: condensed matter
   physics, chemistry, biology, nuclear physics and materials science,
   etc.

   Whilst some are working on engine designs, fuels, plastics and
   household products, others are looking at biological processes at
   cellular and molecular level.  Still others may be elucidating the
   physics that could contribute to the electronic devices of the future.
   ILL can specially tailor its neutron beams to probe the fundamental
   processes that help to explain how our universe came into being, why it
   looks the way it does today and how it can sustain life.
   The ILL also collaborates closely and at different levels of
   confidentiality with the R&D departments of industrial enterprises.

   All the scientists at the ILL - chemists, physicists, biologists,
   crystallographers, specialists in magnetism and nuclear physics - are
   also experts in neutron research and technology and their combined
   know-how is made available to the scientific community.

   ILL is funded and managed by France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in
   partnership with 10 other countries.
