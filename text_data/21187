The phisher king: why author James Veitch spent two years replying to every
scammer that emailed him

   Beware scam emails, they say — so why did James Veitch spend two years
   replying to every one that hit his inbox?

   King con: James Veitch reveals his exchanges with scammers in his new

   I’m the author of a book called Dot Con but I’ve really only written
   half of it. The book is the result of two years emailing back and forth
   with online scammers. I’d call it a collaboration — but can it be
   called that if only one party is aware that it is a collaboration?

   In meetings with the publisher, I wondered whether the scammers would
   ever find out that they were published authors. There were several
   discussions and one or two amendments to the contract but, in the end,
   it was felt that, in the event that they did discover the book, they
   would be unlikely to claim royalties.

   Nevertheless, I am indebted to their zeal and enthusiasm for the
   project. I even have a quotation from Solomon Odonkoh on the back of
   the book directly below blurbs from The Sunday Herald and The
   Independent.

   “You are a total disgrace to manhood; go f*ck yourself.”

   It was an email, received first thing in the morning, from my friend
   Alex (subject fielded: unexpected trip, mugging) that sowed the seeds
   of what’s become Dot Con. It didn’t take me long to realise that it
   wasn’t Alex (Western Union, alarm bells) and, I reasoned, this gave me
   the upper hand. I was sitting up in bed now, finger poised over DELETE
   on my iPhone when the question came quite unbidden: “What would happen
   if I replied?”

   The marooned friend is one of the best-known scams, principally because
   it’s the one that dodges the spam filter most often. It comes from
   someone you know but often only tangentially. It’s since become — hands
   down — one of my favourite scams. The scammer is pretending to be
   someone whom you know; they don’t know how you know them, though, which
   means you can just make it up as you go along. I pecked out a reply.

   “Alex, but how on earth did this happen?”

   And the game was afoot.

   The correspondence lasted a day and forms the first chapter of Dot Con.
   In fact, that one reply spawned a book and an Edinburgh Show; I had so
   much fun that it got me thinking: what would happen if I began replying
   to every scam email I received? And that’s what I’ve been doing for the
   past two years ... on your behalf.

   Most scams are absurd. So absurd that one wonders how anyone falls for
   them at all; yet if no one falls for them, how do the scammers make
   money? A computer scientist at Microsoft has something clever to say
   about this. He did a cost-benefit analysis and realised that the
   absurdity of the scams is actually a deliberate and fairly brilliant
   ploy. He wrote: “By sending an email that repels all but the most
   gullible, the scammer gets the most promising ‘marks’ to self-select,
   and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favour.”

   In other words; by making the scenarios preposterous the scammer
   ensures that only the most gullible people reply.

   I’ve been inducted into the FBI, won the Peruvian lottery (twice), been
   buttered up by kings, princes and pirates. I have offshore accounts,
   consignments of gold and a fairly serious girlfriend in Moscow (we’re
   giving it until spring 2017 and then one of us is going to move).

   Do try this at home if you dare; it’s the only defence we have. We need
   to waste as much of their time as they do ours. But best to create a
   pseudonymous email account and use that to reply. Initially I was using
   my own account and, consequently, I think I was put on some sort of
   “list of suckers”. I’d wake up to discover 400 new emails about penis
   enlargements; only one of which was a legitimate response to a casual
   enquiry I’d made.

   Don’t get me wrong — I don’t want to be mean to the scammers. There are
   lots of people online who do that. I’m content merely having fun
   inventing, and I figure any time they’re spending with me is time in
   which they’re not scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings.

   Incidentally, if you think you don’t get spam, you do; you just have a
   very good spam filter. If you want to see what’s been netted pre-inbox,
   open your spam folder — there will be dragons ... but also, I believe,
   opportunities. I think of the spam folder not as Pandora’s box but as a
   costume shop in which you can play and play at being whoever and
   whatever you wish. If only for a time. Last week, I was a bank robber,
   a pilot and the one-time confidante of a beautiful Arabian princess —
   and that was just Monday.

   It’s worth mentioning that for every one of the emails in the book
   there were 10 or 20 that didn’t make the cut. Conversation would end
   abruptly when the scammer rumbled me as a time-waster, or an email
   would bounce, the scammer’s email address having been confiscated and
   destroyed by their provider. More often than not, the scammer would
   refuse to go off-script, giving me just generic, pasted responses. But,
   on rare occasions, with enough coaxing... well, you’ll see.

The phisher king: why author James Veitch spent two years replying to every
scammer that emailed him

   Beware scam emails, they say — so why did James Veitch spend two years
   replying to every one that hit his inbox?

   King con: James Veitch reveals his exchanges with scammers in his new

   I’m the author of a book called Dot Con but I’ve really only written
   half of it. The book is the result of two years emailing back and forth
   with online scammers. I’d call it a collaboration — but can it be
   called that if only one party is aware that it is a collaboration?

   In meetings with the publisher, I wondered whether the scammers would
   ever find out that they were published authors. There were several
   discussions and one or two amendments to the contract but, in the end,
   it was felt that, in the event that they did discover the book, they
   would be unlikely to claim royalties.

   Nevertheless, I am indebted to their zeal and enthusiasm for the
   project. I even have a quotation from Solomon Odonkoh on the back of
   the book directly below blurbs from The Sunday Herald and The
   Independent.

   “You are a total disgrace to manhood; go f*ck yourself.”

   It was an email, received first thing in the morning, from my friend
   Alex (subject fielded: unexpected trip, mugging) that sowed the seeds
   of what’s become Dot Con. It didn’t take me long to realise that it
   wasn’t Alex (Western Union, alarm bells) and, I reasoned, this gave me
   the upper hand. I was sitting up in bed now, finger poised over DELETE
   on my iPhone when the question came quite unbidden: “What would happen
   if I replied?”

   The marooned friend is one of the best-known scams, principally because
   it’s the one that dodges the spam filter most often. It comes from
   someone you know but often only tangentially. It’s since become — hands
   down — one of my favourite scams. The scammer is pretending to be
   someone whom you know; they don’t know how you know them, though, which
   means you can just make it up as you go along. I pecked out a reply.

   “Alex, but how on earth did this happen?”

   And the game was afoot.

   The correspondence lasted a day and forms the first chapter of Dot Con.
   In fact, that one reply spawned a book and an Edinburgh Show; I had so
   much fun that it got me thinking: what would happen if I began replying
   to every scam email I received? And that’s what I’ve been doing for the
   past two years ... on your behalf.

   Most scams are absurd. So absurd that one wonders how anyone falls for
   them at all; yet if no one falls for them, how do the scammers make
   money? A computer scientist at Microsoft has something clever to say
   about this. He did a cost-benefit analysis and realised that the
   absurdity of the scams is actually a deliberate and fairly brilliant
   ploy. He wrote: “By sending an email that repels all but the most
   gullible, the scammer gets the most promising ‘marks’ to self-select,
   and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favour.”

   In other words; by making the scenarios preposterous the scammer
   ensures that only the most gullible people reply.

   I’ve been inducted into the FBI, won the Peruvian lottery (twice), been
   buttered up by kings, princes and pirates. I have offshore accounts,
   consignments of gold and a fairly serious girlfriend in Moscow (we’re
   giving it until spring 2017 and then one of us is going to move).

   Do try this at home if you dare; it’s the only defence we have. We need
   to waste as much of their time as they do ours. But best to create a
   pseudonymous email account and use that to reply. Initially I was using
   my own account and, consequently, I think I was put on some sort of
   “list of suckers”. I’d wake up to discover 400 new emails about penis
   enlargements; only one of which was a legitimate response to a casual
   enquiry I’d made.

   Don’t get me wrong — I don’t want to be mean to the scammers. There are
   lots of people online who do that. I’m content merely having fun
   inventing, and I figure any time they’re spending with me is time in
   which they’re not scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings.

   Incidentally, if you think you don’t get spam, you do; you just have a
   very good spam filter. If you want to see what’s been netted pre-inbox,
   open your spam folder — there will be dragons ... but also, I believe,
   opportunities. I think of the spam folder not as Pandora’s box but as a
   costume shop in which you can play and play at being whoever and
   whatever you wish. If only for a time. Last week, I was a bank robber,
   a pilot and the one-time confidante of a beautiful Arabian princess —
   and that was just Monday.

   It’s worth mentioning that for every one of the emails in the book
   there were 10 or 20 that didn’t make the cut. Conversation would end
   abruptly when the scammer rumbled me as a time-waster, or an email
   would bounce, the scammer’s email address having been confiscated and
   destroyed by their provider. More often than not, the scammer would
   refuse to go off-script, giving me just generic, pasted responses. But,
   on rare occasions, with enough coaxing... well, you’ll see.

The phisher king: why author James Veitch spent two years replying to every
scammer that emailed him

   Beware scam emails, they say — so why did James Veitch spend two years
   replying to every one that hit his inbox?

   King con: James Veitch reveals his exchanges with scammers in his new

   I’m the author of a book called Dot Con but I’ve really only written
   half of it. The book is the result of two years emailing back and forth
   with online scammers. I’d call it a collaboration — but can it be
   called that if only one party is aware that it is a collaboration?

   In meetings with the publisher, I wondered whether the scammers would
   ever find out that they were published authors. There were several
   discussions and one or two amendments to the contract but, in the end,
   it was felt that, in the event that they did discover the book, they
   would be unlikely to claim royalties.

   Nevertheless, I am indebted to their zeal and enthusiasm for the
   project. I even have a quotation from Solomon Odonkoh on the back of
   the book directly below blurbs from The Sunday Herald and The
   Independent.

   “You are a total disgrace to manhood; go f*ck yourself.”

   It was an email, received first thing in the morning, from my friend
   Alex (subject fielded: unexpected trip, mugging) that sowed the seeds
   of what’s become Dot Con. It didn’t take me long to realise that it
   wasn’t Alex (Western Union, alarm bells) and, I reasoned, this gave me
   the upper hand. I was sitting up in bed now, finger poised over DELETE
   on my iPhone when the question came quite unbidden: “What would happen
   if I replied?”

   The marooned friend is one of the best-known scams, principally because
   it’s the one that dodges the spam filter most often. It comes from
   someone you know but often only tangentially. It’s since become — hands
   down — one of my favourite scams. The scammer is pretending to be
   someone whom you know; they don’t know how you know them, though, which
   means you can just make it up as you go along. I pecked out a reply.

   “Alex, but how on earth did this happen?”

   And the game was afoot.

   The correspondence lasted a day and forms the first chapter of Dot Con.
   In fact, that one reply spawned a book and an Edinburgh Show; I had so
   much fun that it got me thinking: what would happen if I began replying
   to every scam email I received? And that’s what I’ve been doing for the
   past two years ... on your behalf.

   Most scams are absurd. So absurd that one wonders how anyone falls for
   them at all; yet if no one falls for them, how do the scammers make
   money? A computer scientist at Microsoft has something clever to say
   about this. He did a cost-benefit analysis and realised that the
   absurdity of the scams is actually a deliberate and fairly brilliant
   ploy. He wrote: “By sending an email that repels all but the most
   gullible, the scammer gets the most promising ‘marks’ to self-select,
   and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favour.”

   In other words; by making the scenarios preposterous the scammer
   ensures that only the most gullible people reply.

   I’ve been inducted into the FBI, won the Peruvian lottery (twice), been
   buttered up by kings, princes and pirates. I have offshore accounts,
   consignments of gold and a fairly serious girlfriend in Moscow (we’re
   giving it until spring 2017 and then one of us is going to move).

   Do try this at home if you dare; it’s the only defence we have. We need
   to waste as much of their time as they do ours. But best to create a
   pseudonymous email account and use that to reply. Initially I was using
   my own account and, consequently, I think I was put on some sort of
   “list of suckers”. I’d wake up to discover 400 new emails about penis
   enlargements; only one of which was a legitimate response to a casual
   enquiry I’d made.

   Don’t get me wrong — I don’t want to be mean to the scammers. There are
   lots of people online who do that. I’m content merely having fun
   inventing, and I figure any time they’re spending with me is time in
   which they’re not scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings.

   Incidentally, if you think you don’t get spam, you do; you just have a
   very good spam filter. If you want to see what’s been netted pre-inbox,
   open your spam folder — there will be dragons ... but also, I believe,
   opportunities. I think of the spam folder not as Pandora’s box but as a
   costume shop in which you can play and play at being whoever and
   whatever you wish. If only for a time. Last week, I was a bank robber,
   a pilot and the one-time confidante of a beautiful Arabian princess —
   and that was just Monday.

   It’s worth mentioning that for every one of the emails in the book
   there were 10 or 20 that didn’t make the cut. Conversation would end
   abruptly when the scammer rumbled me as a time-waster, or an email
   would bounce, the scammer’s email address having been confiscated and
   destroyed by their provider. More often than not, the scammer would
   refuse to go off-script, giving me just generic, pasted responses. But,
   on rare occasions, with enough coaxing... well, you’ll see.

The phisher king: why author James Veitch spent two years replying to every
scammer that emailed him

   Beware scam emails, they say — so why did James Veitch spend two years
   replying to every one that hit his inbox?

   King con: James Veitch reveals his exchanges with scammers in his new

   I’m the author of a book called Dot Con but I’ve really only written
   half of it. The book is the result of two years emailing back and forth
   with online scammers. I’d call it a collaboration — but can it be
   called that if only one party is aware that it is a collaboration?

   In meetings with the publisher, I wondered whether the scammers would
   ever find out that they were published authors. There were several
   discussions and one or two amendments to the contract but, in the end,
   it was felt that, in the event that they did discover the book, they
   would be unlikely to claim royalties.

   Nevertheless, I am indebted to their zeal and enthusiasm for the
   project. I even have a quotation from Solomon Odonkoh on the back of
   the book directly below blurbs from The Sunday Herald and The
   Independent.

   “You are a total disgrace to manhood; go f*ck yourself.”

   It was an email, received first thing in the morning, from my friend
   Alex (subject fielded: unexpected trip, mugging) that sowed the seeds
   of what’s become Dot Con. It didn’t take me long to realise that it
   wasn’t Alex (Western Union, alarm bells) and, I reasoned, this gave me
   the upper hand. I was sitting up in bed now, finger poised over DELETE
   on my iPhone when the question came quite unbidden: “What would happen
   if I replied?”

   The marooned friend is one of the best-known scams, principally because
   it’s the one that dodges the spam filter most often. It comes from
   someone you know but often only tangentially. It’s since become — hands
   down — one of my favourite scams. The scammer is pretending to be
   someone whom you know; they don’t know how you know them, though, which
   means you can just make it up as you go along. I pecked out a reply.

   “Alex, but how on earth did this happen?”

   And the game was afoot.

   The correspondence lasted a day and forms the first chapter of Dot Con.
   In fact, that one reply spawned a book and an Edinburgh Show; I had so
   much fun that it got me thinking: what would happen if I began replying
   to every scam email I received? And that’s what I’ve been doing for the
   past two years ... on your behalf.

   Most scams are absurd. So absurd that one wonders how anyone falls for
   them at all; yet if no one falls for them, how do the scammers make
   money? A computer scientist at Microsoft has something clever to say
   about this. He did a cost-benefit analysis and realised that the
   absurdity of the scams is actually a deliberate and fairly brilliant
   ploy. He wrote: “By sending an email that repels all but the most
   gullible, the scammer gets the most promising ‘marks’ to self-select,
   and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favour.”

   In other words; by making the scenarios preposterous the scammer
   ensures that only the most gullible people reply.

   I’ve been inducted into the FBI, won the Peruvian lottery (twice), been
   buttered up by kings, princes and pirates. I have offshore accounts,
   consignments of gold and a fairly serious girlfriend in Moscow (we’re
   giving it until spring 2017 and then one of us is going to move).

   Do try this at home if you dare; it’s the only defence we have. We need
   to waste as much of their time as they do ours. But best to create a
   pseudonymous email account and use that to reply. Initially I was using
   my own account and, consequently, I think I was put on some sort of
   “list of suckers”. I’d wake up to discover 400 new emails about penis
   enlargements; only one of which was a legitimate response to a casual
   enquiry I’d made.

   Don’t get me wrong — I don’t want to be mean to the scammers. There are
   lots of people online who do that. I’m content merely having fun
   inventing, and I figure any time they’re spending with me is time in
   which they’re not scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings.

   Incidentally, if you think you don’t get spam, you do; you just have a
   very good spam filter. If you want to see what’s been netted pre-inbox,
   open your spam folder — there will be dragons ... but also, I believe,
   opportunities. I think of the spam folder not as Pandora’s box but as a
   costume shop in which you can play and play at being whoever and
   whatever you wish. If only for a time. Last week, I was a bank robber,
   a pilot and the one-time confidante of a beautiful Arabian princess —
   and that was just Monday.

   It’s worth mentioning that for every one of the emails in the book
   there were 10 or 20 that didn’t make the cut. Conversation would end
   abruptly when the scammer rumbled me as a time-waster, or an email
   would bounce, the scammer’s email address having been confiscated and
   destroyed by their provider. More often than not, the scammer would
   refuse to go off-script, giving me just generic, pasted responses. But,
   on rare occasions, with enough coaxing... well, you’ll see.
