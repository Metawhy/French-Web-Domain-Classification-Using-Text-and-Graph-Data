   The ProVal team was stopped at the end of August 2012, and reborn into

Overview

   [USEMAP:themes_en.png] ProVal is a project-team of the INRIA Saclay -
   Île-de-France research center, joint with LRI (CNRS and University of
   Paris Sud), located in Orsay, France.

   The objective of the team is to propose methods and tools that can be
   integrated into the software development cycle and that make it
   possible to produce code that is proven to be correct with respect to
   its expected behavior.

   The team develops a generic program proof environment (the Why
   platform), that is able to generate proof demands that can then be
   delegated to automatic or interactive provers. Dedicated environments
   to prove C programs (Frama-C/Jessie) and Java programs (Krakatoa)
   annotated with formulas describing the expected behavior, are
   constructed on top of this tool.

   scientific activities the team. You can also find recent results
   described in our annual research report for 2011.
