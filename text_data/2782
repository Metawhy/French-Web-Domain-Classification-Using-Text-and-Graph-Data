The Art of Doing

   In our modern times there is a lost art. The art of doing and being.
   Certainly we are busy. So busy we have built a culture on who is the
   busiest. The most activities wins! But what do you win? Exhaustion and
   anxiety. Instead of exhaustion, disconnection and anxiety learn to
   really live life by participating in it fully. Go make something,
   travel somewhere new, or tend your garden. Be in the moment and
   participate fully instead of just running from pointless activity to
   activity. Sign up below and get tips on how to really DO!
