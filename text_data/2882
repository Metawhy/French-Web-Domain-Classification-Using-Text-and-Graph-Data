A Complete Guide to Decoding the Instagram Algorithm in 2019

   Since Instagram introduced the algorithm feed, back in 2006, every
   social media marketer tried to decipher its formula. In the beginning,
   all the Instagram posts would appear in the feed in chronological
   order. This system was quite popular at the time, so much so that the
   launch of the new feed algorithm was cause for a lot of frustration and
   anger amongst users.

What was the reason behind the change?

   According to Instagram, most of the users were missing a lot of their
   friends content and nearly 70% of all the posts published on the
   platform. After the change, despite all the backlash and the confusion
   about the posts order, Instagram states that now users are seeing
   almost 90% of their friends’ posts.

Instagram’s algorithm explained

   So how does it work?
   What’s the infamous feed ranking criteria?

   Many hypotheses and conspiracy theories circulated online about the
   algorithm and how Instagram decides which post to show you first.

   However, recently they decided to shed some light on this issue. They
   basically rely on our past behavior to determine in which order we get
   to see the posts in our feeds. So each user has a unique feed based on
   the posts they like or comment on, the stories they watch, the content
   and profiles they interact with on a daily basis.

   These are the main factors behind Instagram’s feed algorithm:

#1. Interest

   Through its machine learning algorithm, Instagram is trying to figure
   out what type of content you like most. So if you tend to interact with
   a certain type of content by liking, commenting, viewing, saving or
   sharing with your friends, then this type of content is what you will
   see higher in your feed. So the more you engage with a type of posts,
   let’s say fitness posts, the more you will see them first in your feed.

   For businesses: If you want your posts to reach as many people as
   possible, you need to make sure your posts are engaging, your captions
   invite them to comment and share your posts. Ask and answer questions
   in your stories, create polls, engage with your fans.

#2. Recency

   How recently was shared a certain post amongst the one that interests
   you the most, is another factor that Instagram takes into consideration
   when deciding what to show you first.

   For businesses: Use analytics apps or Instagram insights to find out at
   what times your users are using Instagram more and interact with their
   posts. This is when you should post your content. Of course, there will
   a lot of trial and error. We recommend doing A/B testing to find out
   the best times to share your content.

#3. Relationship

   How close you are with the person that shared a certain post is also
   very important. If you tend to interact more with certain people, their
   posts will be prioritized in your feed. Let’s say you are being tagged
   with certain people in photos, you comment on their posts, send them
   messages, follow their stories and so on. All these actions will
   determine how close you are with your friends, and, obviously, you will
   see more of your closest friends’ posts first.

   For businesses: We say this a lot on our blog: engagement is key! To
   make sure you keep your followers close you need to always create
   engaging content, content that entices people to take action. Instagram
   decides your relationship with your followers based on their
   interactions with your posts and account.
   First, you need to analyze your posts and identify the ones that
   generate more interactions amongst your followers.
   Next, analyze your competitors to see their most engaging content.
   And finally: always A/B test your posts. Don’t get comfortable thinking
   you know what your users want. Social media is always evolving, trends
   come and go so fast, you always need to be on top of your social media
   marketing game.

#4. Frequency

   How often you are using Instagram is another important factor in
   deciding your feed, because the algorithm will show you the best posts
   since your last visit.

#5. Following

   This goes without saying, but if you are following a lot of people then
   there will be a lot of competition for the top spots in your feed.
   Instagram will have to choose from a wide range of posts to show you
   first. Instagram doesn’t hide any post, so you will still be able to
   see all the new posts since your last visit, but you’ll have to do a
   lot of scrolling.

#6. Usage

   And finally, how much time you spend on the app will decide how many of
   the new posts you will see in your feed. Like I said before if you
   follow a lot of Instagram accounts, to see all their posts you will
   have to spend some time browsing.

How to make the algorithm work in your favor?

   If you have a business Instagram account, your main goal is to have
   your posts seen by as many followers as possible. Their time on
   Instagram is limited, this means that you’ll have to compete with a lot
   of other business and friends accounts for their attention. You need to
   get your posts as higher as possible in their feeds.

   How do you do that? How can you take advantage of what we learned about
   Instagram’s new feed ranking criteria?

Post consistently and at the right times

   Find out when your followers are using Instagram to know when to post
   your content. The more people are seeing your posts, the more the
   algorithm likes them. Also, make sure you post a lot of content
   regularly so that your followers get to interact with more of your
   content.
   The idea is that the longer someone spends engaging with your content,
   the better your chances are to have your future posts rank higher in
   their feeds.
   Don’t worry, you don’t have to spend a lot of time to posts on a
   regular basis, always at the right times: you can easily schedule your
   posts with JARVEE .

Experiment with stories, IGTV and any other Instagram content format

   Try catching your followers’ attention wherever they are: experiment
   with stories, do live videos, long format IGTVs and so on. The longer
   you keep your followers engaged, watching, commenting, responding to
   your questions, the more of your content they will see.
   With stories especially you can have your fans vote, ask you questions,
   share, answer your questions, that’s a lot of interactions. You need to
   encourage this kind of dynamics around all your content. This way your
   content will be more credible in the eyes of the algorithm.

Engagement is king!

   Put in the work and engage with your followers and you will see big
   rewards. If you like their posts, comment, tag them, save their best
   content, share your most loyal fans, they will feel an important part
   of your brand and they will drive even more views and engagement to
   your profile.
   All these actions can be made on autopilot as well, with JARVEE saving
   you a lot of time – and I can’t stress that enough, you’ll be amazed
   how much free time you’ll have on your hands. But I still recommend
   some true and sincere connections with your fans from time to time.

       It does take time to understand the algorithm and how it actually
       works. Many people were disappointed when they face the algorithm.
       But the main objective of current algorithm was to bring more
       quality content and let people spend more time on app by doing all
       type of organic activity to gain their Instagram followers
