Style Guide for writing about the Richmond SPCA

     * “Richmond SPCA” should be used on all references unless the
       publication you are writing for requires “Richmond Society for the
       Prevention of Cruelty to Animals” on first reference.

     * Although the AP Stylebook correctly notes that the ASPCA is limited
       to the five boroughs of New York City, it is inaccurate in
       referring to other humane societies with SPCA in their names as
       “autonomous chapters.” The Richmond SPCA is an independent, local
       non-profit and not a chapter or affiliate of any other
       organization.

     * The abbreviation RSPCA is used exclusively by the Royal SPCA in the
       United Kingdom and is not used to refer to the Richmond SPCA.

     * Our facility that houses our animal shelter, adoption center, track
       and training center, gift shop and administrative offices is called
       the Robins-Starr Humane Center, named for E. Claiborne Robins Jr.
       and Robin Robertson Starr.

     * Our full-service, low-cost hospital, the Susan M. Markel Veterinary
       Hospital, is named in memory of Susan, the late wife of Tony
       Markel.
