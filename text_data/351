     * Experience
     * Jimmy Bradley

     * In 1999, a journeyman chef named Jimmy Bradley opened The Red Cat
       in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood. With a down-to-earth setting,
       The Red Cat eschewed the very notion of “concept,” offering
       outstanding food and professional, attitude-free service. To this
       day, The Red Cat remains defined by this simple approach. Bradley
       and his staff focus on the little things, believing that details
       are the difference between good and great. The Red Cat is an
       extension of Bradley's legendary commitment to hospitality, and his
       philosophy is simple:
       “No matter where I’ve lived, worked or traveled, there’s always
       been a special restaurant, a can-do joint that’s all things to all
       people,” says Bradley. “They’re gathering places where you can drop
       in for a drink or a meal at the bar, or sit down in a dining room
       where you can gather with friends to end the day or start the
       evening. As long as there's good food and good people, good times
       are sure to follow.”
     * Jimmy Bradley
       As author and chef/owner of popular New York City restaurant The
       Red Cat, Jimmy Bradley presides over a neighborhood joint that has
       become a destination for guests from around the city, and the
       country. A purveyor of straightforward, occasionally irreverent
       food and contagious conviviality, all of it wrapped up in an
       attitude-free package, Jimmy has helped contemporary diners
       rediscover the intrinsic value of classic Mediterranean cuisine,
       reinterpreted for a modern American clientele. Bradley has been
       featured in New York magazine, Food & Wine, Bon Appetit, and The
       New York Times, and on television programs such as The TODAY Show,
       Bravo’s Top Chef Masters and the CBS Early Show. His first
       cookbook, The Red Cat Cookbook, was published by Clarkson Potter in
       2006.
