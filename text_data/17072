QUIÉNES SOMOS

¿QUÉ ES M·A·C?

   M·A·C es la autoridad mundial en maquillaje profesional gracias a su
   experiencia sin igual en el ARTE de maquillar.

   M·A·C celebra la diversidad y la INDIVIDUALIDAD – estamos aquí para
   todas las edades, todas las razas y todos los géneros.

   M·A·C es una COMUNIDAD orgullosa de artistas maquilladores
   profesionales que trabajan juntos para dar vida a nuestra visión.

   M·A·C está a la vanguardia de los CREADORES DE TENDENCIAS en moda, y
   trabaja en conjunto con talentos líderes de la moda, el arte y la
   cultura popular.
   Nuestros Artistas crean tendencias detrás de escena, en semanas de la
   moda de todo el mundo.

   M·A·C cree en la RESPONSABILIDAD SOCIAL, e iniciativas como VIVA GLAM y
   el M·A·C AIDS Fund son el alma de nuestra cultura única.

EL NACIMIENTO DE UN CULTO:
CÓMO SE EXTENDIÓ LA BELLEZA

   Todas las Edades, Todas las Razas, Todos los Géneros... Una marca de
   maquillaje profesional que marca tendencia detrás de escena en semanas
   de la moda de todo el mundo. Hoy M·A·C significa tanto para sus
   millones de fanáticos en cada rincón del planeta, pero un fenómeno de
   belleza global tiene que haber empezado en algún lado.

   Make-Up Art Cosmetics nació en Toronto, Canadá. El artista maquillador
   y fotógrafo Frank Toskan y Frank Angelo, dueño de un salón de belleza,
   se sentían frustrados por la falta de maquillaje que permitiera lograr
   buenas fotografías, así que decidieron crear uno propio. Al principio
   fabricaban los cosméticos en su cocina y los vendían directamente en el
   salón de belleza a otros artistas maquilladores, así como a modelos y
   fotógrafos. Pronto los estilistas y editores de modas se sumaron a la
   acción. A medida que aparecían más menciones en revistas y la
   popularidad boca a boca crecía, el dúo lanzó M·A·C en marzo de 1984, en
   el mostrador de una tienda por departamentos de Toronto.

   Su enfoque era ofrecer una herramienta elegante, con el maquillaje
   contenido en tarros negros en lugar de estuches compactos. Mientras que
   otras importantes marcas de maquillaje de la época eran
   predominantemente compañías del cuidado de la piel, M·A·C eligió
   establecerse como la autoridad absoluta en color. Makeup artists
   profesionales atendían el counter, siendo la primera vez que esto se
   hacía en la industria. Una de las ofertas más populares fue un lipstick
   rojo mate intenso, el cual obtuvo un fuerte despegue con su aparición
   en una sesión fotográfica de Madonna, a quien más tarde veríamos
   portando un camiseta M·A·C.

   La empresa irrumpió en la industria con una amplia variedad de
   productos que fusionaban experiencia de todos los días con un estilo
   glamoroso. Detrás del mostrador, el enfoque de M·A·C era muy diferente.
   En lugar de alentar la venta con técnicas tradicionales de promoción,
   M·A·C se apoyaba en la integridad de su línea de productos
   cuidadosamente formulada. También aportaban un toque de extravagancia a
   la imagen. Como una compañía que honra la individualidad y la expresión
   personal por encima del resto, aportó un maravilloso sentido teatral,
   con reminiscencia de drag queens a las elegantes tiendas M·A·C y
   mostradores de tiendas departamentales.

   En 1994, con el VIH y el SIDA que se extendían en el mundo, M·A·C
   aportó fondos de caridad a organizaciones de prevención de VIH/SIDA, y
   se creó la M·A·C AIDS Fund. A la fecha, la campaña VIVA GLAM ha
   recaudado más de $400 millones para la lucha contra el VIH/SIDA, con
   voceras como Lady Gaga, Pamela Anderson y Nicki Minaj.

   Parte de Estée Lauder Companies desde 1994, M·A·C se vende hoy en más
   de 90 países alrededor del mundo. Sigue comprometida a desarrollar
   nuevas categorías, productos y más de 50 colecciones al año, las cuales
   continúan satisfaciendo las demandas de los consumidores y de los
   makeup artists profesionales por igual.

   Su trabajo en conjunto con nombres amados de la cultura popular, el
   arte y la moda incluye nombres como Rihanna, Lorde, Proenza Schouler,
   The Rocky Horror Picture Show y Brooke Shields. Ellos destacan aun más
   la importancia de M·A·C y llegan a los fanáticos actuales, así como a
   nuevos fanáticos, mientras que la presencia constante de nuestros
   Artistas Maquilladores detrás de escena en más de 200 desfiles de
   semanas de la moda alrededor del mundo, con nombres como Prabal Gurung
   o Vivienne Westwood, garantiza a M·A·C el envidiado reconocimiento como
   la empresa de belleza del mundo más importante en generación de
   tendencias.

VIVA GLAM
Y LA FUNDACIÓN M·A·C AIDS Fund

   “Soy la chica M·A·C” Este provocativo slogan anuncia el primer rostro
   de VIVA GLAM. Un ícono drag, RuPaul, resplandeciente con botas de cuero
   y corset rojo. Nacía una campaña legendaria, una en la que podíamos ver
   diferentes estrellas y estilos con el paso de los años, pero
   manteniendo siempre ese espíritu de irreverencia, provocación e
   irrepresible amor por la vida.

   Creado en 1994, el apasionado VIVA GLAM Lipstick rojo recaudó dinero y
   creó conciencia sobre el VIH/SIDA cuando la pandemia estaba afectando
   dramáticamente las comunidades de la moda en particular así como todo
   el mundo. En aquel entonces y en la actualidad, el 100% del precio de
   la compra de cualquier producto VIVA GLAM se dona al M·A·C AIDS Fund
   (menos el impuesto, cuando corresponde), algo que no tiene precedentes.

   En las dos décadas que han pasado desde la aparición de RuPaul, la
   galaxia de estrellas que han protagonizado la campaña no tiene
   comparación, incluyendo Lady Gaga, Elton John, Debbie Harry, Boy
   George, Cyndi Lauper, Nicki Minaj, Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera,
   Dita Von Teese, Shirley Manson, Mary J Blige, Rihanna y la más
   reciente, Miley Cyrus. Ariana grande, Taraji P. Henson, y la más
   reciente, Sia.

   El M·A·C AIDS Fund es pionero en donar fondos para el VIH/SIDA,
   otorgando apoyo financiero a organizaciones que trabajan en regiones y
   poblaciones desatendidas. Como la compañía donante no farmacéutica más
   grande en la materia, el M·A·C AIDS Fund está comprometido a tratar el
   vínculo que existe entre la pobreza y el VIH/SIDA apoyando a diversas
   organizaciones alrededor del mundo que proveen una amplia gama de
   servicios a personas que viven con esta enfermedad. Hasta la fecha, el
   M·A·C AIDS Fund ha recaudado más de USD$400 millones exclusivamente a
   través de la venta del Lipstick y Lipglass VIVA GLAM de M·A·C donando
   el 100 por ciento del precio de venta para la lucha contra el VIH/SIDA.

   Larga vida a VIVA GLAM! Todos somos la chica M·A·C!

   You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions constitute

   event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be
   unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by any
   applicable arbitral award or court decision, such unenforceability or
   invalidity shall not render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or
   invalid as a whole, but these Terms and Conditions shall be modified,
   to the extent possible, by the adjudicating entity to most fully
   reflect the original intent of the parties as reflected in the original
   provision. The headings in the Terms and Conditions are for convenience
   only and shall not be used in its interpretation.

   detail below, we may also collect information about your usage and

      COOKIES, WEB SERVER LOGS AND WEB BEACONS

   Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or
   other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to
   store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell
   you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and
   how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that
   without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of the
   Site.

   In conjunction with obtaining information through cookies, our web
   servers may log details such as your operating system type, browser
   type, domain and other system settings, as well as the language your

   located. The web server logs also may record information such as the
   address of the web page that linked you to our site and the IP address
   of the device you use to connect to the Internet.

   To control which web servers collect this information, we may place
   tags on our web pages called “web beacons.” These are computer
   instructions that link web pages to particular web servers and their
   cookies.

      THIRD PARTY WEB ANALYTICS SERVICES

   We may use third party web analytics services on this site, our social
   network pages, or our mobile applications, such as those of Adobe Site
   Catalyst and/or Google Analytics. The service providers that administer
   these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and
   web beacons to help us analyze how visitors use the site. The
   information collected through these means (including IP address) is
   disclosed to these service providers, who use the information to
   evaluate use of the website. You may deactivate the ability of these
   analytics services to analyze your browsing activities on this site. To

   IP addresses and other information through the use of cookies, web
   server logs and web beacons on our websites and emails; on third-party
   websites and emails; and on our advertising placed on third-party

   We may share your personal information with:
     * Our affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
       “Affiliate” means a person or entity that, directly or indirectly
       and through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled
       by, or is under common control with, our company, which distributes

       Companies”). If you prefer that we do not share your personal
       information with our affiliates, please do not provide your
       personal information to us. We cannot offer the benefits of M∙A∙C
       Cosmetics Uruguay to those who do not consent to share their

       affiliates, please visit
     * Third parties who perform services on our behalf based on our
       instructions. We do not authorize these service providers to use or
       disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on
       our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Examples of these
       service providers include data analysis companies, customer service
       specialists, email providers, web hosting companies, and mail
       houses.

   In addition, we and our affiliates and other service providers may
   disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law
   or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other
   government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary
   or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in

   illegal activity.

      BUSINESS TRANSFERS

   We also may transfer personal information we have about you in the
   event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
   Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to
   direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to
   us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy. Following
   such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we
   transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the
   processing of that information. You can request that your personal
   information not be transferred as a business asset by contacting us as
   indicated in the “YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES” section below.

      TRANSFER OF DATA TO OTHER COUNTRIES

   We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to our
   affiliates and third party service providers to countries other than
   the country in which the information was originally collected,
   including the United States and other countries, where necessary to
   fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, and your personal
   information may be processed and stored outside of Uruguay. Those
   countries may not have the same data protection laws as Uruguay and
   your personal information will be subject to applicable foreign laws.
   When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect
   that information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. We
   have also implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure such a level of
   data protection when transferring your personal data, including the
   conclusion of data transfer agreements or other applicable data
   transfer mechanisms. All third parties that receive your personal
   information are required to comply with this Privacy Policy. If you
   provide personal information to the Site and subsequently decide to
   withdraw your consent to the transfer of your personal information as
   described in this section, please contact us as specified in the “YOUR
   RIGHTS AND CHOICES” section of this Privacy Policy.

   There may be specific rules applicable to these promotions that explain
   how the personal information you provide will be processed. We
   recommend that you review all applicable regulations before
   participating. To the extent that any special event, questionnaire or
   survey is not subject to specific rules, the processing of personal
   information is governed by this Privacy Policy and the purposes stated.
