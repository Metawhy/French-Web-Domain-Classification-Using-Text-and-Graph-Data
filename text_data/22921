Hull University Business School

   You'll find a range of research expertise and business education
   options at this internationally accredited institution. Hull University
   Business School is part of Faculty of Business, Law and Politics.

   We are a leading UK business school with internationally recognised
   accreditations from the Association of MBAs (AMBA) and the Association
   to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). We're dedicated to
   the development of responsible leadership for a complex world. Our aim
   is to inspire those who study and work with us to make a sustainable
   difference in business and society.

   We equip managers and business professionals to succeed in a
   fast-changing and interconnected world. We maximise the connections
   between excellent research, learning and teaching across disciplines.
   And we emphasise our corporate engagement by working with partners who
   share our aspirations and values.

   Our independent accreditations (including the AACSB – held by fewer
   than 5% of the world’s 13,000 business programmes) place us in a select
   group of UK business schools. So our students can be confident about
   our commitment to providing an outstanding experience. And they can
   rely on the enduring value of a Hull University Business School degree
   in the global employment market.
