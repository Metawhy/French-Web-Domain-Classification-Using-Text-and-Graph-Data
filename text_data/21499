   For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” and

   into the hands of the living God.

   Today's passage is from the New International Version. Read by Max
   McLean. Provided by The Listener's Audio Bible.

   ministry that you use to mask your unpleasant emotions and ignore the
   desires deep inside of you? ➤ View this post
