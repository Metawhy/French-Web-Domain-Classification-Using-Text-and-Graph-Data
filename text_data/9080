       Splits ARE hard But they also feel oh so good when done right
       Working towards hanumanasana is a journey much like preparing to
       handstand and it s important that you not only take your time in
       working towards them but that you prepare correctly to prevent
       injuries I m a fan of incorporating splits into my practice for a
       stretch and I came up with a 12 minute flow that really hits all
       the spots needed to work towards the splits So if you re looking
       for some guidance to achieve this goal or if you re looking to gain
       some flexibility head to my YouTube channel for my flow Who s
       working towards Monkey Pose Say Tag a yogi who would benefit from
       this flow yogateacher instayoga yogaclass
