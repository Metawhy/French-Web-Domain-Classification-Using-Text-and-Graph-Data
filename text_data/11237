   President Paul Kagame yesterday attended the first session of the G7
   Summit in Biarritz, France.

   Rwanda—alongside Australia, Burkina Faso, Chile, Egypt, India, Senegal,
   and South Africa—is taking part in the summit as part of the eight
   non-member states.

   President Kagame participated in the G7 and Africa partnership meeting
   on Sunday afternoon.

   The session discussed security in the Sahel region and also looked into
   the key achievements of the G7 and Africa partnership with a special
   focus on women entrepreneurship, digital transformation, and the fight
   against corruption.

   G7, also known as the Group of Seven, is made up of seven countries –
   which are among the largest economies of the world.

   The summit brings together leaders and policymakers from the most
   advanced economies including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
   United Kingdom, and the United States to build consensus look into
   challenging global issues.

   The countries are estimated to represent about 62 percent of the global
   net wealth.

   Founded in the 1970s, the group meets annually to discuss multiple
   global issues including the environment, security, and economy, among
   others.

   As is the custom, the host country invites a select few non-G7 world
   leaders.

   Rwanda was invited as the former chair of the African Union, Egypt as
   the current chair of the Union and South Africa as the incoming chair.
   The three countries form what is called the “Troika” of the African
   Union.

   Senegal was invited as the current leader of the New Partnership for
   African Development (NEPAD) and Burkina Faso as the chair of G5 Sahel.

   Other subjects that will feature prominently at the summit include
   digital transformation and climate change.

EDITORIAL: An ignorant tweet from Biarritz is a wakeup call to African media

   An American White House correspondent for the Associated Press has
   ruffled quite a few feathers of those who felt they had been insulted.

   During the just ended G7 Summit in Biarritz, France, the journalist
   captioned a photo with the words: “World leader bear hug before the
   group photo @ #G7Summit in Biarritz, France. @EmmanuelMacron,
   @narendramodi, @JustinTrudeau and one unidentified leader.”

   The unidentified leader was no other than South African President Cyril
   Ramaphosa. The internet immediately caught fire, many angry that the
   journalist had treated Ramaphosa with disdain and had not even bothered
   to find out the identity of the “black” president.

   Incidentally, from the photo on the journalist’s Twitter handle, she is
   a person of colour so the issue of “racism” should not even arise. The
   onslaught of missiles the lady received should be a lesson enough for
   she had publicly displayed her ignorance and dragged her face in the
   mud.

   The incident was yet another indication that for the so-called
   mainstream media, anything African is not worth research, it is enough
   to simply scratch the surface, unless of course, they are busy killing
   each other.

   It will be interesting to see whether the Tokyo International
   Conference of African Development (TICAD) that opens tomorrow in
   Yokohama, Japan, will get even half the coverage that the G7, a group
   of seven countries and a few invited guests, got.

   We have always been over repeating “Africans telling Africa’s story”,
   but that has just remained empty words. Maybe this is the right time to
   defy the big western media houses by flooding our media with what is
   happening in Yokohama where nearly the whole continent will be
   represented.

   Then, maybe then, will we be telling our story and not waiting for some
   ignorant disconnected journalist to distort it.

   An American White House correspondent for the Associated Press has
   ruffled quite a few feathers of those who felt they had been insulted.

   During the just ended G7 Summit in Biarritz, France, the journalist
   captioned a photo with the words: “World leader bear hug before the
   group photo @ #G7Summit in Biarritz, France. @EmmanuelMacron,
   @narendramodi, @JustinTrudeau and one unidentified leader.”

   The unidentified leader was no other than South African President Cyril
   Ramaphosa. The internet immediately caught fire, many angry that the
   journalist had treated Ramaphosa with disdain and had not even bothered
   to find out the identity of the “black” president.

   Incidentally, from the photo on the journalist’s Twitter handle, she is
   a person of colour so the issue of “racism” should not even arise. The
   onslaught of missiles the lady received should be a lesson enough for
   she had publicly displayed her ignorance and dragged her face in the
   mud.

   The incident was yet another indication that for the so-called
   mainstream media, anything African is not worth research, it is enough
   to simply scratch the surface, unless of course, they are busy killing
   each other.

   It will be interesting to see whether the Tokyo International
   Conference of African Development (TICAD) that opens tomorrow in
   Yokohama, Japan, will get even half the coverage that the G7, a group
   of seven countries and a few invited guests, got.

   We have always been over repeating “Africans telling Africa’s story”,
   but that has just remained empty words. Maybe this is the right time to
   defy the big western media houses by flooding our media with what is
   happening in Yokohama where nearly the whole continent will be
   represented.

   Then, maybe then, will we be telling our story and not waiting for some
   ignorant disconnected journalist to distort it.
