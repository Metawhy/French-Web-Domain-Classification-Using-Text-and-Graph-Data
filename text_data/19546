Essie With the Band Swatch

   Hiya Dolls
    I picked up Essie With the Band the other day and I feel like it's an
   unusual color for me to purchase.  I don't normally wear reds but this
   one caught my eye for Fall.
   With the Band is from the Fall 2015 collection.

New! Heroine Beach Babes Collection

   PR SAMPLES
   Hiya Dolls!
   I have the fun new Heroine Beach Babes Collection called to share with
   you today.  There are 4 new fun and bright cream polishes in this
   collection.  All the formulas are easy to work with, they're a bit on
   the thick side but in a good way!  Each swatch is 2 coats.
   First up is Bubblegum, you guessed it, a sweet bubblegum pink cream.  I
   love how bright yet soft Bubblegum is.
   Son of a Beach is a beautiful aqua green cream.  I'm putting this on my
   toes ASAP.
   Heat Wave is a hot hot hot red coral cream!  Such a beautiful shade.
   In a Haze is a lovely, soft lilac purple.
   What do you guys think of the Beach Babes quad collection?  Heat Wave
   is my fave which is unusual for me as I don't normally gravitate to
   reds but this one is just so beautiful!
   You can purchase Heroine polishes on their website here.  They retail
   for $10.00 USD each.
   Have a great day loves!

Essie With the Band Swatch

   Hiya Dolls
    I picked up Essie With the Band the other day and I feel like it's an
   unusual color for me to purchase.  I don't normally wear reds but this
   one caught my eye for Fall.
   With the Band is from the Fall 2015 collection.

New! Heroine Beach Babes Collection

   PR SAMPLES
   Hiya Dolls!
   I have the fun new Heroine Beach Babes Collection called to share with
   you today.  There are 4 new fun and bright cream polishes in this
   collection.  All the formulas are easy to work with, they're a bit on
   the thick side but in a good way!  Each swatch is 2 coats.
   First up is Bubblegum, you guessed it, a sweet bubblegum pink cream.  I
   love how bright yet soft Bubblegum is.
   Son of a Beach is a beautiful aqua green cream.  I'm putting this on my
   toes ASAP.
   Heat Wave is a hot hot hot red coral cream!  Such a beautiful shade.
   In a Haze is a lovely, soft lilac purple.
   What do you guys think of the Beach Babes quad collection?  Heat Wave
   is my fave which is unusual for me as I don't normally gravitate to
   reds but this one is just so beautiful!
   You can purchase Heroine polishes on their website here.  They retail
   for $10.00 USD each.
   Have a great day loves!

New! Heroine Beach Babes Collection

   PR SAMPLES
   Hiya Dolls!
   I have the fun new Heroine Beach Babes Collection called to share with
   you today.  There are 4 new fun and bright cream polishes in this
   collection.  All the formulas are easy to work with, they're a bit on
   the thick side but in a good way!  Each swatch is 2 coats.
   First up is Bubblegum, you guessed it, a sweet bubblegum pink cream.  I
   love how bright yet soft Bubblegum is.
   Son of a Beach is a beautiful aqua green cream.  I'm putting this on my
   toes ASAP.
   Heat Wave is a hot hot hot red coral cream!  Such a beautiful shade.
   In a Haze is a lovely, soft lilac purple.
   What do you guys think of the Beach Babes quad collection?  Heat Wave
   is my fave which is unusual for me as I don't normally gravitate to
   reds but this one is just so beautiful!
   You can purchase Heroine polishes on their website here.  They retail
   for $10.00 USD each.
   Have a great day loves!
