About the ACTOR Project

   ANALYSIS, CREATION, and TEACHING of ORCHESTRATION

   The ACTOR project involves an interdisciplinary team of composers,
   music theorists, musicologists, computer scientists, psychologists,
   signal processing scientists, sound recordists, and conductors who will
   engage in the analysis, creation and teaching of orchestration in
   contemporary classical, popular, film and video game music. As the
   project progresses, results and tools for creation and teaching will
   become available on this website. So stay tuned!
