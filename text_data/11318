   Join us for a fascinating trip back in time. Learn about American clock
   & watchmaking with particular emphasis on Connecticut, once the clock
   capital of the United States.  The museum holds one of the largest
   displays of American clocks and watches in the world, over 5,500! As
   visitors travel through the museumâ€™s eight galleries, these timekeeping
   devices chime and strike upon the hour.  Located in the historic
   Federal Hill district of Bristol, a portion of the museum is housed in
   an 1801 Federal-style home with a sundial garden.

   We'd love to have you join our team! Come to our special meeting on
   October 16th at 5:30 to find out about the volunteer opportunities that
   we have available. We'll have refreshments, informal tours, and people
   on hand to talk to you about your interest in volunteering. Hope to see
   you there!
