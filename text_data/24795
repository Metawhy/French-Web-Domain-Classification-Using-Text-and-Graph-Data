Welcome to RTALabel.org

   The "Restricted To Adults" website label was created by the Association
   of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP) to better enable parental
   filtering, and to demonstrate the online adult industry's commitment to
   helping parents prevent children from viewing age-inappropriate
   content.

   The RTA Label is free to use, voluntary, and universally available to
   any website that wishes to clearly and effectively label itself as
   being inappropriate for viewing by minors.

   The RTA Verified service will allow you to verify that you have labeled
   your site(s) correctly. With this service you will be issued a special
   button and link to a verification page to let all your visitors know
   that not only are your site(s) labeled but they have also been verified
   by RTA (Restricted to Adults). Please make sure you have already
   labeled your site(s) before using the RTA Verified service.
