about

   The Analog Music Project is a musical act, that focus on building a
   coherent sound stage, using analog musicians, instruments and
   techniques.
   Its second album, "Shinobi III - The Return of the Ninja Master"
   features six compositions extracted from the homonymous video game,
   originally released for the Sega Mega Drive console in 1993. (Also
   known as the Sega Genesis).
   Composed by Hirofumi Murasaki, Morihiko Akiyama and Masayuki Nagao, the
   "Shinobi III" soundtrack, sets itself apart from other video game
   soundtracks, through its melodic quality and distinct Japanese
   character.
   While the "Shinobi III" soundtrack sounded great when played
   mechanically by the Sega Mega Drive Yamaha sound chip, in the AMP's
   album, it is played strictly by humans in new arrangements, more
   focused on groove, live band vibe and in true spirit of the project,
   analog sound.
   The result, is classic video game music, in modern human form.

       Digging In The Carts reveals that while Chip Tanaka was using the
       hyper-nostalgic bleeps and technological restrictions of the era to
       riff on dub and reggae, composers like Yuzo Koshiro and Soshi Hosoi
       were drawing from Detroit techno and minimalist composition too.
       They were all dreaming up their own micro-masterpieces, works that
       stand up well beyond the boundaries of “music for video games.”

       Diggin' In The Carts
       by Various Artists
       supported by 9 fans who also own “Shinobi III - Return of the Ninja
       Master (Original Score)”
       Digging In The Carts reveals that while Chip Tanaka was using the
       hyper-nostalgic bleeps and technological restrictions of the era to
       riff on dub and reggae, composers like Yuzo Koshiro and Soshi Hosoi
       were drawing from Detroit techno and minimalist composition too.
       They were all dreaming up their own micro-masterpieces, works that
       stand up well beyond the boundaries of “music for video games.”
