   Rent a car in Barcelona with Europcar
   Barcelona hardly needs an introduction. The vibrant capital of
   Catalonia, with its long, sandy beach, winding Gothic streets, and
   buzzing bars and restaurants of Las Ramblas, has gained a well-deserved
   reputation ...Read more for enjoyable city breaks. Whether it’s a
   romantic getaway, a weekend away with friends or a family holiday,
   Barcelona truly has something for everyone.
   If you want to explore more of what Spain has to offer, head north to
   the Costa Brava, or stay more local and explore the mountains behind
   the city. Ideally situated just a short distance from the French border
   and with regular car ferries to Ibiza and Majorca, hire a car from
   Europcar Barcelona and easily explore this unique city and its
   beautiful surroundings.

   The Europcar car rental experience in Barcelona
   There really is no shortage of options when it comes to car hire in
   Barcelona. With 14 branches in and around the city, including two at
   the Barcelona El Prat Airport and another at the central train station,
   you are sure to find a location that suits your needs.
   If you are looking for something small for travelling to and from the
   beach, popular choices are the Fiat 500 or Nissan Micra. If you are
   travelling with a larger group or just need a bit more space then check
   out the Volkswagen Touran or Seat Alhambra.
   Europcar Barcelona also offers a comprehensive selection of vans for
   hire. From the compact Peugeot Partner 3M3 to the Iveco Daily 10M3 you
   are sure to find what you are looking for.
   Europcar Barcelona is completely flexible, allowing you to rent for
   days, weeks or even months at a time.

   Driving in Barcelona
   In the city the speed limit is 50 km/h, while country roads are 90 km/h
   and motorways 120 km/h.
   Street parking in Barcelona is not recommended as it is highly
   regulated and you can risk having your car towed away. There are a
   number of multi-storey car parks available however, with prices
   starting at €2.80 per hour. Hotels often make their onsite car parks
   available to non-guests, generally at a cost of around €15 per day.

   Discover Barcelona and the surrounding area by car
   Tourism is the main industry here and with good reason. From the long
   sandy beach of Barceloneta, to the Sagrada Família cathedral, and eight
   World Heritage Sites, the city has no shortage of history, culture and
   entertainment. With a proud culinary tradition, you can sample local
   specialities such as fresh fish, iberico ham, manchego cheese and fat
   juicy olives, all of which can be picked up at any one of the local
   covered markets or sampled in the buzzing tapas bars of the Gothic
   quarter.
   Surrounded by mountains and miles of unspoilt coastline, Barcelona is
   ideally situated for getting a taste of all that Catalonia has to
   offer. Head out into the countryside for the day, or travel onwards to
   the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca, or hug the coastline and venture
   south to Valencia, just 350 kilometres away.
   One of the most iconic attractions in Barcelona, Parc Güell is located
   on the northern edge of the city. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the
   park designed by Antoni Gaudi is a first-class example of Barcelona
   modernism, with spectacular views over the city and the coastline. Full
   of ornate and mystical iconography, long stretches of mosaics and
   bright, colourful statues and sculptures, Parc Güell is not to be
   missed. Drive up to the park early with your Barcelona hire car and
   avoid the crowds.
   Port Aventura, the largest amusement park in Spain, lies just 110
   kilometres south of Barcelona. Boasting 42 rides and rollercoasters,
   two on-site water parks and the newly opened Ferrari Land, there is
   plenty to keep the whole family entertained. There is ample on-site
   parking for €12 per day. And with the seaside towns of Salou and
   Tarragona close by, you can make the most of your trip with a hire car
   from Europcar.

   Things to do in Barcelona
   Home to the Picasso Museum, an impressive contemporary art museum
   (MACBA) whose forecourt is a skateboarding mecca, and the Joan Miró
   Foundation in the foothills of Montjuic, culture in Barcelona is second
   to none. Hop from museum to museum, enjoying local food such as
   anchovies, chickpeas and ‘bombas’ in between. If you really want to get
   a taste of life among the locals, drive out to the Camp Nou stadium and
   catch a Barca match for an atmosphere like no other.

   Rent a car in Lisbon with Europcar
   With sweeping plazas, vintage tramways travelling along cobbled
   streets, multi-coloured boutiques, and trendy bars, Lisbon has
   undeniable charm. The seven hills overlooking the city all give great
   views of the capital ...Read more and the surrounding countryside.
   Hiring a car in Portugal gives the opportunity to explore further
   afield from Lisbon, and there is certainly plenty to see nearby. On the
   south coast of Portugal is Cascais (30 km away); and the lush greenery
   of Sintra-Cascais Natural Park is also not too far away.

   The Europcar car rental experience in Lisbon
   Choose from a number of Europcar stations to collect your car hire in
   Lisbon. There is a branch at Lisbon Airport, several city centre
   points, and a 24-hour downtown service. Wherever is most convenient for
   you, you will find a Europcar station to get your Portugal adventure
   started.
   If you are looking for something small to drive around the city, the
   Renault Clio 5P and Renault Twingo 3D are reliable options for economy
   car hire. Larger groups and families can choose the Renault Megane or
   Audi A3 to travel in comfort and style.
   Moving heavier loads? Europcar Lisbon also offers a fleet of van hire,
   with small and large models. Renting with Europcar means ultimate
   flexibility for your travels, with both car hire and van hire in Lisbon
   available on a short or long term basis.

   Driving in Lisbon
   In addition to a valid driver’s licence from your country of residence,
   it is a good idea to have your photo ID or passport with you at all
   times when driving through Portugal.
   In urban areas and towns the speed limit is usually 50 km/h, but can
   vary as indicated by signposts. On rural roads it is 90 km/h and on
   motorways 120 km/h. Speed limits around residential areas and schools
   are usually 40 km/h.
   On-street parking in the city centre is difficult due to the narrow and
   steep streets. If you need to park in the centre, it is advisable to
   use one of the underground car parks. Paid parking hours are: Monday to
   Friday, between 8am and 8pm; and on Saturdays from 8am to 6pm. There is
   cheaper parking available in car parks south of the city centre,
   charging €5-6 per day.
   There are several toll roads in Portugal with charges payable by cash,
   credit/debit cards or via an electronic system. There are different
   types of electronic tolls: Easy Toll, Toll Card, Toll Service and Via
   Verde Visitors. Easy Toll is connected to your credit card and
   automatically charges when you travel through tolls; Toll Card and Toll
   Service use a pre-paid voucher system, while Via Verde is a wireless
   device you attach to your car.

   Discover Lisbon and the surrounding area by car
   While you are in Lisbon, be sure to head over to Almada across the bay,
   where the Cristo Rei is located. Climb to the top of this sacred
   Catholic monument for exceptional views over the city. Just a 20 minute
   drive via the IP7 bridge road, which crosses the Tagus River, it is a
   stunning journey in itself.
   Lisbon’s location means you can really maximise your time in Portugal,
   exploring the nearby coastline and surrounding area. You should
   definitely visit the expansive Sintra-Cascais Natural Park and with
   Europcar car hire, it couldn’t be easier to travel there. Pena Palace
   (32 kilometres away), Cresmina Dune, Praia do Guincho and the Palace of
   Sintra, are just some of the magical attractions you can find nearby.
   The National Palace of Queluz, 13 kilometres north of Lisbon, is a
   worthwhile day trip. Behind the stunning yellow and green exterior of
   the stately building is a collection of magnificent Baroque, Rococo,
   and neoclassical pieces. The manicured gardens are wonderful for an
   afternoon stroll.
   Driving on from Lisbon you can visit Leiria (134 kilometres away), a
   medieval university town, and the magical town of Tomar (139 kilometres
   away). Both towns are around an hour and a half’s drive north of
   Lisbon.
   A 15-minute drive from the city centre is the beautiful palace of
   Ajuda, built in 1795 in a neoclassical style but with renovations since
   adding architectural features from different styles. The majestic
   interiors are open to the public; including several private chambers,
   and the State Rooms where galas were held. The grounds include the
   Jardim Botânico da Ajuda, the first botanical garden in Portugal, known
   for its geometric layout. The Palace of Ajuda also houses a large
   collection of decorative arts dating from the 15th to the 20th
   centuries, including jewellery, textiles, and furniture, as well as
   paintings and sculpture.
   The chic seaside town of Cascais is known for its beautiful beaches and
   superior seafood restaurants. The chosen summer retreat of the royal
   family during the late 1800s, Cascais is still very cosmopolitan, with
   a picture-perfect historic centre, sandy beaches, whimsical museums and
   trendy boutiques. Make sure you visit the Palácio da Cidadela de
   Cascais and the Castro Guimarães Museum to appreciate their unique
   architectural styles. Cascais is a quick half an hour drive along the
   east coast from Lisbon.
   Things to see in Lisbon
   This UNESCO protected city is full of diverse districts, each offering
   a unique perspective. Great things to see include the traditional
   Alfama with its Moorish architecture and hilltop castle; the cultural
   offerings of Lisbon Baixa, with the Archaeological Centre that is
   dedicated to the ruins dating back to the Iron Age; and the oldest
   confectionary shop in the country, opened in 1829. The Belém
   neighbourhood houses the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, a Unesco-listed
   monastery with awe-inspiring cloisters, gargoyles and Renaissance
   woodcarvings. Read less
