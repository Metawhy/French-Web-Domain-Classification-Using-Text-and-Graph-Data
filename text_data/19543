   Buttress (V 5.12+, 9 pitches, 1,200') climbs up and right through the
   prominent buttress. On April 1, 2008, Alex Honnold free soloed the
   route in 83 minutes. [Photo] Duncan Murray

   Alex Honnold, the upstart who shocked the Yosemite climbing community
   last summer with his free solos and speedy free ascents (read the
   October 30, 2007 NewsWire), just completed one of the most impressive
   free solos ever achieved—Moonlight Buttress (V 5.12+, 9 pitches,
   1,200'), Zion National Park, Utah—in an extraordinary eighty-three
   minutes.

   Honnold made the ropeless ascent on Tuesday, April 1, 2008. He had
   rehearsed the climb four times solo with a spool of fixed static line
   and a mini-traxion—twice on March 28 and twice again on March 29. "I'd
   eat lunch between [rehearsal ascents]," Honnold said casually; however,
   these back-to-back-to-back- to-back rehearsals within thirty-six hours
   are impressive in their own right: Moonlight is a Grade V climb with
   sustained difficulties—four of the last five pitches are 5.12a or
   harder.

   "All of it was locker. Really good, solid fingers."

   A rainy day on March 30th provided Honnold with two recovery days
   before going for the free solo on April 1. That morning he found
   himself so bitterly cold waiting for shade that around 10 a.m. he
   rushed to the climb, still in the sun. It was far warmer at the base
   than he expected, but rather than wait, Honnold shed all his layers and
   took advantage of his "giddy" mental state. "I was super excited to do
   it but kind of nervous," he said. "I had a hard time sleeping the night
   before, I was so psyched."

   Before this trip, Honnold had been to Zion only once, for a single day
   two years before. That day he flashed Moonlight with a friend and
   became enthralled with the climb. Over six weeks this winter at Indian
   Creek he birthed the idea of free soloing the classic—"I really love
   fingers—and Moonlight has really secure locker fingers—and you're in a
   really cool, exposed position," he said.

   "The grade doesn't reflect the difficulty because it's pure endurance
   5.12c. It's a matter of having the fitness for a general, sustained
   pump."

   Although Honnold said he felt secure throughout the free solo, he
   admitted that he does not enjoy liebacking. "The entire dihedral was
   the crux, but luckily it's a combination of jamming and liebacking."
   The jams were good enough, he said, that the lieback element proved
   surmountable. He reached the top in an astounding eighty-three minutes.

   Honnold also had been in conversations with a friend, Chris Weidner,
   about linking multiple free climbs, so on April 5 the pair woke up
   early and quickly dispatched Space Shot (IV 5.13a, 8 pitches, 800')
   then Moonlight. "We were toying with the idea of doing a bigger
   link-up, but the routes are not that inspiring and the rock is choss,
   except for Moonlight," Honnold said. "Space Shot is mostly just dirt.
   And even if you link three or four routes here, it's not as big as El
   Cap."

   Of these accomplishments, all completed over just a few days, Honnold
   is most proud of his speed. "What gets me really psyched is that this
   is surely the speed record [of Moonlight Buttress]," Honnold said. "I
   don't know if anyone can beat it, either. I turned on my iPod at the
   beginning, played my Top 25, rocked that to the top, and had a couple
   songs to spare."

   I look forward to the next `Alex moment`. The amazing free climbs he
   continues to make right into 2011 make me feel great, even though I
   nothing to do with them. These climbs make people feel how lucky it is
   to be alive. Keep it up Alex!

   I think efforts like this are, yes, inspirational as hell, and
   congratulations to Honnold for a successful outcome to a sustained
   effort. Base jumping may be a convenient way to get down, and wheee,
   its kinda like those rides at the amusement park, wheee!. Base jumping
   is not climbing, anyone can do it, any fool can take a risk. Base
   jumping is not interesting.

   I fully support professional climbers doing their best to help society,
   change the world, combat global warming, feed the hungry and all the
   worthy things that professional climbers do for the little people. I
   saw a film clip the other day of a professional climber in a wing suit
   regurgitating some food to a poor legless chap in a very destitute
   place (yosemite valley)? If only others could follow the lead of these
   brave, selfless souls that jump off big rocks to better the world we
   live in then we wouldn't have to pursue lame careers like nursing or
   teaching to lend a hand. Way to go professional climbers! I am
   definitely not a dis-believer in your intentions to stop the ice caps
   from melting away...

   First, great job Alex.

   Second, Steph Davis had her "hissy fit" because of one individual and
   his power trip. There were other individuals at the same time making
   their first wingsuit jumps with a similar yet adequate skillset for
   this than she, and were not being hassled. When the drop zone officer
   was contacted, he knew she had the ability to begin flying a wingsuit,
   as did many others, and he gave her the green light.

   As for being a professional climber, well, like any profession, in
   order to get paid, you have to do your job. In a climber's case this
   requires climbing a lot, and showing what you're doing. If this is
   unacceptable to you or anyone, then don't be one, and don't support
   institutions that support professional climbers, like this magazine...
   or any of the climbing magazines.... or any company that sponsors
   athletes that are doing their sport in a fashion you believe is
   unworthy of your attention. Or do it better. This is how we advance and
   learn new limits- by pushing ourselves and pushing each other.

   I'm not trying to be confrontational, I'm just providing a side to your
   story that you may not have heard. jj fuerst

   What impresses me is how humble this kid is. No film crews. No hype. No
   anticipated spread in "Alpinist." There is a huge difference between
   people like Alex, who passed me while third classing Sons of Yesterday
   back in September, and Steph Davis, who is obsessed with gaining
   noteriety for her efforts (film crews/photographers) I mean, her solo
   of the diamond did not need the attention it got. Especially after
   finding out through word of mouth, that she threw a huge hissy fit over
   not being allowed to wear the wing-suit around the same time due to an
   insufficiency of hours. "Do you know who I am?", she demanded. "Do you
   know who I am? Alex apologized to me for climbing passed me at the
   belay up on that last pitch. I'll never forget that. Who was that?, I
   wondered. Later that week, I saw him eating pizza at Curry Village. He
   looked like he slept in the woods that night. "There's that dude", I
   said to my partner...... It wasn't until after I got back home, that I
   found out what this "dude" had done in the Valley weeks before. We all
   approach what we do differently. But it is how we complete the task
   that defines us. Good job Alex.

   WOW!

   Get this kid sponsored now. Get him some shoes and a big spread in a
   magazine. Maybe he can get someone video-ing his free-solos and we can
   get him on Banff. MAybe he should write a book...awesome inspiration
   for the kids out there. Mini-traxion and all..wow. I'm flabbergasted.
   Has this kid started base-jumping with a wing-suit yet? Let's get him a
   free sponsored one real soon.

   We all thought this was an April Fool's joke and it was generally
   ignored on SuperTopo.com As the days passed into April I think we all
   started waking up to the fact that it actually happened. Amazing
   climbing! Very inspiring!

   Barry Blanchard / September 27
   In this Mountain Profile essay from Alpinist 67, which is now available
   on newsstands and in our online store, Barry Blanchard relives a couple
   of new routes that he explored with Mark Wilford in 1998 on Mt.
   Alverstone in the St. Elias Range. He recalls one particular moment: "I
   lay raw and exhausted, shouldered to the mountain and anchored to
   it.... Our ledge was two feet at its widest and nine feet long.
   Strangely, I felt secure, as if I belonged there, as if I'd been in
   land like this at some time in the past."

   by Five Ten. He found that even Unparallel's proprietary rubber is
   similar to the famous Stealth C4 rubber that Kalman has loved for many
   years. The fit and sizing of the Up Lace felt slightly different to him
   compared to the Anasazi, however. Four stars. [stars-small-4.jpg] 4 out

Mike Libecki

   From March 19-25, 2017, Mike Libecki shared some stories and photos
   with the #AlpinistCommunityProject about an expedition to Greenland in
   2015 to climb a remote, unclimbed peak, which he'd named the Polar Bear
   Fang after finding it on maps and reconnoitering the approach by boat
   on different trips through the years. He had tried to reach the
   Fang--which he is certain is in a never-before visited area--on several
   occasions, but he had been shut down nearly every time because of sea
   ice, and once because there were too many polar bears to get off the
   boat. On this last attempt, he'd planned to go alone, but that quickly
   changed.

   From October 1-6, 2018, Nina Glazunov-Neverov shared some stories and
   photos with the #AlpinistCommunityProject about the life of her husband
   Sergey Glazunov, who reached a historic highpoint with Alexander Gukov
   on the North Ridge of Latok I (7145m) in Pakistan. During their
   descent, on July 25, Sergey Glazunov fell to his death. He was only 26
   years old. Gukov was subsequently stranded for a week at 6200 meters
   before he was rescued by a dramatic helicopter operation, flown by
   Pakistani pilots Major Qazi Muhammad Mazhar-ud-Din, Major Abid Rafique,
   Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Anjum Rafique and Major Fakhar-e-Abbas.
   Sergey Glazunov had often climbed with his brother Evgeniy.
   Glazunov-Neverov said she may take some time before she pursues serious
   mountaineering again. "I want to continue Sergey's hobby but I need to
   think about this," she said. Meanwhile, she said that Evgeniy wants to
   keep supporting young mountaineers in memory of his brother.

   FLYING INTO THE ST. ELIAS MOUNTAINS is like traveling back to the
   height of the Ice Age. No trees, no soil. High mountains such as St.
   Elias, Vancouver, Logan, Kennedy, Hubbard and Alverstone rise like
   islands from an ocean of ice, and they are all that is visible from
   horizon to horizon to horizon. No human structures, no green, no life.
   If I hold a memory of this landscape, it is genetic, prehistoric and as
   ephemeral as the haze that sits on these summits on the clear middays
   when the heat comes.

   During my third flight into the St. Elias in seven years, the
   crevasse-riven Hubbard Glacier resembled sunbaked plaster, several
   thousand feet below the belly of Kurt Gloyer's plane. The pattern was
   so uniform and omnipresent that I had to remind myself it wasn't on a
   scale of square feet, but of square miles. Then we climbed over the
   Alverstone Glacier, where a satin of neve glowed dully in the post dawn
   and looked like a fjord reaching into headlands. The southwest face of
   Mt. Alverstone, the object of our desire, grew over the cowling of the
   plane. My partner Mark Wilford and I gawked and blabbed and shot
   pictures. Kurt wheeled the ship around the west ridge of the mountain:
   twin golden pillars of granite rose from the northeast basin of the
   Alverstone Glacier; their abrupt blade-like edges seized my attention
   and my imagination.

   "God, Mark, it looks like Chamonix! Like the Grand Capucin."

   I could hear Wilford's smile over the headset, as he spoke in his slow
   Coloradan drawl: "It does look good, doesn't it?"

   Kurt lowered his skis and plowed us to a stop directly on the border
   between Canada and the USA. That position seemed appropriate as I am
   Canadian and Mark is American. There were no customs, no border
   controls, and once Kurt took off, no sound. Just absolute quiet.

   ON MAY 12 AND 13, 1998, Mark and I made our attempt on the southwest
   face of Mt. Alverstone. We'd envisioned a route on granite: perfect
   cracks and golden walls tracing a path to the summit. In my mind, I
   transposed the Gervasutti Pillar of Mt. Blanc du Tacul onto Alverstone.
   Instead, we ended up climbing snow that even I could have skied. Like
   the crests of shallow desert dunes, the rock ridges lacked definition,
   and it made no sense to be on them; it was far easier to walk up the
   sand-like drifts in the trough. The face wasn't steep enough. On our
   second day, a blizzard slammed us like a Saharan sandstorm, and we
   turned tail at 14,000 feet.

   Mark descended first and set most of our rappel anchors. Despite the
   stinging onslaught of driving snow, I loved watching his competence.
   One of his anchors was a jammed knot tied in webbing, tapped into an
   upward-facing constriction in the rock and turned 180 degrees over a
   lip of granite to create a downward-facing loop through which to thread
   our ropes.

   "There! If it'll hold my fat ass, it'll hold us," Mark said. And then
   he cracked his broad-jawed Dick Tracy grin, "Best not bounce
   though...."

   Steeper rock ridge protruded from the face to the east. But like so
   much of the vertical ground I'd seen in the St. Elias, they were
   negated, for Mark and me, by serac barriers. We weren't willing to
   climb under, or through, soaring cliffs of glacier ice that were slowly
   losing their defiance of gravity. Their eventual collapses would be
   catastrophic, instantaneous and lethal.

   "I'VE NEVER SEEN an unclimbed piece of rock like that anywhere in my
   life," Mark stated. His square-cut jaw relaxed in wonder. His words
   gave me pause because I could think of few members of our generation
   who had climbed more rock than Mark had. It was now May 15, and we'd
   set a track up to the base of the Twin Pillars. They were so beautiful
   up close: parallel edges of granite that rose vertically from the
   glacier to link a ladder of corners, walls and couloirs for 2,000 feet
   until their columns angled back and fell from view and left me looking
   into the sky.

   The next day, we packed and ate and read and slept. At 1:00 a.m., May
   17, we skied toward the start of the route, carrying an alpine aid
   rack, bivy gear and two days' worth of food. The emerging light of the
   new sun had just brushed the rock from ash to gold. Fifty feet above
   me, Mark formed an X, the pick of his right axe slotted in a crack and
   the palm of his left glove pasted to the opposite wall; his legs split
   wide to set his crampon points onto edges in the granite. His attention
   was absolute and focused on a small crack in the mountain's skin. Mark
   was evaluating what size of piton to try.

   A picture of Walter Bonatti came to me from the past, and I imagined
   going back in time forty-seven years to the first ascent of the east
   face of the Grand Capucin. I pictured myself as Ghigo watching Bonatti,
   whose hands and feet traced the same X, climbing toward bulging
   slate-pale granite delineated by cold, blue sky. A quotation from Fosco
   Maraini came to me:

   To watch Bonatti climbing was to see a small red silhouette
   advancing—for all the paradox of it—effortlessly: advancing with a
   decision, a lightness of touch that made him unique.... There are
   certain talents so outstanding as to be beyond all dispute, certain
   gifts which must come straight from the gods.

   We'd climbed a breathtaking 400-foot granite corner, shaped like an
   open book, with a patina of ice and crusty snow in its spine. When the
   corner steepened to overhanging, and sheaves of granite blocks seemed
   poised to fall on us, Mark made a tension traverse to gain the apex of
   the pillar; he looked so incredibly bold out there with a forty-foot
   belly of rope between us and an Ice Age lying behind. We alternated
   left and right of the pillar's spine, free climbing as hard as we could
   in our mountain boots and, inevitably, weighting shallowly driven
   pitons when there was no other choice.

   "Man, you must have shit when that pin shifted," I said.

   "Ya," Mark chuckled, "that was pretty darn exciting. It's not all bad
   though. It keeps you on your toes."

   Late in the day, Mark climbed a perfect lead: he left one crack, and
   with the slow precision of a tai chi master, he traversed to a second
   to continue up a sweeping, planar wall of tawny granite, the hardest
   free climbing on the route. It was amazing to see him put the pitch
   together—his figure set against the backdrop of jagged peaks that
   thrust from the flat, white expanse of what could have been a
   continental ice sheet. Mark and I were the only humans visible, and
   that solitude felt unique, singular, polar.... The St. Elias is still
   in the grips of the Pleistocene, and yet I felt wisps of connection:
   some stirred my soul, like the sight of Mark climbing above me with his
   bare hands; others seemed to evoke menacing echoes, like the feeling
   when dusk came and the temperature plummeted and sweat cracked to ice
   within my clothing and I feared hypothermia and frostbite. All that awe
   and distress was hardwired to my primal sense of heat, or the lack of
   it.

   We climbed eleven pitches that day. Nightfall, and the cold, came, and
   Mark and I dug a long, narrow ledge in the snow. Later, the sky
   blackened to velvet. Solely, the black edge of rock overhanging us—and
   that edge black entirely and absent of stars—defined earth as different
   from space. The air froze until it was calm and cold, and Mark and I
   were the only heat, the only blood. I lay raw and exhausted, shouldered
   to the mountain and anchored to it. I kept my legs ramrod straight,
   knowing that if I folded them, my hamstrings would contract into
   cramps, the power of which scared me. Our ledge was two feet at its
   widest and nine feet long. Strangely, I felt secure, as if I belonged
   there, as if I'd been in land like this at some time in the past. My
   people, the Metis, are the mixed blood of Canada, born largely of
   Indigenous women and French and Scottish fur traders. Two hundred years
   ago, we made our living hunting buffalo on horseback. Had any of my
   Indigenous ancestors passed through here, more than 10,000 years prior,
   on their way farther south? Had Tlingit people seen the golden pillars
   where Mark and I lay now?

   THE NEXT DAY, A STORM ROSE from the Pacific and swirled up the Hubbard
   and Alverstone glaciers like grey floodwater. After fourteen hours of
   climbing, we'd gotten up a dozen more pitches stitched together with
   two diagonal rappels. The wind compressed to gale force, and when I
   kicked to the ridgeline, I had to lay my chest on the course, compact
   snow, so I could see over the other side. It was hard to stand, and the
   temperature was falling again. We'd forgo the summit in favor of
   getting off of the mountain.

   "I'm getting tired," Mark said, and he blew out like a horse and
   lowered his head against the force of the wind. "I don't want to make
   any mistakes."

   We sat on our packs with our backs to the wind and rested, and then we
   struggled our way west along the ridge for two-thirds of a mile to gain
   a forty-degree gully to down climb. By midnight, the blizzard had
   engulfed the glacier, and we dragged our skis from where we'd stashed
   them forty-five hours earlier—to where we thought we'd be clear of any
   avalanches. We lay down in the snow in our bivy sacks and sleeping bags
   and on top of our insulation pads. And then, like huskies, we let the
   snow drift over us. I wasn't warm enough until I added my big parka
   inside my sleeping bag. If I could have put my nose in my butt and my
   tail over my eyes, I would have.

   WE DECIDED TO NAME OUR ROUTE "The Pugilist at Rest"—I'd brought the
   book along and read it, cover to cover, twice; when I'd handed it to
   Mark, he'd done the same.

   "It was one hell of a fight to get off of that thing," I said.

   "Yes, it was a scrap, but it was one hell of a route."

   "Yes it was, buddy. Yes it was."

Perspective: Robbi Mecus

   "Perspective is a curious lens," climber and forest ranger Robbi Mecus
   says. "If I never turn my gaze to the side, my interpretation of the
   world becomes static, unempathetic. Changing my vantage point brings me
   a fuller understanding. It brings me compassion. My life has been a
   constant shifting of perspective." In the first part of this episode,
   Mecus talks about some of her earliest climbing memories and her work
   in search and rescue. In the second part of the episode, Mecus reads
   from her Alpinist 65 essay "Perspective," in which she reflects on how
   coming out as transgender has shifted her lens on climbing.

   Over the years, her contributions have included such cartoon classics
   as "The Alpine Oracle" ("Before ya leave on yer next climbin trip...")
   and "The Climbing-Lit Editor's Nightmare" ("Hey Writers! Use these
   moldy phrases in yer manuscripts & win me a cup of burnt coffee"), in
   addition to more serious fare (the Squamish Mountain Profile, spanning
   decades of climbing lore in British Columbia). Now, in conversation

Climbing Doesn't Change You: Kathy Karlo

   "We all have emotions that eventually bring us to self-awareness, if we
   let them. Beneath every curmudgeonly old soul is the ability to share a
   passion and appreciate something that makes us feel deeply.... It's
   true--climbing does not change you. But having a passion for something
   is what will." Kathy Karlo is a climber, writer, and the director of
   the website and podcast, both titled "For the Love of Climbing." In
   this episode, Karlo talks about her Alpinist 61 article, "Climbing
   Doesn't Change You," and how writing openly about vulnerability within
   the context of climbing can be a radical act.

   James Edward Mills

The Adventure Gap: James Edward Mills

   "If someone is raised to spend time in the outdoors it will be
   something that they do without question; they won't wonder whether or
   not it's something that they're supposed to do based on their ethnic or
   racial identity or how they go through life.... Unfortunately too many
   people in our culture and our society are deprived of that
   opportunity."

   An avid climber and the author of The Adventure Gap: Changing the Face
   of the Outdoors, James Edward Mills has worked in the outdoor industry
   for decades. As team journalist, he chronicled the 2013 journey of
   Expedition Denali, a project conceived to put the first team of African
   Americans on the summit of the highest point of North America. In this
   episode, Mills talks with associate editor Paula Wright about the
   adventure gap and the relationship between mountaineering and the civil
   rights movement.

Art of Freedom: Bernadette McDonald and Voytek Kurtyka

   Perhaps no other writer has explored Cold War and post-Soviet era
   mountaineering more than Bernadette McDonald has. In this episode,
   Bernadette McDonald discusses her award-winning book, Art of Freedom, a
   biography of Voytek Kurtyka, one of the most accomplished, and
   reclusive, alpinists of our time. Known for his philosophical approach,
   Kurtyka believed in the transformative power of climbing. He wrote,
   "When we entrust our faith to an absurdly beautiful mountain, we are
   being true to our vocation.... This is why I find climbing to be one of
   the most encouraging and exhilarating efforts of my life. This is the
   drug of mountaineering--the liberation."

Stillness and Storms: Mayan Smith-Gobat

   In 2002, Mayan Smith--Gobat was in a ski accident and broke her jaw and
   both feet. Within a few weeks, she turned her focus to climbing and
   began training while her feet were still in casts. Nine years later,
   she became the second woman ever to free climb the Salathe Wall on El
   Capitan. Today, she's concentrating on Riders on the Storm, a
   1,300--meter big wall on the icy east face of Torre Central in Chilean
   Patagonia, which still hasn't had a free ascent. For more on this
   climb, check out Smith-Gobat's article "Stillness and Storms" in Issue
   55 of Alpinist magazine.

Mountaineering and Climate Change

   At altitude, many mountain communities are already experiencing the
   severe consequences of climate change. Climbers have reported
   witnessing the effects of warming temperatures as well, from receding
   glaciers to increasing rockfall. In this episode, associate editor
   Paula Wright discusses climate change impacts on mountain environments
   with climbers and researchers, including Mark Carey, Pasang Yangjee

   FRIGID ARCTIC AIR CRACKLED like static electricity. Our solitary world
   on the glacier was as silent as the north face of Mt. Kennedy that
   loomed above. For hours, Jack Roberts and I scrutinized the colossal
   6,000-foot wall, hoping to connect the strands of this giant arctic
   spider web of ice. Jack's spotting scope revealed a gossamer thread of
   dull, grey ice through the initial 3,000-foot granite headwall.

   "It looks pretty damn cold up there," Jack observed.

   Neither of us had climbed anything this daunting. Dark recesses lined
   the immense, ominous face, which was devoid of sun. Ubiquitous seracs
   and cornices threatened every possible route. Slowly, the wall unveiled
   itself and began to reveal its hidden passageways. Tomorrow, we would
   thrust ourselves into the breach.

   I FIRST BECAME AWARE of the North Ridge of Mt. Kennedy from a Bradford
   Washburn photograph taken during his 1935 National Geographic Yukon
   Expedition. This striking line resembled the spectacular North Ridge of
   K2. How could you not want to climb this?

   David Seidman and Todd Thompson had first completed this perfect
   continuous line to the summit of Mt. Kennedy in 1968, as part of an
   expedition that included Joe Faint and Philip Koch. Another team
   repeated the climb in 1977. Both ascents used fixed lines and fixed
   camps. In 1978 I ventured there with a group of friends from Oregon.
   Our goal was to make a continuous alpine-style push with a small bivy
   tent, sleeping bags, a hanging stove and just four days of food and
   fuel.

   Four of us skied seventy-five miles from the Alcan Highway to our base
   camp directly below the North Ridge. After 1,500 feet of climbing, we
   were thwarted by endless storms, hazardous avalanche conditions and
   ass-deep snow. Subsequently, we managed to get up some minor peaks
   around the Kennedy Glacier area, but after six weeks we skied out
   disappointed and disillusioned.

   For the next fifteen years, the core of the Alaska Range drew me
   farther north, but Kennedy remained engrained in my mind. In 1994 I
   received a call from Jack Roberts asking if I was interested in
   climbing Mt. Kennedy. He was captivated by the same Washburn photo that
   I had obsessed about sixteen years earlier. We'd never climbed together
   before, but we knew about each other's accomplishments in the Alaska
   Range. Jack suggested we look at the mountain's unattempted north face.
   There, we envisioned a line that would incorporate the latest tools,
   techniques, and alpine-ice and mixed-climbing standards into a larger
   scale than either of us had previously tried.

   In May 1995, Jack and I headed north to the Yukon. A climbing grant
   allowed us to fly in to the range, rather than having to ski in from
   the Alcan Highway. Lamentably, our lackadaisical pilot landed us on the
   Lowell Glacier, which was still five miles away from our intended base
   camp below Mt. Kennedy's north face. Nice! At least, with two days of
   ferrying loads and dragging gear-laden sleds over the adjacent glacier,
   we had the opportunity to study the face in detail.

   "Do you see any place for the tent in the first 3,000 feet?" I asked.

   "Not really," Jack replied. There was nowhere we could chop a ledge
   large enough to sit, much less pitch a tent.

   Fairbanks

   TWO DAYS LATER, after much angst and debate, we switched our objective
   to the North Ridge, which still had not been successfully climbed in
   alpine style. We moved over 2,000 feet of solid neve and alpine ice
   efficiently in twelve hours. In the distance, though, we could see an
   impending storm brewing, racing toward us from the west across the
   Hubbard Glacier. Begrudgingly, we bailed off the route and arrived at
   base camp as the storm hit. Snow fell for the next three days, ending
   our trip.

   A year afterward, we came back with a new strategy and better equipment
   for the north face: a portaledge, which we'd haul for the first 3,000
   feet, and a lightweight I-Tent for the rest of the route. On May 3, a
   new pilot landed us directly below the face. Once the plane droned out
   of sight, all fell silent again. Three days later, Jack and I started
   up the climb. "Into the breach once again," I muttered aloud, as much
   to myself as to Jack.

   Four pitches up the headwall, "the business" began. Fortunately, more
   ice had formed in the past year than in '95, so the line appeared
   continuous. As the headwall steepened, a wide crack presented itself as
   the only weakness in the otherwise blank, monolithic rock. I traversed
   left for thirty feet and then groveled my way up the unprotected
   eight-inch crack for fifty feet with no gear, before I could place a
   tied-off Spectre and an equalized stubby ice screw. At the belay, Jack
   commented, "When did your cojones get that big?"

   "Necessity is the mother of invention," I responded.

   Fourteen hours later, we'd climbed a thousand feet above the
   bergschrund. The steep, technical pitches made for protracted belays,
   and hours of hanging in slings meant suffering for the belayer. Above a
   vast abyss, Jack led with grace and poise, connecting bare stone to
   thin ice patches with scant rock protection. When I reached the end of
   this traverse, I paused to absorb the brief warmth of the sun on my
   cheeks. It was the only time I'd felt sun on my skin in three days.

   That night, the temperature dropped to thirty fucking degrees below
   zero. As Jack and I took refuge inside the "blue cocoon," it started to
   snow. We'd made the mistake of erecting the portaledge directly in the
   midst of a spindrift trough, where we were pummeled by snow all night
   long. Clearly, an avalanche might sweep us away. In an exercise of
   vital discipline, we went out into the storm to move the portaledge.
   Twenty feet away, we found a protected overhang to secure our home. The
   process took hours, and we both got completely soaked and fully
   hypothermic. But we were safe.

   Forty-eight hours later, the storm finally broke. As we racked up, my
   feet were hanging over the ledge. I snapped a crampon heel lever, and I
   reached around to attach my safety strap on my second crampon. It burst
   off my boot. I hadn't centered the heel lever correctly, and it had
   exploded under pressure. I watched as the crampon plummeted thousands
   of feet below me and disappeared from sight. Stunned, I invoked what
   I've always called "the high altitude" vocabulary: the seven or so
   words that you couldn't say on television (at least in 1996).

   With the nearest replacement crampon at base camp, we had an intense
   discussion about our options. I told Jack I would deal with the one
   crampon since it was my fault it was gone. We had enough food and fuel
   still, and the weather seemed to be improving. I remember saying
   repeatedly, "We are not going down!" I finally convinced Jack that we
   should go on; to his credit, he agreed to lead all the pitches.

   For the next three pitches, I followed Jack's horizontal ice traverses
   by improvising a routine that resembled a circus act. After removing
   the ice screws, I'd cinch the jumars against the next protective
   anchor, thirty to forty feet to my right, and then I'd simply push off!
   After an exciting pendulum (Isn't the first rule of ice climbing—don't
   fall?), I'd then jumar in a straight line up to the next ice screw,
   remove it and repeat the process. Jack watched, bemused by my
   predicament, while my strategy once again confirmed what all climbing
   really is. It's problem solving.

   After a crucial night's sleep, we awoke to a clear morning. We
   abandoned the haul bag and portaledge but left them anchored as a
   backup in case we needed to retreat. Jack and I shouldered our
   thirty-pound sacks and headed toward an icefield. It was windy, and the
   sun still didn't reach this part of the upper face. This day was the
   coldest I remember on the entire climb.

   Midday, I had a flash of insight. "So, what size are your boots, man?"
   I asked Jack. Lo and behold, we had the same size feet. Now Jack didn't
   have to endure the unfair burden of leading every pitch. Every time we
   exchanged a crampon at the belay, we clipped it in with six slings:
   losing another crampon at this point would be FUBAR.

   By the end of the day, we'd intersected with the existing North Ridge
   route. One thousand five hundred feet below the summit, we chopped a
   ledge and collapsed into cramped quarters. Once again, in the middle of
   the night, it started to snow. For two days, spindrift avalanches
   hammered our tent. Hours passed without either of us speaking. Our
   sleeping bags became frozen solid clumps of feathers. Jack's knuckles
   swelled to twice their normal size.

   When the second storm abated, we'd been on the face for over nine days.
   With almost no food or fuel left, we were at a crossroads. The slopes
   above us were clearly unstable, and we were convinced that continuing
   up the North Ridge would kill us if we went for the summit. We decided
   to go down, or initially sideways, to be accurate. Jack went first, and
   I struggled to follow on one crampon, hopping and half-sliding until
   Jack could help pull me into the anchor. Slab avalanches frequently
   knocked us off our feet. Two days and thirty-six rappels later, I
   finally crossed the bergschrund, collapsed in the sun and watched Jack
   finish the last rappel. Back at base camp, we enjoyed real food, good
   Scotch and a Cuban cigar.

   H. ADAMS CARTER, an American Alpine Journal editor and a close friend
   of Bradford Washburn, once told me, "Good judgment is only as a result
   of having survived bad judgment." Jack and I felt good about our
   success of climbing the north face by a new route that was both
   technically challenging and aesthetic. Later, with more time for
   reflection, we admitted that, ultimately, we had failed. Summits do
   matter, but it's irresponsible to push for them when the cards are so
   profoundly stacked against you. We'd each collectively survived decades
   of making dubious decisions in the mountains. Our decision to descend
   instead of going for the top was not only the correct call but also the
   only call.

   So, even though we didn't reach the summit, Jack and I agreed it was
   the best climb either of us never did. Over the next couple of years
   after Mt. Kennedy, we attempted other major routes with limited
   success, and we drifted apart. In December 2011, during the Bozeman Ice
   Festival, we reconnected over Scotch and renewed our friendship. Three
   weeks later, on January 15, 2012, in Telluride, Colorado, while
   climbing Bridal Veil Falls, a route he'd done at least a dozen times,
   Jack took a sixty-foot leader fall on the second pitch. He died at the
   scene.

   Before we left the glacier, I'd chosen the name Arctic Discipline for
   our eleven days of hardship on the wall. As an example of his sense of
   humor, Jack later chose the name A Pair of Jacks. I wish Jack were
   still here so we could swing leads again, banter over Scotch and rib
   each other about how one route could have two names, and which one is
   right?

   Years later, I still reflect upon the solace, joy and suffering we
   experienced together. Miles from nowhere, totally dependent on each
   other, in a cold, wild place of solitude, beauty and peace.
