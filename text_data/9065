   Will Happen

   Back in March 2016, Microsoft extended an invitation to other online
   networks to connect to Xbox Live to allow cross-play between Xbox and
   competing consoles. The head-turning announcement made waves, as this
   has never happened before. At E3, Microsoft and Nintendo announced a
   partnership for Minecraft cross-play between Xbox and Nintendo Switch,
   but Sony has held out. The company says it won't connect PlayStation
   Network to outside networks, in part because it fears for the safety of
   its users.

   Now, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has provided an update on where things
   stand with Sony. He told us at the Brazil Game Show today that
   Microsoft speaks with Sony all the time, but the conversations haven't
   amounted to anything--and they may never.

   "We talk to Sony all the time. With Minecraft on PlayStation, we have
   to be one of the biggest games on their platform in terms of sales and
   gameplay," Spencer said. "Same with Nintendo. The relationship with
   Nintendo on this front has been strong. They've been great supporters
   and we continue to collaborate with them. But I think Sony's view is
   different. They should talk about what their view is..."

   Asked if cross-play between Xbox One and PS4 is a lost cause, Spencer
   said he doesn't want to speak for Sony. Nothing is ever set in stone,
   but the way things are now with Sony makes Spencer believe the company
   may never come around.

   "I have a real struggle making comments about their motivation or
   timelines. I know there is a certain view that says if my friends have
   this console, they can't play with people who buy another console.
   That's a reason they go buy my console," he said. "That reason is not
   going to go away. So we're putting Minecraft out there as one of the
   biggest games on any platform and allowing people to play together
   regardless of what device they bought. I don't think everybody is
   taking that same approach to the ecosystem. So I'm never going to call
   anything a lost cause but I think some of the fundamental reasons and
   certain scenarios, they're not really going away. So I don't know what
   would change."

   Speaking generally about the appeal of cross-play, Spencer said it
   allows the multiplayer environments for games to stay rich, because the
   player pools are larger than they otherwise might be.

   "I think people look at [cross-play] and say is it better for gamers.
   If it's better for gamers, I have a hard time thinking why we shouldn't
   go do this, especially when you're trying to make the gaming business a
   bigger business; grow it, get more games, create more opportunity," he
   said. "Especially in the indie space, actually. If you're creating an
   online indie game and you're going to create five [shards] of your
   game--the Steam version, Xbox Live on PC, Xbox version, the PlayStation
   version, the Switch version creates hard matchmaking scenarios. We
   should help developers, not make their lives more difficult."

   Getting cross-play up and running between Xbox One and PS4 is not a
   technical issue, as Epic's Fortnite accidentally added this recently
   before quickly removing it. It's a matter of politics and deal-making,
   it seems, between Microsoft and Sony. Rocket League developer Psyonix
   has said it's just waiting on Microsoft and Sony to give the go-ahead
   to unlock cross-play.

   Our conversation with Spencer covered a number of other topics, and you

   One of the pleasant surprises Microsoft had in store for E3 this year
   was the announcement of Xbox One backwards compatibility support for
   original Xbox games. At the Brazil Game Show, we caught up with Xbox
   boss Phil Spencer, who provided some insight into where things stand
   with the upcoming feature.

   "We're close, we're really close," Spencer said when asked for the
   status of Xbox backwards compatibility. "I have a little dashboard I go
   to and I can see all the games [and] where they are in getting
   approvals in the pipeline. I know the games that are coming for the
   original Xbox but I don't think we've announced them all. We have to do
   this in partnership with partners, but we're still on track. I feel
   really good. The games look great."

   Spencer also remains confident that the feature will be out before the
   end of the year, as planned. "Oh yeah," he said about his certainty of
   a 2017 launch. He also teased that there are still details about
   backwards compatibility will work on Xbox One X that have yet to be
   revealed: "There's some stuff we're going to talk about in that space
   in terms of how compatibility's going to work on [Xbox One] X
   specifically that I think people will find pretty interesting.

   "Some of the games hold up really well; some of them don't. But the
   gameplay mechanics and the smile [you got] on your face 15 years ago
   playing those games, those are things that are still there. I see it,
   like getting back to playing Crimson Skies, [it's] fantastic, and the
   game actually looks really good even though it's obviously been
   around."

   Spencer mentioning Crimson Skies is expected, as it's only one of two
   games--along with Fuzion Frenzy--that have been confirmed as part of
   the program. "We have multiple games up and running--we just decided to
   tease the first one[s]," Microsoft executive Dave McCarthy explained
   about Microsoft's E3 reveal of the first two games. "There will be a
   library of games available, for sure." However, you shouldn't expect
   the library to be as big as that of Xbox 360 backwards compatible
   games.

It's all speculation for now but the clues are lining up.

   Overwatch may be coming to another platform: Nintendo Switch. Though
   there's been no confirmation or official indication by Blizzard, a leak
   of a related product on Amazon could suggest an announcement is coming
   soon.

   Reset Era user Lady Bow discovered an Amazon listing for an
   Overwatch-themed Switch protection case. The listing has since been
   pulled, so we've reached out to the supposed creators of the case,
   PowerA, and Overwatch developer Blizzard, to determine its
   authenticity.

   Alone, this might be very little. But in an interview with GameSpot
   last year, Blizzard senior producer Pete Stilwell said that the studio
   used the process of porting Diablo III to Switch as an opportunity to
   familiarize itself with the capabilities of Nintendo's current
   hardware. At the time, Stilwell was adamant that Blizzard came away
   from the experience deciding to only work on a Switch port for Diablo
   III. However, he did go on to say that a Switch port for Overwatch is
   "feasible," unlike StarCraft II.

   An Overwatch-themed Switch case might be made without a
   port--especially since Amazon has a history of leaking products by
   listing tie-ins early--but it's also totally possible. The leak could
   also just be fake, so take our speculation with a grain of salt.
   However, these clues do seem to at least suggest it's possible Blizzard
   might be getting ready to announce a new Overwatch Switch port at
   BlizzCon 2019. The next most opportune venue for a big announcement
   such as this would be BlizzCon 2019, which is scheduled to begin on
   November 1. That's just close enough that Blizzard may have already
   reached out to third-party vendors like PowerA to begin production on a
   Switch case to go with the new port.

   Or maybe Nintendo will just announce that Tracer is coming to Super
   Smash Bros. Ultimate. Who knows?

   Overwatch is available on Xbox One, PS4, and PC. In GameSpot's
   Overwatch review, Mike Mahardy wrote, "Overwatch encourages a more
   tangible sort of progression: that of filling a critical role on your
   team and understanding its intricacies the more you play, adapt, and
   grow. There is a genuine learning process here. There is real value to
   the time you spend understanding these overlapping systems. It's that
   intoxicating path of discovery that makes Overwatch so varied, so
   rewarding, and ultimately another seminal release from developer
   Blizzard. Overwatch is an intelligent cascade of disparate ideas,
   supporting one another, pouring into one another, and coiling around
   themselves as they flow into the brilliant shooter underneath."

Microsoft talks to Sony "all the time," according to Spencer, but the
conversations haven't gone anywhere.

   Now Playing: GS News Update: Xbox Boss Unsure If Cross-Play With PS4
   Will Happen

   Back in March 2016, Microsoft extended an invitation to other online
   networks to connect to Xbox Live to allow cross-play between Xbox and
   competing consoles. The head-turning announcement made waves, as this
   has never happened before. At E3, Microsoft and Nintendo announced a
   partnership for Minecraft cross-play between Xbox and Nintendo Switch,
   but Sony has held out. The company says it won't connect PlayStation
   Network to outside networks, in part because it fears for the safety of
   its users.

   Now, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has provided an update on where things
   stand with Sony. He told us at the Brazil Game Show today that
   Microsoft speaks with Sony all the time, but the conversations haven't
   amounted to anything--and they may never.

   "We talk to Sony all the time. With Minecraft on PlayStation, we have
   to be one of the biggest games on their platform in terms of sales and
   gameplay," Spencer said. "Same with Nintendo. The relationship with
   Nintendo on this front has been strong. They've been great supporters
   and we continue to collaborate with them. But I think Sony's view is
   different. They should talk about what their view is..."

   Asked if cross-play between Xbox One and PS4 is a lost cause, Spencer
   said he doesn't want to speak for Sony. Nothing is ever set in stone,
   but the way things are now with Sony makes Spencer believe the company
   may never come around.

   "I have a real struggle making comments about their motivation or
   timelines. I know there is a certain view that says if my friends have
   this console, they can't play with people who buy another console.
   That's a reason they go buy my console," he said. "That reason is not
   going to go away. So we're putting Minecraft out there as one of the
   biggest games on any platform and allowing people to play together
   regardless of what device they bought. I don't think everybody is
   taking that same approach to the ecosystem. So I'm never going to call
   anything a lost cause but I think some of the fundamental reasons and
   certain scenarios, they're not really going away. So I don't know what
   would change."

   Speaking generally about the appeal of cross-play, Spencer said it
   allows the multiplayer environments for games to stay rich, because the
   player pools are larger than they otherwise might be.

   "I think people look at [cross-play] and say is it better for gamers.
   If it's better for gamers, I have a hard time thinking why we shouldn't
   go do this, especially when you're trying to make the gaming business a
   bigger business; grow it, get more games, create more opportunity," he
   said. "Especially in the indie space, actually. If you're creating an
   online indie game and you're going to create five [shards] of your
   game--the Steam version, Xbox Live on PC, Xbox version, the PlayStation
   version, the Switch version creates hard matchmaking scenarios. We
   should help developers, not make their lives more difficult."

   Getting cross-play up and running between Xbox One and PS4 is not a
   technical issue, as Epic's Fortnite accidentally added this recently
   before quickly removing it. It's a matter of politics and deal-making,
   it seems, between Microsoft and Sony. Rocket League developer Psyonix
   has said it's just waiting on Microsoft and Sony to give the go-ahead
   to unlock cross-play.

   Our conversation with Spencer covered a number of other topics, and you
   can check out the stories below to learn more.

   Now Playing: GS News Update: Xbox One's Original Xbox Backwards
   Compatibility Is Still Coming In 2017

   One of the pleasant surprises Microsoft had in store for E3 this year
   was the announcement of Xbox One backwards compatibility support for
   original Xbox games. At the Brazil Game Show, we caught up with Xbox
   boss Phil Spencer, who provided some insight into where things stand
   with the upcoming feature.

   "We're close, we're really close," Spencer said when asked for the
   status of Xbox backwards compatibility. "I have a little dashboard I go
   to and I can see all the games [and] where they are in getting
   approvals in the pipeline. I know the games that are coming for the
   original Xbox but I don't think we've announced them all. We have to do
   this in partnership with partners, but we're still on track. I feel
   really good. The games look great."

   Spencer also remains confident that the feature will be out before the
   end of the year, as planned. "Oh yeah," he said about his certainty of
   a 2017 launch. He also teased that there are still details about
   backwards compatibility will work on Xbox One X that have yet to be
   revealed: "There's some stuff we're going to talk about in that space
   in terms of how compatibility's going to work on [Xbox One] X
   specifically that I think people will find pretty interesting.

   "Some of the games hold up really well; some of them don't. But the
   gameplay mechanics and the smile [you got] on your face 15 years ago
   playing those games, those are things that are still there. I see it,
   like getting back to playing Crimson Skies, [it's] fantastic, and the
   game actually looks really good even though it's obviously been
   around."

   Spencer mentioning Crimson Skies is expected, as it's only one of two
   games--along with Fuzion Frenzy--that have been confirmed as part of
   the program. "We have multiple games up and running--we just decided to
   tease the first one[s]," Microsoft executive Dave McCarthy explained
   about Microsoft's E3 reveal of the first two games. "There will be a
   library of games available, for sure." However, you shouldn't expect
   the library to be as big as that of Xbox 360 backwards compatible
   games.

Amazon Leak Hints At Possible Overwatch Switch Port, But In A Roundabout Way

It's all speculation for now but the clues are lining up.

   Overwatch may be coming to another platform: Nintendo Switch. Though
   there's been no confirmation or official indication by Blizzard, a leak
   of a related product on Amazon could suggest an announcement is coming
   soon.

   Reset Era user Lady Bow discovered an Amazon listing for an
   Overwatch-themed Switch protection case. The listing has since been
   pulled, so we've reached out to the supposed creators of the case,
   PowerA, and Overwatch developer Blizzard, to determine its
   authenticity.

     — Wario64 (@Wario64) August 26, 2019

   Alone, this might be very little. But in an interview with GameSpot
   last year, Blizzard senior producer Pete Stilwell said that the studio
   used the process of porting Diablo III to Switch as an opportunity to
   familiarize itself with the capabilities of Nintendo's current
   hardware. At the time, Stilwell was adamant that Blizzard came away
   from the experience deciding to only work on a Switch port for Diablo
   III. However, he did go on to say that a Switch port for Overwatch is
   "feasible," unlike StarCraft II.

   An Overwatch-themed Switch case might be made without a
   port--especially since Amazon has a history of leaking products by
   listing tie-ins early--but it's also totally possible. The leak could
   also just be fake, so take our speculation with a grain of salt.
   However, these clues do seem to at least suggest it's possible Blizzard
   might be getting ready to announce a new Overwatch Switch port at
   BlizzCon 2019. The next most opportune venue for a big announcement
   such as this would be BlizzCon 2019, which is scheduled to begin on
   November 1. That's just close enough that Blizzard may have already
   reached out to third-party vendors like PowerA to begin production on a
   Switch case to go with the new port.

   Or maybe Nintendo will just announce that Tracer is coming to Super
   Smash Bros. Ultimate. Who knows?

   Overwatch is available on Xbox One, PS4, and PC. In GameSpot's
   Overwatch review, Mike Mahardy wrote, "Overwatch encourages a more
   tangible sort of progression: that of filling a critical role on your
   team and understanding its intricacies the more you play, adapt, and
   grow. There is a genuine learning process here. There is real value to
   the time you spend understanding these overlapping systems. It's that
   intoxicating path of discovery that makes Overwatch so varied, so
   rewarding, and ultimately another seminal release from developer
   Blizzard. Overwatch is an intelligent cascade of disparate ideas,
   supporting one another, pouring into one another, and coiling around
   themselves as they flow into the brilliant shooter underneath."
