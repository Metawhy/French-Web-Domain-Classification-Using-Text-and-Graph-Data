   It took a couple of days longer than I thought it would. The tyres are
   225 40 18 on a Audi TT and they are ok. So far good in all
   weathers,they have not lost grip yet, I will get them again. For price
   very good. Happy with tyres and company.

   Report - Pawel P. 2019-01-22
   Simply great tyres, no wonder they won so many tests. I had set of
   Bridgestone Potenza S001 before, which were good tyres too and lasted
   for 32000km in my Seat Ibiza Cupra. Pilot Sport 4 gives less noise and
   a excellent grip and handling in both wet and dry. I'm super happy with
   the purchase so far. I hope ware will be at least as good as
   Bridgestone had.

   I can’t speak highly enough of the fast delivery and quality tyres at a
   very reasonable choice. After putting a few thousand kilometres on the
   tyres they have plenty of both wet and dry grip. I’ve no negative
   comments at all.

   Nexen manufacture good quality tyres providing decent grip, improved
   fuel economy and low road noise but which are not particularly durable
   or long lasting compared to other brands I have used. Good value for
   the money certainly. Tyreleader provide a first class service in all
   respects.
