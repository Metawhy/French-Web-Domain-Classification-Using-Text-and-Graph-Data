Disaster in the Alps

Thousands of people flock to the Alps each year to ski tour high-elevation
routes, spending comfortable nights in a string of huts that serve wine and
hot meals. This spring, a group of experienced skiers and their guide were
trapped in a storm overnight on an exposed saddle. By morning, nearly all
were dead or dying.

   At 6:30 a.m. on Sunday, April 29, 2018, a group of ten skiers set out
   from a secluded mountain hut more than 9,000 feet up in the Swiss Alps.
   Perched on the top of a rocky hill surrounded by towering peaks and
   mountainsides, the Dix hut is a quirky, three-story stone building with
   a beautiful, south-facing terrace. It’s a popular stopover for skiers
   traversing the Alps on multiday tours that combine backcountry skiing
   with a surprising level of overnight comfort.

   The sky was just getting light as the group put on their skis and
   headed for the Cabane des Vignettes—another alpine refuge, about six
   hours away, across high-alpine terrain filled with glaciers, cols,
   peaks, and magnificent slopes of unbroken snow. It was the fourth day
   of a planned six-day tour between Chamonix, France, and Zermatt,
   Switzerland.

   Ski touring has been a popular sport in the Alps for a long time. The
   Haute Route, as the Chamonix-Zermatt crossing is sometimes called, was
   first skied in 1911 and remains the most iconic of the touring routes
   in the region. As one Swiss mountain guide put it, “Pretty much any ski
   tourer, one day or another, wants to do the Haute Route at least once
   in his life.”

   As a result, that group of ten skiers was just one of many in the Dix
   hut that morning, which can accommodate up to 120 guests at a time. All
   told, some 2,000 skiers travel the Haute Route every year in a season
   that begins in early March and runs, if conditions allow, well into
   May. The Alps, unlike most backcountry skiing areas in North America,
   are easily accessible. A 20-minute gondola ride from numerous town
   parking lots deposits you directly onto routes at elevations as high as
   12,000 feet. Skiers are supported by a broad, international network of
   full-service alpine huts like the Dix and Vignettes. In addition to
   providing heated group bunk rooms with mattresses and pillows, the huts
   offer hot meals, wine, beer, and internet access. Most supply plastic
   slippers for the guests.

   The hospitality provided by the huts, or refuges, as they’re known in
   France, has long been a part of the Alpine experience and tradition.
   But the comfy overnight accommodations, along with access that makes
   even a 112-mile tour like the Chamonix-Zermatt route possible in a six-
   or seven-day vacation, also increase the appeal and popularity of the
   tours. And while some skiers opt to self-organize their trips, the
   logistics involved in getting space in the crowded huts, as well as the
   inherent hazards in high-alpine backcountry skiing, lead many people to
   hire trained mountain guides to help them plan and navigate.

   The Dix group was no exception. It consisted of eight paying customers,
   all seasoned mountain enthusiasts and skiers, led by a professional
   mountain guide and his wife.

   One of the skiers was Tommaso Piccioli, a 50-year-old architect from
   Milan, Italy, who began ski touring in 1990 and had been a member of
   the Alpine Club of Milan for more than 20 years. Over that time, he’d
   self-organized numerous ski tours, canoe trips, mountain biking
   expeditions, and hiking trips for himself and friends in Europe and
   Australia. Accompanying Piccioli on the tour were three friends from
   the Bolzano Alpine Club of Italy, where he’d taken several
   mountaineering courses over the past couple years. Elisabetta Paolucci,
   a 44-year-old Italian teacher, began ski touring with her father when
   she was still a young girl and had recently taken a year’s sabbatical
   to pursue sailing and mountain adventures. Marcello Alberti and his
   wife, Gabriella Bernardi, were both experienced climbers and ski
   tourers as well.

   “We usually organize our trips by ourselves,” Piccioli explained. “But
   this time, because of the logistics––it’s not easy to book the huts––we
   got a guide.”

   The others in the group included Francesca Von Felten, who was a member
   of the Parma Alpine Club and an experienced climber and skier. She had
   summited Aconcagua, the tallest peak in South America, the year before.
   There was Andrea Grigioni, a 45-year-old nurse from a small town
   northwest of Milan; a 72-year-old from Ticino, Switzerland, whom
   Piccioli described as “a very strong man”; a German woman from Munich;
   and the guide’s 52-year-old wife, Kalina Damyanova. Piccioli didn’t
   know any of the guests besides his friends but noted that after the
   first couple days of the trip, “You could see they were experienced. We
   were all at the same level.”

   The guide leading the group had an impressive mountain résumé as well.
   Mario Castiglioni was a 59-year-old veteran mountaineer from Como,
   Italy, who in 1992 founded his own guiding company, MLG Mountain Guide,
   based out of Chiasso, Switzerland. He’d successfully summited four of
   the Seven Summits, three 8,000-meter peaks in the Himalayas, and a host
   of other notable mountains and routes around the world. It was because
   of that experience––and the fact that Castiglioni was a native Italian
   speaker––that Piccioli’s group selected MLG Mountain Guide for the
   friends’ ski tour.

   Initially, the group had planned to travel from Dix to a hut called
   Nacamuli, but the forecast said bad weather was coming. So Castiglioni
   explained to the group that he was changing their destination to
   Vignettes, which would shorten the day’s leg by about 2.5 hours.

   “The night before, I went to check the weather,” Piccioli said. “I
   talked with some people there, and they said a big wind was coming and
   it was serious. But then the day after started with quite beautiful
   weather.” The group strapped on backpacks loaded with spare clothes and
   gear, snacks, water, and small thermoses of hot tea, checked their
   bindings, and stepped off the hut’s stone terrace onto the snow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   They descended from Dix toward the southeast, crossed the Cheilon
   glacier, and started up the long four-to-five-hour ascent to the Pigne
   d’Arolla, a 12,454-foot peak that offers the highest elevation of the
   Haute Route and breathtaking panoramic views when the weather is good.
   From there, it’s typically a 30-to-60-minute downhill ski to the Cabane
   des Vignettes, which is cut into a stunning but exposed ridgeline at
   10,357 feet. Leaving at 6:30 a.m., the skiers should have been at the
   next hut in time for a late lunch. They never made it.

   The following morning, a small group of skiers leaving the Vignettes
   hut heard a cry for help from a rocky outcropping a little more than
   500 yards away. Within 15 minutes, a massive rescue was underway. But
   for most of the group, it was too late. Of the ten skiers, one was
   already dead, and six more would die of hypothermia within the next two
   days. Among the fatalities would be the guide and his wife.

   How could such an experienced group, with such an experienced guide,
   have gotten into such trouble? Because so many of the group died,
   including the guide himself, some of the answers will never be known.
   But there are enough pieces to reconstruct, at the very least, an
   important cautionary tale.

   The route from the Dix hut to the Cabane des Vignettes is “one big
   climb, and then one big descent,” according to Dale Remsberg, technical
   director of the American Mountain Guides Association. He has personally
   guided the Haute Route numerous times. “It’s also the point where you
   get to the highest elevation on the Haute Route, and it’s the leg
   that’s most exposed to weather.”

   From the Cheilon glacier, the ascent toward the Pigne d’Arolla is a
   steady uphill effort, including one section near the top that is
   steeper than the rest. The descent to the Vignettes hut, said Miles
   Smart, an American-trained guide who has worked in the Alps for 15
   years, “is actually quite straightforward in good weather. But if
   you’re there in bad weather, there are a few critical route-finding
   decisions to make. You don’t want to go the wrong way or you could
   potentially end up going off a cliff.”

   What makes the descent tricky, Remsberg explained, is that a couple
   thousand feet down the slope, you get to a point where “you have to
   find this little passageway through the rocks, which is marked by a big
   cairn, a big pile of rocks that people put there to kind of mark the
   spot. It’s only about 12 or 15 feet wide. So it’s a very, very small
   target to hit. And if you’ve got poor visibility, it’s a very, very
   difficult spot to find.” Once a skier finds that passageway, he said,
   “you ski below this icefall and right over to the hut.”

   As you approach that passageway, the hut is to the left, and, Remsberg
   said, “the fall line wants to take you left.” But if a skier were to
   follow the fall line, they would head right off the cliff. Again, none
   of that is too difficult to manage when the weather and visibility are
   good. But the conditions the doomed ski group found themselves battling
   were a very far cry from good. And the conditions deteriorated long
   before they reached this critical junction.

   For the first three hours of the day, the group proceeded uphill under
   partly cloudy skies. There was a little wind, but “nothing to worry
   about,” Piccioli remembered. By about 10 a.m., however, as they were
   getting pretty high up on the slopes, the conditions quickly began to
   worsen. The sky clouded over, the wind picked up, and the visibility
   dropped to near zero due to the fog and light snow. And yet the group
   continued to skin uphill toward the summit for another one to two
   hours.

   Castiglioni was navigating with the help of his smartphone, a common
   practice among Alpine guides. “On a trip like this, I’d say most guides
   are carrying a small Garmin GPS as a backup, but they’re primarily
   using their smartphone, because it works very well for navigation these
   days with apps like Gaia,” said Remsberg, referring to the GPS-based
   mobile app that offers preprogrammed hiking and touring maps.

   There is spotty cellphone coverage throughout most of the Haute Route,
   but reception isn’t necessary for the navigation apps to work, since
   they rely on GPS. Most guides, Remsberg said, actually switch their
   phones to airplane mode and turn off everything, except the navigation
   app if they need it, to save battery power. But the apps themselves use
   a lot of power, so most guides use a case with a built-in secondary
   battery and carry a larger backup battery that can recharge the phone
   several times. In addition, under normal circumstances, guides tend to
   take their phones out only periodically to check their group’s progress
   on a route and then put it away in a warm pocket, because cold
   temperatures degrade battery life.

   It’s unclear what precautions Castiglioni took with his phone or what
   kind of backup battery power he did or didn’t have. But at some point
   in that uphill section, it became clear that there was a problem with
   either his phone or navigation app.

   “We were in the whiteout, and he was going all over the place,”
   Piccioli said. “So, after some hesitation, I pulled out my GPS.”
   Whether because of the cold or wet snow, Piccioli’s cellphone––and, he
   thinks, everyone else’s cellphones, as well––had stopped working. But
   he was also carrying a waterproof Garmin eTrex GPS unit.

   “I could see we were heading the wrong way,” Piccioli said. “So I said
   to the guide, ‘Look, we have to go to the other side.’ And at first he
   said, ‘No, I know where to go.’ So I said, ‘Fine, let’s go where you
   want to go.’ But then he came back over and said, ‘Show me your GPS.’”

   The specific technical problems Castiglioni experienced remain a
   mystery. But one thing is clear: The device or battery or app failure
   was a critical factor in the tragedy. While Piccioli’s GPS continued to
   work faithfully throughout the rest of that day, he had loaded it only
   with the summer hiking version of the Haute Route. And while the summer
   and winter tracks on the Haute Route are similar, they’re not
   identical. “If the eTrex didn’t have the winter routes in it, really,
   all it would be good for would be pinpointing your position on the
   map,” Remsberg said. “You wouldn’t be able to find the route.”

   Nevertheless, Piccioli’s GPS was the best option the group had at that
   point. “Where we got lost, I saw a track on the map that ended at the
   Vignettes hut. So we decided to get to that and start following it,”
   Piccioli said.

   The group made it to the summit area of Pigne d’Arolla sometime between
   11:00 a.m and midday. But when they got to the summit saddle, the wind
   picked up and the weather got worse. It was so cold and the wind was so
   strong that they decided not to stop for lunch. Normally, it would have
   been a short ski down from the summit to the Vignettes hut. But because
   of the wind, snow, and limited visibility (about six feet at this
   point, according to Piccioli), Castiglioni opted instead to have the
   group take off their skis, put crampons on their ski boots, and hike
   down.

   “If the weather was bad enough, a guide might decide that it doesn’t
   make sense to be on skis, because everybody can get away from each
   other a little too quickly,” Remsberg acknowledged. “That might be a
   technique a guide would use to control the group and minimize risk, for
   sure.”

   When the whiteout began, a group of four French ski tourers who had
   been self-navigating on the same leg joined up with the group because
   they, too, were having trouble finding their way. That meant the group
   hiking down from the Pigne d’Arolla summit now consisted of 14 people:
   Piccioli, trying to follow the summer Haute Route track on his GPS,
   followed by Castiglioni and the 12 other skiers. The group did not rope
   up, but Piccioli said Castiglioni did tie a rope around his waist and
   let the end of it drag in the snow behind him so the skiers would have
   a track to follow, even if they couldn’t see him.

   Even if the group had been following the winter ski route, a GPS in
   whiteout conditions can’t warn of hazards like crevasses or drop-offs.
   The increasingly intense storm added to the already considerable risk
   factor. As the skiers slowly wound their way down from the summit, the
   wind gusts began reaching speeds above 50 miles per hour, the
   temperature dropped, and the snow fell harder. “The wind was so strong,
   it would not let us fall,” Piccioli said. “We couldn’t take off our
   gloves, because our hands would have frozen, and we probably couldn’t
   have put them on again.”

   The group couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead of them. Trying to
   navigate the summer route in the snow got them lost several more times.
   What should have been a 60-minute journey stretched into an endurance
   marathon that lasted throughout the afternoon. Late in the day, a
   thunderstorm struck the mountain, intensifying the snow and wind.

   The hours of fighting their way forward, retracing step after step,
   against howling winds, cold, and snow, without food or drink, drained
   the group’s strength as afternoon gave way to evening. And yet they
   pushed on, doggedly trying to find the hut.

   With hindsight, it seems amazing that a group of experienced skiers
   would have continued on for so many hours, in a complete whiteout and
   in worsening wind and snow, instead of turning around or trying to call
   for rescue. It is, in fact, something Piccioli himself now questions.
   But, he explained, once the group started the descent toward the
   Vignettes hut––which is also when the conditions began to get really
   bad––going forward seemed the best possible option.

   “We were all convinced that the hut was close,” Piccioli explained.
   “And it was, because you could see, on my GPS, that it was quite close.
   So we said, ‘All right. We’re going to be seeing it very soon.’” But
   what the clients in Castiglioni’s group didn’t know was how tricky the
   navigation was between their location and the hut. Due to the snow,
   wind, and minimal visibility, they never found the stone cairn or the
   passageway to the last downhill. Instead, they wandered in vain above
   it, becoming weaker and weaker until, at around 8 p.m., night fell.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Castiglioni told the group they had to stop. It was too dangerous to
   keep going in the dark. He pulled out a satellite phone and tried to
   call for help. But, according to Piccioli, the phone’s battery was
   dead.

   At that point, the group had no alternative except to try to dig in for
   the night. But the place where they’d stopped was a rocky outcropping.
   To make things worse, they were on a south-facing slope, and the wind,
   which was now near hurricane force, was coming from the south. “I dug a
   little hole behind a rock, but there was no way to dig a real shelter,
   because there was no snow in there,” Piccioli explained. “It was a
   saddle. The wind was roaring very, very strong. So it had blown all the
   snow away.” Everyone in the group had Mylar space blankets in their
   packs, but, as Piccioli said, “They were completely useless because of
   the wind. So I didn’t even take mine out, because as soon as you took
   it out, it would blow away.”

   The situation at that point had become dire. The temperature was
   dropping, and the group had very little left in the way of physical or
   mental reserves. Piccioli and Castiglioni put Francesca, Elisabetta,
   and Gabriella in the small space Piccioli had dug, even though it
   wasn’t really big enough to shelter them from the wind. The four French
   skiers went to find or dig shelter of their own, as did Castiglioni’s
   wife. Piccioli and the German woman found niches in the rocks near the
   other women. Gabriella’s husband, Marcello, the Swiss man, and
   Castiglioni huddled down in the best shelter they could find nearby.

   Everyone in the group was nearing the point of collapse. Piccioli
   started out trying to stand to keep himself moving and awake, but the
   effort was too much. So he sat against a rock, trying to minimize the
   amount of his body area in contact with the snow. He knew from
   mountaineering courses and books he’d read, that in order to survive,
   he had to stay awake and moving. “Not great movements. Little
   movements, just enough to keep your heart beating, and just a little
   bit your body,” he explained. “And also not to fall asleep, because
   that’s dangerous, to fall asleep. Then the hypothermia catches you and
   you’re gone. So I said to myself, ‘In the next eight to ten hours, I
   have to move. I just can’t go to sleep.’”

   Late in the night, Piccioli checked on the three women in the hole he’d
   dug and saw they were doing poorly. “When that terrible night started,
   I thought Gabriella might die,” Piccioli recalled. “She was pretty
   weak. But honestly, I didn’t think that anyone else, apart from her,
   was going to die.”

   By the time he checked on them, however, all three women were in
   trouble. “They were dying,” Piccioli said. So he went over to
   Castiglioni and suggested that the guide go and see if his wife had
   found a better shelter. If she had, he said, the two of them could go
   with their shovels and dig a bigger hole and move the women there.

   “But he said to me, ‘Look, I can’t see anything,’” Piccioli recalled.
   “He said his eyes had been damaged by the blizzard. By the wind. He was
   blind. He couldn’t see anything. That’s what he told me.” A few hours
   later, Piccioli said, he saw Castiglioni sitting with his backpack
   strapped on his back. That was the last time he saw or heard from the
   guide. When rescuers arrived in the morning, they found his body at the
   bottom of the steep slope below the outcropping where the group had
   stopped.

   Piccioli returned to his shelter and focused on trying to keep himself
   alive. The temperatures were below freezing, the wind was approaching
   60 miles per hour, and the snow was driving into him. “At that point,”
   he explained, “you pretty much have to think for yourself. Because your
   forces are very low. You don’t have great capability, in terms of
   thinking. I knew I had to keep moving. But at least two or three times,
   I thought, ‘What’s the point? It’s too hard. Just let go.’”

   What kept him from giving in? Piccioli paused, remembering. “You know,
   at that stage, you don’t really think about you. It’s strange, but at
   the real end, you think about others. I thought about my wife, and my
   mom, and I said, ‘I can’t do that to them. I’d like to, but I can’t.’
   And that’s what saved me.”

   Around dawn, the wind and storm finally abated. Piccioli had kept his
   eyes closed against the wind. But when he opened them, the sky was
   overcast and there was decent visibility. He stood up and went to check
   on his friends. The German woman was alive, sitting near him.
   Several of the others were unconscious. “It was really bad,” Piccioli
   recalled. “All the people were lying on their chests and covered by
   snow.”

   He looked across the valley and saw the Vignettes hut. But he also
   realized it wasn’t all that close, in terms of actually skiing there.
   Unsure of what to do next, Piccioli dug into his pack and got his
   thermos of tea, which he shared with the German woman. Neither of them
   had anything to eat or drink for almost 24 hours and were at the end of
   their endurance.

   While they were drinking the tea, the German woman suddenly spotted
   skiers below them. “So I stood up,” Piccioli said, “and I shouted out,
   ‘Help! Help! Help!’ And the skiers stopped. They gathered together, and
   I could see they heard me. And then, after 15 minutes, the helicopter
   came.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   The weekend of that storm, a total of 16 people died in the Alps.
   Besides the seven who died near the Vignettes hut, two Swiss climbers,
   ages 21 and 22, got caught out in the storm and died of hypothermia in
   the Bernese region, as did a Russian woman snowshoeing on Monte Rosa in
   Italy. Two Frenchmen, a climber and mountaineer, were killed in
   separate avalanches, one near Mont Blanc, in France, and the other in
   Switzerland’s Valais Canton. Four others died in falls. Enrico
   Frescura, 30, and Alessandro Marengon, 28, both volunteers from the
   Dolomite Mountain Rescue in Italy, slipped on the final stage of an
   ascent on Monte Antelao in Italy. Two other skiers died in separate
   instances after tumbling into crevasses.

   Accidents or events that result in multiple deaths are hardly unknown
   in the Alps. In 1970, a total of 113 people were killed in an avalanche
   and a landslide, just two months apart. In 1999, 12 people died in an
   avalanche near Chamonix. In 2008, eight more people were killed in a
   single avalanche on Mont Blanc. In 2015, two separate avalanches took
   the lives of 12 skiers and seven climbers, respectively, in the span of
   only five and a half months. But group fatalities from hypothermia,
   frostbite, or exposure are rarer. And what makes the Pigne d’Arolla
   accident particularly perplexing and tragic is that it really shouldn’t
   have happened.

   Anjan Truffer, head of mountain rescue for Air Zermatt, the company
   that worked with Air Glacier to rescue the group near the Vignettes
   hut, using seven helicopters, said that although his company performs
   between 180 to 200 high-altitude rescues each year, “it’s not common”
   for such an accident to happen on the Haute Route. “Those tracks are
   well traveled, and normally there are a lot of guides on those trails,”
   Truffer said. “Technically, it’s not a very, very difficult thing to
   do.”

   What’s more, although the storm that hit the Alps that weekend was
   severe, it was not sudden or unexpected. Miles Smart was guiding a ski
   touring group along the same Haute Route track that Castiglioni’s group
   was following, just 24 hours ahead of them. On the morning of April 29,
   Smart and his clients were in the Vignettes hut. “We were in a weather
   pattern known as the Foehn wind,” he explained, “which is a south-wind
   weather phenomenon on the main alpine ride of the Alps. And it’s
   especially strong, normally, from the Pigne d’Arolla to Zermatt. So we
   were watching that all week. And we were pretty confident that we
   weren’t going to be able to do anything high up that day.”

   When Smart and his group woke up on the morning the storm hit, the
   actual conditions at the Vignettes hut were as bad, if not worse than
   the forecast had predicted. “It was very, very windy,” he said. “And
   poor visibility all around. There were probably about five or six
   guided groups in the hut that morning. Among all of us
   professionals––American guides, Swiss guides––there didn’t even need to
   be a conversation. Everybody was on the same page. Instead of trying to
   go on to Zermatt, we chose to just descend down. There’s quite an easy
   route from the Vignettes hut to the village of Arolla. We left at about
   7 a.m., and we were down about 45 minutes later.”

   Even that early, however, the winds were strong enough that the guides
   had to help each individual client safely navigate the short distance
   from the hut to a spot on the leeward side of the ridge where they
   could put on their skis and start the descent. So even as Castiglioni’s
   group was preparing to leave the Dix hut, the storm was already “full
   on,” in Smart’s words, at the Vignettes. Beyond the fact that the
   weather forecasts Smart had been following all week would have been
   available to any guide, the huts are also connected by telephone. So a
   simple call before the group departed Dix would have revealed how bad
   the weather already was at their destination.

   In addition to obtaining that weather information, it would have been
   common, although not required, for a guide to call ahead if a group was
   planning to divert from its planned itinerary (in Castiglioni’s case,
   from Nacamuli to the Vignettes hut) to make sure there was room for the
   group at the alternate destination. But Piccioli says the provincial
   police investigating the accident told him that the guardians at
   Vignettes never received a phone call asking about the weather or
   alerting them that the group was coming. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine
   the group setting out if Castiglioni had talked to anyone at the
   Vignettes hut.

   There were also alternatives to the high route the group took over the
   Pigne d’Arolla summit. From the Dix hut, it’s possible to descend and
   follow a low route on the north side of the mountain, near the village
   of Arolla, and either overnight in the village or skin up the same
   slope to the Cabane des Vignettes that Smart’s group skied down.
   Another choice, according to Smart, would have been to set out and see
   how the conditions were, and then turn around if the weather started to
   get bad.

   It's also a mystery why Castiglioni at least appeared to have had only
   a single cellphone for navigation. “I think it is quite a deadly thing
   to do to rely simply on the cellphone,” Truffer said, “They run out of
   battery life so fast when it’s cold and windy. You should have an
   actual, proper GPS.” Again, some guides do rely primarily on
   smartphones for navigation, but, as Remsberg noted, they also usually
   make sure they have some kind of redundancy in capability.

   Given the various alternatives available to the group, and the fact
   that the storm was not only predicted but already in force at Vignettes
   early that morning––information that was readily available at the Dix
   hut––Remsberg agreed that, at best, “it is hard to understand” how
   Castiglioni made the decisions he did that day. At the same time, it’s
   perplexing that a group of experienced skiers never questioned those
   decisions and kept following their guide blindly into the storm.

   Nobody will ever know exactly what was going through the minds of the
   people who died. But how decisions like that manage to get made is
   something the American Mountain Guides Association, which trains and
   certifies professional guides in the United States, and the IFMGA, its
   European equivalent, have been paying more attention to in recent
   years. And several factors undoubtedly played into the tragic equation
   on the Pigne d’Arolla.

   “We focus a lot on [human factors] in American guiding, more than we
   used to,” Remsberg said, especially heuristic assumptions, or mental
   traps, that both guides and clients can fall into. One of the biggest
   traps that influences accidents in the Alps, he said, is that of
   complacency, because of the fast access and the amazing hut system.
   “It’s easy to feel more protected because of the infrastructure,”
   Remsberg explained. “You can get to the terrain easier in the Alps, so
   therefore it seems safer.” It’s not, of course. More than 150 people
   die in the Alps every year. But that illusion has numerous
   consequences. One of them is that European clients and guides alike can
   think they don’t need as much information or equipment redundancy to be
   safe.

   “It’s not that [Europeans] don’t want information. It’s that the
   mountain culture in Europe and the support infrastructure in the Alps
   create an environment that makes them feel they don’t need as much of
   it,” Remsberg said. In the United States, by contrast, guides and
   clients have to be more self-sufficient, carrying not only tents,
   rescue tarps, and supplies, but also more survival, communication, and
   navigation equipment. As a result, U.S. guides also tend to be better
   at or focus more on communication with their clients, from sharing
   maps, weather, and navigation plans to hazards and the reasons behind
   go and no-go decisions. “American guides are definitely into giving a
   lot of briefing, in general,” Smart acknowledged. “It’s something we’re
   known for.”

   Obviously, individual guides will differ in how well they communicate
   with their clients. But one of the reasons Piccioli says his group
   didn’t question the decisions that day was because they didn’t have any
   idea what the plan was or where their route was going to take them.
   “There was very little talk and no briefing at all from the guide,”
   Piccioli said. “And I think, on a trip like this, you should inform
   your group where we’re going, what we’re doing, exactly. If I’d known
   about the narrow passage we had to find to get to the hut, I would have
   said, ‘No way we’re going on.’”

   Complacency can also influence a guide’s preparation and
   decision-making. It could be that, compared to some of the bigger
   expeditions Castiglioni had been a part of, the relative “ease” of the
   Haute Route lured him into bringing less redundant navigation and
   communication equipment, as well as pressing on even when the weather
   deteriorated. Certainly Piccioli acknowledges that he and his friends
   “underrated the gravity of the situation.”

   The group also seems to have fallen into a trap known as the expert
   halo. On their own, the eight skiers were all experienced enough to
   check weather, research the route, and question the decision to set out
   in the first place. But because they’d hired an expert guide, they
   surrendered their decision-making to his. “We just did the trip, not
   planning. He was supposed to plan,” Piccioli said. “And this probably
   was a weakness from us. When you self-organize, you really care about
   things like maps and weather. But once you have a guide…,” his voice
   trailed off, and he sighed. “Nobody said anything because, probably,
   they all trusted him. Including me. They all trusted him and said, ‘OK,
   we’re just following him.’”

   That is perhaps the biggest takeaway from the tragedy. “If I have
   something wrong and go to the doctor, I don’t just blindly trust that
   they’re making all the right decisions,” Remsberg said. “And I think
   people should approach the mountains that way, even if they’re hiring a
   guide to take them out. I would encourage people not to blindly hand
   over all responsibility to the guide, but to be a team member in the
   setting and approach it that way.”

   For Piccioli, however, the answer is simpler. From now on, he says,
   he’s going to make sure he’s in charge of all the planning, equipment,
   and decision-making in any future adventures. “I’m sure there are a lot
   of great guides out there,” he said. “But I’m going to do the
   organizing myself.”

I Was Flying to Montana to Bury My Son

   On a plane ride over the Mountain West, a grieving father retraces his
   adventurous youth and searches for solace in the rugged landscapes that
   molded him

   We lifted off from Albuquerque, New Mexico, on a warm spring morning,
   rising out of the concrete grid, over the brown river flanked by
   cottonwoods leafing out in green, then north above a range of barren
   mounds and sandy arroyos dotted with piñon.

   Somewhere down below, my wife rode north toward Montana in the back
   seat of her parents’ car, cradling the body of our boy. Our only child.
   She and I had bought tickets to sit together on this plane. She had
   just given birth and could not be expected to sit two days in a car as
   it brought the casket and the child to the woods near the Canadian
   border where she was raised, a better resting place than the weedy
   brown graveyards of Albuquerque, a city in which we didn’t expect to
   stay long. We wanted our boy at home.

   But as the departure day approached, C. realized that we had bought the
   ticket for Mother’s Day, and she couldn’t bear the thought of spending
   it away from him. I couldn’t bear the thought of two days confined to
   the car with his embalmed body. As a result, I flew alone, taking a
   window seat over the dry mountains. Our first decision as parents was
   what to do with his body. Although I still hadn’t changed a diaper, I
   had changed his ice packs. I was 47 years old.
