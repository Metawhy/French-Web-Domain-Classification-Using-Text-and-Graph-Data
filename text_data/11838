  What fantastic experience to cycle round Barcelona - thanks to Rachel

   This was a wonderful experience - Rachel was so knowledgable, friendly
   and professional - she is a real asset to this company. She knew
   everything about the city and whatever question she was asked she was
   happy to provide an answer. She went above and beyond her duty - we had
   a longer session as she didn't have another group to follow ours. It
   was so good that we only had a small group as well - easy to follow
   Rachel along the cycle paths and plenty of time to stop and take
   photos. I'd recomend this as the best thing to do in Barcelona - we
   will definitely be looking to cycle around other cities in Europe -
   it's the only way to see the best of the city!xx

  Very friendly staff giving a very good organised tour with care.

   Your staff was very friendly, informative and clear in giving
   instructions. They took great care in making sure everyone understood
   where they needed to be when. Kept on warning us about safety issues
   that was a great help. As a tourist you can easily get caught up in the
   moment and not pay attention to those around you. Bus was very clean
   and comfortable. Will use your services again soon and recommend it to
   those I know. Thank you for a great tour!

  Too often you don't get what you paid for.

   Casa Battlo wasn't the only ticket we booked. It happens too often that
   after having booked and paid for a ticket one gets a message the trip
   is not available on the date that was booked, it is cancelled
   completely or the time that the voucher shows is not what you booked.
   Also we had a lot of trouble showing the voucher on the phone since
   downloading wouldn't work at the destination chosen. I doubt if I would
   book with you again.

  The building is beautiful but too crowded

   In general, I liked Caso Batlló. Gaudi's genius knowledge and
   creativity gave marvelous results that bewilder visitors from all
   around the world. It's absolutely astonishing - the play of light and
   shadow, the glasswork, and the texture of the materials used. The audio
   guide was really useful and helped to understand the creation. The only
   irritating factor was the number of tourists:)

  Monsterrat was fantastic exceeded all my expectations

   Monsterrat was amazing ! Beautiful scenery , church interesting history
   ! The tour to Sagrada Família was very interesting but lots of standing
   , which after the Monsterrat tour was tiring ! Better to do them
   separately ! Tour guides were great very knowledgeable

The best Barcelona players of all time

   With a capacity of almost 100,000, Camp Nou is the largest stadium in
   Europe and home to Barcelona's soccer powerhouse, FC Barcelona. Before
   booking your tour of the famous grounds, here's a quick rundown of the
   greatest talents to have called it home.
   Johann Cruyff Johann Cruyff

Johann Cruyff

   The Dutch legend chose Barça over Real Madrid because of the latter's
   association with Francisco Franco. His signing quashed Real's almost
   complete dominance of the Spanish game.
   László Kubala László Kubala
   Photo: Nationaal Archief (CC BY-SA 3.0 NL)

László Kubala

   These days he's hardly a household name, but Kubala netted an
   impressive 274 goals in 345 matches. Fun fact: He played for three
   national teams: Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Spain!
   Xavi Hernandez Xavi Hernandez

Xavi Hernandez

   Xavi is close to retirement, having spent an entire career in control
   of Barcelona's midfield, filling the boots of the unshakable Pep
   Guardiola.
   Ronaldinho Ronaldinho

Ronaldinho

   Barça fans were happy to see the Brazilian leave after an injury-prone
   season in 2007/2008, but prior to that, he'd been regularly producing
   the kind of goals that schoolboys dream of.
   Lionel Messi Lionel Messi

Lionel Messi

   The club's record scorer is the world's greatest player, with a cool
   temper, cunning, and the natural righteousness that is lacking in
   Real's more cynical Ronaldo.

Our insider tips

How to get there?

   Camp Nou can be reached on the Metro via Line 3 (get off at Palau Reial
   or Les Corts) and Line 5 (Collblanc or Badal). The stadium can be
   entered by car via Access 14, and if you're just going for a tour,
   parking is free during Camp Nou Experience hours.

How to pronounce Camp Nou?

   If your cab-driver doesn't understand "the Noo Camp" (as it's commonly
   pronounced in English), try saying it properly and in the right order
   instead! Camp Nou simply means "the new field," and the Nou is
   pronounced as more of a "No." It might also help if you call soccer
   "football."

Buying Barcelona tickets

   Tickets for big games like Barcelona vs Real Madrid get snapped up
   fast. If you're chasing them at short notice, prepare to sell a vital
   organ or two! Your best bet is always to buy online before your trip,
   but with so many seats available, less important games ought to be a
   lot easier to plan spontaneously.

Good to know

     *

        When should I visit?
                It is advised you arrive before 11:00AM or from 4:00PM.
                Check the FC Barcelona website before your planned visit,
                as spontaneous changes are possible due to the stadium
                being in use.

     *

        Is it expensive?
                General admission is €23.

     *

        Will I need a guide?
                It will definitely help. It's worth checking out these
                best-selling tours.

     *

        How to get there
                Metro lines 3 (get off at Palau Reial) and 5 (get off at
                Collblanc) are near the stadium. If you are driving, you
                can get to the car park through Access 14 from Carrer
                Aristides Maillol.

     *

        Additional information
                *Once you have purchased your ticket, you do not need to
                wait for a specific day to use it - it's valid until
                December 31st of that year.
                *If you are visiting in the morning, get there before
                11:00AM.

What people are saying about Camp Nou

   Overall rating
   4.2 / 5
   based on 696 reviews

  Excellent for football fans. Very impressive stadium

   As a group we enjoyed this tour and you cannot fail to be impressed by
   the stadium and the success of the club. Having been on other stadium
   tours in Europe where you were given a guided tour I felt this was very
   much a money making machine and whilst I appreciate that a guided tour
   was not possible due to the numbers visiting I felt audio guides should
   have been offered at no extra cost. Having said that for football fans
   it is a great experience and my son loved it.

  Plenty to see,really interesting & thoroughly enjoyed.

   Found the tour full of information & interesting,was layout well aswell
   Facilities & food area were good,really enjoyed. Just would have been
   nice to have known we had to pay extra for the audio information as i
   bought this as a gift for my friend,also a souvenir as a keepsake,maybe
   a ticket,wristband ect, would have been nice as bought the tickets as a
   present & not just something I had to purchase in the shop as my ticket
   was just a paper print out.

  Such a good atmosphere must be amazing on match days

   Went with my husband who loves football but I found the tour amazing
   ,learning how Barcelona FC has grown over the years and could feel the
   passion of the of the players and the Catalan people who support the
   club. Thought we would be there about 2 hours and stayed nearly 3 and
   half hours. A must visit when you"re in Barcelona

  Great history, but not much value for money

   History of FCB could not be glorified any further. Very well detailed.
   Fun photoshoots plus some games in between the tour, experience of
   stadium is something indescribable when you are a football fan. Simple
   food and a drink of your choice. Worth the money, I don't think so.

   It was very inspiring to read about all the soccer players, their

   stadium chairs, watching on huge screens the various world cup

What people are saying about Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya

   Overall rating
   4.4 / 5
   based on 1,131 reviews

  Amazing!! Absolutely made our short trip a maximum experience!!

   We were able to get our voucher printed at the Sant train station
   Information desk where they also then gave us our passports and got us
   on our way. We didn’t see that as a possibility in the information we
   were emailed, so it felt like a lucky find. Made things very easy. We
   only were able to utilize two days, as that was the duration of our
   stay (actually, just 1-1/2 days). But, even at that, it more than
   easily paid for itself. We saw several museums (Picasso, Dissemy, Míro,
   etc.) and sights (Parc Guell, Sagrada Família, etc.) and were able to
   traverse the entire city quickly and easily via the included bus and
   metro.

  Museum was great but the staff were not that helpful

   Everything in the museum was great. I loved the exhibitions about Gala
   and Salvador Dali. The museum was not too crowded so you could walk
   around freely. The only negative thing I have to say is about one of
   the receptionists. I showed her my ticket and told me that I need to go
   to the other desk and dismissed me just like that and moved on to the
   next customer. Not even friendly at all. She never mentioned where the
   other desk was so I just felt lost for a moment.

  Great tour, but missing a few technical infos.

   The guide Antonio was great. He really knew a lot of thing and we
   always got an answer if needed to our questions. The minus thing is
   that he asked us to come with him at the end of the tour outside of the
   gate to give back your earphones...but only then did he told us we
   could have stayed inside to walk some more inside the gardens, but it
   was too late once we cross the exit gates.

  The travel card was good and recommended

   The pass I think depends on how long you will be there - I am not
   convinced that was value for money as quite a lot of the activities
   were not free - you only received a discount - and the ones that were
   free were relatively inexpensive and you could purchase easily at the
   time with no great expense. The travel card was good and made life easy
   for getting around the city

  The 5 days Card was an exeptionally good and useful pillar of our stay

   all in all, we used the card at least more than a dozen places, and - I
   dare say -without this card we didn't watch as many places as we had
   with it…

Things to do in Barri Gòtic

   Founded by the Romans circa 133BC, "El Barri Gòtic" has been the
   historic and cultural heart of Barcelona ever since. More than just a
   hub for tourism, the Gothic Quarter has a little something for
   everyone. Here are a few tips before booking your tour!
   Eating Eating

Eating

   The quarter boasts some of Barcelona's best restaurants – and its
   oldest, Can Culleretes! Try Bar Pinotxo's top-class tapas or the
   traditional curios saved from extinction at Agut.
   Shopping Shopping

Shopping

   The Gothic Quarter's shops and boutiques make spending money just a
   little too easy! Check out L'Arca de l'Àvia's antique homeware and the
   Catholic candy (yes, really!) at Caelum.
   Sightseeing Sightseeing

Sightseeing

   El Barri Gòtic's narrow streets are rich with history, from Barcelona
   Cathedral and the old Jewish quarter to La Rambla and Passeig de Gràcia
   – home to several of Gaudí's works!

Learning

   Culture vultures will find plenty to stir the imagination at the
   quarter's museums. Highlights include the Barcelona City History Museum
   and the eccentric Museu Frederic Marès.
   Drinking and Dancing Drinking and Dancing

Drinking and Dancing

   Despite its age, the area is no stranger to Barcelona's favorite
   cocktail! Check out Jamboree's Latin and jazz jams or catch Indie rock
   acts at Sidecar Factory Club.

Our insider tips

When to visit?

   Barri Gòtic is one of Barcelona's busiest districts, so it might be
   best to avoid the tourist season if you can! Visiting in May or June
   will see shorter queues and better hotel availability without
   sacrificing the glorious weather.

Is it safe?

   Like La Rambla, Barcelona's Gothic Quarter is a haven for pickpockets
   targeting tourists. Always keep your valuables out of sight and never
   leave your belongings unattended. Violent crime is not much of a
   concern, but if out sampling the area's nightlife – as with anywhere –
   it can't hurt to stick to populated, well-lit streets!

        When should I visit?
                The Quarter is always open for a stroll and some people
                watching!

     *

        Is it expensive?
                It's free to take in the views, but it'll be easy to spend
                money on food, souvenirs and entertainment!

        Will I need a guide?
                Why not? Might be worth it to check out these best-selling
                tours.

        How to get there
                This area is within walking distance from the old town and
                city center!

  What fantastic experience to cycle round Barcelona - thanks to Rachel

   This was a wonderful experience - Rachel was so knowledgable, friendly
   and professional - she is a real asset to this company. She knew
   everything about the city and whatever question she was asked she was
   happy to provide an answer. She went above and beyond her duty - we had
   a longer session as she didn't have another group to follow ours. It
   was so good that we only had a small group as well - easy to follow
   Rachel along the cycle paths and plenty of time to stop and take
   photos. I'd recomend this as the best thing to do in Barcelona - we
   will definitely be looking to cycle around other cities in Europe -
   it's the only way to see the best of the city!xx

  Absolutely brilliant - if you do one thing in Barcelona, this is it

   We had an absolutely brilliant time, we'd seen people taking the tour
   and thought it might be more interesting than the bus tour, so thought
   we'd try it, and it was the best decision of our trip. Amazing
   experience to ride through the streets of Barcelona and along by the
   sea. It's a great city for cyclists and even as someone who'd not
   cycled in 15 years, it was easy to get used to and great fun. Would
   100% recommend.

  Our tour guide gave us an almost two hour walking tour!

   I would highly recommend this tour. Excellent English, very
   knowledgeable about Picasso, Picasso’s neighborhood as well as the
   history if Barcelona from it’s origin, Napoleon times, bombing during
   WWII, etc! Truly informative , educational and very interesting. And
   then our tour guide took us into the Picasso museum and shared details
   about his paintings and other art. Amazing and would highly recommemd!

  Fun way to see Barcelona, would highly recommend

   We were a group of 15 on a family holiday. Eva and Marco were fantastic
   guides going out of there way to accommodate such a large group. They
   made the experience fun and informative. We learnt and saw a lot of the
   city. I would highly recommend them for ease of use of website to email
   communication. Give it a go you really won’t be disappointed

  Remarkable stories in extraordinary architecture

   This experience was the best decision we made while we were in
   Barcelona. The tour of Palau was terrific, and the untold stories of
   the relationship between Gaudi and Lluís Domènech were very amusing.
   Strongly recommend!
