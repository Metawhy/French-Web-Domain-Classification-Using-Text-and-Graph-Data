KEY TERMS

   Prior to learning about Sojern’s privacy practices, it may be helpful
   to familiarize yourself with some of the key terminology we use when
   describing the technology and processes surrounding the Sojern
   Platform. We’ve prepared a helpful guide for you to review here.

SOJERN PLATFORM OVERVIEW

   Sojern’s traveler audience engagement platform (the “Platform”) ingests
   intent signals and filters this data to build out traveler profiles
   (“Traveler Profiles”). We obtain these intent signals from our various
   data partners (“Data Partners”) and advertising clients (“Clients”). We
   then use this data to help our Clients build advertisements for their
   end users who visit their websites or mobile applications (“End Users”)
   and advertise to them through major advertising exchanges and
   publishers worldwide. The Platform allows our Clients to deliver
   relevant advertisements to individual end users, by displaying products
   that our Client’s end user might be interested in based on their recent
   browsing behavior or mobile application behavior, including delivering
   advertisements across a user’s different devices. For example, if you
   visit and browse on either a website or a mobile application through a
   Sojern Platform Data Partner, you may see personalized ads based on
   your prior browsing history on another website or mobile application.
   Click here for more information about ‘Interest-Based Advertising’.

   Sojern acts as a service provider on behalf of our Clients who purchase
   our products and services for their use. We do not have a direct
   relationship with consumers or other end users, as we work in
   coordination with advertising delivery platforms and advertisers to
   help facilitate targeted advertisements. This Privacy Policy describes
   our collection and use of various types of information we utilize on
   behalf of these Clients and Data Partners to assist them in their
   disclosure obligations to their End Users on the Client’s or Data
   Partner’s websites or mobile applications, as applicable.

TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

   Sojern Products do not intentionally collect any information from End
   Users that would personally identify you in the real-world, such as
   name, address, email address, or phone number. However, as various
   global laws define personal information differently, Sojern will comply
   with the respective laws of the location in which the data is
   collected. We (or service providers on our behalf) collect the
   following data from End Users to be used in our various advertising
   related products: (1) website visitor data (including mobile websites)
   collected via placement by our Clients or Data Partners of Sojern
   pixels on their respective websites, (2) mobile application data
   through select Data Partners who enable such information sharing, (3)
   location-based information, (4) cross-device data, which brings
   together the various data points, as described more fully below, and
   (5) information received from Third Party sources.

   Website (& Mobile Website) Visitor Data Collection

   Through the implementation of Sojern pixels that our Clients or Data
   Partners place on their websites (including mobile websites), Sojern
   collects certain information about our Client’s End Users’ actions on
   that website and places a cookie on the End User’s browser or device.
   The type of information collected through the placement of the pixel
   includes commonly associated information from your device or Internet
   access, as well as attributes that are unique to our Data Partners.

   Information commonly associated with website visitors includes: IP
   address, browser type, browser version, Operating System (OS), OS
   version, HTTP referrer, event time and event type. We may also use
   Third Party tools to infer additional data such as proximate location
   information from an IP address.

   Unique attributes, which we often refer to as ‘intent signals’, may
   include specific web pages visited, travel search requests with
   specified search entry variables, and travel search booking results.
   These variables and results include many of the fields you enter in a
   travel search request, such as the type of travel, dates, locations,
   properties, numbers of guests, number of rooms, amenities, and other
   interests. If a travel loyalty ID number (e.g., frequent flier number)
   is entered and passed through during a booking, Sojern will randomize
   this information to prevent either Sojern or our travel partner(s) from
   being able to connect it back to a known person.

   Mobile Application Data

   We also receive, but do not directly collect, certain mobile device and
   application data through Third Party service providers, including
   Mobile Attribution Vendors that our Clients or Data Partners may
   contract with to work with Sojern. These Third Parties, including the
   Mobile Attribution Vendors, are solely responsible for compliance with
   the terms of the contracts with the Data Partners or Clients, their
   respective privacy policies, guidelines or rules set forth by the
   Mobile Attribution Vendors, including, without limitation, any limits
   on what data they can pass to Third Parties, such as, Sojern.

   The types of mobile device and application data that we receive via
   these Mobile Attribution Vendors includes intent signals as well as
   device-specific attributes including mobile device type, mobile device
   brand, mobile device model, phone carrier, mobile device language,
   Operating System (OS), OS version, Advertising ID (Apple IDFA or Google
   Advertising ID), IP address, Wi-Fi status, GPS, and other attributes.

   Location-Based Information

   As noted, Sojern Products may receive various data attributes that may
   infer or identify your location. These location data attributes may
   include geographic information you enter in a travel search request or
   transaction, as well as from your IP address, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or
   mobile device GPS. See below in the ‘Your Choices’ section for more
   information on restricting access to this type of information.

   Cross-Device Collection

   In order to facilitate the most relevant ads possible, Sojern works
   with various service providers who assist with delivering similar ads
   to end users across devices including computers, tablets, and mobile
   phones. These service providers may attempt to synchronize the IDs
   Sojern receives with IDs collected from other data partners. For
   example, if you see an ad that Sojern helped facilitate on your
   computer web browser, you may see a similar ad on a mobile website or
   mobile application facilitated through our cross-device synchronization
   process. See below for more information on how we use this information
   and your choices for continued tracking.

   Information Received from Third Party Sources

   In addition to data collected through our Data Partners and Clients,
   Sojern may work with various third parties to supplement or append data
   to our Products. This may include unique user data that is synchronized
   with third party data providers, inferred data based on
   interest-categories, or aggregated information. Examples of appended
   information may include demographics such as gender, age, marital
   status, regional census data, and income or psychographics such as
   lifestyle interests. In any case, Sojern does not intentionally append
   or synchronize any information that would personally identify you in
   the real world. However, as various global laws define personal
   information differently, Sojern will comply with the respective laws of
   the location in which the data is collected.

   Please note that Sojern does not intentionally collect or receive any
   information that may be deemed ‘sensitive’ such as protected health
   information or credit-worthiness.

   Information Collected From Clients

   Sojern collects data from its Clients in order to communicate and
   provide services. This may include name, physical address, email
   address, mobile device advertising ID, and IP address. In addition,
   Sojern collects third-party information from its Clients through Sojern
   Products. For instance, a Client may provide us with another person’s
   information in order add them as a user to the system. Sojern will only
   use the information collected from Clients for the purposes detailed in
   this policy and in accordance with the terms of the applicable
   agreement(s).

HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

   Sojern’s Products use data for three distinct purposes. The first is
   ingesting intent signals from across our Data Partners and Clients to
   create unique traveler profiles across web and mobile experiences. The
   second is utilizing a proprietary learning algorithm to combine data
   from advertising campaigns and ID synchronization efforts to create the
   most relevant campaign opportunities. Finally, the data is used to
   enable our advertiser clients to utilize the Sojern Platform with
   real-time advertising campaigns.

   Creation of Traveler Profiles

   Like most advertising services, we use a combination of pixel tags and
   cookies to recognize your preferences and effectively administer our
   Service. A pixel tag is a small image placed on a website to track
   visitor activity including when advertisements are delivered or
   clicked-on. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies. A
   cookie is a small text file containing a string of characters that is
   placed on your browser or device by a host when you visit a website.
   When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that host to
   recognize your browser.

   We assign a unique randomized Sojern profile cookie ID to each user
   (“Sojern Profile ID”). The Sojern Profile ID is a unique technical ID
   that we assign to users that we see across the web — i.e. a unique
   cookie sighting. Any time we see the same Sojern Profile ID, we append
   any data collected on that visitor to their Sojern Profile for future
   reference. For example, if you search for a hotel in a certain city
   through a travel search Data Partner, and then visit a specific hotel
   website that is also a Sojern Client, we will recognize that you
   visited both websites and combine these two visits together in your
   Sojern Profile. When you see an ad for the same hotel you visited on
   another website, it may be because the advertising service used the
   Sojern Platform to help identify the ad as relevant to your interests.

   Cross-Device Tracking

   As previously noted, Sojern works with numerous service providers to
   attempt to facilitate a connection between web and mobile users. These
   cross-device vendors help us add your mobile website or application
   visits to your Sojern Profile for relevant advertising across web and
   mobile experiences. Some of these vendors may collect your unique
   mobile advertising ID through your operating system, and in the ‘Your
   Choices’ section below we describe various ways for you to control this
   specific use. However, in most cases the connection between a mobile
   and web user will be inferred or based on a high probability of it
   being the same user.

   Improving Sojern Products Through Intelligent Algorithms

   The Sojern Platform is designed to learn from every user, and
   continually be optimized to deliver the most relevant ads across the
   web for an improved user experience. In doing so, Sojern Profiles are
   continually updated with new information, which may include your
   initial search inquiry all the way through to when you book your trip.
   We use this data in numerous ways to improve the effectiveness of our
   Clients’ advertising campaigns. For example, following the recognition
   of a hotel booking, the Sojern Platform could then intelligently inform
   our advertisers to ‘turn off’ ads that may no longer be relevant to
   your hotel search request.

   Sojern will use any data collected or received to improve the
   effectiveness of existing Sojern Products and the user experience, as
   well as to create new products. This may include combining,
   aggregating, and developing new methods of analyzing or reporting data
   from, and with, our Data Partners or Clients.

   Synchronization For Ad Delivery

   Sojern is not an ‘ad server’ or ‘ad network’, which means we do not
   actually select ad placements or deliver any ads directly to you. For
   the Sojern Platform to be used, we need to synchronize our IDs with
   other parties who then select and facilitate ad delivery to web or
   mobile users. This synchronization process involves matching Sojern’s
   cookie or other IDs during an active web or mobile experience. For
   example, when you visit a Sojern Data Partner like a travel search
   website and the Sojern cookie is created, Sojern may immediately
   ‘call’, or be called from, another service provider to synchronize IDs
   and enable a future relevant ad delivery. Sojern then works with
   various advertising networks, including Google and Facebook, to
   synchronize our cookies and deliver relevant advertising through their
   platforms.

   Cookie Lifespan

   Cookies have an expiration date, and Sojern has set ours to expire in
   two years. However, this expiration is contingent upon not ‘seeing’
   that cookie again during that two-year period. Should you visit a
   Sojern Data Partner or Client prior to the two-year period being
   complete, your existing Sojern cookie will be updated with a new
   two-year expiration date.

SHARING YOUR INFORMATION

   The Sojern Platform is designed to service both Data Partners and
   Clients. We may share any information in the Sojern Platform with our
   Data Partners, Clients or service providers if it is necessary to
   facilitate or manage advertising campaigns. These Data Partners and
   Clients may use this information (and similar information collected
   elsewhere) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you
   when you visit non-Sojern related websites.

   In addition, we may disclose information to identify suspicious
   activity, resolve disputes or investigate problems. We may use or
   disclose information, including Personal Information, if we have a good
   faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as
   complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to
   disclose information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to
   protect the rights, property, or safety of Sojern, our employees, our
   community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service
   or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging
   information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
   or responding to government requests.

   We may disclose or share any, and all, information associated with
   Sojern Products in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
   merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any
   other situation where information may be disclosed or transferred as
   one of the business assets of Sojern. In the event of such a change of
   control of Sojern, all data will remain subject to the terms of the
   then-applicable privacy policy. Prior to such a change of control,
   Sojern will provide notice of a change on our website, and you will be
   given an opportunity to review the terms and potentially opt-out of any
   material changes prior to the control change taking place.

   Over time, Sojern may grow and reorganize. We may share your
   information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries,
   joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are
   under common control with us, as permitted by law and/or contract.  In
   such event, Sojern will endeavor to direct those companies to agree to
   use your information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy
   Policy.

   We may also share certain anonymous and aggregated information
   publicly, including with users, partners, prospects or the press in
   order to demonstrate how Sojern is used, spot industry trends, or to
   provide marketing or press materials for Sojern. Any aggregated
   information shared this way will not contain any personally
   identifiable information.

   As noted, we work with numerous vendors, service providers, and other
   partners to help us provide Sojern Products and services. We share or
   provide information (including Personal Information if deemed so by
   local laws) to them to help perform necessary business functions.
   Additionally, these service providers must adhere to confidentiality
   and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy
   Policy. In the Your Choices section below, we’ve identified some key
   service providers that you may choose to control some of your choices
   with regards to this type of data sharing.

YOUR CHOICES

   You have many options to block, delete or opt-out of Sojern’s tracking
   methods. In every contemporary Internet browser, you may elect to
   refuse Third Party cookies such as Sojern’s, or delete cookies
   altogether. However, should you block or delete Third Party cookies
   such as Sojern’s by adjusting your web browser settings, you will
   continue to receive online advertisements but those advertisements may
   be less relevant to you.

   For mobile users, you also have numerous controls in your Operating
   System that enable you to choose whether to allow cookies, or share
   your advertising ID with companies like Sojern. For some information on
   controlling your mobile choices, click here.

   In addition to browser or mobile controls, you may choose to opt-out
   directly from Sojern and many other advertising services through
   industry self-regulatory efforts. If you wish to opt-out of web-based
   ads (not specifically for mobile users) delivered through the Sojern
   Platform, you may do so by clicking here. Please note this only opts
   you out of behaviorally targeted ads through the Sojern Platform and
   does not opt you out of being served any travel-related advertising
   from other advertising services. When you opt out, we will place a
   cookie on your browser instructing us not to deliver a behaviorally
   targeted ad. Please note that there may be a delay in the ability to
   update the information and honor your choice, and if you delete your
   cookies, your opt-out request will no longer be recognized or honored.

   In addition, Sojern may receive signals from advertising service
   providers or Data Partners that request we limit the tracking of ads,
   independent from the process of creating or appending data to our
   traveler profiles. Should we receive these signals, we will honor the
   request to cease tracking and will limit the use of any data collected
   to research and development purposes only.

   You may also choose to opt-out of industry-wide Interest-Based
   Advertising (aka; online behavioral advertising) by clicking through to
   the regional Digital Advertising Alliance in your location:
     * U.S. Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
     * Digital Advertising Alliance Canada (DAAC)
     * European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA)

   To help control or block certain ads in mobile applications, you may
   choose to download and utilize the DAA mobile app:
     * U.S. Digital Advertising Alliance ‘Appchoices’ App

   Your Choices with Sojern’s Service Providers

   Sojern works in conjunction with numerous service providers who may
   also offer choices to opt-out of their advertising services. Please
   click below to learn more about your choices with these key Sojern
   service providers:
     * Google’s Display & Video 360 facilitates the ad selection and
       delivery of our Clients’ advertisements to both web and mobile
       users (including some mobile applications). Learn more here.
     * Tapad is a mobile solutions provider that helps facilitate an ID
       synchronization with our web-based cookies. Learn more here.

   In addition, Sojern works with mobile attribution providers who are
   associated with publishers that utilize Sojern for various mobile
   advertising services. In order to opt-out of data collection through
   these services, please refer to the choices listed in the privacy
   policies of the publishers you visit.

ACCESS, RETENTION, AND MANAGING PERSONAL INFORMATION

   To enable users to easily manage personal information we collect,
   Sojern has created a “Right of Access and Right to Erasure” tool,
   available here. If you wish to learn what information Sojern has about
   you, and/or to exercise your right to delete this information, we
   encourage you to use this tool.

   You may also submit a request for, Sojern to provide you with
   information about whether we hold any of your personal information.
   To make a personal information request, please refer to the Contacting
   Sojern section below, and we will respond to your request within a
   reasonable timeframe. Please note that we reserve the right to verify
   your identity and country of residency to determine if such access is
   required under your local laws. Please also note that because Sojern
   Products do not collect identifying information from End Users such as
   name or email address, we may need information from you such as your
   mobile advertising ID or cookie ID to locate the particular data we may
   have about you.

   If you have provided us personal information as a Client, or your
   personal information has been provided by a Client’s representative, we
   will inform you if we hold any of your personal information upon your
   request. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal
   information by logging in to your Sojern account or by contacting us at
   sojernprivacy@sojern.com. We will respond to your request within a
   reasonable timeframe.

   You may sign up to receive emails, newsletters or other communications
   from us. If you would like to discontinue receiving these
   communications, you may update your email preferences by using the
   “unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you, via your member
   profile on our website, or by contacting us at
   sojernprivacy@sojern.com.

   At the current time, Sojern retains collected data for as long as it is
   necessary to maintain the efficacy of the Sojern Products, provide our
   Clients services, and as needed to comply with our legal obligations,
   resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue
   legitimate business purposes, and enforce our agreements.

DATA SECURITY

   The security of your information is important to us.  Sojern utilizes
   standard frameworks, best practices, and programming language paradigms
   to prevent access to data stored in the Sojern Platform. Sojern employs
   strict controls around employee access to the Sojern Platform,
   including real-time monitoring through a third-party IT management
   vendor. Sojern maintains a comprehensive data access grid based on role
   and associated permissions to all tools and data stores within our data
   warehouse. Access is granted based on explicit business need and use
   cases which warrant access.  If you have any questions about the
   security of your information, please contact us as described below.

   The Sojern Platform is hosted through a cloud architecture provided by
   a Third Party, Google, Inc. Currently, the architecture hosted by
   Google in connection with providing the Sojern Platform and associated
   services is located in various locations around the world. Google’s
   data centers have access system controls in place, including a layered
   security model with numerous safeguards. Further information about
   security provided by Google is available from the Google Security Web
   site here.

INTERNATIONAL USERS

   Sojern Products are designed for a global market. Our Data Partners and
   Clients operate media properties around the world, and the Sojern
   Platform utilizes data collected from many countries. As noted, this
   data is stored within Google’s cloud hosting infrastructure in various
   locations around the world, including in the United States.

   Sojern participates in and has certified its compliance with the
   EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
   Framework. We are committed to subjecting all personal data received
   from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland,
   respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the
   Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy
   Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S.
   Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.

   Sojern is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives,
   under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a
   third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Sojern complies with the
   Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data
   from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability
   provisions. With respect to personal data received or transferred
   pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Sojern is subject to the
   regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In
   certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in
   response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet
   national security or law enforcement requirements.

   Under certain conditions more fully described on the Privacy Shield
   website you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other
   dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

CHILDREN & CA RESIDENTS

   Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other minimum
   age as required by local law) and we do not knowingly collect Personal
   Information from children under 13.  If you learn that your child has
   provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may
   alert us at sojernprivacy@sojern.com. If we learn that we have
   collected Personal Information of a child under 13 we will take steps
   to delete such information from our files as soon as possible and
   terminate the child’s account.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

   Do Not Track

   Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
   Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a
   technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites
   visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting.
   Sojern does not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals
   with respect to the Site. For more information on “do not track”,
   please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.

   Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83(c)(2), Sojern does

   marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.
   If we do share Personal Information  with Third-Parties for their
   direct marketing purposes and you authorize us to include your
   information, we will only share that information in connection with
   that specific promotion. To prevent disclosure of your Personal
   Information  for use in direct marketing by a Third Party, do not opt
   in to such use when you provide Personal Information on our Site or the

   use your Personal Information, you will need to contact the Third Party
   directly.

   Protecting consumer privacy is important for Sojern and a top priority.

   Even though most of our products are not consumer facing and we act as
   a service provider to our various clients without directly interacting
   with their end users, we felt it was extremely important to post a
   privacy policy for our advertising products to allow for transparency
   into our practices for both our clients and their end users.

   We have a separate website privacy policy for our sojern.com corporate
   site.

   You will find on this page all of Sojern’s privacy policies and other

Leonardo’s Tips for an Effective SEO Strategy & How to Gain Direct Bookings

   April 28, 2017

   This week, I was thrilled to be a guest speaker on Sojern’s webinar,
   "Search Engine Marketing for Hotels: Making Sense of Organic and Paid.”
   It’s a timely topic for Leonardo, given the recent launch of new SEO
   Marketing Service with our Vizlly solution. Search Engine Optimization
   (SEO) is a complex beast; it’s time-consuming and constantly evolving.
   With that said, hoteliers should understand the basics if they want to
   succeed in today’s digital landscape. Webinars like this one from
   Sojern are a great place to start.
