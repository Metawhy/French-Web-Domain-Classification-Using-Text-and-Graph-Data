Try This: Color Block Mood Board

   Budget: $$, D.I.Y. Project, Home Decor, One Day Project, Organization,
   Renter Friendly
   By Rachel Denbow

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board Hi, it's Rachel! One of the first
   projects I knew I wanted to incorporate in my newly repainted studio
   basement was a mood board to display inspiration for the many projects
   I have planned in the coming months. In the past I've used a collection
   of clipboards screwed into the wall, the inside doors of a wardrobe,
   and even a generic cork board, but this time I wanted something
   portable that made a statement all by itself. All it took was a few
   inexpensive supplies and a little over an hour to create a strong focal
   point for my new space.

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board (steps) 1. Supplies: A piece of MDF
   that I had cut down to about 4' x 2.5'. You can use pre-cut hardwood
   but you will need to sand it for a smooth finish. Acrylic paint in two
   or more colors, washi tape, a 4" wide paintbrush or small roller for a
   smoother finish, paper towels or cardboard to protect your floors and
   walls. 2. Starting with a clean surface, paint your first coat. You may
   or may not need to add an additional coat depending on the kind of
   acrylic paint you use. I had to dilute mine with water for a smoother
   finish. Wait for that to dry. 3. Tape off your design. I originally
   wanted to add polka-dots or crosses in gold, but it wasn't showing up
   well so I went another direction. I taped off a triangle shape that was
   centered slightly above the middle of the board. 4. I then added two
   coats of my lighter color making sure not to paint over the tape line.
   Had this been my original plan I would've painted the lightest color
   first and then added the darker color second. Wait for it to dry and
   then remove your tape.

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board I love how much color it adds to this
   space. If you wanted something a little more neutral you could easily
   go with black chalkboard paint, black and white stripes, or polka-dots.
   It keeps the background interesting without being too distracting to
   see what you've added to your board. It's a renter-friendly project
   since it doesn't need to be hung on the wall, but I would suggest
   taking care to secure it if you have small children in your space.

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board Use washi tape and push pins to
   adhere your photos, magazine pages, and random inspiration. Do you use
   a mood board in your home or office? Do you change it up according to
   seasons or whenever inspiration strikes? xo.Rachel

       I bought a four-pack of mini cork boards about a week ago but I’ve
       been hesitant to put them up in my studio because I wasn’t quite
       sure what I wanted to do with them to make them POP! I thought
       maybe putting fabric over the squares or maybe just using them for
       a vision board but I never thought of painting them until seeing
       this post so THANK YOU!, for the inspiration. I still don’t know
       what I want to put on the cork board but at least for now I can get
       to painting them and hanging them up.

       That looks awesome! I love the colors you used and this is
       definitely going on my to do list of projects to add to my home
       office. I usually use a large sketch book to list all my projects
       but this definitely seems a lot better given that it immediately
       gives me a quick glance at everything. Love, love, love it!

       I’ve created mood boards on the computer, but I’ve never seen one
       come to life. I love the colors here, especially the pastel pink.
       Washi tape as a photo holder is such a nice idea.

Try This: Color Block Mood Board

   Budget: $$, D.I.Y. Project, Home Decor, One Day Project, Organization,
   Renter Friendly
   By Rachel Denbow

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board Hi, it's Rachel! One of the first
   projects I knew I wanted to incorporate in my newly repainted studio
   basement was a mood board to display inspiration for the many projects
   I have planned in the coming months. In the past I've used a collection
   of clipboards screwed into the wall, the inside doors of a wardrobe,
   and even a generic cork board, but this time I wanted something
   portable that made a statement all by itself. All it took was a few
   inexpensive supplies and a little over an hour to create a strong focal
   point for my new space.

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board (steps) 1. Supplies: A piece of MDF
   that I had cut down to about 4' x 2.5'. You can use pre-cut hardwood
   but you will need to sand it for a smooth finish. Acrylic paint in two
   or more colors, washi tape, a 4" wide paintbrush or small roller for a
   smoother finish, paper towels or cardboard to protect your floors and
   walls. 2. Starting with a clean surface, paint your first coat. You may
   or may not need to add an additional coat depending on the kind of
   acrylic paint you use. I had to dilute mine with water for a smoother
   finish. Wait for that to dry. 3. Tape off your design. I originally
   wanted to add polka-dots or crosses in gold, but it wasn't showing up
   well so I went another direction. I taped off a triangle shape that was
   centered slightly above the middle of the board. 4. I then added two
   coats of my lighter color making sure not to paint over the tape line.
   Had this been my original plan I would've painted the lightest color
   first and then added the darker color second. Wait for it to dry and
   then remove your tape.

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board I love how much color it adds to this
   space. If you wanted something a little more neutral you could easily
   go with black chalkboard paint, black and white stripes, or polka-dots.
   It keeps the background interesting without being too distracting to
   see what you've added to your board. It's a renter-friendly project
   since it doesn't need to be hung on the wall, but I would suggest
   taking care to secure it if you have small children in your space.

   Try This : Color Block Mood Board Use washi tape and push pins to
   adhere your photos, magazine pages, and random inspiration. Do you use
   a mood board in your home or office? Do you change it up according to
   seasons or whenever inspiration strikes? xo.Rachel

       I bought a four-pack of mini cork boards about a week ago but I’ve
       been hesitant to put them up in my studio because I wasn’t quite
       sure what I wanted to do with them to make them POP! I thought
       maybe putting fabric over the squares or maybe just using them for
       a vision board but I never thought of painting them until seeing
       this post so THANK YOU!, for the inspiration. I still don’t know
       what I want to put on the cork board but at least for now I can get
       to painting them and hanging them up.

       in another colour!!!
       Love and good morning from Germany,

typewriter poetry October 07, 2013
       I love this! And just in time for me…I’m decorating/creating my
       booth for Artisanal LA this week.
       My typewriter is a similar pink. Can you tell me what the names of
       the paints you used? I’d really appreciate it!

       That looks awesome! I love the colors you used and this is
       definitely going on my to do list of projects to add to my home
       office. I usually use a large sketch book to list all my projects
       but this definitely seems a lot better given that it immediately
       gives me a quick glance at everything. Love, love, love it!

       So cute, great idea to have something inexpensive like this to
       revamp with the seasons! My room would be overpowered by a feature
       wall, perhaps this is the alternative to add a pop of colour. Love
       it 🙂

       I’ve created mood boards on the computer, but I’ve never seen one
       come to life. I love the colors here, especially the pastel pink.
       Washi tape as a photo holder is such a nice idea.

       I love this idea! Such a bold statement all by itself and then
       adding pretty things to it puts it over the top! Might have to
       throw one of these together once I get an office-like space!
