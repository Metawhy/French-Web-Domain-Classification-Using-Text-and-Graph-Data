   Millions of birds flock to Alaska each spring from around the globe,
   making this a crucial place for birds worldwide. From the icy,
   bountiful waters of the Arctic Ocean to the misty, salmon-rich
   rainforests of the Tongass National Forest, Audubon Alaska works to
   conserve Alaska's spectacular birds and other wildlife—and their
   habitats— to ensure their place for future generations. We employ
   science and state-of-the-art mapping technology to drive our
   conservation priorities, with an emphasis on public lands and waters.

Alaska WatchList

   Highlighting Declining and Vulnerable Bird Populations

   Audubon Alaska’s Alaska WatchList uses an objective assessment process
   to identify Alaska birds of greatest conservation concern.

   The 2017 Alaska WatchList recognizes two levels of conservation
   concern:
     * The Red List has the highest level of conservation concern: species
       are vulnerable and declining.
     * The Yellow List is of somewhat lesser concern: species are
       vulnerable, but not declining.

   Download the Red List here, or view an interactive web version here.

   Download the Yellow List here.

   Download a list of common species in decline here. These species did
   not make the Red or Yellow List, but they still merit close attention.

   If you would like a hard copy of the Alaska WatchList, please email
   ksmith@audubon.org or call (907) 276-7034.

   What is the Alaska WatchList?
   The Alaska WatchList is a science-based warning system to identify
   birds at risk. It is a tool to focus attention on vulnerable and
   declining bird populations across the state. Audubon Alaska compiles
   the WatchList every few years by objectively ranking each regularly
   occurring bird species (and select subspecies) in Alaska based on
   vulnerability. We consider factors such as population size, population
   trend, threats, and percentage of the population that is dependent on
   Alaska habitats. It is a scientific process that is transparent and
   data-driven. Click here to download a Technical Report that outlines
   the methods and references used to compile the WatchList.

   Attempting to recover species at the brink of extinction is difficult
   and costly. Working cooperatively to protect birds and their habitats
   before crises arise is far more effective. Hence, the primary aim of
   the WatchList is to encourage research, monitoring, and conservation by
   agencies, organizations, and concerned individuals to prevent birds
   from becoming threatened or endangered.
