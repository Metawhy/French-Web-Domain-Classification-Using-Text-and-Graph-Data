Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.

   You don't need to write any code to create a simple story with Twine,
   but you can extend your stories with variables, conditional logic,
   images, CSS, and JavaScript when you're ready.

   Twine publishes directly to HTML, so you can post your work nearly
   anywhere. Anything you create with it is completely free to use any way
   you like, including for commercial purposes.

   Twine was originally created by Chris Klimas in 2009 and is now
   maintained by a whole bunch of people at several different
   repositories.

   A new tool has emerged that empowers just about anyone to create a
   game. It's called Twine. It's extremely easy to use, and it has already
   given rise to a lively and diverse development scene.

   Carolyn Petit, Gamespot

   Although plenty of independent games venture where mainstream games
   fear to tread, Twine represents something even more radical: the
   transformation of video games into something that is not only consumed
   by the masses but also created by them.

   Laura Hudson, The New York Times Magazine

   The simple beauty of Twine is this: if you can type words and
   occasionally put brackets around some of those words, you can make a
   Twine game.

   Kitty Horrorshow

   If you're interested in making interactive fiction then there's no
   better place to start than Twine. It's possibly the simplest game
   making tool available, it will take you mere minutes to get started,
   and it has a wonderfully simple visual editor.

   Richard Perrin

   And aside from being free, it's really not programming at all — if you
   can write a story, you can make a Twine game.

   Anna Anthropy

   Twine is the closest we've come to a blank page. It binds itself and it
   can bind itself along an infinite number of spines extending in any
   direction.
