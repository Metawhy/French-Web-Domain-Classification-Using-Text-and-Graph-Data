Product Privacy Policy

DynAdmic provides advertising services (our “Services”) to a variety of
companies.

   Our services are primarily focused on helping advertisers to serve
   relevant ads to the right audience at the right time. DynAdmic is
   offering a new targeting concept based on a video content recognition
   technology that helps identify viewers' interests to serve the right ad
   to the right person. (Demo of concept:
   https://www.dynadmic.com/howitworks.) We use our never-before-seen
   contextual targeting solution to sell tailored and highly focused
   branding campaigns to the world's largest brands and agencies. Our
   clients include Emirates, Red Bull, Kellogg's, Audi, etc.

   This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect
   and receive about users.

Information we receive and collect

   We collect your information when you and others are using browsers and
   devices while visiting or using websites, apps, and advertisements that
   use our Services.

   We collect some of this information using cookies, web beacons, and
   similar technologies. The information we collect includes, among other
   things: device type, operating system, unique identifiers, IP address,
   location, browser type & language, and header information such as URLs
   and date/time stamps. We do not collect personally identifiable
   information, such as your name or email address.

   We use all of the information we gather to improve and provide our
   advertising, measurement, and reporting Services.

   Depending on how you access and use our Services, we may receive
   information related to:
   - Your interactions with the websites, apps, and other services you
   use; the content you view; and your clicks or engagements on ads
   - How you access those websites, apps, and other services
   - Your browser or operating system
   - Your IP address and the website you visited before visiting our
   Services
   - The type of device you are using (i.e. iPhone, tablet, Dell desktop)
   - Your location based on your IP address
   - Your location based on the GPS coordinates of your mobile/tablet
   device
   - The Identifier for Advertisers (IFA or IDFA) of your mobile/tablet
   device
   - Your DynAdmic user ID, an identifier randomly generated by DynAdmic
   stored as a cookie on your browser

   We also collect information from third parties, such as our customers
   and partners, which includes advertisers, marketing partners, and
   service providers related to their use and support of our Services. The
   information can include demographics, purchase information, and and
   interests, which helps us determine which ads are shown on your browser
   or device and helps us measure the effectiveness of the ads. The
   collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and
   legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is
   not governed by DynAdmic.

Use of the information we have

   We use the information we have to find and match appropriate audiences
   with appropriate advertisements and to serve customized ads to your
   browser or device. To do this, we may use information we have about
   your activities over time and across different websites, apps,
   browsers, and devices. We may also decide to show an ad based on the
   website or app you are using, the video content you are watching,
   things you may be interested in, or requests from our advertising
   partners, who decide to show ads to a particular audience, sometimes
   using information they have on file. We also use the information we
   have to optimize ad delivery, such as managing the frequency and the
   order in which the ads are shown.

   To be more efficient, we can use the information we collected to
   associate the browsers and devices you use so we can provide better and
   more consistent experiences across browsers and devices, as well as
   improve our Services. We also use the information we have for the
   following purposes:
   - Limiting the number of times you see the same ad
   - Measure the effectiveness of the ads we serve
   - Provide more effective measurements and reporting Services.

How to opt out of the targeted ads delivered to you by DynAdmic

   From a browser (desktop, mobile, tablet)
   If you wish not to be exposed to our specific targeted ads displayed
   from a browser (Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome,
   Firefox, Safari ....) you can opt-out by using the following link.
   Please note that you can also configure your browser to disable the
   cookies. As this operation depends on the browser, we advise you to
   consult the Help section of your browser.
   From mobile application(s)
   You can reset your Mobile Advertising ID and remove some unwanted ads
   by following the processes:
   - for Apple devices visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074
   - for Android devices, visit
   https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en
   Please note:
   - You will still receive advertisements; however, they will no longer
   be provided by us, nor will they be targeted by our system.
   - You will need to repeat this procedure if you delete your cookies,
   change your computer, or change your Internet connection.

How is this information shared?

   We work with advertisers and other partners in order to provide and
   improve our Services. We share information with these organizations as
   a part of these efforts.

   Here are the types of organizations we can share information with about
   you:
   - Customers or partners:
   We may share with advertisers and their partners the information we
   collect on their websites and apps or in connection with their
   advertisements. We share aggregated or other non-personally identifying
   information with customers and partners that help them place or
   understand the ad performance. For example, we share non-personally
   identifiable information with these entities that tells them how many
   people saw their ad, how many people visited their website or app, the
   demographics of the audience, and whether the ad served achieved a
   desired result such as whether those who saw a company's ad clicked on
   the ad or purchased the advertised product. We also share aggregated
   information that is not connected with a particular ad campaign, such
   as the number of people we have assigned to general interest categories
   or segments.
   - Service providers, vendors and other partners:
   We share information that we collect with vendors, service providers,
   and others who work under our direction in order to help us support and
   provide our Services and websites globally.
   - Change in control:
   If there is change in assets or ownership or control of all or part of
   our Services, we may transfer the information we have to the new owner.

   The information shared is always with a unique identifier, not
   personally identifiable information, such as your name or email
   address.

How do we store information?

   Information that we receive, including information collected within the
   European Economic Area (“EEA”) and elsewhere around the world, may be
   transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States, Canada,
   European Union, or any other country globally for the purposes
   described in this policy. We typically retain information that we
   collect through our Services for 12 months, after which we delete and
   aggregate the information.

   We rely on hosting providers, such as Amazon AWS and OVH, in the
   European Economic Area (“EEA”), Canada and the United States.
   These providers ensure a level of data protection in accordance with
   current EEA regulations such as the GDPR, the Privacy Shield, and more.
   For more information, you can consult the following links:
   https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/
   https://www.ovh.com/fr/protection-donnees-personnelles/

Protecting you, ourselves, and others

   We may use information to detect, prevent, investigate, and address
   fraud and other unauthorized or illegal activity; to protect ourselves,
   you, and others, including as part of investigations; or otherwise to
   prevent harm.

Providing and improving Services

   We use the information we have to support our services through
   activities such as infrastructure monitoring and internal maintenance,
   analyzation of how our services are used, research and development, and
   billing.
