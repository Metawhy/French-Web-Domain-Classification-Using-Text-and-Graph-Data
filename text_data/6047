Victorian Children, Consumerism, and Licking Alum

   May 4, 2017 / JaneSuzanneCarroll / Leave a comment

   I just published a piece for The Conversation on my research on the
   Great Exhibition, children’s literature, and how the Victorians taught
   their children about sustainability and consumerism.

   I know it’s not about craft – though it is about archives in a way –
   but I promise I am working on some new posts. More later.

Making Use of the Archives

   May 23, 2016 / JaneSuzanneCarroll / Leave a comment

   I’m making use of a number of different archives in my current research
   project. For the most part, I’m looking at texts – specifically
   children’s books. I’ve looked at books from…

The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe of Vintage Clothes

   January 10, 2016 / JaneSuzanneCarroll / 1 Comment

   IMG_20160108_161656067.jpg

   This week, I’ve been mostly marking essays from my undergraduate module
   Origins and Developments of Children’s Literature. Actually, I’ve been
   mostly marking essays about C.S. Lewis’s The Lion, The Witch and the
   Wardrobe (1950) because the majority of the class are completely
   fixated on the book and want to write about it. Which is no bad thing
   really.[1]

   I’ve done a lot of research about C.S. Lewis, particularly into in his
   use of landscape and the role that his memories of Ireland and his
   relationship with Ireland play in his fiction. I’ve given a couple of
   talks about his work and there was a brief time when I thought I might
   write my next book about his Narnia series. But then I got distracted
   by Victorian children’s books and the possibilities of archvies I’ve
   had to put Narnia aside for another day….

   But I still get to lecture about Lewis and Narnia every year which is
   some compensation.

   The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe was published in 1950 though it
   was conceived of rather earlier. Lewis wrote to a friend in 1948 to say
   he was working on a children’s story “in the tradition of E Nesbit” and
   in his autobiography, Surprised by Joy, he notes that the image of the
   faun in the snow had come to him when he was a teenager. But the story
   is set during World War II and it bears the marks of its wartime
   setting throughout.

   Several critics have noted the influence of rationing on the story.
   Judy Rosenbaum observes that the meal Lucy shares with Mr Tumnus

     “is not, it would seem, a feast befitting a wondrous kingdom. Yet
     meals of this simple, hearty variety abound in Narnia. One reason
     might be that as Lewis wrote the Narnian Chronicles, England was
     still living under stringent wartime/postwar food rationing. Every
     English child would have savored reading about these meals.”[2]

   But the description of the meal doesn’t just make it seem like a
   wonderful treat in the midst of rationing, it also suggests that
   there’s something very odd about Mr Tumnus. The meal he provides for
   Lucy is almost totally comprised of items that were rationed and were
   increasingly hard to come by. So, the tea may even hint that there is
   something sinister about Mr Tumnus. Is he a black-marketer? Does this
   luxury and abundance come from his alliance with the White Witch?

   But the aspect of rationing that interests me is clothes rationing.

   Clothes rationing  came into effect in Britain in 1941. There are
   numerous  blogs about vintage fashion that cover the topic. Lucky
   Lucille has a fantastic round up of links about different aspects of
   rationingand The History Girls have some brilliant resources, including
   a review of the Imperial War Museum’s “Fashion on the Ration”
   exhibition.  One of the best things I’ve stumbled across is a radio
   show called “Harry and Edna on the Wireless” which combines old-timey
   tunes with up-to-date chats about the vintage scene: this episode
   features an interview with Laura Clouting, the curator of the “Fashion
   on the Ration” exhibition, and historian Julie Summers (who has her own
   wonderful blog here).

   Clothes were so strictly rationed that, as Laura Clouting points out, a
   new outfit was seen as something you saved up for, a ‘dream’ purchase
   for some future after the war ended.[3]

   Clothes play an essential part in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe
   – they help to describe character and they shape relationships between
   characters. The children enter Narnia through a wardrobe (which is full
   of fur coats and mothballs).

   So, for the most recent lecture on C.S. Lewis and The Lion, The Witch
   and the Wardrobe, I decided to focus on the role clothing plays in the
   text.


   In the seminar on Lewis and Narnia, I put up the clothing allowances
   and the number of coupons allocated to each item and ask students to
   add up how many coupons their outfits would have cost them.
   Men&Boysrationcard
   Women&Girlsrationcard

   There are always gasps of horror and giggles as we realise how prodigal
   our attitudes to clothing have become. There’s usually an argument
   about why dresses should ‘cost’ more than trousers and why men’s shoes
   have to cost more than women’s shoes, regardless of the size. Most of
   this year’s group were either cutting it fine or well over the rationed
   allowance (wearing socks over a pair of tights was a particular
   extravagance). One student this year had an outfit that ‘cost’ 60
   coupons – more than a whole year’s ration. And then there’s always the
   moment that the realisation sinks in…no more new clothes for a whole
   year.

   Always winter, never Christmas.

   Which makes clothes in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe all the
   more interesting.

   Think about the wonderful new clothes bestowed on the children when
   they reach Aslan’s camp. Or think about the luxurious furs worn by the
   White Witch and the weight and warmth of the mantle she drapes over
   Edmund.

   Clothes also reveal much about the characters in the story. For
   instance, Mr Tumnus’ dual nature is show by the contrast between his
   bare torso (his Pan-like wildness) and the red scarf muffling his
   throat (his essential domesticity).

   In terms of rationing, we can look to the Beavers:

   At the Beavers’ house, Mrs Beaver is busy sewing when the children
   arrive. Like the freshly-prepared meal that nourishes the children,
   sewing is a sign of a deeper trustworthiness. It’s a sign that the
   Beavers, unlike Mr Tumnus or Jadis, are frugal and are willing to make
   do and mend. Though they are Narnians, the Beavers adhere to the codes
   of food and fashion the children are familiar with from war-time
   England.[5]

   And so to the wardrobe of war-time clothes…

   When I visited the archives at the Imperial War Museum I found a bundle
   of knitting patterns. Some of them were terrible – things that could
   only be made for a joke, or for a post-apocalyptic horror movie where
   there’s no heating and fashion has been murdered in its sleep. But
   other patterns had the potential to pass as real garments and I planned
   to make a couple of them. The first one I made was a land girl’s
   pullover.

   But then other projects and other archives grabbed my attention and I
   didn’t really think about the possible projects from the IWM for a long
   time.

   Then in Autumn I heard that twin-sets were back.

   I’m now pretty certain that this is a lie but the internet did a pretty
   good job of persuading me twin-sets were, indeed, THE thing to wear
   this winter. And I was pretty sure that Peggy Carter would be
   everyone’s idea of a style icon and I was certain that a twin-set would
   be just the ticket.

   And so I turned to my notes and rediscovered this thing of magnificent
   and hideous beauty.

   Striped Twin-set from Vogue’s 20th Knitting Book

   Just look at those shoulders!

   This striped twin-set is from Vogue’s 20^th Knitting book. I don’t have
   an exact publication date but the advertisement for Sandisons Real
   Shetland Yarns printed to the right of the pattern makes reference to
   coupons so I know it was published while rationing was still in effect.


   IMG_20160108_161921093

   This issue and several other issues of Vogue were used in the Imperial
   War Museum’s “Fashion on the Ration” exhibition.

   The original pattern calls for 12oz of Sirdar Super Shetland 3-ply in
   dark green and 3oz of the same in light green. After a bit of
   research[6] I found out there was approximately 140 yards to the ounce
   of this yarn. It’s unavailable now so I cast on in Mabel and Ivy’s
   Supersoft 2-ply (Prussian blue because green makes me look like I need
   a lot of sleep and a generous amount of rouge). The Supersoft is
   rapidly becoming my go-to yarn for vintage projects.

   Because I hate seaming, I decided to cast on the back and fronts
   together and knit them as a single piece. This didn’t seem to affect
   the overall width of the cardigan. The pattern suggests that it’s for a
   34’’ bust but there is a lot of ease and the shape of the body
   (increasing gradually in width from the waistband to the underarms)
   leads to a very generous fit.

   The pattern instructions are here. The magazine is laid out very
   strangely so I’ve had to use several images to reproduce the pattern.
   If you follow them in order, all should be well.

   Modifications

   Needles: I could not get gauge using the needles suggested in the
   pattern so I went down a couple of sizes. The ribbing was worked with a
   2.5mm needle and the stocking-stitch worked with a 2.75mm needle.

   Sleeves: I’ve had problems with the sleeves on vintage patterns before
   so I decided to add an extra half inch to the suggested length for the
   sleeves.

   Buttonholes: The original pattern suggests adding buttonholes where
   needed as you knit but I wanted to try on the finished cardigan first
   before I decided how many buttons to use or where to place them. So I
   decided to add buttonholes afterwards as part of a buttonband. Once I
   had the cardigan finished I tried it on and marked where I wanted
   buttons with safety pins.

   Button band: I don’t hate myself and so I decided not the follow the
   pattern for the buttonband (which suggests casting on six stitches and
   knitting back and forward until you have a strip long enough to face
   the entire edge of the cardigan). I picked up stitches with the 2.5mm
   needle and worked in K1P1 rib for 7 rows, adding button holes in the
   3rd/4th row, before casting off in rib.

   Shoulders: When I tried on the finished cardigan I realised that it was
   designed for someone with a serious addiction to shoulder-pads. As you
   can see from the photos above, it looks like it’s falling off my
   shoulders and I am losing the effect of that lovely high sleeve cap. I
   either have to invest in some shoulder pads or I will need to put a
   couple of stitches in the top of the sleeve to secure the sleeve cap in
   place and give the effect of narrowing the shoulders without having to
   rip back or fold the fabric. Will experiment and update.

   Pocket Flaps: I haven’t made these yet – I’m waiting to see if I have
   yarn left over from the sweater before I do anything rash.

   Next up – half a dozen other vintage projects including trying to cook
   from William Morris’s recipe file, knitting from a 19th century lace
   pattern for Glasgow University’s Knitting in the Round Project, and my
   part in Roehampton University’s bran-new Archiving Childhood Project.
   And making the jumper for this twin-set!

                              Hats fit for Heroes

   September 26, 2015 / JaneSuzanneCarroll / 1 Comment

   Hats_large

   I have some exciting news.

   A couple of weeks ago, Charlotte from Palace Green Library at Durham
   University got in touch to ask if I would like to be involved in their
   Hats Fit for Heroes charity campaign. As part of their upcoming
   exhibition ‘Antarctica: Explorers, Heroes, Scientists’ (opens 17th
   October) the Palace Green Library in Durham are running a knitting
   event called ‘Hats fit for Heroes’. The idea is to ask
   knitters/crocheters/sewers to make hats based on those worn by
   Antarctic explorers and then to sell them with all of the proceeds
   going to Walking with the Wounded, a charity that works with wounded
   service men and women and which last year organised an Antarctic trek.

   My Tom Crean Teacosy Hat pattern is one of the patterns they chose for
   the campaign.

   I’m delighted to be part of the campaign. I’m very excited by the fact
   that something I did with this blog could have a real impact on the
   lives of others. I never thought that a teacosy could change lives! And
   I never thought anyone would ever describe me as a designer. But there
   you are.

   If you missed the original post, you can read all about Tom Crean and
   his mighty hat here. Since I posted that piece back in February, I’ve
   been following Antarctic Discovery, a blog that publishes pieces from
   Shackleton’s diary. It makes for fascinating reading and I’d recommend
   it if you want to find out more about Antarctic explorers of the heroic
   era.

   Hats have already started to arrive at Palace Green Library and I’m
   really pleased to see that there’s a couple of tea-cosy hats there
   already!

   Here’s all the details from Palace Green Library about the campaign:

   ***

   Could you knit, crochet or sew a hat fit for a hero?

   As part of our upcoming exhibition ‘Antarctica: Explorers, Heroes,
   Scientists’ (opening 17^th Oct 2015), Palace Green Library in Durham is
   seeking crafting enthusiasts to make hats fit for heroes, inspired by
   Antarctic explorers.

   All proceeds will be donated to Walking with the Wounded, a charity
   working with wounded service men and women across the UK. The charity
   organised a trek across the Antarctic in 2013
   (www.walkingwiththewounded.org.uk).

   How can I help?

   Get crafty and create your own hat fit for a hero. You can knit,
   crochet or sew your hat, and it can be adult or child sized. Be as
   creative as you like but if you are using someone else’s pattern,
   please make sure you have permission to make a hat that can be sold for
   charity.  If you are looking for a knitting pattern, we have teamed up
   with Woolaballoo in Hexham and knitting designers Jane Carroll of
   ‘Archives and Old Lace’ and Angelea McGarrah have kindly agreed to the
   use of their patterns based on authentic explorer hats. These will be
   available on our website in the next few weeks:
   www.durham.ac.uk/palace.green/headstart

   Then simply bring along your finished hat to one of the drop off points
   in Durham, Hexham or Harrogate:
     * Palace Green Library, Durham
     * Woolabaloo, Market Square, Hexham
     * Woolabaloo stall, Hall B, The Knitting and Stitching Show,
       Harrogate (26-29 November only)

   Or you can post your hat to:

   Palace Green Library
   Palace Green
   Durham
   DH1 3RN

   We need to receive your hat no later than 30 November 2015. Please
   include your name and up to 50 words about your hat.

   We are also running two free craft workshops with pattern giveaways to
   help get you started – details to follow.

   We will be selling our hats from 1 December 2015  in the gift shop at
   Palace Green Library, Durham. All hats will cost £15.00 with all
   profits going to Walking with the Wounded.  We hope to raise even more
   money as Barclays Bank has kindly agreed to match fund the first £1,000
   raised.

   If you can, we’d love you to print and display the attached poster in
   your venue. If you need any further information or would like us to
   send you some printed flyers, please don’t hesitate to contact the good
   people at Palace Green Library: pg.library@durham.ac.uk or follow them

                            Make do and mend weekend

   September 20, 2015 / JaneSuzanneCarroll / 3 Comments

   It’s been a make do and mend sort of weekend.

   I spent Saturday morning at a darning workshop with Tom van Deijnen
   (better known as Tom of Holland) at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford.

   WP_20150919_001

   Tom of Holland is a textiles practitioner who specialises in mending
   and in visible repair. He talked to the group about his practice and
   his decision to repair things, not because of a need to ‘make do’ but
   because of a desire to engage more deeply with the things we use and
   consume. As makers, we grow to love the things we have made. Every time
   we pull on a pair of hand-knit socks or wrap ourselves in a hand-made
   blanket, we are reminded of the story of the item – the hours put into
   making it, the materials within it, its flaws, its beauties. It’s all
   too easy to overlook the stories behind the objects we buy from the
   high street, or to see these stories as less valuable. Repair can help
   us to re-engage with these items and add new strands to the story.

   In the workshop, we learned two darning techniques: Swiss darning
   (which is a bit like embroidering on knitted fabric) and stocking
   darning (for repairing holes in knitted fabric). Tom showed us some
   beautiful examples of decorative darning and encouraged us to try
   things out, to make mistakes, and to be brave with our new skills.

   I found Swiss darning sort of relaxing. There’s a nice rhythm to the
   needle swinging in and out of the fabric, following the path of the
   original yarn.  After about ten minutes I was totally addicted. I want
   to Swiss darn everything. Cushions. Jumpers. Socks. The backs of other
   people’s coats on the bus. I could be like a darning Zorro, leaving my
   mark on everyone that comes within reach of my needle.
   zorro

   Obviously, my hat will be much nicer than his

   Thankfully, just before I got completely carried away, we had a break
   from the darning and were taken on a little tour of repaired items in
   the Pitt Rivers museum. There’s a special exhibition on at the moment –
   Preserving What is Valued – and a museum trail of repaired objects. The
   tour added a different dimension to the workshop. There’s a tradition
   of mending that extends across the world, to every community and it was
   interesting to see where our own practices and habits fit into this
   tradition.

   After the tour, we came back to the workshop space and learned stocking
   darning (also called web darning) which I found trickier because
   knitted fabric just wants to stretch and filling in the holes feels a
   little like working against, rather than with, the fabric. I wasn’t so
   enthusiastic about stocking darning – I didn’t want to mob people on
   the bus – but I can see how functional it is and how useful it will be.
   I can think of at least four things in the house that need to be darned
   and now I sort of know how to do it.*
   WP_20150919_010

   My first attempts at Swiss darning and a stocking darn

   So, Sunday came round and I was keen to try out my new darning skills.
   I settled in with a pair of very holey socks (so holey they could
   belong in a shrine), a cup of tea, and A Playful Day’s podcast which,
   serendipitously, was an interview with Jen Gale of Make do and
   Mendable.

   WP_20150920_001

   And then I REALLY started to think about mending…

   Jen’s No New Clothes for a Year challenge seems tough. I love the idea
   of the slow wardrobe and I’m more likely to buy wool or fabric than new
   clothes from the high street but I feel that a total ban would be hard.
   There are things I just don’t know how to make – like shoes and
   waterproof coats and jeans – and I don’t know if I can really do
   without them. Am I cheating on my slow wardrobe if I go out to buy
   quick fixes? Is saying “I don’t buy things from the high street except
   for X” really hypocritical? Kate and Jen discussed the fears and the
   stumbling blocks that stand in the way of embracing this sort of
   sustainable living. For me, I worry about the feeling of denial
   (insert the long shadow of an Irish childhood here) Would it feel like
   a year-long Lent? How does this feeling of denial tally with the
   inspired, happy feelings I want to associate with my crafting? I find
   myself strangely reminded of Jeanette Winterson’s discussion of
   fasting – and I’m thinking about how greed and consumption apply to
   fashion and material culture, just as much as they do to food.

   I’ve been thinking about sustainable and fashion and my own practices
   as a consumer a lot more recently. Some of this was sparked by teaching
   war-time texts and discussing rationing in Britain with students. When
   I teach C.S. Lewis’ The Lion, The Witch, and the Unicorn, I bring in
   rationing books and get the students to ‘add up’ how many coupons they
   would need to purchase the outfits they are wearing to class. We
   normally find that very few people could ‘afford’ their outfits under
   the strict rules around the clothing-ration in 1940s
   Britain.** Recently, I found my conscience piqued by the 2015
   documentary The True Cost.  The documentary is sober and sobering – it
   talks about the problems of consumption in the western world and,
   particularly, our problem of confusing the things we use (like clothes
   and furniture) with things we use up (like food and fuel). The idea of
   throwing something out because it has gone out of fashion is crazy. And
   our appetite for endless things is getting out of hand. We have a
   consumption crisis. Our wardrobes are obese.

   And so I’m having a make do and mend weekend. I’ve just book
   marked Felicity Ford’s wonderful post about gathering a Slow Wardrobe
   so I can go back and read it. I need to think about how making and
   buying work together and what role mending can play in my own life. I’d
   love to hear your thoughts on this too. Do you mend things? Do you have
   a slow wardrobe? What are the stumbling blocks you’ve found on the way?
   How did you over come them? And what advice can you give me?

   ~

   *I was always warned that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing”.
   But, if something’s broken anyway, how much worse can I really make it
   by trying to fix it? It’s not like knitted things will suddenly burst
   into flames if my darning is a little crappy, right?

   **Students are always surprised to find that Lucy’s feast with Mr
   Tumnus breaks all the rules of rationing. They have real butter and
   eggs and toast – a huge indulgence for an afternoon snack – and this
   excess marks Mr Tumnus out as a strange and perhaps slightly dodgy
   character.

             Sneaky peeks….jackets and skirts and shawls oh joy!

   Today is rainy and miserable so I thought I’d cheer myself up with some
   crafting updates.

   First up – progress on my Victorian walking jacket.

   It’s slow going – I’m finding it hard to get the back of the neck to
   sit right and the problem with pinning something on myself is that
   every time I reach up to put in a pin I either stab myself or the whole
   thing moves around and I’m left taking random tucks. My method has
   been:  *try it on, squint critically, take it off, baste like my life
   depends on it, try it back on, wince, take it back off, unpick. Repeat
   from *.

   I’m happy with bits of it. My embroidery has improved no end
   (considering I had zero embroidery skills at the start of the project,
   that’s not really very hard).  And the sleeves bring me joy. This may
   not look like very much to you but to me it is the pouffy sleeve of
   dreams (and of the late 1880s).
   Authentic 1880s style

   Buttons underneath

   If I can persuade someone to take better pictures I’ll post better
   pictures soon. Once I’ve finished wrestling with the lining anyhow. At
   the moment, the lining looks like it’s making a mad dash for freedom. I
   had a mad idea of wearing it to the Roehampton graduation ceremony next
   week but I’m not sure if it’s going to happen…maybe the elves will
   finish it if I leave it out overnight?

   Next Up: Vintage find of the week is this skirt kit.

   It cost me the princely sum of eight English pounds in a charity shop
   in Putney.  It’s a thing of wonder – mostly wondering where the hell it
   came from.  I haven’t been able to find out when Yorkshire Fine
   Woollens & Tweeds were producing these sort of kits or if there was a
   wide range of them.  There’s no company trading under that name now so
   I’ll have to do a but more investigating.  If anyone has any leads on
   skirt kits, please let me know!

   This is definitely going to become a skirt though – I’m thinking a sort
   of Miss Jean Brodie style thing. The kind of skirt you can wear on a
   sit-up-and-beg bicycle with a basket of fresh bread and terriers on the
   front. Or the kind of skirt that you wear with thick boots and a scowl.

   This past month, I’ve been taking part in a Terry Pratchett themed swap
   organised by Louise Hunt of Caithness Craft Collective and I’ve been
   busy getting a little package together for my swap partner.  I like
   listening to podcasts and audiobooks but I find I can’t use the sewing
   machine if I want to listen at the same time.[1] So over the last few
   weeks I’ve been doing a fair bit of knitting too – well, designing
   really. I’ve designed my first ever lace shawl.

   I’m ridiculously pleased with myself about this – it brings elements of
   Estonian lace and English mesh lace together and it’s inspired by…well,
   I can’t reveal that just yet.  This is just a sneaky peek after
   all. I’m in the process of writing up my scrawls into an actual pattern
   that I will publish on this blog soon.

               All Things Alice: What has she got in her pockets?

   July 5, 2015 / JaneSuzanneCarroll / Leave a comment

   Everyone’s gone Alice mad! It’s been 150 years since Lewis Carroll’s
   Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland was first published.  And on Saturday
   July 4^th it’s Alice’s Day in Oxford. In honour of this frabjous
   occasion I’m doing a series of posts about all things Alice…

   “The time has come,” the Walrus said, “to talk of many things:

   Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —

   of cabbages — and kings –“

   I’ve always loved the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter. It was
   funny and sad and appealed to a sense of what I now know is called
   Schadenfreude – the gleeful delight in someone else’s misery (in this
   case, the oysters).  Now that I’ve started researching material culture
   in children’s literature the litany of objects “shoes, and ships, and
   sealing-wax” is fascinating all over again.

   There are a lot of objects mentioned in Alice’s Adventures in
   Wonderland – from the jam jar she finds as she falls down the rabbit
   hole to the gloves the White Rabbit sends her to fetch.  But of all the
   things in the story, I find Alice’s thimble the most intriguing.

   caucus

   At the end of the Caucus Race, Alice is tasked with given out the
   prizes. She has a box of comfits and a thimble in her pocket (the only
   items she carries from the real world into Wonderland). She gives each
   of the creatures a comfit and she is awarded the thimble:

     “At last the Dodo said, ‘Everybody has won, and all must have
     prizes.’

     But who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of voices asked.

     ‘Why, she, of course,’ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
     finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out
     in a confused way, ‘Prizes! Prizes!’

     Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
     pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
     not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
     one a-piece all round.

     ‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.

     ‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely. ‘What else have you got
     in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.

     ‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.

     ‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.

     Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
     presented the thimble, saying ‘We beg your acceptance of this
     elegant thimble’; and, when it had finished this short speech, they
     all cheered.

     Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so
     grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of
     anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as
     solemn as she could.”

     Lewis Carroll Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865)

   But what is Alice doing with a thimble? Unless Alice has stolen it –
   and let’s assume she hasn’t because nothing in the text suggests it –
   we must conclude that this is indeed her thimble.

   Perhaps it isn’t really surprising that Alice has a thimble. After all,
   in the 19^th century girls were taught to sew at a very young age. Asa
   Briggs notes that 19^th century manufactures made thimbles especially
   for children and that thimbles could even be considered toys for little
   girls.[1]

   Needlework – both plain and fancy was a key element of a Victorian
   girl’s education. Children’s homes and orphanages focused on teaching
   needlework with the expectation that whether the children gained
   employment in private homes or in factories, needlework was an
   essential skill.

   The V&A’s collection includes a number of samplers produced by
   working-class and middle-class children.

   The sampler was the way to practice techniques and to show off the
   sewist’s repertoire, showing ‘samples’ of each stitch.

   Samplers were also a way of inculcating ‘feminine’ virtues in the young
   girl – the patience and attention to detail needed to produce a sampler
   were cultivated through the production of samplers. Many samplers
   include images of houses and gardens – ensuring a clear focus on the
   virtues of domesticity and the centrality of domestic life. Many other
   samplers, like the ones shown below, include didactic or moral verses
   that celebrate hard work, self-sacrifice, loyalty, diligence, piety,
   grace and, often, silence.

   But not all girls willingly parroted these verses. Some, like Elizabeth
   Parker, used their needles to record their true feelings.

   “As I cannot write I put this down simply and freely…”

   As Rozsika Parker argues, in The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the
   Making of the Feminine the sampler can become a site of subversion, of
   rebellion and self-determination.

   There is no mention of sewing or samplers in Alice’s Adventures in
   Wonderland – Alice does absolutely no needlework at all and when she
   picks up knitting-needles in Through the Looking-Glass they turn into
   oars in her hands.

   However, Carroll does make reference to a moral verse: Isaac Watt’s
   insipid “How doth the little Busy bee” which is exactly the kind of
   thing that young girls were encouraged to stitch into their samplers.

   Here’s the original:

     How doth the little busy Bee
          Improve each shining Hour,
     And gather Honey all the day
          From every opening Flower!

     How skilfully she builds her Cell!
          How neat she spreads the Wax!
     And labours hard to store it well
          With the sweet Food she makes.

     In Works of Labour or of Skill
          I would be busy too:
     For Satan finds some Mischief still
          For idle Hands to do.

     In Books, or Work, or healthful Play
          Let my first Years be past,
     That I may give for every Day
          Some good Account at last.

   And Carroll’s gleeful, subversive parody:

     How doth the little crocodile

     Improve his shining tail,

     And pour the waters of the Nile

     On every golden scale!


     ‘How cheerfully he seems to grin,

     How neatly spread his claws,

     And welcome little fishes in

     With gently smiling jaws!’

   I have never really thought about producing a sampler. I don’t think I
   have the patience necessary. If I ever do, I think I will stitch
   Carroll’s “How doth the little Crocodile”…

   Nevertheless, I have been practicing my embroidery lately because I’m
   embroidering the collar and lapels of the Victorian Walking Jacket

   You can find the first post in my series of All Things Alice here – the
   second, all about tea in Alice here – and the third, all about Alice’s
   Day right here.

   If you want to find out more about Victorian needlework, Caulfield and
   Saward’s Dictionary of Needlework gives you an idea of the range of
   needlework produced by the home-crafter in the 19th century.  Flora
   Klickmann’s The Little Girl’s Sewing Book (though published in 1915) is
   a good indication of how little girls were taught to sew and what kind
   of things they were encouraged to make (aprons and boxes for ribbons
   and pukey cushion covers with lambs on them)
