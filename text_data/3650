Information Letter #.21

   ASN continued its monitoring of the Flamanville 3 EPR reactor
   construction site and the various manufactured items intended for it.
   The significant points in 2018 and early 2019 are detailed below; ASN
   was particularly vigilant with regard to the processing of the
   deviations detected on the main secondary system welds and the
   continuation of the reactor start-up tests.

Flamanville EPR reactor

   On 9 and 10 April 2019, ASN convened its Advisory Committee for Nuclear
   Pressure Equipment (GP ESPN) concerning the approach proposed by EDF to
   deal with the deviations detected in welds on the main steam transfer
   pipes of the Flamanville EPR reactor. Representatives from the
   Flamanville CLI, the HCTISN, the ANCCLI and foreign safety regulators
   concerned by the construction of an EPR reactor attended this session
   as observers.

Auxiliary systems of the backup diesel generating sets for the EDF reactors

   In 2017, EDF notified a significant safety event concerning the failure
   to demonstrate the seismic resistance of the civil engineering anchors
   of the auxiliary systems of the backup diesel generating sets for its
   1300 MWe nuclear power reactors. ASN had rated this event level 2 on
   the INES scale.
