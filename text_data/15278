   A plant-based diet may reduce the incidence of cancer

   It takes almost 20 times less land to feed someone on a
   plant-based-diet, compared to a meat-eater

   The carbon footprint of a plant-based diet is about half that of a
   meat-lover’s

   20 servings of vegetables creates fewer greenhouse gas emissions than
