   Spain declared March 8th as Women’s Day, and it was met with an
   unprecedented strike in defense of their rights. I began this mural on
   March, 10. Spain is the leading country in the fight for women’s
   rights, and against gender violence, although much work remains to be
   done.
   Last year, 49 women died at the hands of their partners or ex-partners,
   which was an increase on 2016 when 44 were killed.
   With this image I wanted to pay tribute to women in hopes that people
   will continue to fight for gender equality and stop turning a blind
   eye. This mural resides in @errekaleorin Vitoria -Gasteiz in the Basque
   region of Spain. She stands over 2 stories high. 60 + hours went into
   this mural, through rough weather and some tough days. I am glad I
   pushed through it even though there were times where I myself wanted to
   walk away

   Project: “Local Critters” mural by non-profit
   V.U.R.T: http://vurtcreative.org

   Philadelphia is home to over 1.5 million people. All who live, work,
   and coexist Seamlessly. Often we forget or overlook the animals that
   also call this city home. “Local Critters” is a series of murals
   depicting these animals. The juxtaposition of painting these smaller
   inhabitants on such a large scale acts as a playful way to raise
   awareness of their presence in our environment.

   Animals have no political or religious ties, and the personification of
   such interesting creatures beautifully conveys what the “city of
   brotherly love” can call each other, neighbor.

   V.U.R.T’s mission is to inspire, unify, and renew urban communities
   through the power of public art and revitalization.

   TIC TAC NO
   Anamorphic land art on the grass field of the airport festival grounds
   in Venice Florida. For the 10th anniversary of the Chalkfestival we
   created a piece with environmental friendly chalk. Painted with rollers
   and a handheld garden sprayer with 5 artists in 4 days. The longest
   line in the artwork is 300 ft.
   Lead artist and design: Leon Keer.
   Other artists: Massina, Sjem Bakkus, Ives One and Eric Keer.

   Title : “Dream”
   We should take more care of our lives and never forget to dream, cause
   inside each dream there’s everything we are and everything we will be.
   I painted this wall in Pescara my adoptive city in Italy.
   The wall is located in Fontanelle, one of the poorest suburbs of the
   city. My wall is part of a biggest process of requalification of the
   area wanted by the city.
