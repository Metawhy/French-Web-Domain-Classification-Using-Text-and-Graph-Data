DIY Coffee Table & More

   January 6, 2019 chelseataylor926

   Let me just start off by saying my husband is the absolute best. Not
   only is he a great husband but he is the most handy person I know. He
   built half of the tables and wall shelves/ bookcases in our house. ü§© I
   will start off by saying I do not know the exact measurements of his
   work. But, if anyone is interested just let me know.

   Here is our coffee table. [img_3130.jpg?w=1086] It is very sturdy and I
   love that it has the shelf underneath so I can keep my photo albums
   where I can always grab one when I‚Äôm bored. We get all of our lumber
   from Home Depot. I know that we used 1x4s and a Dark Walnut stain.
   [img_3132.jpg?w=1086] My cowhide rug came from Overstock.com and it is
   about a 5√ó7 rug. No two cowhide rugs are the same and that is why I
   love them so much!

   [img_3136.jpg?w=1086] lastly I wanted to share these super cute
   succulents that I snagged from TJ Maxx of course! Here is a link for
   the cutest little succulent tree! I know this has nothing to do with my
   husbands handy work. But they were too cute not to share!

DIY Craft Desk: Update with Chair

   January 6, 2019January 6, 2019 chelseataylor926

   It‚Äôs definitely been a long time coming for this update, almost 2
   years! To be honest I just completely forgot. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But, we‚Äôre here now
   so that‚Äôs all that matters. After I built my craft desk I was in
   desperate need of a chair that was bar height. Mainly because I used
   the storage cubes and it made my desk a little taller than a desk would
   normally be. I found the most adorable cow print chair that was
   PERFECT! (Not real cow hide)

   [img_3139.jpg?w=1086] The it measures about 22 inches tall, so it is
   not the same height as the bar stools I have in my kitchen, this is a
   tinier version which worked perfect for me! I will add the link here.
   It‚Äôs also on sale right now at Overstock.com for only $99. Mine came
   unassembled but it was super easy to put together, all I had to do was
   screw the legs into the seat of the chair and I was ready to go!

   [img_3138.jpg?w=1086] It was the perfect addition to my little craft
   space and I could not be happier. I also love that it has the little
   foot rail on the front part of the chair so I can rest my feet there. I
   am short so my feet don‚Äôt touch the ground if I‚Äôm sitting all the way
   back against the chair.

   I love making little projects on my Cricut Explore. It is also on sale
   at Walmart.com for only $130. That is a great deal, go get one now. You
   will not be disappointed, I use it for literally everything. I make
   vinyl decals and stickers, iron on decals, birthday cards, Christmas
   cards, signs, paper cut outs for other crafts, and so much more.

   [img_3137.jpg?w=1086] Once again my ‚ÄúBlessed‚Äù sign came from
   Kirkland‚Äôs. Right now I do not believe they have this exact style
   anymore, but I will put a link here for a super cute wall art piece
   from TJ Maxx.

   More to come!

Running ‚Äì My Journey ‚Äì Favorite Items

   December 19, 2018January 15, 2019 chelseataylor926

   I want to share some of my favorite running items. The main focus being
   on my running pants and my shoes.

   About a year ago I became a semi-serious runner. I have participated in
   about 20 timed races, one of them being a 10k and two of them being
   half-marathons üòÆ. Consistency in training is definitely the key when it
   comes to preparing for a half marathon. 13 miles is a long way to run
   especially if you‚Äôre new to running. [img_1995.jpg?w=1086] This photo
   was after my first 10k (6.2 miles). It was the biggest milestone for me
   because for years the longest I had ran in one stretch was 3 miles. My
   absolute FAVORITE running shoes are Brooks. I have the Launch 5 (in
   photo ^) and Ghost 11. They are the only shoes I can wear running that
   doesn‚Äôt hurt my feet. Here is a link for them on Zappos., they come in
   a lot of colors and they are on sale right now!! I have them in the
   pink/blue and gray/white.

   My two half-marathons were for the most part uneventful, other than my
   muscles feeling like they were dead the next day üòÇ. I ran a local race
   called Heart and Sole and then the St. Jude race in Memphis, TN. Even
   if you can‚Äôt run I suggest at least walking in the St. Jude Marathon
   weekend for the experience alone. In that one day we raised almost
   $3,000,000!

   [img_2254.jpg?w=1086] This is my husband, who met me at the finish
   line. It made me so much more proud to see him waiting for me! My
   favorite running pants which are pictured came from Target and they are
   the style EMBRACE. They are compression leggings so they hold you in
   really tight. And they have pockets on both sides! üòçüòçüòç Get them NOW.

   I am trying to get my sister, Kayla into running as well. I have forced
   her to participate this past year in a few races and then she did the
   5k for St.Jude as well, I am so proud of her! ( she kept her hat on the
   whole time‚Ä¶I had to throw mine away it was making me sweat more )

   [img_2864.jpg?w=1086] [img_2805.jpg?w=1086] I am also wearing my
   favorite leggings again from Target. This time they are the longer
   version of the EMBRACE training legging

   More to come! Maybe I will do a post on my weight loss journey üòâ

DIY Craft Desk

   May 18, 2017December 19, 2018 chelseataylor926

   Well‚Ä¶ when you can‚Äôt find anything like what you had in mind for a new
   desk for your workspace what do you do? YOU MAKE YOUR OWN!!!  This is
   super easy!!  I bought 2 storage cubes from Walmart.com (better homes
   and garden brand.) I LOVE them, they are super sturdy and SUPER cute!
   For the top I just got four 2x8s, link here for Home Depot. I bracketed
   them together on the bottom side and then I stained the wood with a
   dark walnut stain. Viola!!  A super cute and functional desk, handmade
   in less than an hour.. I decided against putting any type of top coat
   like polyurethane because i liked the look of it without anything on
   it. Plus I was afraid if i did a top coat it would make it feel
   ‚Äústicky‚Äù and my vinyl/other work would stick to it to often.

     The wicker storage cubes came from Target. and my ‚ÄúBlessed‚Äù sign came
   from kirklands.com here !!  I have ordered my new desk chair. I cannot
   wait for it to get here!!!


   More to come. üòä

Let the Blogging Begin

   May 1, 2017June 2, 2019 chelseataylor926

   IMG_0812
   I am brand new to all of this, but I wanted to give it a shot and see
   how it all plays out. My name is Chelsea and I love ALL things craft
   related. I have scrapbooked since I was in high school. I have recently
   found a love for painting and I got a
   Cricut//ap.lijit.com/www/delivery/fp?z=465463  for Christmas this year.
   So naturally everything and everyone is getting monograms and
   t-shirts!!  ü§ó I also like to organize things, I may or may not be a tad
   bit OCD. But, hey, that‚Äôs okay!!  It helps me get things done and
   that‚Äôs all that matters.

   I am married to my high school sweetheart, we have been together for
   almost 13 years, married for 2 years! We have 2 chocolate labs, Junior
   & Gauge, they are the sweetest puppers in the world.  IMG_0163.JPG

   I cannot wait to figure this out more and start posting tutorials on
   things I‚Äôve done!
