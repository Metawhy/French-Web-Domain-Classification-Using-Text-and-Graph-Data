How do Community College Students Perform at Elite Universities?

   By Alyssa Walker January 28, 2019

   College acceptances and rejections aren't as cut-and-dry as they seem.
   The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping
   exceptionally promising students in financial need, recently published
   a report which found that students who get admitted to elite and
   selective schools tend to do well and graduate within four years --
   including community college students.

   In fact, the report showed that community-college student transfer
   graduation rates either meet or exceed those of students who enroll at
   more elite schools on their first go-around. Their graduation rates are
   also higher than those who transfer from other four-year schools.

Courses

   Courses are units of higher education learning that last up to one
   academic year. There are courses in a wide variety of subjects, from
   cosmetology to engineering, food and beverage studies to law and
   regulations, biology to fashion. Serving a multitude of purposes for
   different students, courses are sometimes used to bridge the gap
   between different phases of academic study, or to provide additional
   professional training and qualifications.

Certificates

   A Certificate program teaches students a specific skillset or prepares
   students to succeed on a qualification exam. Academic programs to
   achieve a certificate normally take up to one year to complete. Some
   students require a certificate to demonstrate understanding of a topic
   in order to move forward in their careers. A certificate confirms that
   a student has received specialized training in a field.

Diplomas

   A diploma is a higher education qualification offered by community
   colleges, technical schools and some universities around the world.
   One- to two years of full time study is typically required for a
   diploma. A diploma program can provide valuable specialized skills,
   knowledge and experiences. Diplomas can help bridge the gap between
   secondary school and university, or between undergraduate and graduate
   study.

Associate Degrees

   Associate degrees are usually two-year degrees that are offered at
   junior colleges, universities, technical schools and community
   colleges. In some countries, an associate degree is equivalent to the
   first two years of a bachelor’s degree. Graduates from associate degree
   programs have demonstrated their understanding of fundamental concepts
   in their area and are qualified to start their professional career or
   continue their education at university.

Preparatory Year

   A preparatory year can prepare high school or secondary school
   graduates for their entry into university. Preparatory year programs
   may work well for older students as well. Preparatory year programs are
   available at universities across Europe, North America and Asia.
   Providing a smooth transition into university, preparatory year courses
   tend to provide general education that is useful or required in a
   four-year degree

Summer Courses

   Summer Courses are a way to build up valuable academic qualifications
   during the summer holidays. Universities and schools around the world
   offer summer courses both for full time students who would like to
   finish their degree sooner and new students looking for an exciting
   learning opportunity. There are summer courses available in almost any
   academic discipline and at any level.
