Increasing the chances of surviving cancer through early detection

   The earlier cancer is detected the higher the chance that it can be
   successfully treated, often at lower costs and with fewer side effects
   for patients. Among the 18 million new cancer cases in 2018, nearly 5
   million cases could have been detected and treated earlier, says the
   International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

   CANSEARCH Foundation

   The CANSEARCH Foundation, created in 2011 by Prof. Marc Ansari, head of
   the Paediatric Oncology Haematology Unit at Geneva University Hospitals
   (HUG), supports research projects on childhood cancers and blood
   diseases, and seeks to improve the understanding and treatment of these
   diseases. A research platform in this specific issue was set up in
   Geneva, with the collaboration of the HUG and the Faculty of Medicine
   of the Geneva University. Its research focuses on different types of
   cancer in children: leukaemia, neuroblastoma, liver cancer and brain
   tumours, as well as stem cell transplants and side effects. In Geneva,
   it offers a medicine of excellence, personalised and highly
   specialised. The use of individualised therapies based on genetics
   reduces the toxicity of drugs and thus side effects, improving survival
   and quality of life in the long term.

Further services

Disclosure of Personal Data

   We may disclose your personal data to the following recipients and for
   the following purposes:
     * To our service providers; these service providers, sub-contractors
       and subsidiaries include providers of information technology,
       identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis,
       data back-up, security and storage services;
     * If you expressly request us to do so;
     * If the disclosure is necessary to comply with a court order or a
       legal or regulatory requirement; or
     * We may from time to time disclose contact information between
       members as part of our membership services to put them in touch
       with each other.

   Our service providers may be located outside the country where a
   visitor is located. As a result, a visitor’s information may be
   transferred outside the country where they are located. All our service
   providers are contractually bound to process personal data only on our
   behalf and in accordance with our instructions. We also oblige them to
   comply with technical and organisational measures ensuring the
   protection and security of personal data. If a service provider is
   located in a country where the applicable laws do not provide an
   adequate level of protection for personal data, we will ensure by
   appropriate means that the respective data recipients maintain such
   adequate level of data protection.

   The third parties will only use personal data for the agreed purpose
   and not sell it to third parties or market it otherwise.

Security and Confidentiality

   To ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data collected
   online, we use data networks protected, inter alia, by industry
   standard firewall and password protection. In the course of handling
   your personal data, we take measures reasonably designed to protect
   such data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
   alteration or destruction.

Social Plug-ins

   Our Site contains links to the external social networks such as
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn and you may share on
   social networks the content of our Site.

   This Site uses a safe sharing tool which establishes a direct contact
   between the social networks and users only after users click on one of
   the respective buttons. This tool does not automatically transfer user
   data to the operators of such platforms. If users are logged into one
   or more of the social networks, the use of social buttons for Facebook,
   Twitter, etc. will display an information window in which the user can
   confirm the text before it is sent. The user can share the content of
   this Site on social networks without their providers creating profiles
   of users’ surfing behavior.

Cookies

   Cookies are text files placed on your device to help analyze how you
   use our Site. After the browser session, most of the cookies we use are
   deleted from your device (session cookies). Other cookies remain on
   your device (permanent cookies) and permit its recognition at your next
   visit to our Site. This allows us to better serve you with tailored
   information and to facilitate your on-going access to, and use of, the
   Site. If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, you can manage
   and control them through your browser, including removing cookies by
   deleting them from your 'browser history' (cache) when you leave the
   Site. Please note that deactivating cookies may affect your browsing
   experience.

Google Analytics

   This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
   Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the Site
   analyse how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie
   about your use of the Site will be transmitted to and stored by Google
   on servers in the United States and stored there. In case of activated
   IP anonymization on this Site, however, your IP address is previously
   truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in
   other states which are party to the agreement on the European Economic
   Area. Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address transmitted to a
   Google server in the United States and truncated there. On our behalf,
   Google will use this information to evaluate your use of our Site,
   compile reports about Site activities, and provide us with further
   services related to Site and Internet usage. The IP address sent from
   your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data
   by Google. You can prevent storage of cookies by appropriately setting
   your browser software; in this case, however, please note that you
   might not be able to fully use all functions offered by our Site. In
   addition, you can prevent data generated by the cookie and relating to
   your use of our Site (including your IP address) from being collected
   and processed by Google, by downloading and installing a browser
   plug-in from the following link:
   http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

   This Site uses Google Analytics with the extension "anonymizeIP()"; IP
   addresses are therefore truncated before further processing in order to
   rule out direct associations to persons.

Your Rights

   We will delete the personal data collected about you if all processing
   purposes have been fulfilled unless statutory retention obligations
   apply.

   You have the right to request access to, or transfer of, the personal
   data we process about you, to request correction of any incorrect
   personal data, restriction of access to, and deletion of, personal
   data, always to the extent these rights are granted by applicable.
   Furthermore, if you believe that your rights granted by applicable data
   protection laws have been infringed, you may lodge a complaint with the
   competent data protection authority.

Collection and Use of Personal Data

   When accessing our Site, the following data is stored in log files:
   Your IP address, date and time of your access, browser request and
   general information about your operating system and browser. This usage
   data forms the basis for statistical, anonymous analysis in order to
   identify trends to further improve our Site and our offers accordingly
   and to enhance your experience when visiting our Site.

   Most areas of our Site do not require any form of registration or the
   provision of specific personal data. You may need to provide limited
   personal data in order to receive certain information and services from
   us. If you provide personal data about other people - for example, your
   family or other authorised representatives, we rely on you to tell
   those people that you are giving their personal data to us and to make
   them aware of this Privacy Notice to the extent relevant.

   For example, the following services require registration:
     * News subscription

   You can sign up for news and updates by email where such service is
   provided on the Site. Only basic personal data, such as your name,
   address and email address are needed for registration.

   For verification purposes, we will send you a confirmation email
   immediately after you have finished the registration process. During
   this process, we may also store your IP address and the date and time
   of registration. The personal data collected as part of your
   registration will be used for sending you our news and/or other
   updates.

   Our newsletters contain tracking pixels which enable log file recording
   for statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. We may see
   whether and when an email was opened, and which links in the email were
   activated. We use Mailchimp, The Rocket Science Group, LLC 675 Ponce de
   Leon Ave NE Suite 5000. Atlanta, GA 30308 USA as our email marketing
   service. We only store your email address for email marketing services.

   You may opt out from receiving any, or all, of these communications
   from us by contacting us via privacy@uicc.org or by following the
   unsubscribe link or instructions in any email we send you. Please note
   that changes may not become effective immediately.
     * Contact form and emails

   You may use a contact form (where provided) in order to ask questions
   about us or our products and services. When using the contact form, you
   will be asked to provide personal data such as your name and email
   address and a message you want to deliver to us. You may also contact
   us by writing to us directly via email where we have provided a
   specific email address. We may use such information to get in touch
   with you or to reply to your message.
     * Apply for membership form

   join UICC as a member organisation and benefit from our services. When
   using the form, you will be asked to provide personal data such as your
   name and email address and information about your organisation. We may
   use such information to get in touch with you about your application.
   If you provide personal data about other people - for example, your

   inform those people that you are providing their personal data to UICC
   and to make them aware of this Privacy Notice to the extent relevant.

   publicise an event you are involved in / organising. When using the
   event submission form, you will be asked to provide personal data such

   (including its location). Please note that this information will be
   published on the website and that we (and others) may use such
   information to get in touch with you about the event submission or the
   event.
     * Surveys

   Occasionally, we conduct surveys via our Site or third party tools
   (such as SurveyMonkey). In addition to your opinion or feedback, you
   may be asked to provide personal data. The type of data collected
   depends on the survey; we will use the data only as indicated in the
   survey.
     * Events

   You can attend our events and subscribe online to calendar alerts
   sending a notification to your email address when a particular event is
   due, where such service is provided on the Site. You can unsubscribe
   from an alert at any time on the same page of the Site. Where
   registration is necessary, we enable it via our Site or the websites of
   third parties. In such case, personal data may be collected through the
   registration forms for events; the type of collected data depends on
   the event. We may forward the personal data of registered persons in
   connection with an event to third parties, such as, among others,
   hotels, sponsors, hosts, or organizers (including those accessed via
   the websites of third parties). Depending on the type of event, we may
   offer an Event App that will be used to facilitate your participation
   and networking at the event. In this case, your personal data may be
   used to create your account in the App, hosted by a third party but
   administered by UICC.

   If you are interested in working with us and would like to apply for an
   open position, you will be asked to submit your application to

   process and discarded once the position is filled.

   Vacancies are posted on uicc.org/who-we-are/employment. Spontaneous
   applications will be stored in our systems for 6 months. Data will be
   discarded after that.

   Personal information is not shared with any third parties.

Further services

Disclosure of Personal Data

   We may disclose your personal data to the following recipients and for
   the following purposes:
     * To our service providers; these service providers, sub-contractors
       and subsidiaries include providers of information technology,
       identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis,
       data back-up, security and storage services;
     * If you expressly request us to do so;
     * If the disclosure is necessary to comply with a court order or a
       legal or regulatory requirement; or
     * We may from time to time disclose contact information between
       members as part of our membership services to put them in touch
       with each other.

   Our service providers may be located outside the country where a
   visitor is located. As a result, a visitor’s information may be
   transferred outside the country where they are located. All our service
   providers are contractually bound to process personal data only on our
   behalf and in accordance with our instructions. We also oblige them to
   comply with technical and organisational measures ensuring the
   protection and security of personal data. If a service provider is
   located in a country where the applicable laws do not provide an
   adequate level of protection for personal data, we will ensure by
   appropriate means that the respective data recipients maintain such
   adequate level of data protection.

   The third parties will only use personal data for the agreed purpose
   and not sell it to third parties or market it otherwise.

Security and Confidentiality

   To ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data collected
   online, we use data networks protected, inter alia, by industry
   standard firewall and password protection. In the course of handling
   your personal data, we take measures reasonably designed to protect
   such data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
   alteration or destruction.

Social Plug-ins

   Our Site contains links to the external social networks such as
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn and you may share on
   social networks the content of our Site.

   This Site uses a safe sharing tool which establishes a direct contact
   between the social networks and users only after users click on one of
   the respective buttons. This tool does not automatically transfer user
   data to the operators of such platforms. If users are logged into one
   or more of the social networks, the use of social buttons for Facebook,
   Twitter, etc. will display an information window in which the user can
   confirm the text before it is sent. The user can share the content of
   this Site on social networks without their providers creating profiles
   of users’ surfing behavior.

Cookies

   Cookies are text files placed on your device to help analyze how you
   use our Site. After the browser session, most of the cookies we use are
   deleted from your device (session cookies). Other cookies remain on
   your device (permanent cookies) and permit its recognition at your next
   visit to our Site. This allows us to better serve you with tailored
   information and to facilitate your on-going access to, and use of, the
   Site. If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, you can manage
   and control them through your browser, including removing cookies by
   deleting them from your 'browser history' (cache) when you leave the
   Site. Please note that deactivating cookies may affect your browsing
   experience.

Google Analytics

   This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
   Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the Site
   analyse how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie
   about your use of the Site will be transmitted to and stored by Google
   on servers in the United States and stored there. In case of activated
   IP anonymization on this Site, however, your IP address is previously
   truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in
   other states which are party to the agreement on the European Economic
   Area. Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address transmitted to a
   Google server in the United States and truncated there. On our behalf,
   Google will use this information to evaluate your use of our Site,
   compile reports about Site activities, and provide us with further
   services related to Site and Internet usage. The IP address sent from
   your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data
   by Google. You can prevent storage of cookies by appropriately setting
   your browser software; in this case, however, please note that you
   might not be able to fully use all functions offered by our Site. In
   addition, you can prevent data generated by the cookie and relating to
   your use of our Site (including your IP address) from being collected
   and processed by Google, by downloading and installing a browser
   plug-in from the following link:
   http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

   This Site uses Google Analytics with the extension "anonymizeIP()"; IP
   addresses are therefore truncated before further processing in order to
   rule out direct associations to persons.

Your Rights

   We will delete the personal data collected about you if all processing
   purposes have been fulfilled unless statutory retention obligations
   apply.

   You have the right to request access to, or transfer of, the personal
   data we process about you, to request correction of any incorrect
   personal data, restriction of access to, and deletion of, personal
   data, always to the extent these rights are granted by applicable.
   Furthermore, if you believe that your rights granted by applicable data
   protection laws have been infringed, you may lodge a complaint with the
   competent data protection authority.

   For questions or queries please contact us at: privacy@uicc.org or
   write to Maria Barbara Leon, 31-33 Avenue Giuseppe-Motta, 1202 Geneva –
   Switzerland.

   We keep our Privacy Notice under regular review and may change it at
   any time. Your continued use of our Site and of our products and
   services is deemed as your acceptance with any such changes. Changes to
   the Privacy Notice will be communicated appropriately.
