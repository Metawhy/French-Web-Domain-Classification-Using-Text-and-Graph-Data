Netanyahu Didn’t Lose The Election on Election Night, And He Didn’t Just Win
It Now

   What on earth is going on in Israeli politics right now, explained

   meet at the President's Residence in Jerusalem on September 25,
   2019.(Amos Ben Gershom / GPO)

   This evening in Israel, President Reuven Rivlin officially tasked
   Benjamin Netanyahu with attempting to form a governing coalition. This
   has caused a lot of confusion among many people, some of whom thought
   Bibi had already lost the election, and others who seem to think that
   this news means he won it. Neither of these things are true. In fact,
   we still have no idea who won Israel’s election, and probably won’t for
   some time. Let me explain what’s going on.

   Didn’t Netanyahu already lose this election?

   No. Winning an election in a fractious parliamentary system like
   Israel’s is a lot more complicated than in the United States’s
   presidential system. For this reason, it can often take weeks before
   the victor is known, while the country waits to see which party leader
   can successfully form a coalition. Simply put, it’s not enough just to
   get the most votes for your party–you need to get most of the Knesset
   to back you. As I explained before the election:

     The Israeli Knesset is comprised of 120 seats, meaning a potential
     prime minister must control 61 of them to govern. This generally
     means cobbling together a coalition of their own party and several
     smaller ones. Typically, after an election, Israel’s president asks
     the leader of each party who they recommend as prime minister, and
     then gives first crack at forming a coalition to whoever gets the
     most support. If that person fails to form a coalition, the mandate
     is usually returned to the president, who then anoints another
     option.

     The method for winning an Israeli election, then, is two-fold: (1)
     Getting 61 seats for your bloc, (2) Being the biggest party of that
     bloc. The leader of that party then becomes prime minister.

   Neither Netanyahu’s Likud nor Benny Gantz’s Blue & White have fulfilled
   both victory conditions, so neither have won. In fact, both have blocs
   well under the 61 seats of support needed to control the Knesset: the
   pro-Bibi bloc is at 55 seats, while the anti-Bibi one is at 54. Rivlin
   just handed Netanyahu the first chance to assemble a government because
   he technically had one more seat of support than his opponent.

   But didn’t Gantz’s party get more votes than Netanyahu’s? Why isn’t he
   getting the first chance to form a coalition?

   It’s complicated. Gantz’s Blue & White received 33 Knesset seats to
   Likud’s 32. At the same time, as noted above, Netanyahu technically has
   one more seat of support in the Knesset, and there is no official rule
   that the biggest party gets the first chance to create a coalition. In
   fact, in Israel’s 2009 election, when Netanyahu first began his current
   term in office, Tzipi Livni’s center-left Kadima actually won one more
   seat than Bibi’s Likud. But Israeli President Peres nonetheless gave
   the first shot to Netanyahu because the right had a bigger ideological
   bloc overall in the Knesset, and thus the best chance of forming a
   coalition.

   The situation right now, however, is even more fraught. Likud has 32
   seats and Blue & White has 33, but neither have a real path to a
   coalition. The pro-Bibi bloc is 55, and the anti-Bibi bloc is 54. The
   reason for this deadlock is that Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the
   nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, has refused to endorse either side,
   and instead insisted that they serve together with him in a secular
   unity government that excludes the ultra-Orthodox parties, something
   that is anathema to Netanyahu. Without Leiberman’s swing vote of 8
   seats, neither Netanyahu nor Gantz can get to 61.

   Wait, I thought Gantz already had the bigger bloc thanks to the Arab
   parties?

   He did, and he didn’t.

   The anti-Bibi bloc’s current 54 seats is a bit of electioneering that
   may have been intentionally orchestrated. On September 22, Ayman Odeh,
   head of the Joint List alliance of predominantly Arab parties,
   announced that the List would recommend Benny Gantz as prime minister
   to President Rivlin. Initially, the Joint List said that all 13 of its
   seats were endorsing Gantz, even though its most extreme member Balad
   did not attend the meeting for the endorsement. This gave Gantz’s bloc
   57 to Bibi’s 55. The next day, however, after Blue & White’s people
   made clear that they preferred to attempt a coalition after Bibi, the
   List suddenly reversed course and announced that the party’s
   recommendation did not include Balad, which meant it only covered 10
   seats, which put Gantz at 54, one less than Bibi. There has been some
   speculation that this move was done in coordination with Blue & White
   to give Rivlin a reason to have them go second. (Update: Odeh has
   confirmed that he reduced the number of recommendations at Blue &
   White’s request, for exactly this reason.)

   Huh, what is the Israeli opposition thinking? Shouldn’t they want to go
   first?

   The opposition’s (risky) bet is that letting Netanyahu try and fail
   will significantly boost their own chances of success. Like last
   election, they are banking on the assumption that Netanyahu will fail
   to form a coalition, while this time, he will also have to go through
   his scheduled indictment hearing for corruption on October 3. By the
   time Blue & White gets their turn, Bibi will have both his coalition
   failure and indictment hanging over him, and the specter of extremely
   unpopular third elections looming. With lawmakers’ backs against the
   wall, the opposition will then have a much better chance at forming a
   coalition, either by getting Likud members to defect to their side,
   compelling Likud to depose Netanyahu, or getting the hobbled former
   prime minister to agree to more favorable terms.

   Couldn’t this backfire?

   Absolutely. Netanyahu is Israel’s most successful politician, and he is
   not only fighting for his political life, he may well be fighting for
   his freedom. (Under Israeli law, a Knesset member under indictment has
   to resign, but a prime minister does not.) He will promise the moon to
   lure any Knesset member or party who might join his government, from
   the center-left Labor-Gesher to the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu.

   Moreover, the opposition’s plan relies on Avigdor Lieberman, one of
   Israel’s most mercurial and mercenary politicians, to hold out and not
   cut a deal with Bibi. Last election, Lieberman did indeed refuse to
   cave to Netanyahu, and his refusal to join the latter’s coalition
   ultimately forced new elections. Blue & White hopes for a repeat
   performance, and if Lieberman wants to depose Bibi, his
   former-mentor-turned-nemesis, this will be his chance. But he might
   also simply use the opportunity to extort extraordinary power and
   positions from Netanyahu in exchange for his seats.

   Given this chaos, has Israel considered adopting a simpler and more
   straightforward system of government, like say, the electoral college?

   Not as yet.

   Why do hundreds of thousands of people around the world think Israel
   controls global politics when they can’t even govern themselves?

   Now, that’s a question even I can’t answer for you.

Netanyahu Didn’t Lose The Election on Election Night, And He Didn’t Just Win
It Now

   What on earth is going on in Israeli politics right now, explained

   meet at the President's Residence in Jerusalem on September 25,
   2019.(Amos Ben Gershom / GPO)

   This evening in Israel, President Reuven Rivlin officially tasked
   Benjamin Netanyahu with attempting to form a governing coalition. This
   has caused a lot of confusion among many people, some of whom thought
   Bibi had already lost the election, and others who seem to think that
   this news means he won it. Neither of these things are true. In fact,
   we still have no idea who won Israel’s election, and probably won’t for
   some time. Let me explain what’s going on.

   Didn’t Netanyahu already lose this election?

   No. Winning an election in a fractious parliamentary system like
   Israel’s is a lot more complicated than in the United States’s
   presidential system. For this reason, it can often take weeks before
   the victor is known, while the country waits to see which party leader
   can successfully form a coalition. Simply put, it’s not enough just to
   get the most votes for your party–you need to get most of the Knesset
   to back you. As I explained before the election:

     The Israeli Knesset is comprised of 120 seats, meaning a potential
     prime minister must control 61 of them to govern. This generally
     means cobbling together a coalition of their own party and several
     smaller ones. Typically, after an election, Israel’s president asks
     the leader of each party who they recommend as prime minister, and
     then gives first crack at forming a coalition to whoever gets the
     most support. If that person fails to form a coalition, the mandate
     is usually returned to the president, who then anoints another
     option.

     The method for winning an Israeli election, then, is two-fold: (1)
     Getting 61 seats for your bloc, (2) Being the biggest party of that
     bloc. The leader of that party then becomes prime minister.

   Neither Netanyahu’s Likud nor Benny Gantz’s Blue & White have fulfilled
   both victory conditions, so neither have won. In fact, both have blocs
   well under the 61 seats of support needed to control the Knesset: the
   pro-Bibi bloc is at 55 seats, while the anti-Bibi one is at 54. Rivlin
   just handed Netanyahu the first chance to assemble a government because
   he technically had one more seat of support than his opponent.

   But didn’t Gantz’s party get more votes than Netanyahu’s? Why isn’t he
   getting the first chance to form a coalition?

   It’s complicated. Gantz’s Blue & White received 33 Knesset seats to
   Likud’s 32. At the same time, as noted above, Netanyahu technically has
   one more seat of support in the Knesset, and there is no official rule
   that the biggest party gets the first chance to create a coalition. In
   fact, in Israel’s 2009 election, when Netanyahu first began his current
   term in office, Tzipi Livni’s center-left Kadima actually won one more
   seat than Bibi’s Likud. But Israeli President Peres nonetheless gave
   the first shot to Netanyahu because the right had a bigger ideological
   bloc overall in the Knesset, and thus the best chance of forming a
   coalition.

   The situation right now, however, is even more fraught. Likud has 32
   seats and Blue & White has 33, but neither have a real path to a
   coalition. The pro-Bibi bloc is 55, and the anti-Bibi bloc is 54. The
   reason for this deadlock is that Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the
   nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, has refused to endorse either side,
   and instead insisted that they serve together with him in a secular
   unity government that excludes the ultra-Orthodox parties, something
   that is anathema to Netanyahu. Without Leiberman’s swing vote of 8
   seats, neither Netanyahu nor Gantz can get to 61.

   Wait, I thought Gantz already had the bigger bloc thanks to the Arab
   parties?

   He did, and he didn’t.

   The anti-Bibi bloc’s current 54 seats is a bit of electioneering that
   may have been intentionally orchestrated. On September 22, Ayman Odeh,
   head of the Joint List alliance of predominantly Arab parties,
   announced that the List would recommend Benny Gantz as prime minister
   to President Rivlin. Initially, the Joint List said that all 13 of its
   seats were endorsing Gantz, even though its most extreme member Balad
   did not attend the meeting for the endorsement. This gave Gantz’s bloc
   57 to Bibi’s 55. The next day, however, after Blue & White’s people
   made clear that they preferred to attempt a coalition after Bibi, the
   List suddenly reversed course and announced that the party’s
   recommendation did not include Balad, which meant it only covered 10
   seats, which put Gantz at 54, one less than Bibi. There has been some
   speculation that this move was done in coordination with Blue & White
   to give Rivlin a reason to have them go second. (Update: Odeh has
   confirmed that he reduced the number of recommendations at Blue &
   White’s request, for exactly this reason.)

   Huh, what is the Israeli opposition thinking? Shouldn’t they want to go
   first?

   The opposition’s (risky) bet is that letting Netanyahu try and fail
   will significantly boost their own chances of success. Like last
   election, they are banking on the assumption that Netanyahu will fail
   to form a coalition, while this time, he will also have to go through
   his scheduled indictment hearing for corruption on October 3. By the
   time Blue & White gets their turn, Bibi will have both his coalition
   failure and indictment hanging over him, and the specter of extremely
   unpopular third elections looming. With lawmakers’ backs against the
   wall, the opposition will then have a much better chance at forming a
   coalition, either by getting Likud members to defect to their side,
   compelling Likud to depose Netanyahu, or getting the hobbled former
   prime minister to agree to more favorable terms.

   Couldn’t this backfire?

   Absolutely. Netanyahu is Israel’s most successful politician, and he is
   not only fighting for his political life, he may well be fighting for
   his freedom. (Under Israeli law, a Knesset member under indictment has
   to resign, but a prime minister does not.) He will promise the moon to
   lure any Knesset member or party who might join his government, from
   the center-left Labor-Gesher to the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu.

   Moreover, the opposition’s plan relies on Avigdor Lieberman, one of
   Israel’s most mercurial and mercenary politicians, to hold out and not
   cut a deal with Bibi. Last election, Lieberman did indeed refuse to
   cave to Netanyahu, and his refusal to join the latter’s coalition
   ultimately forced new elections. Blue & White hopes for a repeat
   performance, and if Lieberman wants to depose Bibi, his
   former-mentor-turned-nemesis, this will be his chance. But he might
   also simply use the opportunity to extort extraordinary power and
   positions from Netanyahu in exchange for his seats.

   Given this chaos, has Israel considered adopting a simpler and more
   straightforward system of government, like say, the electoral college?

   Not as yet.

   Why do hundreds of thousands of people around the world think Israel
   controls global politics when they can’t even govern themselves?

   Now, that’s a question even I can’t answer for you.
