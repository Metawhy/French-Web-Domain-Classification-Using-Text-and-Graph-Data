A Rocha Ghana Condemns Adom Tv For The Use Of Pangolins For Food

   It has come to our notice that organizers of the second edition of the
   popular ‘Adom TV Fufuo Party’ which took place on March 6, 2019,
   supervised the ‘Illegal’ use of PANGOLINS, an endangered and globally
   protected species for some of the local delicacies featured at the
   event.

   In a widely publicized video spotted by our team, two Pangolins,
   commonly known as ‘aprawa’— an endangered species, together with other
   animals had been stunned and displayed on a mat at the premises of the
   Multimedia Group—one of the largest independent commercial media and
   entertainment company in Ghana, during the event. One of the pangolins
   was clearly alive, while the other was dead, with blood all over its
   scales.

   ideo-2019-03-07-at-8.54.40-AM.mp4

   In as much as we love Adom Tv for their work on crucial social issues
   and the promotion of national culture, A Rocha Ghana condemns in no
   uncertain terms, the capture, and destruction of pangolins in the
   recently ‘Adom TV Fufuo Party’ held in Accra on Independence Day. The
   act which is widely published on Adom Tv Instagram page, and viewed by
   over 12,000 fans is in breach of the Wildlife Preservation Act 43 and
   its regulations in Wildlife Conservation Regulation L.I 685 and its
   Amendments. We therefore call for an investigation into activities that
   led to the display of a dead and a live pangolin, an endangered and
   wholly protected species in Ghana, at the ‘Adom TV Fufuo Party’.

   A Rocha Ghana finds it hard to believe that a well-respected media
   entity like Adom TV oversaw such illegality and particularly coming
   just three weeks, after the 16th of February, which was World Pangolin
   Day, where the hashtag #Stoppangolintrade was in the trends for two
   days running and the day carried by several media outlets.

   The feature and publicity of Adom TV which encouraged and endorsed the
   capture and destruction of pangolins is most unfortunate and erodes
   efforts in the last five years to minimize and eliminate the trade in
   pangolins.

   Remedial Action

   A Rocha Ghana uses this opportunity to invite Adom TV to remedy this
   impropriety and show true commitment to the fight against illegal
   pangolin hunting and trade by using its popular television and social
   media handles to support national efforts at addressing the pangolin
   hunting and trade in Ghana.

   A Rocha reiterates the fact that, the hunting, trade and destruction of
   pangolins is illegal and persons found culpable must be allowed to face
   the full rigorous of the law. A Rocha Ghana is firmly and resolutely
   committed to all necessary measures that will ensure Pangolins do not
   go into extinction. We are equally resolved to fight the menace of
   poaching and trading of the endangered species.

   We call on all well-meaning individuals and organizations to join the
   fight in ending pangolin trade in Ghana. Let’s work together to reduce
   consumer demand for these products through awareness campaigns. You can
   help by spreading the word on social media and always saying no to
   pangolin products.

   Facts about t he Pangolin

   Recent studies has found that about 400,000 pangolins are traded every
   year in Africa, with the trade increasing and no solution in site
   making it crucial for targeted awareness and dedicated law enforcement
   and compliance actions to secure this amazing creature.

   Out of the 8 species of Pangolins in the world, Ghana has 3 (Tree or
   African white-bellied pangolin, Giant ground pangolin and Long-tailed
   or black-bellied pangolin.

   According to the Wildlife Division of the Forestry Commission, the
   population of Pangolins in Ghana is not known. However, the species is
   wholly protected by national laws. There is an international protection
   for the species through the Convention on International Trade in
   Endangered Species (CITES, Appendix I) and thus, cannot be exported or
   hunted even for its meat which is a delicacy in Ghana. Our delicacy for
   bushmeat which is not bad itself is however driving our biodiversity to
   extinction leaving a lot of our forests empty of any wildlife. This is
   the time to change attitudes when they are against the laws of the
   state and threatens the co-existence of man and wildlife crucial for
   the development infrastructure of our nation.
