   It‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs done! Okay. I still need to find lamps for the dresser

   like to hang Roman shades on the window over the bed. But other than
   that (üòÇ), our master bedroom is DONE!

   Happy 125th Anniversary to Barbour! I‚Äôm doing an Instagram
   collaboration with the brand today, but I couldn‚Äôt help but share the
   photos on the blog, too. :) I mean, the Lucy pics?! (Note: Mitch is
   laying on the ground behind her for support. üòÇ)

   I‚Äôve had a Barbour for as long as I can remember, and I‚Äôm wearing it in
   so many of my happiest memories. And I meet a lot of people who say the
   same. But it‚Äôs no wonder! The iconic brand is deeply rooted in so many
   families; Barbour itself is a five-generation, family-owned business.

Fall Bucket List

   Children‚Äôs J.Crew Factory Cocoon Coat (Sold out, but I love the new
   girls‚Äô Chateau Coat. So cute! Looking for the adult version? Try
   J.Crew‚Äôs Cocoon Coat‚Äìwhich comes in pink!‚Äìor the J.Crew Factory New
   City Coat. FYI: The J.Crew version is considerably warmer, but they‚Äôre
   both great! Cocoon runs large.)

   Only one day late with this post! üòâ But HAPPY FALL. Mitch and I thought
   it would be fun to share some of the stuff we‚Äôre excited about doing
   this season. Fall is gorgeous in Chicago; the weather changes quickly,
   the air is crisp, and the leaves are vibrant. Of course, it means that
   winter is coming and that makes my heart sad, haha. But let‚Äôs push that
   to the backs of our minds right now and focus on these next three
   months, which are the best of the year!

   Here‚Äôs what we hope to do:

Kitchen Plans

   Photo credit: Missy Walsh from Capital Black Book

   During our home search, I personally placed a lot of importance on not
   having to undergo full bathroom and kitchen renovations. (I was about
   to have a baby, and was still a little traumatized from the renovations
   we lived through in our first home. üòú) Mitch was way more open to it,
   but the house we ended up with was a happy medium!

   With the exception of the powder room, we aren‚Äôt going to be making any
   big changes to the bathrooms. I love them‚Ä¶ and the powder room really
   only needs a new vanity and some wallpaper. No wall left un-papered! üòÇ
   As for the kitchen, we adore the cabinetry, and feel very lucky for
   that, since cabinets‚Äìin our experience‚Äìtend to be the most costly part
   of kitchen renovations!

   Over the next few weeks, though, we do plan on making a few updates.
   Here are the tentative plans:
