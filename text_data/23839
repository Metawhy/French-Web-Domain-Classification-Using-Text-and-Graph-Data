   A baby in 0.36μSv/h

   <Translate>

   Motomiya station now. A mother with her baby. It’s a beautiful view but
   the atmospheric dose is 0.36μSv/h. I only hope for the safety of the
   baby.

   After taking the picture, the dose became 0.40μSv/h.

   A freelance journalist reported from Motomiya station in Fukushima,
   where is 57km away from Fukushima plants.

   A baby in 0.36μSv/h

   <Translate>

   Motomiya station now. A mother with her baby. It’s a beautiful view but
   the atmospheric dose is 0.36μSv/h. I only hope for the safety of the
   baby.

   After taking the picture, the dose became 0.40μSv/h.

[Alert] All power’s been down in Fukushima plant for over 3 hours, Tepco
investigating the reason

   by Mochizuki , March 18, 2013

   Over 3 hours before this post, Fukushima plant lost power. (19:00 of
   3/18/2013)

   The coolant system of the spent fuel pools of reactor1, 3 and 4 has
   been out of operation for over 3 hours already.

   Seismic isolation building has lost power too. Tepco is still
   investigating the reason.

[Media Blackout] Fire in the approach ramp to Fukushima plant → Tepco didn’t
announce to the press

   by Mochizuki , January 29, 2014

   Note : Thank you for reading Fukushima Diary. Fukushima Diary is
   genuinely supported by your donation.Monthly recurring donation is also
   appreciated.



   There was a fire in the approach ramp to Fukushima plant in the morning
   of 1/29/2014. However, they only reported to NRA (Nuclear Regulation
   Authority) but didn’t publish the press release.

   The fire occurred at a bridge pier along the ramp. Tepco’s spokesman
   commented they didn’t publish the press release because it happened
   outside of the plant itself.

   Il y a eu un incendie à la rampe d’accès à la centrale de Fukushima au
   matin du 29 janvier 2014. Cependant, ils n’en ont parlé qu’à la NRA
   (Nuclear Regulation Authority) et sans communiqué de presse.

   L’incendie a eu lieu à une pile de pont de la rampe. Le porte-parole de
   Tepco a déclaré qu’ils n’ont pas communiqué dessus parce que ça s’est
   passé en dehors de l’enceinte de la centrale elle-même.
