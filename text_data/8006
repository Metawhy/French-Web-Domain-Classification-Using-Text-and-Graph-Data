Strawberry Feta Bruschetta

   Strawberry Feta Bruschetta Recipe | Entertaining ideas, party

   We had a whirlwind of a weekend, hosting two parties and inviting a
   combined total of over 60 people through the house over the last two
   days. This morning it is dark and stormy, and I rolled out of bed a
   solid hour later than usual. I guess 48 hours of intense back-to-back
   entertaining will do that to you! When we’re throwing parties my rule
   of thumb is to keep the food simple, but also a touch unexpected and
   fun. It makes people feel special and gets them really excited to try
   something new. This strawberry feta bruschetta recipe perfectly fits
   that bill! It’s a departure from the tomato-based classic, but it’s
   equally, if not more, delicious. Plus, strawberries and feta always
   taste amazing together. In terms of prep, it’s also very easy! If you
   can dice up berries, you can feel confident serving this bruschetta at
   your next get together.

   It’s Monday morning following an ice storm over the weekend, so the
   start to my week is looking a whole lot like big cups of coffee,
   sheltering in place for another 24 hours, and if I’m lucky, some extra
   snuggles with my kid. (And yes, it’s mid-April and we’re encased in
   ice.) While the little one sits next to me, armed with a stash of
   crayons and her favorite coloring book, let’s talk about avocado toast!
   I know, I know. There’s nothing revolutionary about avocado toast,
   which is becoming such a mainstay these days that it’s basically
   ubiquitous. But here’s the thing. We can’t stop eating it! When you
   have a two year old who is obsessed with avocados and her parents echo
   those sentiments, well, you buy a lot of avocados. Bob prefers his with
   tomatoes on top and a big pinch of coarse ground salt. If I’m keeping
   it simple, I like mine with a generous sprinkle of red pepper flake. If
   I’m keeping it real though, I love my avocado toast piled high with
   veggies and herbs and a little bit of interest to keep it fun. Today
   I’m sharing eight awesome ways to make the best avocado toast on earth.
   This certainly isn’t the first avocado toast round-up you’ve seen and I
   bet it won’t be the last, but I can guarantee all of these varieties
   are crazy delicious. What’s your favorite way to eat it? I have a
   kitchen full of avocados and marble rye bread and I’m ready to go!

   1. The Better Than Basic
   Here’s my quick and easy go-to way of making avocado toast! Whenever
   possible, if I’m eating bread it’s going to be marble rye or some other
   rye or pumpernickel variation. Because, delicious. I then scoop a bit
   of avocado on top, smash it with a fork (because I prefer that texture,
   but slices are obviously fine) and top everything with sea salt,
   freshly cracked black pepper and those red pepper flakes I love so
   much. Done and done!

   2. Grapefruit + Pomegranate
   When I told Bob I was going to put grapefruit and pomegranate on top of
   avocado, he may have looked at me like I was mildly insane. It turns
   out, as with most things, that I was right and it’s absolutely
   delicious. The creamy avocado, the tart grapefruit and the sweet
   pomegranate seeds are a match made in flavor heaven!

   3. Radish + Cucumber
   I think of this one as avocado toast for bunnies! A bit of salt and
   pepper on the smashed avocado followed by thin slices of cucumber and
   radishes on top and you’ve got a really great lunch option with this
   one, too. Plus it is so so tasty!

   4. Caper, Dill + Red Onion
   This one is my version of something resembling the bagels with lox,
   capers and onion of my dreams, but made entirely plant-based with the
   addition of fresh dill and lemon zest. This might just be my favorite
   of the whole bunch! I’m on such a kick with capers lately, I can’t get
   enough and this combination is crazy good.

   5. Shaved Zucchini + Scallions
   Have you ever eaten zucchini raw? I feel like it’s almost always
   cooked, but when it’s shaved (in this case with a simple veggie peeler)
   and stacked on top of avocado toast with sliced scallions, it’s a thing
   of beauty. It looks pretty fancy for serving to brunch guests, too!

   6. Strawberries + Balsamic Glaze
   You can probably already guess that this was another one where my
   husband decided I was straight up crazytown, but he loved it just as
   much as I do! Thin slices of strawberry with a big drizzle of balsamic
   glaze makes for a sensational piece of avocado toast. (Psst! I get
   asked this a lot, so look for ready-made balsamic glaze in the vinegar
   section of your grocery store!)

   7. Caprese Avocado Toast
   I’m a big fan of caprese anything and everything, (like this caprese
   salad board, yum!) because there’s just nothing better than tomatoes,
   fresh basil and good mozzarella. Stack said ingredients on your
   favorite avocado toast foundation and you surely will not be
   disappointed. (Interestingly, this is the only variation here that
   isn’t vegan! While it’s not something that I planned, we do eat a lot
   of plant-based meal so I love that it worked on that way!)

   8. Hummus + Avocado
   I may have just saved the best for last! This hummus and avocado take
   on avocado toast is just a slight variation on the classic basic, but
   it’s over the top good. I mix a big spoonful of hummus into my smash
   avocado, then layer on more sliced avocado, scallions and red pepper
   flake. This is for the mornings when your avocado craving is feeling a
   little extra.

Hosting a Photography Summer Camp

   Aug 29
   Photography Summer Camp | Summer Camp Ideas for Kids

   When I was a kid I always had a camera in my hand. I didn’t know then
   that photography was a career. Heck, the internet had yet to even be
   invented. But I would spend hours styling the wardrobe of my sister and
   my cousins, and then pose them in various scenes to take their photos.
   I loved every minute of fiddling with a camera.

How to Make a Seasonal Summer Harvest Cheese Board

   Aug 27
   Easy Party Appetizers: Summer Harvest Cheese Board from @cydconverse

   I’m pretty sure that a great cheese board makes the perfect party
   appetizer no matter the occasion. I’m convinced of it, in fact. In full
   disclosure, I actually think a cheese board makes the perfectly easy
   dinner, too! Just give me all the cheese, please. This cheese board is
   sort of an ode to late summer and the fruits and veggies spilling out
   of gardens and farmer’s market bins right now.

An Easy Summer Tomato Tart

   Aug 5
   An Easy Tomato Tart: Entertaining ideas, summer party ideas, easy
   summer recipes from @cydconverse

   I love an easy recipe for summer parties, easy weeknight dinners and
   just generally maximizing my time spent enjoying summer versus being
   tethered to the kitchen. This fuss-free tomato tart recipe is just such
   a dish! It makes the most of ripe tomatoes fresh from the garden or
   farmer’s market. It’s light, tasty and perfect for bringing to a summer
   potluck.

Mediterranean Orzo Salad with Feta

   Jul 29
   Easy Mediterranean Orzo Salad with Feta

   This Mediterranean orzo salad with feta is owning summer in our house.
   I can’t stop making it, my family and friends basically beg for it, and
   after a bunch of tweaking and experimenting, this orzo salad is damn
   near perfection. Also, it’s really really easy to make.

Real Talk with Real Moms: How We’re Raising Kids without Religion

   Jun 28

   In nearly 11 years of blogging, I’ve never talked about matters of
   spirituality or religion. Today I am excited to dive into it a bit as
   part of the next installment of our Real Talk with Real Mom series.
   Today we’re all chatting about religion, spirituality and how it
   relates to parenting. Are you raising your kids with religion? I am not
   and I thought I would share a bit about why.
