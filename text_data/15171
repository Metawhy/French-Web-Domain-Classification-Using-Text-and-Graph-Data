[m]PLATFORM Privacy Notice

   This is the global mPlatform privacy policy. Please read our EU and
   language specific versions here.

   Effective Date: May 25, 2018

   [m]PLATFORM Privacy Notice

   This Privacy Notice describes the information [m]PLATFORM collects from
   web sites, applications, and other digital properties, we refer to all
   of these as “Sites”. We explain how we use this information in our
   “Platform” and to provide “Services” to our clients. We also explain
   how you can manage your privacy choices and exercise your rights in
   relation to certain data about you collected and used by [m]PLATFORM.

   Who are we?

   [m]PLATFORM is a business which operates globally as part of the GroupM
   group of companies. In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland
   the [m]PLATFORM legal entity responsible for the data that [m]PLATFORM
   collects is [m]PLATFORM Ltd.  Outside of the EEA and Switzerland the
   responsible legal entity is mPlatform, LLC.

   [m]PLATFORM is GroupM’s audience intelligence and activation solution
   that builds personalized consumer relationships at scale. In addition
   to the technology suite, it is a worldwide service organization
   comprised of analysts, data strategists, search and social specialists,
   and product and media experts focused on ensuring consistent delivery
   in all markets where our clients do business.

   If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Notice,
   please see the “Contact us” section at the bottom of this Privacy
   Notice. Please note that this Privacy Notice has been translated from
   English into multiple different languages. If there are any conflicts
   or inconsistencies between the different language versions of this
   Privacy Notice, the English version will prevail.

   What are our Services?

   [m]PLATFORM owns and operates a technology platform (the “Platform”)
   that provides various advertising-related services (collectively,
   “Services”) for its clients, which consist of other GroupM agencies and
   businesses as well as other companies within the WPP plc group of
   companies. [m]PLATFORM does not provide services directly to consumers,
   our clients are corporate businesses who work with GroupM agencies to
   plan and buy media campaigns (advertising).

   GroupM agencies use our Platform and Services, for their own clients,
   to help them to understand the advertising that the clients deliver
   online (e.g. what sites it was delivered on, who saw it and whether or
   not anyone interacted with it) and to improve the effectiveness of that
   advertising and we also help them to try deliver advertising to
   consumers who are more likely to be interested in their products and
   services.

   When we help clients to select audiences to deliver their advertising
   to, we use certain demographic information (such as age, gender,
   education, income and household status (e.g., number of children)),
   geography, interests, activities, and similar information (“User
   Information”). We explain below where this information comes from. We
   call this type of advertising “Interest-Based Advertising”.

    What information is collected and utilized by [m]PLATFORM?

   The Platform is designed to collect and/or use information about the
   type of web pages that individuals visit and about interactions that
   they have with Sites and with our clients’ advertisements. We also
   collect information that identifies the browsers and devices of the
   individuals who have viewed our clients’ advertising. This information
   includes the following categories of data:

   Technical Identifiers

   These can be used to identify an individual’s browser, mobile
   advertising environment, and/or device, and typically include:
     * Cookie IDs
     * Mobile advertising IDs (e.g., IDFAs and Google Advertising IDs)
     * [m]PLATFORM’s “[mP]ID” proxy identifier for the above IDs


   Additional Technical Information
     * Internet protocol address (“IP address”) and data derived from an
       IP address, such as non-precise geolocation data that indicates the
       country, region, city, and/or postal code of a device
     * Type of Internet browser, browser language, and operating system
     * Connection type (wired or Wi-Fi), network to which the device is
       connected, and mobile carrier (if available)
     * Latitude/longitude of a (mobile) device.  For purposes of this
       Privacy Notice, “mobile device” includes smartphones and tablet
       computers.


   Online Activity Information

   [m]PLATFORM collects the information explained below about your online
   browsing activity to determine what types of activities, services and
   products you and other users may be interested in and how you and other
   users interact with certain advertisements. This information includes:
     * Records of the type of Sites and pages viewed (i.e., in order to
       ascertain interests)
     * Site/page you came from before, and visited after, viewing an
       advertisement
     * Date and time of online activity
     * Frequency of visits to a Site
     * Search terms used on a Site
     * Interaction with an advertisement (e.g., whether a user clicks on
       an advertisement)


   User Information received from Third Parties

   We also receive both online and offline User Information collected by
   third parties, including demographic and interest information for use
   in our Services. The third parties include our clients and carefully
   selected service providers.  When we receive offline User Information,
   this information is provided to us via a service provider in
   conjunction with a cookie ID, advertising ID, or similar user ID that
   identifies a customer or consumer to us, the client or service
   provider, but we do not receive any names, mailing addresses, phone
   numbers, email addresses or similar data that would enable
   identification of a particular individual connected with these IDs.

   How do we collect information?

   We collect information and receive information on behalf of our clients
   about individuals when you visit the online properties of our clients
   for whom [m]PLATFORM provides services, or third-party publishers (for
   example, news sites). In order to do this we use cookies, advertising
   IDs, pixels, and other technologies. Here are some explanations of
   these terms:

   Cookie

   is a small alphanumeric text file that is stored in a browser by a web
   site or by a third-party ad server or other third party which allows
   that web site or third party to recognize that browser and remember
   User Information and other information. Our targeting cookies, which
   are named “Mookie” and operate on the mookie1.com domain, are
   persistent cookies that contain unique randomly-generated values that
   enable our Services to distinguish browsers and devices and are
   associated with User Information and other information. Mookie cookies,
   together with this associated information, are used in the performance
   of our Services, and in particular Interest-Based Advertising
   activities. More information about our Mookie cookies is set forth in
   the table immediately below this explanation of terms.

   Advertising ID

   is an alphanumeric identifier made available by a platform or operating
   system (such as Apple iOS or Google Android) that allows application
   developers and third parties to recognize a particular device in an
   application environment. It is associated with User Information and
   other information and, together with this associated information, is
   used in the performance of our Services, and in particular
   Interest-Based Advertising activities.

   Pixel

   is a line of code that is used by a Site or third party to assign
   online activities to a device or browser, or more specifically to the
   applicable cookie or advertising ID. The use of a pixel allows us to
   record, for example, that a device or browser has visited a particular
   Site or page.

   The following chart provides information about our Mookie cookies, all
   of which are “persistent” cookies (meaning they are stored until they
   expire or are deleted/removed by a user) mapped to the mookie1.com
   domain:

                                 Cookie Name

                         Cookie Behaviour Capability

   [m]PLATFORM processes the information it collects and receives for the
   purposes of providing the Services to clients which we have explained
   above, as well as for administrative, security and compliance purposes.
   Specifically, we carry out the following activities:

   How do we use this information?

   Ad Selection, Delivery, Reporting

   We analyze the information collected when client advertising is
   delivered through [m]PLATFORM and information received from our
   partners. We organize this information into collections of IDs (which
   we call segments), based on various components of the User Information
   we explained above.  For example, we may have segments of IDs that
   visit sport websites. GroupM agencies then use these segments within
   our platform to deliver Interest-Based Advertising for their clients,
   using our partners and service providers. This advertising may be
   delivered across computers, phones, and other mobile devices.

   We may also integrate (and use for the same purposes) User Information
   obtained from other carefully selected companies (including Site
   owners, data providers and data aggregators).

   We also maintain our own internal identifier, which we call “[mP]ID”.
   We use the [mP]ID to associate information relating to browsers,
   environments, and/or devices that we reasonably believe belong to the
   same user. This helps us to provide more useful and relevant
   advertising to a specific user, regardless of the browser, device, or
   environment.

   Personalization

   In order to provide our client-specific personalization Services, we:
     * collect information on each client’s Sites (this includes websites,
       apps, and other digital properties) – as described above in “How we
       collect information”;
     * access or store this information on devices (via cookie IDs and
       advertising IDs, as applicable); and
     * analyze the information collected, sometimes with other information
       received from the client and organize it into segments of IDs,
       based on the various User Information we have

   Our clients can then use these segments to deliver, on their own behalf
   or on behalf of their clients, Interest-Based Advertising to users on
   their computers, phones, and other mobile devices (this is through a
   variety of means).

   Where we are providing this client-specific personalization, the
   segments that we build for one client are logically segregated from the
   segments and data of other clients. Data collected in this way, and the
   segments produced, can only be used on behalf of that specific client.

   Measurement

   We process User Information to deliver advertisements and measure the
   delivery of these advertisements, to learn about what factors make
   advertising successful or unsuccessful for advertisers and generate
   reports to understand and improve Service usage and advertising
   effectiveness.

   Storage and Access of Information

   In order to provide our Services, we store our Mookie cookies on the
   browser(s) of individuals to whom we have delivered advertising and
   then recognize the Mookie cookies, when your browser is used to access
   websites of our clients and publishers we work with.  Sites on which we
   are dropping and/or reading, or seek to drop and/or read, Mookie
   cookies should tell you about the use of third-party cookies, and in
   particular Mookie cookies where required by law, on those Sites. In the
   data feed we receive from our partners in connection with the delivery
   of digital advertising in mobile application environments we also
   receive Advertising IDs associated with users’ mobile device
   platforms/operating systems and recognize these Advertising IDs.

   We use the information collected and received for Interest-Based
   Advertising, such as:
     * Matching Data to Offline Sources – as indicated above under “User
       Information received from third parties”:
          + We receive offline User Information, including demographic and
            interest information, from other companies, including our
            clients, partners and service providers, that is collected
            outside the Platform and is provided to us for use in our
            Services.  It is the responsibility of those companies
            collecting that data to do so in an appropriate and legal way,
            and to permit sharing that information with us for our
            purposes.
          + When we receive offline User Information, this information is
            provided to us via a service provider in conjunction with a
            cookie ID, advertising ID, or similar user ID that identifies
            a customer or consumer to the client or service provider.
          + We do not receive any names, mailing addresses, phone numbers,
            email addresses or similar data that would enable
            identification of a particular individual connected with the
            IDs we receive.
     * Linking Devices – we make use of our own [mP]ID identifier to
       associate information relating to browsers, environments, and/or
       devices that we reasonably believe belong to the same user, in
       order to help provide more useful and relevant advertising
       regardless of browser, environment, or device.
     * Precise Geographic Location Data – when we have the necessary
       rights to do so we may receive and/or use a user’s precise
       geographic location data in connection with our Services.  Where we
       collect this type of data it is provided in the data feed we
       receive from our partners in connection with the delivery of
       digital advertising.

   Whom do we share data with?

   [m]PLATFORM shares data with GroupM agencies and their clients for
   purposes of delivering Interest-Based Advertising, analytics, and the
   other Services described above. We also share data with third-party
   service providers that perform services and functions on our behalf
   and/or on behalf of our clients, in the provision of the Services such
   as companies that are responsible for the actual delivery of
   Interest-Based Advertising – including demand-side platforms,
   advertising networks, advertising exchanges, and ad servers.

   If we reasonably believe we are obliged by law or legal process to
   disclose information to a third party (including law enforcement), then
   we will do so. In addition, we may disclose information to a third
   party (including an auditor or other service provider) in order to
   investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual
   prohibited activities and/or in order to review, evaluate, or address
   the integrity or security of our Platform and Services.

   Memberships

   We are a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the European
   Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), and the Digital
   Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC). In connection with these
   memberships, we adhere to the DAA’s self-regulatory framework, the IAB
   Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioural Advertising, and the DAAC’s
   Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising,
   respectively, in those markets where the applicable self-regulatory
   framework applies, and we support deployment of the Advertising Option
   icons (AdChoices and, where available, AppChoices). Advertisements that
   are provided by organizations that participate in these frameworks
   display the icon shown below when technologically feasible. Clicking on
   the icon provides you with information about Interest-Based
   Advertising.

   When the IAB Europe’s Transparency & Consent Framework is finalized, we
   plan to participate in the framework as a “global vendor”.

   Opt-out/Right to withdraw consent

   You may opt out of [m]PLATFORM Interest-Based Advertising through
   several mechanisms.

   You may choose not to receive customized third-party advertisements via
   [m]PLATFORM targeting cookies on the browser you are using by clicking
   below. If you do this the [m]PLATFORM targeting cookies will be
   replaced with an “opt-out” cookie. Any Interest-Based Advertising data
   linked to the replaced [m]PLATFORM targeting cookies will not be used
   for Interest-Based Advertising on any device or browser that we have
   reasonably linked to the browser where the information was collected.
   In addition, if we have actual knowledge that another device or browser
   is linked to your opted-out browser, that other device or browser will
   also be opted out from receiving Interest-Based Advertising via
   [m]PLATFORM.

   To opt out of data collection via cookies from [m]PLATFORM please click
   here .

   Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire ten years after they are
   initially issued. If you buy a new device, upgrade or change web
   browsers or delete this opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the
   opt-out process again. In order for the opt-out process to work, your
   browser must be set to accept third-party cookies.

   In browser environments, you may also refuse or remove cookies from
   both [m]PLATFORM and other service providers, via the following
   methods:
     * Adjusting your browser settings to refuse or remove cookies, which
       would result in the cessation of Interest-Based Advertising via
       cookies from [m]PLATFORM and from other providers. However, by
       doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on certain
       web sites or take full advantage of all web site offerings and
       Interest-Based Advertising. You may refuse or remove cookies by
       following the directions provided in your browser settings. Further
       information about cookies is available at www.aboutcookies.org,
       www.youronlinechoices.com, and www.aboutads.info/consumers#cookies.

     * Adjusting the cookie settings at the level of the web site owner
       where you granted us consent to our cookie usage; cookie settings
       options may vary by web site owner.

     * Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising via our targeting cookies,
       as well as the targeting cookies of other service providers, at the
       following web sites:

     * www.aboutads.info/choices/
     * www.youradchoices.ca/choices/
     * www.youronlinechoices.com (by clicking the “Your ad choices” link
       after selecting the appropriate country)

   In mobile app environments, you may opt out of Interest-Based
   Advertising from just [m]PLATFORM or from both [m]PLATFORM and other
   service providers, via the following methods:
     * Going to the privacy setting on your device and selecting “Limit Ad
       Tracking” via your device settings, which will result in the
       elimination of Interest-Based Advertising via the applicable
       advertising ID from [m]PLATFORM and from other providers.
     * Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising via the applicable
       advertising ID from [m]PLATFORM and/or other providers via the
       AppChoices app. Please note that, in order for the AppChoices app
       to function properly, the “Limit Ad Tracking” device setting must
       not be selected. Interest-Based Advertising data previously
       collected or received in association with the replaced advertising
       ID will not be used via [m]PLATFORM for Interest-Based Advertising
       on any other device or browser that we have reasonably linked to
       the mobile app environment where the information was collected. In
       addition, if we have actual knowledge that another device or
       browser is linked to the opted-out mobile app environment, that
       other device or browser will also be opted out from receiving
       Interest-Based Advertising via [m]PLATFORM. Additional information
       regarding the AppChoices app is available at
       http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and
       http://www.youradchoices.ca/choices/.


    For further information about what data [m]PLATFORM holds about you,
   please click here.

   Children’s privacy

   [m]PLATFORM’s Services are not directed at children (as defined by
   applicable law) or at Sites primarily directed to children. [m]PLATFORM
   does not knowingly collect information from children (determined in
   accordance with the age requirement for the applicable country). If you
   believe a child has provided us with personal data and would like to
   have the information removed, please contact us.

   Transfer of data in the event of acquisition

   In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of
   our assets, or all or substantially all of the assets of our Platform
   business, through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, corporate
   reorganization, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer
   all information or all Platform information, as applicable, that is in
   our possession or under our control to the acquiring party.

   Information security and global data transfers

   We follow generally accepted online advertising industry standards to
   protect against unauthorized access to, unlawful processing of,
   unauthorized retention of, and unauthorized disclosure of data. These
   standards include undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and
   management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and
   use. Please keep in mind, however, that despite these efforts to
   protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the
   Internet is guaranteed to be secure.

   [m]PLATFORM Services and the Platform are used globally and therefore
   we may transfer data to countries around the world, including countries
   outside your country. We will, where necessary, put in place
   appropriate safeguards to ensure such data is protected. When we
   transfer personal data from the EEA or Switzerland to an affiliate
   outside the EEA or Switzerland, we enter into standard (“model”)
   contractual clauses with the recipient in order to ensure an
   appropriate level of data protection.  When we transfer personal data
   from the EEA or Switzerland to an unaffiliated entity (such as a
   service provider performing services on our behalf) outside the EEA or
   Switzerland, we either enter into standard (“model”) contractual
   clauses, or substantially equivalent terms and conditions, or ensure
   that the transfer is pursuant to another valid mechanism, such as the
   service provider being certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy
   Shield Framework.

   Data retention

   We maintain the information we collect through our Services in
   non-aggregated form for a period of not more than 13 months. This data
   includes Sites visited, content viewed, ad interactions, IP addresses,
   browser type and language settings.  We maintain this information for
   the 13-month period to enable our clients to perform year-over-year
   analyses. For example, a retailer may wish to compare the effectiveness
   of its online advertising activities at Christmas for the current year
   vs. the effectiveness in the prior year. A 13-month retention period
   enables that client to perform such comparison.

   We maintain information we collect through our Services in an
   aggregated form for a period longer than 13 months.

   California

   Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of
   California can obtain certain information about the types of personal
   information that companies with whom they have an established business
   relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing
   purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request a list of
   companies, if any, to which [m]PLATFORM has provided personal
   information for its own marketing purposes, please email us at
   mplatformprivacy@groupm.com or write to us at [m]PLATFORM, c/o GroupM,
   498 7th Avenue, New York, NY 10018, USA, Attn: Privacy. Please allow 30
   days for a response.

   California law requires us to disclose how we respond to browser “Do
   Not Track” signals or other choice mechanisms relating to
   Interest-Based Advertising. We have not yet developed a response to
   browser “Do Not Track” signals, and do not change any of our data
   collection practices when we receive such signals. We will continue to
   evaluate potential responses to “Do Not Track” signals in light of
   industry developments or legal changes.

   We are committed to honoring privacy choices. For more information on
   opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising, please see the “Opt-Out/Right
   to Withdraw Consent” subsection above.

   Changes to this Privacy Notice

   Please note that because of the changing nature of privacy laws and
   regulations, digital technologies, and our business, we may modify this
   Privacy Notice from time to time. Please review this Privacy Notice
   periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred (we
   will update the effective date at the top of the page to help you know
   when changes have been made).

   Frequently Asked Questions

   Does GroupM share any information with other vendors or partners? We
   may provide access to information we collect to our vendors and
   contractors (also known as third parties) who are performing services
   on our behalf to enable the uses of your information that we have
   described above. These vendors are not permitted to use this
   information for any other purpose. As noted above the Website
   uses social media widgets including, but not limited to, YouTube,
   Twitter, and LinkedIn so users can easily share information about their
   visits with “likes” or “shares.” Always review the privacy policy of
   social media sites as their data collection practices are separate from
   GroupMpractices.  Additionally, we must disclose information when we
   believe we’re legally obliged to, or in order to investigate, prevent,
   or take action regarding prohibited activities, such as incidents of
   hacking, misuse, or other prohibited activities.

   Does GroupMtransfer your Personal Data outside the European Union? If
   you provide us with personal data, we may transfer that personal data
   to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across
   borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
   jurisdictions around the world to enable us to use that personal data
   as described above.  Our standard practice is to use European Union
   model clauses for the transfer of data from the EEA & Switzerland to
   other non-EEA countries.

   Use of this site by Children & Children’s data: We’re sensitive to
   children's privacy. Our Website is not developed for or directed at
   children under age 13. We specifically request that children not
   provide information about themselves through our Website.  If you
   believe your child has provided this kind of information and would like
   it deleted from our database, you can contact us at DPO@groupm.com . If
   we become aware we’ve collected information about a child under the age
   of 13, we’ll delete it.

   Data retention and storage: We will keep your information that we
   collect on the Website for a reasonable period for the purposes set out
   above. We follow generally accepted online advertising industry
   standards to ensure that your personal data disclosed to us is kept
   secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is
   necessary for the purposes for which it is used.  These standards
   include undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management
   activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use.

   Information Security: Maintaining the privacy of our users’ information
   is very important to us which means we take care and pay special
   attention to our security measures to protect this information from
   data breaches. We follow industry standards to protect against the
   unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of information.
   This includes physical, electronic, and management activities to
   protect information integrity, access, and use.

   Linking to other websites/Third party sites: A link from our Website to
   another website does not imply our endorsement of affiliates or
   websites, and we do not control third party websites to which we link,
   nor assume responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Once
   you follow a link to another website, the GroupM Privacy Notice no
   longer applies. It’s important to always read the privacy policy of any
   website you are visiting.

   Transfer of data upon change of control: In the event that another
   company acquires us, or all or substantially all of the assets of our
   business, through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other
   transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all information
   (including any information you may have provided through the “contact
   us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to the
   acquiring party, and that information may be used by the acquiring
   party in its business.

   Data Subject Rights of individuals in the EEA and Switzerland: You have
   the right to access, update, change, delete, restrict the use of, or
   obtain a copy of your Personal Data in an easily readable format. In

[m]PLATFORM Privacy Notice

   This is the global mPlatform privacy policy. Please read our EU and
   language specific versions here.

   Effective Date: May 25, 2018

   [m]PLATFORM Privacy Notice

   This Privacy Notice describes the information [m]PLATFORM collects from
   web sites, applications, and other digital properties, we refer to all
   of these as “Sites”. We explain how we use this information in our
   “Platform” and to provide “Services” to our clients. We also explain
   how you can manage your privacy choices and exercise your rights in
   relation to certain data about you collected and used by [m]PLATFORM.

   Who are we?

   [m]PLATFORM is a business which operates globally as part of the GroupM
   group of companies. In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland
   the [m]PLATFORM legal entity responsible for the data that [m]PLATFORM
   collects is [m]PLATFORM Ltd.  Outside of the EEA and Switzerland the
   responsible legal entity is mPlatform, LLC.

   [m]PLATFORM is GroupM’s audience intelligence and activation solution
   that builds personalized consumer relationships at scale. In addition
   to the technology suite, it is a worldwide service organization
   comprised of analysts, data strategists, search and social specialists,
   and product and media experts focused on ensuring consistent delivery
   in all markets where our clients do business.

   If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Notice,
   please see the “Contact us” section at the bottom of this Privacy
   Notice. Please note that this Privacy Notice has been translated from
   English into multiple different languages. If there are any conflicts
   or inconsistencies between the different language versions of this
   Privacy Notice, the English version will prevail.

   What are our Services?

   [m]PLATFORM owns and operates a technology platform (the “Platform”)
   that provides various advertising-related services (collectively,
   “Services”) for its clients, which consist of other GroupM agencies and
   businesses as well as other companies within the WPP plc group of
   companies. [m]PLATFORM does not provide services directly to consumers,
   our clients are corporate businesses who work with GroupM agencies to
   plan and buy media campaigns (advertising).

   GroupM agencies use our Platform and Services, for their own clients,
   to help them to understand the advertising that the clients deliver
   online (e.g. what sites it was delivered on, who saw it and whether or
   not anyone interacted with it) and to improve the effectiveness of that
   advertising and we also help them to try deliver advertising to
   consumers who are more likely to be interested in their products and
   services.

   When we help clients to select audiences to deliver their advertising
   to, we use certain demographic information (such as age, gender,
   education, income and household status (e.g., number of children)),
   geography, interests, activities, and similar information (“User
   Information”). We explain below where this information comes from. We
   call this type of advertising “Interest-Based Advertising”.

    What information is collected and utilized by [m]PLATFORM?

   The Platform is designed to collect and/or use information about the
   type of web pages that individuals visit and about interactions that
   they have with Sites and with our clients’ advertisements. We also
   collect information that identifies the browsers and devices of the
   individuals who have viewed our clients’ advertising. This information
   includes the following categories of data:

   Technical Identifiers

   These can be used to identify an individual’s browser, mobile
   advertising environment, and/or device, and typically include:
     * Cookie IDs
     * Mobile advertising IDs (e.g., IDFAs and Google Advertising IDs)
     * [m]PLATFORM’s “[mP]ID” proxy identifier for the above IDs


   Additional Technical Information
     * Internet protocol address (“IP address”) and data derived from an
       IP address, such as non-precise geolocation data that indicates the
       country, region, city, and/or postal code of a device
     * Type of Internet browser, browser language, and operating system
     * Connection type (wired or Wi-Fi), network to which the device is
       connected, and mobile carrier (if available)
     * Latitude/longitude of a (mobile) device.  For purposes of this
       Privacy Notice, “mobile device” includes smartphones and tablet
       computers.


   Online Activity Information

   [m]PLATFORM collects the information explained below about your online
   browsing activity to determine what types of activities, services and
   products you and other users may be interested in and how you and other
   users interact with certain advertisements. This information includes:
     * Records of the type of Sites and pages viewed (i.e., in order to
       ascertain interests)
     * Site/page you came from before, and visited after, viewing an
       advertisement
     * Date and time of online activity
     * Frequency of visits to a Site
     * Search terms used on a Site
     * Interaction with an advertisement (e.g., whether a user clicks on
       an advertisement)


   User Information received from Third Parties

   We also receive both online and offline User Information collected by
   third parties, including demographic and interest information for use
   in our Services. The third parties include our clients and carefully
   selected service providers.  When we receive offline User Information,
   this information is provided to us via a service provider in
   conjunction with a cookie ID, advertising ID, or similar user ID that
   identifies a customer or consumer to us, the client or service
   provider, but we do not receive any names, mailing addresses, phone
   numbers, email addresses or similar data that would enable
   identification of a particular individual connected with these IDs.

   How do we collect information?

   We collect information and receive information on behalf of our clients
   about individuals when you visit the online properties of our clients
   for whom [m]PLATFORM provides services, or third-party publishers (for
   example, news sites). In order to do this we use cookies, advertising
   IDs, pixels, and other technologies. Here are some explanations of
   these terms:

   Cookie

   is a small alphanumeric text file that is stored in a browser by a web
   site or by a third-party ad server or other third party which allows
   that web site or third party to recognize that browser and remember
   User Information and other information. Our targeting cookies, which
   are named “Mookie” and operate on the mookie1.com domain, are
   persistent cookies that contain unique randomly-generated values that
   enable our Services to distinguish browsers and devices and are
   associated with User Information and other information. Mookie cookies,
   together with this associated information, are used in the performance
   of our Services, and in particular Interest-Based Advertising
   activities. More information about our Mookie cookies is set forth in
   the table immediately below this explanation of terms.

   Advertising ID

   is an alphanumeric identifier made available by a platform or operating
   system (such as Apple iOS or Google Android) that allows application
   developers and third parties to recognize a particular device in an
   application environment. It is associated with User Information and
   other information and, together with this associated information, is
   used in the performance of our Services, and in particular
   Interest-Based Advertising activities.

   Pixel

   is a line of code that is used by a Site or third party to assign
   online activities to a device or browser, or more specifically to the
   applicable cookie or advertising ID. The use of a pixel allows us to
   record, for example, that a device or browser has visited a particular
   Site or page.

   The following chart provides information about our Mookie cookies, all
   of which are “persistent” cookies (meaning they are stored until they
   expire or are deleted/removed by a user) mapped to the mookie1.com
   domain:

   [m]PLATFORM processes the information it collects and receives for the
   purposes of providing the Services to clients which we have explained
   above, as well as for administrative, security and compliance purposes.
   Specifically, we carry out the following activities:

   How do we use this information?

   Ad Selection, Delivery, Reporting

   We analyze the information collected when client advertising is
   delivered through [m]PLATFORM and information received from our
   partners. We organize this information into collections of IDs (which
   we call segments), based on various components of the User Information
   we explained above.  For example, we may have segments of IDs that
   visit sport websites. GroupM agencies then use these segments within
   our platform to deliver Interest-Based Advertising for their clients,
   using our partners and service providers. This advertising may be
   delivered across computers, phones, and other mobile devices.

   We may also integrate (and use for the same purposes) User Information
   obtained from other carefully selected companies (including Site
   owners, data providers and data aggregators).

   We also maintain our own internal identifier, which we call “[mP]ID”.
   We use the [mP]ID to associate information relating to browsers,
   environments, and/or devices that we reasonably believe belong to the
   same user. This helps us to provide more useful and relevant
   advertising to a specific user, regardless of the browser, device, or
   environment.

   Personalization

   In order to provide our client-specific personalization Services, we:
     * collect information on each client’s Sites (this includes websites,
       apps, and other digital properties) – as described above in “How we
       collect information”;
     * access or store this information on devices (via cookie IDs and
       advertising IDs, as applicable); and
     * analyze the information collected, sometimes with other information
       received from the client and organize it into segments of IDs,
       based on the various User Information we have

   Our clients can then use these segments to deliver, on their own behalf
   or on behalf of their clients, Interest-Based Advertising to users on
   their computers, phones, and other mobile devices (this is through a
   variety of means).

   Where we are providing this client-specific personalization, the
   segments that we build for one client are logically segregated from the
   segments and data of other clients. Data collected in this way, and the
   segments produced, can only be used on behalf of that specific client.

   Measurement

   We process User Information to deliver advertisements and measure the
   delivery of these advertisements, to learn about what factors make
   advertising successful or unsuccessful for advertisers and generate
   reports to understand and improve Service usage and advertising
   effectiveness.

   Storage and Access of Information

   In order to provide our Services, we store our Mookie cookies on the
   browser(s) of individuals to whom we have delivered advertising and
   then recognize the Mookie cookies, when your browser is used to access
   websites of our clients and publishers we work with.  Sites on which we
   are dropping and/or reading, or seek to drop and/or read, Mookie
   cookies should tell you about the use of third-party cookies, and in
   particular Mookie cookies where required by law, on those Sites. In the
   data feed we receive from our partners in connection with the delivery
   of digital advertising in mobile application environments we also
   receive Advertising IDs associated with users’ mobile device
   platforms/operating systems and recognize these Advertising IDs.

   We use the information collected and received for Interest-Based
   Advertising, such as:
     * Matching Data to Offline Sources – as indicated above under “User
       Information received from third parties”:
          + We receive offline User Information, including demographic and
            interest information, from other companies, including our
            clients, partners and service providers, that is collected
            outside the Platform and is provided to us for use in our
            Services.  It is the responsibility of those companies
            collecting that data to do so in an appropriate and legal way,
            and to permit sharing that information with us for our
            purposes.
          + When we receive offline User Information, this information is
            provided to us via a service provider in conjunction with a
            cookie ID, advertising ID, or similar user ID that identifies
            a customer or consumer to the client or service provider.
          + We do not receive any names, mailing addresses, phone numbers,
            email addresses or similar data that would enable
            identification of a particular individual connected with the
            IDs we receive.
     * Linking Devices – we make use of our own [mP]ID identifier to
       associate information relating to browsers, environments, and/or
       devices that we reasonably believe belong to the same user, in
       order to help provide more useful and relevant advertising
       regardless of browser, environment, or device.
     * Precise Geographic Location Data – when we have the necessary
       rights to do so we may receive and/or use a user’s precise
       geographic location data in connection with our Services.  Where we
       collect this type of data it is provided in the data feed we
       receive from our partners in connection with the delivery of
       digital advertising.

   Whom do we share data with?

   [m]PLATFORM shares data with GroupM agencies and their clients for
   purposes of delivering Interest-Based Advertising, analytics, and the
   other Services described above. We also share data with third-party
   service providers that perform services and functions on our behalf
   and/or on behalf of our clients, in the provision of the Services such
   as companies that are responsible for the actual delivery of
   Interest-Based Advertising – including demand-side platforms,
   advertising networks, advertising exchanges, and ad servers.

   If we reasonably believe we are obliged by law or legal process to
   disclose information to a third party (including law enforcement), then
   we will do so. In addition, we may disclose information to a third
   party (including an auditor or other service provider) in order to
   investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual
   prohibited activities and/or in order to review, evaluate, or address
   the integrity or security of our Platform and Services.

   Memberships

   We are a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the European
   Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), and the Digital
   Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC). In connection with these
   memberships, we adhere to the DAA’s self-regulatory framework, the IAB
   Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioural Advertising, and the DAAC’s
   Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising,
   respectively, in those markets where the applicable self-regulatory
   framework applies, and we support deployment of the Advertising Option
   icons (AdChoices and, where available, AppChoices). Advertisements that
   are provided by organizations that participate in these frameworks
   display the icon shown below when technologically feasible. Clicking on
   the icon provides you with information about Interest-Based
   Advertising.

   When the IAB Europe’s Transparency & Consent Framework is finalized, we
   plan to participate in the framework as a “global vendor”.

   Opt-out/Right to withdraw consent

   You may opt out of [m]PLATFORM Interest-Based Advertising through
   several mechanisms.

   You may choose not to receive customized third-party advertisements via
   [m]PLATFORM targeting cookies on the browser you are using by clicking
   below. If you do this the [m]PLATFORM targeting cookies will be
   replaced with an “opt-out” cookie. Any Interest-Based Advertising data
   linked to the replaced [m]PLATFORM targeting cookies will not be used
   for Interest-Based Advertising on any device or browser that we have
   reasonably linked to the browser where the information was collected.
   In addition, if we have actual knowledge that another device or browser
   is linked to your opted-out browser, that other device or browser will
   also be opted out from receiving Interest-Based Advertising via
   [m]PLATFORM.

   To opt out of data collection via cookies from [m]PLATFORM please click
   here .

   Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire ten years after they are
   initially issued. If you buy a new device, upgrade or change web
   browsers or delete this opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the
   opt-out process again. In order for the opt-out process to work, your
   browser must be set to accept third-party cookies.

   In browser environments, you may also refuse or remove cookies from
   both [m]PLATFORM and other service providers, via the following
   methods:
     * Adjusting your browser settings to refuse or remove cookies, which
       would result in the cessation of Interest-Based Advertising via
       cookies from [m]PLATFORM and from other providers. However, by
       doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on certain
       web sites or take full advantage of all web site offerings and
       Interest-Based Advertising. You may refuse or remove cookies by
       following the directions provided in your browser settings. Further
       information about cookies is available at www.aboutcookies.org,
       www.youronlinechoices.com, and www.aboutads.info/consumers#cookies.

     * Adjusting the cookie settings at the level of the web site owner
       where you granted us consent to our cookie usage; cookie settings
       options may vary by web site owner.

     * Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising via our targeting cookies,
       as well as the targeting cookies of other service providers, at the
       following web sites:

     * www.aboutads.info/choices/
     * www.youradchoices.ca/choices/
     * www.youronlinechoices.com (by clicking the “Your ad choices” link
       after selecting the appropriate country)

   In mobile app environments, you may opt out of Interest-Based
   Advertising from just [m]PLATFORM or from both [m]PLATFORM and other
   service providers, via the following methods:
     * Going to the privacy setting on your device and selecting “Limit Ad
       Tracking” via your device settings, which will result in the
       elimination of Interest-Based Advertising via the applicable
       advertising ID from [m]PLATFORM and from other providers.
     * Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising via the applicable
       advertising ID from [m]PLATFORM and/or other providers via the
       AppChoices app. Please note that, in order for the AppChoices app
       to function properly, the “Limit Ad Tracking” device setting must
       not be selected. Interest-Based Advertising data previously
       collected or received in association with the replaced advertising
       ID will not be used via [m]PLATFORM for Interest-Based Advertising
       on any other device or browser that we have reasonably linked to
       the mobile app environment where the information was collected. In
       addition, if we have actual knowledge that another device or
       browser is linked to the opted-out mobile app environment, that
       other device or browser will also be opted out from receiving
       Interest-Based Advertising via [m]PLATFORM. Additional information
       regarding the AppChoices app is available at
       http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and
       http://www.youradchoices.ca/choices/.


    For further information about what data [m]PLATFORM holds about you,
   please click here.

   Children’s privacy

   [m]PLATFORM’s Services are not directed at children (as defined by
   applicable law) or at Sites primarily directed to children. [m]PLATFORM
   does not knowingly collect information from children (determined in
   accordance with the age requirement for the applicable country). If you
   believe a child has provided us with personal data and would like to
   have the information removed, please contact us.

   Transfer of data in the event of acquisition

   In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of
   our assets, or all or substantially all of the assets of our Platform
   business, through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, corporate
   reorganization, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer
   all information or all Platform information, as applicable, that is in
   our possession or under our control to the acquiring party.

   Information security and global data transfers

   We follow generally accepted online advertising industry standards to
   protect against unauthorized access to, unlawful processing of,
   unauthorized retention of, and unauthorized disclosure of data. These
   standards include undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and
   management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and
   use. Please keep in mind, however, that despite these efforts to
   protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the
   Internet is guaranteed to be secure.

   [m]PLATFORM Services and the Platform are used globally and therefore
   we may transfer data to countries around the world, including countries
   outside your country. We will, where necessary, put in place
   appropriate safeguards to ensure such data is protected. When we
   transfer personal data from the EEA or Switzerland to an affiliate
   outside the EEA or Switzerland, we enter into standard (“model”)
   contractual clauses with the recipient in order to ensure an
   appropriate level of data protection.  When we transfer personal data
   from the EEA or Switzerland to an unaffiliated entity (such as a
   service provider performing services on our behalf) outside the EEA or
   Switzerland, we either enter into standard (“model”) contractual
   clauses, or substantially equivalent terms and conditions, or ensure
   that the transfer is pursuant to another valid mechanism, such as the
   service provider being certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy
   Shield Framework.

   Data retention

   We maintain the information we collect through our Services in
   non-aggregated form for a period of not more than 13 months. This data
   includes Sites visited, content viewed, ad interactions, IP addresses,
   browser type and language settings.  We maintain this information for
   the 13-month period to enable our clients to perform year-over-year
   analyses. For example, a retailer may wish to compare the effectiveness
   of its online advertising activities at Christmas for the current year
   vs. the effectiveness in the prior year. A 13-month retention period
   enables that client to perform such comparison.

   We maintain information we collect through our Services in an
   aggregated form for a period longer than 13 months.

   California

   Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of
   California can obtain certain information about the types of personal
   information that companies with whom they have an established business
   relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing
   purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request a list of
   companies, if any, to which [m]PLATFORM has provided personal
   information for its own marketing purposes, please email us at
   mplatformprivacy@groupm.com or write to us at [m]PLATFORM, c/o GroupM,
   498 7th Avenue, New York, NY 10018, USA, Attn: Privacy. Please allow 30
   days for a response.

   California law requires us to disclose how we respond to browser “Do
   Not Track” signals or other choice mechanisms relating to
   Interest-Based Advertising. We have not yet developed a response to
   browser “Do Not Track” signals, and do not change any of our data
   collection practices when we receive such signals. We will continue to
   evaluate potential responses to “Do Not Track” signals in light of
   industry developments or legal changes.

   We are committed to honoring privacy choices. For more information on
   opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising, please see the “Opt-Out/Right
   to Withdraw Consent” subsection above.

   regulations, digital technologies, and our business, we may modify this

   details about these technologies, please refer to the FAQ section of
   this notice which provides links to their own privacy notices

   In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland the GroupM legal
   entity responsible for the data that GroupM collects is GroupM UK
   Limited.  Outside of the EEA and Switzerland the responsible legal
   entity is GroupM Worldwide, LLC.

   This notice outlines how and why GroupM (“GroupM”) collects and uses
   personal data specifically from visits to the groupm.com and
   groupmpublications.com websites (“Website”). It also explains your
   rights as someone who may provide personal data to GroupM through the

   residing in the EEA or Switzerland you should be aware that our DPO can
   contacted at DPO@GroupM.com.

   visitors to our website. It is stored in your browser and allows us to
   identify you.

   a cookie remains on your device until you delete it or it expires
   automatically; this is called a persistent cookie. Both types of
   cookies are used on our Website.

   future visits. Our lawful basis for this type of processing is that we

   Frequently Asked Questions

   Does GroupM share any information with other vendors or partners? We
   may provide access to information we collect to our vendors and
   contractors (also known as third parties) who are performing services
   on our behalf to enable the uses of your information that we have
   described above. These vendors are not permitted to use this
   information for any other purpose. As noted above the Website
   uses social media widgets including, but not limited to, YouTube,
   Twitter, and LinkedIn so users can easily share information about their
   visits with “likes” or “shares.” Always review the privacy policy of
   social media sites as their data collection practices are separate from
   GroupMpractices.  Additionally, we must disclose information when we
   believe we’re legally obliged to, or in order to investigate, prevent,
   or take action regarding prohibited activities, such as incidents of
   hacking, misuse, or other prohibited activities.

   Does GroupMtransfer your Personal Data outside the European Union? If
   you provide us with personal data, we may transfer that personal data
   to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across
   borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
   jurisdictions around the world to enable us to use that personal data
   as described above.  Our standard practice is to use European Union
   model clauses for the transfer of data from the EEA & Switzerland to
   other non-EEA countries.

   Use of this site by Children & Children’s data: We’re sensitive to
   children's privacy. Our Website is not developed for or directed at
   children under age 13. We specifically request that children not
   provide information about themselves through our Website.  If you
   believe your child has provided this kind of information and would like
   it deleted from our database, you can contact us at DPO@groupm.com . If
   we become aware we’ve collected information about a child under the age
   of 13, we’ll delete it.

   Data retention and storage: We will keep your information that we
   collect on the Website for a reasonable period for the purposes set out
   above. We follow generally accepted online advertising industry
   standards to ensure that your personal data disclosed to us is kept
   secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is
   necessary for the purposes for which it is used.  These standards
   include undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management
   activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use.

   Information Security: Maintaining the privacy of our users’ information
   is very important to us which means we take care and pay special
   attention to our security measures to protect this information from
   data breaches. We follow industry standards to protect against the
   unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of information.
   This includes physical, electronic, and management activities to
   protect information integrity, access, and use.

   Linking to other websites/Third party sites: A link from our Website to
   another website does not imply our endorsement of affiliates or
   websites, and we do not control third party websites to which we link,
   nor assume responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Once
   you follow a link to another website, the GroupM Privacy Notice no
   longer applies. It’s important to always read the privacy policy of any
   website you are visiting.

   Transfer of data upon change of control: In the event that another
   company acquires us, or all or substantially all of the assets of our
   business, through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other
   transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all information
   (including any information you may have provided through the “contact
   us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to the
   acquiring party, and that information may be used by the acquiring
   party in its business.

   Data Subject Rights of individuals in the EEA and Switzerland: You have
   the right to access, update, change, delete, restrict the use of, or
   obtain a copy of your Personal Data in an easily readable format. In
   certain circumstances, you may also request that GroupM transfer your
   Personal Data to a third party, and the right to object to its use for
   marketing purposes. If you wish to exercise any of these rights please
   contact our DPO at DPO@GroupM.com.

   Where our processing of your personal data is based on your consent,
   you also have the right to withdraw this consent at any time by
   contacting our DPO at DPO@GroupM.com. Please note that your withdrawal
   of consent will not affect the lawfulness of our processing of your
   personal data prior to withdrawal of consent.
