   will offer some new amenities that come along with a permanent space,
   including parking (non-gameday) and on-site jersey customization.

   The Black & Blue team store will also be open on gamedays up until 90
   minutes before gates open. After that, you'll need to head into the
   stadium in order to access the store, alongside three other merchandise
   stops within the stadium. The additional shops can be found in each
   corner of Allianz Field, so that no matter where you are seated,
   gearing up with your favorite Loons' merch is convenient and fast,
   however the main Black & Blue team store, located on the Northwest
   corner of the Stadium near the Bell Bank Gate, will be the only place
   that offers on-site jersey customization.

Playoff Scenarios Part 3: Clinching a Home Game

   September 30, 201912:22PM CDT
   William Rodgers IV William Rodgers IV
   Follow@ billyrodgersafc

   With six Western Conference games being played simultaneously, Sunday
   was an evening filled with an array of red cards, last-minute
   game-winners and results that once again left spots two through seven
   in the West wide open for the taking.

   Here are all the results from a busy night in the Western Conference:

   Minnesota United 1 – 1 LAFC
   Colorado Rapids 3 – 0 FC Dallas
   LA Galaxy 3 – 4 Vancouver Whitecaps FC
   San Jose Earthquakes 0 – 1 Seattle Sounders
   Real Salt Lake 2 – 1 Houston Dynamo
   Sporting KC 2 – 2 Portland Timbers

   A 1-1 draw between Minnesota United and LAFC means that the Loons will
   have to wait until this Sunday’s Decision Day game at CenturyLink Field
   against the Seattle Sounders to potentially secure a first-round home
   playoff game at Allianz Field. With the Sounders winning through a 94th
   minute Jordan Morris goal, Minnesota and Seattle are now level on 53
   points heading into this weekend.

   The Western Conference table with every team who is still
   mathematically in playoff contention is as follows:
    1. LAFC – 69 points, 33 games played, 19 wins, +44 goal differential
    2. Minnesota United – 53 points, 33 games played, 15 wins, +10 goal
       differential
    3. Seattle Sounders – 53 points, 33 games played, 15 wins, +2 goal
       differential
    4. LA Galaxy – 51 points, 33 games played, 16 wins, +1 goal
       differential
    5. Real Salt Lake – 50 points, 33 games played, 15 wins, +4 goal
       differential
    6. Portland Timbers – 46 points, 33 games played, 13 wins, +1 goal
       differential
    7. FC Dallas – 45 points, 33 games played, 12 wins, +2 goal
       differential
    8. San Jose Earthquakes – 44 points, 33 games played, 13 wins, -1 goal
       differential
    9. Colorado Rapids – 42 points, 33 games played, 12 wins, -3 goal
       differential

   What Now?

   With LAFC, Minnesota United, Seattle Sounders, LA Galaxy and Real Salt
   Lake all clinching playoff berths before the final game of the season,
   the focal points of Decision Day will be these five teams vying to host
   a first-round playoff game, as well as Portland, FC Dallas, San Jose
   and the Colorado Rapids all attempting to claw their way above the
   playoff line.

   Minnesota United will secure the second seed from the Western
   Conference in the 2019 MLS Cup Playoffs on Decision Day if:

   MNUFC wins by any score vs. Seattle Sounders

   OR

   MNUFC ties vs. Seattle Sounders AND
   LA Galaxy ties vs. Houston Dynamo

   OR

   MNUFC ties vs. Seattle Sounders AND
   LA Galaxy loses vs. Houston Dynamo

   If MNUFC fail to take any points away from Century Link Field, the
   Loons will still secure a home playoff game if:

   LA Galaxy ties vs. Houston Dynamo AND
   Real Salt Lake ties vs. Vancouver Whitecaps

   OR

   LA Galaxy ties vs. Houston Dynamo AND
   Real Salt Lake loses vs. Vancouver Whitecaps

   OR

   LA Galaxy wins vs. Houston Dynamo AND
   Real Salt Lake loses vs. Vancouver Whitecaps

   OR

   LA Galaxy wins vs. Houston Dynamo AND
   Real Salt Lake ties vs. Vancouver Whitecaps

   OR

   LA Galaxy loses vs. Houston Dynamo AND
   Real Salt Lake wins vs. Vancouver Whitecaps

   OR

   LA Galaxy ties vs. Houston Dynamo AND
   Real Salt Lake wins vs. Vancouver Whitecaps

   OR SIMPLY

   LA Galaxy loses vs. Houston Dynamo AND
   Real Salt Lake loses vs. Vancouver Whitecaps

   To put all of this into simple terms, a Minnesota United win in Seattle
   – by any score – would clinch second place for the Loons. On the other
   hand, if MNUFC draw or fail to get a result on the road, it will need
   the results from the LA Galaxy and Real Salt Lake games to go its way.
   While there are many ways that Decision Day could shape up, a positive
   result for Minnesota United and both LA Galaxy and RSL not taking full
   points would be the simplest situation.

   Check out the schedule for this Sunday’s home playoff game race on
   Decision Day below:

   Seattle Sounders vs. MNUFC
   3:00 p.m. CT | FOX Sports North+

   Vancouver Whitecaps FC vs. Real Salt Lake
   3:00 p.m. CT | MLS Live on ESPN+

   Houston Dynamo vs. LA Galaxy
   3:00 p.m. CT | MLS Live on ESPN+

   If Allianz Field were to host Minnesota United’s first-ever MLS playoff
   game, season ticket members would be guaranteed their season seats, so
   long as they did not opt out earlier. For everyone else, the best path
   to getting tickets right now is to join The Preserve, the official
   waiting list for season tickets at Allianz Field, or by signing up for
   our newsletters. Both those groups will get access to presales before
   tickets go on sale to the general public. Visit mnufc.com/preserve for
   more info on the former and mnufc.com/newsletter for more info on the
   latter.
