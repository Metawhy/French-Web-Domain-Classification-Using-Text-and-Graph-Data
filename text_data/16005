   Research has indicated that students report a better understanding of
   content presented, a strong sense of community in the classroom, and
   opportunity to develop an appreciation for the diversity of classmates'
   backgrounds, experiences, knowledge, and beliefs when using accountable
   talk.
   The following phrases on are on the desk cards:
   "I agree with you because..."
   "I disagree with you because..."
   "Why do you think that?"
   "I do not understand. Can you explain?"
   "I know my answer is right because..."
   "I solved this problem by..."
   "Another way to solve this problem is...”

   Independent Reading in Kindergarten

Independent Reading in Kindergarten

   2
   Getting kindergarten students to sit in one spot and read for an
   extended period of time can be a daunting task. I’ve been interested in
   moving to an “independent reading” model in my classroom instead of
   centers/Daily 5, but I’ve struggled to build the reading stamina to
   45-60 minutes. But... in my final year of teaching, I think I’m finally
   getting somewhere. My students are directed to find a comfy spot in the
   room and read their book baggies which are filled with 8-10 texts that
   are on their independent and instructional level. They are expected to
   read the whole time and can move to the word work table to take a brain
   break while working on differentiated phonics skills. Once they’re done
   with word work, they go back to their books and continue reading.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2016-04-25%2Bat%2B7.31.07%2BPM.png]
    I created these interactive, adapted CVC books for my students who
   needed a little more engagement while reading. These students read the
   books in their baggies, complete word work activities when they need a
   brain break, and continue reading throughout the block with these
   laminated books. I’m excited that my students are reading, building
   foundational phonics skills, and building their stamina all at the same
   time!! The best part is they LOVE reading them and their confidence in
   reading has gone up so much. Below is another adapted book set that I
   created for my students to use during independent reading.
   [IMG_3106.JPG]
   [Photo%2BMar%2B12.jpeg]
   My students are expected to complete a graphic organizer at least 3
   times throughout the week during independent reading. All of the
   graphic organizers have been directly taught so there’s no confusion as
   to how to complete it. Some students may take 2-3 days to complete 1
   graphic organizer or reading response which is why I only make them
   complete at least 3 per week.

   Has anyone else tried independent reading in kindergarten? I would love
   to hear of more ideas!

   Teaching kindergarten in a rural area of Florida for the past four
   years has taught me that not all kindergarteners start school knowing
   their colors. I can’t wait to [DEL: use these books :DEL]  let my
   teacher friends borrow these books at the beginning of next school year
   (I keep forgetting I won’t be in the classroom next year!!)

   The real photographs are great conversation starters for students who
   need more vocabulary!
   Each book takes about 6-8 minutes to make. I use this ProClick binding

Behavior Contracts | Primary and Special Education | ADHD

   Do you have a student that is repeatedly calling out in class, no
   matter how many times you’ve addressed raising his hand and waiting to
   be called on? Or a student that is constantly disrupting/distracting
   other students?
   A great way to address unwanted behavior in a classroom setting is a
   behavior contract.

   The first page introduces the book to the student. Drawing pictures of
   their emotions will help them connect to these emotions as they happen
   in real life. Discuss situations they feel these emotions in, letting
   them know it is appropriate to feel these at different times in our
   life.
   [IMG_3015.jpg]
   This page allows the teacher to understand what the student feels is
   most/least distracting. This can sometimes help a teacher who is unsure
   of what to try next. The distractors can seem hidden to us as teachers,
   but so obvious to the student. The first way to make progress is to
   identify the problems.
   [IMG_3016.jpg]
   This page encourages the student to think about what rules they know of
   and the consequences for breaking the rules. Sometimes just talking
   about what is appropriate/not appropriate will improve behaviors. This
   page can easily be referenced in real situations… “Remember that rule
   you mentioned? What is the consequence?” …to prevent the behavior from
   occurring.
   [IMG_3017.jpg]
   This checklist provides an opportunity for the student to help the
   teacher understand them better. Tell students to be honest with what
   they want you to know. All of this information is used to gain a better
   understanding of how to help this child.
   [IMG_3018.jpg]
   A to-do list, which comes in two sizes, can be used for anything you
   want the student to complete. The items on the list should accommodate
   the student, not hinder them. For example, some students can handle
   having a week’s worth of assignments/things to do, where some students
   need it broken down by day or even by hours. If parents are having
   trouble at home, have them use the to-do list for regular routines such
   as brushing teeth, completing homework, etc.
   [IMG_3019.jpg]
   Goal setting is always a great way to start a discussion about change.
   The student has to be motivated to change their behavior and goal
   planning for future, weekly, and daily can help with that. Again, this
   planning sheet can be used in any way, but is designed for future,
   weekly, and daily goals to be aligned. Each goal should get more
   specific.

   My students were literally begging me to give them more of these books!
   I am so excited to share them. This set includes CVCe words. CVC,
   digraphs, blends, and vowel teams are all coming soon!

   [IMG_2977.JPG]
   This resource can be used in so many ways- homework, guided reading,
   independent reading...
   Here is how I use this in my kindergarten classroom.
   On Monday, students review the sight word flash cards and phonics
   words. I usually split the differentiation into two groups, sometimes
   three or more depending on the time of year.
   [Photo%2BApr%2B21.jpeg]
    They complete page 1 and 2 and read the passage one time, coloring in
   the first star.
   [IMG_2978.JPG]
   [IMG_2979.JPG]
   On Tuesday, students re-read flash cards and phonics cards. Read the
   passage for the second time and color in another star. They then
   complete page 4 by listing all of the phonics “focus” words. Students
   highlight the phonics words in the passage.
   On Wednesday, students re-read all flashcards again, re-read the
   passage for a third time, and complete page 5 by listing the “focus”
   sight words. Students highlight the sight words in the passage.

   LOVE how these little flip books came out. They were pretty simple to
   make to! If you don't have a binding machine, you could always use
   binder rings or leave them apart so students can sort them into word
