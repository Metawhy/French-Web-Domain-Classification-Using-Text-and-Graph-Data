Review: The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane

   [deliverancednace.JPG]  Title: The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane
    Author:  Katherine Howe
    Published:  Hyperion Voice, 2009
    How I Got It: Purchased myself
    Rating: 3.5 stars
   Review:
   When we first meet our main character Connie she is a graduate student
   stress-case.  She is preparing for a super important test that she must
   pass in order to continue her education.  The exam covers all aspects
   of American colonial history.  If you miss a question or don't answer
   one fully then that's it, you're out of the program.  Oh, and it's not
   a written test either, your mentors ask you the questions and you have
   to come up with your answer on the spot (talk about pressure!).
   Luckily, Connie  excels and passes to exam.  It's the beginning of the
   summer so Connie expects that she can relax a little now.
   Unfortunately, Grace, her mother has other plans.  Grace needs Connie
   to clean and fix up her grandmother's house that has been neglected for
   years.  All of a sudden it needs to be sold.  Connie isn't thrilled
   about spending the summer this way but she can't say no to her mother.
   During her first night at the house Connie finds a mysterious key.  It
   intrigues her and from that point on Connie is determined to figure out
   what it goes to.  This is the catalyst that begins the search for
   Deliverance Dance's physick book.
   I love historical fiction books that go back and forth between the past
   and present.  I love seeing how the different stories and different
   time periods connect.  This book was no exception.  Howe takes us on a
   journey to Marblehead, MA in 1991 and then back in time to Salem, MA
   circa 1692.  Deliverance Dane was a woman found guilty of witchcraft
   and was executed.  Connie just happened to come across a piece of
   history while doing a good deed for her mother.   Like any good
   historian, Connie investigates and uncovers a woman forgotten by the
   history books and learns some things about her family’s past.
   While I did enjoy this book I felt it ended too sudden.   We find a few
   things out and then it seems like the book just ends.  We learn what
   happens to Sam but don’t get to read about what happens to him (I hope
   that made sense, I’m having trouble wording it without listing
   spoilers).
   *side note* Every time I saw the name ‘Chilton’ I thought of Gilmore
   Girls.
   I’m so glad Howe included a postscript.  Deliverance Dane was a real
   person (while reading the book I thought she was just a fictional
   character).   There’s not a lot of information about her though.  She
   was accused of witchcraft and spent thirteen weeks in prison but
   luckily, her life was spared.
   The Salem witch trials are a part of history that has always interested
   me.  It baffles me that a group of teenage girls were able to convince
   an entire town that they were in the company of witches.  That their
   own next door neighbors could be putting curses on other people in the
   town.  It was a point in history when people were extremely fearful
   (especially with a war occurring less than 100 miles away) but still.
   I wonder if those girls felt any remorse for contributing to the
   panic.  But they were only a part of the uprising.  People truly
   believed that witchcraft was real.
   What are you thoughts about the Salem witch trials?  Ever visited
   Salem, MA?

Review: Dash and Lily's Book of Dares

   [dashandlily.JPG]
   Title/Author:  Dash and Lily’s Book of Dares by Rachel Cohn and David
   Levithan
   Published: 2010, Knopf Books for Young Readers
   Source: Purchased myself at B&N
   Rating:  5 stars
   Summary (from Goodreads):
   “I’ve left some clues for you. If you want them, turn the page. If you
   don’t, put the book back on the shelf, please.”
   So begins the latest whirlwind romance from the New York Times
   bestselling authors of Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist. Lily has left
   a red notebook full of challenges on a favorite bookstore shelf,
   waiting for just the right guy to come along and accept its dares. But
   is Dash that right guy? Or are Dash and Lily only destined to trade
   dares, dreams, and desires in the notebook they pass back and forth at
   locations across New York? Could their in-person selves possibly
   connect as well as their notebook versions? Or will they be a comic
   mismatch of disastrous proportions?
   Review:
   After reading this book I am so tempted to get a notebook, scribble
   down a riddle and leave it in a bookstore next to a favorite book and
   cross my fingers that a cute (intelligent) guy comes along, finds the
   notebook and plays along.
   I loved the story.  Dash, while cynical, is the male equivalent of
   Jessica Darling.  Seriously, I think they’d be best friends.  He always
   has some witty remark.  Lily unintentionally isolates herself from
   people and just wants a friend.  She’s the captain and star athlete of
   her school’s soccer team yet doesn’t hang out with any of her
   teammates.
   Dash and Lily’s relationship kind of reminded me of my bookish
   community friends.  I’ve never met any of you, yet I kind of have an
   idea in my head what you all look like and sound like (and I don’t mean
   this is a creepy way!).  Then when I watch a vlog it throws me off a
   little.  Dash and Lily each had an idea of what the other one was like.
   What I loved about the book:
     * I laughed over the crimson alert and that entire ordeal.  Who knew
       throwing snowballs could be so dangerous?
     * Snarly.  To me describing someone as snarly means their hair is
       full of knots and desperately needs to be brushed.
     * I loved all of the dares and following Dash and Lily through New
       York City at Christmastime.
     * Dashiell.  What a great name.
     * Cover love.  Love love love the heart-shaped snowflakes on the
       cover.

   After writing this up I noticed I clearly favor Dash over Lily.  Even
   though Lily is also a main character more things about Dash stick out
   in my mind.
   I highly recommend this book!  It’s set during the holidays and its
   part of the story, but its not really a Christmas-y book.  So if you
   were looking for a sappy or sugar-sweet read for the holiday season
   then this probably isn’t the book for you.

Review: Jumpstart the World

   [jumpstart.JPG]
   Title:  Jumpstart the World
   Author:  Catherine Ryan Hyde
   Published:  Knopf, October 2010
   How I Got It:  Purchased for my nook
   Rating: 5 stars
   Thoughts:
   Jumpstart the World by Catherine Ryan Hyde is fantastic read.  The book
   isn’t even 200 pages long but it is filled with so much emotion.
   You’ll feel happy, sad, grateful, encouraged, guilty, depressed but
   also inspired and ready the change the world.  Ultimately, I think this
   book is about acceptance and tolerance.
   Sixteen-year old Elle has just moved into her very first apartment, her
   only companion is the cat she just got from a shelter (she picked the
   least friendly cat out of the bunch).  Her mother’s new boyfriend
   doesn’t like teenagers so instead of kicking him to the curb Elle gets
   kicked out.  Her mother pays for the apartment (which is on the other
   side of town) and checks in every so often.
   The only neighbors Elle gets to know are Frank and his girlfriend,
   Molly.  They live in the apartment next to Elle and even share a fire
   escape.  Elle takes an instant liking to Frank.  She develops a crush
   on him and is devastated when she unexpectedly finds out that Frank is
   transgender.  He’s currently in the process of going from a female to a
   male.  Needless to say it came as quite a shock to Elle.  The last half
   of the book is about Elle dealing with the aftermath of finding out
   about Frank.  She's not really sure what to think about it or how to
   react to it.
   *One random fact about Elle:  Do not steal a cab from her, especially
   if she is upset about something.
   Lately I've been trying to write down my favorite quotes from books.
   These are my four favorite quotes from Jumpstart the World:

     "Words are important...words are the tools we use for making peace
     with the world" - Chapter 3

   “You’re supposed to make mistakes.  You’re just starting out.  Mistakes
   are a good thing.  They mean you were brave enough to try something
   hard” – Chapter 6

   “Sometimes you have to jumpstart the world just to get it to be what
   even the world admits it should be” – Chapter 12

   “I decided that not talking is like a litmus test for a real friend.
   You can just sit there and be.  Not always be filling up the air with
   words” – Chapter 14

   I loved this book.  I definitely think it is a must read for everyone.
   It’s a great story about learning to accept others even if they're
   different.  Plus there are funny chapter titles like, “The Heartbreak
   of Too Many Guys Named Bob” and “Mascara, and Other Things That Run”.
   Also, how is it that I have not read any of Catherine Ryan Hyde’s other
   books before?
   On Hyde's website she has Five Ways To Jumpstart The World listed.
   Please go take a look at them. She has some great ideas listed.

Review: Revolution

   [revolution.JPG]
   Title/Author:  Revolution by Jennifer Donnelly
   Published:  Random House, 2010
   Source:  Purchased myself for my nook
   Why I Read It: I've heard such great things about the book!
   Rating: 4 stars
   Summary (from Goodreads):
   BROOKLYN: Andi Alpers is on the edge. She’s angry at her father for
   leaving, angry at her mother for not being able to cope, and
   heartbroken by the loss of her younger brother, Truman. Rage and grief
   are destroying her. And she’s about to be expelled from Brooklyn
   Heights’ most prestigious private school when her father intervenes.
   Now Andi must accompany him to Paris for winter break.
   PARIS: Alexandrine Paradis lived over two centuries ago. She dreamed of
   making her mark on the Paris stage, but a fateful encounter with a
   doomed prince of France cast her in a tragic role she didn’t want—and
   couldn’t escape.
   Two girls, two centuries apart. One never knowing the other. But when
   Andi finds Alexandrine’s diary, she recognizes something in her words
   and is moved to the point of obsession. There’s comfort and distraction
   for Andi in the journal’s antique pages—until, on a midnight journey
   through the catacombs of Paris, Alexandrine’s words transcend paper and
   time, and the past becomes suddenly, terrifyingly present.
   Review:
   Let me start off by saying that I learned a lot about the French
   Revolution from this book.  Honestly, I didn’t remember much about it
   from history classes I’ve taken.  The Revolution was a scary time for
   the people of France.  Thousands of people had to unfortunate pleasure
   of being guillotined.  There are literally thousands of people buried
   below the streets of Paris.  If I ever make it to Paris I will probably
   get a little freaked out thinking about that while walking down a
   street!
   Jennifer Donnelly did a fantastic job bringing the past and present
   together.  For me, the book started off a little slow, partly because I
   expected to be introduced to Alex sooner.  The reader is in Andi’s head
   throughout the book.  We’re aware of Alex’s story by reading her diary-
   the one Andi finds hidden in a guitar case.
   Andi is a girl who has been through a lot in the past two years.  She
   witnessed her little brother being hit by a car.  Then her family falls
   apart, she always feels numb from antidepressants, her mother is going
   crazy, her father is never around, she’s in danger of not graduating
   high school and the only thing that’s keeping Andi afloat is music.
   Her father takes her to Paris for winter break and he hopes that by
   getting away it will help Andi heal some.
   Alex is a girl who lived during the Revolution in France in the
   1790’s.  Her family never had enough to eat, her father had been jailed
   many times for speaking out against the king, her sister was pregnant
   with no husband, the family put on puppet shows as a way to make a
   living and they heard there was plenty of food at Versailles and that
   going to Paris would solve all of their problems.  Sadly, they were
   mistaken.
   Louis-Charles, the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, is an
   important part in Alex’s story.  By reading Alex’s diary, Louis-Charles
   also becomes an essential part of Andi’s story.  Andi’s father is in
   Paris to do genetic testing on a heart that is believed to belong to
   Louis-Charles.  During the Revolution he was imprisoned in a tower
   under poor conditions.  There were rumors that he escaped and that a
   dead body was left in the tower for his captors to find.  No one knew
   for sure if Louis-Charles really escaped or if he died while
   imprisoned.
   In 2000, the heart really did undergo genetic testing.  Scientists
   tested the heart’s mitochondrial DNA and it was concluded that the
   heart belonged to Louis-Charles, the lost king of France.  I find it
   fascinating that in 1795 they were able to preserve the heart so well.
   Well enough that 205 years later it could still be tested on and get
   accurate results.  You can read more about it here and here.
   And that is your brief history lesson for the day.
   Back to the book.  I really enjoyed the story.  Sometimes I was getting
   confused with Alex’s diary entries so make sure you pay attention to
   the dates.  The next time I see fireworks going off (illegally) I’ll be
   wondering if they are for one specific person to see, and to know that
   they are not forgotten.
   I was listening to the radio the other day and I heard the song
   "Firework" by Katy Perry.  I'm not usually a fan of her songs but I
   thought this particular one fit perfectly with Andi and especially
   Alex:

Busy holiday season

   [the-muppet-christmas-carol-original.jpg]
   I've gone into a temporary hiatus.  I've been crazy busy between work
   and getting ready for the holidays.  So by the time I have time to read
   all I want to do is sleep or watch Christmas movies (not going to lie,
   I've been watching lots of Christmas movies).  But I'll be back in the
   first week of January.
   I hope everyone has a happy, safe holiday season and Santa brings you
   lots of books!  See you in the new year!

Quotes from "Fixing Delilah"

   [fixingdelilah.jpg] Title: Fixing Delilah
   Author: Sarah Ockler
   Published: Little, Brown Books, 2010
   Source:  Purchased myself at B&N
   Rating: 4.5 stars
   Summary:
   Things in Delilah Hannaford's life have a tendency to fall apart. She
   used to be a good student, but she can't seem to keep it together
   anymore. Her "boyfriend" isn't much of a boyfriend. And her mother
   refuses to discuss the fight that divided their family eight years ago.
   Falling apart, it seems, is a Hannaford tradition.
   Over a summer of new friendships, unexpected romance, and moments that
   test the complex bonds between mothers and daughters, Delilah must face
   her family's painful past. Can even her most shattered relationships be
   pieced together again?   (from Goodreads).
   Thoughts:
   I read this book last week.  I really enjoyed it but unfortunately I
   think I waited too long before writing a review.  I guess I need to
   review a book pretty soon after I finish reading it!  I tried writing
   one...but didn't like how it turned out.  Instead of a review I thought
   I would post my favorite quotes from the book:
   “An invisible electronic woman navigates us toward the highway from the
   distant planet Monotone, where everyone is tranquil and directionally
   adept” - page 3
   “...surrounding us is an ocean of mess and misunderstanding, full of
   pirates and sharks just waiting to see who slips in first” - page 5
   “It’s funny how someone can be such an integral part of your life, like
   you laugh at the same jokes and eat your ice cream cones the same way
   and share your toys and dreams and everything but your heartbeats, and
   then one day – nothing.  You share nothing.  It’s like none of it ever
   happened.” - pages 15-16
   “Sometimes I think I’m on the edge of some great understanding, looking
   up at all the answers I just can’t reach, like apples too high in the
   tree.  But tonight, I stretch my fingers toward the sky, and I think I
   have the answer” - page 140
   “Sometimes I wonder if my whole life will pass by this way: me waiting
   in the shadows, waiting for something to happen.  Waiting for someone
   else to make it happen.  Something new or different or crazy and
   amazing.  I’ve been there for so long, letting everyone else figure it
   out for me, floating along without much direction or conscious though.
   Reacting.  Attention-seeking. Impulsive. Reckless.”  - page 147
   “Words spilling out on the page like ninjas, sneaking up on the rest of
   us for the stealth attack” - page 149
   “I’ll probably have to devise some elaborate alternate communication
   method now, like writing in symbols in the dirt or tapping out letters
   in Morse code on my head, because I’ve obviously lost control of
   whatever brain parts are responsible for forming words” - page 154
   “Up here, we’re giants, locked into our steel cage while the ants work
   below and the seagulls hover and dive all around them” - page 157
   “...I wonder how much we don’t see.  How much of our lives we witness
   and accept as truth when the rest of the iceberg – the heaviest,
   bulkiest part – is buried and invisible” - page 178
   “I wonder how many loose buttons there are in this world, just rolling
   around in a jar without a mate or a blouse to go on.  No destiny.  No
   purpose.  Just sitting there, unnoticed.  Forgotten”  - page 258

          Glad you enjoyed it! I really liked this book. I'm fascinated by
          the Salem witch trials, like you mentioned: it's so bizar that a
          couple of girls could convince the whole town to execute women
          because they were 'witches'! I can't remember if you've read The
          Heretic's Daughter by Kathleen Kent, I really enjoyed that one
          as well and would recommend it if you haven't read it yet :)

Review: Dash and Lily's Book of Dares

   [dashandlily.JPG]
   Title/Author:  Dash and Lily’s Book of Dares by Rachel Cohn and David
   Levithan
   Published: 2010, Knopf Books for Young Readers
   Source: Purchased myself at B&N
   Rating:  5 stars
   Summary (from Goodreads):
   “I’ve left some clues for you. If you want them, turn the page. If you
   don’t, put the book back on the shelf, please.”
   So begins the latest whirlwind romance from the New York Times
   bestselling authors of Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist. Lily has left
   a red notebook full of challenges on a favorite bookstore shelf,
   waiting for just the right guy to come along and accept its dares. But
   is Dash that right guy? Or are Dash and Lily only destined to trade
   dares, dreams, and desires in the notebook they pass back and forth at
   locations across New York? Could their in-person selves possibly
   connect as well as their notebook versions? Or will they be a comic
   mismatch of disastrous proportions?
   Review:
   After reading this book I am so tempted to get a notebook, scribble
   down a riddle and leave it in a bookstore next to a favorite book and
   cross my fingers that a cute (intelligent) guy comes along, finds the
   notebook and plays along.
   I loved the story.  Dash, while cynical, is the male equivalent of
   Jessica Darling.  Seriously, I think they’d be best friends.  He always
   has some witty remark.  Lily unintentionally isolates herself from
   people and just wants a friend.  She’s the captain and star athlete of
   her school’s soccer team yet doesn’t hang out with any of her
   teammates.
   Dash and Lily’s relationship kind of reminded me of my bookish
   community friends.  I’ve never met any of you, yet I kind of have an
   idea in my head what you all look like and sound like (and I don’t mean
   this is a creepy way!).  Then when I watch a vlog it throws me off a
   little.  Dash and Lily each had an idea of what the other one was like.
   What I loved about the book:
     * I laughed over the crimson alert and that entire ordeal.  Who knew
       throwing snowballs could be so dangerous?
     * Snarly.  To me describing someone as snarly means their hair is
       full of knots and desperately needs to be brushed.
     * I loved all of the dares and following Dash and Lily through New
       York City at Christmastime.
     * Dashiell.  What a great name.
     * Cover love.  Love love love the heart-shaped snowflakes on the
       cover.

   After writing this up I noticed I clearly favor Dash over Lily.  Even
   though Lily is also a main character more things about Dash stick out
   in my mind.
   I highly recommend this book!  It’s set during the holidays and its
   part of the story, but its not really a Christmas-y book.  So if you
   were looking for a sappy or sugar-sweet read for the holiday season
   then this probably isn’t the book for you.

Word Bit!

   [Word+Bit.jpg]
   Word Bit! is hosted by The Grammarian's Reviews.  Each week Alissa
   posts a new word she comes across in her reading and encourages others
   to post words they discovered recently.  I love learning new words so I
   love reading this feature every week.  I thought it was time to join in
   with my own word!
   To participate just post your word, where you saw it, the definition,
   why it caught your attention and anything else you'd like to include.
   Definitions from Dictionary.com
   QUADRILLE
   {noun}

   1. a square dance for four couples, consisting of five parts or
   movements, each complete in-itself.

   2. the music for such a dance.

   I came across the word quadrille while reading The Vespertine by
   Saundra Mitchell.  It stood out because I've never come across this
   word before and it looked interesting!  This is a word that has faded
   away with time.

   What interesting words have you come across this week?

          Thanks for participating this week, Jen! :D
          Quadrille is a fantastic word. And definitely not one I've ever
          encountered in reading. Now I kind of want to read the
          Vespertine to get a feel for it.
          Also, I haven't quite finished Twenty Boy Summer yet, but I love
          it so far!

          read it!! I love words that start in Q honestly. This is a great
          choice. Great to see that you did Word Bit!! It's my favorite
          new weekly meme :D

Review: Jumpstart the World

   [jumpstart.JPG]
   Title:  Jumpstart the World
   Author:  Catherine Ryan Hyde
   Published:  Knopf, October 2010
   How I Got It:  Purchased for my nook
   Rating: 5 stars
   Thoughts:
   Jumpstart the World by Catherine Ryan Hyde is fantastic read.  The book
   isn’t even 200 pages long but it is filled with so much emotion.
   You’ll feel happy, sad, grateful, encouraged, guilty, depressed but
   also inspired and ready the change the world.  Ultimately, I think this
   book is about acceptance and tolerance.
   Sixteen-year old Elle has just moved into her very first apartment, her
   only companion is the cat she just got from a shelter (she picked the
   least friendly cat out of the bunch).  Her mother’s new boyfriend
   doesn’t like teenagers so instead of kicking him to the curb Elle gets
   kicked out.  Her mother pays for the apartment (which is on the other
   side of town) and checks in every so often.
   The only neighbors Elle gets to know are Frank and his girlfriend,
   Molly.  They live in the apartment next to Elle and even share a fire
   escape.  Elle takes an instant liking to Frank.  She develops a crush
   on him and is devastated when she unexpectedly finds out that Frank is
   transgender.  He’s currently in the process of going from a female to a
   male.  Needless to say it came as quite a shock to Elle.  The last half
   of the book is about Elle dealing with the aftermath of finding out
   about Frank.  She's not really sure what to think about it or how to
   react to it.
   *One random fact about Elle:  Do not steal a cab from her, especially
   if she is upset about something.
   Lately I've been trying to write down my favorite quotes from books.
   These are my four favorite quotes from Jumpstart the World:

     "Words are important...words are the tools we use for making peace
     with the world" - Chapter 3

   “You’re supposed to make mistakes.  You’re just starting out.  Mistakes
   are a good thing.  They mean you were brave enough to try something
   hard” – Chapter 6

   “Sometimes you have to jumpstart the world just to get it to be what
   even the world admits it should be” – Chapter 12

   “I decided that not talking is like a litmus test for a real friend.
   You can just sit there and be.  Not always be filling up the air with
   words” – Chapter 14

   I loved this book.  I definitely think it is a must read for everyone.
   It’s a great story about learning to accept others even if they're
   different.  Plus there are funny chapter titles like, “The Heartbreak
   of Too Many Guys Named Bob” and “Mascara, and Other Things That Run”.
   Also, how is it that I have not read any of Catherine Ryan Hyde’s other
   books before?
   On Hyde's website she has Five Ways To Jumpstart The World listed.
   Please go take a look at them. She has some great ideas listed.

          Good sentences there! Sometimes, I wish I'd remember to stop and
          write down my favorite lines so I can use them in a review.
          Its even fun to be able to go back to a few lines in a book that
          you enjoyed, isn't it?
