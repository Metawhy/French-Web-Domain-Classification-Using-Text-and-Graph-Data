Tyler Shultz

   Whistle-blower, Theranos
   United States
   Biography

   The man who exposed the sensational fraud going on inside the once
   valued-at $10 billion blood-testing startup, Theranos.

   Tyler Shultz is an entrepreneur fostering innovation in healthcare. He
   graduated from Stanford with a Biology degree and entered the national
   scene when he courageously blew the whistle at Theranos. Tyler

   blood-testing practices. Owing to his role in exposing the fraud,
   Shultz was featured in Bad Blood, the book about the scandal penned by
   John Carreyrou, the original author of the Wall Street Journal
   articles, as well as in Alex Gibney’s HBO documentary

   The Inventor. Currently, Shultz is the CEO and Co-Founder of Flux
   Biosciences, Inc., a bay-area start-up. Flux Biosciences aims to bring
   medical grade diagnostics into the homes of consumers by using
   cutting-edge technology to measure biomarkers related to stress,
   exercise, and fertility. His e_orts were recognized by Forbes when he

   Bozoma Saint John

Bozoma Saint John

   CMO, Endeavor
   United States
   Biography

   The ex-Uber, uber-chic, rock star CMO who brought Beyoncé to Pepsi,
   headed up global marketing for iTunes and Apple Music, and now with LA
   Talent agency, Endeavor!

   Bozoma (“Boz”) Saint John is Chief Marketing Officer for Endeavor, a
   global leader in entertainment, sports and fashion. Operating in more
   than 30 countries, Endeavor is the parent of a number of subsidiaries
   with leadership positions in their respective industries, including
   WME, IMG and UFC. Collectively, Endeavor specializes in
   talent representation and management; brand strategy, activation and
   licensing; media sales and distribution; and event management.

   In her role, Saint John focuses on driving marketing efforts across
   Endeavor’s growing global network of companies, including Endeavor
   Global Marketing clients and premium brands.
   Over the course of her career, Saint John has earned a formidable
   reputation as a trailblazing marketing and advertising executive. She
   most recently served as Chief Brand Officer for Uber, where she was
   tasked with telling the stories of millions of riders and driver
   partners across 600+ cities. Prior to Uber, Saint John served as Head
   of Global Consumer Marketing for Apple Music and iTunes, spearheading
   campaigns geared towards growing consumer brand recognition, loyalty
   and equity around the world. She stole the show at Apple’s
   keynote World Wide Developers Conference when she introduced the new
   interface for Apple Music. Following the presentation, Buzzfeed called
   her the "coolest person to ever go on stage at an Apple event.”
   Before Apple, Saint John served as Head of the Music and Entertainment
   Marketing Group at Pepsi-Cola North America, where she drove
   breakthrough consumer engagement plans for brands across the soda
   giant’s beverages portfolio by engaging tastemaker-consumers. Prior to
   Pepsi, Saint John served as VP of Marketing for Ashley Stewart, a
   women’s fashion brand, as well as managed accounts at
   advertising agencies Arnold Worldwide and Spike Lee's SpikeDDB.
   Saint John was born in Middletown, CT, but spent her early childhood in
   Nairobi Kenya, Washington DC, and Accra Ghana, before immigrating to
   Colorado Springs, Colorado, when she was 12 years old. She received her
   Bachelor’s degree in English and African American Studies from Wesleyan
   University (at which she currently sits on the President’s Advisory
   Council).

   Iddris Sandu

Iddris Sandu

   Creative Architect
   United States
   Biography

   Google at 13; Snapchat to Instagram to Uber to Twitter at 19; honoured
   by President Obama; conceived the world’s first smart retail
   experience; and collaborated with Kanye West and Jaden Smith. He’s 22!

   Meet Iddris Sandu. The Ghana-born, Los Angeles-bred 22-year-old who is
   a bit of an anomaly.  At 13, he was shadowing at Google.

   By the age of 19, Everyone from individuals at Snapchat, Instagram,
   Uber have enlisted his unique design, coding skills, and youth centric
   viewpoints. In 2016, He was honored by President Obama.  In 2017, he
   conceived the world’s first smart retail experience, The Marathon
   Store, with the late rapper Nipsey Hussle. He was only still 19.

   Later, he would align with fellow creatives like Kanye West, and Jaden
   Smith for whom he would design an album cover, conceive stage design
   concepts alongside, and create augmented reality experiences. But if
   you asked him, he would tell you that he doesn't  define himself as a
   programmer ; he prefers the term "creative architect" - with a focus on
   design.

   When he's not designing  , he's spreading knowledge to the world
   through a method he likes to refer to as exposure ; a teaching which
   deals with the observation of the real-time. He has given a TedTalk at
   20, taught a class on bio-mimicral design at Apple at 21, and earlier
   this year delivered the commencement speech at NYU at just 22 years
   old. His featured plans circulate around unveiling a high-tech parking
   meter that will be released in 2020 as well as building a state of the
   art research facility in West Africa. It's clear that
   Iddris conveys a specific message for Gen-Z .

   To be so occupied building, that you won't have time to destroy.

   Bozoma Saint John

Bozoma Saint John

   CMO, Endeavor
   United States
   Biography

   The ex-Uber, uber-chic, rock star CMO who brought Beyoncé to Pepsi,
   headed up global marketing for iTunes and Apple Music, and now with LA
   Talent agency, Endeavor!

   Bozoma (“Boz”) Saint John is Chief Marketing Officer for Endeavor, a
   global leader in entertainment, sports and fashion. Operating in more
   than 30 countries, Endeavor is the parent of a number of subsidiaries
   with leadership positions in their respective industries, including
   WME, IMG and UFC. Collectively, Endeavor specializes in
   talent representation and management; brand strategy, activation and
   licensing; media sales and distribution; and event management.

   In her role, Saint John focuses on driving marketing efforts across
   Endeavor’s growing global network of companies, including Endeavor
   Global Marketing clients and premium brands.
   Over the course of her career, Saint John has earned a formidable
   reputation as a trailblazing marketing and advertising executive. She
   most recently served as Chief Brand Officer for Uber, where she was
   tasked with telling the stories of millions of riders and driver
   partners across 600+ cities. Prior to Uber, Saint John served as Head
   of Global Consumer Marketing for Apple Music and iTunes, spearheading
   campaigns geared towards growing consumer brand recognition, loyalty
   and equity around the world. She stole the show at Apple’s
   keynote World Wide Developers Conference when she introduced the new
   interface for Apple Music. Following the presentation, Buzzfeed called
   her the "coolest person to ever go on stage at an Apple event.”
   Before Apple, Saint John served as Head of the Music and Entertainment
   Marketing Group at Pepsi-Cola North America, where she drove
   breakthrough consumer engagement plans for brands across the soda
   giant’s beverages portfolio by engaging tastemaker-consumers. Prior to
   Pepsi, Saint John served as VP of Marketing for Ashley Stewart, a
   women’s fashion brand, as well as managed accounts at
   advertising agencies Arnold Worldwide and Spike Lee's SpikeDDB.
   Saint John was born in Middletown, CT, but spent her early childhood in
   Nairobi Kenya, Washington DC, and Accra Ghana, before immigrating to
   Colorado Springs, Colorado, when she was 12 years old. She received her
   Bachelor’s degree in English and African American Studies from Wesleyan
   University (at which she currently sits on the President’s Advisory
   Council).

Iddris Sandu

   Creative Architect
   United States
   Biography

   Google at 13; Snapchat to Instagram to Uber to Twitter at 19; honoured
   by President Obama; conceived the world’s first smart retail
   experience; and collaborated with Kanye West and Jaden Smith. He’s 22!

   Meet Iddris Sandu. The Ghana-born, Los Angeles-bred 22-year-old who is
   a bit of an anomaly.  At 13, he was shadowing at Google.

   By the age of 19, Everyone from individuals at Snapchat, Instagram,
   Uber have enlisted his unique design, coding skills, and youth centric
   viewpoints. In 2016, He was honored by President Obama.  In 2017, he
   conceived the world’s first smart retail experience, The Marathon
   Store, with the late rapper Nipsey Hussle. He was only still 19.

   Later, he would align with fellow creatives like Kanye West, and Jaden
   Smith for whom he would design an album cover, conceive stage design
   concepts alongside, and create augmented reality experiences. But if
   you asked him, he would tell you that he doesn't  define himself as a
   programmer ; he prefers the term "creative architect" - with a focus on
   design.

   When he's not designing  , he's spreading knowledge to the world
   through a method he likes to refer to as exposure ; a teaching which
   deals with the observation of the real-time. He has given a TedTalk at
   20, taught a class on bio-mimicral design at Apple at 21, and earlier
   this year delivered the commencement speech at NYU at just 22 years
   old. His featured plans circulate around unveiling a high-tech parking
   meter that will be released in 2020 as well as building a state of the
   art research facility in West Africa. It's clear that
   Iddris conveys a specific message for Gen-Z .

   To be so occupied building, that you won't have time to destroy.
