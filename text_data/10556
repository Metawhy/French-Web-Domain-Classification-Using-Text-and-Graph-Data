1. Main points

     * The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion
       to £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to
       falling imports of goods.
     * Imports of goods decreased £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in
       Quarter 2 2019 as imports of unspecified goods (including
       non-monetary gold), chemicals, and machinery and transport
       equipment fell, following sharp rises in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar)
       2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to £4.0 billion in Quarter 2
       2019, as imports from EU countries fell following sharp rises in
       Quarter 1 2019.
     * Removing the effect of inflation, the total trade deficit narrowed
       £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       total trade balance remained in deficit at £0.6 billion in June
       2019; however, including unspecified goods (including non-monetary
       gold), total trade returned a surplus of £1.8 billion.
     * The total trade deficit widened £19.9 billion to £42.8 billion in
       the 12 months to June 2019, due mainly to the trade in goods
       deficit, which widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion; the
       services surplus narrowed by a lesser £5.5 billion to £106.4
       billion.

2. Things you need to know about this release

Data revision policy

   In accordance with National Accounts Revisions Policy, data in this
   release have been revised back to April 2019 when compared with our
   previous trade bulletin from 10 July 2019. Data in this release are
   consistent with the GDP first quarterly estimate for Quarter 2 (Apr to
   June) 2019 also published on 9 August 2019.

National Statistics designation status

   The UK Statistics Authority suspended the National Statistics
   designation of UK trade (PDF 72.8KB) on 14 November 2014. We have now
   responded to all of the specific requirements of the reassessment of UK
   trade and are in the final stages of providing evidence to the
   Authority.

   We are undertaking a programme of improvements to UK trade statistics
   in line with the UK trade development plan, including more detail and
   improvements now published to address anticipated future demands. On 24
   October 2018, we published an article outlining our achievements so far
   and forward look with regards to the transformation of our trade
   statistics.

   We continue to work with the Office for Statistics Regulation team to
   regain National Statistics status for UK trade statistics. We welcome
   feedback on our new trade statistics, developments and future plans. If
   you have any comments, please send them by email to trade@ons.gov.uk.

UK trade data

   Unless otherwise specified, data within this bulletin are in current
   prices, in other words, they have not been adjusted to remove the
   effects of inflation.

   UK trade data within our monthly trade bulletin are published at around
   a six-week lag because of the timeliness of source data. For example,
   the August 2019 publication will include data up to the end of June
   2019.

Erratic commodities

   Trade statistics for any one month can be erratic. For that reason, we
   recommend comparing the latest three months against the preceding three
   months, and the same three months of the previous year.

   Oil and other “erratic” commodities can make a large contribution to
   trade in goods, but often mask the underlying trend in the export or
   import values due to their volatility. The “erratics” series includes
   ships, aircraft, precious stones, silver and non-monetary gold.
   Non-monetary gold can have a particularly large impact because of the
   large volumes of gold traded on the London markets. Therefore, we also
   publish data exclusive of these commodities, which may provide a better
   guide to the emerging trade picture.

Non-monetary gold

   In line with international standards, the Office for National
   Statistics’ (ONS’s) headline trade statistics contain the UK’s exports
   and imports of non-monetary gold. Non-monetary gold is the technical
   term for gold bullion not owned by central banks.

   Because a significant amount of the world’s trade in non-monetary gold
   takes place on the London markets, this trade can have a large impact
   on the size of and change in the UK’s headline trade figures.

   Non-monetary gold is one subcomponent of the commodity group
   “unspecified goods”.

   More information about the ONS’s recording of non-monetary gold is
   available.

Trade asymmetries

   These data are our best estimates of bilateral UK trade flows, compiled
   following internationally agreed standards and using a wide range of
   robust data sources. However, in some cases alternative estimates of
   bilateral trade flows are available from the statistical agencies for
   those countries or through central databases such as UN Comtrade.
   Differences between estimates are known as trade asymmetries and are a
   known aspect of international trade statistics, affecting bilateral
   estimates across the globe, not just the UK.

   We are heavily engaged in analysis of these asymmetries, developing
   strong bilateral relationships with other countries to understand,
   explain and potentially reduce them. We have published a series of
   analyses showing comparisons and the relative strengths of different
   estimates, which users may wish to reference to help them better
   understand the quality of our bilateral trade estimates.

Blue Book 2019

   Each year we produce an annual update to the UK National Accounts in
   the Blue Book and Pink Book and the associated releases. As already
   announced, the Blue Book and Pink Book 2019 consistent datasets will be
   published on 30 September 2019.

   Details have already been provided on the scope in the article Latest
   developments and changes to be implemented in Blue Book and Pink Book
   2019. Indicative impacts on headline gross domestic product (GDP)
   components for the years 1997 to 2016 were published on 27 June 2019 in
   the article Blue Book 2019 indicative impacts on GDP current price and
   chained volume measure estimates: 1997 to 2016.

   This year, due to the very demanding set of changes being put through
   in the annual update, we are not going to fully reconcile 2017 annual
   data, instead producing an indicative balance to allow further time for
   final quality assurance of the data.

   Consequently, the reference year and last base year for all chained
   volume measure series will remain as 2016.

3. Total trade deficit narrowed £16.0 billion in Quarter 2 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion to
   £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to goods
   imports, which fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion (Figure 1).

   Much of the fall in Quarter 2 2019 was due to falling imports of
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), chemicals, and
   machinery and transport equipment, following increased imports into
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019.

       movement has on the trade balance.
    2. For example, an increase in imports is denoted by an upward red
       arrow, as a rise in imports has a negative impact on the trade
       balance. An increase in the trade in goods deficit will be

   The trade in goods deficit narrowed £16.6 billion to £30.4 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 while the services surplus narrowed £0.6 billion to
   £26.2 billion (Figure 2). Imports of unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold) were a large driver in the narrowing of the trade in
   goods balance in Quarter 2. Excluding unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold), the total trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to
   £4.0 billion, as imports of goods fell more than exports.

4. Excluding unspecified goods, goods imports fell £10.7 billion in Quarter 2
2019 following increases in Quarter 1 2019

   Excluding unspecified goods, exports and imports of goods fell in
   Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019 following increases into Quarter 1 (Jan to
   Mar) 2019 (Figure 3).

   Imports of goods fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, driving the narrowing of the total trade deficit. Excluding
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), imports fell £10.7
   billion to £117.0 billion on the quarter.

   Goods exports fell £1.4 billion to £89.6 billion. Excluding unspecified
   goods (including non-monetary gold), exports fell £3.8 billion to £86.8
   billion.

   Falls in imports in Quarter 2 2019, following the increases in Quarter
   1 2019, are consistent with activity being brought forward ahead of the
   UK’s originally intended departure date from the European Union, but we
   are unable to quantify the effect of this. Similar activity has been
   seen elsewhere in the economy, for further information see GDP first
   quarterly estimate, UK: April to June 2019.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) fell £7.3
   billion in Quarter 2 2019 (Figure 4), due largely to falling imports of
   non-monetary gold from non-EU countries.

   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), EU countries
   drove falling imports in Quarter 2 2019. Chemical imports fell £4.3
   billion in the quarter, £2.5 billion of which was due to falling
   imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from EU countries.
   These falls in imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products
   followed increased imports in Quarter 1 2019.

   Imports of machinery and transport equipment fell £3.8 billion, £2.9
   billion of which was driven by falling imports of road vehicles and
   electrical machinery from EU countries.

   Rises in exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) to
   non-EU countries partially offset falls in exports of machinery and
   transport equipment, and chemicals to EU countries (Figure 5).
   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), exports of
   goods fell £3.8 billion to £86.8 billion in Quarter 2 2019.

   Exports of machinery and transport equipment fell £2.9 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 due largely to exports to the EU falling £2.0 billion.
   Falls in exports in this commodity grouping were broad-based with the
   largest contributors being mechanical machinery and road vehicles.

   Chemical exports fell £1.9 billion in Quarter 2 2019, £1.4 billion of
   which was due to falling exports to EU countries. Exports of medicinal
   and pharmaceutical products to the EU fell £0.8 billion on the quarter.

   Similar to imports, falling exports in Quarter 2 2019 were consistent
   with activity being brought forward in Quarter 1 2019 ahead of the UK’s
   originally intended departure from the European Union. While the
   monthly path for exports increased into March 2019, the increase into
   March and subsequent fall in April 2019 was smaller than that for
   imports.

5. Removing the effect of inflation, the trade deficit narrowed £17.2 billion
in Quarter 2 2019

   This section presents volume and price estimates of UK trade exports,
   imports and balances, using chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied
   deflators (IDEFs). A CVM is a “real” measure in that it has had the
   effect of inflation removed. An IDEF shows the implied change in
   average prices for the respective components of the trade balance, for
   example, the IDEF for imports will show the average price movement for
   imports.

   In volume terms, the total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed
   £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, as the
   trade in goods deficit narrowed £17.7 billion to £29.8 billion and the
   trade in services surplus narrowed £0.5 billion to £25.4 billion
   (Figure 6).

   Goods exports decreased £3.0 billion to £79.5 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, while goods imports fell by a greater £20.7 billion to £109.3
   billion.

   Services exports fell £2.1 billion to £66.9 billion, while services
   imports fell by £1.6 billion to £41.5 billion.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) from non-EU
   countries drove the narrowing of the trade deficit in volume terms in
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, along with falling imports of chemicals,
   and machinery and transport equipment from EU countries.

   The trade deficit narrowed more in volumes than in current prices in
   Quarter 2 2019 as import prices on average grew by more than export
   prices, following falls in both in Quarter 1 2019. Import prices
   increased 2.6% on average on the quarter, compared with 1.2% for export
   prices. Increases in import and export prices were driven largely by
   fuels. The implied deflators for fuels increased 12.7% for exports and
   14.2% for imports on the quarter.

a narrowing of the trade in goods deficit

7. The total trade deficit widened in the 12 months to June 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) widened £19.9 billion to
   £42.8 billion in the 12 months to June 2019, due largely to widening of
   the trade in goods deficit (Figure 7).

   The trade in goods deficit widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion in
   the 12 months to June 2019, as imports of goods increased £29.3 billion
   to £508.1 billion compared with exports, which rose by a lesser £14.9
   billion to £358.9 billion.

   The largest contributor to the increase in exports was fuels, which
   increased £7.1 billion. The increase in imports was driven primarily by
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), machinery and
   transport equipment, and fuels, which rose £9.5 billion, £5.3 billion
   and £4.6 billion respectively.

   The trade in services surplus narrowed £5.5 billion to £106.4 billion
   in the 12 months to June 2019, as imports increased £12.4 billion to
   £181.6 billion, while exports grew by a lesser £6.9 billion to £288.0
   billion. The main contributors to the increase in imports of services
   were other business, financial and travel services.

       movement has on the trade balance.
    2. For example, an increase in imports is denoted by an upward red
       arrow, as a rise in imports has a negative impact on the trade

8. The trade in goods deficit widened with non-EU countries and narrowed with
EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019

   The £14.4 billion widening in the trade in goods deficit in the 12
   months to June 2019 was due mainly to trade with non-EU countries
   (Figure 8). The trade in goods deficit widened £14.9 billion to £55.9
   billion with non-EU countries and narrowed £0.5 billion to £93.4
   billion with EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019.

   The widening of the trade in goods deficit with non-EU countries in the
   12 months to June 2019 was due mainly to imports, which increased £24.5
   billion, while exports increased by a lesser £9.6 billion.

   The largest contributors to the increase in imports from non-EU
   countries were unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), fuels,
   and machinery and transport equipment, which increased £9.7 billion,
   £5.7 billion and £4.1 billion respectively.

   Increased exports to non-EU countries were driven by increases in
   exports of fuels, unspecified goods and miscellaneous manufactures,
   which increased £2.9 billion, £2.1 billion and £2.1 billion
   respectively.

9. Links to related statistics

   On 31 July 2019, we published Modes of supply, UK experimental
   estimates: 2018. This release contains the first exploratory estimates
   of UK trade in services broken down by mode of supply, showing how
   services trade is conducted, in addition to what is traded and with
   whom. The UK is one of the first countries to have developed such
   estimates.

   On 24 July 2019, we published UK trade in services by partner country:
   January to March 2019. Alongside this release we published a dataset
   containing UK total trade, goods and services by partner country up to
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, providing a geographical breakdown of the
   most recent and consistent UK trade estimates.

   On 15 May 2019, we published UK trade in services by industry, country
   and service type, presenting a new experimental dataset for trade in
   services by industry, country and service type on a balance of payments
   basis.

   On 24 April 2019, we published UK trade in goods by industry, country
   and commodity: 2008 to 2017, presenting an updated experimental dataset
   for UK trade in goods by industry, country and commodity on a balance
   of payments basis.

   On 29 January 2019, we published New frontiers in trade analysis, which
   summarises recent developments in UK goods and services statistics and
   examines, using our more granular trade in goods data, recent trends in
   UK trade of road vehicles.

   On 24 October 2018, we published UK trade statistics transformation:
   achievements and forward look, which summarises our transformation of
   UK trade statistics, highlighting the delivery of new detail and
   analysis and the focus of ongoing developments.

   On 24 October 2018, we published Estimating the value of service
   exports abroad from different parts of the UK: 2011 to 2016, which
   provides a breakdown of services exports by functional category from
   the nine English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

   On 24 September 2018, we published Why has the UK trade in goods
   deficit widened in real terms?. The article uses our new country by
   commodity data to look at the UK trade in goods deficit over the past
   20 years and highlights which countries and commodities have been
   behind the growth of the deficit.

   On 6 July 2018, we published UK trade in goods and productivity: new
   findings. This article describes a new dataset we have developed, which
   includes information from both the Annual Business Survey and HM
   Revenue and Customs’ trade in goods administrative data. It shows a
   strong association between trader status and productivity, highlighting
   the prevalence of trading behaviour across different types of business.

   Supplementary quarterly data analysed by product according to the UK
   trade in goods by classification of product by activity (CPA 2008) are
   also available.

10. Quality and methodology

   Trade is measured through both exports and imports of goods and
   services. Data are supplied by over 30 sources including several
   administrative sources, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) being the largest
   for trade in goods.

   This monthly release contains tables showing the total value of trade
   in goods together with chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied
   deflators (IDEFs). Figures are analysed by broad commodity group (CP,
   CVMs and IDEFs) and according to geographical area (CP only). In
   addition, the UK trade statistical bulletin also includes early monthly
   estimates of the value of trade in services.

   Further qualitative data and information can be found in the attached
   datasets. This includes data on:
     * response rates
     * revision triangles

   Detailed methodological notes are published in the UK Balance of
   Payments, The Pink Book 2018.

   The UK trade methodology web pages have been developed to provide
   detailed information about the methods used to produce UK trade
   statistics.

   The UK trade Quality and Methodology Information report contains
   important information on:
     * the strengths and limitations of the data and how it compares with
       related data
     * uses and users of the data
     * how the output was created
     * the quality of the output including the accuracy of the data

1. Main points

     * The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion
       to £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to
       falling imports of goods.
     * Imports of goods decreased £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in
       Quarter 2 2019 as imports of unspecified goods (including
       non-monetary gold), chemicals, and machinery and transport
       equipment fell, following sharp rises in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar)
       2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to £4.0 billion in Quarter 2
       2019, as imports from EU countries fell following sharp rises in
       Quarter 1 2019.
     * Removing the effect of inflation, the total trade deficit narrowed
       £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       total trade balance remained in deficit at £0.6 billion in June
       2019; however, including unspecified goods (including non-monetary
       gold), total trade returned a surplus of £1.8 billion.
     * The total trade deficit widened £19.9 billion to £42.8 billion in
       the 12 months to June 2019, due mainly to the trade in goods
       deficit, which widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion; the
       services surplus narrowed by a lesser £5.5 billion to £106.4
       billion.

2. Things you need to know about this release

Data revision policy

   In accordance with National Accounts Revisions Policy, data in this
   release have been revised back to April 2019 when compared with our
   previous trade bulletin from 10 July 2019. Data in this release are
   consistent with the GDP first quarterly estimate for Quarter 2 (Apr to
   June) 2019 also published on 9 August 2019.

National Statistics designation status

   The UK Statistics Authority suspended the National Statistics
   designation of UK trade (PDF 72.8KB) on 14 November 2014. We have now
   responded to all of the specific requirements of the reassessment of UK
   trade and are in the final stages of providing evidence to the
   Authority.

   We are undertaking a programme of improvements to UK trade statistics
   in line with the UK trade development plan, including more detail and
   improvements now published to address anticipated future demands. On 24
   October 2018, we published an article outlining our achievements so far
   and forward look with regards to the transformation of our trade
   statistics.

   We continue to work with the Office for Statistics Regulation team to
   regain National Statistics status for UK trade statistics. We welcome
   feedback on our new trade statistics, developments and future plans. If
   you have any comments, please send them by email to trade@ons.gov.uk.

UK trade data

   Unless otherwise specified, data within this bulletin are in current
   prices, in other words, they have not been adjusted to remove the
   effects of inflation.

   UK trade data within our monthly trade bulletin are published at around
   a six-week lag because of the timeliness of source data. For example,
   the August 2019 publication will include data up to the end of June
   2019.

Erratic commodities

   Trade statistics for any one month can be erratic. For that reason, we
   recommend comparing the latest three months against the preceding three
   months, and the same three months of the previous year.

   Oil and other “erratic” commodities can make a large contribution to
   trade in goods, but often mask the underlying trend in the export or
   import values due to their volatility. The “erratics” series includes
   ships, aircraft, precious stones, silver and non-monetary gold.
   Non-monetary gold can have a particularly large impact because of the
   large volumes of gold traded on the London markets. Therefore, we also
   publish data exclusive of these commodities, which may provide a better
   guide to the emerging trade picture.

Non-monetary gold

   In line with international standards, the Office for National
   Statistics’ (ONS’s) headline trade statistics contain the UK’s exports
   and imports of non-monetary gold. Non-monetary gold is the technical
   term for gold bullion not owned by central banks.

   Because a significant amount of the world’s trade in non-monetary gold
   takes place on the London markets, this trade can have a large impact
   on the size of and change in the UK’s headline trade figures.

   Non-monetary gold is one subcomponent of the commodity group
   “unspecified goods”.

   More information about the ONS’s recording of non-monetary gold is
   available.

Trade asymmetries

   These data are our best estimates of bilateral UK trade flows, compiled
   following internationally agreed standards and using a wide range of
   robust data sources. However, in some cases alternative estimates of
   bilateral trade flows are available from the statistical agencies for
   those countries or through central databases such as UN Comtrade.
   Differences between estimates are known as trade asymmetries and are a
   known aspect of international trade statistics, affecting bilateral
   estimates across the globe, not just the UK.

   We are heavily engaged in analysis of these asymmetries, developing
   strong bilateral relationships with other countries to understand,
   explain and potentially reduce them. We have published a series of
   analyses showing comparisons and the relative strengths of different
   estimates, which users may wish to reference to help them better
   understand the quality of our bilateral trade estimates.

Blue Book 2019

   Each year we produce an annual update to the UK National Accounts in
   the Blue Book and Pink Book and the associated releases. As already
   announced, the Blue Book and Pink Book 2019 consistent datasets will be
   published on 30 September 2019.

   Details have already been provided on the scope in the article Latest
   developments and changes to be implemented in Blue Book and Pink Book
   2019. Indicative impacts on headline gross domestic product (GDP)
   components for the years 1997 to 2016 were published on 27 June 2019 in
   the article Blue Book 2019 indicative impacts on GDP current price and
   chained volume measure estimates: 1997 to 2016.

   This year, due to the very demanding set of changes being put through
   in the annual update, we are not going to fully reconcile 2017 annual
   data, instead producing an indicative balance to allow further time for
   final quality assurance of the data.

   Consequently, the reference year and last base year for all chained
   volume measure series will remain as 2016.

3. Total trade deficit narrowed £16.0 billion in Quarter 2 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion to
   £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to goods
   imports, which fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion (Figure 1).

   Much of the fall in Quarter 2 2019 was due to falling imports of
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), chemicals, and
   machinery and transport equipment, following increased imports into
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019.

   The trade in goods deficit narrowed £16.6 billion to £30.4 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 while the services surplus narrowed £0.6 billion to
   £26.2 billion (Figure 2). Imports of unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold) were a large driver in the narrowing of the trade in
   goods balance in Quarter 2. Excluding unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold), the total trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to
   £4.0 billion, as imports of goods fell more than exports.

4. Excluding unspecified goods, goods imports fell £10.7 billion in Quarter 2
2019 following increases in Quarter 1 2019

   Excluding unspecified goods, exports and imports of goods fell in
   Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019 following increases into Quarter 1 (Jan to
   Mar) 2019 (Figure 3).

   Imports of goods fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, driving the narrowing of the total trade deficit. Excluding
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), imports fell £10.7
   billion to £117.0 billion on the quarter.

   Goods exports fell £1.4 billion to £89.6 billion. Excluding unspecified
   goods (including non-monetary gold), exports fell £3.8 billion to £86.8
   billion.

   Falls in imports in Quarter 2 2019, following the increases in Quarter
   1 2019, are consistent with activity being brought forward ahead of the
   UK’s originally intended departure date from the European Union, but we
   are unable to quantify the effect of this. Similar activity has been
   seen elsewhere in the economy, for further information see GDP first
   quarterly estimate, UK: April to June 2019.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) fell £7.3
   billion in Quarter 2 2019 (Figure 4), due largely to falling imports of
   non-monetary gold from non-EU countries.

   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), EU countries
   drove falling imports in Quarter 2 2019. Chemical imports fell £4.3
   billion in the quarter, £2.5 billion of which was due to falling
   imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from EU countries.
   These falls in imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products
   followed increased imports in Quarter 1 2019.

   Imports of machinery and transport equipment fell £3.8 billion, £2.9
   billion of which was driven by falling imports of road vehicles and
   electrical machinery from EU countries.

   Rises in exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) to
   non-EU countries partially offset falls in exports of machinery and
   transport equipment, and chemicals to EU countries (Figure 5).
   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), exports of
   goods fell £3.8 billion to £86.8 billion in Quarter 2 2019.

   Exports of machinery and transport equipment fell £2.9 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 due largely to exports to the EU falling £2.0 billion.
   Falls in exports in this commodity grouping were broad-based with the
   largest contributors being mechanical machinery and road vehicles.

   Chemical exports fell £1.9 billion in Quarter 2 2019, £1.4 billion of
   which was due to falling exports to EU countries. Exports of medicinal
   and pharmaceutical products to the EU fell £0.8 billion on the quarter.

   Similar to imports, falling exports in Quarter 2 2019 were consistent
   with activity being brought forward in Quarter 1 2019 ahead of the UK’s
   originally intended departure from the European Union. While the
   monthly path for exports increased into March 2019, the increase into
   March and subsequent fall in April 2019 was smaller than that for
   imports.

5. Removing the effect of inflation, the trade deficit narrowed £17.2 billion
in Quarter 2 2019

   This section presents volume and price estimates of UK trade exports,
   imports and balances, using chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied
   deflators (IDEFs). A CVM is a “real” measure in that it has had the
   effect of inflation removed. An IDEF shows the implied change in
   average prices for the respective components of the trade balance, for
   example, the IDEF for imports will show the average price movement for
   imports.

   In volume terms, the total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed
   £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, as the
   trade in goods deficit narrowed £17.7 billion to £29.8 billion and the
   trade in services surplus narrowed £0.5 billion to £25.4 billion
   (Figure 6).

   Goods exports decreased £3.0 billion to £79.5 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, while goods imports fell by a greater £20.7 billion to £109.3
   billion.

   Services exports fell £2.1 billion to £66.9 billion, while services
   imports fell by £1.6 billion to £41.5 billion.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) from non-EU
   countries drove the narrowing of the trade deficit in volume terms in
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, along with falling imports of chemicals,
   and machinery and transport equipment from EU countries.

   The trade deficit narrowed more in volumes than in current prices in
   Quarter 2 2019 as import prices on average grew by more than export
   prices, following falls in both in Quarter 1 2019. Import prices
   increased 2.6% on average on the quarter, compared with 1.2% for export
   prices. Increases in import and export prices were driven largely by
   fuels. The implied deflators for fuels increased 12.7% for exports and
   14.2% for imports on the quarter.

a narrowing of the trade in goods deficit

7. The total trade deficit widened in the 12 months to June 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) widened £19.9 billion to
   £42.8 billion in the 12 months to June 2019, due largely to widening of
   the trade in goods deficit (Figure 7).

   The trade in goods deficit widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion in
   the 12 months to June 2019, as imports of goods increased £29.3 billion
   to £508.1 billion compared with exports, which rose by a lesser £14.9
   billion to £358.9 billion.

   The largest contributor to the increase in exports was fuels, which
   increased £7.1 billion. The increase in imports was driven primarily by
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), machinery and
   transport equipment, and fuels, which rose £9.5 billion, £5.3 billion
   and £4.6 billion respectively.

   The trade in services surplus narrowed £5.5 billion to £106.4 billion
   in the 12 months to June 2019, as imports increased £12.4 billion to
   £181.6 billion, while exports grew by a lesser £6.9 billion to £288.0
   billion. The main contributors to the increase in imports of services
   were other business, financial and travel services.

8. The trade in goods deficit widened with non-EU countries and narrowed with
EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019

   The £14.4 billion widening in the trade in goods deficit in the 12
   months to June 2019 was due mainly to trade with non-EU countries
   (Figure 8). The trade in goods deficit widened £14.9 billion to £55.9
   billion with non-EU countries and narrowed £0.5 billion to £93.4
   billion with EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019.

   The widening of the trade in goods deficit with non-EU countries in the
   12 months to June 2019 was due mainly to imports, which increased £24.5
   billion, while exports increased by a lesser £9.6 billion.

   The largest contributors to the increase in imports from non-EU
   countries were unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), fuels,
   and machinery and transport equipment, which increased £9.7 billion,
   £5.7 billion and £4.1 billion respectively.

   Increased exports to non-EU countries were driven by increases in
   exports of fuels, unspecified goods and miscellaneous manufactures,
   which increased £2.9 billion, £2.1 billion and £2.1 billion
   respectively.

9. Links to related statistics

   On 31 July 2019, we published Modes of supply, UK experimental
   estimates: 2018. This release contains the first exploratory estimates
   of UK trade in services broken down by mode of supply, showing how
   services trade is conducted, in addition to what is traded and with
   whom. The UK is one of the first countries to have developed such
   estimates.

   On 24 July 2019, we published UK trade in services by partner country:
   January to March 2019. Alongside this release we published a dataset
   containing UK total trade, goods and services by partner country up to
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, providing a geographical breakdown of the
   most recent and consistent UK trade estimates.

   On 15 May 2019, we published UK trade in services by industry, country
   and service type, presenting a new experimental dataset for trade in
   services by industry, country and service type on a balance of payments
   basis.

   On 24 April 2019, we published UK trade in goods by industry, country
   and commodity: 2008 to 2017, presenting an updated experimental dataset
   for UK trade in goods by industry, country and commodity on a balance
   of payments basis.

   On 29 January 2019, we published New frontiers in trade analysis, which
   summarises recent developments in UK goods and services statistics and
   examines, using our more granular trade in goods data, recent trends in
   UK trade of road vehicles.

   On 24 October 2018, we published UK trade statistics transformation:
   achievements and forward look, which summarises our transformation of
   UK trade statistics, highlighting the delivery of new detail and
   analysis and the focus of ongoing developments.

   On 24 October 2018, we published Estimating the value of service
   exports abroad from different parts of the UK: 2011 to 2016, which
   provides a breakdown of services exports by functional category from
   the nine English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

   On 24 September 2018, we published Why has the UK trade in goods
   deficit widened in real terms?. The article uses our new country by
   commodity data to look at the UK trade in goods deficit over the past
   20 years and highlights which countries and commodities have been
   behind the growth of the deficit.

   On 6 July 2018, we published UK trade in goods and productivity: new
   findings. This article describes a new dataset we have developed, which
   includes information from both the Annual Business Survey and HM
   Revenue and Customs’ trade in goods administrative data. It shows a
   strong association between trader status and productivity, highlighting
   the prevalence of trading behaviour across different types of business.

   Supplementary quarterly data analysed by product according to the UK
   trade in goods by classification of product by activity (CPA 2008) are
   also available.

10. Quality and methodology

   Trade is measured through both exports and imports of goods and
   services. Data are supplied by over 30 sources including several
   administrative sources, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) being the largest
   for trade in goods.

   This monthly release contains tables showing the total value of trade
   in goods together with chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied

1. Main points

     * The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion
       to £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to
       falling imports of goods.
     * Imports of goods decreased £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in
       Quarter 2 2019 as imports of unspecified goods (including
       non-monetary gold), chemicals, and machinery and transport
       equipment fell, following sharp rises in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar)
       2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to £4.0 billion in Quarter 2
       2019, as imports from EU countries fell following sharp rises in
       Quarter 1 2019.
     * Removing the effect of inflation, the total trade deficit narrowed
       £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       total trade balance remained in deficit at £0.6 billion in June
       2019; however, including unspecified goods (including non-monetary
       gold), total trade returned a surplus of £1.8 billion.
     * The total trade deficit widened £19.9 billion to £42.8 billion in
       the 12 months to June 2019, due mainly to the trade in goods
       deficit, which widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion; the
       services surplus narrowed by a lesser £5.5 billion to £106.4
       billion.

Data revision policy

   In accordance with National Accounts Revisions Policy, data in this
   release have been revised back to April 2019 when compared with our
   previous trade bulletin from 10 July 2019. Data in this release are
   consistent with the GDP first quarterly estimate for Quarter 2 (Apr to
   June) 2019 also published on 9 August 2019.

National Statistics designation status

   The UK Statistics Authority suspended the National Statistics
   designation of UK trade (PDF 72.8KB) on 14 November 2014. We have now
   responded to all of the specific requirements of the reassessment of UK
   trade and are in the final stages of providing evidence to the
   Authority.

   We are undertaking a programme of improvements to UK trade statistics
   in line with the UK trade development plan, including more detail and
   improvements now published to address anticipated future demands. On 24
   October 2018, we published an article outlining our achievements so far
   and forward look with regards to the transformation of our trade
   statistics.

   We continue to work with the Office for Statistics Regulation team to
   regain National Statistics status for UK trade statistics. We welcome
   feedback on our new trade statistics, developments and future plans. If
   you have any comments, please send them by email to trade@ons.gov.uk.

UK trade data

   Unless otherwise specified, data within this bulletin are in current
   prices, in other words, they have not been adjusted to remove the
   effects of inflation.

   UK trade data within our monthly trade bulletin are published at around
   a six-week lag because of the timeliness of source data. For example,
   the August 2019 publication will include data up to the end of June
   2019.

Erratic commodities

   Trade statistics for any one month can be erratic. For that reason, we
   recommend comparing the latest three months against the preceding three
   months, and the same three months of the previous year.

   Oil and other “erratic” commodities can make a large contribution to
   trade in goods, but often mask the underlying trend in the export or
   import values due to their volatility. The “erratics” series includes
   ships, aircraft, precious stones, silver and non-monetary gold.
   Non-monetary gold can have a particularly large impact because of the
   large volumes of gold traded on the London markets. Therefore, we also
   publish data exclusive of these commodities, which may provide a better
   guide to the emerging trade picture.

Non-monetary gold

   In line with international standards, the Office for National
   Statistics’ (ONS’s) headline trade statistics contain the UK’s exports
   and imports of non-monetary gold. Non-monetary gold is the technical
   term for gold bullion not owned by central banks.

   Because a significant amount of the world’s trade in non-monetary gold
   takes place on the London markets, this trade can have a large impact
   on the size of and change in the UK’s headline trade figures.

   Non-monetary gold is one subcomponent of the commodity group
   “unspecified goods”.

   More information about the ONS’s recording of non-monetary gold is
   available.

Trade asymmetries

   These data are our best estimates of bilateral UK trade flows, compiled
   following internationally agreed standards and using a wide range of
   robust data sources. However, in some cases alternative estimates of
   bilateral trade flows are available from the statistical agencies for
   those countries or through central databases such as UN Comtrade.
   Differences between estimates are known as trade asymmetries and are a
   known aspect of international trade statistics, affecting bilateral
   estimates across the globe, not just the UK.

   We are heavily engaged in analysis of these asymmetries, developing
   strong bilateral relationships with other countries to understand,
   explain and potentially reduce them. We have published a series of
   analyses showing comparisons and the relative strengths of different
   estimates, which users may wish to reference to help them better
   understand the quality of our bilateral trade estimates.

Blue Book 2019

   Each year we produce an annual update to the UK National Accounts in
   the Blue Book and Pink Book and the associated releases. As already
   announced, the Blue Book and Pink Book 2019 consistent datasets will be
   published on 30 September 2019.

   Details have already been provided on the scope in the article Latest
   developments and changes to be implemented in Blue Book and Pink Book
   2019. Indicative impacts on headline gross domestic product (GDP)
   components for the years 1997 to 2016 were published on 27 June 2019 in
   the article Blue Book 2019 indicative impacts on GDP current price and
   chained volume measure estimates: 1997 to 2016.

   This year, due to the very demanding set of changes being put through
   in the annual update, we are not going to fully reconcile 2017 annual
   data, instead producing an indicative balance to allow further time for
   final quality assurance of the data.

   Consequently, the reference year and last base year for all chained
   volume measure series will remain as 2016.

3. Total trade deficit narrowed £16.0 billion in Quarter 2 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion to
   £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to goods
   imports, which fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion (Figure 1).

   Much of the fall in Quarter 2 2019 was due to falling imports of
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), chemicals, and
   machinery and transport equipment, following increased imports into
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019.

   The trade in goods deficit narrowed £16.6 billion to £30.4 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 while the services surplus narrowed £0.6 billion to
   £26.2 billion (Figure 2). Imports of unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold) were a large driver in the narrowing of the trade in
   goods balance in Quarter 2. Excluding unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold), the total trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to
   £4.0 billion, as imports of goods fell more than exports.

4. Excluding unspecified goods, goods imports fell £10.7 billion in Quarter 2
2019 following increases in Quarter 1 2019

   Excluding unspecified goods, exports and imports of goods fell in
   Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019 following increases into Quarter 1 (Jan to
   Mar) 2019 (Figure 3).

   Imports of goods fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, driving the narrowing of the total trade deficit. Excluding
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), imports fell £10.7
   billion to £117.0 billion on the quarter.

   Goods exports fell £1.4 billion to £89.6 billion. Excluding unspecified
   goods (including non-monetary gold), exports fell £3.8 billion to £86.8
   billion.

   Falls in imports in Quarter 2 2019, following the increases in Quarter
   1 2019, are consistent with activity being brought forward ahead of the
   UK’s originally intended departure date from the European Union, but we
   are unable to quantify the effect of this. Similar activity has been
   seen elsewhere in the economy, for further information see GDP first
   quarterly estimate, UK: April to June 2019.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) fell £7.3
   billion in Quarter 2 2019 (Figure 4), due largely to falling imports of
   non-monetary gold from non-EU countries.

   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), EU countries
   drove falling imports in Quarter 2 2019. Chemical imports fell £4.3
   billion in the quarter, £2.5 billion of which was due to falling
   imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from EU countries.
   These falls in imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products
   followed increased imports in Quarter 1 2019.

   Imports of machinery and transport equipment fell £3.8 billion, £2.9
   billion of which was driven by falling imports of road vehicles and
   electrical machinery from EU countries.

   Rises in exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) to
   non-EU countries partially offset falls in exports of machinery and
   transport equipment, and chemicals to EU countries (Figure 5).
   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), exports of
   goods fell £3.8 billion to £86.8 billion in Quarter 2 2019.

   Exports of machinery and transport equipment fell £2.9 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 due largely to exports to the EU falling £2.0 billion.
   Falls in exports in this commodity grouping were broad-based with the
   largest contributors being mechanical machinery and road vehicles.

   Chemical exports fell £1.9 billion in Quarter 2 2019, £1.4 billion of
   which was due to falling exports to EU countries. Exports of medicinal
   and pharmaceutical products to the EU fell £0.8 billion on the quarter.

   Similar to imports, falling exports in Quarter 2 2019 were consistent
   with activity being brought forward in Quarter 1 2019 ahead of the UK’s
   originally intended departure from the European Union. While the
   monthly path for exports increased into March 2019, the increase into
   March and subsequent fall in April 2019 was smaller than that for
   imports.

5. Removing the effect of inflation, the trade deficit narrowed £17.2 billion
in Quarter 2 2019

   This section presents volume and price estimates of UK trade exports,
   imports and balances, using chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied
   deflators (IDEFs). A CVM is a “real” measure in that it has had the
   effect of inflation removed. An IDEF shows the implied change in
   average prices for the respective components of the trade balance, for
   example, the IDEF for imports will show the average price movement for
   imports.

   In volume terms, the total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed
   £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, as the
   trade in goods deficit narrowed £17.7 billion to £29.8 billion and the
   trade in services surplus narrowed £0.5 billion to £25.4 billion
   (Figure 6).

   Goods exports decreased £3.0 billion to £79.5 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, while goods imports fell by a greater £20.7 billion to £109.3
   billion.

   Services exports fell £2.1 billion to £66.9 billion, while services
   imports fell by £1.6 billion to £41.5 billion.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) from non-EU
   countries drove the narrowing of the trade deficit in volume terms in
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, along with falling imports of chemicals,
   and machinery and transport equipment from EU countries.

   The trade deficit narrowed more in volumes than in current prices in
   Quarter 2 2019 as import prices on average grew by more than export
   prices, following falls in both in Quarter 1 2019. Import prices
   increased 2.6% on average on the quarter, compared with 1.2% for export
   prices. Increases in import and export prices were driven largely by
   fuels. The implied deflators for fuels increased 12.7% for exports and
   14.2% for imports on the quarter.

a narrowing of the trade in goods deficit

7. The total trade deficit widened in the 12 months to June 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) widened £19.9 billion to
   £42.8 billion in the 12 months to June 2019, due largely to widening of
   the trade in goods deficit (Figure 7).

   The trade in goods deficit widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion in
   the 12 months to June 2019, as imports of goods increased £29.3 billion
   to £508.1 billion compared with exports, which rose by a lesser £14.9
   billion to £358.9 billion.

   The largest contributor to the increase in exports was fuels, which
   increased £7.1 billion. The increase in imports was driven primarily by
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), machinery and
   transport equipment, and fuels, which rose £9.5 billion, £5.3 billion
   and £4.6 billion respectively.

   The trade in services surplus narrowed £5.5 billion to £106.4 billion
   in the 12 months to June 2019, as imports increased £12.4 billion to
   £181.6 billion, while exports grew by a lesser £6.9 billion to £288.0
   billion. The main contributors to the increase in imports of services
   were other business, financial and travel services.

8. The trade in goods deficit widened with non-EU countries and narrowed with
EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019

   The £14.4 billion widening in the trade in goods deficit in the 12
   months to June 2019 was due mainly to trade with non-EU countries
   (Figure 8). The trade in goods deficit widened £14.9 billion to £55.9
   billion with non-EU countries and narrowed £0.5 billion to £93.4
   billion with EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019.

   The widening of the trade in goods deficit with non-EU countries in the
   12 months to June 2019 was due mainly to imports, which increased £24.5
   billion, while exports increased by a lesser £9.6 billion.

   The largest contributors to the increase in imports from non-EU
   countries were unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), fuels,
   and machinery and transport equipment, which increased £9.7 billion,
   £5.7 billion and £4.1 billion respectively.

   Increased exports to non-EU countries were driven by increases in
   exports of fuels, unspecified goods and miscellaneous manufactures,
   which increased £2.9 billion, £2.1 billion and £2.1 billion
   respectively.

9. Links to related statistics

   On 31 July 2019, we published Modes of supply, UK experimental
   estimates: 2018. This release contains the first exploratory estimates
   of UK trade in services broken down by mode of supply, showing how
   services trade is conducted, in addition to what is traded and with
   whom. The UK is one of the first countries to have developed such
   estimates.

   On 24 July 2019, we published UK trade in services by partner country:
   January to March 2019. Alongside this release we published a dataset
   containing UK total trade, goods and services by partner country up to
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, providing a geographical breakdown of the
   most recent and consistent UK trade estimates.

   On 15 May 2019, we published UK trade in services by industry, country
   and service type, presenting a new experimental dataset for trade in
   services by industry, country and service type on a balance of payments
   basis.

   On 24 April 2019, we published UK trade in goods by industry, country
   and commodity: 2008 to 2017, presenting an updated experimental dataset
   for UK trade in goods by industry, country and commodity on a balance
   of payments basis.

   On 29 January 2019, we published New frontiers in trade analysis, which
   summarises recent developments in UK goods and services statistics and
   examines, using our more granular trade in goods data, recent trends in
   UK trade of road vehicles.

   On 24 October 2018, we published UK trade statistics transformation:
   achievements and forward look, which summarises our transformation of
   UK trade statistics, highlighting the delivery of new detail and
   analysis and the focus of ongoing developments.

   On 24 October 2018, we published Estimating the value of service
   exports abroad from different parts of the UK: 2011 to 2016, which
   provides a breakdown of services exports by functional category from
   the nine English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

   On 24 September 2018, we published Why has the UK trade in goods
   deficit widened in real terms?. The article uses our new country by
   commodity data to look at the UK trade in goods deficit over the past
   20 years and highlights which countries and commodities have been
   behind the growth of the deficit.

   On 6 July 2018, we published UK trade in goods and productivity: new
   findings. This article describes a new dataset we have developed, which
   includes information from both the Annual Business Survey and HM
   Revenue and Customs’ trade in goods administrative data. It shows a
   strong association between trader status and productivity, highlighting
   the prevalence of trading behaviour across different types of business.

   Supplementary quarterly data analysed by product according to the UK
   trade in goods by classification of product by activity (CPA 2008) are
   also available.

10. Quality and methodology

   Trade is measured through both exports and imports of goods and
   services. Data are supplied by over 30 sources including several
   administrative sources, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) being the largest
   for trade in goods.

   This monthly release contains tables showing the total value of trade
   in goods together with chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied
   deflators (IDEFs). Figures are analysed by broad commodity group (CP,
   CVMs and IDEFs) and according to geographical area (CP only). In
   addition, the UK trade statistical bulletin also includes early monthly
   estimates of the value of trade in services.

   Further qualitative data and information can be found in the attached
   datasets. This includes data on:
     * response rates
     * revision triangles

   Detailed methodological notes are published in the UK Balance of
   Payments, The Pink Book 2018.

   The UK trade methodology web pages have been developed to provide
   detailed information about the methods used to produce UK trade
   statistics.

   The UK trade Quality and Methodology Information report contains
   important information on:
     * the strengths and limitations of the data and how it compares with
       related data
     * uses and users of the data
     * how the output was created
     * the quality of the output including the accuracy of the data

1. Main points

     * The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion
       to £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to
       falling imports of goods.
     * Imports of goods decreased £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in
       Quarter 2 2019 as imports of unspecified goods (including
       non-monetary gold), chemicals, and machinery and transport
       equipment fell, following sharp rises in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar)
       2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to £4.0 billion in Quarter 2
       2019, as imports from EU countries fell following sharp rises in
       Quarter 1 2019.
     * Removing the effect of inflation, the total trade deficit narrowed
       £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 2019.
     * Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), the
       total trade balance remained in deficit at £0.6 billion in June
       2019; however, including unspecified goods (including non-monetary
       gold), total trade returned a surplus of £1.8 billion.
     * The total trade deficit widened £19.9 billion to £42.8 billion in
       the 12 months to June 2019, due mainly to the trade in goods
       deficit, which widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion; the
       services surplus narrowed by a lesser £5.5 billion to £106.4
       billion.

2. Things you need to know about this release

Data revision policy

   In accordance with National Accounts Revisions Policy, data in this
   release have been revised back to April 2019 when compared with our
   previous trade bulletin from 10 July 2019. Data in this release are
   consistent with the GDP first quarterly estimate for Quarter 2 (Apr to
   June) 2019 also published on 9 August 2019.

National Statistics designation status

   The UK Statistics Authority suspended the National Statistics
   designation of UK trade (PDF 72.8KB) on 14 November 2014. We have now
   responded to all of the specific requirements of the reassessment of UK
   trade and are in the final stages of providing evidence to the
   Authority.

   We are undertaking a programme of improvements to UK trade statistics
   in line with the UK trade development plan, including more detail and
   improvements now published to address anticipated future demands. On 24
   October 2018, we published an article outlining our achievements so far
   and forward look with regards to the transformation of our trade
   statistics.

   We continue to work with the Office for Statistics Regulation team to
   regain National Statistics status for UK trade statistics. We welcome
   feedback on our new trade statistics, developments and future plans. If
   you have any comments, please send them by email to trade@ons.gov.uk.

UK trade data

   Unless otherwise specified, data within this bulletin are in current
   prices, in other words, they have not been adjusted to remove the
   effects of inflation.

   UK trade data within our monthly trade bulletin are published at around
   a six-week lag because of the timeliness of source data. For example,
   the August 2019 publication will include data up to the end of June
   2019.

Erratic commodities

   Trade statistics for any one month can be erratic. For that reason, we
   recommend comparing the latest three months against the preceding three
   months, and the same three months of the previous year.

   Oil and other “erratic” commodities can make a large contribution to
   trade in goods, but often mask the underlying trend in the export or
   import values due to their volatility. The “erratics” series includes
   ships, aircraft, precious stones, silver and non-monetary gold.
   Non-monetary gold can have a particularly large impact because of the
   large volumes of gold traded on the London markets. Therefore, we also
   publish data exclusive of these commodities, which may provide a better
   guide to the emerging trade picture.

Non-monetary gold

   In line with international standards, the Office for National
   Statistics’ (ONS’s) headline trade statistics contain the UK’s exports
   and imports of non-monetary gold. Non-monetary gold is the technical
   term for gold bullion not owned by central banks.

   Because a significant amount of the world’s trade in non-monetary gold
   takes place on the London markets, this trade can have a large impact
   on the size of and change in the UK’s headline trade figures.

   Non-monetary gold is one subcomponent of the commodity group
   “unspecified goods”.

   More information about the ONS’s recording of non-monetary gold is
   available.

Trade asymmetries

   These data are our best estimates of bilateral UK trade flows, compiled
   following internationally agreed standards and using a wide range of
   robust data sources. However, in some cases alternative estimates of
   bilateral trade flows are available from the statistical agencies for
   those countries or through central databases such as UN Comtrade.
   Differences between estimates are known as trade asymmetries and are a
   known aspect of international trade statistics, affecting bilateral
   estimates across the globe, not just the UK.

   We are heavily engaged in analysis of these asymmetries, developing
   strong bilateral relationships with other countries to understand,
   explain and potentially reduce them. We have published a series of
   analyses showing comparisons and the relative strengths of different
   estimates, which users may wish to reference to help them better
   understand the quality of our bilateral trade estimates.

Blue Book 2019

   Each year we produce an annual update to the UK National Accounts in
   the Blue Book and Pink Book and the associated releases. As already
   announced, the Blue Book and Pink Book 2019 consistent datasets will be
   published on 30 September 2019.

   Details have already been provided on the scope in the article Latest
   developments and changes to be implemented in Blue Book and Pink Book
   2019. Indicative impacts on headline gross domestic product (GDP)
   components for the years 1997 to 2016 were published on 27 June 2019 in
   the article Blue Book 2019 indicative impacts on GDP current price and
   chained volume measure estimates: 1997 to 2016.

   This year, due to the very demanding set of changes being put through
   in the annual update, we are not going to fully reconcile 2017 annual
   data, instead producing an indicative balance to allow further time for
   final quality assurance of the data.

   Consequently, the reference year and last base year for all chained
   volume measure series will remain as 2016.

3. Total trade deficit narrowed £16.0 billion in Quarter 2 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed £16.0 billion to
   £4.3 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, due largely to goods
   imports, which fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion (Figure 1).

   Much of the fall in Quarter 2 2019 was due to falling imports of
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), chemicals, and
   machinery and transport equipment, following increased imports into
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019.

   The trade in goods deficit narrowed £16.6 billion to £30.4 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 while the services surplus narrowed £0.6 billion to
   £26.2 billion (Figure 2). Imports of unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold) were a large driver in the narrowing of the trade in
   goods balance in Quarter 2. Excluding unspecified goods (including
   non-monetary gold), the total trade deficit narrowed £6.2 billion to
   £4.0 billion, as imports of goods fell more than exports.

4. Excluding unspecified goods, goods imports fell £10.7 billion in Quarter 2
2019 following increases in Quarter 1 2019

   Excluding unspecified goods, exports and imports of goods fell in
   Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019 following increases into Quarter 1 (Jan to
   Mar) 2019 (Figure 3).

   Imports of goods fell £18.0 billion to £120.0 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, driving the narrowing of the total trade deficit. Excluding
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), imports fell £10.7
   billion to £117.0 billion on the quarter.

   Goods exports fell £1.4 billion to £89.6 billion. Excluding unspecified
   goods (including non-monetary gold), exports fell £3.8 billion to £86.8
   billion.

   Falls in imports in Quarter 2 2019, following the increases in Quarter
   1 2019, are consistent with activity being brought forward ahead of the
   UK’s originally intended departure date from the European Union, but we
   are unable to quantify the effect of this. Similar activity has been
   seen elsewhere in the economy, for further information see GDP first
   quarterly estimate, UK: April to June 2019.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) fell £7.3
   billion in Quarter 2 2019 (Figure 4), due largely to falling imports of
   non-monetary gold from non-EU countries.

   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), EU countries
   drove falling imports in Quarter 2 2019. Chemical imports fell £4.3
   billion in the quarter, £2.5 billion of which was due to falling
   imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from EU countries.
   These falls in imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products
   followed increased imports in Quarter 1 2019.

   Imports of machinery and transport equipment fell £3.8 billion, £2.9
   billion of which was driven by falling imports of road vehicles and
   electrical machinery from EU countries.

   Rises in exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) to
   non-EU countries partially offset falls in exports of machinery and
   transport equipment, and chemicals to EU countries (Figure 5).
   Excluding unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), exports of
   goods fell £3.8 billion to £86.8 billion in Quarter 2 2019.

   Exports of machinery and transport equipment fell £2.9 billion in
   Quarter 2 2019 due largely to exports to the EU falling £2.0 billion.
   Falls in exports in this commodity grouping were broad-based with the
   largest contributors being mechanical machinery and road vehicles.

   Chemical exports fell £1.9 billion in Quarter 2 2019, £1.4 billion of
   which was due to falling exports to EU countries. Exports of medicinal
   and pharmaceutical products to the EU fell £0.8 billion on the quarter.

   Similar to imports, falling exports in Quarter 2 2019 were consistent
   with activity being brought forward in Quarter 1 2019 ahead of the UK’s
   originally intended departure from the European Union. While the
   monthly path for exports increased into March 2019, the increase into
   March and subsequent fall in April 2019 was smaller than that for
   imports.

5. Removing the effect of inflation, the trade deficit narrowed £17.2 billion
in Quarter 2 2019

   This section presents volume and price estimates of UK trade exports,
   imports and balances, using chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied
   deflators (IDEFs). A CVM is a “real” measure in that it has had the
   effect of inflation removed. An IDEF shows the implied change in
   average prices for the respective components of the trade balance, for
   example, the IDEF for imports will show the average price movement for
   imports.

   In volume terms, the total trade deficit (goods and services) narrowed
   £17.2 billion to £4.4 billion in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2019, as the
   trade in goods deficit narrowed £17.7 billion to £29.8 billion and the
   trade in services surplus narrowed £0.5 billion to £25.4 billion
   (Figure 6).

   Goods exports decreased £3.0 billion to £79.5 billion in Quarter 2
   2019, while goods imports fell by a greater £20.7 billion to £109.3
   billion.

   Services exports fell £2.1 billion to £66.9 billion, while services
   imports fell by £1.6 billion to £41.5 billion.

   Imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) from non-EU
   countries drove the narrowing of the trade deficit in volume terms in
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, along with falling imports of chemicals,
   and machinery and transport equipment from EU countries.

   The trade deficit narrowed more in volumes than in current prices in
   Quarter 2 2019 as import prices on average grew by more than export
   prices, following falls in both in Quarter 1 2019. Import prices
   increased 2.6% on average on the quarter, compared with 1.2% for export
   prices. Increases in import and export prices were driven largely by
   fuels. The implied deflators for fuels increased 12.7% for exports and
   14.2% for imports on the quarter.

a narrowing of the trade in goods deficit

7. The total trade deficit widened in the 12 months to June 2019

   The total trade deficit (goods and services) widened £19.9 billion to
   £42.8 billion in the 12 months to June 2019, due largely to widening of
   the trade in goods deficit (Figure 7).

   The trade in goods deficit widened £14.4 billion to £149.2 billion in
   the 12 months to June 2019, as imports of goods increased £29.3 billion
   to £508.1 billion compared with exports, which rose by a lesser £14.9
   billion to £358.9 billion.

   The largest contributor to the increase in exports was fuels, which
   increased £7.1 billion. The increase in imports was driven primarily by
   unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), machinery and
   transport equipment, and fuels, which rose £9.5 billion, £5.3 billion
   and £4.6 billion respectively.

   The trade in services surplus narrowed £5.5 billion to £106.4 billion
   in the 12 months to June 2019, as imports increased £12.4 billion to
   £181.6 billion, while exports grew by a lesser £6.9 billion to £288.0
   billion. The main contributors to the increase in imports of services
   were other business, financial and travel services.

8. The trade in goods deficit widened with non-EU countries and narrowed with
EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019

   The £14.4 billion widening in the trade in goods deficit in the 12
   months to June 2019 was due mainly to trade with non-EU countries
   (Figure 8). The trade in goods deficit widened £14.9 billion to £55.9
   billion with non-EU countries and narrowed £0.5 billion to £93.4
   billion with EU countries in the 12 months to June 2019.

   The widening of the trade in goods deficit with non-EU countries in the
   12 months to June 2019 was due mainly to imports, which increased £24.5
   billion, while exports increased by a lesser £9.6 billion.

   The largest contributors to the increase in imports from non-EU
   countries were unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold), fuels,
   and machinery and transport equipment, which increased £9.7 billion,
   £5.7 billion and £4.1 billion respectively.

   Increased exports to non-EU countries were driven by increases in
   exports of fuels, unspecified goods and miscellaneous manufactures,
   which increased £2.9 billion, £2.1 billion and £2.1 billion
   respectively.

9. Links to related statistics

   On 31 July 2019, we published Modes of supply, UK experimental
   estimates: 2018. This release contains the first exploratory estimates
   of UK trade in services broken down by mode of supply, showing how
   services trade is conducted, in addition to what is traded and with
   whom. The UK is one of the first countries to have developed such
   estimates.

   On 24 July 2019, we published UK trade in services by partner country:
   January to March 2019. Alongside this release we published a dataset
   containing UK total trade, goods and services by partner country up to
   Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019, providing a geographical breakdown of the
   most recent and consistent UK trade estimates.

   On 15 May 2019, we published UK trade in services by industry, country
   and service type, presenting a new experimental dataset for trade in
   services by industry, country and service type on a balance of payments
   basis.

   On 24 April 2019, we published UK trade in goods by industry, country
   and commodity: 2008 to 2017, presenting an updated experimental dataset
   for UK trade in goods by industry, country and commodity on a balance
   of payments basis.

   On 29 January 2019, we published New frontiers in trade analysis, which
   summarises recent developments in UK goods and services statistics and
   examines, using our more granular trade in goods data, recent trends in
   UK trade of road vehicles.

   On 24 October 2018, we published UK trade statistics transformation:
   achievements and forward look, which summarises our transformation of
   UK trade statistics, highlighting the delivery of new detail and
   analysis and the focus of ongoing developments.

   On 24 October 2018, we published Estimating the value of service
   exports abroad from different parts of the UK: 2011 to 2016, which
   provides a breakdown of services exports by functional category from
   the nine English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

   On 24 September 2018, we published Why has the UK trade in goods
   deficit widened in real terms?. The article uses our new country by
   commodity data to look at the UK trade in goods deficit over the past
   20 years and highlights which countries and commodities have been
   behind the growth of the deficit.

   On 6 July 2018, we published UK trade in goods and productivity: new
   findings. This article describes a new dataset we have developed, which
   includes information from both the Annual Business Survey and HM
   Revenue and Customs’ trade in goods administrative data. It shows a
   strong association between trader status and productivity, highlighting
   the prevalence of trading behaviour across different types of business.

   Supplementary quarterly data analysed by product according to the UK
   trade in goods by classification of product by activity (CPA 2008) are
   also available.

10. Quality and methodology

   Trade is measured through both exports and imports of goods and
   services. Data are supplied by over 30 sources including several
   administrative sources, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) being the largest
   for trade in goods.

   This monthly release contains tables showing the total value of trade
   in goods together with chained volume measures (CVMs) and implied
   deflators (IDEFs). Figures are analysed by broad commodity group (CP,
   CVMs and IDEFs) and according to geographical area (CP only). In
   addition, the UK trade statistical bulletin also includes early monthly
   estimates of the value of trade in services.

   Further qualitative data and information can be found in the attached
   datasets. This includes data on:
     * response rates
     * revision triangles

   Detailed methodological notes are published in the UK Balance of
   Payments, The Pink Book 2018.

   The UK trade methodology web pages have been developed to provide
   detailed information about the methods used to produce UK trade
   statistics.

   The UK trade Quality and Methodology Information report contains
   important information on:
     * the strengths and limitations of the data and how it compares with
       related data
     * uses and users of the data
     * how the output was created
     * the quality of the output including the accuracy of the data
