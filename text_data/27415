   Instagram post 2145476009437138420_2052076172 Friday we made apple
   trees for a fun STEM challenge! When they came in I had a cardboard
   tube at each chair and two trays with green popsicle sticks that were
   various sizes, pattern block triangles, and apple mini erasers (from
   last months @kindergartencrate )! Each student built their tree using
   different strategies which I love! Then they drew a picture of true
   apple tree üçéüçèüçé. I also took a photo of their apple tree which I will
   glue to the bottom of their page. The STEM Sketch page is in each one
   of my STEMI Can Build Units.. . . . . . #Teachersofinstagram
