OUR STORY

   In 2008 Tim and I went through the most amazing and difficult year we’d
   encountered in 9 years of marriage. We welcomed the birth of our oldest
   son and Tim found himself out of work. I remember sitting there with my
   newborn baby sobbing and wondering how we were going to make it. True…
   my hormones were all over but it was more than that. I just didn’t know
   what to do and that feeling of helplessness surrounded me.

TESTIMONIALS

   We had Clair speak at our Mom2Mom group about Meal Planning. I
   absolutely loved her! She was very funny and informative. Lot of
   practical advice that i was able to easily implement in my meal
   planning. Looking forward to having her again.
   Kim Blohm

   In the three years of being in MOPS, Clair provided the most useful
   information and was the best speaker to date! Clair not only taught me
   how to find amazing deals in stores, but she cracked me up along the
   way! Great information, great advice, and a stunning speaker.
