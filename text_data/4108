   Third-Party Users
   Read More

   You are a Third-Party User when you visit a page of a website or
   application of one of our Sportradar ad:s partners where Sportradar’s
   or our technology partners’ tags, pixels, other similar technology or
   content products (widgets) (“Sportradar Technology“) are installed
   (“Partner Sites“). The Partner Sites belong to online publishers and
   partners who want to recommend relevant content to their readers or
   advertisers who want readers to view their content.

   For example, our Sportradar Technology is implemented on LAOLA1.at. If
   you click on LAOLA1.at‘s privacy and cookie notices, you will see
   detailed information that enables you to read this Privacy Notice and
   our Cookie Notice.

   If you would like to know more about the Sportradar ad:s solution,
   please click here: https://www.sportradar.com/ads/.

   a. What personal data we collect and Why

   We use online identifiers such as UUIDs, IP address and other usage
   information so that we can serve interesting content products and
   recommendations. Sportradar processes your personal data to provide you
   with the most relevant ads based on your interests. These ads will link
   a publisher’s website/app to an advertiser’s website/app.

   •  Unique User Identifier (UUID)

   When as a Third-Party User you first visit a Partner Site (e.g.
   LAOLA1.at), Sportradar drops a cookie on your device in order to
   generate an UUID. We catalog and analyze the content you consume across
   Partner Sites. Our recommendations are based on: (i) your browsing
   history; (ii) similar browsing patterns of other Third-Party Users;
   (iii) recommendations that are generally popular with Sportradar’s
   audience at this time; and (iv) targeting requirements that may be
   provided or requested by advertisers. As an example, Sportradar may
   know that UUID 123 (which could be you on your mobile device on
   LAOLA1.at using Safari as your browser) likes to read sports news about
   Darts and that people who like to read about Darts will most probably
   also be interested in sports news about Beach Volleyball.

   The UUID is a sequence of numbers and/or letters. This UUID attaches
   itself to your device and varies depending on which browser you use. In
   other words, Sportradar records a different UUID depending on which
   device and/or which browser you use when accessing the Partner Sites.
   For example, this means that you will have one UUID when you visit a
   Partner Site from your mobile phone using the browser Safari, and a
   different UUID when you visit a Partner Site from your iPad using the
   browser Safari. Sportradar will combine and consolidate a UUID from a
   mobile device (phone or tablet) from a browser that then accesses an
   application (or vice versa) from that same device.

   Assigning an UUID allows Sportradar to associate the page views and
   clicks on Sportradar’s delivered ads from such UUID – all with the goal
   of providing interesting recommendations.

   Apart from UUID, we also collect the following information from you:

   • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device you are using
   • cookie ID and other online user identifier(s)
   • your device type (e.g. iPhone), your browser type (e.g. Chrome), your
   operating system (e.g. iOS), your screen resolution
   • the language your browser is set to and/or used for our interactive
   features and respective contents on our Partner Sites
   • the date and time of access of our Partner Sites
   • your mouse movements, clicks and location
   • referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP
   requests (e.g. this information tells us where you arrived on our
   Partner Sites from)
   • location data (country and region)
   • information on how you use our Partner Sites (e.g. the web pages
   visited by you on our Partner Sites) and how you interact with our
   interactive features and respective contents on our Partner Sites.

   The above information provides us with insights about how many
   Third-Party Users have visited a specific page on our Partner Sites on
   which the Sportradar Technology is present, how long each User stayed
   on that page, the type of content on that page they clicked on and how
   they generally engaged with that page. This information is only
   personal data when it is associated with a UUID.

   b. What cookies and other similar technologies we use

   Please see our Cookie Notice under “Third-Party Users” for a detailed
   list of cookies we use when you interact with Partner Sites where the
   Sportradar Technology is implemented.

   If, for example, you load a webpage containing recommendations, the
   advertisers sponsoring the recommendations may place cookies on your
   device through redirects prior to arriving on the destination page of
   the recommendations or upon reaching the destination page. In such
   cases you will be subject to the advertisers’ privacy policies.

   Sportradar advertisers implement the Sportradar pixel on their
   websites. Sportradar determines whether the user reaching the page
   where the pixel is installed has a Sportradar UUID. Sportradar further
   implements cookie sync with advertisers in order to be able to run
   retargeting advertising campaigns.

   Data points such as page views and clicks that are connected to a
   particular UUID are retained for 18 months. For example, if UUID 123
   views a particular webpage on 31 December, 2017, on 1 September 2019
   that information (i.e. the webpage view event) will no longer be part
   of UUID 123’s profile.

   c. How we may share information

   Sportradar does not share user segments with any third parties.
   However, we may share the UUID and other usage information with certain
   partners for the purpose of cookie syncing, or based on technical
   requirements.

   For more information, please see also Section 9 (How We Share Your
   Personal Data) of this Privacy Notice.

   d. Your rights

   For more information, please see also Section 11 (What Data Protection
   Rights You Have) of this Privacy Notice.

   e. Lawful Basis for Processing

   Sportradar’s lawful basis for processing a Third-Party User’s personal
   data is based on the lawful basis determined by each of our Partner
   Sites. Each Partner Site will rely on consent or legitimate interest.
   Please consult the applicable Partner Sites’ privacy policies for more
   information about their lawful basis. If a Partner is relying on
   consent, Sportradar will not drop a cookie on you if you have not
   provided consent on such Partner Site.

   information to sports federations, betting operators and media

   detection and prevention services and sports-related profiling and
   statistics.

   Personal Data) of this Privacy Notice.

   d. Lawful Basis for Processing

   professionals’ personal data is based on the lawful basis determined by
   our partners. Each partner will rely on consent, legitimate interest or
   public interest. Please consult the applicable partner’s privacy policy
   for more information about their lawful basis.

   personal data the same protection it has in the EU/EEA;
   • where we partner with companies in the United States, we may transfer
   Personal Data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield scheme,
