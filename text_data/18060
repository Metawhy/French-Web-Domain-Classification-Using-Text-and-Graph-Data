   We make web & mobile apps.

   We are a small team of software engineers crafting innovative web &
   mobile applications since 2005.

What do we do?

   We create websites, web applications, mobile web applications and
   native mobile applications. We can do it remotely in our office in
   Strasbourg, France, or we can do it on site, in your office.

   For 9 years, we've been helping startups, web entrepreneurs, SMEs and
   communities by developing software for them and with them.

   Our speciality is to quickly transform your ideas or your
   specifications into a live web or mobile application, and iterate from
   this point, so you can maximise the ratio of money spent against
   informations learnt from your users or customers.

Why work with us?

   We now have a long track record of successul projects.

   It isn’t just about developing software! Lots of people can write great
   code; Novelys offers more. When it comes to bridging the gap between an
   idea and a working project, we really know who to listen to - you!

   We are experts in our domains, and recognized as such. We’re committed
   to technology. It’s a long term relationship and we’re smitten. It’s
   not about throwing every slice of new tech at a project. There’s a
   delicate balance between beneficial new technology and stable,
   old-faithful components. Each project is different.

   We are passionate about the web. We love its plasticity, its constant
   organic evolution. We are always up-to-date, constantly watching new
   stuff, experimenting, separating the wheat from the chaff.

   We're Agile. Our quality process includes different agile methologies
   such as XP, Scrum or Kanban. Transparency is at the core of our company
   culture: we share our culture, our tools, our knowledge and our passion
   with our customers.

   We work a lot with startups. That means that we have the competences
   and mindset to live in the startup world. And we can bring this spirit
   into your company.

What are the technologies we use?

   We use rapid prototyping technologies to quickly transform your ideas
   into a live application. Technologies such as Ruby, Rails, Go, Amazon
   Web Services, Heroku, MongoDB or Redis, Javascript (with Backbone.js,
   EmberJS, AngularJS or NodeJS) are part of our standard toolbox. We then
   maintain these applications through the time. We work with some
   customers for years now!
