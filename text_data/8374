   The Warlocks Los Angeles, California

   placeholder

   The Warlocks started because of the their mutual love of all things
   Rock and Roll. We love a lot of the 60s, 70s and some 80s inspired
   music. We are not a retro band though. We all always try new stuff and
   from time to time hit something great.

   The Warlocks started because of the their mutual love of all things
   Rock and Roll. We love a lot of the 60s, 70s and some 80s inspired
   music. We are not a retro band though. We all always try new stuff and
   from time to time hit something great.

       Holy smoke. One of the finest contemporary psych albums I've heard.
       Like an acoustic Annexus Quam meets Popul Vuh circa Brüder des
       Schattens meets Amon Düül circa Paradieswärts Düül meets
       traditional musicians from rural Iran playing Fairport Convention's
       Matty Groves. Forward thinking heads from southern Arizona making
       music as authentic and transcendent as it comes. Mushroom Head
