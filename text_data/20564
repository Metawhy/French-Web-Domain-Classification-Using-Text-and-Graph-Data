     * Jimmy W., Fort Lauderdale, Florida Owner We are so happy with
       ScaperSoft! We process all of our invoices and manage customer
       balances and payments with this software. Recently we discovered
       the "Mailing" feature and it seriously saves so much time and our
       customers are happy with the return envelope and perforated
       invoices. Its like having our own secretary doing this for us while
       we are working in the field. Instead of the hassle of printing -
       printer ink, paper, envelopes, and stamps it is all professionally
       done by ScaperSoft, amazing! Along with "Email" invoice and PayPal
       features it is a complete package. Customer service is the best!
     * Mike C., Kansas Before using this software, my billing and expenses
       were a chore, but now everything is so seamless. I am able to track
       billing and expenses in great detail, and by customer if needed. At
       the end of each month I can send out all my invoices in a matter of
       minutes, in what used to take me hours. Another nice feature is the
       ability to schedule jobs using the calendar feature.
     * Kyle J., Springfield, Missouri I would like to say that we are very
       pleased with ScaperSoft's services with our business. The calendar
       and scheduling features make it easy to stay on top of your
       activities. We really like having the ability to create invoices
       and even having ScaperSoft mail them out to our customers for us.
       The friendly and helpful customer assistance group have always
       responded promptly with any question that we have had.
     * Robert T., Salt Lake City, Utah This is the best landscaping
       business software. My billing and expenses were a chore, but now
       everything is so seamless. I am able to track billing and expenses
       in great detail, and by customer if needed. At the end of each
       month I can send out all my invoices in a matter of minutes, in
       what used to take me hours. Another nice feature is the ability to
