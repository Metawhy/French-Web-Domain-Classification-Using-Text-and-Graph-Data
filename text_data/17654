Me, Myself and My Blog. Oh Sister, Where Art Thou...?

   [beach%2Bhair.jpg]
   where art thou, indeed. if i think about that too much i'll be infused
   with more self-inflicted guilt than i already have over the fact that i
   haven't posted anything since last may. stupid. feeling guilty about my
   lack of blogging presence. but...there it is. a little inside about me.
   moving on.
   hello, christmas right around the corner!!! can you believe it?!? we
   just put up halloween decorations and my kids are still trying to
   decide what they want to dress up as but, yesterday, i watched a
   christmas movie on netflix. can't help it - love 'em! i have a friend
   who's probably already done with her christmas shopping (you know who
   you are, lady) and diy's are already popping up all over pinterest.
   i've been in somewhat of a funk the last several months and so haven't
   been as productive as i would have liked. still, not a total loss
   creatively speaking. i did manage to play around here and there...

   [chevron%2Bbaby%2Bblanket.jpg]
   [strawberry%2Bpie.jpg]
   now i'm in the process of making clay oil lamps which i chose as the
   take-away favor for our church's women's christmas dinner, coming up
   with new fragrances for the skin-care products that i sell in my etsy
   shop - honey grapefruit...yum! - figuring out what will be my homemade
   gift to my kids this year, and wondering if i'll have enough [DEL:
   juice :DEL] time to make all of the things i want to make between now
   and thanksgiving. an occasional coffee or lunch date with friend so
   that i don't isolate (easy for me to do), dealing with menopause (which
   completely SUCKS!), knowing that the 13th anniversary of my first
   husband passing away is next month which always makes me somewhat wonky
   starting about now and which feels doubly so this time because i'm in
   the same time frame in this marriage as i was in my first in which he
   died - 10 years. not an easy place to be and i can see that i'm making
   myself extra busy right now instead of sitting in it. i've tried to
   work on this and it isn't always easy. thankfully, there's grace. from
   my friends who know me, from my husband who loves me, and from God who
   knew this was all coming down the line.
   baby steps.

Flourless Carrot Cake with Goat Cream Cheese Frosting and A First Apartment

   [pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png]
   [cc+7.jpg]
   one of my closest friends just got her first apartment. this is huge.
   the kind of huge that's scary and exhilarating in the same breath. and
   it's not like she did this right from leaving home or just graduating
   from college like so many. she's done it for the first time since
   leaving home, getting married, having children, dealing with loss,
   going through a divorce, moving back home... huge, right? brave. making
   every decision on her own and not having to check with anyone about
   paint colors or furniture placement or which way the toilet paper
   should come off the roll. freaking out about bills. eating cereal for
   dinner at 10 o'clock.
   this is huge-ness that deserves an equally huge dessert and when i came
   across this recipe, i knew it would be perfect to bring to her house
   last night when several of her friends and i got together to help
   unpack and set up her kitchen. she doesn't eat gluten or dairy though
   is able to tolerate goat milk products (hence the replacements for the
   frosting).
   [cc+1.jpg]
   Gluten Free Carrot Cake with Goat Cream Cheese Frosting
   adapted from a Donna Hay Recipe
   the what...
     * 5 eggs, at room temperature
     * 1½ cups brown sugar (not packed)
     * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
     * ½ cup vegetable oil
     * 3½ cups almond meal
     * 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
     * 1 teaspoon ground ginger
     * ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
     * 1 teaspoon baking powder
     * 1 teaspoon salt
     * 1 - one pound bag of carrots, peeled and grated
     * ½ cup minced fresh pineapple
     * 1 cup shredded sweetened coconut
     * 1 cup walnut pieces, toasted
     * ½ cup currants

   goat cream cheese icing
     * 6.25 ounces cream cheese, softened
     * 5 ounces goat butter (meyenberg from whole foods)
     * 1 cup powdered (confectioner's/icing) sugar
     * 1 tablespoon lemon juice
     * ½ teaspoon vanilla
     * note: my changes to the original recipe don't yield an icing that
       holds it's shape well. rather, this icing is like an extra thick
       cream.

   [cc+5.jpg]
   the how...
   preheat oven to 325°F. line the base of a lightly greased 9-inch
   spring-form pan with parchment paper and set aside.place the eggs,
   sugar and vanilla in an electric mixer and whisk for 15 minutes or
   until thick and tripled in volume. put the oil, almond meal, cinnamon,
   ginger, nutmeg, baking powder, salt, carrots, coconut, walnuts and
   currants in a large bowl and mix well to combine. fold through the egg
   mixture and spoon into the pan. bake for 1 hour 20 minutes – 1 hour 25
   minutes or until a tooth pick comes out with a few crumbs attached.
   cool completely in the pan before refrigerating for 2–3 hours or until
   firm. to make the cream cheese icing, place all ingredients in an
   electric mixer and beat for 5 minutes or until smooth. chill for 1 hour
   (it's a good idea to make the icing the night before you're planning on
   serving the cake). to serve, run a small knife around the edge of the
   cake and remove from the pan. spread with the icing. serves 8–10.

   [cc+6.jpg]
   look that color! so pretty! and it was moist and dense and tasted just
   like a traditional carrot cake though i like to think that this one is
   on the healthier side.
   [cc+9.jpg]
   the best part? seeing the happy gleam in my friend's eyes when she took
   that first bite. loved it! and if you haven't yet tried your hand at
   gluten free (flourless) baking, i think this would have you sold. you
   could even turn the batter into muffins or small quick breads.
   your gluten free friends will love you!

Triple Layer Chocolate Raspberry Rose Cake with Sweetened Cream

   [pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png]
   [chocolate+cake+5.jpg]
   sometimes, you just have to splurge. a new baby, a promotion, first
   apartment...you know, something BIG! for me, it was my niece's 13th
   birthday which was a big deal because, 1) hello! it's 13 and 2) this
   was the first time she was at my house since i'd met my brother for the
   first time last summer. BIG! HUGE! also, it was mother's day so i
   wanted to make something special to honor all of the mom's who happened
   to be celebrating with us. enter this (not so) little lovely cake.
   i had two inspirations going in. first, the look of this beauty from
   twig studios and the taste of this chocolate cake from my baking
   addiction, both of which i found on pinterest.

                           [victoria+sponge.jpg]

                          [best+chocolate+cake.jpg]
                            the best chocolate cake

   can you imagine the marriage? it's quite perfect, actually. and when
   they say "the best chocolate cake", they mean it! i've made this recipe
   twice now and it's divine. the recipe uses simple ingredients and is
   really straight forward. for this cake, i doubled it and used three
   8-inch cake pans (be sure to butter and flour your pans and line the
   bottoms with buttered parchment).
   [chocolate+cake+1.jpg]
   [chocolate+cake+2.jpg]
   [chocolate+cake+3.jpg]
   3 cups of heavy cream whipped to a gorgeous cloud, sweetened with 1 cup
   of powdered sugar and flavored with a teaspoon of almond extract
   (vanilla is fine or none at all). actually, i would have loved to add
   some rose water to the cream too. yum! then just start layering: cake,
   raspberry jam, cream, fresh raspberries. rinse. repeat.
   [chocolate+cake+4.png]
   don't get caught up in having it look perfect. let the jam and the
   cream ooze and drip from between the layers. i did insert five wooden
   skewers to keep it stable and kept it in the fridge until about 15
   minutes before we were ready to eat it. sooooo good! be sure to add
   candied rose petals to the top to make it extra special.
   [chocolate+cake+6.jpg]
   i know it might look complicated or like a lot of work but it really
   isn't. and who wouldn't love this cake? not only was it delicious, it
   was total eye candy as well! and if chocolate isn't your thing, you
   could make any cake flavor and still stack it up this way. lemon cake
   and blackberries with blackberry jam, vanilla cake with orange
   marmalade and mandarin oranges. get crazy and get baking!

Big Sequin Love Sign

   [love+sign+4.jpg]
   this coming friday, i'll be rockin' my 3rd annual valentine's day party
   and preparations have been in motion for the past couple of months;
   mainly....which appetizers and treats i'll serve, color scheme (pink
   and gold), and stocking up on bottles of pink champagne and dry rose
   wine. i've been pinning ideas to my "be mine" board for the past year
   and which made planning pretty smooth.

                           [brownie+trifle.jpg]
                        brownie and raspberry trifle

                               homemade mints

                              [get+in+here.jpg]
                                "get in here"

                           [gumball+necklace.jpg]
                              gumball necklace

                               [kiss+art.jpg]
                             d.i.y. kiss artwork

                         [raspberry+cream+puffs.jpg]
                          gold raspberry cream puffs

   the lipstick picture was super fun to do and you should try it, if only
   for the conversational aspect of it. since i already had everything on
   hand, this was cost me zero dollars (always a plus, right?!?). i've got
   my gold luster dust all ready for the little raspberry cream puffs and
   i'm going to use strawberries for the brownie trifles. i found pink and
   shimmery gold gumballs on line here for the necklaces (how cute are
   they?). going to spray paint a wood pallet that i have in gold and then
   paint on a big pink heart and write "get in here" in gold and my mom is
   making the mints. fun!!!
   but this big sequin love sign? hello!!! i have it already made and
   displayed and it's SO cute! found the idea on pinterest from these
   clever ladies at popcosmo and new it would be perfect for my party
   especially since it was GOLD!!!
   really, you could do this with any letters you'd like and it would look
   great. click on the link for the deets which are crazy simple.  a
   couple things, though:
     * i used gold acrylic paint instead of spray paint
     * ordered my sequins from hobby lobby but was unsure as to how many
       packages to get (instructions didn't say how many they used). they
       were packaged by weight, not pieces. turns out there are 51 sequins
       in a package. i'd ordered 9 and used 4 with some left over.
     * i pushed the thumbtacks in with my thumb (huh?) just so they'd hold
       then, in the memorable words from the movie, signs, just use a
       hammer and "swing away" to secure them. f.y.i....the pad of my
       thumb is still numb and it's been 2 days.

   [love+sign+1.jpg]
   [love+sign+2.jpg]
   [love+sign+3.jpg]
   this sign has me so excited for my party! i'm really looking forward to
   having friends and family over to love on and celebrate the day with.
   now, if i could just figure out what i'm going to wear....
