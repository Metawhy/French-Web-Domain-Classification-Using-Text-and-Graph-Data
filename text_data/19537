   Garden Gate Fáilte
   Welcome to Irish Culture and Customs, a labor of love we began several
   years ago. What started as a surprise milestone birthday trip to
   Ireland became the beginning of a journey through time. A 2,000-year
   voyage on a quest to learn as much as we can about everything Irish. So
   here's where we are so far - more than 700 pages that range from Irish
   poetry, superstitions , Kids Stories and recipes to specific Irish
   calendar celebrations such as St. Patrick's Day , Beltane, Samhain and
   the Feast of St. Brigid. Whether it's an Irish symbol such as the
   shillelagh, the Shamrock and the Book of Kells or an Irish craft like
   Aran Isle knitting, you'll discover a wide range of topics in our
   index. We hope you find the little bit of Ireland you may be looking
   for and we encourage you to share what you discover with your loved
   ones on your family website, blog, or social network.

   The Clarenbridge Oyster Festival
   by Bridget Haggerty
   Co. Galway is very fortunate to have the best oyster beds in Ireland.
   In the unpolluted waters of Brady Bay and Clarenbridge, the oysters lie
   waiting to be harvested at the beginning of the oyster season on
   September 1st.
   This aristocrat of the sea is generally about three years old, and has
   been maturing and fattening - ready for its first - and last -
   encounter with the locals and tourists. Paired up with homemade brown
   bread and washed down with pints of Guinness, Galway oysters are a
   gourmet treat not to be missed - especially during the annual festivals
   in Clarenbridge and Galway City.

   The Galway International Oyster Festival - a joyous celebration of a
   native aristocrat
   by Bridget Haggerty

   Co. Galway has the best oyster beds in Ireland. In the unpolluted
   waters of Brady Bay and Clarenbridge, the oysters lie waiting to be
   harvested at the beginning of the oyster season on September 1st.
   The first Clarenbridge Oyster Festival took place in September, 1954.
   In an extract from his diary, the late Paddy Burke, proprietor of the
   famous restaurant and bar.

   The Ould Lammas Fair
   by Bridget Haggerty
   The Ould Lammas Fair takes place in Ballycastle, Co. Antrim on the last
   Monday and Tuesday in August. It's one of the oldest fairs in Ireland
   and has been held without interruption for more than three centuries.
   It once took place at Dunanyie Head, now known as Castle Point. Some
   say that it started out as a sheep market, others that it originated
   when Sorley Boy MacDonnell ordered a celebration for his nephew. Either
   way it grew and migrated to Ballycastle. Whether or not today's event
   is because Sorley Boy ordered it up, Lammastide celebrations have a
   long history in Ireland.

   Saint of 9/11: Fr. Mychal
   A Compilation of Tributes & Memories
   by Bridget Haggerty
   He was administering the Last Rites to a fallen firefighter when he
   himself, was struck down. There was no priest available to give Fr.
   Mychal Judge the final sacrament of his faith. It was up to one of his
   own, a NYC firefighter, to give him a traditional Roman Catholic
   spiritual farewell.
   Even before 9/11, many people considered Fr. Mychal a hero: the
   firefighters for whom he served as chaplain, the homeless to whom he
   gave winter coats, people with AIDS to whom he ministered. But after
   9/11, his hero status became official, when Fr. Mychal became the first
   official recorded victim of the attacks on America that day. Also,
   according to all accounts of his life, he possessed that rare
   combination of qualities that are usually attributed to saints:
   nobility and humility.

   An Irish Halloween - Part 1
   by Bridget Haggerty
   Ever since the time of the Druids, many customs and traditions have
   evolved in celebration of Samhain, which is New Years Day in the
   Celtic Calendar. When Christianity came to Ireland, the church took a
   dim view of Druidic festivals and created the vigil of All Souls
   Evening, (or All Hallows Eve) on October 31st, the Feast of All Saints
   on November 1st, and All Souls Day on November 2nd.

   An Irish Hallowe'en - Part 2
   by Bridget Haggerty
   As in many other parts of the world, commercialism has crept into an
   Irish Halloween, so that nowadays, youre just as likely to hear kids
   yelling Trick or Treat as you will Help The Halloween Party, and
   most of them now receive candy instead of the traditional apples and
   nuts. Its also fairly certain that many of them will be disguised as
   their favorite TV or video heroes and heroines and that theyll pester
   their moms and dads to outdo the neighbors when it comes to
   decorations. Still, many of the old customs are still observed,
   especially in the more rural areas.

   How the Irish invented Hallowe'en
   by Brendan Sharkie
   The Celts celebrated Hallowe'en as Samhain, the Feast of the Dead, when
   the deceased revisited the mortal world. This Oiche na Sprideanna
   (Spirit Night) marked the end of summer.
   During the 8th century, the Catholic Church designated the first day of
   November as All Saints Day - all Hallows. Thus All Hallows Eve became
   Hallowe'en. It was an occasion of family reunion after booleying.
   (Booley - a milking place). Booleying was a system of moving cattle and
   sheep to summer pastures on higher ground or distant moorland. Young
   folk and even whole families left the village after the crops were sown
   and migrated to the booley area. Small homes were built with turf or
   sods, or of wicker work, and roofed with branches or heather. A chair
   or two, the cast iron pot, a creel and a few household items would have
   been strapped to the donkey's back. The little churn was slung on one
   side of the animal, into which the youngest child was often thrust, its
   head being the only part visible.

   Ghosts
   by Wm. B Yeats

   Ghosts, or as they are called in Irish, Thevshi or Tash (taidhbhse,
   tais), live in a state intermediary between this life and the next.
   They are held there by some earthly longing or affection, or some duty
   unfulfilled, or anger against the living. "I will haunt you", is a
   common threat; and one hears such phrases as, "She will haunt him, if
   she has any good in her". If one is sorrowing greatly after a dead
   friend, a neighbour will say, "Be quiet now, you are keeping him from
   his rest; or, in the Western Isles, according to Lady Wilde, they will
   tell you, "You are waking the dog that watches to devour the souls of
   the dead". Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are
   believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture,
   and in every way trying to attract attention.

   The Irish Kitchen: Irish Oyster Recipes
   Contributed by Hartson Dowd
   In honour of the annual Oyster Festivals in Galway, our Irish Kitchen
   offers tempting recipes contributed by our resident recipe collector,
   Hartson Dowd. We like our oysters raw on the half-shell with a dash of
   lemon and hot sauce - but we are equally as fond of these tender
   mollusks fried, sautéed, or simmered in stews.

   Kids' Ireland: The Changeling
   Once upon a time in Ireland, there lived a woman called Shiela. Shiela
   had a small baby whom she loved above all else.
   One Saturday morning, she noticed that her baby did not look right. Her
   baby boy was fat, healthy, and happy. This "thing" in her baby's crib
   was thin and looked like a skeleton. It was ugly and had shifty eyes,
   not at all like Shiela's baby. This baby "thing" never stopped crying.
   Shiela was at wit's end. Where was her son? What was in her son's crib?
   And would it never stop wailing?
   Shiela's neighbors came and tried to comfort her. They told her that
   what was in her baby's crib was certainly a changeling. She must ask
   the wise woman what to do.

                             Hallowe'en Customs

   In Ireland long ago, there were no pumpkins. For Hallowe'en, the people
   would carve out a turnip. Immigrants to America brought this tradition
   with them, but they quickly discovered that a big, bright orange
   pumpkin made a much better "Jack O' Lantern!" Other customs they
   brought with them were games such as Snap Apple and Ducking or Bobbing
   for Apples. Irish children didn't go Tricking or Treating as we know
   it; but they did receive gifts of apples and nuts from their friends
   and relatives. They also enjoyed eating Colcannon, a dish made from
   potatoes and cabbage, and for dessert, they often had apple dumplings
   or Stampy cakes made from potatoes and flavored with sugar, caraway
   seeds and cream.

                              A Sunday Blessing

   Bless us oh Lord, You who are
   the peace of all things calm
   the place to hide from harm
   the light that shines in dark
   the heart's eternal spark
   the door that's open wide
   welcoming all to come inside.
   We ask this blessing
   God be willing.

   "Midnight has come and the great Christ Church bell
   And many a lesser bell sound through the room;
   And it is All Souls’ Night.
   And two long glasses brimmed with muscatel
   Bubble upon the table. A ghost may come;
   For it is a ghost’s right..."

                              by Russ Haggerty

   This is my novel. It is largely, but not completely Irish. The
   detective is Irish. The book was created by an Irish monk and a great
   deal of the story is in Ireland. I think you'll enjoy it.
   DO NOT order through the marketplace. If you do you'll get the first
   version, which is incomplete. It's available on Amazon here.
