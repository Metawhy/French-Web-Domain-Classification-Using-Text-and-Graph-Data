Brain Rhythms and Neural Coding of Memory

Principal Investigator: Michaël ZUGARO, DR2 Cnrs

   Our research targets the neuronal mechanisms of integration of
   multisensorial information from the environment with internal signals
   (such as emotions) for the elaboration, memorization and recall of
   spatial representations. The goal of our studies is to better
   understand the neural bases of cognitive processes necessary for an
   animal to survive in its environment, and their relations to adaptive
   behaviours and learned and remembered associations. A principal
   approach is multichannel recordings of ensemble neuronal activity and
   more global brain activity in the form of local field potential
   oscillations in the freely moving animal performing orienting, learning
   and memory tasks. This work focusses on the hippocampal system
   (affected in Alzheimer's disease) which is distinguished by the
   presence of neurons responsive to the position and direction of the
   head in space. These provide tractable experimental models for
   high-level cognitive representations at the level of single neurons and
   neural networks. To understand how this activity is implicated in
   memorization and in informing ongoing behavior, we make simultaneous
   recordings in downstream structures such as prefrontal cortex (affected
   in schizophrenia) and ventral striatum (affected in Parkinson's
   disease). By correlating neurophysiological activity with behavioral
   measures we determine the neural bases of cognitive function.

Projects

   Neuroengineering analyses of neural ensemble activity
   To understand the nature of coding by simultaneously active neurons and
   the coordination of activity in connected areas of brain networks by
   synchronization with brain rhythms and other events measured in local
   field potentials (LFPs). Recent work has shown how hippocampal signals
   help form permanent memory traces in the neocortex. Of particular
   interest is the replay of experience-related neuron activation
   sequences during 'sharp wave/ripples' during slow wave sleep. The role
   of neuromodulators such as noradrenaline is investigated.

   Neural bases of spatial orientation
   Multisensory fusion in the elaboration of brain representations of head
   position and direction
   Research efforts have demonstrated mechanisms of fusion of
   multi-sensory signals such as visual landmark cues, head acceleration
   information detected through the vestibular end-organs in the inner
   ear, optic field flow and locomotion.

   Visual handicap and cortical plasticity
   With optical imagery we will visualize functional maps in the mouse
   visual cortex and characterize the general rules governing their
   development including the roles of homeoproteins (with the Prochiantz
   team) and connexins (with the Rouach team). Another project will study
   the cortical compensatory processes that develop after blindness
   through engagement of audition.
   Trajectories represented by sequences of hippocampal cell assemblies
   During exploration, hippocampal place cells discharge fast sequences of
   action potentials that code for the ongoing spatial trajectory. Each
   sequence occurs during a single cycle of the ongoing 'theta'
   oscillation (~125 ms), and is thus referred to as a 'theta sequence'.
   To determine the mechanisms underlying the formation of theta
   sequences, we record from hippocampal cell ensembles in rats trained to
   run on a miniature treadmill mounted on a model train, and transport
   the rats backwards so that they experience the familiar environment in
   reverse order. Our data will confront models predicting that theta
   sequences should reverse with those predicting they should remain
   unchanged, providing further insight into the mechanisms of theta
   sequence formation.

Pathophysiology of transposable elements in the brain

Principal investigator: Julia Fuchs, CR1 Inserm

   Less than 2% of mammalian genomes are protein-coding, meaning that
   genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA to protein. Until
   recently, the majority of the non-coding genome was considered “junk”
   DNA. However, it is becoming clear that non-coding DNA is crucial for
   cellular function and plays an essential role in gene regulation. The
   major component of non-coding DNA, comprising almost 50% of mammalian
   genomes, are transposable elements (TEs, Fig1), long considered as
   genomic parasites. TEs are intrinsic components of the genomes of
   virtually all living organisms, including humans. TEs had, and a
   minority still has, the ability to move and to modulate genetic
   information and organization and for some, to expand overall genome
   size.
   Fuchs-Fig1-72dpi

   Fig 1: Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in mammalian genomes
   Less than 2% of the human genome is protein coding (red). Almost 50% of
   the human genome consist of remnants of TEs. 21% of those belong to the
   LINE-1 (L1) family, most of which are fossilized. An active L1 contains
   a ≈ 6-7kB full-length (fl) sequence with a promoter in the 5’UTR and
   two open reading frames (ORF1p: RNA binding protein; ORF2p:
   endonuclease and reverse transcriptase). A flL1 element is autonomous
   for mobilization as it contains all the necessary machinery for
   expression and insertion into a new genomic location.

   In our team, we investigate how TEs influence neuronal function and
   dysfunction in mice and humans. In particular, we seek to understand
   how the presence and expression of one class of TEs, Line-1 (L1)
   retrotransposons, influences on the epigenome, on gene expression and
   on the function of neurons. We also investigate the link between L1
   retrotransposons, environmental factors and the aging process. Recent
   data, stemming from different laboratories including our group,
   suggests a novel pathogenic axis in neurodegenerative diseases
   involving epigenetic remodeling linked to the aging process and
   resulting in the dysinhibition of TEs (Fig2). We have recently shown
   that, in adult dopaminergic neurons, which project to the striatum and
   are vulnerable to neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD),
   oxidative stress-induced overexpression of L1 (Fig3) causes DNA strand
   breaks (Fig4) leading to the degeneration of this neuronal population.
   Mice heterozygous for En1 (En1-het), a model for PD, show a
   progressive, adult-onset degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons
   and L1 inhibition partially rescues neurodegeneration in these mice. L1
   retrotransposons become derepressed in post-mitotic neurons under
   oxidative stress conditions, which we have shown earlier, can induce
   heterochromatin relaxation (Fig5). The aging process is known to be
   linked to oxidative stress, an increase in DNA damage and a decrease in
   the DNA repair capacity. However, whether neurodegeneration or
   accelerated aging are causally related to an increase in L1 activity is
   yet unknown. We are currently investigating whether heterochromatin
   relaxation and L1 activation are direct drivers of neurodegeneration
   and whether L1 activation is associated with PD and other
   neurodegenerative disorders. Having successfully used an FDA-approved
   drug (the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor stavudine) to
   prevent neurodegeneration in an acute oxidative-stress model, we
   propose that “anti-L1” strategies might be novel therapeutic targets in
   the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

   Aging, oxidative stress and DNA damage, all intimately linked, lead to
   heterochromatin relaxation and derepression of TE, including LINE-1.
   The endonuclease of LINE-1 (ORF2p) induces DNA double strand breaks,
   further decompacting chromatin and, upon a certain threshold, finally
   leading to cell death once the DNA repair machinery is overwhelmed.

   Another goal of our team is to adress the question whether L1 and their
   proteins have acquired a physiological role in adult neurons. L1 are
   active in post-mitotic neurons and we have observed that L1 RNA and the
   encoded Orf1p protein are expressed in adult neurons in the mouse brain
   (Fig6). We use stereotaxic injections of viral constructs, antisense
   oligonucleotides and Penetratin-coupled siRNA in vivo and
   pharmacological interventions, viral infections, plasmid and siRNA
   transfections in neuronal cell culture in vitro to manipulate L1
   levels. Following gain- and loss-of-function of L1, we make use of the
   tremendous technical advances in sequencing technologies, in the
   adaptation of techniques like chomatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to
   small sample sizes, in methods allowing the isolation of specific
   neuronal populations up to the single cell level such as
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and laser microdissection,
   and bioinformatic approaches helping to approximate the correct mapping
   of sequencing reads to transposable elements. Using these techniques,
   we characterize the expression dynamics of specific L1 genomic loci,
   their chromatin environment and the impact of these dynamics on gene
   expression regulation in individual neuronal populations.
   In summary, our scientific objective is to increase our knowledge about
   the role of transposable elements in brain physiology and pathology.

Brain Rhythms and Neural Coding of Memory

Principal Investigator: Michaël ZUGARO, DR2 Cnrs

   Our research targets the neuronal mechanisms of integration of
   multisensorial information from the environment with internal signals
   (such as emotions) for the elaboration, memorization and recall of
   spatial representations. The goal of our studies is to better
   understand the neural bases of cognitive processes necessary for an
   animal to survive in its environment, and their relations to adaptive
   behaviours and learned and remembered associations. A principal
   approach is multichannel recordings of ensemble neuronal activity and
   more global brain activity in the form of local field potential
   oscillations in the freely moving animal performing orienting, learning
   and memory tasks. This work focusses on the hippocampal system
   (affected in Alzheimer's disease) which is distinguished by the
   presence of neurons responsive to the position and direction of the
   head in space. These provide tractable experimental models for
   high-level cognitive representations at the level of single neurons and
   neural networks. To understand how this activity is implicated in
   memorization and in informing ongoing behavior, we make simultaneous
   recordings in downstream structures such as prefrontal cortex (affected
   in schizophrenia) and ventral striatum (affected in Parkinson's
   disease). By correlating neurophysiological activity with behavioral
   measures we determine the neural bases of cognitive function.

Projects

   Neuroengineering analyses of neural ensemble activity
   To understand the nature of coding by simultaneously active neurons and
   the coordination of activity in connected areas of brain networks by
   synchronization with brain rhythms and other events measured in local
   field potentials (LFPs). Recent work has shown how hippocampal signals
   help form permanent memory traces in the neocortex. Of particular
   interest is the replay of experience-related neuron activation
   sequences during 'sharp wave/ripples' during slow wave sleep. The role
   of neuromodulators such as noradrenaline is investigated.

   Neural bases of spatial orientation
   Multisensory fusion in the elaboration of brain representations of head
   position and direction
   Research efforts have demonstrated mechanisms of fusion of
   multi-sensory signals such as visual landmark cues, head acceleration
   information detected through the vestibular end-organs in the inner
   ear, optic field flow and locomotion.

   Dr. A. Arleo, CNRS, UPMC, Paris 6

   Visual handicap and cortical plasticity
   With optical imagery we will visualize functional maps in the mouse
   visual cortex and characterize the general rules governing their
   development including the roles of homeoproteins (with the Prochiantz
   team) and connexins (with the Rouach team). Another project will study
   the cortical compensatory processes that develop after blindness
   through engagement of audition.
   Trajectories represented by sequences of hippocampal cell assemblies
   During exploration, hippocampal place cells discharge fast sequences of
   action potentials that code for the ongoing spatial trajectory. Each
   sequence occurs during a single cycle of the ongoing 'theta'
   oscillation (~125 ms), and is thus referred to as a 'theta sequence'.
   To determine the mechanisms underlying the formation of theta
   sequences, we record from hippocampal cell ensembles in rats trained to
   run on a miniature treadmill mounted on a model train, and transport
   the rats backwards so that they experience the familiar environment in
   reverse order. Our data will confront models predicting that theta
   sequences should reverse with those predicting they should remain
   unchanged, providing further insight into the mechanisms of theta
   sequence formation.

Pathophysiology of transposable elements in the brain

Principal investigator: Julia Fuchs, CR1 Inserm

   Less than 2% of mammalian genomes are protein-coding, meaning that
   genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA to protein. Until
   recently, the majority of the non-coding genome was considered “junk”
   DNA. However, it is becoming clear that non-coding DNA is crucial for
   cellular function and plays an essential role in gene regulation. The
   major component of non-coding DNA, comprising almost 50% of mammalian
   genomes, are transposable elements (TEs, Fig1), long considered as
   genomic parasites. TEs are intrinsic components of the genomes of
   virtually all living organisms, including humans. TEs had, and a
   minority still has, the ability to move and to modulate genetic
   information and organization and for some, to expand overall genome
   size.
   Fuchs-Fig1-72dpi

   Fig 1: Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in mammalian genomes
   Less than 2% of the human genome is protein coding (red). Almost 50% of
   the human genome consist of remnants of TEs. 21% of those belong to the
   LINE-1 (L1) family, most of which are fossilized. An active L1 contains
   a ≈ 6-7kB full-length (fl) sequence with a promoter in the 5’UTR and
   two open reading frames (ORF1p: RNA binding protein; ORF2p:
   endonuclease and reverse transcriptase). A flL1 element is autonomous
   for mobilization as it contains all the necessary machinery for
   expression and insertion into a new genomic location.

   In our team, we investigate how TEs influence neuronal function and
   dysfunction in mice and humans. In particular, we seek to understand
   how the presence and expression of one class of TEs, Line-1 (L1)
   retrotransposons, influences on the epigenome, on gene expression and
   on the function of neurons. We also investigate the link between L1
   retrotransposons, environmental factors and the aging process. Recent
   data, stemming from different laboratories including our group,
   suggests a novel pathogenic axis in neurodegenerative diseases
   involving epigenetic remodeling linked to the aging process and
   resulting in the dysinhibition of TEs (Fig2). We have recently shown
   that, in adult dopaminergic neurons, which project to the striatum and
   are vulnerable to neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD),
   oxidative stress-induced overexpression of L1 (Fig3) causes DNA strand
   breaks (Fig4) leading to the degeneration of this neuronal population.
   Mice heterozygous for En1 (En1-het), a model for PD, show a
   progressive, adult-onset degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons
   and L1 inhibition partially rescues neurodegeneration in these mice. L1
   retrotransposons become derepressed in post-mitotic neurons under
   oxidative stress conditions, which we have shown earlier, can induce
   heterochromatin relaxation (Fig5). The aging process is known to be
   linked to oxidative stress, an increase in DNA damage and a decrease in
   the DNA repair capacity. However, whether neurodegeneration or
   accelerated aging are causally related to an increase in L1 activity is
   yet unknown. We are currently investigating whether heterochromatin
   relaxation and L1 activation are direct drivers of neurodegeneration
   and whether L1 activation is associated with PD and other
   neurodegenerative disorders. Having successfully used an FDA-approved
   drug (the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor stavudine) to
   prevent neurodegeneration in an acute oxidative-stress model, we
   propose that “anti-L1” strategies might be novel therapeutic targets in
   the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

   Aging, oxidative stress and DNA damage, all intimately linked, lead to
   heterochromatin relaxation and derepression of TE, including LINE-1.
   The endonuclease of LINE-1 (ORF2p) induces DNA double strand breaks,
   further decompacting chromatin and, upon a certain threshold, finally
   leading to cell death once the DNA repair machinery is overwhelmed.

   Another goal of our team is to adress the question whether L1 and their
   proteins have acquired a physiological role in adult neurons. L1 are
   active in post-mitotic neurons and we have observed that L1 RNA and the
   encoded Orf1p protein are expressed in adult neurons in the mouse brain
   (Fig6). We use stereotaxic injections of viral constructs, antisense
   oligonucleotides and Penetratin-coupled siRNA in vivo and
   pharmacological interventions, viral infections, plasmid and siRNA
   transfections in neuronal cell culture in vitro to manipulate L1
   levels. Following gain- and loss-of-function of L1, we make use of the
   tremendous technical advances in sequencing technologies, in the
   adaptation of techniques like chomatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to
   small sample sizes, in methods allowing the isolation of specific
   neuronal populations up to the single cell level such as
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and laser microdissection,
   and bioinformatic approaches helping to approximate the correct mapping
   of sequencing reads to transposable elements. Using these techniques,
   we characterize the expression dynamics of specific L1 genomic loci,
   their chromatin environment and the impact of these dynamics on gene
   expression regulation in individual neuronal populations.
   In summary, our scientific objective is to increase our knowledge about
   the role of transposable elements in brain physiology and pathology.

Neural Circuits and Behavior

Principal Investigator: Alexander FLEISCHMANN, CR1 Inserm (en disponibilité),
Associate Professor of Neuroscience, Brown University

   Our goal is to understand how neural circuits generate sensory
   perception and behavior. To address this question we use a combination
   of molecular genetic, in vivo imaging, computational and behavioral
   approaches, and we focus our efforts on determining fundamental
   functional properties of neural networks in the mouse olfactory cortex.
   A central question in neuroscience is how sensory stimuli are detected
   and processed by neural circuits in the brain to generate sensory
   perception and behavior. Our laboratory has recently developed new
   molecular genetic and viral approaches that allow us to target and
   manipulate defined neural cell types in the olfactory cortex of mice.
   Furthermore, we have identified, using in vivo two-photon microscopy,
   electrophysiological recordings and computational approaches,
   fundamental principles of odor information coding in cortical neural
   networks. These recent advances open up new opportunities to explore
   how diverse neural cell types contribute to odor information coding in
   the cortex, and how this information is transmitted to downstream
   target areas involved in sensory integration, cognition, and motor
   control. Finally, we are interested in how learning and experience
   alter olfactory neural network functions and behavior.
   The olfactory system of mice provides a simple, tractable model system
   of outstanding ethological importance. Furthermore, olfactory neural
   circuits are particularly vulnerable to aging and neurodegenerative
   disease, thus representing a highly relevant experimental model system
   for clinical and translational neuroscience research.

   Figure 1. Expression of the layer-specific genes in neocortex and
   olfactory cortex.
   (Left) Coronal section of the adult mouse brain. (Right)
   Immunohistochemical analysis of Cux1 and Ctip2 expression in neocortex
   (top) and olfactory (piriform) cortex (bottom). Note that superficial
   and deep layer-specific gene expression patterns are reversed, and that
   in contrast to neocortex, Cux1 and Ctip2 are co-expressed in a
   subpopulation of piriform neurons (insert, in yellow). Cux1 and Ctip2
   specify piriform neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb and the
   medial prefrontal cortex (for details, see Diodato et al., Nature.
   Comm., 2016).

   tract (LOT) and two-photon calcium imaging of olfactory bulb mitral
   cells. (B) Two-photon micrograph showing GCaMP3 expression in mitral
   cell of a single imaging site. Scale bar = 30µM. (C) Example traces of
   the responses of 4 mitral cells (circled in (B)) to 4 different
   odorants. Traces represent responses to 4 individual odorant exposures,
   non-responsive trials are shown in grey, responsive trials in black.
   Horizontal bar indicates odorant application.
