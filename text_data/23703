About

   CPP is an international forum on theoretical and practical topics in
   all areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education, that
   consider certification as an essential paradigm for their work.
   Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some sort,
   preferably with production of independently checkable certificates.

   Follow this link for more information about the CPP series.

   CPP 2017 is co-located with POPL 2017, in Paris, France. Registration
   and accommodation information will mostly be available on that site.

Topics of interest

   We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal
   certification of programs and proofs. The following is a suggested list
   of topics of interests to CPP. This is a non-exhaustive list and should
   be read as a guideline rather than a requirement.
     * certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS
       kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors;
     * program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;
     * certified decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and
       mathematical theorems;
     * proof assistants and proof theory;
     * new languages and tools for certified programming;
     * program analysis, program verification, and proof-carrying code;
     * certified secure protocols and transactions;
     * certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,
       polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of
       interest;
     * certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,
       first-order logic, and higher-order unification;
     * certificates for program termination;
     * logics for certifying concurrent and distributed programs;
     * higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and logics
       for security;
     * teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.
