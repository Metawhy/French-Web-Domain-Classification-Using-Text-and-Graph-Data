Committed to Your Privacy

What we do

   At Affectv, we're dedicated to the highest standards of consumer
   privacy. Our technology and processes are regularly audited by ABC and
   EDAA to ensure we meet industry best practices of consumer data privacy
   and any data we collect will only be used in accordance with all
   applicable laws and GDPR.

Our Technology & Service

   Affectv provides technology services to advertisers that enable them to
   serve relevant online advertising to consumers who are browsing the
   World Wide Web. Our goal is to provide a more relevant experience to
   you, the consumer, by displaying useful and informative advertising
   content that is appropriate and engaging. Besides the relevancy of the
   ads you see in this way, your online experience remains effective and
   inexpensive so that most content online remains free for you to view.
   By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in
   this privacy policy.

   Our technology collects and uses online interaction data to improve the
   relevance of advertising which appears on web pages. 'Interaction data'
   consists of anonymous information regarding the relationships between
   people, the website pages they visit and/or the actions they take on a
   website, such as sharing URLs or other content using different
   electronic devices such as laptops, tablets or mobile phones. For
   example, Affectv may collect interaction data when you visit one of our
   client's webpages or browse on the internet or when you interact with
   friends by sharing online content.

   Our clients use the interaction data we capture to identify and
   categorise consumers who are likely to share similar interests or
   preferences based on observed online behavioural patterns. For example,
   if a person expresses an interest in comedy films, our technology would
   help our clients identify other people who are likely to enjoy comedy
   films based on similarities in interaction data between the different
   people. By using our technology, our clients categorize users with
   similar characteristics or interests, improving their ability to
   deliver more relevant advertising to you.

Our Cookies

   Affectv, like many other media and online advertising websites, uses
   cookies. Cookies are small text files that sit on your internet
   browser, and they are placed so websites know that you've been to their
   website before. Cookies contribute to a better online experience when
   you browse a website and allow for improvements of the website by
   enabling web statistics collection. For example, when you visit your
   most popular social network, they will log you in to your account
   automatically by using cookies.

   Cookies are traditionally classified into two general categories; there
   are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies expire by
   the end of your browsing activity. These are mostly used to store
   shopping choices and enable the checkout process in online shopping.
   Persistent cookies are stored in a user's browser and remain there
   after a browsing session has ended for a longer period of time. These
   type of cookies are common in online and target advertising. Affectv
   uses persistent cookies to collect data over time and identify online
   behavioural patterns. You can identify our cookies in your browser as
   go.affec.tv. The persistent cookies we use to improve the relevancy of
   advertising are set to expire after 1 year. Devices on which we can
   place cookies include computers, laptops, mobile and tablet devices.

Your Data

   We collect data via online identifiers, such as cookies, IP addresses
   and third-parties, to target consumers and track consumer interactions
   with the advertising. These identifiers may reveal a consumerâ€™s
   location, device ID, transactional information, timestamp and websites
   visited.

   We use cookies to collect, aggregate and process mainly analytical and
   interactive data so we can understand which computer browsers have
   viewed which content on a website; which websites are most visited from
   which geographical location and which other browsers and users you may
   have interacted with. For example, if you share a photo with another
   user and you subsequently click on an advert, based on the above
   interaction we capture, we may serve the same advert to the person you
   shared the photo with.

   Affectv maintains anonymous analytical and interaction data for up to
   12 months with the aim to use it to classify users with similar
   characteristics or interests into general categories. After 12 months,
   interaction data is no longer used for these purposes, but it is used
   for research and statistics reporting on an aggregated basis for as
   long as this data is relevant.

Opt Out & Choices

   If you would still not like to have ads tailored to your interests,
   please click here to opt out. This will stop you receiving ads by
   Affectv. If you would like to opt out of other targeted ads from other
   providers, please go here.

   Alternatively, you can disable cookies in your internet browser
   (usually by selecting Tools-Options-Privacy).

   But remember, cookies are used for a variety of reasons, not just
   online advertising, and so by deleting them you may affect your online
   browsing experience. Opting out of Affectv cookies does not mean you
   will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that Affectv
   will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage
   patterns. The Affectv Opt-out Tool is cookie-based. In order for the
   tool to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept
   cookies. Be advised that if you change computers or upgrade or change
   browsers, clear or delete this opt out cookie either separately or by
   clearing all cookies of your browser or if you use multiple computers
   or browsers, you will need to repeat this opt-out process for each
   computer and each browser.

Information Security

   The security of your information is important to us. We have
   implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in
   our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This
   includes, but is not limited to, the use of firewalls and encryption.
   No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
   storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use
   commercially acceptable means to protect your information, like most
   companies, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

   We may share Non-PII collected via our technology with affiliated third
   parties, including behavioural patterns, interaction data collected as
   above described and general statistics. For example, we may disclose
   that our online advertisements offering "sports car" test drives
   receive more clicks than those offering "Mini Van" test drives. This
   information is only used in an aggregated form and cannot be used to
   contact or identify any person individually. We encourage our media
   partners and our clients to comply fully with the EU regulations and
   recommendations on cookies use and online privacy issued by the
   relevant online advertisement organisations and institutions, but we do
   not undertake any responsibility with regards to their policies. We
   strongly recommend you to read the respective Privacy Policies of any
   website you visit.

   If you have any questions or comments about our security policies,
   please send us an email at privacy@affectv.com or write to us at:
   Affectv, 1 Mark Square, London, EC2A 4EG

   Regards,

   The Affectv team.
