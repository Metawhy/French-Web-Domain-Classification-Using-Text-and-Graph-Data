   “Why do I have this?” “Does it fit?” “What does this piece say about

   If Satan wanted to derail your attempts to grow in godliness, how do
   you think he’d accomplish it? Do you think he’d tempt you with
   reeeeally big, bad sins? Probably not. I think he’d use distractions or
   busyness…or how about an undisciplined life? We don’t […]

   Motherhood: Gospel Hope for Everyday Moments is truly a breath of fresh

   One of the advantages of age is that you’ve actually experienced life
   and learned a few things. “You Learn By Living” as Eleanor Roosevelt
   would say, and it’s true. So many of our misconceptions are corrected
   by simply living. I was thinking about some of […]

   Several years ago, I was struggling with one of those mother of

   earth shattering, but frustrating and completely unexpected. I

My Diary

Post ID:

   The fight for a disciplined, godly life is like cleaning the junk out
   of your closet.

   Sometimes you have to go through your stuff and ask, “Why do I have
   this?” “Does it fit?” “What does this piece say about me?”  “Is this
   necessary?Appropriate?”

   As you sort through your closet, you might find items you haven’t worn
   in ten years, old scuffed shoes, high heels that pinch, unflattering
   pieces, those what-was-I-even-thinking!?!- pieces, or items that are no
   longer appropriate for your life.  If it’s just taking up space, if
   it’s no longer useful or serving you well, and is no longer a
   reflection of you as a person, it gets the Marie Kondo treatment! It
   has to go!

   micheile-henderson-FpPcoOAk5PI-unsplash

   When we evaluate our goals and priorities as women who love God, we
   need to take inventory of our lives and purposefully “lay aside” (take
   off, get rid of) anything that harms us, slows us down, distracts us,
   keeps us stuck in ruts, or zaps our energy.

   We have to say no EVEN GOOD THINGS in order to do the good works that
   our Father has planned for us.

   Some of us need to get rid of extras: oversleeping, overspending,
   overeating,  over-talking, over-emoting, over scrolling.

   ben-white-4Bs9kSDJsdc-unsplash

   Others might need to choose to add to and put on: punctuality,
   follow-through, trustworthiness, trusting more, praying more, studying
   more, fellowshipping more, exercising more, contributing more, loving
   more, forgiving more.

   emma-simpson-mNGaaLeWEp0-unsplash

   Others may need to sort through: wrong attitudes, conflicting
   priorities, unhealthy friendships, heart issues and idols, paranoid or
   obsessive thoughts.

   ana-tavares-VDwINWBdX0Y-unsplash

   Think of those extra weights, no matter how beloved, as chains around
   your ankles, dead weight,  slowing your progress, making everything
   disorganized and harder.

Whatever the Lord brings to mind, can you deal with it appropriately this
week?

   Sometimes the simple mindset of: “OK, Lord, I’m __ years old and I’ve
   had enough of this in my life. It hasn’t brought me happiness. It’s a
   lie I’m hanging on to for security and I know my security is in you.
   Help me to be done with this.”

   or

   “Lord, you’ve told me to love this person, and I’ve chosen not to do
   that. It’s been ___ years that I’ve held on to this
   indifference/jealousy/anger/hatred and I’m ready to repent of all those
   years of sin and finally do what is right before you. I love you enough
   now to want to obey.”

   Or

   “Lord, I’ve struggled with over ________ (fill in the blank:
   overeating, drinking, talking, spending, worry, anger) my whole life.
   I’ve used it to fill a void only you were meant to satisfy.  It’s been
   a temporary comfort but hasn’t brought the lasting joy I sought. It has
   been a liar, and where it offered me happiness, it’s only brought me
   ______(the consequence of the excess:  more weight, alcoholism, debt,
   unstable emotions, broken relationships, etc…) Help me to believe that
   your Word is the truth and that your ways are the ways of life, peace,
   and joy.”

     “Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of
     witnesses, let us lay aside every weight (hinderance) and the sin
     that so easily entangles (ensnares) us and let us run with
     perserverance the race marked out for us.” Hebrews 12:1


     “Christian women need to get rid of every association, habit, and
     tendency that impedes godliness.” Barbara Hughes


   Imagine that the women in your life (daughters, nieces, women in your
   church, neighbors) are looking at you as a representative of Christ.
   They know you claim Christ, so are they learning sound doctrine from
   your words and actions or are they learning a skewed gospel? If they
   followed your actions, would you be leading them in godliness or
   worldliness?

   In my circles, we’re keen to promote sound doctrine, but can I just be
   frank? Knowing sound doctrine is good. Really good. But if you are not
   living it, you are teaching “false doctrine” by your life. When lips
   say one thing, but actions preach another, your “cloud of witnesses” is
   harmed as well as your testimony. Those “little hindrances” are really
   a big deal, not only to you but to the next generation who is watching
   your life and realizing that they can’t fully follow in your footsteps.

   So what is it you need to clean out of your life during this 8-week
   study?

   What is keeping you from winning in the race marked out for you?
     * Maybe you need to check the purity of your heart?
     * Maybe you say you love and know God but you are failing to adhere
       to His commandments (“If you love me, keep my commandments.) or
       failing to love the people He died for? (“By this will all men know
       that you are my disciples if you have love one for another.”)
     * Maybe you need to simply set an alarm clock, start an exercise
       routine, or eat smaller portions. (“But I discipline my body, and
       bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I
       myself should become disqualified.” 1 Cor. 9:27
     * Maybe you need to shed unhealthy friendships or those who’d deter
       you from seeking God with all your heart, soul, and mind.
     * Maybe you simply need to speak less.
     * Maybe you need to shut off your phone and open your Bible.
     * Maybe you need to ask someone for forgiveness.
     * God’s plans for you are good! He hasn’t set you up for failure when
       He planned out your life.

   The gospel that saved you from your biggest threat (eternal separation
   from God) is the gospel that can save you from the smaller sins we
   struggle with on a daily basis.

     “His diving power has given us everything we need for life and
     godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own
     glory and goodness.” 2 Peter 1:3

   Whatever God brings to your mind, get rid of that obstacle so you can
   run unhindered in your pursuit of godliness.
