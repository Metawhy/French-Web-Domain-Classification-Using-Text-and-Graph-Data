Learn to Program. For Free.

   Learning to program makes you a smarter and more capable human being.
   Computers are not only the most common tool we encounter in our
   day-to-day lives, but also the most powerful. Even if your plans don't
   include becoming a software engineer writing code for the next Mars
   mission, you can find value in learning to code.

   Rocket science uses programming, but programming isn't rocket science.
   Whether you're preparing for a software career, an office worker with a
   folder full of spreadsheet files, or a hobbyist interested in making
   indie video games, the Python programming language is a great way to
   get started in the world of programming.

   I'm Al Sweigart, and I write books to teach beginners to code. I put
   them online for free, because programming is too valuable and needs to
   be accessible to all. (Though I sell print and ebooks to pay rent.)

   Get started. It's a great journey.

   More Info

     "Introductions to Python are easy to find. But at the end of the day
     most Python tutorials for beginners end up being the same lessons
     repackaged, often leaving the new programmer with gaping holes in
     how their newly acquire skills can be applied practically. This is
     not one of those books. Where this book stands out is the second
     part where you actually build useful tools you might need to use
     every day. The author does a fantastic job of bridging the concepts
     and skills you learned earlier to real world applications."

   Nicholas Sarlo Read full Amazon review

     "This book is totally appropriate for someone who has never
     programmed before. Everything is explained, right from the ground
     up, in a lively, interesting style which doesn't dumb things down."

   J. Hartley, tartley.com Read full Amazon review

     "I am a college professor who occasionally teaches courses for
     liberal arts students. [...] I offered a game programming course in
     the Python programming language using Sweigart's book. The students
     loved this book. It starts at the very beginning and leads them,
     game by fascinating game, to become highly capable programmers."

   Dr. Robert C. Gann Read full Amazon review

     "I'm halfway through this book and very pleased. I have never seen a
     programming book so accessible to complete beginners. It really gave
     me the jump start I needed. I use it alongside other resources, but
     it continues to be the easiest to absorb."

   Jared Walters Read full Amazon review

     "I used to write a column on a greek magazine about learning Python
     and PyGame. [...] Since I found this book, every time the topic of
     learning programming is mentioned - especially from a person
     interested on making games - I point people to it."

   Konstantinos Michalopoulos Read full Amazon review

     "It is difficult to write a clear and easy to understand book on
     programming for a beginner. It is even more difficult to write a
     clear and understandable book on cryptography for a beginner. To do
     both at the same time is nearly impossible, but this author has
     nailed it."

   students, administrators, and anyone who uses a computer how to write
   small, practical programs to automate tasks on their computer.

   You don't need to know all the complexities of algorithms and syntax,
   you just want to write basic programs to automate mundane computer
   tasks. In the process, even total beginners will learn to use Python to
   control their computers without having to learn complex information
   about computer science. This is a practical programming guide for the
   rest of us.
