AllJoyn

AllJoyn Open Source Project

   AllJoyn is an open source software framework that makes it easy for
   devices and apps to discover and communicate with each other.
   Developers can write applications for interoperability regardless of
   transport layer, manufacturer, and without the need for Internet
   access. The software has been and will continue to be openly available
   for developers to download, and runs on popular platforms such as Linux
   and Linux-based Android, iOS, and Windows, including many other
   lightweight real-time operating systems.

   In October 2016, the AllSeen Alliance who sponsored the AllJoyn
   Project, and the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) merged. One result
   of the merger was the creation of the OCF Resource to AllJoyn Interface
   Mapping specification to assist vendors migrating from AllJoyn to OCF.
   The specification includes detailed mapping information to provide
   equivalency between AllJoyn defined Interfaces and OCF defined
   Resources. It also provides mapping for Device Types (AllJoyn to/from
   OCF), identifies equivalent OCF Resources for both mandatory and
   optional AllJoyn interfaces, and for each interface defines the
   detailed Property by Property mapping using OCF defined extensions to
   JSON schema to programmatically define mappings.

   Now in its final major release, AllJoyn has been tested, deployed and
   improved to create products, apps, services that connect and
   communicate across dozens of product lines.
