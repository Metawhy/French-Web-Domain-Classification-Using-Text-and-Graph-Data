Thank you for your participation to DX-15.


   Location

   The 26th International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis (DX-2015)
   will be held August 31 to September  3, 2015 in Paris, France.

Scope

   The International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis (DX) is an annual
   event that started in 1989 and is rooted in the Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) community. This annual international workshop has been uniting
   researchers and practitioners with diverse backgrounds (Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), verification, software engineering, debugging, ...)
   in order to leverage research in the global context of diagnosis, that
   is, identifying the root causes for encountered issues. The DX Workshop
   series has been offering a forum to present current research and
   experience reports, exchange and discuss emerging ideas, as well as
   debate current issues and envisioned future challenges.
   Papers presented at the workshop cover a variety of theories,
   principles, and computational techniques for diagnosis, monitoring,
   testing, reconfiguration, fault- adaptive control, and repair of
   complex systems. Applications of these theories, principles, and
   techniques to industry-related disciplines and other real-world
   problems are also important topics of the workshop.
   Like the previous workshops in this series, DX-2015 encourages the
   interactions and the exchange of theories, techniques, applications,
   and experiences amongst researchers and practitioners from diverse
   backgrounds – artificial intelligence, control theory, verification,
   software and systems engineering, and other related areas – who share
   an interest in different aspects of diagnosis, and the related fields
   of testing, reconfiguration, maintenance, prognosis, and fault-adaptive
   control.
   DX is a lively forum that has traditionally adopted a single track
   program with a limited number of participants in order to promote
   detailed technical exchange and debate while at the same time making
   efforts to develop synergistic approaches to solving real-world
   problems.

Co-location with Safeprocess'2015

   This year, DX-15 will be held in conjunction with the 9th IFAC
   Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical
   Processes. This triennial symposium is a major international event that
   gathers leading experts (academics and industrials) of the FDI
   community (Fault Detection and Isolation). This colocation will be a
   great opportunity for better exchanges between the DX and the FDI
   communities. Some sessions shared by DX and SAFEPROCESS will be
   organized on September 3rd.
