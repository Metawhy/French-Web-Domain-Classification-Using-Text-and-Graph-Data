   HTC had been looking to reboot its long-dead Wildfire series with new
   releases this year. We recently reported about the HTC Wildfire X

   Doug Lynch August 12, 2019
   Many of us have been sporting LineageOS 16 on our devices for most of
   the year but that isn't the case for everyone. Throughout the year
   we've seen the list of supported LOS 16 devices grow. This month, in
   particular, has been great for Samsung devices with official support

HTC stops selling phones in the UK due to patent dispute

   Adam Conway August 5, 2019
   Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC isn't dead, although it may as
   well be in the UK. Due to a patent dispute with Munich-based research
   and development company Ipcom, the company has pulled its smartphones
   from the UK market. The patent specifically pertains to car phones,
   which HTC agreed in 2012 to sell their phones in the...

[Update 2: Rolling out in Europe] HTC finally rolls out Android Pie for the

   Tushar Mehta August 1, 2019
   HTC's smartphone business is far from rewarding but it may not be
   giving up anytime soon. The phonemaker has shifted its focus to 5G and
   smartphones that facilitate blockchain transactions and applications.
   For its existing devices, the company is not turning a blind eye to the
   devices that deserve an Android Pie update. Earlier this...

   Mishaal Rahman July 8, 2019
   For the past few months, the once-great Taiwanese smartphone brand HTC
   has struggled to convince us that it's still relevant. After Google
   acquired 2,000 of HTC's smartphone engineers and Valve moved ahead with
   its new own Index VR system, it doesn't look like there's much left for
   HTC to do. The company recently shifted its...

   The last few years have been rough for Taiwanese smartphone brand HTC.
   While the brand is certainly capable of designing decent smartphones,
   it can't seem to keep up with the current trends of the smartphone
   industry. Although it isn't giving up on smartphones, its focus has
   shifted away from flagships and toward the blockchain and...

   Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC isn't exactly winning any awards in

   HTC may have been the first company to craft the first commercial
   Android smartphone, but more than a decade later, it has been reduced

   Aamir Siddiqui May 10, 2019
   HTC may not have given up on smartphones just yet, but there is little
   left for consumers to stick around for. The Taiwanese OEM, which was
   once a contender for the pole position for the top Android smartphone
   brand, is now trying hard to attract new customers or even keep the old
   ones. HTC's plans...

   Lava launches HTC Wildfire X in India with MediaTek Helio P22 for
   ₹9,999 ($140)
   August 14, 2019 2:45am Aamir Siddiqui

Lava launches HTC Wildfire X in India with MediaTek Helio P22 for ₹9,999
($140)

   HTC had been looking to reboot its long-dead Wildfire series with new
   releases this year. We recently reported about the HTC Wildfire X
   making an appearance in the Google Play Console Device Catalog and the
   Android Enterprise Recommended website, complete with its MediaTek
   Helio P22 MT6762 SoC and HD+ display. HTC has now officially launched
   the Wildfire X in India as a Flipkart-exclusive, but there’s a catch —
   this isn’t the very same HTC that we have known and loved, but just the
   brand which has been licensed to InOne Smart Technology, also known in
   India for their Lava-branded smartphones.

   Lava International Ltd. was one of India’s domestic players, competing
   in the high days before the entry of Chinese players like Xiaomi in the
   budget and early mid-range segments. We do not know what happened to
   Lava International Ltd., but we do know that the Lava branding now
   comes under InOne Smart Technology, a division within InOne Group which
   is based in China. InOne Group’s India office has the same address as
   Lava International’s Indian office, so there’s definitely a juristic
   and corporate relationship here. What we do know is that HTC was
   looking to license its smartphone branding to players like Micromax,
   Karbonn or Lava, and the new HTC Wildfire X is being launched by InOne
   Smart Technology in India as per their press release, essentially
   creating a branding relationship between Lava and HTC.

   InOne’s (or Lava’s) HTC Wildfire X comes with a 6.22″ HD+ (1520 x 720)
   IPS LCD with a waterdrop notch for the camera. The phone bears
   dimensions 156.7 mm x 74.9 mm x 7.95 mm. The press release for the
   phone skips out on specifying the SoC inside the phone, but we do know
   from previous coverage that the Wildfire X comes with the MediaTek
   Helio P22 (MT6762) SoC. The phone comes in RAM (DDR4X) and storage
   options of 3GB + 32GB or 4GB + 128GB. If you opt for the base model
   with a paltry 32GB internal storage, you still have the option of
   expanding the memory through the hybrid microSD card slot. The phone is
   powered by a 3,300 mAh battery “with AI technology“, with support for
   10W charging only through the USB Type-C port. Thankfully, the phone
   launches with Android 9 Pie and comes with a headphone jack.

   InOne Lava HTC Wildfire X

   As far as cameras are concerned, the phone interestingly comes with a
   triple rear camera setup involving a 12MP, 1.25μm main sensor, an 8MP
   sensor for 2x optical zoom and a 5MP depth sensor. The front camera is
   an 8MP shooter.

   The InOne HTC Wildfire X will be a Flipkart exclusive and will be
   available for purchase from August 22, 2019. The device will cost
   ₹9,999 ($140) for the 3GB/32GB variant and ₹12,999 ($183) for the
   4GB/128GB variant. One of the other features that stood out was the
   fact that InOne is offering a six months no-questions-asked accidental
   and liquid damage protection, along with complimentary pickup and drop
   facility, alongside the concurrent 1-year warranty.

   The HTC Wildfire X, as it is launched in 2019 by HTC’s official
   licensee in India, InOne Smart Technology, is a product that is
   difficult to recommend. The phone and its existence go on to show why
   exactly Chinese OEMs flourished in the Indian market at the cost of
   domestic Indian players because domestic players are often far out of
   touch with their own market. The base variant of the Wildfire X
   directly competes against the base variant of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7S
   which comes with a much more powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 660
   processor, a bigger 4000 mAh battery with Quick Charge 4 support, a
   48MP rear camera, an FHD+ display, as well as Xiaomi’s after-sales
   infrastructure and brand goodwill in India. The only advantage the
   Wildfire X has is its 2x optical zoom camera, the practical utility of
   which remains arguable. The HTC/Lava/InOne Wildfire X is, sadly, dead
   on arrival.

   LineageOS 16 adds support for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and HTC One M8
   August 12, 2019 2:38pm Doug Lynch

LineageOS 16 adds support for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and HTC One M8

   Many of us have been sporting LineageOS 16 on our devices for most of
   the year but that isn’t the case for everyone. Throughout the year
   we’ve seen the list of supported LOS 16 devices grow. This month, in
   particular, has been great for Samsung devices with official support
   reaching the Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 and Galaxy A7 2017 a little over a
   week ago. Then a week later official support was announced for the
   Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. The good news continues
   as multiple variants of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are officially
   supported along with the addition of the HTC One M8 too.

   Samsung Galaxy Note 3 XDA Forum

   In typical Samsung fashion, we have a number of versions which were
   launched back in 2013. Of those, LineageOS 16 is now officially
   available on the LTE models with builds ready to be downloaded for the
   International (N9005/P), China (N9008V), South Korea, (N900K/L/S), and
   T-Mobile (N900T/V/W8) versions. These devices are now supported and
   have two nightly builds to choose from thanks to the additional work
   put in by XDA Senior Member haggertk and XDA Senior Member npjohnson.

     * Samsung Galaxy Note 3 LTE (Korea, N900K/L/S)

   HTC One M8 XDA Forum

   HTC can also rejoice as their beloved HTC One M8 is now officially
   added to the LineageOS 16 roster. As One M8 owners likely know, this
   device was released in two different variants with one having a single
   SIM slot and the other having a secondary SIM slot. Official builds
   have just begun (only one nightly build available as of writing this)
   thanks to the additional work of XDA Recognized Developer bgcngm. So,
   if you own any version of these two smartphones then you can now look
   into installing an official Android 9 Pie-based version of LineageOS on
   it.

   HTC stops selling phones in the UK due to patent dispute
   August 5, 2019 9:37pm Adam Conway

HTC stops selling phones in the UK due to patent dispute

   Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC isn’t dead, although it may as
   well be in the UK. Due to a patent dispute with Munich-based research
   and development company Ipcom, the company has pulled its smartphones
   from the UK market. The patent specifically pertains to car phones,
   which HTC agreed in 2012 to sell their phones in the UK with a
   workaround. However, Ipcom confirmed via testing that HTC did not
   implement the workaround, and instead continued to violate the patent.
   Ipcom said HTC had failed to “play by the rules” and had displayed
   “disregard for the law by contravening a UK court ruling”.

   HTC UK patent

   HTC’s official response was rather candid. In a statement given to the
   BBC, a spokeswoman for the company said that “As a leading innovator,
   HTC takes intellectual property issues very seriously. We are
   proactively investigating an infringement claim by a third party with
   respect to a single handset model.” The company has stopped selling all
   of its phones in the UK on its website, even though devices are
   available to purchase in other European countries. In the UK, Carphone
   Warehouse, O2, and EE have already stopped selling its phones. The only
   places to buy HTC smartphones at the moment in the UK is via Amazon,
   who are still selling the company’s phones for now. HTC’s VR headsets
   and 5G router are still being sold.

   HTC has continued to hemorrhage money each year, with the company
   renewing its focus entirely for 2019. HTC has released some odd devices
   in recent times though, including a blockchain-powered Exodus 1 which
   apparently sold out within a month of its release. The company has
   struggled to get a foothold in the UK market, and this may be its final
   death blow. Xiaomi was accused in the UK of a similar violation way
   back in February of this year by Ipcom, though that dispute is still
   ongoing.

   [Update 2: Rolling out in Europe] HTC finally rolls out Android Pie for
   the U11, starting in Taiwan
   August 1, 2019 12:45pm Tushar Mehta

[Update 2: Rolling out in Europe] HTC finally rolls out Android Pie for the
U11, starting in Taiwan

   Update 2 (08/01/19 @ 12:45 PM ET): HTC has restarted the rollout of
   Android Pie for the HTC U11 in Europe.

   Update 1 (06/05/19 @ 01:30 AM ET): HTC is pulling the update back after
   reports that it is soft-bricking devices. A better update should arrive
   the coming Thursday. HTC is offering free service to those troubled by
   it.

   HTC’s smartphone business is far from rewarding but it may not be
   giving up anytime soon. The phonemaker has shifted its focus to 5G and
   smartphones that facilitate blockchain transactions and applications.
   For its existing devices, the company is not turning a blind eye to the
   devices that deserve an Android Pie update. Earlier this month, HTC
   announced that HTC U11, U11+, and the U12+ will shortly start receiving
   the update to Android Pie, and the first of these devices is starting
   to get a taste of Pie.

   According to a couple of Twitter users, the HTC U11 is starting to
   receive the Android Pie update. Currently, we only have reports of the
   update being available to users HTC’s home country, Taiwan. We do
   expect the update to be available in other regions but cannot ascertain
   the timeline for the rollout, just yet.

     HTC U11(TaiWan Version) get Update pic.twitter.com/WJPXuGcRhD

     — jus (@jus30402886) May 27, 2019

   As per the screenshot, the Android Pie update for the HTC U11 is 1.36GB
   in size and will bump the build number to 3.22.709.2 of Sense UI. The
   update brings system enhancements but the changelog does not elaborate
   upon these changes. It also removes Google+ (RIP) from BlinkFeed, HTC’s
   news discovery app. There is no mention of an upgraded UI, as you would
   usually expect with the Android Pie update. As for the stability, one
   user says that there are a bunch of bugs and if you’re one of the lucky
   recipients, we’d urge you to share your experience.

   HTC is definitely a laggard in terms of the Pie update, with the HTC
   U11 Life being an exception – probably because it is an Android One
   device. In the meantime, the company is also expected to be baking the
   update for HTC U12+, which gets Pie in June, and the HTC U11+, which is
   expected to follow later next month. We will update you when we learn
   about the rollout in other countries.
     __________________________________________________________________

Update 1: HTC U11 update is being pulled back

   HTC is pulling the update back because it is leading to soft-bricking
   of some of the devices. The company notes some users are unable to
   unlock their devices using the PIN or the pattern. It is offering free
   service to those need to get their U11 fixed.

   HTC has also said that a fresh update should be expected to roll out on
   Thursday, June 6th. For information about service centers where you can
   walk in and get your smartphone fixed, see this page.

   Thanks to XDA Recognized Developer j to the 4n for the tip.
     __________________________________________________________________

Update 2: Rolling out in Europe

   After pausing the update two months ago, HTC is rolling out Android Pie
   to the HTC U11 again. People in Europe have reported receiving the
   update on their devices. The update is slightly smaller than before
   (1.31GB), but the changelog is exactly the same.
