At Quilon, our philosophy is simple. We aim to convey our passion for
South-west coastal Indian cuisine, through a quest for perfect ingredients
and technique, plus a deep-seated desire to continue learning how to evolve
and blend old traditions and modern tastes.

   Quilon opened in 1999 and quickly established South-west coastal Indian
   cuisine on the international food-lovers map, winning a Michelin star
   in 2008 which we have retained ever since. Our menu embodies a unique
   blend of ethnic and progressive dishes with seafood at its heart but
   also offering meat, poultry and vegetarian dishes, mostly designed for
   sharing.

   Chef Sriram will also be delighted to propose a tasting menu,
   tailor-made to  your particular palate, and a world-class wine list
   specially selected to complement our cuisine.

Division Bell

   Due to its popularity with Lords, Ladies, Ministers and Members of
   Parliament, Quilon is one of the few Michelin-starred restaurants with
   its own Division Bell. When a Division is imminent, Members are alerted
   by a bell that rings throughout Parliamentary buildings, summoning
   Members of Parliament to the Division Lobbies. For the rest of us at
   Quilon there is free wi-fi.

   A Division Bell is rung in the immediate vicinity of the Palace of
   Westminster to signal there is eight minutes before a vote. Division
   Bell is also the name of Pink Floyd's fourteenth album.

CONTEMPORARY INDIAN FOOD & ART

   Quilon features specially commissioned artworks from the highly
   acclaimed Indian artist Paresh Maity, who in a short but prolific
   career was in 2014 awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India –
   the fourth highest civilian award. He says “water colours are my heart
   & soul” perfectly complementing Quilon’s love affair with South-west
   coastal cuisine.
