   Rent a car in Rome with Europcar
   With its ancient monuments, legendary art and inimitable food scene,
   Rome is one of the oldest and most beautiful cities in the world.
   Located in the middle of Italy, north of Naples and south of Bologna,
   there are few ...Read more cities that can rival the living museum of
   Rome.
   With Europcar car rental you can easily see all the city has to offer,
   as well as having the freedom to explore out-of-town locations.
   The Europcar car rental experience in Rome
   Europcar has 13 stations across Rome. Ciampino and Fiumicino Airport
   stations are the most convenient options if you are flying into the
   city - collect your car straight after you land. Our Europcar fleet
   includes city cars such as the Fiat 500 as well as larger models such
   as the Renault Mégane station wagon.
   Looking for something bigger? Van rental is available from several
   Europcar Rome stations, allowing you to transport larger loads.
   To help you make the most of your time in Rome, you can pick up your
   car rental from one station and drop it off at a different one at the
   end of your trip. Plus, reserve your car or van for long or short
   rental periods to suit you. Read less

Driving in Rome

   In Italy, the national speed limit is 130 km/h on autostrade, 110 km/h
   on main roads, and 90 km/h on secondary roads. In urban areas, the
   speed limit is set between 50 and 70 km/h, indicated by signs. Adjust
   your speed according to the terrain, where there are narrow or steep
   roads, tunnels and around populated areas, such as near schools.

   In wet weather conditions, the speed limit is reduced to 90 km/h on
   roads outside built-up areas and 110 km/h on autostrade.

   In built-up areas, parking is permitted on the right-hand side of roads
   with two-way traffic. In a one-way street, it is allowed on both sides
   of the street, but only if there is at least three meters of space left
   in the road.

   In Rome, blue road signs and markings indicate paid parking zones.
   White road markings mean parking time is limited but free. Yellow
   parking bays are reserved for special vehicles, police, disabled
   drivers etc. On Sundays and public holidays, it is often free to park.
   In the historic center, there is a ZTL (Zona Traffico Limitato)
   enforced Monday to Saturday evening, with differing access hours. Only
   residents or card holders can enter this zone. Be aware that this area
   is monitored by cameras and you will be fined if you enter without a
   permit.

   Many main roads across Italy are toll autostrade, and charges can be
   paid with cash or credit/debit card.

   Be aware that not all gas stations in Italy are open on Sundays, and
   those that are often close on Mondays.

   Discover Rome and its surroundings by car

   Rome is rightly renowned for its art galleries, historical monuments,
   and gelaterias but there is much more to see in the areas surrounding
   the city too. Tivoli, 40 minutes away by car, is a town in the region
   of Lazio to the northeast of Rome with beautiful gardens and Hadrian's
   Villa. Ostia Antica, the harbor of ancient Rome (also 40 minutes away),
   is a well-preserved archeological site with magnificent frescoes and
   impressive mosaics.

   Travel south and you can experience the stunning Amalfi coast and the
   home of pizza, Naples, 145 miles away. Or to the north, there is the
   Renaissance powerhouse of Florence (140 miles).

   If you feel like spending some time outdoors, Lake Bracciano is a great
   destination. This volcanic lake is one of the largest in Italy, and
   actually provides drinking water for Rome itself! It is a beautiful
   place to spend a day in the open air, and the castle nearby is also
   well worth a visit. Lake Bracciano is 50 minutes by car from Rome.

   Other things to see in Rome

   Where to start? There is more history than you can possibly see in one
   visit – but the Colosseum, St Peter’s Basilica, and the Pantheon are
   most people’s top three for sightseeing. The city is a living testament
   to its history and developments throughout the years. Matching the
   prestigious culture of the city is an equally esteemed food reputation.
   Homely trattorias, Michelin-starred restaurants, terrace
   cafés...experience the gastronomic prowess of Rome.

   If you’re inclined towards some shopping then the Via Condotti, one of
   the most fashionable streets in the world, is definitely the place to
   go.

   Rent a car in Barcelona with Europcar
   Barcelona hardly needs an introduction. The vibrant capital of
   Catalonia, with its long, sandy beach, winding Gothic streets, and the
   buzzing bars and restaurants of Las Ramblas, has gained a well-deserved
   reputation ...Read more for enjoyable city breaks. Whether it’s a
   romantic getaway, a weekend with friends or a family vacation,
   Barcelona truly has something for everyone.
   If you want to explore more of what Spain has to offer, head north to
   the Costa Brava, or stay more local and explore the mountains behind
   the city. Barcelona is ideally situated just a short distance from the
   French border and with regular car ferries to Ibiza and Mallorca. Rent
   a car from Europcar Barcelona, and explore this unique city and its
   beautiful surroundings.
   The Europcar rental experience in Barcelona
   There really is no shortage of options when it comes to car rental in
   Barcelona. With 14 branches in and around the city, including two at
   Barcelona El Prat Airport and another at the central train station, you
   are sure to find a location that suits your needs.
   If you are looking for something small for travelling to and from the
   beach, popular choices are the Fiat 500 or Nissan Micra. If you are
   travelling with a larger group or just need a bit more space, check out
   the Volkswagen Touran or Seat Alhambra.
   Europcar Barcelona also offers a comprehensive selection of vans for
   rental, from the compact Peugeot Partner 3M3 to the Iveco Daily 10M3.
   We are completely flexible, allowing you to rent for days, weeks or
   even months at a time.

Driving in Barcelona

   In the city the speed limit is 50 km/h, while on country roads it is 90
   km/h and on freeways it is 120 km/h.

   Street parking in Barcelona is not recommended, as it is highly
   regulated and you risk having your car towed away. There are a number
   of multi-story parking garages, with prices starting at €2.80 per hour.
   Hotels often make their onsite parking lots available to non-guests,
   generally at a cost of around €15 per day.

   Discover Barcelona and the surrounding area by car

   Tourism is the main industry here, and with good reason. From the long
   sandy beach of Barceloneta to the Sagrada Família cathedral, and eight
   World Heritage Sites, the city has no shortage of history, culture and
   entertainment. Thanks to its proud culinary tradition, you can sample
   local specialties such as fresh fish, iberico ham, manchego cheese and
   fat, juicy olives, at one of the covered markets or the buzzing tapas
   bars of the Gothic quarter.

   Surrounded by mountains and miles of unspoilt coastline, Barcelona is
   ideally situated for getting a taste of all that Catalonia has to
   offer. Head out into the countryside for the day, travel onwards to the
   islands of Ibiza and Mallorca, or hug the coastline and venture south
   to Valencia, 220 miles away.

   One of the most iconic attractions in Barcelona, Parc Güell is located
   on the northern edge of the city. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the
   park designed by Antoni Gaudi is a first-class example of Barcelona
   modernism, with spectacular views over the city and the coastline. Full
   of ornate and mystical iconography, long stretches of mosaics and
   bright, colorful statues and sculptures, Parc Güell is not to be
   missed. Drive up to the park early and avoid the crowds.

   Port Aventura, the largest amusement park in Spain, lies 70 miles south
   of Barcelona. Boasting 42 rides and rollercoasters, two water parks and
   the newly opened Ferrari Land, there is plenty to keep the whole family
   entertained. Ample parking is available for €12 per day. And with the
   seaside towns of Salou and Tarragona close by, you can make the most of
   your trip with a rental from Europcar.

   Things to do in Barcelona

   Home to the Picasso Museum, an impressive contemporary art museum
   (MACBA) whose forecourt is a skateboarding mecca, and the Joan Miró
   Foundation in the foothills of Montjuic, culture in Barcelona is second
   to none. Hop from museum to museum, enjoying local food such as
   anchovies, chickpeas and ‘bombas’ in between. If you really want to get
   a taste of life among the locals, drive out to the Camp Nou stadium and
   catch a Barca match for an atmosphere like no other.

   Rent a car in Lisbon with Europcar
   With sweeping plazas, vintage streetcars rattling along cobbled
   streets, multi-colored boutiques, and trendy bars, Lisbon has
   undeniable charm. The seven hills overlooking the city all give great
   views of the capital ...Read more and the surrounding countryside.
   Renting a car in Portugal gives the opportunity to explore further
   afield from Lisbon, and there is certainly plenty to see nearby. On the
   south coast of Portugal is Cascais (20 miles from the capital); and the
   lush greenery of Sintra-Cascais Natural Park is also not too far away.

The Europcar rental experience in Lisbon

   Choose from a number of Europcar stations to collect your car in
   Lisbon. There is a branch at Lisbon Airport, and several downtown,
   including a 24-hour service. Wherever is most convenient for you, you
   will find a Europcar station to get your Portugal adventure started.

   If you are looking for something small to drive around the city, the
   Renault Clio 5P and Renault Twingo 3D are reliable options for economy
   car rental. Larger groups and families can choose the Renault Mégane or
   Audi A3 to travel in comfort and style.

   Moving heavier loads? Europcar Lisbon also offers a fleet of vans, with
   small and large models. Renting with Europcar means the ultimate
   flexibility for your travels, with cars and vans available on a short-
   or long-term basis.

   Driving in Lisbon

   In addition to a valid driver’s license from your country of residence,
   it is a good idea to have your photo ID or passport with you at all
   times when driving through Portugal.

   In urban areas the speed limit is usually 50 km/h, but can vary as
   indicated by signposts. On rural roads it is 90 km/h and on freeways
   120 km/h. Speed limits around residential areas and schools are usually
   40 km/h.

   On-street parking in the city center is difficult due to the narrow and
   steep streets. If you need to park downtown, it is advisable to use one
   of the underground garages. Paid parking hours are Monday to Friday,
   between 8am and 8pm, and Saturdays from 8am to 6pm. There is cheaper
   parking available in lots south of downtown, charging €5-6 per day.

   There are several toll roads in Portugal with charges payable in cash,
   by credit/debit card or via an electronic system. There are different
   types of electronic tolls: Easy Toll, Toll Card, Toll Service and Via
   Verde Visitors. Easy Toll is connected to your credit card and
   automatically charges when you travel through tollgates; Toll Card and
   Toll Service use a prepaid voucher system, while Via Verde is a
   wireless device you attach to your car.

   Discover Lisbon and the surrounding area by car

   While you are in Lisbon, be sure to head over to Almada across the bay,
   where the Cristo Rei statue is located. Climb to the top of this sacred
   Catholic monument for exceptional views over the city. Just a 20-minute
   drive via the IP7 bridge road, which crosses the Tagus River, it is a
   stunning journey in itself.

   Lisbon’s location means you can really maximize your time in Portugal,
   exploring the nearby coastline and surrounding area. You should
   definitely visit the expansive Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, and with
   Europcar car hire, it couldn’t be easier to travel there. Pena Palace
   (20 miles), Cresmina Dune, Praia do Guincho and the Palace of Sintra
   are just some of the magical attractions you can find nearby.

   The National Palace of Queluz, seven miles north of Lisbon, is a
   worthwhile day trip. Behind the stunning yellow and green exterior of
   the stately building is a collection of magnificent Baroque, Rococo,
   and neoclassical pieces. The manicured gardens are wonderful for an
   afternoon stroll.

   Driving on from Lisbon, you can visit Leiria (80 miles), a medieval
   university town, and the magical town of Tomar (85 miles). Both are
   around an hour and a half’s drive north of the capital.

   A 15-minute drive from downtown is the beautiful palace of Ajuda, built
   in 1795 in a neoclassical style but with renovations since adding
   architectural features from different styles. The majestic interiors
   are open to the public, including several private chambers, and the
   staterooms where galas were held. The grounds include the Jardim
   Botânico da Ajuda, the first botanical garden in Portugal, known for
   its geometric layout. The Palace of Ajuda also houses a large
   collection of decorative arts dating from the 15th to the 20th
   centuries, including jewelry, textiles, furniture, paintings, and
   sculpture.

   The chic seaside town of Cascais is known for its beautiful beaches and
   superior seafood restaurants. The chosen summer retreat of the royal
   family during the late 1800s, Cascais is still very cosmopolitan, with
   a picture-perfect historic center, sandy beaches, whimsical museums,
   and trendy boutiques. Make sure you visit the Palácio da Cidadela de
   Cascais and the Castro Guimarães Museum to appreciate their unique
   architectural styles. Cascais is a quick half-hour drive along the
   coast east of Lisbon.

   Things to see in Lisbon

   This UNESCO protected city is full of diverse districts, each offering
   a unique perspective. Great things to see include the traditional
   Alfama, with its Moorish architecture and hilltop castle; the cultural
   offerings of Lisbon Baixa, with the Archaeological Centre dedicated to
   the ruins dating back to the Iron Age; and the oldest confectionery
   shop in the country, opened in 1829. The Belém neighbourhood houses the
   Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, a Unesco-listed monastery with awe-inspiring
   cloisters, gargoyles and Renaissance woodcarvings.

   Rent a car in Rome with Europcar
   With its ancient monuments, legendary art and inimitable food scene,
   Rome is one of the oldest and most beautiful cities in the world.
   Located in the middle of Italy, north of Naples and south of Bologna,
   there are few ...Read more cities that can rival the living museum of
   Rome.
   With Europcar car rental you can easily see all the city has to offer,
   as well as having the freedom to explore out-of-town locations.
   The Europcar car rental experience in Rome
   Europcar has 13 stations across Rome. Ciampino and Fiumicino Airport
   stations are the most convenient options if you are flying into the
   city - collect your car straight after you land. Our Europcar fleet
   includes city cars such as the Fiat 500 as well as larger models such
   as the Renault Mégane station wagon.
   Looking for something bigger? Van rental is available from several
   Europcar Rome stations, allowing you to transport larger loads.
   To help you make the most of your time in Rome, you can pick up your
   car rental from one station and drop it off at a different one at the
   end of your trip. Plus, reserve your car or van for long or short
   rental periods to suit you. Read less

Driving in Rome

   In Italy, the national speed limit is 130 km/h on autostrade, 110 km/h
   on main roads, and 90 km/h on secondary roads. In urban areas, the
   speed limit is set between 50 and 70 km/h, indicated by signs. Adjust
   your speed according to the terrain, where there are narrow or steep
   roads, tunnels and around populated areas, such as near schools.

   In wet weather conditions, the speed limit is reduced to 90 km/h on
   roads outside built-up areas and 110 km/h on autostrade.

   In built-up areas, parking is permitted on the right-hand side of roads
   with two-way traffic. In a one-way street, it is allowed on both sides
   of the street, but only if there is at least three meters of space left
   in the road.

   In Rome, blue road signs and markings indicate paid parking zones.
   White road markings mean parking time is limited but free. Yellow
   parking bays are reserved for special vehicles, police, disabled
   drivers etc. On Sundays and public holidays, it is often free to park.
   In the historic center, there is a ZTL (Zona Traffico Limitato)
   enforced Monday to Saturday evening, with differing access hours. Only
   residents or card holders can enter this zone. Be aware that this area
   is monitored by cameras and you will be fined if you enter without a
   permit.

   Many main roads across Italy are toll autostrade, and charges can be
   paid with cash or credit/debit card.

   Be aware that not all gas stations in Italy are open on Sundays, and
   those that are often close on Mondays.

   Discover Rome and its surroundings by car

   Rome is rightly renowned for its art galleries, historical monuments,
   and gelaterias but there is much more to see in the areas surrounding
   the city too. Tivoli, 40 minutes away by car, is a town in the region
   of Lazio to the northeast of Rome with beautiful gardens and Hadrian's
   Villa. Ostia Antica, the harbor of ancient Rome (also 40 minutes away),
   is a well-preserved archeological site with magnificent frescoes and
   impressive mosaics.

   Travel south and you can experience the stunning Amalfi coast and the
   home of pizza, Naples, 145 miles away. Or to the north, there is the
   Renaissance powerhouse of Florence (140 miles).

   If you feel like spending some time outdoors, Lake Bracciano is a great
   destination. This volcanic lake is one of the largest in Italy, and
   actually provides drinking water for Rome itself! It is a beautiful
   place to spend a day in the open air, and the castle nearby is also
   well worth a visit. Lake Bracciano is 50 minutes by car from Rome.

   Other things to see in Rome

   Where to start? There is more history than you can possibly see in one
   visit – but the Colosseum, St Peter’s Basilica, and the Pantheon are
   most people’s top three for sightseeing. The city is a living testament
   to its history and developments throughout the years. Matching the
   prestigious culture of the city is an equally esteemed food reputation.
   Homely trattorias, Michelin-starred restaurants, terrace
   cafés...experience the gastronomic prowess of Rome.

   If you’re inclined towards some shopping then the Via Condotti, one of
   the most fashionable streets in the world, is definitely the place to
   go.

Driving in Barcelona

   In the city the speed limit is 50 km/h, while on country roads it is 90
   km/h and on freeways it is 120 km/h.

   Street parking in Barcelona is not recommended, as it is highly
   regulated and you risk having your car towed away. There are a number
   of multi-story parking garages, with prices starting at €2.80 per hour.
   Hotels often make their onsite parking lots available to non-guests,
   generally at a cost of around €15 per day.

   Discover Barcelona and the surrounding area by car

   Tourism is the main industry here, and with good reason. From the long
   sandy beach of Barceloneta to the Sagrada Família cathedral, and eight
   World Heritage Sites, the city has no shortage of history, culture and
   entertainment. Thanks to its proud culinary tradition, you can sample
   local specialties such as fresh fish, iberico ham, manchego cheese and
   fat, juicy olives, at one of the covered markets or the buzzing tapas
   bars of the Gothic quarter.

   Surrounded by mountains and miles of unspoilt coastline, Barcelona is
   ideally situated for getting a taste of all that Catalonia has to
   offer. Head out into the countryside for the day, travel onwards to the
   islands of Ibiza and Mallorca, or hug the coastline and venture south
   to Valencia, 220 miles away.

   One of the most iconic attractions in Barcelona, Parc Güell is located
   on the northern edge of the city. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the
   park designed by Antoni Gaudi is a first-class example of Barcelona
   modernism, with spectacular views over the city and the coastline. Full
   of ornate and mystical iconography, long stretches of mosaics and
   bright, colorful statues and sculptures, Parc Güell is not to be
   missed. Drive up to the park early and avoid the crowds.

   Port Aventura, the largest amusement park in Spain, lies 70 miles south
   of Barcelona. Boasting 42 rides and rollercoasters, two water parks and
   the newly opened Ferrari Land, there is plenty to keep the whole family
   entertained. Ample parking is available for €12 per day. And with the
   seaside towns of Salou and Tarragona close by, you can make the most of
   your trip with a rental from Europcar.

   Things to do in Barcelona

   Home to the Picasso Museum, an impressive contemporary art museum
   (MACBA) whose forecourt is a skateboarding mecca, and the Joan Miró
   Foundation in the foothills of Montjuic, culture in Barcelona is second
   to none. Hop from museum to museum, enjoying local food such as
   anchovies, chickpeas and ‘bombas’ in between. If you really want to get
   a taste of life among the locals, drive out to the Camp Nou stadium and
   catch a Barca match for an atmosphere like no other.

   Rent a car in Lisbon with Europcar
   With sweeping plazas, vintage streetcars rattling along cobbled
   streets, multi-colored boutiques, and trendy bars, Lisbon has
   undeniable charm. The seven hills overlooking the city all give great
   views of the capital ...Read more and the surrounding countryside.
   Renting a car in Portugal gives the opportunity to explore further
   afield from Lisbon, and there is certainly plenty to see nearby. On the
   south coast of Portugal is Cascais (20 miles from the capital); and the
   lush greenery of Sintra-Cascais Natural Park is also not too far away.

The Europcar rental experience in Lisbon

   Choose from a number of Europcar stations to collect your car in
   Lisbon. There is a branch at Lisbon Airport, and several downtown,
   including a 24-hour service. Wherever is most convenient for you, you
   will find a Europcar station to get your Portugal adventure started.

   If you are looking for something small to drive around the city, the
   Renault Clio 5P and Renault Twingo 3D are reliable options for economy
   car rental. Larger groups and families can choose the Renault Mégane or
   Audi A3 to travel in comfort and style.

   Moving heavier loads? Europcar Lisbon also offers a fleet of vans, with
   small and large models. Renting with Europcar means the ultimate
   flexibility for your travels, with cars and vans available on a short-
   or long-term basis.

   Driving in Lisbon

   In addition to a valid driver’s license from your country of residence,
   it is a good idea to have your photo ID or passport with you at all
   times when driving through Portugal.

   In urban areas the speed limit is usually 50 km/h, but can vary as
   indicated by signposts. On rural roads it is 90 km/h and on freeways
   120 km/h. Speed limits around residential areas and schools are usually
   40 km/h.

   On-street parking in the city center is difficult due to the narrow and
   steep streets. If you need to park downtown, it is advisable to use one
   of the underground garages. Paid parking hours are Monday to Friday,
   between 8am and 8pm, and Saturdays from 8am to 6pm. There is cheaper
   parking available in lots south of downtown, charging €5-6 per day.

   There are several toll roads in Portugal with charges payable in cash,
   by credit/debit card or via an electronic system. There are different
   types of electronic tolls: Easy Toll, Toll Card, Toll Service and Via
   Verde Visitors. Easy Toll is connected to your credit card and
   automatically charges when you travel through tollgates; Toll Card and
   Toll Service use a prepaid voucher system, while Via Verde is a
   wireless device you attach to your car.

   Discover Lisbon and the surrounding area by car

   While you are in Lisbon, be sure to head over to Almada across the bay,
   where the Cristo Rei statue is located. Climb to the top of this sacred
   Catholic monument for exceptional views over the city. Just a 20-minute
   drive via the IP7 bridge road, which crosses the Tagus River, it is a
   stunning journey in itself.

   Lisbon’s location means you can really maximize your time in Portugal,
   exploring the nearby coastline and surrounding area. You should
   definitely visit the expansive Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, and with
   Europcar car hire, it couldn’t be easier to travel there. Pena Palace
   (20 miles), Cresmina Dune, Praia do Guincho and the Palace of Sintra
   are just some of the magical attractions you can find nearby.

   The National Palace of Queluz, seven miles north of Lisbon, is a
   worthwhile day trip. Behind the stunning yellow and green exterior of
   the stately building is a collection of magnificent Baroque, Rococo,
   and neoclassical pieces. The manicured gardens are wonderful for an
   afternoon stroll.

   Driving on from Lisbon, you can visit Leiria (80 miles), a medieval
   university town, and the magical town of Tomar (85 miles). Both are
   around an hour and a half’s drive north of the capital.

   A 15-minute drive from downtown is the beautiful palace of Ajuda, built
   in 1795 in a neoclassical style but with renovations since adding
   architectural features from different styles. The majestic interiors
   are open to the public, including several private chambers, and the
   staterooms where galas were held. The grounds include the Jardim
   Botânico da Ajuda, the first botanical garden in Portugal, known for
   its geometric layout. The Palace of Ajuda also houses a large
   collection of decorative arts dating from the 15th to the 20th
   centuries, including jewelry, textiles, furniture, paintings, and
   sculpture.

   The chic seaside town of Cascais is known for its beautiful beaches and
   superior seafood restaurants. The chosen summer retreat of the royal
   family during the late 1800s, Cascais is still very cosmopolitan, with
   a picture-perfect historic center, sandy beaches, whimsical museums,
   and trendy boutiques. Make sure you visit the Palácio da Cidadela de
   Cascais and the Castro Guimarães Museum to appreciate their unique
   architectural styles. Cascais is a quick half-hour drive along the
   coast east of Lisbon.

   Things to see in Lisbon

   This UNESCO protected city is full of diverse districts, each offering
   a unique perspective. Great things to see include the traditional
   Alfama, with its Moorish architecture and hilltop castle; the cultural
   offerings of Lisbon Baixa, with the Archaeological Centre dedicated to
   the ruins dating back to the Iron Age; and the oldest confectionery
   shop in the country, opened in 1829. The Belém neighbourhood houses the
   Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, a Unesco-listed monastery with awe-inspiring
   cloisters, gargoyles and Renaissance woodcarvings.

   Europcar in Australia
   Renting a car in Australia is a cost-effective way to explore the wild
   and diverse landscapes that the country has to offer. From city cars
   and vans to luxury rentals, Europcar Australia has a huge range of
   models to help you maximize ...Read more your enjoyment.
   Europcar Australia has 116 stations, widely spread across the country.
   The most popular pickup points include cities like Brisbane, as well as
   stations found along surfer’s paradise - Gold Coast. Sydney Airport and
   Melbourne Airport are amongst the most popular, allowing you to pick up
   your rental and get on the road straight after you’ve landed.
   Europcar car rental specific offers and benefits in Australia
   Rent a car in Australia and you’ll get access to several exclusive
   offers with Europcar.
   Your vacation time is precious. We get that, which is why we created
   Online Check-In. This express car rental pick up service is designed to
   get you out on the road as soon as possible, and the best part is…
   it’s a free service. Most stations in Australia have a dedicated Ready
   desk, meaning no fuss and no waiting in line. Complete any paperwork
   and payment details beforehand, and you can save valuable time at the
   check-in desk.
   If you want to live the high life, the Selection service allows you to
   drive the car of your dreams in the 140 countries Europcar website
   covers. Whether you’re more Mercedes, Jaguar, or BMW - choose between
   them all.
   Driving in Australia
   To rent a car in Australia, you must have a valid driver’s licence
   issued in the country you live in as well as piece of ID with you.
   Factor in long distances when you travel, especially in rural or remote
   areas. There are rest areas every 50 to 60 miles on highways. Extreme
   weather conditions often affect driving: be aware of flood or bushfire
   warnings when you travel. In some areas, a four-wheeled drive is
   advised.
   The national speed limit is 110 km/h on highways. There are some
   variations, including the Northern Territory which is 130 km/h. On
   two-lane roads the limit is 100 km/h, in built up areas it lowers to 50
   km/h and to 40 km/h near schools.
   There are payable tolls on highways around major cities in Australia.
   Some use a fully electronic system so you’ll need to buy an e-tag pass
   to pay. These can be bought in advance or paid online up to 3 days
   after you’ve passed through the toll.
