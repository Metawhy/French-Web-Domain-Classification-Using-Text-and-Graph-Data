More of Africa scarred by fires than thought
       Burn scars near Cape Town
       4 February 2019
       Wildfires can cause devastation and are also to blame for more than
       a quarter of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.
       Satellites play a key role in mapping landscape scarred by fire –
       but the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission has revealed that there are
       more fires than previously thought.
       From the vantage of space, satellites can be used to detect fires
       and monitor how they spread and, in the first instance, this can
       often help relief efforts. However, satellites are also important
       for mapping the scars that fires leave in their wake, particularly
       in remote regions.
       It is currently estimated that fires contribute 25–35% of total
       annual greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere so more precise
       information gained from satellite-based scar-burn maps could help
       to better understand how they add to the greenhouse effect.
       Land disturbed by fire is an ‘essential climate variable’, which
       are global datasets for the key components of Earth’s climate.
       Fire-scar mapping is also used for managing natural resources,
       assessing fire risk and for adopting mitigating strategies, for
       example.
       Thanks to Copernicus Sentinel-2’s ability to zoom in on our planet,
       researchers have discovered that there are more areas being
       affected by fire than previously thought.
       A paper published recently in Remote Sensing of the Environment
       describes how researchers used the high-resolution imaging
       capability of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission to produce the
       first detailed continental map of burns caused by wildfires.
       Sentinel-2 is a two-satellite constellation built for the EU’s
       Copernicus environmental monitoring programme. Each identical
       satellite carries a high-resolution multispectral imager. The
       mission has a myriad of uses, particularly related to monitoring
       the health of world’s vegetation and mapping how the surface of our
       land changes.
       The authors focused on sub-Saharan Africa as the region accounts
       for around 70% of burned area worldwide according to global
       satellite databases, making it the ideal testbed for evaluating the
       potential for improving the understanding of global impacts of
       fire.
       Copernicus Sentinel-2 reveals more fires than thought
       They found that 4.9 million sq km of land had been burned in 2016,
       which is 80% more than reported with information from
       coarser-resolution satellite sensors. These new-found areas
       comprised mainly burned areas smaller than 100 ha.
       Although usually not as catastrophic as large fires, small fires
       are linked to land-use change, particularly if they have been set
       to clear land for agriculture or grazing.
       Lead author, Ekhi Roteta from the University of the Basque Country,
       said, “This increase in the amount of burned area and the fact that
       it is made up of small areas came as no surprise as Copernicus
       Sentinel-2 has a resolution of 20 m, more than ten times the zoom
       of other satellite instruments.
       “The additional impact of these small fires may be underrepresented
       which suggests an increase in the contribution to greenhouse gas
       emissions. It would therefore be useful to include these data in
       existing climate models.
       “The next step would be to create a global map of burned areas at
       20 m resolution to reveal the evidence of more small fires, which
       in turn could lead to greater clarity on greenhouse gas emissions,
       land-cover change and land management.”
       The research and data product were developed in the framework of
       the Fire Disturbance project, part of ESA’s Climate Change
       Initiative. It involved processing 11 000 Copernicus Sentinel-2
       images. The product is named FireCCISFD11 and is publicly available
       from the CCI Open Data Portal. The project is also generating
       global burned area products from Copernicus Sentinel-3 sensors, as
       well as radar algorithms for detecting burned areas in cloudy
       regions.

World-first firing of air-breathing electric thruster
       Air-breathing ion thruster
       5 March 2018
       In a world-first, an ESA-led team has built and fired an electric
       thruster to ingest scarce air molecules from the top of the
       atmosphere for propellant, opening the way to satellites flying in
       very low orbits for years on end.
       ESA’s GOCE gravity-mapper flew as low as 250 km for more than four
       years thanks to an electric thruster that continuously compensated
       for air drag. However, its working life was limited by the 40 kg of
       xenon it carried as propellant – once that was exhausted, the
       mission was over.
       Replacing onboard propellant with atmospheric molecules would
       create a new class of satellites able to operate in very low orbits
       for long periods.
       Air-breathing space mission
       Air-breathing electric thrusters could also be used at the outer
       fringes of atmospheres of other planets, drawing on the carbon
       dioxide of Mars, for instance.
       “This project began with a novel design to scoop up air molecules
       as propellant from the top of Earth’s atmosphere at around 200 km
       altitude with a typical speed of 7.8 km/s,” explains ESA’s Louis
       Walpot.
       Test set-up
       A complete thruster was developed for testing the concept by Sitael
       in Italy, which was performed in a vacuum chamber in their test
       facilities, simulating the environment at 200 km altitude.
       A ‘particle flow generator’ provided the oncoming high-speed
       molecules for collection by the Ram-Electric Propulsion novel
       intake and thruster.
       There are no valves or complex parts – everything works on a
       simple, passive basis. All that is needed is power to the coils and
       electrodes, creating an extremely robust drag-compensation system.
       Air-breathing electric propulsion
       The challenge was to design a new type of intake to collect the air
       molecules so that instead of simply bouncing away they are
       collected and compressed.
       The molecules collected by the intake designed by QuinteScience in
       Poland are given electric charges so that they can be accelerated
       and ejected to provide thrust.
       Thruster inside vacuum chamber
       Sitael designed a dual-stage thruster to ensure better charging and
       acceleration of the incoming air, which is harder to achieve than
       in traditional electric propulsion designs.
       “The team ran computer simulations on particle behaviour to model
       all the different intake options,” adds Louis, “but it all came
       down to this practical test to know if the combined intake and
       thruster would work together or not.
       “Instead of simply measuring the resulting density at the collector
       to check the intake design, we decided to attach an electric
       thruster. In this way, we proved that we could indeed collect and
       compress the air molecules to a level where thruster ignition could
       take place, and measure the actual thrust.
       Thruster with xenon propellant
       “At first we checked our thruster could be ignited repeatedly with
       xenon gathered from the particle beam generator.”
       As a next step, Louis explains, the xenon was partially replaced by
       a nitrogen–oxygen air mixture: “When the xenon-based blue colour of
       the engine plume changed to purple, we knew we’d succeeded.
       “The system was finally ignited repeatedly solely with atmospheric
       propellant to prove the concept’s feasibility.
       Thruster with air
       “This result means air-breathing electric propulsion is no longer
       simply a theory but a tangible, working concept, ready to be
       developed, to serve one day as the basis of a new class of
       missions.”
       This project was backed through ESA’s Technology Research Programme
       for developing promising new ideas for space, with the support of
       the Agency's Earth Observation Programme.

More of Africa scarred by fires than thought
       Burn scars near Cape Town
       4 February 2019
       Wildfires can cause devastation and are also to blame for more than
       a quarter of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.
       Satellites play a key role in mapping landscape scarred by fire –
       but the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission has revealed that there are
       more fires than previously thought.
       From the vantage of space, satellites can be used to detect fires
       and monitor how they spread and, in the first instance, this can
       often help relief efforts. However, satellites are also important
       for mapping the scars that fires leave in their wake, particularly
       in remote regions.
       It is currently estimated that fires contribute 25–35% of total
       annual greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere so more precise
       information gained from satellite-based scar-burn maps could help
       to better understand how they add to the greenhouse effect.
       Land disturbed by fire is an ‘essential climate variable’, which
       are global datasets for the key components of Earth’s climate.
       Fire-scar mapping is also used for managing natural resources,
       assessing fire risk and for adopting mitigating strategies, for
       example.
       Thanks to Copernicus Sentinel-2’s ability to zoom in on our planet,
       researchers have discovered that there are more areas being
       affected by fire than previously thought.
       A paper published recently in Remote Sensing of the Environment
       describes how researchers used the high-resolution imaging
       capability of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission to produce the
       first detailed continental map of burns caused by wildfires.
       Sentinel-2 is a two-satellite constellation built for the EU’s
       Copernicus environmental monitoring programme. Each identical
       satellite carries a high-resolution multispectral imager. The
       mission has a myriad of uses, particularly related to monitoring
       the health of world’s vegetation and mapping how the surface of our
       land changes.
       The authors focused on sub-Saharan Africa as the region accounts
       for around 70% of burned area worldwide according to global
       satellite databases, making it the ideal testbed for evaluating the
       potential for improving the understanding of global impacts of
       fire.
       Copernicus Sentinel-2 reveals more fires than thought
       They found that 4.9 million sq km of land had been burned in 2016,
       which is 80% more than reported with information from
       coarser-resolution satellite sensors. These new-found areas
       comprised mainly burned areas smaller than 100 ha.
       Although usually not as catastrophic as large fires, small fires
       are linked to land-use change, particularly if they have been set
       to clear land for agriculture or grazing.
       Lead author, Ekhi Roteta from the University of the Basque Country,
       said, “This increase in the amount of burned area and the fact that
       it is made up of small areas came as no surprise as Copernicus
       Sentinel-2 has a resolution of 20 m, more than ten times the zoom
       of other satellite instruments.
       “The additional impact of these small fires may be underrepresented
       which suggests an increase in the contribution to greenhouse gas
       emissions. It would therefore be useful to include these data in
       existing climate models.
       “The next step would be to create a global map of burned areas at
       20 m resolution to reveal the evidence of more small fires, which
       in turn could lead to greater clarity on greenhouse gas emissions,
       land-cover change and land management.”
       The research and data product were developed in the framework of
       the Fire Disturbance project, part of ESA’s Climate Change
       Initiative. It involved processing 11 000 Copernicus Sentinel-2
       images. The product is named FireCCISFD11 and is publicly available
       from the CCI Open Data Portal. The project is also generating
       global burned area products from Copernicus Sentinel-3 sensors, as
       well as radar algorithms for detecting burned areas in cloudy
       regions.

World-first firing of air-breathing electric thruster
       Air-breathing ion thruster
       5 March 2018
       In a world-first, an ESA-led team has built and fired an electric
       thruster to ingest scarce air molecules from the top of the
       atmosphere for propellant, opening the way to satellites flying in
       very low orbits for years on end.
       ESA’s GOCE gravity-mapper flew as low as 250 km for more than four
       years thanks to an electric thruster that continuously compensated
       for air drag. However, its working life was limited by the 40 kg of
       xenon it carried as propellant – once that was exhausted, the
       mission was over.
       Replacing onboard propellant with atmospheric molecules would
       create a new class of satellites able to operate in very low orbits
       for long periods.
       Air-breathing space mission
       Air-breathing electric thrusters could also be used at the outer
       fringes of atmospheres of other planets, drawing on the carbon
       dioxide of Mars, for instance.
       “This project began with a novel design to scoop up air molecules
       as propellant from the top of Earth’s atmosphere at around 200 km
       altitude with a typical speed of 7.8 km/s,” explains ESA’s Louis
       Walpot.
       Test set-up
       A complete thruster was developed for testing the concept by Sitael
       in Italy, which was performed in a vacuum chamber in their test
       facilities, simulating the environment at 200 km altitude.
       A ‘particle flow generator’ provided the oncoming high-speed
       molecules for collection by the Ram-Electric Propulsion novel
       intake and thruster.
       There are no valves or complex parts – everything works on a
       simple, passive basis. All that is needed is power to the coils and
       electrodes, creating an extremely robust drag-compensation system.
       Air-breathing electric propulsion
       The challenge was to design a new type of intake to collect the air
       molecules so that instead of simply bouncing away they are
       collected and compressed.
       The molecules collected by the intake designed by QuinteScience in
       Poland are given electric charges so that they can be accelerated
       and ejected to provide thrust.
       Thruster inside vacuum chamber
       Sitael designed a dual-stage thruster to ensure better charging and
       acceleration of the incoming air, which is harder to achieve than
       in traditional electric propulsion designs.
       “The team ran computer simulations on particle behaviour to model
       all the different intake options,” adds Louis, “but it all came
       down to this practical test to know if the combined intake and
       thruster would work together or not.
       “Instead of simply measuring the resulting density at the collector
       to check the intake design, we decided to attach an electric
       thruster. In this way, we proved that we could indeed collect and
       compress the air molecules to a level where thruster ignition could
       take place, and measure the actual thrust.
       Thruster with xenon propellant
       “At first we checked our thruster could be ignited repeatedly with
       xenon gathered from the particle beam generator.”
       As a next step, Louis explains, the xenon was partially replaced by
       a nitrogen–oxygen air mixture: “When the xenon-based blue colour of
       the engine plume changed to purple, we knew we’d succeeded.
       “The system was finally ignited repeatedly solely with atmospheric
       propellant to prove the concept’s feasibility.
       Thruster with air
       “This result means air-breathing electric propulsion is no longer
       simply a theory but a tangible, working concept, ready to be
       developed, to serve one day as the basis of a new class of
       missions.”
       This project was backed through ESA’s Technology Research Programme
       for developing promising new ideas for space, with the support of
       the Agency's Earth Observation Programme.
