   Counselor Corner

Our Philosophy

   Elementary School Counseling services are an integral part of the total
   school program and complement learning in the classroom. A school
   guidance program reaches every student and will focus on the knowledge,
   skills, and attitudes needed for successful academic achievement,
   career development, and personal/social growth. Services are
   child-centered, proactive, and developmental. Our professional school
   counselors spend their time working directly with students to maximize
   the benefits every student will receive from the program. This will be
   accomplished through the use of School Counseling Curriculum,
   Individual Student Planning, Responsive Services, and System Support.
   School counseling services are comprehensive in scope, preventative in
   design, developmental in nature, and intended to enhance the potential
   of ALL elementary students.

   Therefore, as an educational system we believe we can teach all
   children and all children can learn. We believe accessing knowledge,
   reasoning, questioning, and problem solving are the foundations for
   learning in an ever-changing world. We believe education enables
   students to recognize and strive for higher standards. Consequently, we
   will commit our efforts to help students acquire knowledge and
   attitudes considered valuable in order to develop their potential
   and/or their career and lifetime aspirations.

Take What You Need

   I made this poster to put in our staff lounge this weekend and thought
   I'd share.  If I were a betting girl I would anticipate that "patience"
   will be the first to be taken!  Simply print and cut between the words
   on the bottom.

Great Joy

   If you're like me, you've been running around like crazy, trying to fit
   in all those great, sweet, fun holiday activities with your students
   and families alike. Food Drive, Angel Tree, Santa's Workshop... :0}
   somethings gotta give! Unfortunately, it's also a time that our
   struggling families' everyday issues become magnified, and cannot be
   put on hold. I came across a book I wanted to share with you, maybe it
   can help keep things in perspective for us and our kids. Check out the
   blog the link is from...I aspire to be as consistent as this blogger is
   with her site! Blessings, everyone!

Tricky People

   [netsmartzkids.jpg]
   http://www.netsmartzkids.org/LearnWithClicky/BeatTheTricks
   This week I'm teaching Internet Safety and came across this video
   teaching "Real World" smarts...great info presented in a
   non-threatening way for younger kids - K -2 . I haven't checked but I
   bet there's a color sheet to go with it. If you use it with your kids,
   share your feedback and any suggestions you might have!

Happy Friday!!

'In Your Shoes'  pragmatic language activity

   Found a great activity http://speechroomnews.blogspot.com
   The games are called 'In your shoes.' The download includes 3 games:
   Problem Solving 1 & 2 and Perspective Taking. They feature these cute
   shoe graphics from KPM doodles.
   Its available through TeachersPayTeachers...I didn't mind paying for it
   as it has great graphics I wouldn't be able to make! She mentions that
   it would be fun to use with an empathy lesson. I plan to use with the
   book called " How Do I Stand in Your Shoes?" by Susan DeBell (grade 2)

Divorce :(

   [home-image1.jpg]
   I don't know I'm surprised but again today I was touched by how
   difficult the impact of divorce is on kids, even after years of
   separation.
   Fortunately I've recently come across some great resources for kids
   dealing with on-going issues with regard to divorce.
   Check out www.kidsturn.org for information and free materials to help
   children better cope with the grief of parent separation and divorce.
   There is also information for parents.

   [selfcontrol.jpg]
   If you're interested in making your own posters, I'd recommend
   Vistaprint.  I recently received my first order for posters from them,
   and I'm pleased.  I decided I like the "small" size best (11.25" x
   17.3") and would suggest choosing the "premium poster cardstock"
   option for $1.99 extra. They are sturdy enough to tote around to
   classroom guidance lessons, and then post on your wall for continued
   reference.  One more suggestion: wait for a sale!  I got the "medium
   size" (24"x18") for $5.99 each a few weeks ago and they have a
   plastic-y front coating on them so lamination isn't necessary.  I'm
   hoping the coating will also minimize fading.  If you add photos to
   your design (costs a little more), there doesn't seem to be a
   resolution warning, so be careful.
   A few more from my order:
