What is Wine?

   Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a
   compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several
   POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead
   of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or
   emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls
   on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other
   methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into
   your desktop.

   Remembering Józef Kucia

   September 11, 2019
   [Józef-Kucia.png]

   With great sadness we are announcing the passing of our friend, Józef
   Kucia.

   Józef was a major Wine contributor with over 2500 patches since his
   first contribution in 2012. He was a highly talented programmer with a
   focus on Wine's Direct3D subsystem. Józef founded and led the vkd3d
   project and provided insight and guidance to the Vulkan working group.
   He also contributed to other open source projects including Mesa and
   Debian.

   Józef was a regular attendee at the yearly WineConf. A man of few
   words, he was helpful and displayed a quiet kindness.
   His skills attracted the interest of CodeWeavers and Józef joined their
   team in 2015. That allowed him to dedicate more of his time to Wine.

   Józef died last month at the young age of 30 in an accident in the
   Jaskinia Wielka Śnieżna ("great snowy cave") in the Tatra Mountains in
   Poland. Caving was his passion.

   Józef will be remembered with warm memories by those who worked with
   him. Our thoughts and condolences go out to Józef's family, friends,
   loved ones, and everyone else who grieves his passing.
