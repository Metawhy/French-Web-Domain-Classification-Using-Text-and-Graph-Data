Struggling with Sleep? Read this!

     * August 7, 2019

   Read more

   Let’s be honest, most of us aren’t getting the eight hours of sleep our
   doctors tells us to get each night. And even when we ARE getting eight
   hours…it may not be restful. As a society, we focus a lot of our
   attention as it relates to health on diet and exercise, but we often
   forget to count sleep as one of the most important aspects of our
   overall wellness.

Our New Smoothie Obsession!

     * July 23, 2019

   Read more

   Every single time I get together with a girlfriend and ask ‘how are
   you?!’ the first thing that typically comes out of her mouth is ‘I’m
   good. Busy. But good!’ I also say this far too often, but the truth
   is…we are all BUSY! We’re all trying to fit a thousand things into a 24
   hour period, and the rat race of the day can make it super challenging
   to take care of ourselves and eat well. Sometimes I’ll be heading out
   to a meeting, starving, but completely forgot to meal prep and
   well…enter the drive-thru window. It’s always a bad idea, I always feel
   gross after making poor meal decisions, but yet, so many of us do
   this.

My Summer Lipstick Favourites!

     * July 11, 2019

   Read more

   I‘ve been getting many questions lately on Instagram about my
   lipstick…and for those who are always trying to find the perfect
   shades, let me tell you; I’m right there with you! I find it tricky to
   find the ideal colour, scent (because lipstick scent totally matters),
   and gloss factor (I’m not a huge glossy lipstick person).

Homemade Frozen Banana Pops

     * June 20, 2019

   Read more

   I‘ve been making these banana pops for roughly two months now, and the
   girls LOVE them! They are full of potassium and antioxidants, but they
   truly do taste like a treat (I love them too)! Don’t worry mamas’ –
   these are super easy to make and I can usually whip up a batch in about
   15 minutes! You can switch up the toppings depending on your flavour
   preference; we always use a variety of toppings like coconut flakes,
   chopped peanuts, peanut butter, skor pieces, sprinkles, and more!

An Outdoor Inspired Father’s Day Party

     * June 4, 2019

   Read more

   I‘m super excited to share this Father’s Day tablescape with you
   because I typically don’t show a more masculine inspired way of
   entertaining. Those who read my blog know that I love that floral,
   airy, feminine style…but, sometimes you’ve got to mix it up and
   Father’s Day is the perfect opportunity to try something different!
