   I wasn't going to publish I reading list this year... gasp!... I know
   how could I say such a thing! I've honestly just been feeling kind of
   hit-or-miss with reading lately (it happens to all of us!) But then I
   remembered that I do SO much better reading when I have a list to help
   me feel pumped & encouraged... and I thought... why not?!
   So here it is! 25 categories for books for 2018...
   [2018%2BReading%2BList.png]
   (pin this! you'll thank me later)
   Now, you're probably  thinking... it seems like there's a lot of
   non-fiction categories on here. Well, yes and no. There is something
   about the new year that gets me on a non-fiction kick, so that's where
   my mind's at currently, BUT you can totally use those categories for
   novels or memoirs as well!
   For example, a fiction idea for the category "A book to make you a
   better person" you could read
   Wonder by RJ Palacio  (read this!!)
   You can also download this version of the list (if you prefer) for easy
   printing.
   (Just save the image on your computer and print from there)

   That's it for now! Happy reading!

   As moms we are always bombarded by information and advice about our
   kids. With judgement from others, worrying about "fitting in" and
   following the latest trends, as well as the general
   "interconnected-ness" of our lives we can be pointed in so many
   different directions.
   That's why I loved this book.
   The biggest thing I took away from it is that there are very
   few right answers. Every child is different, every mother is different,
   and every family is different. We all have different challenges and
   strengths, and the varying combinations of those in or lives can help
   us pick the best things to do for our families.
   That's the key... the best thing for YOUR FAMILY.
   You can't pick the best thing for me, and I can't pick the best thing
   for you.
   From Grandma to You exemplified that idea. This is a book of advice
   from moms and grandmothers who have BEEN THERE. They've done it before!
   The teething, the potty-training, the illnesses, all of it. They've
   been-there-done-that, and this book shares their advice from grandmas
   of all backgrounds.
   [IMG_6519.JPG]
   And you know what... not all their advice is the same! Yet they all
   went through similar stages with their kids and grandkids. The reason
   there's no "user manual" that all children come with, is because even
   though children primarily go through similar stages of growth, their
   experiences are rarely the same. Even two kids in the same family can
   have vastly different experiences and challenges. Kids are different,
   parents are different, and I love that this book gave so many different
   pieces of advice that moms can use to find what works for them and for
   their kids.
   I'm a believer that you can never learn to much or hear to many good
   ideas. The trick is taking all  those ideas and not getting caught up
   when one doesn't work; just try the next one! Find what works best for
   YOU, and do it.
   [IMG_6515.JPG]
   And now a little bit more about From Grandma to You: Childcare Wisdom
   for a New Generation 2nd Edition.
   (now available on Amazon: HERE)
   It's divided in chapters to help organize the advice, and each section
   has suggestions from a variety of grandmas as well as Dr. Rich, a
   pediatrician. The chapters include: enjoying motherhood, eating,
   pacifiers, tips & tricks, sleep, crying, discipline, and home
   remedies.
   A couple favorite parts:
   In the chapter on discipline a grandmother told the story of how her
   grandfather would flip a spoonful of water at the offender to get their
   attention and get them to stop whatever undesirable thing they were
   doing. She said it "was especially handy for cooling off an argument
   before it got to heated." She remembered how Grandpa was so sly that
   they rarely even saw him dip the spoon in a cup of water before water
   was shooting across the room at their face! "[They] knew it was half in
   fun, but [they] also knew he meant it."
   Another section talks about how sometimes we give our children too many
   choices before they're ready. Instead, one grandmother suggests giving
   two or three options and letting the child pick between those. For
   example, pulling out two outfits from the closet and letting our child
   pick from those two instead of putting the whole wardrobe up for grabs.
   "Let your child choose between two right options as you start to teach
   them about making correct choices."
   [IMG_6520.JPG]
   Things My Mom Did:
   I got a little chuckle as one grandmother recounted how she used to
   dress her six boys alike in brightly colored shirts when they were in
   busy places so she could count them easily. My mom did the same thing!
   You could easily spot all 5 of my siblings and I dressed in bright
   yellow shirts and jean overalls at the zoo!
   This book also mentioned the Alphabet game we used to play in the car
   on road trips (you know, before ipads). We would start with A and try
   to find the letter A somewhere along the road (like on a road sign),
   then move on to B etc. I remember loving this game as a kid, and it
   kept the six of us quite entertained in the back of the mini van on our
   family vacations...that is until we got to X, Y, and Z and got
   frustrated that they were seemingly impossible to find!
   Other favorite snippets:
   "Grandchildren need grandmothers, even if they're far apart."
   "Use time spent feeding your baby to do something you enjoy."
   "Each child is unique and wonderful and deserves our unconditional
   love, immense patience, and very best efforts."
   "If your baby's crying is driving you crazy, put the baby in a safe
   place and leave the room or pass him to someone else. Crying never hurt
   a baby, but frustrated adults have."
   "Loving, supportive grandmothers and other mothers can provide
   invaluable help to new mothers during tough times--just ask them."
   [IMG_6518.JPG]
   Things I need to remember:
   "Learn to be patient with yourself -frustrating, difficult, or even
   scary experiences happen to everyone."
   "Don't wish the miracles of childhood away-- appreciate moments every
   day."
   "Guilt is a choice-- a feeling, and is totally worthless to either
   mother or child."
   "It's the mother's worrying, not the children, that's the biggest
   problem."
   Word of caution:
   In the traveling section of the book, Dr. Rich suggested giving
   Benadryl to kids before you travel. Don't get me wrong, for some kids
   that works great! But make sure your child is old enough AND do a test
   run at home...Otherwise you might end up like my mother-in-law... On a
   trip with my husband when he was a young child, she did what she had
   been suggested and gave him Benadryl to try to subdue him a bit as they
   traveled. Unfortunately, Benadryl had the opposite effect on him and he
   ended up bouncing off the walls the whole trip!
   Going along with the example above, my least favorite part of this book
   was the advice from Dr. Rich. It wasn't that it was necessarily bad
   advice, it was just the least valuable part in the book- in my opinion.
   I found most of his advice be a bit outdated and not what a
   pediatrician would suggest in 2017. That being said, he did work as a
   pediatrician for over 50 years, and had over 300,000 office calls, so
   his advice definitely isn't all bad! I would just suggest finding a
   pediatrician for your child that you trust and that stays up to date on
   current findings, and use him/her as a helpful guide in deciding what's
   best for your child. The doctors our daughter sees have been so helpful
   at educating us, as well as answering our questions when I do my own
   research. We have so much information available to us, use it wisely,
   do your research, find doctors you trust, and do what's best for
   your children.
   [IMG_6517.JPG]
   Overall, this book was so positive and uplifting! I loved how it helped
   me feel like I'm doing a good job as a mother, while still giving me a
   few pointers of things I can work on and try. It didn't make me feel
   overwhelmed or like I wasn't "good enough" like a lot of parenting
   books tend to make me feel.
   This book helped me feel stronger in the idea that if I'm doing what
   works for my kids and myself and that really is what's best!
   [FullSizeRender.jpg]
   In short... MOMS this book is for you! And GRANDMAS, you're the ones
   who need to buy it for them :)
   This book is perfect for new moms, young moms, or any mom that might
   just need a little encouragement that they're on the right track. It
   would be a perfect addition to a baby shower gift or would make an
   excellent Mother's Day or Christmas gift on it's own.

PRINTABLES:

   To help make gifting this book easier, I've created a handy little
   printable that YOU can add your own advice to and give it along with
   the gift.
     [tips%2Bfor%2Bmom.jpg]
   I also created a version if you'd like to have a little more freedom
   with the advice you give ;)
   It's a blank slate for  you to write what you feel is most important.
   [tips%2Bfor%2Bmom%2B%25281%2529.png]
   And here's versions of both for if you're not a Grandma :)
   [tips%2Bfor%2Bmom.png]
   [tips%2Bfor%2Bmom%2B%25281%2529.jpg]
   When you read this book, my wish is that you'll get as much out of it
   as I have. And that it reminds you that you're doing a good job and
   that YOU'RE A GREAT MOM!
   And I hope that when you gift this book that you do so with love and
   make sure your support and help comes right along with it. Like this
   book says "A grandma is a little bit parent, a little bit teacher, and
   a little bit best friend." And frankly, as moms we need all the help we
   can get ;)

   One evening while my husband was out of town, I was inspired by
   this instagram photo...

   A post shared by Sarah Taviani 🇦🇺 Brisbane, AUS (@commasandampersands)
   on Mar 8, 2017 at 12:45pm PST

    after I saw this I knew I just had to have a Mini Mandrake for my
   bookshelf! Within minutes I had managed to get my two-year-old in the
   car, and was off to track down the supplies!
   I ended up finding everything either at my local $1 store, or at the
   craft store down the street. And in that one outing I had everything I
   needed.
   [IMG_3496.JPG]
   It was SO easy to make, that I wanted to share it with you, so you too
   can have a MINI MANDRAKE on display next to your shelf of Harry Potter
   Books!
    *this post has affiliate links
   [IMG_3489.JPG]
   Here's what you need to make your Mini Mandrake:
   Small clay pot
   Foam (floral or regular will work)
   Floral Moss (like this)
   Faux Floral Greenery (this one or this one would look great!)
   Mandrake Printable (from HERE)
   Crayola Air Dry Clay (this is what I used)
   Modge Podge & brush
   Toothpicks

Step 1:

   [IMG_3488.JPG]
   Print your Mandrake Label (I found mine free here), and use modge podge
   to attach it to your small clay pot. Let dry.
   [IMG_3487.JPG]

Step 2:

   [IMG_3486.JPG]
   Cut your foam to fill most of your pot (I left a little less than 1inch
   at the top).

Step 3:

   [IMG_3485.JPG]
   Shape your clay into a Mandrake shape. Stick toothpicks in the bottom.
   [IMG_3484.JPG]
   Then use those toothpicks to anchor your mandrake in the foam in your
   pot.
   [IMG_3483.JPG]
   Make sure the front of your Mandrake is facing the front of your pot
   (where you put the label).

Step 4:

   [IMG_3482.JPG]
   Use your fingers to poke a hole in the top of your Mandrake.
   [IMG_3481.JPG]
   Then cut some faux floral greenery off the branch & cut down to size to
   fit your Mandrake.
   [IMG_3494.JPG]
   Carefully stick the greenery in the hole on the top of the Mandrake.
   Shape the clay around the greenery to hold it in place (or you could
   use glue).
   [IMG_3491.JPG]

Step 5:

   [IMG_3492.JPG]
   Re-shape your Mandrake form as needed (sometimes adding the greenery
   can cause dents you don't want in your Mandrake). Then use a toothpick
   to carve eyes, a mouth, and some wrinkles for your Mandrake.

Step 6:

   [IMG_3493.JPG]
   Fill in around your Mandrake with the floral moss. Make sure to cover
   any gaps so you can't see the foam.
   [IMG_3490.JPG]
   And you're DONE!!! Now you have an adorable MINI MANDRAKE! (Wasn't that
   easy?!)
