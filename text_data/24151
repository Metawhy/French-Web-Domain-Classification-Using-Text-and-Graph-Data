Parcels
Debut Album

   Our first album had to be self produced and it had to be the truest
   representation of us, as people, as musicians and as a group that we
   had ever offered before. Parcels started for us as a new
   experimentation in sound and image but after the five of us moved
   across the world together, its initial ideas and boundaries quickly
   lost importance. We had always played in bands together but clearly
   this was our first real band in that it was inseparable from the
   experience we were living together. This was now our identity, we’re a
   band in the older sense of the word. This suddenly gave direction to
   the initial recordings for our album and gave the thread we needed to
   push forward. The album is titled Parcels, because we believe we
   succeeded in tracking the truest possible representation of us right
   now, as people, as musicians and as a group.

Lyrics

Bemyself

   I know that I can't be a few,
   I'll be myself
   I'm told to be over the moon,
   I can teach myself
   But I'm old, I can feel that it's true
   I believe myself
   And I know it'll be over soon,
   I can see myself

   See myself

   I'm trapped, I am trapped in the boot
   I can't free myself
   And I'll talk, but you know there's no use
   I can't hear myself
   The road's blocked, I can tell that we've stopped
   I will lead myself
   And I know if I'm moving or not
   I will be myself

   Be myself.

Closetowhy

   All that waiting for a call, It arrived,
   and I know that place seems kind of close

   But I can't sleep,
   I can't seem to find waking peace of mind.

   The fight of the evening
   holds me close to why
   I might never sleep at all,
   even though I can't seem to find waking peace of mind.

   Some might say my life's a walk in the light,
   and though I'd say the same, I don't
   Cause all that space inside the walls, it's alive,
   and all night shaking my resolve

   So I can't sleep,
   I can't seem to find waking peace of mind.

Comedown

   No, no, no, no, no
   When it all comes down
   When it falls you can finda way out
   When it all hits the ground
   Come down
   When it's gone you can cry,
   let it go and try
   When it all comes down
   Come down

Everyroad

   All of the ghosts, people you love,
   even your friends don't want to know,
   but you can depend on every note
   over the end of every road.

Exotica

   Your look
   How it draws me in, a line I could never leave
   Your eyes
   Now I meet with them, it's all that I'll ever see
   Your love
   How I breath in it, it's all I would ever need
   I believe in it,
   It's all I could ever need.

   Oh mon amour, when you walk out the door I'm more lost than before

   And every night is another
   Every night is another war
   Lying alone but I love ya
   I'll never rewind what I never

   Above
   How I see it is. You will get a hold of it
   The height
   Heavens you design, in time you'll do everything
   Goodbye
   What I hear of it while I'm over on the other wing
   While I'm over on the other wing.

   Oh mon amour, when you walk out the door I'm more lost than before

   And every night is another
   Every night is another war
   Lying alone but I love ya
   I'll never rewind what I never saw.

   Every night is another

Iknowhowifeel

   I know how I feel right now
   I know how I feel now

   I know how I feel but
   there's a place I need to go,
   over the end of every road,
   where I can feel it on my own.

   I know how I feel but
   where the race is all I know,
   only the evening, let me go
   where I can feel it on my own.

   I know how you feel right now
   I know how you feel now

Lightenup

   Time to lighten up?
   I don't plan to
   Time I gave enough?
   I don't plan to

   Every eye is on us
   Every side is on us
   "Sing it with pride and promise, never cry
   Never cry, but you know we like it honest,
   you know that's why we bought you.
   I like your style and all,
   but do it right.
   Do it in time."

   To lighten up?
   I don't plan to
   Time I gave enough?
   I don't plan to

   I need it, I love it.
   The music, the time it takes for the letter to write back.
   Let it go
   Let it go, cause this is the final product
   Drink it a while and call us
   Sell it for dimes and dollars
   There you go.

Tape

   I lost my touch and I thought it was you
   I lost my way cutting corners, faulty truth
   So I went on my way to recapture what you took,
   and I came back with tape.
   Dare I leave it? Dare I look?

   No way I can go wrong
   It's all there
   I know the end
   There's no way out so so long
   Oh man, not again

   Do I retain yet a feeling over you?
   And should I explain to the teacher? To my muse?
   So I can get a break from the preacher, from a few
   So I'll go on and take what I need here, wouldn't you?

Tieduprightnow

   As I look out you're warning me,
   your thoughts devour my point of view
   (Give you up now)
   It’s true I cower when I will speak,
   so let's get round to why

   I will be the first in line to open up,
   so I don't mind to give you up.

   So let’s get round to why,
   The one I need is tied up right now
   So let’s just wait a while,
   The one I need is tied up right now
   So let’s not draw the line,
   Cause I can't make my mind up right now
   So let’s just wait a while,
   The one I need is tied up right

   I will be the first in line to open up so I don't mind
   I will be the first in line to open up,
   so I don't mind to give you up.

   So let’s get round to why,
   The one I need is tied up right now
   So let’s just wait a while,
   The one I need is tied up right now
   So let’s not draw the line,
   Cause I can't make my mind up right now

   So let’s just wait a while,
   The one I need is tied up right

   Its unintended but all in vein
   It’s what I found on my side
   You knew I'd pass through it’s all the same,
   So let’s get down to why

   The one I need is tied up right now
   So let’s just wait a while,
   The one I need is tied up, right?

Withorwithout

   You were the world calling out my own name
   You were the girl I fell beneath every day
   You were the birds talking in my dream
   You were the world I wish I'd never seen.

   You were the line, drawn in every way
   You were divine, even though I'd say
   you were the start of something I don't need
   You were the world I wish I'd never seen.

   With or without you?
   Better without you.

   Said I was more than a man in your way
   Said I was yours till the end of the day
   There was a time when I would have been
   over the moon sinking on my knees.

   You were the world calling out my own name
   You were the girl I fell beneath every day
   You were the birds talking in my dream
   You were the world I wish I'd never seen.

Yourfault

   I
   I built a wall, I built it up when I was young
   I didn't know, how could I know I built it up?

   It's all gone
   The family has moved on and I don't know if it's your fault or my fault
   It's all gone
   I know it now that I did wrong, but I don't know if it's your fault or
   my fault.

   You
   You took a loan, you bought a house and built it up
   I'm sure you know I felt alone. I couldn't stop

   It's all gone
   The family has moved on and I don't know if it's your fault or my fault
   It's all gone
   I know it now that I did wrong, but I don't know if it's your fault or
   my fault

   It's your fault.
