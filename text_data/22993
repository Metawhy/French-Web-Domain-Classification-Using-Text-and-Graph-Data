Welcome to The Cat House on the Kings

Our Mission

   The Cat House on the Kings is California's largest no-cage, no-kill,
   lifetime cat sanctuary and adoption center. Our mission is to place
   rescued cats and kittens into loving, permanent homes; to provide a
   safe, happy and healthy home for unwanted cats and kittens in a unique,
   no-cage facility; to prevent pet overpopulation through spaying and
   neutering; and to educate the public about responsible pet ownership.

In a Nutshell

   Lynea Lattanzio, who founded and runs The Cat House on the Kings, talks
   about how it came about and gives you a peek into our unique
   environment in these videos by Jack Perez and Chris Poole:

   The Cat House is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, receives no
   government or public funding, and relies entirely on donations from the
   public to carry out its mission.

   Since its founding 27 years ago, The Cat House on the Kings has saved
   over 30,000 cats and 7,100 dogs (not counting the 56,000 animals we
   have spayed and neutered!) and currently cares for more than 700 cats
   and kittens, a dozen or so dogs and dozens of peacocks.
