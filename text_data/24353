     Winter sleeps now.
     Our season of renewal awakens.
     Let us prepare for birth and sacrifice.
     Let us learn and share.
     Let us love and take care.
     Let us follow the path and mind how we go.
     From the Spring festival proclamation for Stonefield Parish, 1971
          + As usual, excellent.
