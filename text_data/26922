Trump's Transphobic Moves Will Cause Global Harm

   Amnesty International TKTK

   The trans erasure memo and similar actions by the administration will
   reverberate beyond the U.S., says Amnesty International.

   The Trump administration’s reported effort to define transgender people
   out of existence is a tool of horrific violence, and its implications
   endanger people here in the United States as well as around the world.
   This transphobic and wrongheaded move puts the U.S. out of step with
   international law and basic human rights. It’s a dehumanizing measure
   that recalls some of the most shameful chapters of our history,
   including the subjugation of Indigenous peoples and chattel slavery,
   and we should be deeply alarmed.

   The news of Donald Trump’s latest anti-LGBTI extremism flies in the
   face of global human rights progress for LGBTI people, coming mere days
   after Uruguay passed a law granting rights to transgender people,
   prohibiting discrimination under current laws and ensuring they can
   access the health care they need.  Across the world, Australia recently
   became the 27th country to legalize same-sex marriage. And this
   September, India’s highest court struck down colonial-era antisodomy
   laws.

   But there are other places in the world where LGBTI people fight for
   their existence on the most fundamental of levels, and people in these
   regions are at increased risk if the Trump administration’s bigotry
   becomes policy. Some hurdles are grave, like Uganda’s efforts to impose
   the death penalty for the “crime” of homosexuality and Finland’s
   invasive requirement that someone be declared to have a “mental
   disorder” and be sterilized to have their gender officially reassigned.
   If Trump gets his way, it will further embolden transphobic and
   homophobic movements and governments everywhere.

   The Trump administration has made no effort to hide its admiration for
   oppressive regimes in Turkey, Russia, and Saudi Arabia that are
   especially toxic for LGBTI people. We have seen Trump’s disdain for
   freedom of expression and human rights echoed in these governments’
   policies toward civil society. There is no reason to expect that
   Trump’s efforts to erase transgender people won’t also have horrific
   consequences abroad.

   Any move to define sex as that “set at birth” and gender as immutable
   is not only meant to severely curtail transgender people's rights and
   erase their identity here at home; it is a move to impinge on the basic
   humanity and dignity of people everywhere. The Trump administration is
   demanding the sole right to define sex and gender — characteristics it
   insists are immutable. This defies scientific and medical definitions
   as well as basic human rights. For some, the “sex” they are assigned at
   birth does not fit with their gender identity. What’s more, it negates
   the rights of intersex people — an estimated 1.7 percent of the
   population — who are born with sex characteristics that exist outside
   of narrow definitions of “female” or “male” sex.

   This administration seems to be fixated on rolling back LGBTI rights,
   particularly rights for transgender people. From rolling back
   protections for trans students to seeking to implement a ban on trans
   troops in the military to promoting legal discrimination against trans
   people in the workplace, this latest attempt is part of a long line of
   policies that seek to deny basic rights to trans people, this time by
   simply erasing them from existence in the eyes of the government.

   Everyone has the right to freedom from violence and discrimination, the
   right to health care, the right to marry and to have a family. These
   are rights the Trump administration has consistently stood against for
   LGBTI people, with global effects. Any move to simply erase people is a
   move away from human rights, and it implicates us all.
