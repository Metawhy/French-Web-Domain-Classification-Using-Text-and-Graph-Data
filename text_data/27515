   From songwriters to artists and super-fans to superstars, electronic
   dance music’s first sisters – Mim and Liv Nervo of NERVO – have staged
   a miraculous climb onto the international stage, straight from the pit
   in front of it.

   These multi talented DJ dynamos are the all-time top-ranking female DJs
   in the world, voted by their legions of fans to No. 16 on DJ Magazine’s
   influential “Top 100 DJs” poll while continuing to rank as the top
   female DJ’s. In-demand and beloved across the globe, their nonstop
   schedule takes them from the shimmering beaches of Ibiza, to their
   studio in their home-away-from-hometowns of London and LA, to the
   towering Main Stages of the biggest festivals in the world including
   Tomorrowland, Lollapalooza, Creamfields, Balaton Sound, EDC, Electric
   Zoo, ULTRA and many more. Everywhere they go, their infectious energy,
   fearless personal style, and deep love and understanding for the music
   precedes them.

   Mim and Liv’s career caught fire in 2009, when they co-wrote the the
   emphatic and grand global hit “When Love Takes Over” – for David Guetta
   and Kelly Rowland. But their journey into dance music started years
   prior in the festival fields of their native Australia, when as
   teenagers they went all-out for life-changing electronic acts like The
   Prodigy, Basement Jaxx, and Fatboy Slim.

   “Purple hair and purple lipstick; we did it all,” says Mim. “We almost
   broke ribs being in the front row of the mosh pit. We were those people
   in the crowd for so many years, to be playing on the same bills with
   some of those artists now is just electrifying.”

   Having cemented their songwriting prowess with a global No. 1 (plus
   several other songs for artists like Ke$ha, Kylie Minogue and Armin Van
   Buuren), NERVO set out to pursue their own career as artists, quite
   literally writing their own songs under their own name. Their friends
   and collaborators in the world showed up to support them. “We’re All No
   One” with Afrojack and Steve Aoki (No. 8 on the Billboard Hot Dance
   Club Songs chart),”The Way We See The World” with Afrojack, Dimitri
   Vegas and Like Mike (the official anthem of Tomorrowland 2011, which
   has garnered over 45 million YouTube views), “Reason” with Hook N
   Sling, “Something to Believe In” with Norman Doray, “Like Home” with
   Nicky Romero (their first No. 1 topping the Beatport chart for 3
   weeks), “Turn This Love Around” with Armin Van Buuren (off the No. 1
   DJ’s new album Intense): Their list of A-list collaborators is dance
   music’s longest and most enviable, and in a world dominated by bros,
   that’s one heck of a sister act. They can do it for themselves too:
   NERVO original “You’re Gonna Love Again” has over 17 million views and
   their 2013 single “Hold On” (#1 on the Billboard Club Play chart) has
   garnered 11 million views.  Other releases included “Not Taking This No
   More” (#1 on the Beatport Electro House chart). Their single titled
   “Revolution”, a collaboration with R3hab and Ummet Ozcan, was released
   on Nov 11th via Spinnin Records and has spent 3 weeks at #1 on
   Beatport.


   “Normally we open our DJ sets with one of our own records, and the
   second that happens and you see the hands go up, it’s game on,” says
   Liv. “We’ve worked so hard in our industry behind the scenes, to step
   out and be releasing records in our own name is a whole different
   energy, a whole different world. It really is addictive and so
   rewarding”

   Fortunately the girls can get a regular fix during their residencies
   and headlining sets at some of the top venues and events in the world
   including the new Las Vegas mega-clubs Omnia, Hakkasan, and Wet
   Republic, and Ibiza Beach Clubs Ushuaia and Hï (home to
   their #NERVONation parties). NERVO are also regularly embarking on
   Headlining tours of their own in Mexico, Europe, India, Australia and
   beyond! Wherever it may be the sisters are always playing to their
   devoted fans who wear homemade NERVO t shirts and hoist signs (“Will
   you marry me?”; “Lesbians for NERVO”), curve their hands into heart
   shapes, and post photos and poems to show their love and appreciation.
   NERVO has seen rapid growth across their social media channels
   including 1.2 million Instagram followers, 1.1 million Twitter
   followers, 3.7 million likes on Facebook, 338K subscribers on YouTube,
   1.7 million monthly followers on Spotify, and 610K followers on
   Soundcloud.

   Style, savvy, positivity and talent: It’s no wonder that NERVO was
   invited to join the ranks of the legendary beauties who can call
   themselves CoverGirls, named to the iconic CoverGirl brand’s family of
   spokeswomen last year. The partnership is just one more fabulous
   chapter in the developing NERVO story, a tale told in sweat, smiles,
   nail polish, neon, and no small amount of pixie dust.  Along this brand
   partnerships have included Tag Heuer, Coach, Ballantine’s, Smirinoff,
   MOET, Smart Car, Pepsi, SABMiller, Burn and Monster Energy Drinks,
   Corona, Pioneer, and many, many more.

   “Let’s face it, you can be creative in many ways,” says Mim. “From
   wearing crazy clothes and great makeup to playing insane tunes. It’s
   all good.”

   NERVO are regularly featured in Vogue, Elle, Cosmopolitan, NYLON, In
   Style, People and other fashion/pop culture publications around the
   globe. In August 2013 NERVO performed live from the red carpet at the
   MTV Video Music Awards and in November they will appear on BRAVO TV as
   guest judges on the Rihanna produced reality show ‘Styled To Rock’.

   This summer NERVO released “Not Taking This No More” (#1 on the
   Beatport Electro House chart). Their new single titled “Revolution”, a
   collaboration with R3hab and Ummet Ozcan, was released on Nov 11th via
   Spinnin Records and has spent 3 weeks at #1 on Beatport.

   Most recently NERVO has released the viral hit “Best Friend” which has
   become the official iPhone X campaign launch song, reached #1 on radio
   and iTunes, has over 15 million views on YouTube and over 30 million
   streams on Spotify.  Also gaining traction this past year including the
   hits “In Your Arms”, “Anywhere You Go”, “LOCO”, “Like Air”, “Make It
   Last”, “Champagne” and “Lost In You” featuring some of the biggest
   Artist in dance music today including Timmy Trumpet, Quintino, Danny
   Avila, DVBBS, Chief Keef, and Wolfpack.
