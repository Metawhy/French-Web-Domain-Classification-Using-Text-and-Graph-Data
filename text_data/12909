   Analysis: new research finds that birds may fail to adapt fast enough
   to climate change thus increasing the odds of local extinction

   Around the turn of the 21st century, frog species started to disappear
   mysteriously from cloud forests across Central and South America. The
   immediate finger was pointed towards a spreading fungal skin disease,
   but closer inspection revealed that warming local temperatures were
   making life easier for the fungus, spelling trouble for the frogs. As
   the lead researcher of the study, Alan Pounds, put it at the time,
   "disease is the bullet killing frogs, but climate change is pulling the
   trigger".

   The frog study exemplifies the so-called attribution problem in climate
   change research: if a species goes extinct at the same time as climate
   is changing, can we pin the former on the latter? If an extreme heat
   wave occurs, can we attribute the event itself to climate change?

   The problem is that many co-occurring phenomena could be the reason
   behind a given event and pure chance also comes in. We cannot easily
   (or ethically!) do experiments where we manipulate just the climate
   while keeping everything else constant, and then see what happens.

   frog

   But one thing we can say for sure is that climate change is loading the
   dice, such that extreme heatwaves and species extinctions are becoming
   much more probable. If an athlete takes steroids and wins a race, did
   the steroids make them win it? We can never say for sure, as the
   athlete may have simply been in good form on the day, but clearly
   athletes on steroids will tend to win more races than clean athletes,
   all else being equal.

   Which brings us to the birds. In a new study led by the ecologist
   Viktoriia Radchuk, which brought together a large team of international
   collaborators (myself included), data were collated from scores of
   long-term population studies of many different animal species, the
   majority of which were birds. The goal was to test for general patterns
   in how species are adapting to climate change, and four main findings
   emerged.

   Firstly, animal species in temperate regions of the world are on
   average advancing their phenology, i.e. the timing of important life
   cycle events like breeding and migration, as their environments warm
   up. Secondly, these responses are a good thing in that they allow
   populations to partially track changing seasonal patterns wrought by
   global warming. For example, breeding earlier when temperatures rise
   can allow birds to remain in synchrony with an advancing seasonal peak
   in food supply (e.g. insects that are abundant for only a short window
   in summer). However, these behavioural adjustments are not always
   perfect and the birds may shift at a slower rate than their prey,
   limiting the number of young that can be successfully raised each year.

   From RTÉ Radio 1's Countrywide, farmers, consumers and experts discuss
   how we can protect the environment, wildlife, farm incomes and the food
   supply in the climate emergency

   Indeed, our third result was that, on average, these populations are
   experiencing natural selection to breed or migrate earlier. This is
   essentially a Darwinian process, whereby the early bird not only
   catches the worm, but also produces more chicks who in turn survive
   better. If breeding time has a genetic basis, then early birds pass on
   their genes for early-breeding at a faster rate than late birds pass on
   their late-breeding genes. The population as a whole thereby undergoes
   adaptation.

   This then led to an obvious question: can these populations adapt fast
   enough to cope with future climate change? This question, of course,
   can only be addressed by some sort of modelling, just as meteorologists
   cannot tell you with 100% certainty whether it will rain tomorrow.
   Rather, they give you a forecast – essentially an educated guess,
   backed up with tried-and-tested mathematical models of how weather
   works.

   In our case, we used an evolutionary model that compared the observed
   climate change response of the population in question against a gold
   standard, "theoretically perfect response". Although it can sometimes
   proceed rapidly, Darwinian evolution is not without limits, especially
   if the climate changes too rapidly.

   From RTÉ Radio 1's Mooney Goes Wild, a discussion on he subtleties of
   bird song

   This led to our fourth and final finding. Across the 13 species for
   which we had sufficient data, the model forecasted that future changes
   in phenology will likely not be enough for these populations to cope
   with future warming. In other words, they may fail to adapt fast enough
   to the accelerating climate change that is coming down the tracks,
   increasing the odds of local extinction.

   Technically, the term extinction means that the whole species dies out
   everywhere it was formerly found. Our study was focussed on single
   study populations in given places, e.g. a woodland where the local
   Great Tits or Blue Tits are monitored in nest-boxes provided by the
   researchers. As species, however, Great Tits and Blue Tits are found
   across most of Europe and into Asia and North Africa; thus the loss of
   local populations does not mean the loss of the entire species.

   If populations cannot adapt to changing climate in their current
   locations, the species as a whole may still be able to avoid global
   extinction through a process known as "range shifting". The range
   refers to the total geographic area where a given species is found, and
   the shifting part means that the range itself moves, as some
   populations slowly fade out (e.g. in the hottest regions) and new
   populations are established elsewhere where the climate is more
   suitable (e.g. at cooler latitudes or altitudes).

   art=false

   underway

   Of course, if everywhere warms up rapidly, and this continues unabated,
   the species may be unable to move quickly enough to stay in the game,
   or it could run out of suitable places or be geographically trapped by
   barriers to dispersal (e.g. species found only on remote islands or
   mountaintops). And here is where the major concern arises: our planet
   as a whole is currently warming faster than at any time in the past
   10,000 years, and some climate models are predicting that warming over
   the coming century may be 10 times faster than anything seen since the
   time the dinosaurs went extinct, some 65 million years ago.

   A particularly important study in 2004 examined potential future range
   shifts in over 1,000 species of plants and animals and reached a rather
   stark conclusion. It found that 15 to 37% of species (across the
   regions and taxa examined) will be "committed to extinction" by 2050
   under a mid-range climate warming scenario. The study did not account
   for local populations potentially adapting their behaviours and traits
   in their current locations, but it nonetheless served as an
   important warning of what could happen if warming continues unabated.

   By contrast, our model-based forecasts focussed purely on adaptive
   changes occurring within a given place, so the findings are not easily
   scaled-up to the entire geographic range of the species. The challenge
   for future studies is to build better models that account for both of
   these aspects. In other words, we must forecast, under different
   climate scenarios, likely changes both in where species may be found in
   the future, and in the physical and behavioural characteristics of
   local populations, which together will influence global extinction risk
   in a warming world.

   From RTÉ Radio 1's Mooney Goes Wild, Grahame Madge from the Royal
   Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) on how migratory birds are
   on the brink of extinction In Britain

   What about Ireland's birds? Will climate change drive them extinct?
   Should the Irish climate become increasingly unsuitable for some
   species, then the chances are that these species will no longer be
   found here in the future, either as breeding birds, overwintering
   birds, or passage migrants. At the same time, other species from warmer
   parts of Europe may find the new Irish climate increasingly attractive,
   such that local losses are balanced to some extent by gains.

   There is some evidence that such changes in our avifauna are already
   occurring. For example, recent declines in the numbers of wintering
   waterbirds in Ireland could in part reflect shifts in migratory
   behaviour, where warming at higher latitudes means that some species no
   longer have to travel all the way to Ireland to find snow/ice-free
   conditions. Recent new arrivals to our shores such as the Little Egret
   have also been speculatively linked with climate change.

   Other factors may also be at play and it is not unheard of for birds to
   suddenly expand their ranges. For example, the ubiquitous Collared Dove
   first graced our shores only in 1959, as part of a rapid 20th century
   range expansion from Asia to Western Europe. None of our bird species
   are endemic to Ireland, meaning they are also found in other places in
   the world, although we do have a few endemic subspecies (e.g.
   White-throated Dipper, Coal Tit, Eurasian Jay, Red Grouse) – local
   flavours on a wider theme. Thus, the loss of a given species from
   Ireland, while tragic, may not be accompanied by the loss of that
   species from the whole planet, although clearly the loss of unique
   subspecies would be a much bigger hit.

   RTÉ Brainstorm podcast on the species at risk of extinction in Ireland

   Just like the doping athlete about to enter a race, we cannot say for
   sure that species A or B will definitely go locally or globally extinct
   because of climate change -- no-one can, bar the odd gifted soothsayer.
   But we can conclude that many species will struggle to adapt or move
   fast enough and that the risk of population declines and species
   extinctions over the coming decades is therefore elevated, assuming
   warming trends continue.

   A further sobering element of Radchuk's new study is that the 13
   species for which forecasting was done are (currently) relatively
   common and abundant, and hence well-studied. The fear is that the
   prognosis could be much worse for other poorly studies species that are
   already currently rare or endangered. One must, however, be careful not
   to tar all species with the same brush – some may be more susceptible
   to climate change than others, and others still (including potential
   pest species) may even thrive in a warmer world.

   Meanwhile, our wildlife faces a suite of other more immediate threats
   including habitat loss, pollution, unsustainable hunting or bycatch,
   and invasive species. One or two of these alone would be bad enough,
   but taken together they can push species over the edge rapidly. It is
   therefore vital that we push our leaders and policy makers into climate
   action and support organisations like Birdwatch Ireland and others that
   continue to do vital on-the-ground conservation work and awareness
   raising, to give birds and their habitats a fighting chance.
