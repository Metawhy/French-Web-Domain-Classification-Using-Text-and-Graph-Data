   "We were amazed at how beautiful this hotel was. We reserved a two
   queen hotel room which came with a mini bar, microwave, mini
   refrigerator and sink. The room had great details and a small indoor
   patio that overlooked the pool. Their breakfast was one of the best. I
   would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely come back."

   - Grace C, California

   "I just love the Hotel Aspen. It has a wonderful location right on the
   bus route with the bus stop for all the hills just steps away. As well,
   the hotel is conveniently located just minutes away from all the action
   in Aspen...

   ...The other thing I love about the Hotel Aspen is the happy hour
   complete with drinks and snacks. Every night there is something
   delicious on offer for guests. The facilities and staff are wonderful
   at this hotel..."

   - Mary D, Toronto

   "Service at the hotel was fantastic across the board. In particular,
   Charles went the extra mile to help me get to my airport in time for my
   flight despite a ton of traffic. Hotel is also well located in downtown
   Aspen, easy walking distance to a number of great bars and
   restaurants."
