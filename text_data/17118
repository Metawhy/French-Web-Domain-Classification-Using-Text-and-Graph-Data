   Answers to Privacy Questions

Does Care2 ask for personal information?

   Yes. Care2 asks for your name and other personal information when you
   sign up for our services.

   How Does Care2 use my personal information?

   Personal and Demographic Information:

   Care2 asks for personal information, such as your name, email address,
   date of birth, street address, zip code and sometimes phone number.
   Your personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to
   allow you to use Care2 member services. Care2 may also ask for
   demographic information, such as your education level, occupation and
   industry. Care2 does not knowingly collect information from children
   under 13; if Care2 later learns that a child under 13 is registered,
   steps will be taken to remove the child's information from the
   database. We also reserve the right to collect publicly available data
   about you, either obtained directly by us or through a 3rd party.

   ThePetitionSite:

   Care2 owns and maintains the nonpartisan petition tool,
   ThePetitionSite.com. Petition and Public Comment signers are required
   to provide certain personal information such as name, email address and
   often street address. This information is required to validate the
   petition signature / public comment. Care2 uses cookies and a signature
   database to provide data integrity and ease of use.

   For pages you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state,
   country and comments as public information. For example, we may provide
   compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the President and
   legislators, other targets, or to the press. Unless you have requested
   to be included as "anonymous," this information will also be visible on
   the website. We will not make your street address publicly available,
   but we may transmit it to members of Congress, to other public
   officials, or to other targets as part of a petition to validate your
   signature. We may also make your comments, along with your first name,
   city, state and country, available to the press and public online.

   For some petitions we provide an advocacy service allowing individuals
   to send individual e-mails to public officials, legislators, and other
   targets as well as public comments to government agencies, through our
   website. These messages are sent in your name, with your e-mail address
   as the return address and your full name and contact information is
   provided as part of the submission. These messages will only be sent
   out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis by
   signing an action. You are solely responsible for the specific
   message(s) you send using our email tool. Optional comments will be
   included in the body of the email message delivered to the petition
   target.

   During the signing process, you may opt to receive certain newsletters
   and memberships, in which case Care2 will send your contact
   information, including email address, street address, and sometimes
   phone, to those third-party providers. However, unless you specifically
   opt to receive such offers or send your contact information to third
   parties during the signing process, Care2 will keep your email address
   information confidential. Note that for many campaigns, the default
   settings assume that you want to receive communications from the
   petition sponsor. If you do not wish to receive such communications,
   please uncheck the box next to the signup offer. Please note that when
   you join a third party we may use your petition activity to personalize
   the actions you see on the site and that we send to you by email.

   Newsletters:

   Care2 offers a variety of newsletters. If you no longer wish to receive
   our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of
   receiving them by following the unsubscribe instructions included in
   each newsletter, or by going to your My Subscriptions page to change
   your subscription preferences.

   Facebook Connect:

   You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook
   Connect. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you
   the option to share certain personal information with us such as your
   name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like
   Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your
   activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others
   within your network.

   Links to 3rd Party Sites:

   Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may
   differ from those of Care2.com. If you submit personal information to
   any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy
   policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any
   Web site you visit.

   Will Care2 disclose any of my personal information?

   Care2 will share your personal information with third parties only in
   the ways that are described in this privacy policy. Please see the
   section above about ThePetitionsite to learn how your petition
   signature information is shared. In certain situations, Care2 may be
   required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by
   public authorities, including to meet national security or law
   enforcement requirements. Care2 will only disclose your personal
   information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary
   to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
   investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, such as to
   comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or to protect the
   rights or property of Care2, or as necessary to provide personalized
   Care2 member services. If Care2 is involved in a merger, acquisition,
   or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via
   email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in
   ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices
   you may have regarding your personal information. Care2 may also
   disclose your personal information, including name and contact
   information in some limited circumstances such as when you specifically
   opt to receive a 3rd party newsletter. We may also provide information
   to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under
   confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal
   information to communicate with you about offers from Care2 and our
   marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any
   independent right to share this information or use for any other
   purposes other than to provide these services to us. If you do not want
   us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us
   through our Help Request Form. Under confidentiality agreements, Care2
   may also match user information with third-party data. Also, Care2 does
   disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, X% of our users are
   female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners,
   advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

   How do I change or delete my personal information?

   Please contact Care2 using the Help Request Form.

   Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?

   Care2 offers e-mail subscriptions describing action alerts, petition
   success stories, new site features, and more, including commercial and
   non-commercial offers. If you do not want to receive any of our
   optional mailings, simply opt out of them when registering to become a
   member or during other subscription opportunities, or click the
   "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any Care2 email that you receive.

   If you sign a petition on ThePetitionSite.com, you will automatically
   receive emailed news updates about the petition and other important
   causes.

   Regardless of the above, Care2 may send occasional emailed messages,
   such as critical service announcements or other correspondence, to all
   registered members. To stop all such announcements, you must delete
   your account. You may do so by following this link.

   Care2 also offers optional mailings from our partner nonprofit
   organizations and from commercial entities. If you elect to receive any
   of these newsletters, some personal information, including your name
   and email address, will be sent to the respective nonprofit or
   commercial entity delivering the newsletter. In these cases, Care2
   would no longer be able to track and control the user information. The
   user would be able to contact the newsletter publishers in order to
   control subscription preferences.

   Does Care2 use Tracking Technologies?

   Yes, cookies and other tracking technologies are used on Care2 in
   several ways.
     * As is true of most web sites, Care2.com gathers certain information
       automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP)
       addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),
       referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or
       clickstream data. We do link this automatically collected data to
       other information collected about site visitors.
     * Care2 and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to
       analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements
       around the website, and to gather demographic information about our
       user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the
       individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it
       may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website
       or service. To manage Flash cookies, please click here.

   Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?

   We would only provide user email addresses to nonprofit or advertising
   partners with the user's direct permission. We respect your privacy and
   despise spam.

   As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit
   partner newsletters or other commercial offers. When you opt to receive
   such an offer via Care2, we will send your email address and other
   necessary contact information to the newsletter publisher. Depending on
   the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid to Care2. Care2 will
   never offer newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your address
   information to, organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or
   adult-content providers.

   Why then do some people receive spam at an email address they have only
   used on Care2? In many cases, spammers create a "dictionary attack" by
   combining common names and initials to create a list of email addresses
   that might or might not work. In many cases, Care2 members send email
   from a Care2 account's email address to a friend or family member whose
   computer gets a virus or whose email account is hacked, resulting in
   private email addresses being revealed to the spammer. In other cases,
   two people have similar addresses, perhaps differing by only 1-2
   characters, and one user makes a typographic mistake that results in
   the other user's address. The bottom line is that if you receive spam,
   it did not come from or through Care2. We despise spam, and we do not
   associate ourselves with spammers.

   With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message
   sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages that
   might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do
   not sell, rent, give, or share e-mail addresses to other companies,
   unless you have specifically opted to receive such communications.

   How does Care2 secure your information and its data storage?

   We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal
   information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
   receive it. Care2's servers are located at a world-class co-location
   facility in California, USA. The facility has some of the most powerful
   physical security systems in the business, from advanced smoke
   detection and fire suppression systems to 24/7 secured access with
   motion sensors, video camera surveillance, and security breach alarms.
   Only qualified Care2 engineers are given access to the building.

   Access to the database is restricted. All servers are protected by a
   firewall and secure data lines. Server access is restricted to
   qualified Care2 employees, on an as-needed basis to maintain the
   operation of the website.

   Although we maintain strict policies and procedures to safeguard our
   servers and our customers' data, it is not possible to guarantee
   security due to the inherent risks of transmitting data over the
   Internet.

   What is Care2's data retention policy?

   We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or
   as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations,
   resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

   What else should I know about my privacy?

   Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
   information online, that information can be collected and used by
   others. In short, by posting personal information online that is
   publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other
   parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your
   personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of
   any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at
   your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy
   of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
   responsible whenever you are online.

   What happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?

   Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy, but will notify
   users of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the
   site. In the event of any material change, this notification will be
   prior to that change becoming effective. If the change involves the use
   of a user's personally identifiable information then the notice to
   users will contain directions on how users can opt-out of the change.

   Answers to Privacy Questions

Does Care2 ask for personal information?

   Yes. Care2 asks for your name and other personal information when you
   sign up for our services.

   How Does Care2 use my personal information?

   Personal and Demographic Information:

   Care2 asks for personal information, such as your name, email address,
   date of birth, street address, zip code and sometimes phone number.
   Your personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to
   allow you to use Care2 member services. Care2 may also ask for
   demographic information, such as your education level, occupation and
   industry. Care2 does not knowingly collect information from children
   under 13; if Care2 later learns that a child under 13 is registered,
   steps will be taken to remove the child's information from the
   database. We also reserve the right to collect publicly available data
   about you, either obtained directly by us or through a 3rd party.

   ThePetitionSite:

   Care2 owns and maintains the nonpartisan petition tool,
   ThePetitionSite.com. Petition and Public Comment signers are required
   to provide certain personal information such as name, email address and
   often street address. This information is required to validate the
   petition signature / public comment. Care2 uses cookies and a signature
   database to provide data integrity and ease of use.

   For pages you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state,
   country and comments as public information. For example, we may provide
   compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the President and
   legislators, other targets, or to the press. Unless you have requested
   to be included as "anonymous," this information will also be visible on
   the website. We will not make your street address publicly available,
   but we may transmit it to members of Congress, to other public
   officials, or to other targets as part of a petition to validate your
   signature. We may also make your comments, along with your first name,
   city, state and country, available to the press and public online.

   For some petitions we provide an advocacy service allowing individuals
   to send individual e-mails to public officials, legislators, and other
   targets as well as public comments to government agencies, through our
   website. These messages are sent in your name, with your e-mail address
   as the return address and your full name and contact information is
   provided as part of the submission. These messages will only be sent
   out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis by
   signing an action. You are solely responsible for the specific
   message(s) you send using our email tool. Optional comments will be
   included in the body of the email message delivered to the petition
   target.

   During the signing process, you may opt to receive certain newsletters
   and memberships, in which case Care2 will send your contact
   information, including email address, street address, and sometimes
   phone, to those third-party providers. However, unless you specifically
   opt to receive such offers or send your contact information to third
   parties during the signing process, Care2 will keep your email address
   information confidential. Note that for many campaigns, the default
   settings assume that you want to receive communications from the
   petition sponsor. If you do not wish to receive such communications,
   please uncheck the box next to the signup offer. Please note that when
   you join a third party we may use your petition activity to personalize
   the actions you see on the site and that we send to you by email.

   Newsletters:

   Care2 offers a variety of newsletters. If you no longer wish to receive
   our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of
   receiving them by following the unsubscribe instructions included in
   each newsletter, or by going to your My Subscriptions page to change
   your subscription preferences.

   Facebook Connect:

   You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook
   Connect. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you
   the option to share certain personal information with us such as your
   name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like
   Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your
   activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others
   within your network.

   Links to 3rd Party Sites:

   Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may
   differ from those of Care2.com. If you submit personal information to
   any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy
   policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any
   Web site you visit.

   Will Care2 disclose any of my personal information?

   Care2 will share your personal information with third parties only in
   the ways that are described in this privacy policy. Please see the
   section above about ThePetitionsite to learn how your petition
   signature information is shared. In certain situations, Care2 may be
   required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by
   public authorities, including to meet national security or law
   enforcement requirements. Care2 will only disclose your personal
   information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary
   to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
   investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, such as to
   comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or to protect the
   rights or property of Care2, or as necessary to provide personalized
   Care2 member services. If Care2 is involved in a merger, acquisition,
   or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via
   email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in
   ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices
   you may have regarding your personal information. Care2 may also
   disclose your personal information, including name and contact
   information in some limited circumstances such as when you specifically
   opt to receive a 3rd party newsletter. We may also provide information
   to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under
   confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal
   information to communicate with you about offers from Care2 and our
   marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any
   independent right to share this information or use for any other
   purposes other than to provide these services to us. If you do not want
   us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us
   through our Help Request Form. Under confidentiality agreements, Care2
   may also match user information with third-party data. Also, Care2 does
   disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, X% of our users are
   female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners,
   advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

   How do I change or delete my personal information?

   Please contact Care2 using the Help Request Form.

   Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?

   Care2 offers e-mail subscriptions describing action alerts, petition
   success stories, new site features, and more, including commercial and
   non-commercial offers. If you do not want to receive any of our
   optional mailings, simply opt out of them when registering to become a
   member or during other subscription opportunities, or click the
   "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any Care2 email that you receive.

   If you sign a petition on ThePetitionSite.com, you will automatically
   receive emailed news updates about the petition and other important
   causes.

   Regardless of the above, Care2 may send occasional emailed messages,
   such as critical service announcements or other correspondence, to all
   registered members. To stop all such announcements, you must delete
   your account. You may do so by following this link.

   Care2 also offers optional mailings from our partner nonprofit
   organizations and from commercial entities. If you elect to receive any
   of these newsletters, some personal information, including your name
   and email address, will be sent to the respective nonprofit or
   commercial entity delivering the newsletter. In these cases, Care2
   would no longer be able to track and control the user information. The
   user would be able to contact the newsletter publishers in order to
   control subscription preferences.

   Does Care2 use Tracking Technologies?

   Yes, cookies and other tracking technologies are used on Care2 in
   several ways.
     * As is true of most web sites, Care2.com gathers certain information
       automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP)
       addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),
       referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or
       clickstream data. We do link this automatically collected data to
       other information collected about site visitors.
     * Care2 and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to
       analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements
       around the website, and to gather demographic information about our
       user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the
       individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it
       may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website
       or service. To manage Flash cookies, please click here.

   Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?

   We would only provide user email addresses to nonprofit or advertising
   partners with the user's direct permission. We respect your privacy and
   despise spam.

   As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit
   partner newsletters or other commercial offers. When you opt to receive
   such an offer via Care2, we will send your email address and other
   necessary contact information to the newsletter publisher. Depending on
   the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid to Care2. Care2 will
   never offer newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your address
   information to, organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or
   adult-content providers.

   Why then do some people receive spam at an email address they have only
   used on Care2? In many cases, spammers create a "dictionary attack" by
   combining common names and initials to create a list of email addresses
   that might or might not work. In many cases, Care2 members send email
   from a Care2 account's email address to a friend or family member whose
   computer gets a virus or whose email account is hacked, resulting in
   private email addresses being revealed to the spammer. In other cases,
   two people have similar addresses, perhaps differing by only 1-2
   characters, and one user makes a typographic mistake that results in
   the other user's address. The bottom line is that if you receive spam,
   it did not come from or through Care2. We despise spam, and we do not
   associate ourselves with spammers.

   With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message
   sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages that
   might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do
   not sell, rent, give, or share e-mail addresses to other companies,
   unless you have specifically opted to receive such communications.

   How does Care2 secure your information and its data storage?

   We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal
   information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
   receive it. Care2's servers are located at a world-class co-location
   facility in California, USA. The facility has some of the most powerful
   physical security systems in the business, from advanced smoke
   detection and fire suppression systems to 24/7 secured access with
   motion sensors, video camera surveillance, and security breach alarms.
   Only qualified Care2 engineers are given access to the building.

   Access to the database is restricted. All servers are protected by a
   firewall and secure data lines. Server access is restricted to
   qualified Care2 employees, on an as-needed basis to maintain the
   operation of the website.

   Although we maintain strict policies and procedures to safeguard our
   servers and our customers' data, it is not possible to guarantee
   security due to the inherent risks of transmitting data over the
   Internet.

   What is Care2's data retention policy?

   We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or
   as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations,
   resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

   What else should I know about my privacy?

   Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
   information online, that information can be collected and used by
   others. In short, by posting personal information online that is
   publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other
   parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your
   personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of
   any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at
   your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy
   of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
   responsible whenever you are online.

   What happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?

   Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy, but will notify
   users of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the
   site. In the event of any material change, this notification will be
   prior to that change becoming effective. If the change involves the use
   of a user's personally identifiable information then the notice to
   users will contain directions on how users can opt-out of the change.
