   Sometimes, a creative endeavor turns into a life-changing opportunity.
   Such was the case with Tetra, the first album from C2C, a band of
   high-profile French DJs.

   A history built from scratch
   The four members of C2C, who first met in high school during their
   teenage years, share a common musical culture, a subtle blend of
   electro, hip-hop and various other inspirations, informed by the
   countless hours they spent scouring record shops in search of
   oftentimes obscure vintage LPs in a wide variety of styles, from jazz
   to hip-hop to soul music. Fascinated by the work of Q-Bert or DJ
   Shadow, the founding fathers of turntablism, a musical discipline
   featuring turntables as a bona fide instrument, they set off to make a
   name for themselves at the turn of the millen- nium and soon started
   developing their own unique performing style. Their achievements in the
   competition circuit come second to none. The quartet won the DMC World
   Competition four times in a row (2003-2006), thanks to their unique
   blend of breathtaking technical dexterity and innate musical
   sensitivity. The audiences and juries were asto- nished by their highly
   playful yet remarkably skillful and spectacular routines, and the
   intoxicating jazzy tunes they managed to create by way of their
   surprisingly simple contraptions. Their performances and music videos
   continue to spread like wildfire, totaling more than 30 million views
   on Youtube alone.

   Individual quest
   Aside from their adventures within C2C, all four members left their
   marks on the French musical scene. 20syl and Greem founded Hocus Pocus,
   which is now widely recognized as one of the most sophisticated and
   accomplished hip-hop acts in Europe. They released a gold-certified
   album on Motown, earning two nominations at the French Grammies. The
   Atom-Pfel duo morphed into Beat Torrent and rocked the dance floors as
   one of the French electro scene’s edgiest formations. Together, they
   can boast more than a thousand live performances. They never stopped
   collaborating, featuring on each other’s albums, and in their minds C2C
   never ceased to exist. But 2010 was the year when they finally reunited
   and locked themselves up in 20syl’s studio to produce their first album
   as a single entity.

   C2C

   Reunited
   C2C’s true purpose had always been to produce music, or rather to
   devise a brand new way to create and perform music. Now in their
   thirties, the quartet has matured without losing any of its enthusiasm
   and energy. The turntable remains their instrument of choice, but
   rather than relying on borrowed samples and scratches, C2C recorded an
   extensive palette of instruments including strings, brass, guitar,
   bass, keys, etc., often played and recorded with old-school equipment
   in order to capture the elusive “seventies sound” they so cherish.
   Harpsichord tunes meet funky breakbeats without ever disrupting the
   harmony of the flow. A truly epileptic way of composing and arranging,
   a genuine cut-up frenzy turn their music into a living matter ready for
   any kind of experiment.

   Transcending boundaries
   Skill and technique are mere servants to the greater cause of music.
   Thanks to their uncanny way of manipulating sounds and textures – which
   clearly sets C2C apart from traditional DJ acts – the four artists have
   injected the warmth they’ve extracted from vintage instruments into
   modern vehicles built out of rock, rap and electro, made all the more
   moving and versatile by the ubiquitous presence of scratch. F·U·Y·A and
   Down the Road, released in January 12, acted as triggers and introduced
   the C2C phenomenon to the Internet. A few months later, the album Tetra
   confirmed all this potential and more. The result is not a simple DJ
   album, it’s an acrobatic yet deeply melodic and atmospheric set of
   pieces, a uniquely electrifying blend of electro, soul and hip-hop
   moods. It gives a whole new meaning to the term “French Touch.”

   TETRA – Logic
   Tetra opens Pandora’s box, a realm of infinite possibilities, a musical
   kaleidoscope merging overtones from a 1950’s New York clubhouse and a
   futuristic London dance floor. A stunningly creative deluge of moods
   which has already been certified double platinum in France, earning the
   band 4 trophies out of 4 nominations – by far the best performance for
   any artist – during the 2013 edition of the French Grammies, including
   “Best New Artist”, “Best Music Video” and “Best Live Show”. The same
   goes for the vocal tracks, featuring a wide variety of talented
   vocalists such as rappers Blitz the Ambassador or Pigeon John,
   Scandinavian singer Jay-Jay Johanson (Give Up the Ghost), soul-man
   Oliver Daysoul (Who are you), French rock-band Gush, and a truly royal
   Banquet featuring famous DJs Tigerstyle, Netik, Rafik, Vajra and
   Kentaro.

   Visual identity
   The distinctive visual style C2C has cultivated since they started
   working on this album, using 20Syl’s design concepts as a common
   thread, plays a central role in the close relationship they established
   with their audience, as illustrated by the bold aesthetics of their
   music videos. Coherence in diversity is the rule, from Arcades’
   fragmented imagery to F·U·Y·A’s monastic austerity, shot inside a
   history-laden abbey, The Beat’s intensely graphic tour de force, Down
   the Road’s urban fairy tale featuring legendary skater Richie Jackson,
   and director Wendy Jackson’s irresis- tibly groovy Happy, which will
   leave no one unmoved.

   Live deejaying… reinvented
   On-stage visuals are an essential part of the show, and play a major
   role in setting C2C apart from most DJ acts who tend to stay stuck
   behind their turntables. The band uses tailor-made LED-display systems
   to provide a dynamic visual representation of their performance, thus
   materializing their scratching acrobatics. During the summer 2012,
   their electrifying live show with stunning visual effects on an
   elevated stage set ablaze Europe’s greatest music festi- vals, in front
   of an increasingly large audience. In October 2012, the band set out to
   conquer the foreign market and went to London, Berlin and Amsterdam to
   perform in sold out concerts. In early 2013, they received two European
   Border Breaker Awards, a distinction granted to artists with a great
   international touring potential, one as the laureate for France, the
   other being the Public choice award. The band is touring the biggest
   and most prestigious French venues in the first quarter of 2013, and is
   scheduled to perform in the biggest foreign festivals in 2013.

   The new frontier
   From their first mixes crafted during the late 1990’s to today’s public
   recognition, Pfel, Atom, 20syl and Greem have strayed into uncharted
   territory and found themselves in a truly unique position, transcending
   styles and generations. Feeling pressed by the narrow codes of
   turntablism and the inflexible dictums of hip-hop, C2C has stepped out
   of the shadows and into the limelight, all the while opening a new
   breach and inventing a new kind of art: that of the turntable applied
   to genuine musical creation.
