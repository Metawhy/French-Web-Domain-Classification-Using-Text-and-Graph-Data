Information

     * All DNS providers are tested every minute from 200+ locations
       around the world
     * Only IPv4 is used
     * A 1 second timeout is set. If a query takes longer, its marked as
       timeout
     * The data is updated once per hour. Contact us if you need real-time
       data
     * "Raw Performance" is the speed when querying each nameserver
       directly
     * "Resolver Simulation" simulates the algorithm of public DNS
       resolvers and shows the performance from the resolver's point of
       view
     * "Uptime" shows the real uptime of DNS provider. A provider is
       marked as down only if all nameservers go down at the same time.
       (in the select location)
     * "Quality" shows the uptime of nameservers. For example if a
       provider has 4 NS and 1 fails then quality is 75% for that location
       and benchmark. This means even though the provider is marked as
       down a real user could still get an answer thanks to the round
       robin algorithm used by DNS. "Quality" does not represent the real
       uptime of a provider
