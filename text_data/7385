   The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Pioneers Project draws attention
   to the trail-blazers by describing their backgrounds and contributions.
   The photographs were taken by Dr. Ben Shneiderman during his
   professional career, accompanied by personal reflections on his friends
   and colleagues. More profiles will be added as time and resources
   permit. Click on the portraits to learn more about each pioneer and see
   more photos.
   For more information about the project, please see the About page.

   Selected photos, short bios, and extended history now in book form:
   Encounters with HCI Pioneers: A Personal History and Photo Journal.
   Also available from Amazon.
