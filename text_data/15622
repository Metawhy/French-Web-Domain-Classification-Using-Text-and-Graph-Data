   move to Russia in search of work and women alone manage the households
   without being able to work. However, the Russian economic crisis,

The forest is burning, whose fault is it?

   Since early July, fires have been raging in the forests of the Amazonas

   gradually withdrawing from public interest organisations which now rely
   heavily on the private […]

LIMBO – After the Libyan nightmare

   Jean-Paul Mari, Vice President of LIMBO, tells us: I remember Solomon,
   the young Eritrean, his black frizzy hair yellowed by the sun and sea
   water, his haggard eyes. He had drifted for twenty-five days on a
   zodiac in the Mediterranean. There were seventy-five of them at the
   start, five survivors at the finish. His nightmares […]

Mangrove restoration in Senegal: Ten-year assessment

   Between 1980 and 2010, 25% of the mangroves in the Casamance and Sine
   Saloum regions of Senegal disappeared. Rising sea levels have caused an
   increase in water salinity, which has contributed to the destruction of
   the region’s food resources. Since 2009, the Océanium association, in
   partnership with the Carbon Livelihoods Fund, has been committed to […]
