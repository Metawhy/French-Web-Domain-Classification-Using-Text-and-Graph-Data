WebMD Privacy Policy

   WebMD understands how important the privacy of personal information is
   to our users. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we
   collect about you and about your use of WebMD and its services. It will
   explain the choices you have about how your personal information is
   used and how we protect that information. We urge you to read this
   Privacy Policy carefully.

   This Privacy Policy applies to websites owned and operated by WebMD
   that are intended for use by consumers (non-professionals) for
   non-commercial personal, family or household purposes, including
   WebMD.com, MedicineNet.com, RxList.com, OnHealth.com, and
   eMedicineHealth.com and including the mobile optimized versions of
   these sites and our Mobile Device Applications or "Apps" (we refer to
   these sites and Apps collectively as the “WebMD Sites”). We refer to
   the WebMD Sites and Apps, along with the information and services made
   available to you through the WebMD Sites and Apps, as the “Services.”

   This Privacy Policy also applies to the consumer-facing version of the
   WebMD Health Manager Product. However, if you are an employee or health
   plan member who has enabled access to your health record at WebMD.com
   by registering at your employer's or health plan's website, the privacy
   policy applicable to your information at your employer's or health
   plan's website remains applicable to your personal health record at
   WebMD.com. If your employer or health plan account is no longer made
   available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to
   have access to your health information from WebMD.com, using the same
   username and password, but will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

   Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to
   the WebMD Sites also apply to the Apps. If you do not want us to
   collect, use or disclose information about you and your use of the
   Services as described in this Privacy Policy, then you should not use
   the Services. By using the Services, you must agree to the WebMD Terms
   of Use, which is the contract between us and users of the Services.  By
   accepting the WebMD Terms of Use, you confirm that you have read and
   understand this Privacy Policy and the WebMD Cookie Policy and you
   acknowledge that we will store, use and otherwise process your
   information in the United States where we are located.

   References to "WebMD," “we” or “us” mean WebMD LLC, including any
   company that WebMD LLC controls (for example, a subsidiary that WebMD
   LLC owns). WebMD may share information among its subsidiaries or
   websites that it owns or controls, but information collected under this
   Privacy Policy is always protected under the terms of this Privacy
   Policy. Except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, WebMD LLC is
   the data controller responsible for the processing of your personal
   information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collected About You

   Some of our Services (such as certain quizzes or calculators) do not
   retain your personal information, while others (such as WebMD Lab
   Testing and the Ovulation/Pregnancy Calendar and the Healthy Target
   Program in the WebMD App and certain of our registration-only Apps like
   WebMD Baby, WebMD Pregnancy and WebMD Allergy) store your personal
   information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Even if you do not
   register with or provide any personal information to WebMD, we collect
   information about your use of the WebMD Sites and Apps and the
   Services. We may also acquire information about our users from external
   sources.

   When you use the Services, we collect information as follows:

Registration

   While you may use most of the Services without registering, certain
   Services do require that you register with WebMD for them to function
   properly. If you choose to register or update an existing account with
   WebMD or access certain Services, you may be required to provide
   certain personal information, such as your name, address, telephone
   number, gender, email address and date of birth, and a username and
   password to access your WebMD account. You are responsible for ensuring
   the accuracy of the personal information that you submit to WebMD.

Interactive Services

   Some of our Services, such as WebMD Symptom Checker, are interactive
   and may request that you submit health-related information, along with
   other information such as your age and gender. You are not required to
   register with WebMD to use WebMD Symptom Checker and if you are
   registered with WebMD, we do not associate information that you submit
   to the Symptom Checker with registration information that you have
   previously provided.

WebMD Health Manager

   WebMD Health Manager provides you with a secure place to gather, store,
   manage and share your personal information and provides tools and
   services to better manage your health and the health of your family.
   You are required to register with WebMD to use WebMD Health Manager.
   WebMD Health Manager has the ability to use information that you
   provide to send you personalized emails or secure electronic messages.
   However, WebMD does not allow any third parties to gather any data
   about you in connection with your use of the WebMD Health Manager
   including through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.
   Furthermore, WebMD does not use any information that you submit in
   connection with WebMD Health Manager to deliver any advertisements to
   you on or off of the WebMD Sites.

WebMD Lab Testing

   Certain WebMD users located in the United States may be eligible to
   participate in WebMD Lab Testing, a service powered by PWNHealth, which
   enables you to place a secure online order for certain lab tests. Once
   you’ve ordered your test, you’ll visit a designated testing center
   where an experienced lab technician will collect your samples. WebMD
   has selected PWNHealth to provide care coordination (including
   independent physician review of test orders) and other administrative
   services (including processing credit card payments for the lab test
   orders). Ordering a lab test with WebMD Lab Testing requires you to
   register with WebMD. WebMD will share the personal information you use
   to register with WebMD with PWNHealth for purposes of processing and
   administering your lab test order. You will be able to access your lab
   test orders and results from PWNHealth through your WebMD account but
   WebMD will never receive your lab test results or your payment
   information. Only PWNHealth will have access to this information.
   PWNHealth may disclose to WebMD certain personal information in the
   aggregate which does not identify you. PWNHealth will use your personal
   information and other information it collects about you in providing
   the WebMD Lab Testing services in accordance with its privacy policy
   available here and terms of use available here. When you interact with
   WebMD Lab Testing you may interact with certain website pages that are
   hosted by WebMD or by PWNHealth. This Privacy Policy describes what
   information WebMD collects about you when you use WebMD’s Services and
   how that information is used, disclosed, and maintained by WebMD.
   PWNHealth’s privacy policy and terms of use will appear on any website
   page that is hosted by PWNHealth. For the avoidance of doubt, this
   Privacy Policy only applies to the WebMD Site pages hosted by WebMD.
   WebMD and PWNHealth will use cookies and other tracking technologies to
   collect information about your usage of WebMD Lab Testing, including
   which lab tests you have viewed and to statistically analyze trends and
   other user behavior on the WebMD Lab Testing pages. Other than
   PWNHealth, WebMD does not allow any third parties to gather any data
   about you in connection with your purchase of a lab test through WebMD
   Lab Testing including through the use of cookies or other tracking
   technologies. Furthermore, WebMD does not use any personal information
   that you submit in connection with WebMD Lab Testing to deliver any
   advertisements to you on or off of the WebMD Sites.

Email Newsletters

   At registration and at various times as you use the WebMD Sites, you
   will be given the option of providing us with personal information in
   order to receive informational/promotional newsletters – such as a
   newsletter relating to a specific health condition – via email from
   WebMD and/or directly from third parties. From time to time WebMD may
   offer users of third party websites to the opportunity to subscribe to
   our newsletters through those websites. If you elect to subscribe to
   one of our newsletters on a third party website, the operator of that
   website will provide us with the personal information you have provided
   in connection with the subscription request, which we may use in
   accordance with this Privacy Policy as though you had provided it
   directly to WebMD. In WebMD Message Boards, if you turn on the email
   notification for posts you have created or participated in, you'll
   receive an email when there has been any activity on those posts. If
   you later decide you no longer want to receive email updates, you can
   turn it off by navigating to the Email Alerts section in your Message
   Board settings.

Email a Friend

   If you use our Email a Friend service to tell a friend about a feature
   on a WebMD Site or a newsletter, we will ask you for your name, your
   email address and your friend's email address. We will automatically
   send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site
   using your name and email address as the "from" email address. WebMD
   does not use your friend's email information for any other purpose. We
   will only use the information you provide to send the requested email
   to your friend.

   If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your
   personal information and you would like to request that it be removed
   from our database, please use the Contact Us link provided at the
   bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites.

Market Research

   From time to time, WebMD may conduct online research surveys on behalf
   of itself and third parties through email invitations, pop-up surveys
   and online focus groups. When participating in a survey, we may require
   you to provide your location, age and if there’s a sweepstakes
   associated with the market research survey, your name and contact
   information for purposes of sweepstakes administration. The information
   you submit in a survey may be used by WebMD for research and
   measurement purposes, as described below, including to measure the
   effectiveness of content, advertising or programs. The personal
   information you provide in connection with a sweepstakes entry will be
   used for the sole purpose of administering the sweepstakes and as
   required by applicable law. We will not knowingly invite individuals
   who are under the age of 13 to participate in market research surveys.
   Market research surveys conducted by or on behalf of WebMD will contain
   a link to this Privacy Policy.

User Reviews, WebMD Message Boards, and Other Public Forums

   In connection with the use of our Physician Directory, users are able
   to submit provider reviews. WebMD also features several message board
   areas and other public forums where users can post reviews, share
   information and support one another or where users can post questions
   for experts to answer. We also offer online discussions moderated by
   healthcare experts. Our reviews feature in the Physician Directory and
   our message boards are open to the public and should not be considered
   private.

   Any information (including personal information) you share in any
   review, online message board, or other forum is by design open to the
   public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting
   any personal information in any public forum. What you post can be
   seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by
   others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you
   for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the
   information you post may also show up in third-party search engines.

   If you mistakenly post personal information in our message board areas
   and would like it removed, you can send us an email to request that we
   remove it by using the Contact Us link on every page of the
   WebMD Sites. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal
   information.

Emails You Send to WebMD

   This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business
   information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to WebMD by
   email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas,
   concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an
   email to WebMD.

Services and Device Information

   When you access and use the Services, WebMD automatically collects and
   stores in its server logs information from your browser or mobile
   device such as your IP address or unique device identifier, browser
   information (including referring URL), your preferences and settings,
   cookies and information about the content you have viewed and actions
   taken (e.g., search queries, ad engagement, clicks and the associated
   dates and times). WebMD may also collect device-specific information
   when you install and use an App including your device model, operating
   system information, advertising ID (which is a unique, user-resettable
   identification number for advertising associated with a mobile device)
   and App version and usage information. When enabled by you, we collect
   precise location information provided by your mobile device, which you
   may disable through the device settings.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

   We and our partners use cookies to collect information about your use
   of the Services. “Cookies” are small data files assigned to your
   browser when you visit a WebMD Site which enable recognition of your
   browser and collect and store information about your use of the
   Services, as described above. In addition to cookies, we and our
   partners use other tracking technologies that collect information about
   your use of the Services, including mobile identifiers and "web
   beacons" which are small graphic files (sometimes called “clear GIFs”
   or “web pixels”) embedded in a web page or email typically used to
   monitor activity and send relevant information back to a home server
   (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other
   third party). The information collected by such tracking technologies
   may be combined with other information that our partners have access
   to, including your name, email address and physical address, so that we
   can send you materials, either electronically or by direct mail, that
   may be of interest to you.

   Our advertising service partners may use cookies and other tracking
   technologies to collect information about your use of the WebMD Sites,
   including content you have viewed. These third parties may use this
   information to help WebMD deliver advertising on the WebMD Sites and on
   other third party websites based on your browsing activity on the WebMD
   Sites. WebMD may further tailor the advertising on the WebMD Sites and
   these other third party websites based on additional information to the
   extent known by WebMD or these third parties. Two of the third parties
   that WebMD works with are Google and Facebook. In addition to using the
   information it collects performing services for WebMD, Google may also
   use such information as described in its privacy policy. To see how
   Google may use information collected through our use of the Google
   services on the WebMD Sites visit
   https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.  While Facebook does
   not provide any personal information to WebMD, Facebook may use
   information that it has about you and that it collects performing
   services for WebMD (which may be associated with personal information
   that Facebook has about you) as described in its privacy policy
   available at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.

   We also work with third party ad networks to display advertising on our
   WebMD Sites and on third party websites. Our ad network vendors use
   technologies to collect information about your activities on the WebMD
   Sites and in our flagship WebMD App to provide you cookie-based
   targeted advertising on our WebMD Sites and on third party websites
   based upon your browsing activity and your interests.

   For more information about our how cookies and other tracking
   technologies are used in connection with the Services, please read our
   Cookie Policy.

   When you download and install one of our Apps onto your mobile device
   we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot
   be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you
   personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We
   use this random number in a manner similar to our use of cookies as
   described in this Privacy Policy and in our Cookie Policy. Unlike
   cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App
   itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your
   browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through
   settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the
   purposes for which we use cookies, please do not use the Apps. Our use
   of cookies and other tracking technologies on our mobile optimized
   sites and our flagship WebMD App are similar to our use on our desktop
   sites. Your choices to reject cookies, use the Network Advertising
   Initiative and the opt-out mechanism described below in the section
   "Your Choices and Rights" are available on our flagship WebMD App and
   on our mobile optimized sites.

How Information Collected About You Is Used

   Information about your use of the Services may be used for the
   following purposes:
     * to provide, improve and create new Services,
     * to respond to your inquiries and to send you administrative
       communications about the WebMD Sites and Services,
     * to obtain your feedback about the WebMD Sites and Services,
     * to send you secure electronic messages and personalized emails
       pertaining to your interests as inferred from your use of the
       Services, including news, announcements, reminders and
       opportunities from WebMD,
     * to statistically analyze trends and user behavior and activity
       including how frequently areas of the WebMD Sites are visited, how
       the Services are being used and how many emails are received and
       opened,
     * to provide you and people with similar demographic characteristics
       and interests with more relevant content including advertising both
       on and off the WebMD Sites and Apps,
     * to offer lead generation services,
     * to detect and defend against fraud and other threats to the
       Services and our users,
     * to identify issues with the Services,
     * to conduct research and measurement activities, including those
       described below, and
     * to administer your account.

   In addition, WebMD may use personal information about you for other
   purposes that are disclosed to you at the time we collect the
   information and/or with your consent.

   WebMD may combine your personal information and other information
   collected about your use of the Services, and also supplement with
   information from external sources for the purposes described in this
   Privacy Policy. For example, information that WebMD collects about you
   may be combined by WebMD with other information available to WebMD
   through third parties for research and measurement purposes, including
   measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs. This
   information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic,
   geographic, personal interests, product purchase activity or other
   information. We may report aggregate information, which is not able to
   be identified back to an individual user of the WebMD Sites, to our
   current or prospective advertisers and other business partners.

Sharing Your Information

WebMD Subsidiaries and Corporate Affiliates

   We may share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and
   companies acquired by or merged with us and our affiliates. In the
   event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a
   sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of
   assets or a bankruptcy, WebMD reserves the right to transfer your
   personal information to the new party in control or the party acquiring
   assets. In the event of such a change, your personal information will
   continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless
   any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance with the
   section below that discusses “Changes to This Privacy Policy.”

Companies and Contractors that Work with WebMD

   WebMD works with third party companies and contractors that help us
   provide the Services and to otherwise assist in the operation of the
   WebMD Sites and Apps, including those that provide services relating to
   technology, data analysis, research, email management and deployment,
   sweepstakes and contest administration, advertising and marketing
   and/or content. WebMD contractors sometimes have limited access to your
   information in the course of providing products or services to WebMD.
   We contractually require that our contractors not use or disclose your
   information for any purpose other than providing the limited service or
   function for WebMD.

Third Party Advertisers and Third Party Websites

   We may share information that we have about you, such as a cookie ID or
   IP address, with third party advertising service providers who may use
   this information, on our behalf, to help WebMD deliver advertising on
   the WebMD Sites as well as on third party websites, as further
   described in our Cookie Policy.

   Certain content, services and advertisements offered to you through the
   WebMD Sites are served on, or contain links to, websites hosted and
   operated by a company other than WebMD ("Third Party Websites"). WebMD
   does not share your personal information with these Third Party
   Websites without your consent, but you should be aware that any
   information you disclose to these Third Party Websites once you access
   these Third Party Websites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. WebMD
   does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of
   these Third Party Websites. You should review the privacy policy posted
   on the Third Party Website to understand how that Third Party Website
   collects and uses your information. WebMD makes an effort to make it
   obvious to you when you leave a WebMD Site and enter a Third Party
   Website, either by requiring you to click on a link or by notifying you
   on the WebMD Site before you visit the third party site. In addition,
   if you see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with"
   followed by the name of a company other than WebMD, then you are on a
   website hosted by a company other than WebMD.  When you use a
   co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of WebMD, such as
   WebMD Lab Testing), or register or otherwise provide information on a
   co-branded site, where applicable, we may pass the collected
   information back to that partner, which may include third party service
   providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the
   Services.

   We may also include social widgets on the WebMD Sites which enable you
   to interact with the associated social media services, e.g., to share
   an article. These widgets may collect browsing data which may be
   received by the third party that provided the widget, and are
   controlled by these third parties. You may be able to manage your
   privacy preferences directly with the applicable social network
   platform.

Compliance with Law, Regulation, and Law Enforcement Requests

   To cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private
   parties to enforce and comply with law, we may release personal
   information to third parties: (1) to comply with legal requirements
   such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; (2)
   when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect
   our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
   fraud, or respond to a government request; or (3) in special cases,
   such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect
   property or defend or assert legal rights. In addition, we may disclose
   personal information as described below.

How Your Information is Secured and Retained

   We take reasonable security measures to protect the security of your
   personal information. Despite WebMD's efforts to protect your personal
   information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party
   may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of
   your information over the Internet may be intercepted.

   The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you
   enter personal information (including personal health information in
   various Services), we encrypt the transmission of that information or
   use SSL connections (Secure Socket Layer) technology.

   We will retain your personal information as long as your account is
   active or as needed to provide you Services. At any time you can remove
   your personal information or instruct us to remove it, but you should
   be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and
   every record of the information you have provided to WebMD from our
   servers. See “Your Choices and Rights” below for more information on
   how you can update or remove your personal information. We will also
   retain your personal information as necessary to comply with legal
   obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

Your Choices and Rights

Updating/Removing Your Personal Information

   If you do not want your personal information used by WebMD as provided
   in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the WebMD Sites, Apps and
   Services.  You can correct, update or review personal information you
   have previously submitted by going back to the specific Service,
   logging-in and making the desired change. You can also update any
   personal information you have submitted by contacting us using the
   contact information listed below or through the Contact Us link
   provided at the bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites.

   If you have registered and desire to delete any of your registration
   information you have provided to us from our systems please contact us
   using the contact information listed below in the “Contacting WebMD
   About Your Personal Information or Privacy” section or through the
   Contact Us link provided at the bottom of every page of the WebMD
   Sites. Upon your request, we will delete your registration information
   from our active databases and where feasible from our back-up media.
   You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove
   each and every record of the information you have provided to the WebMD
   Sites from our servers.

   When you sign up to receive email communications for any of our
   Services, including our email newsletters, or at any time, you can
   choose to opt out of receiving additional newsletters or other email
   communications from WebMD or our advertisers or sponsors.

   You can unsubscribe from an email newsletter by:
     * Following the directions included at the bottom of the newsletter
       and using the “Unsubscribe” link found in the emails.
     * Logging in to the WebMD Sites and unchecking the newsletters you no
       longer wish to receive under the “My Profile” section.

   If you decide that you would prefer not to receive personalized email
   or secure electronic messages from the WebMD Health Manager tool, you
   may also "Opt-out" of the Service by clicking on the settings tab on
   your Health Manager home page and changing your email preference or
   following the unsubscribe instructions included in each email.

   All promotional emails that WebMD sends with opportunities from WebMD
   or with offers or informational materials from WebMD on behalf of our
   sponsors will contain an opportunity to unsubscribe from getting
   additional emails of that type in the future from WebMD unless you
   re-subscribe.

Cookies

   Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. Most browsers offer
   instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the
   "Help" or “Settings” or “Preferences” section of your browser’s
   toolbar.  Refer to our Cookie Policy for additional information about
   opting out of Cookies.

Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out

   In order to give you more control over your privacy choices we have
   implemented a DAA (Digital Advertising Alliance) approved opt-out
   mechanism for interest-based advertising. At the bottom of every page
   of the WebMD Sites you will see an AdChoices logo (which looks like
   this: Ad Choices ).  In our flagship WebMD App you can find the
   AdChoices option in the “Settings” screen.  By clicking on that logo on
   the WebMD Sites or following the instructions in the flagship WebMD
   App, you will be presented with a window that will identify all of the
   companies that WebMD uses to direct tailored advertisements to you,
   both on the WebMD Sites and in the flagship WebMD App as well as on
   third-party websites. If you would like to stop this tailored
   advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the
   choices in that window. Please note that even if you opt-out of
   interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic
   advertisements through the Services. Please note that your choice to
   stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser or mobile device
   that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer
   or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different
   computer or mobile device as well please opt out from that computer or
   mobile device too. By clicking the + symbol next to the name of a
   vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that
   vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements. The WebMD Sites
   do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals. This opt-out
   mechanism is available in the flagship WebMD App for iOS and Android,
   as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently
   available on our other Apps (WebMD Pregnancy, WebMD Baby and WebMD
   Allergy).

Mobile Opt-out

   You may also control interest-based advertising on your mobile device
   by enabling the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting in your iOS device’s
   settings or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your Android device’s
   settings. This will not prevent you from seeing advertisements, but
   will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads
   based on your interests.  If you have questions about how to reject
   cookies on your specific device please check with the device
   manufacturer.

California Residents

   FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA ONLY. Section 1798.83 of the California
   Civil Code requires select businesses to disclose policies relating to
   the sharing of certain categories of your personal information with
   third parties. If you reside in California and have provided your
   personal information to us, you may request information about our
   disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third
   parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.
   You can submit such request by sending an email by using the Contact Us
   link at the bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites.

   are not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13.

   actually know is under the age of 13. A parent or guardian, however,
   may use WebMD Health Manager to establish a personal health record and

   solely responsible for providing supervision of the minor's use of
   WebMD Health Manager. The parent or guardian assumes full
   responsibility for ensuring that the registration information is kept
   secure and that the information submitted is accurate. The parent or
   guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and
   use of any information or suggestions provided through WebMD Health
   Manager for the minor.

   States.  The personal information that you provide to us is stored on
   servers located in the United States. If you are located in another

   Policy. We may transfer your information outside the United States to
   service providers with operations in other countries. By using the
   Services, you consent to such collection, storage and processing in the
   United States and elsewhere, though the United States and other
   jurisdictions may not afford the same level of data protection as
   considered adequate in your own country. We will take reasonable steps
   to protect your personal information. Note that your personal
   information may be available to the United States government or its
   agencies under legal process made in the United States.

   necessary to comply with a legal obligation such as a law, regulation,

   Service, logging-in and making the desired change); (iii) in certain
   circumstances, you can object to our processing of your personal
   information and we will discontinue such processing unless we have
   compelling legitimate grounds to continue; (iv) withdraw consent
   previously provided (however a withdrawal does not affect the
   lawfulness of processing of your personal data that occurred prior to
   the date of withdrawal); or (v) if you believe that we have not
   complied with applicable data protection laws, you may lodge a
   complaint with your local supervisory authority. If you wish to inquire

   share your information to perform services on our behalf.  When we no
   longer need to use your personal information and there is no need for
   us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we

WebMD Privacy Policy

   WebMD understands how important the privacy of personal information is
   to our users. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we
   collect about you and about your use of WebMD and its services. It will
   explain the choices you have about how your personal information is
   used and how we protect that information. We urge you to read this
   Privacy Policy carefully.

   This Privacy Policy applies to websites owned and operated by WebMD
   that are intended for use by consumers (non-professionals) for
   non-commercial personal, family or household purposes, including
   WebMD.com, MedicineNet.com, RxList.com, OnHealth.com, and
   eMedicineHealth.com and including the mobile optimized versions of
   these sites and our Mobile Device Applications or "Apps" (we refer to
   these sites and Apps collectively as the “WebMD Sites”). We refer to
   the WebMD Sites and Apps, along with the information and services made
   available to you through the WebMD Sites and Apps, as the “Services.”

   This Privacy Policy also applies to the consumer-facing version of the
   WebMD Health Manager Product. However, if you are an employee or health
   plan member who has enabled access to your health record at WebMD.com
   by registering at your employer's or health plan's website, the privacy
   policy applicable to your information at your employer's or health
   plan's website remains applicable to your personal health record at
   WebMD.com. If your employer or health plan account is no longer made
   available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to
   have access to your health information from WebMD.com, using the same
   username and password, but will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

   Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to
   the WebMD Sites also apply to the Apps. If you do not want us to
   collect, use or disclose information about you and your use of the
   Services as described in this Privacy Policy, then you should not use
   the Services. By using the Services, you must agree to the WebMD Terms
   of Use, which is the contract between us and users of the Services.  By
   accepting the WebMD Terms of Use, you confirm that you have read and
   understand this Privacy Policy and the WebMD Cookie Policy and you
   acknowledge that we will store, use and otherwise process your
   information in the United States where we are located.

   References to "WebMD," “we” or “us” mean WebMD LLC, including any
   company that WebMD LLC controls (for example, a subsidiary that WebMD
   LLC owns). WebMD may share information among its subsidiaries or
   websites that it owns or controls, but information collected under this
   Privacy Policy is always protected under the terms of this Privacy
   Policy. Except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, WebMD LLC is
   the data controller responsible for the processing of your personal
   information as described in this Privacy Policy.

   Some of our Services (such as certain quizzes or calculators) do not
   retain your personal information, while others (such as WebMD Lab
   Testing and the Ovulation/Pregnancy Calendar and the Healthy Target
   Program in the WebMD App and certain of our registration-only Apps like
   WebMD Baby, WebMD Pregnancy and WebMD Allergy) store your personal
   information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Even if you do not
   register with or provide any personal information to WebMD, we collect
   information about your use of the WebMD Sites and Apps and the
   Services. We may also acquire information about our users from external
   sources.

   When you use the Services, we collect information as follows:

Registration

   While you may use most of the Services without registering, certain
   Services do require that you register with WebMD for them to function
   properly. If you choose to register or update an existing account with
   WebMD or access certain Services, you may be required to provide
   certain personal information, such as your name, address, telephone
   number, gender, email address and date of birth, and a username and
   password to access your WebMD account. You are responsible for ensuring
   the accuracy of the personal information that you submit to WebMD.

Interactive Services

   Some of our Services, such as WebMD Symptom Checker, are interactive
   and may request that you submit health-related information, along with
   other information such as your age and gender. You are not required to
   register with WebMD to use WebMD Symptom Checker and if you are
   registered with WebMD, we do not associate information that you submit
   to the Symptom Checker with registration information that you have
   previously provided.

WebMD Health Manager

   WebMD Health Manager provides you with a secure place to gather, store,
   manage and share your personal information and provides tools and
   services to better manage your health and the health of your family.
   You are required to register with WebMD to use WebMD Health Manager.
   WebMD Health Manager has the ability to use information that you
   provide to send you personalized emails or secure electronic messages.
   However, WebMD does not allow any third parties to gather any data
   about you in connection with your use of the WebMD Health Manager
   including through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.
   Furthermore, WebMD does not use any information that you submit in
   connection with WebMD Health Manager to deliver any advertisements to
   you on or off of the WebMD Sites.

WebMD Lab Testing

   Certain WebMD users located in the United States may be eligible to
   participate in WebMD Lab Testing, a service powered by PWNHealth, which
   enables you to place a secure online order for certain lab tests. Once
   you’ve ordered your test, you’ll visit a designated testing center
   where an experienced lab technician will collect your samples. WebMD
   has selected PWNHealth to provide care coordination (including
   independent physician review of test orders) and other administrative
   services (including processing credit card payments for the lab test
   orders). Ordering a lab test with WebMD Lab Testing requires you to
   register with WebMD. WebMD will share the personal information you use
   to register with WebMD with PWNHealth for purposes of processing and
   administering your lab test order. You will be able to access your lab
   test orders and results from PWNHealth through your WebMD account but
   WebMD will never receive your lab test results or your payment
   information. Only PWNHealth will have access to this information.
   PWNHealth may disclose to WebMD certain personal information in the
   aggregate which does not identify you. PWNHealth will use your personal
   information and other information it collects about you in providing
   the WebMD Lab Testing services in accordance with its privacy policy
   available here and terms of use available here. When you interact with
   WebMD Lab Testing you may interact with certain website pages that are
   hosted by WebMD or by PWNHealth. This Privacy Policy describes what
   information WebMD collects about you when you use WebMD’s Services and
   how that information is used, disclosed, and maintained by WebMD.
   PWNHealth’s privacy policy and terms of use will appear on any website
   page that is hosted by PWNHealth. For the avoidance of doubt, this
   Privacy Policy only applies to the WebMD Site pages hosted by WebMD.
   WebMD and PWNHealth will use cookies and other tracking technologies to
   collect information about your usage of WebMD Lab Testing, including
   which lab tests you have viewed and to statistically analyze trends and
   other user behavior on the WebMD Lab Testing pages. Other than
   PWNHealth, WebMD does not allow any third parties to gather any data
   about you in connection with your purchase of a lab test through WebMD
   Lab Testing including through the use of cookies or other tracking
   technologies. Furthermore, WebMD does not use any personal information
   that you submit in connection with WebMD Lab Testing to deliver any
   advertisements to you on or off of the WebMD Sites.

Email Newsletters

   At registration and at various times as you use the WebMD Sites, you
   will be given the option of providing us with personal information in
   order to receive informational/promotional newsletters – such as a
   newsletter relating to a specific health condition – via email from
   WebMD and/or directly from third parties. From time to time WebMD may
   offer users of third party websites to the opportunity to subscribe to
   our newsletters through those websites. If you elect to subscribe to
   one of our newsletters on a third party website, the operator of that
   website will provide us with the personal information you have provided
   in connection with the subscription request, which we may use in
   accordance with this Privacy Policy as though you had provided it
   directly to WebMD. In WebMD Message Boards, if you turn on the email
   notification for posts you have created or participated in, you'll
   receive an email when there has been any activity on those posts. If
   you later decide you no longer want to receive email updates, you can
   turn it off by navigating to the Email Alerts section in your Message
   Board settings.

Email a Friend

   If you use our Email a Friend service to tell a friend about a feature
   on a WebMD Site or a newsletter, we will ask you for your name, your
   email address and your friend's email address. We will automatically
   send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site
   using your name and email address as the "from" email address. WebMD
   does not use your friend's email information for any other purpose. We
   will only use the information you provide to send the requested email
   to your friend.

   If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your
   personal information and you would like to request that it be removed
   from our database, please use the Contact Us link provided at the
   bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites.

Market Research

   From time to time, WebMD may conduct online research surveys on behalf
   of itself and third parties through email invitations, pop-up surveys
   and online focus groups. When participating in a survey, we may require
   you to provide your location, age and if there’s a sweepstakes
   associated with the market research survey, your name and contact
   information for purposes of sweepstakes administration. The information
   you submit in a survey may be used by WebMD for research and
   measurement purposes, as described below, including to measure the
   effectiveness of content, advertising or programs. The personal
   information you provide in connection with a sweepstakes entry will be
   used for the sole purpose of administering the sweepstakes and as
   required by applicable law. We will not knowingly invite individuals
   who are under the age of 13 to participate in market research surveys.
   Market research surveys conducted by or on behalf of WebMD will contain
   a link to this Privacy Policy.

User Reviews, WebMD Message Boards, and Other Public Forums

   In connection with the use of our Physician Directory, users are able
   to submit provider reviews. WebMD also features several message board
   areas and other public forums where users can post reviews, share
   information and support one another or where users can post questions
   for experts to answer. We also offer online discussions moderated by
   healthcare experts. Our reviews feature in the Physician Directory and
   our message boards are open to the public and should not be considered
   private.

   Any information (including personal information) you share in any
   review, online message board, or other forum is by design open to the
   public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting
   any personal information in any public forum. What you post can be
   seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by
   others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you
   for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the
   information you post may also show up in third-party search engines.

   If you mistakenly post personal information in our message board areas
   and would like it removed, you can send us an email to request that we
   remove it by using the Contact Us link on every page of the
   WebMD Sites. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal
   information.

Emails You Send to WebMD

   This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business
   information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to WebMD by
   email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas,
   concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an
   email to WebMD.

Services and Device Information

   When you access and use the Services, WebMD automatically collects and
   stores in its server logs information from your browser or mobile
   device such as your IP address or unique device identifier, browser
   information (including referring URL), your preferences and settings,
   cookies and information about the content you have viewed and actions
   taken (e.g., search queries, ad engagement, clicks and the associated
   dates and times). WebMD may also collect device-specific information
   when you install and use an App including your device model, operating
   system information, advertising ID (which is a unique, user-resettable
   identification number for advertising associated with a mobile device)
   and App version and usage information. When enabled by you, we collect
   precise location information provided by your mobile device, which you
   may disable through the device settings.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

   We and our partners use cookies to collect information about your use
   of the Services. “Cookies” are small data files assigned to your
   browser when you visit a WebMD Site which enable recognition of your
   browser and collect and store information about your use of the
   Services, as described above. In addition to cookies, we and our
   partners use other tracking technologies that collect information about
   your use of the Services, including mobile identifiers and "web
   beacons" which are small graphic files (sometimes called “clear GIFs”
   or “web pixels”) embedded in a web page or email typically used to
   monitor activity and send relevant information back to a home server
   (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other
   third party). The information collected by such tracking technologies
   may be combined with other information that our partners have access
   to, including your name, email address and physical address, so that we
   can send you materials, either electronically or by direct mail, that
   may be of interest to you.

   Our advertising service partners may use cookies and other tracking
   technologies to collect information about your use of the WebMD Sites,
   including content you have viewed. These third parties may use this
   information to help WebMD deliver advertising on the WebMD Sites and on
   other third party websites based on your browsing activity on the WebMD
   Sites. WebMD may further tailor the advertising on the WebMD Sites and
   these other third party websites based on additional information to the
   extent known by WebMD or these third parties. Two of the third parties
   that WebMD works with are Google and Facebook. In addition to using the
   information it collects performing services for WebMD, Google may also
   use such information as described in its privacy policy. To see how
   Google may use information collected through our use of the Google
   services on the WebMD Sites visit
   https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.  While Facebook does
   not provide any personal information to WebMD, Facebook may use
   information that it has about you and that it collects performing
   services for WebMD (which may be associated with personal information
   that Facebook has about you) as described in its privacy policy
   available at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.

   We also work with third party ad networks to display advertising on our
   WebMD Sites and on third party websites. Our ad network vendors use
   technologies to collect information about your activities on the WebMD
   Sites and in our flagship WebMD App to provide you cookie-based
   targeted advertising on our WebMD Sites and on third party websites
   based upon your browsing activity and your interests.

   For more information about our how cookies and other tracking
   technologies are used in connection with the Services, please read our
   Cookie Policy.

   When you download and install one of our Apps onto your mobile device
   we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot
   be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you
   personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We
   use this random number in a manner similar to our use of cookies as
   described in this Privacy Policy and in our Cookie Policy. Unlike
   cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App
   itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your
   browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through
   settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the
   purposes for which we use cookies, please do not use the Apps. Our use
   of cookies and other tracking technologies on our mobile optimized
   sites and our flagship WebMD App are similar to our use on our desktop
   sites. Your choices to reject cookies, use the Network Advertising
   Initiative and the opt-out mechanism described below in the section
   "Your Choices and Rights" are available on our flagship WebMD App and
   on our mobile optimized sites.

How Information Collected About You Is Used

   Information about your use of the Services may be used for the
   following purposes:
     * to provide, improve and create new Services,
     * to respond to your inquiries and to send you administrative
       communications about the WebMD Sites and Services,
     * to obtain your feedback about the WebMD Sites and Services,
     * to send you secure electronic messages and personalized emails
       pertaining to your interests as inferred from your use of the
       Services, including news, announcements, reminders and
       opportunities from WebMD,
     * to statistically analyze trends and user behavior and activity
       including how frequently areas of the WebMD Sites are visited, how
       the Services are being used and how many emails are received and
       opened,
     * to provide you and people with similar demographic characteristics
       and interests with more relevant content including advertising both
       on and off the WebMD Sites and Apps,
     * to offer lead generation services,
     * to detect and defend against fraud and other threats to the
       Services and our users,
     * to identify issues with the Services,
     * to conduct research and measurement activities, including those
       described below, and
     * to administer your account.

   In addition, WebMD may use personal information about you for other
   purposes that are disclosed to you at the time we collect the
   information and/or with your consent.

   WebMD may combine your personal information and other information
   collected about your use of the Services, and also supplement with
   information from external sources for the purposes described in this
   Privacy Policy. For example, information that WebMD collects about you
   may be combined by WebMD with other information available to WebMD
   through third parties for research and measurement purposes, including
   measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs. This
   information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic,
   geographic, personal interests, product purchase activity or other
   information. We may report aggregate information, which is not able to
   be identified back to an individual user of the WebMD Sites, to our
   current or prospective advertisers and other business partners.

Sharing Your Information

WebMD Subsidiaries and Corporate Affiliates

   We may share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and
   companies acquired by or merged with us and our affiliates. In the
   event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a
   sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of
   assets or a bankruptcy, WebMD reserves the right to transfer your
   personal information to the new party in control or the party acquiring
   assets. In the event of such a change, your personal information will
   continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless
   any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance with the
   section below that discusses “Changes to This Privacy Policy.”

Companies and Contractors that Work with WebMD

   WebMD works with third party companies and contractors that help us
   provide the Services and to otherwise assist in the operation of the
   WebMD Sites and Apps, including those that provide services relating to
   technology, data analysis, research, email management and deployment,
   sweepstakes and contest administration, advertising and marketing
   and/or content. WebMD contractors sometimes have limited access to your
   information in the course of providing products or services to WebMD.
   We contractually require that our contractors not use or disclose your
   information for any purpose other than providing the limited service or
   function for WebMD.

Third Party Advertisers and Third Party Websites

   We may share information that we have about you, such as a cookie ID or
   IP address, with third party advertising service providers who may use
   this information, on our behalf, to help WebMD deliver advertising on
   the WebMD Sites as well as on third party websites, as further
   described in our Cookie Policy.

   Certain content, services and advertisements offered to you through the
   WebMD Sites are served on, or contain links to, websites hosted and
   operated by a company other than WebMD ("Third Party Websites"). WebMD
   does not share your personal information with these Third Party
   Websites without your consent, but you should be aware that any
   information you disclose to these Third Party Websites once you access
   these Third Party Websites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. WebMD
   does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of
   these Third Party Websites. You should review the privacy policy posted
   on the Third Party Website to understand how that Third Party Website
   collects and uses your information. WebMD makes an effort to make it
   obvious to you when you leave a WebMD Site and enter a Third Party
   Website, either by requiring you to click on a link or by notifying you
   on the WebMD Site before you visit the third party site. In addition,
   if you see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with"
   followed by the name of a company other than WebMD, then you are on a
   website hosted by a company other than WebMD.  When you use a
   co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of WebMD, such as
   WebMD Lab Testing), or register or otherwise provide information on a
   co-branded site, where applicable, we may pass the collected
   information back to that partner, which may include third party service
   providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the
   Services.

   We may also include social widgets on the WebMD Sites which enable you
   to interact with the associated social media services, e.g., to share
   an article. These widgets may collect browsing data which may be
   received by the third party that provided the widget, and are
   controlled by these third parties. You may be able to manage your
   privacy preferences directly with the applicable social network
   platform.

Compliance with Law, Regulation, and Law Enforcement Requests

   To cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private
   parties to enforce and comply with law, we may release personal
   information to third parties: (1) to comply with legal requirements
   such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; (2)
   when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect
   our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
   fraud, or respond to a government request; or (3) in special cases,
   such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect
   property or defend or assert legal rights. In addition, we may disclose
   personal information as described below.

How Your Information is Secured and Retained

   We take reasonable security measures to protect the security of your
   personal information. Despite WebMD's efforts to protect your personal
   information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party
   may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of
   your information over the Internet may be intercepted.

   The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you
   enter personal information (including personal health information in
   various Services), we encrypt the transmission of that information or
   use SSL connections (Secure Socket Layer) technology.

   We will retain your personal information as long as your account is
   active or as needed to provide you Services. At any time you can remove
   your personal information or instruct us to remove it, but you should
   be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and
   every record of the information you have provided to WebMD from our
   servers. See “Your Choices and Rights” below for more information on
   how you can update or remove your personal information. We will also
   retain your personal information as necessary to comply with legal
   obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

   from our active databases and where feasible from our back-up media.
   You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove
   each and every record of the information you have provided to the WebMD
   Sites from our servers.

   When you sign up to receive email communications for any of our
   Services, including our email newsletters, or at any time, you can
   choose to opt out of receiving additional newsletters or other email
   communications from WebMD or our advertisers or sponsors.

   You can unsubscribe from an email newsletter by:
     * Following the directions included at the bottom of the newsletter
       and using the “Unsubscribe” link found in the emails.
     * Logging in to the WebMD Sites and unchecking the newsletters you no
       longer wish to receive under the “My Profile” section.

   or secure electronic messages from the WebMD Health Manager tool, you
   may also "Opt-out" of the Service by clicking on the settings tab on
   your Health Manager home page and changing your email preference or
   following the unsubscribe instructions included in each email.

   sponsors will contain an opportunity to unsubscribe from getting
   additional emails of that type in the future from WebMD unless you
   re-subscribe.

Cookies

   Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. Most browsers offer
   instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the
   "Help" or “Settings” or “Preferences” section of your browser’s
   toolbar.  Refer to our Cookie Policy for additional information about
   opting out of Cookies.

Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out

   In order to give you more control over your privacy choices we have
   implemented a DAA (Digital Advertising Alliance) approved opt-out
   mechanism for interest-based advertising. At the bottom of every page
   of the WebMD Sites you will see an AdChoices logo (which looks like
   this: Ad Choices ).  In our flagship WebMD App you can find the
   AdChoices option in the “Settings” screen.  By clicking on that logo on
   the WebMD Sites or following the instructions in the flagship WebMD
   App, you will be presented with a window that will identify all of the
   companies that WebMD uses to direct tailored advertisements to you,
   both on the WebMD Sites and in the flagship WebMD App as well as on
   third-party websites. If you would like to stop this tailored
   advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the
   choices in that window. Please note that even if you opt-out of
   interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic
   advertisements through the Services. Please note that your choice to
   stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser or mobile device
   that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer
   or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different
   computer or mobile device as well please opt out from that computer or
   mobile device too. By clicking the + symbol next to the name of a
   vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that
   vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements. The WebMD Sites
   do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals. This opt-out
   mechanism is available in the flagship WebMD App for iOS and Android,
   as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently
   available on our other Apps (WebMD Pregnancy, WebMD Baby and WebMD
   Allergy).

Mobile Opt-out

   You may also control interest-based advertising on your mobile device
   by enabling the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting in your iOS device’s
   settings or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your Android device’s
   settings. This will not prevent you from seeing advertisements, but
   will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads
   based on your interests.  If you have questions about how to reject
   cookies on your specific device please check with the device
   manufacturer.

California Residents

   FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA ONLY. Section 1798.83 of the California
   Civil Code requires select businesses to disclose policies relating to
   the sharing of certain categories of your personal information with
   third parties. If you reside in California and have provided your
   personal information to us, you may request information about our
   disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third
   parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.
   You can submit such request by sending an email by using the Contact Us
   link at the bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites.

   We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The WebMD Sites
   are not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13.
   The WebMD Sites do not collect personal information from any person we
   actually know is under the age of 13. A parent or guardian, however,
   may use WebMD Health Manager to establish a personal health record and
   a WebMD Health Manager home page for a minor. The parent or guardian is
   solely responsible for providing supervision of the minor's use of
   WebMD Health Manager. The parent or guardian assumes full
   responsibility for ensuring that the registration information is kept
   secure and that the information submitted is accurate. The parent or
   guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and
   use of any information or suggestions provided through WebMD Health
   Manager for the minor.

   States.  The personal information that you provide to us is stored on
   servers located in the United States. If you are located in another
   jurisdiction, you should be aware that in order to provide the Services

   where it will be stored and processed in accordance with this Privacy
   Policy. We may transfer your information outside the United States to
   service providers with operations in other countries. By using the
   Services, you consent to such collection, storage and processing in the
   United States and elsewhere, though the United States and other
   jurisdictions may not afford the same level of data protection as
   considered adequate in your own country. We will take reasonable steps
   to protect your personal information. Note that your personal
   information may be available to the United States government or its
   agencies under legal process made in the United States.

   necessary to comply with a legal obligation such as a law, regulation,

   corrected or deleted (in most cases you can correct personal
   information you have submitted to us by going back to the specific

   circumstances, you can object to our processing of your personal
   information and we will discontinue such processing unless we have
   compelling legitimate grounds to continue; (iv) withdraw consent
