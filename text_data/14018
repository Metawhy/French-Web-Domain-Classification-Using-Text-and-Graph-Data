Instagram’s Crackdown on Fake Followers Just Might Work

Instagramʼs promise to root out "inauthentic activity" sends some social
media marketers into crisis.

   Lauren Joseph; Instagram

   Instagram Monday said it would again crack down on users who pursue
   “inauthentic activity” to boost an account’s popularity. Within hours,
   BlackHatWorld, a forum popular with self-proclaimed “black hat” social
   media marketers, was in crisis.

   In a section of the forum usually reserved for sharing the best deals
   on obtaining fake Instagram followers, concerned users started at least
   13 threads to discuss the policy change. “The beginning of the end?”
   asked one user. “It’s happening,” wrote another, posting a link to
   Instagram’s press release, which promised to “begin removing
   inauthentic likes, follows and comments from accounts that use
   third-party apps to boost their popularity.” BlackHatWorld users
   squabbled long into the night over the extent of Instagram’s purge. By
   Tuesday afternoon, several threads had descended into chaos.
   Applications had already started to go offline. It was an illicit
   growth hacker’s worst nightmare—suggesting that this time, perhaps,
   Instagram might actually be on to something.

   Likes, comments, and followers are the currency of Instagram. They are
   the metrics by which we determine a profile’s worth or an idea’s
   popularity, but they can be difficult to amass. From this stems their
   power. An account with tens of thousands of followers inherently seems
   more legitimate, and trustworthy, than one with three. When an account
   reaches 10,000 followers, it’s granted access to one of Instagram’s
   most coveted features: the ability to embed links in Instagram Stories.
   For a relatively link-averse platform like Instagram, the feature is a
   big deal and could be used to drive traffic to a particular site or
   brand. For influencers, who make all or part of their living promoting
   products through Instagram, the stakes are even higher. Payments for
   these deals are determined based on perceived reach, so a higher
   follower count often translates directly into a significantly higher
   paycheck.

   Unlike its real-life counterpart, however, digital popularity can be
   bought in minutes. Engagement manipulation has long plagued platforms
   like YouTube and Twitter, and Instagram is no different. Wannabe
   influencers, new companies, and scammers alike often turn to these
   services to get their profiles off the ground; when done right, fake
   engagement begets real engagement.

   Instagram’s new policy is aimed most squarely at so-called automated
   amplification services. Almost all of these apps require a user to pay
   a subscription fee and turn over their Instagram login credentials, a
   direct violation of the platform’s terms of service and a clear
   security risk. The applications use the credentials to send the user’s
   profile into an automated frenzy of likes, comments, and follows, in an
   attempt to get real users to follow the client’s profile.

   In its announcement, Instagram said that with the help of machine
   learning, it had identified users who had shared their login
   credentials with such services and that it would offer those users an
   ultimatum: Change your password immediately to revoke the service’s
   access to your account, or see your Instagram experience “impacted.”
   Instagram did not respond to multiple requests for additional comment.

   “Many influencers and regular users use these tools to create perceived
   growth in their audience and to appear more successful than they are,”
   Gil Eyal, CEO of Hypr Brands, an influencer marketing company that
   specializes in rooting out fake followers from real ones, told WIRED
   over email.

   As of Tuesday afternoon, a number of BlackHatters reported experiencing
   issues with Jarvee, one of the most recommended Instagram automation
   apps on the forum. In exchange for a subscription fee ranging from
   about $20 to $70 a month, Jarvee lets users automate multiple in-app
   actions, from follows to DMs to reposts and beyond, on up to 150
   accounts across eight social media platforms. Some users who tried to
   use the service Tuesday to automate follows, likes, and other actions
   said they were greeted with a strange error message. “I was thinking
   itʼs because instagram issues ppl had today,” wrote one user, who noted
   that Jarvee pushed out an update that morning. “I have the same issue
   on another bot,” wrote another. “Itʼs because of a instagram update Iʼd
   say.”

   In a message to WIRED, Jarvee said there was “nothing to worry about”
   and dismissed claims that Instagram’s crackdown had any effect on its
   services. A representative from Jarvee said that the service simulates
   traffic from Instagram’s iPhone app in order to fool the company into
   believing it’s a legitimate user. “Just make sure you donʼt do too many
   actions and make sure you make your account look as natural as
   possible,” wrote the Jarvee representative.

   Instagram fakery used to be much simpler. If you wanted more followers,
   you could visit one of the countless slightly sketchy sites offering
   them by the thousand, enter in your credit card details, and watch your
   follower count skyrocket. However, over the past few years, pulling off
   the sort of fraud capable of catapulting a user to genuine popularity
   has become much more difficult. Instagram’s decision to eschew the
   beloved chronological feed in favor of a more mysterious
   algorithmically ranked system left fraudsters scrambling for a
   workaround. Instagram hasn’t shared the specifics of how it ranks
   posts, but it’s clear that its new system prioritizes overall
   engagement—meaning likes, comments, story views, saves, mentions, and
   DMs.

   That has forced aspiring influencers and Insta-stars to take a
   multi-pronged approach to faking their followings. The most common
   methods over the past year or so fall into two main camps: automated
   engagement amplification services and pure paid fakery.

   As of Tuesday afternoon, followers, likes, comments, and story views
   apparently could still be bought from Social Media Marketing (SMM)
   panels, online vendors that use an automated fleet of accounts—or in
   some cases, real people controlling dozens of sock-puppet accounts—to
   provide clients with fake engagement.

   “There is a huge market around this and a huge percentage of
   ‘influencers’ who use these services because they’re so cheap,” says
   Eyal. As of Monday evening, the going rate on one popular panel, SM
   Garden, was $3 to acquire 1,000 followers, $1.80 for 1,000 likes, $1.20
   per 1,000 video views, $1.20 per 1,000 random comments in English, or
   $3 per 1,000 comments with emoji.

   These services may be popular, Eyal says, but they are rarely very
   sophisticated and are pretty easy to spot. They follow and unfollow
   random accounts en masse, post stock photos and images scraped from
   real users, and are often associated with unusual IP addresses. And
   those are just the signs visible to outsiders. Instagram itself has
   access to a wealth of data far beyond what is publicly available, like
   the specific software or application used to make the posts, the timing
   of behavior, and similarities in captions, bios, comments, or posted
   photos.

   Despite this wealth of identifying information, SMM panels continue to
   be popular among users. Instagram’s crackdown on inauthenticity doesn’t
   appear to have affected these accounts yet, and panel companies seem
   relatively well prepared for the challenge. In a message to WIRED, one
   of the administrators behind SM Garden said that the company was aware
   of Instagram’s policy update. The admin said that though SM Garden
   couldn’t predict the future, it always “make [sic] sure that our
   services are closely look real as possible.” SM Garden did not respond
   to questions about the status of its Instagram services currently, but
   the site’s “news feed,” which provides minute to minute updates on the
   availability of its offerings, did not indicate any issues.

How Much Screen Time Should My Kids Get?

Youʼre not really looking for the answer. Youʼre looking for absolution.

   Hotlittlepotato

     Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer questions about your interactions
     with technology.

   Q: How much screen time should my kids get?

   A: Friend, you can look up the answer to this question as well as I
   can. The American Academy of Pediatrics website spells it out for you:
   No screen time for kids under about two, no more than an hour a day for
   kids between two and five. Kids should have limits and “high quality”
   media, and you should make a habit of watching videos / playing games
   with them. Talk to your kids about porn. (Sorry.)

   But you did not come here because you don’t know how to google things.
   You came here because you know that many Silicon Valley types—the very
   inventors of these autoplaying crack slabs—don’t let their kids have
   any screen time at all. And maybe you aspire to that, much the way one
   aspires to be other impossible, implausible things, like a Kardashian.
   Or a monk.

   Also, you have sometimes—maybe often!—let your kids watch non-high
   quality shows (hands up whose kid watches Oggy and the Cockroaches).
   And maybe you feel like you use the iPad as a babysitter, and you feel
   guilty about that, and perhaps you have come here to seek absolution.

   I absolve you. Mostly.

   First, let’s consider the back-to-the-landline types who are
   interdicting or severely limiting their kids’ screen time because that
   shit is way addictive. I wouldn’t mind being able to be that parent,
   much the same way that I wouldn’t mind being able to be the crunchy
   homeschooling mom who teaches her kids trigonometry by building a
   chicken coop and gives them their own hydrometer so they can use it to
   test the homebrew kombucha.

   I am not that, and you are probably not that, either, if you are
   reading this. You and me, we have to go to work and do the dishes and
   make the sandwiches for lunch and volunteer at the school renaming
   voting booth tomorrow morning and the boys are lovely but they are so
   high energy that if you turn your back for one second to try to open
   the jar of mayonnaise, they’re immediately on each other, fighting over
   the rope that they want to use to lash the cat to the bannister, which
   is good for the cat because he gets away in the ensuing scuffle, but
   also now you cannot even remember what a sandwich IS your cortisol
   levels are so high from all the screeching in the background but then
   thank Christ, the clock strikes 6 and it’s time for TV and suddenly the
   house falls silent and you don’t feel like stabbing the mayonnaise jar
   with the spatula spreader any more, but you just give the lid a little
   twist and off it pops. You make the sandwiches.

   That is what screen time is for, that. To give you a bit of breathing
   room, whether it’s Wednesday night or a weekend morning. Don’t give me
   this crap about how it’s not to be used as a babysitter. It is a
   wonderful babysitter. (A corollary to this: A wonderful babysitter
   sticks to the shows you have approved. If you leave your kid watching
   Peppa Pig on YouTube and you come back and they’re watching one of
   those weird off-brand Peppa-the-Decapitated-Nazi Pig things, then
   adjust your household media consumption strategy.) But, imagine that
   this wonderful babysitter is very very expensive. You can’t use it all
   the time. Because you lose something every time you do—you have
   displaced some meaningful activity. Which is ok! Not every moment is a
   learning experience. But screens are definitely the carb of life
   experiences, and probably high-fructose-corn-syrup–containing carbs at
   that. Don’t go overboard.

   And you must not let your precious darlings use screens outside
   whatever window you pre-determine. That’s the main thing, really. If
   you ever ever give in to screens outside the pre-determined time, you
   are absolutely finished. The expensive babysitter who turned your
   chaotic house into a blissful cone of silence will morph into a large
   and perhaps slightly snappish dog who, since you have fed it once from
   the table, hounds you relentlessly all day for more episodes of
   Wonderpets. If the background subviolent sibling rivalry drove you mad,
   the weasely nagging directed straight at you will drive you off a
   cliff.

   Which is to say: Your kids are going to watch screens. You are going to
   feel a little guilty about it. That’s ok. But set your limits (1 hour
   after dinner, 2 in the morning on the weekends, iPads on a trip longer
   than 4 hours is what works for us—your needs may differ) and never,
   ever, ever exceed them.

   And you, fellow parent? How much time are you spending on your phone in
   the house, scrolling pointlessly through Instagram? Maybe set some
   limits on yourself, as well.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sarah Fallon writes about her kids a fair amount, and just wants you to
   know that they’re not really as bad as she sometimes makes them seem
   for comic effect.

   What can we tell you? No, really, what do you want one of our in-house
   experts to tell you? Post your question in the comments or email the
   Know-It-Alls.

Hey Alexa, What Are You Doing to My Kidʼs Brain?

The new Echo Dot Kids edition encourages kids to be polite, but psychologists
and ethicists want parents to ask deeper questions than will Alexa make my
kid a jerk?

   Amazon

   Among the more modern anxieties of parents today is how virtual
   assistants will train their children to act. The fear is that kids who
   habitually order Amazonʼs Alexa to read them a story or command
   Googleʼs Assistant to tell them a joke are learning to communicate not
   as polite, considerate citizens, but as demanding little twerps.

   This worry has become so widespread that Amazon and Google both
   announced this week that their voice assistants can now encourage kids
   to punctuate their requests with "please." The version of Alexa that
   inhabits the new Echo Dot Kids Edition will thank children for "asking
   so nicely." Google Assistantʼs forthcoming Pretty Please feature will
   remind kids to "say the magic word" before complying with their wishes.

   But many psychologists think kids being polite to virtual assistants is
   less of an issue than parents think—and may even be a red herring. As
   virtual assistants become increasingly capable, conversational, and
   prevalent (assistant-embodied devices are forecasted to outnumber
   humans), psychologists and ethicists are asking deeper, more subtle
   questions than will Alexa make my kid bossy? And they want parents to
   do the same.

   "When I built my first virtual child, I got a lot of pushback and
   flak," recalls developmental psychologist Justine Cassell, director
   emeritus of Carnegie Mellonʼs Human-Computer Interaction Institute and
   an expert in the development of AI interfaces for children. It was the
   early aughts, and Cassell, then at MIT, was studying whether a
   life-sized, animated kid named Sam could help flesh-and-blood children
   hone their cognitive, social, and behavioral skills. "Critics worried
   that the kids would lose track of what was real and what was pretend,"
   Cassell says. "That theyʼd no longer be able to tell the difference
   between virtual children and actual ones."

   But when you asked the kids whether Sam was a real child, theyʼd roll
   their eyes. Of course Sam isnʼt real, theyʼd say. There was zero
   ambiguity.

   Nobody knows for sure, and Cassell emphasizes that the question
   deserves study, but she suspects todayʼs children will grow up
   similarly attuned to the virtual nature of our device-dwelling digital
   sidekicks—and, by extension, the context in which they do or do not
   need to be polite. Kids excel, she says, at dividing the world into
   categories. As long as they continue to separate humans from machines,
   she says, thereʼs no need to worry. "Because isn’t that actually what
   we want children to learn—not that everything that has a voice should
   be thanked, but that people have feelings?"

   Point taken. But what about Duplex, I ask, Googleʼs new human-sounding,
   phone calling AI? Well, Cassell says, that complicates matters. When
   you canʼt tell if a voice belongs to a human or a machine, she says,
   perhaps itʼs best to assume youʼre talking to a person, to avoid
   hurting a humanʼs feelings. But the real issue there isnʼt politeness,
   itʼs disclosure; artificial intelligences should be designed to
   identify themselves as such.

   Whatʼs more, the implications of a kid interacting with an AI extend
   far deeper than whether she recognizes it as non-human. "Of course
   parents worry about these devices reinforcing negative behaviors,
   whether itʼs being sassy or teasing a virtual assistant,” says Jenny
   Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at the University of
   Michigan and co-author of the latest guidelines for media use from the
   American Academy of Pediatrics. “But I think there are bigger questions
   surrounding things like kids’ cognitive development—the way they
   consume information and build knowledge.”

   Consider, for example, that the way kids interact with virtual
   assistants may not actual help them learn. This advertisement for the
   Echo Dot Kids Edition ends with a girl asking her smart speaker the
   distance to the Andromeda Galaxy. As the camera zooms out, we hear
   Alexa rattle off the answer: "The Andromeda Galaxy is 14 quintillion,
   931 quadrillion, 389 trillion, 517 billion, 400 million miles away":

   To parents it might register as a neat feature. Alexa knows answers to
   questions that you donʼt! But most kids donʼt learn by simply receiving
   information. "Learning happens happens when a child is challenged,"
   Cassell says, "by a parent, by another child, a teacher—and they can
   argue back and forth."

   Virtual assistants canʼt do that yet, which highlights the importance
   of parents using smart devices with their kids. At least for the time
   being. Our digital butlers could be capable of brain-building banter
   sooner than you think.

   This week, Google announced its smart speakers will remain activated
   several seconds after you issue a command, allowing you to engage in
   continuous conversation without repeating "Hey, Google," or "OK,
   Google." For now, the feature will allow your virtual assistant to keep
   track of contextually dependent follow-up questions. (If you ask what
   movies George Clooney has starred in and then ask how tall he his,
   Google Assistant will recognize that "he" is in reference to George
   Clooney.) Itʼs a far cry from a dialectic exchange, but it charts a
   clear path toward more conversational forms of inquiry and learning.

   And, perhaps, something even more. "I think itʼs reasonable to ask if
   parenting will become a skill that, like Go or chess, is better
   performed by a machine," says John Havens, executive director of the
   the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent
   Systems. "What do we do if a kid starts saying Look, I appreciate the
   parents in my house, because they put me on the map, biologically. But
   dad tells a lot of lame dad jokes. And mom is kind of a helicopter
   parent. And I really prefer the knowledge, wisdom, and insight given to
   me by my devices."

   Havens jokes that he sounds paranoid, because heʼs speculating about
   what-if scenarios from the future. But what about the more near-term?
   If you start handing duties over to the machine, how do you take them
   back the day your kid decides Alexa is a higher authority than you are
   on, say, trigonometry?

   Other experts I spoke with agreed itʼs not too early for parents to
   begin thinking deeply about the long-term implications of raising kids
   in the company of virtual assistants. "I think these tools can be
   awesome, and provide quick fixes to situations that involve answering
   questions and telling stories that parents might not always have time
   for," Radesky says. "But I also want parents to consider how that might
   come to displace some of the experiences they enjoy sharing with kids."

   Other things Radesky, Cassell, and Havens think parents should
   consider: The extent to which kids understand privacy issues related to
   internet-connected toys, how their children interact with devices at
   their friendsʼ houses, and what information other familyʼs devices
   should be permitted to collect about their kids. In other words, how do
   children conceptualize the algorithms that serve up facts and
   entertainment, learn about them, and potentially profit from them?

   "The fact is, very few of us sit down and talk with our kids about the
   social constructs surrounding robots and virtual assistants," Radesky
   says.

   Perhaps that—more than whether their children says "please" and "thank
   you" to the smart speaker in the living room—is what parents should be
   thinking about.

Coming of Age in the Digital Age:

     * Privacy is paramount. Here are the A-B-Cs of keeping your kids safe
       online.
     * Not all screen time (or voice assistant time) is created equal.
       Hereʼs how kids can use time with tech to their advantage.
     * Your kids will look at internet porn. Deal with it.

Instagram’s Crackdown on Fake Followers Just Might Work

Instagramʼs promise to root out "inauthentic activity" sends some social
media marketers into crisis.

   Lauren Joseph; Instagram

   Instagram Monday said it would again crack down on users who pursue
   “inauthentic activity” to boost an account’s popularity. Within hours,
   BlackHatWorld, a forum popular with self-proclaimed “black hat” social
   media marketers, was in crisis.

   In a section of the forum usually reserved for sharing the best deals
   on obtaining fake Instagram followers, concerned users started at least
   13 threads to discuss the policy change. “The beginning of the end?”
   asked one user. “It’s happening,” wrote another, posting a link to
   Instagram’s press release, which promised to “begin removing
   inauthentic likes, follows and comments from accounts that use
   third-party apps to boost their popularity.” BlackHatWorld users
   squabbled long into the night over the extent of Instagram’s purge. By
   Tuesday afternoon, several threads had descended into chaos.
   Applications had already started to go offline. It was an illicit
   growth hacker’s worst nightmare—suggesting that this time, perhaps,
   Instagram might actually be on to something.

   Likes, comments, and followers are the currency of Instagram. They are
   the metrics by which we determine a profile’s worth or an idea’s
   popularity, but they can be difficult to amass. From this stems their
   power. An account with tens of thousands of followers inherently seems
   more legitimate, and trustworthy, than one with three. When an account
   reaches 10,000 followers, it’s granted access to one of Instagram’s
   most coveted features: the ability to embed links in Instagram Stories.
   For a relatively link-averse platform like Instagram, the feature is a
   big deal and could be used to drive traffic to a particular site or
   brand. For influencers, who make all or part of their living promoting
   products through Instagram, the stakes are even higher. Payments for
   these deals are determined based on perceived reach, so a higher
   follower count often translates directly into a significantly higher
   paycheck.

   Unlike its real-life counterpart, however, digital popularity can be
   bought in minutes. Engagement manipulation has long plagued platforms
   like YouTube and Twitter, and Instagram is no different. Wannabe
   influencers, new companies, and scammers alike often turn to these
   services to get their profiles off the ground; when done right, fake
   engagement begets real engagement.

   Instagram’s new policy is aimed most squarely at so-called automated
   amplification services. Almost all of these apps require a user to pay
   a subscription fee and turn over their Instagram login credentials, a
   direct violation of the platform’s terms of service and a clear
   security risk. The applications use the credentials to send the user’s
   profile into an automated frenzy of likes, comments, and follows, in an
   attempt to get real users to follow the client’s profile.

   In its announcement, Instagram said that with the help of machine
   learning, it had identified users who had shared their login
   credentials with such services and that it would offer those users an
   ultimatum: Change your password immediately to revoke the service’s
   access to your account, or see your Instagram experience “impacted.”
   Instagram did not respond to multiple requests for additional comment.

   “Many influencers and regular users use these tools to create perceived
   growth in their audience and to appear more successful than they are,”
   Gil Eyal, CEO of Hypr Brands, an influencer marketing company that
   specializes in rooting out fake followers from real ones, told WIRED
   over email.

   As of Tuesday afternoon, a number of BlackHatters reported experiencing
   issues with Jarvee, one of the most recommended Instagram automation
   apps on the forum. In exchange for a subscription fee ranging from
   about $20 to $70 a month, Jarvee lets users automate multiple in-app
   actions, from follows to DMs to reposts and beyond, on up to 150
   accounts across eight social media platforms. Some users who tried to
   use the service Tuesday to automate follows, likes, and other actions
   said they were greeted with a strange error message. “I was thinking
   itʼs because instagram issues ppl had today,” wrote one user, who noted
   that Jarvee pushed out an update that morning. “I have the same issue
   on another bot,” wrote another. “Itʼs because of a instagram update Iʼd
   say.”

   In a message to WIRED, Jarvee said there was “nothing to worry about”
   and dismissed claims that Instagram’s crackdown had any effect on its
   services. A representative from Jarvee said that the service simulates
   traffic from Instagram’s iPhone app in order to fool the company into
   believing it’s a legitimate user. “Just make sure you donʼt do too many
   actions and make sure you make your account look as natural as
   possible,” wrote the Jarvee representative.

   Instagram fakery used to be much simpler. If you wanted more followers,
   you could visit one of the countless slightly sketchy sites offering
   them by the thousand, enter in your credit card details, and watch your
   follower count skyrocket. However, over the past few years, pulling off
   the sort of fraud capable of catapulting a user to genuine popularity
   has become much more difficult. Instagram’s decision to eschew the
   beloved chronological feed in favor of a more mysterious
   algorithmically ranked system left fraudsters scrambling for a
   workaround. Instagram hasn’t shared the specifics of how it ranks
   posts, but it’s clear that its new system prioritizes overall
   engagement—meaning likes, comments, story views, saves, mentions, and
   DMs.

   That has forced aspiring influencers and Insta-stars to take a
   multi-pronged approach to faking their followings. The most common
   methods over the past year or so fall into two main camps: automated
   engagement amplification services and pure paid fakery.

   As of Tuesday afternoon, followers, likes, comments, and story views
   apparently could still be bought from Social Media Marketing (SMM)
   panels, online vendors that use an automated fleet of accounts—or in
   some cases, real people controlling dozens of sock-puppet accounts—to
   provide clients with fake engagement.

   “There is a huge market around this and a huge percentage of
   ‘influencers’ who use these services because they’re so cheap,” says
   Eyal. As of Monday evening, the going rate on one popular panel, SM
   Garden, was $3 to acquire 1,000 followers, $1.80 for 1,000 likes, $1.20
   per 1,000 video views, $1.20 per 1,000 random comments in English, or
   $3 per 1,000 comments with emoji.

   These services may be popular, Eyal says, but they are rarely very
   sophisticated and are pretty easy to spot. They follow and unfollow
   random accounts en masse, post stock photos and images scraped from
   real users, and are often associated with unusual IP addresses. And
   those are just the signs visible to outsiders. Instagram itself has
   access to a wealth of data far beyond what is publicly available, like
   the specific software or application used to make the posts, the timing
   of behavior, and similarities in captions, bios, comments, or posted
   photos.

   Despite this wealth of identifying information, SMM panels continue to
   be popular among users. Instagram’s crackdown on inauthenticity doesn’t
   appear to have affected these accounts yet, and panel companies seem
   relatively well prepared for the challenge. In a message to WIRED, one
   of the administrators behind SM Garden said that the company was aware
   of Instagram’s policy update. The admin said that though SM Garden
   couldn’t predict the future, it always “make [sic] sure that our
   services are closely look real as possible.” SM Garden did not respond
   to questions about the status of its Instagram services currently, but
   the site’s “news feed,” which provides minute to minute updates on the
   availability of its offerings, did not indicate any issues.

How Much Screen Time Should My Kids Get?

Youʼre not really looking for the answer. Youʼre looking for absolution.

   Hotlittlepotato

     Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer questions about your interactions
     with technology.

   Q: How much screen time should my kids get?

   A: Friend, you can look up the answer to this question as well as I
   can. The American Academy of Pediatrics website spells it out for you:
   No screen time for kids under about two, no more than an hour a day for
   kids between two and five. Kids should have limits and “high quality”
   media, and you should make a habit of watching videos / playing games
   with them. Talk to your kids about porn. (Sorry.)

   But you did not come here because you don’t know how to google things.
   You came here because you know that many Silicon Valley types—the very
   inventors of these autoplaying crack slabs—don’t let their kids have
   any screen time at all. And maybe you aspire to that, much the way one
   aspires to be other impossible, implausible things, like a Kardashian.
   Or a monk.

   Also, you have sometimes—maybe often!—let your kids watch non-high
   quality shows (hands up whose kid watches Oggy and the Cockroaches).
   And maybe you feel like you use the iPad as a babysitter, and you feel
   guilty about that, and perhaps you have come here to seek absolution.

   I absolve you. Mostly.

   First, let’s consider the back-to-the-landline types who are
   interdicting or severely limiting their kids’ screen time because that
   shit is way addictive. I wouldn’t mind being able to be that parent,
   much the same way that I wouldn’t mind being able to be the crunchy
   homeschooling mom who teaches her kids trigonometry by building a
   chicken coop and gives them their own hydrometer so they can use it to
   test the homebrew kombucha.

   I am not that, and you are probably not that, either, if you are
   reading this. You and me, we have to go to work and do the dishes and
   make the sandwiches for lunch and volunteer at the school renaming
   voting booth tomorrow morning and the boys are lovely but they are so
   high energy that if you turn your back for one second to try to open
   the jar of mayonnaise, they’re immediately on each other, fighting over
   the rope that they want to use to lash the cat to the bannister, which
   is good for the cat because he gets away in the ensuing scuffle, but
   also now you cannot even remember what a sandwich IS your cortisol
   levels are so high from all the screeching in the background but then
   thank Christ, the clock strikes 6 and it’s time for TV and suddenly the
   house falls silent and you don’t feel like stabbing the mayonnaise jar
   with the spatula spreader any more, but you just give the lid a little
   twist and off it pops. You make the sandwiches.

   That is what screen time is for, that. To give you a bit of breathing
   room, whether it’s Wednesday night or a weekend morning. Don’t give me
   this crap about how it’s not to be used as a babysitter. It is a
   wonderful babysitter. (A corollary to this: A wonderful babysitter
   sticks to the shows you have approved. If you leave your kid watching
   Peppa Pig on YouTube and you come back and they’re watching one of
   those weird off-brand Peppa-the-Decapitated-Nazi Pig things, then
   adjust your household media consumption strategy.) But, imagine that
   this wonderful babysitter is very very expensive. You can’t use it all
   the time. Because you lose something every time you do—you have
   displaced some meaningful activity. Which is ok! Not every moment is a
   learning experience. But screens are definitely the carb of life
   experiences, and probably high-fructose-corn-syrup–containing carbs at
   that. Don’t go overboard.

   And you must not let your precious darlings use screens outside
   whatever window you pre-determine. That’s the main thing, really. If
   you ever ever give in to screens outside the pre-determined time, you
   are absolutely finished. The expensive babysitter who turned your
   chaotic house into a blissful cone of silence will morph into a large
   and perhaps slightly snappish dog who, since you have fed it once from
   the table, hounds you relentlessly all day for more episodes of
   Wonderpets. If the background subviolent sibling rivalry drove you mad,
   the weasely nagging directed straight at you will drive you off a
   cliff.

   Which is to say: Your kids are going to watch screens. You are going to
   feel a little guilty about it. That’s ok. But set your limits (1 hour
   after dinner, 2 in the morning on the weekends, iPads on a trip longer
   than 4 hours is what works for us—your needs may differ) and never,
   ever, ever exceed them.

   And you, fellow parent? How much time are you spending on your phone in
   the house, scrolling pointlessly through Instagram? Maybe set some
   limits on yourself, as well.

Hey Alexa, What Are You Doing to My Kidʼs Brain?

The new Echo Dot Kids edition encourages kids to be polite, but psychologists
and ethicists want parents to ask deeper questions than will Alexa make my
kid a jerk?

   Amazon

   Among the more modern anxieties of parents today is how virtual
   assistants will train their children to act. The fear is that kids who
   habitually order Amazonʼs Alexa to read them a story or command
   Googleʼs Assistant to tell them a joke are learning to communicate not
   as polite, considerate citizens, but as demanding little twerps.

   This worry has become so widespread that Amazon and Google both
   announced this week that their voice assistants can now encourage kids
   to punctuate their requests with "please." The version of Alexa that
   inhabits the new Echo Dot Kids Edition will thank children for "asking
   so nicely." Google Assistantʼs forthcoming Pretty Please feature will
   remind kids to "say the magic word" before complying with their wishes.

   But many psychologists think kids being polite to virtual assistants is
   less of an issue than parents think—and may even be a red herring. As
   virtual assistants become increasingly capable, conversational, and
   prevalent (assistant-embodied devices are forecasted to outnumber
   humans), psychologists and ethicists are asking deeper, more subtle
   questions than will Alexa make my kid bossy? And they want parents to
   do the same.

   "When I built my first virtual child, I got a lot of pushback and
   flak," recalls developmental psychologist Justine Cassell, director
   emeritus of Carnegie Mellonʼs Human-Computer Interaction Institute and
   an expert in the development of AI interfaces for children. It was the
   early aughts, and Cassell, then at MIT, was studying whether a
   life-sized, animated kid named Sam could help flesh-and-blood children
   hone their cognitive, social, and behavioral skills. "Critics worried
   that the kids would lose track of what was real and what was pretend,"
   Cassell says. "That theyʼd no longer be able to tell the difference
   between virtual children and actual ones."

   But when you asked the kids whether Sam was a real child, theyʼd roll
   their eyes. Of course Sam isnʼt real, theyʼd say. There was zero
   ambiguity.

   Nobody knows for sure, and Cassell emphasizes that the question
   deserves study, but she suspects todayʼs children will grow up
   similarly attuned to the virtual nature of our device-dwelling digital
   sidekicks—and, by extension, the context in which they do or do not
   need to be polite. Kids excel, she says, at dividing the world into
   categories. As long as they continue to separate humans from machines,
   she says, thereʼs no need to worry. "Because isn’t that actually what
   we want children to learn—not that everything that has a voice should
   be thanked, but that people have feelings?"

   Point taken. But what about Duplex, I ask, Googleʼs new human-sounding,
   phone calling AI? Well, Cassell says, that complicates matters. When
   you canʼt tell if a voice belongs to a human or a machine, she says,
   perhaps itʼs best to assume youʼre talking to a person, to avoid
   hurting a humanʼs feelings. But the real issue there isnʼt politeness,
   itʼs disclosure; artificial intelligences should be designed to
   identify themselves as such.

   Whatʼs more, the implications of a kid interacting with an AI extend
   far deeper than whether she recognizes it as non-human. "Of course
   parents worry about these devices reinforcing negative behaviors,
   whether itʼs being sassy or teasing a virtual assistant,” says Jenny
   Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at the University of
   Michigan and co-author of the latest guidelines for media use from the
   American Academy of Pediatrics. “But I think there are bigger questions
   surrounding things like kids’ cognitive development—the way they
   consume information and build knowledge.”

   Consider, for example, that the way kids interact with virtual
   assistants may not actual help them learn. This advertisement for the
   Echo Dot Kids Edition ends with a girl asking her smart speaker the
   distance to the Andromeda Galaxy. As the camera zooms out, we hear
   Alexa rattle off the answer: "The Andromeda Galaxy is 14 quintillion,
   931 quadrillion, 389 trillion, 517 billion, 400 million miles away":

   To parents it might register as a neat feature. Alexa knows answers to
   questions that you donʼt! But most kids donʼt learn by simply receiving
   information. "Learning happens happens when a child is challenged,"
   Cassell says, "by a parent, by another child, a teacher—and they can
   argue back and forth."

   Virtual assistants canʼt do that yet, which highlights the importance
   of parents using smart devices with their kids. At least for the time
   being. Our digital butlers could be capable of brain-building banter
   sooner than you think.

   This week, Google announced its smart speakers will remain activated
   several seconds after you issue a command, allowing you to engage in
   continuous conversation without repeating "Hey, Google," or "OK,
   Google." For now, the feature will allow your virtual assistant to keep
   track of contextually dependent follow-up questions. (If you ask what
   movies George Clooney has starred in and then ask how tall he his,
   Google Assistant will recognize that "he" is in reference to George
   Clooney.) Itʼs a far cry from a dialectic exchange, but it charts a
   clear path toward more conversational forms of inquiry and learning.

   And, perhaps, something even more. "I think itʼs reasonable to ask if
   parenting will become a skill that, like Go or chess, is better
   performed by a machine," says John Havens, executive director of the
   the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent
   Systems. "What do we do if a kid starts saying Look, I appreciate the
   parents in my house, because they put me on the map, biologically. But
   dad tells a lot of lame dad jokes. And mom is kind of a helicopter
   parent. And I really prefer the knowledge, wisdom, and insight given to
   me by my devices."

   Havens jokes that he sounds paranoid, because heʼs speculating about
   what-if scenarios from the future. But what about the more near-term?
   If you start handing duties over to the machine, how do you take them
   back the day your kid decides Alexa is a higher authority than you are
   on, say, trigonometry?

   Other experts I spoke with agreed itʼs not too early for parents to
   begin thinking deeply about the long-term implications of raising kids
   in the company of virtual assistants. "I think these tools can be
   awesome, and provide quick fixes to situations that involve answering
   questions and telling stories that parents might not always have time
   for," Radesky says. "But I also want parents to consider how that might
   come to displace some of the experiences they enjoy sharing with kids."

   Other things Radesky, Cassell, and Havens think parents should
   consider: The extent to which kids understand privacy issues related to
   internet-connected toys, how their children interact with devices at
   their friendsʼ houses, and what information other familyʼs devices
   should be permitted to collect about their kids. In other words, how do
   children conceptualize the algorithms that serve up facts and
   entertainment, learn about them, and potentially profit from them?

   "The fact is, very few of us sit down and talk with our kids about the
   social constructs surrounding robots and virtual assistants," Radesky
   says.

   Perhaps that—more than whether their children says "please" and "thank
   you" to the smart speaker in the living room—is what parents should be
   thinking about.

Coming of Age in the Digital Age:

     * Privacy is paramount. Here are the A-B-Cs of keeping your kids safe
       online.
     * Not all screen time (or voice assistant time) is created equal.

Big Tech: Breaking Us Up Will Only Help China

Amid escalating tension with China, executives at Google and Facebook argue
that tough regulations against tech will hurt US competitiveness.

   Thereʼs "a concern in the United States with the size and power of
   Chinese companies," Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said.
   LINO MIRGELER/AFP/Getty Images

   Over the past week, both Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl
   Sandberg and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt made the same appeal to
   American nationalism, with differing degrees of subtlety: Breaking up
   Big Tech will only help China.

   It’s a politically expedient plea as calls for regulating tech
   intensify amid growing concern about China’s tech prowess and an
   escalating US-China trade war. But the argument rests on the idea that
   what’s good for Facebook and Google is good for America. It also
   ignores how Silicon Valley is simultaneously seeking growth through
   partnerships with some of those same Chinese competitors, such as
   Google’s investment in JD.com and reported talks with Tencent to bring
   Google Cloud to China.

   Sandberg made her case against breaking up Facebook explicit. In an
   interview Friday, CNBC asked if Facebook was prepping for a big
   antitrust battle. In response, Sandberg recounted recent private
   meetings with Democrats and Republicans in Washington. There, she said,
   she heard that “while people are concerned with the size and power of
   tech companies, there’s also a concern in the United States with the
   size and power of Chinese companies, and the realization that these
   companies are not going to be broken up.”

   Schmidt was less direct but conjured the same fears of falling behind
   China. On Sunday he told the The Telegraph there is no legal basis to
   break up tech companies, arguing that “regulatory bias” in the West
   against Google and other American firms hurts consumers and hands China
   a competitive advantage on everything from privacy to data collection.
   "Chinese companies are growing faster, they have higher valuations, and
   they have more users than their non-Chinese counterparts," said
   Schmidt, who will step down from Alphabet’s board in June. "It’s very
   important to understand that there is a global competition around
   technology innovation, and China is a significant player and likely to
   remain so.”

   Google and Facebook declined to respond to questions from WIRED.

   Mark Zuckerberg, who reportedly offered to let President Xi name his
   first-born child, laid the groundwork for this strategy during a
   congressional hearing last year. Asked if Facebook was too powerful,
   Zuckerberg rerouted the conversation toward Chinese internet companies.
   He said American tech policymakers “should be thinking about” those
   companies because they pose “a real strategic and competitive threat.”
   (Zuckerberg even spelled out the China defense in his notes for the
   hearing, photographed by the Associated Press, which included the line
   “Break up FB? US tech companies key asset for America; break up
   strengthens Chinese companies.”)

   It’s not a new line. Dominant companies and their defenders have made
   the same argument for decades. In the late 20th century, some argued
   that Japan’s rising power was a bigger economic threat than
   anticompetitive practices by Microsoft or IBM. In March, both Qualcomm
   and Apple used Washington’s fear of falling behind China in 5G to plead
   their case in a bitter fight with each other over patent royalties.

   But this appeal to American nationalism has been getting more play
   recently as the on-again, off-again trade war with China appears to be
   back on. Nicol Turner-Lee, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s
   Center for Technology Innovation, says concern about falling behind
   China is valid, especially in regards to artificial intelligence and
   advanced 5G wireless networks. But, she adds, the China defense is
   among the few plausible arguments Big Tech can bring before Congress
   right now. “They can’t say, ‘We know we’re allowing people to mess with
   our elections, but don’t break us up. We’re good for democracy, don’t
   break us up,’” she says.

   Turner-Lee says American legislators don’t necessarily want to
   intervene in tech company operations, but they want tech companies to
   behave responsibly and clarify their relationship with Chinese
   companies around data security, surveillance, and other
   vulnerabilities. Regulators probably looked kindly on Google, for
   instance, for adhering to the US government’s new sanctions against the
   Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei; on Monday, the ban was delayed
   90 days, allowing Google to send security patches and updates to
   existing Android-based Huawei devices.

   Some US antitrust officials sound unmoved by the China card. “America
   doesn’t become competitive by propping up politically connected tech
   companies, we compete by making sure the best ideas can come from
   anywhere and anybody,” Rohit Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal
   Trade Commission, told WIRED. Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice
   Department’s Antitrust Division, recently spoke out against the idea of
   “national champions.” In March he congratulated the EU for blocking a
   rail-manufacturing merger. “Obviously there’s national security and
   other considerations that factor in, but with respect to that [merger],
   creating a national champion even if you would harm consumers is not
   the way to do it,” Delrahim said.

   When WIRED asked Facebook whether Sandberg initiated concerns about
   China during her meetings in Washington, a spokesperson for Facebook
   pointed WIRED to recent comments from members of Congress, to show that
   legislators are also concerned. Representative Ro Khanna
   (D-California), who represents Silicon Valley, has called for greater
   regulation and antitrust scrutiny of the sector. But he recently told
   The Hill that regulators should be cautious. “Look, what we donʼt want
   is the only big tech companies to be Chinese—Alibaba, Baidu and
   Tencent.” In early April, Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) told CNBC
   that if regulators were to “chop off the legs of Facebook and Google,”
   then those companies “might be replaced by Alibaba, Baidu,
   Tencent—companies that are totally enmeshed with the Chinese government
   in their global economic plan.” A spokesperson for Warner declined to
   comment, beyond standing by his statements.

   “I don’t think competition with China means, in any way, that we give
   tech a pass from antitrust enforcement,” Khanna told WIRED by email.
   “What it does mean is that we need to be nuanced and strategic in how
   we strongly enforce antitrust law and not reflexively call for breakups
   of a company just because it’s big.”

   Khanna said US tech companies should work with US officials to protect
   American interests as they try to compete in China. “US tech companies
   have an obligation to help the United States and not to help the
   Chinese advance their surveillance state,” he wrote.

   Economic policies that seek to prop up homegrown companies as “national
   champions” have a bad track record, says Columbia Law School professor
   Tim Wu, author of The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded
   Age. The fact that regulators did not hold back on IBM, AT&T, and
   Microsoft “helped us ensure a generation of American supremacy in tech.
   Frankly, the fact that Japan never took on their monopolists ended up
   hurting them,” Wu told American Conservative last year. “I do accept
   and understand that there are advantages to scale, but there is a point
   where the advantages of scale run out. There are disadvantages to
   scale, and I think there’s a difference between scale and monopoly.”

Instagram’s Crackdown on Fake Followers Just Might Work

   Instagram's promise to root out "inauthentic activity" sends some
   social media marketers into crisis.

   Instagrams Crackdown on Fake Followers Just Might Work

   Instagram Monday said it would again crack down on users who pursue
   “inauthentic activity” to boost an account’s popularity. Within hours,
   BlackHatWorld, a forum popular with self-proclaimed “black hat” social
   media marketers, was in crisis.

   In a section of the forum usually reserved for sharing the best deals
   on obtaining fake Instagram followers, concerned users started at least
   13 threads to discuss the policy change. “The beginning of the end?”
   asked one user. “It’s happening,” wrote another, posting a link to
   Instagram’s press release, which promised to “begin removing
   inauthentic likes, follows and comments from accounts that use
   third-party apps to boost their popularity.” BlackHatWorld users
   squabbled long into the night over the extent of Instagram’s purge. By
   Tuesday afternoon, several threads had descended into chaos.
   Applications had already started to go offline. It was an illicit
   growth hacker’s worst nightmare—suggesting that this time, perhaps,
   Instagram might actually be on to something.

   Likes, comments, and followers are the currency of Instagram. They are
   the metrics by which we determine a profile’s worth or an idea’s
   popularity, but they can be difficult to amass. From this stems their
   power. An account with tens of thousands of followers inherently seems
   more legitimate, and trustworthy, than one with three. When an account
   reaches 10,000 followers, it’s granted access to one of Instagram’s
   most coveted features: the ability to embed links in Instagram Stories.
   For a relatively link-averse platform like Instagram, the feature is a
   big deal and could be used to drive traffic to a particular site or
   brand. For influencers, who make all or part of their living promoting
   products through Instagram, the stakes are even higher. Payments for
   these deals are determined based on perceived reach, so a higher
   follower count often translates directly into a significantly higher
   paycheck.

   Unlike its real-life counterpart, however, digital popularity can be
   bought in minutes. Engagement manipulation has long plagued platforms
   like YouTube and Twitter, and Instagram is no different. Wannabe
   influencers, new companies, and scammers alike often turn to these
   services to get their profiles off the ground; when done right, fake
   engagement begets real engagement.

   Instagram’s new policy is aimed most squarely at so-called automated
   amplification services. Almost all of these apps require a user to pay
   a subscription fee and turn over their Instagram login credentials, a
   direct violation of the platform’s terms of service and a clear
   security risk. The applications use the credentials to send the user’s
   profile into an automated frenzy of likes, comments, and follows, in an
   attempt to get real users to follow the client’s profile.

   In its announcement, Instagram said that with the help of machine
   learning, it had identified users who had shared their login
   credentials with such services and that it would offer those users an
   ultimatum: Change your password immediately to revoke the service’s
   access to your account, or see your Instagram experience “impacted.”
   Instagram did not respond to multiple requests for additional comment.

   “Many influencers and regular users use these tools to create perceived
   growth in their audience and to appear more successful than they are,”
   Gil Eyal, CEO of Hypr Brands, an influencer marketing company that
   specializes in rooting out fake followers from real ones, told WIRED
   over email.

   As of Tuesday afternoon, a number of BlackHatters reported experiencing
   issues with Jarvee, one of the most recommended Instagram automation
   apps on the forum. In exchange for a subscription fee ranging from
   about $20 to $70 a month, Jarvee lets users automate multiple in-app
   actions, from follows to DMs to reposts and beyond, on up to 150
   accounts across eight social media platforms. Some users who tried to
   use the service Tuesday to automate follows, likes, and other actions
   said they were greeted with a strange error message. “I was thinking
   it's because instagram issues ppl had today,” wrote one user, who noted
   that Jarvee pushed out an update that morning. “I have the same issue
   on another bot,” wrote another. “It's because of a instagram update I'd
   say.”

   In a message to WIRED, Jarvee said there was “nothing to worry about”
   and dismissed claims that Instagram’s crackdown had any effect on its
   services. A representative from Jarvee said that the service simulates
   traffic from Instagram’s iPhone app in order to fool the company into
   believing it’s a legitimate user. “Just make sure you don't do too many
   actions and make sure you make your account look as natural as
   possible,” wrote the Jarvee representative.

   Instagram fakery used to be much simpler. If you wanted more followers,
   you could visit one of the countless slightly sketchy sites offering
   them by the thousand, enter in your credit card details, and watch your
   follower count skyrocket. However, over the past few years, pulling off
   the sort of fraud capable of catapulting a user to genuine popularity
   has become much more difficult. Instagram’s decision to eschew the
   beloved chronological feed in favor of a more mysterious
   algorithmically ranked system left fraudsters scrambling for a
   workaround. Instagram hasn’t shared the specifics of how it ranks
   posts, but it’s clear that its new system prioritizes overall
   engagement—meaning likes, comments, story views, saves, mentions, and
   DMs.

   That has forced aspiring influencers and Insta-stars to take a
   multi-pronged approach to faking their followings. The most common
   methods over the past year or so fall into two main camps: automated
   engagement amplification services and pure paid fakery.

   As of Tuesday afternoon, followers, likes, comments, and story views
   apparently could still be bought from Social Media Marketing (SMM)
   panels, online vendors that use an automated fleet of accounts—or in
   some cases, real people controlling dozens of sock-puppet accounts—to
   provide clients with fake engagement.

   “There is a huge market around this and a huge percentage of
   ‘influencers’ who use these services because they’re so cheap,” says
   Eyal. As of Monday evening, the going rate on one popular panel, SM
   Garden, was $3 to acquire 1,000 followers, $1.80 for 1,000 likes, $1.20
   per 1,000 video views, $1.20 per 1,000 random comments in English, or
   $3 per 1,000 comments with emoji.

   These services may be popular, Eyal says, but they are rarely very
   sophisticated and are pretty easy to spot. They follow and unfollow
   random accounts en masse, post stock photos and images scraped from
   real users, and are often associated with unusual IP addresses. And
   those are just the signs visible to outsiders. Instagram itself has
   access to a wealth of data far beyond what is publicly available, like
   the specific software or application used to make the posts, the timing
   of behavior, and similarities in captions, bios, comments, or posted
   photos.

   Despite this wealth of identifying information, SMM panels continue to
   be popular among users. Instagram’s crackdown on inauthenticity doesn’t
   appear to have affected these accounts yet, and panel companies seem
   relatively well prepared for the challenge. In a message to WIRED, one
   of the administrators behind SM Garden said that the company was aware
   of Instagram’s policy update. The admin said that though SM Garden
   couldn’t predict the future, it always “make [sic] sure that our
   services are closely look real as possible.” SM Garden did not respond
   to questions about the status of its Instagram services currently, but
   the site’s “news feed,” which provides minute to minute updates on the
   availability of its offerings, did not indicate any issues.

How Much Screen Time Should My Kids Get?

   You're not really looking for the answer. You're looking for
   absolution.

   How Much Screen Time Should My Kids Get Hotlittlepotato
     *
     *
     *

   Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer questions about your interactions with
   technology.

   Q: How much screen time should my kids get?

   A: Friend, you can look up the answer to this question as well as I
   can. The American Academy of Pediatrics website spells it out for you:
   No screen time for kids under about two, no more than an hour a day for
   kids between two and five. Kids should have limits and “high quality”
   media, and you should make a habit of watching videos / playing games
   with them. Talk to your kids about porn. (Sorry.)

   But you did not come here because you don’t know how to google things.
   You came here because you know that many Silicon Valley types—the very
   inventors of these autoplaying crack slabs—don’t let their kids have
   any screen time at all. And maybe you aspire to that, much the way one
   aspires to be other impossible, implausible things, like a Kardashian.
   Or a monk.

   Also, you have sometimes—maybe often!—let your kids watch non-high
   quality shows (hands up whose kid watches Oggy and the Cockroaches).
   And maybe you feel like you use the iPad as a babysitter, and you feel
   guilty about that, and perhaps you have come here to seek absolution.

   I absolve you. Mostly.

   First, let’s consider the back-to-the-landline types who are
   interdicting or severely limiting their kids’ screen time because that
   shit is way addictive. I wouldn’t mind being able to be that parent,
   much the same way that I wouldn’t mind being able to be the crunchy
   homeschooling mom who teaches her kids trigonometry by building a
   chicken coop and gives them their own hydrometer so they can use it to
   test the homebrew kombucha.

   I am not that, and you are probably not that, either, if you are
   reading this. You and me, we have to go to work and do the dishes and
   make the sandwiches for lunch and volunteer at the school renaming
   voting booth tomorrow morning and the boys are lovely but they are so
   high energy that if you turn your back for one second to try to open
   the jar of mayonnaise, they’re immediately on each other, fighting over
   the rope that they want to use to lash the cat to the bannister, which
   is good for the cat because he gets away in the ensuing scuffle, but
   also now you cannot even remember what a sandwich IS your cortisol
   levels are so high from all the screeching in the background but then
   thank Christ, the clock strikes 6 and it’s time for TV and suddenly the
   house falls silent and you don’t feel like stabbing the mayonnaise jar
   with the spatula spreader any more, but you just give the lid a little
   twist and off it pops. You make the sandwiches.

   That is what screen time is for, that. To give you a bit of breathing
   room, whether it’s Wednesday night or a weekend morning. Don’t give me
   this crap about how it’s not to be used as a babysitter. It is a
   wonderful babysitter. (A corollary to this: A wonderful babysitter
   sticks to the shows you have approved. If you leave your kid watching
   Peppa Pig on YouTube and you come back and they’re watching one of
   those weird off-brand Peppa-the-Decapitated-Nazi Pig things, then
   adjust your household media consumption strategy.) But, imagine that
   this wonderful babysitter is very very expensive. You can’t use it all
   the time. Because you lose something every time you do—you have
   displaced some meaningful activity. Which is ok! Not every moment is a
   learning experience. But screens are definitely the carb of life
   experiences, and probably high-fructose-corn-syrup–containing carbs at
   that. Don’t go overboard.

   And you must not let your precious darlings use screens outside
   whatever window you pre-determine. That’s the main thing, really. If
   you ever ever give in to screens outside the pre-determined time, you
   are absolutely finished. The expensive babysitter who turned your
   chaotic house into a blissful cone of silence will morph into a large
   and perhaps slightly snappish dog who, since you have fed it once from
   the table, hounds you relentlessly all day for more episodes of
   Wonderpets. If the background subviolent sibling rivalry drove you mad,
   the weasely nagging directed straight at you will drive you off a
   cliff.

   Which is to say: Your kids are going to watch screens. You are going to
   feel a little guilty about it. That’s ok. But set your limits (1 hour
   after dinner, 2 in the morning on the weekends, iPads on a trip longer
   than 4 hours is what works for us—your needs may differ) and never,
   ever, ever exceed them.

   And you, fellow parent? How much time are you spending on your phone in
   the house, scrolling pointlessly through Instagram? Maybe set some
   limits on yourself, as well.

   The new Echo Dot Kids edition encourages kids to be polite, but
   psychologists and ethicists want parents to ask deeper questions than
   will Alexa make my kid a jerk?

   Among the more modern anxieties of parents today is how virtual
   assistants will train their children to act. The fear is that kids who
   habitually order Amazon's Alexa to read them a story or command
   Google's Assistant to tell them a joke are learning to communicate not
   as polite, considerate citizens, but as demanding little twerps.

   This worry has become so widespread that Amazon and Google both
   announced this week that their voice assistants can now encourage kids
   to punctuate their requests with "please." The version of Alexa that
   inhabits the new Echo Dot Kids Edition will thank children for "asking
   so nicely." Google Assistant's forthcoming Pretty Please feature will
   remind kids to "say the magic word" before complying with their wishes.

   But many psychologists think kids being polite to virtual assistants is
   less of an issue than parents think—and may even be a red herring. As
   virtual assistants become increasingly capable, conversational, and
   prevalent (assistant-embodied devices are forecasted to outnumber
   humans), psychologists and ethicists are asking deeper, more subtle
   questions than will Alexa make my kid bossy? And they want parents to
   do the same.

   "When I built my first virtual child, I got a lot of pushback and
   flak," recalls developmental psychologist Justine Cassell, director
   emeritus of Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute and
   an expert in the development of AI interfaces for children. It was the
   early aughts, and Cassell, then at MIT, was studying whether a
   life-sized, animated kid named Sam could help flesh-and-blood children
   hone their cognitive, social, and behavioral skills. "Critics worried
   that the kids would lose track of what was real and what was pretend,"
   Cassell says. "That they'd no longer be able to tell the difference
   between virtual children and actual ones."

   But when you asked the kids whether Sam was a real child, they'd roll
   their eyes. Of course Sam isn't real, they'd say. There was zero
   ambiguity.

   Nobody knows for sure, and Cassell emphasizes that the question
   deserves study, but she suspects today's children will grow up
   similarly attuned to the virtual nature of our device-dwelling digital
   sidekicks—and, by extension, the context in which they do or do not
   need to be polite. Kids excel, she says, at dividing the world into
   categories. As long as they continue to separate humans from machines,
   she says, there's no need to worry. "Because isn’t that actually what
   we want children to learn—not that everything that has a voice should
   be thanked, but that people have feelings?"

   Point taken. But what about Duplex, I ask, Google's new human-sounding,
   phone calling AI? Well, Cassell says, that complicates matters. When
   you can't tell if a voice belongs to a human or a machine, she says,
   perhaps it's best to assume you're talking to a person, to avoid
   hurting a human's feelings. But the real issue there isn't politeness,
   it's disclosure; artificial intelligences should be designed to
   identify themselves as such.

   What's more, the implications of a kid interacting with an AI extend
   far deeper than whether she recognizes it as non-human. "Of course
   parents worry about these devices reinforcing negative behaviors,
   whether it's being sassy or teasing a virtual assistant,” says Jenny
   Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at the University of
   Michigan and co-author of the latest guidelines for media use from the
   American Academy of Pediatrics. “But I think there are bigger questions
   surrounding things like kids’ cognitive development—the way they
   consume information and build knowledge.”

   Consider, for example, that the way kids interact with virtual
   assistants may not actual help them learn. This advertisement for the
   Echo Dot Kids Edition ends with a girl asking her smart speaker the
   distance to the Andromeda Galaxy. As the camera zooms out, we hear
   Alexa rattle off the answer: "The Andromeda Galaxy is 14 quintillion,
   931 quadrillion, 389 trillion, 517 billion, 400 million miles away":

   To parents it might register as a neat feature. Alexa knows answers to
   questions that you don't! But most kids don't learn by simply receiving
   information. "Learning happens happens when a child is challenged,"
   Cassell says, "by a parent, by another child, a teacher—and they can
   argue back and forth."

   Virtual assistants can't do that yet, which highlights the importance
   of parents using smart devices with their kids. At least for the time
   being. Our digital butlers could be capable of brain-building banter
   sooner than you think.

   This week, Google announced its smart speakers will remain activated
   several seconds after you issue a command, allowing you to engage in
   continuous conversation without repeating "Hey, Google," or "OK,
   Google." For now, the feature will allow your virtual assistant to keep
   track of contextually dependent follow-up questions. (If you ask what
   movies George Clooney has starred in and then ask how tall he his,
   Google Assistant will recognize that "he" is in reference to George
   Clooney.) It's a far cry from a dialectic exchange, but it charts a
   clear path toward more conversational forms of inquiry and learning.

   And, perhaps, something even more. "I think it's reasonable to ask if
   parenting will become a skill that, like Go or chess, is better
   performed by a machine," says John Havens, executive director of the
   the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent
   Systems. "What do we do if a kid starts saying Look, I appreciate the
   parents in my house, because they put me on the map, biologically. But
   dad tells a lot of lame dad jokes. And mom is kind of a helicopter
   parent. And I really prefer the knowledge, wisdom, and insight given to
   me by my devices."

   Havens jokes that he sounds paranoid, because he's speculating about
   what-if scenarios from the future. But what about the more near-term?
   If you start handing duties over to the machine, how do you take them
   back the day your kid decides Alexa is a higher authority than you are
   on, say, trigonometry?

   Other experts I spoke with agreed it's not too early for parents to
   begin thinking deeply about the long-term implications of raising kids
   in the company of virtual assistants. "I think these tools can be
   awesome, and provide quick fixes to situations that involve answering
   questions and telling stories that parents might not always have time
   for," Radesky says. "But I also want parents to consider how that might
   come to displace some of the experiences they enjoy sharing with kids."

   Other things Radesky, Cassell, and Havens think parents should
   consider: The extent to which kids understand privacy issues related to
   internet-connected toys, how their children interact with devices at
   their friends' houses, and what information other family's devices
   should be permitted to collect about their kids. In other words, how do
   children conceptualize the algorithms that serve up facts and
   entertainment, learn about them, and potentially profit from them?

   "The fact is, very few of us sit down and talk with our kids about the
   social constructs surrounding robots and virtual assistants," Radesky
   says.

   Perhaps that—more than whether their children says "please" and "thank
   you" to the smart speaker in the living room—is what parents should be
   thinking about.

Coming of Age in the Digital Age:

     * Privacy is paramount. Here are the A-B-Cs of keeping your kids safe
       online.
     * Not all screen time (or voice assistant time) is created equal.
       Here's how kids can use time with tech to their advantage.
     * Your kids will look at internet porn. Deal with it.
