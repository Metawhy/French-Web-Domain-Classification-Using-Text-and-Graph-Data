Frequently Asked Questions

Useful Information and Answers for Our Visitors

   What is the minimum age for being able to participate?

   Four years old.

   Do minors have to be accompanied by an adult?

   Yes, they must be accompanied by an adult. Even though we have a tour
   guide, an adult must be personally responsible for any minors. However,
   if you wish to have a tour with a group of children, there can be a
   ratio of five children for every adult.

   Do you sell videos taken of each tour group?

   We do not sell videos, but we do take photographs of your tour. You can
   purchase these photos individually and we also sell CDs featuring many
   photos of your expedition including a few classic pictures of the
   nature reserve.

   Can I take a camera with me on the tour?

   In order to protect the safety of individuals, the group and the cave,
   you are not allowed to bring photography or video equipment into the
   caves, since you can slip or damage a natural structure while inside.
   However, you may use them outside the cave.

   During the expedition, we have professional photographic equipment and
   lighting inside the cave, which allows us to safely capture your
   adventure on film and deliver high quality photographs. Common cameras
   are barely able to generate a bright enough flash inside Río Secreto
   and they are unable to capture and illuminate the beauty and scope of
   the entire cave.

   Are there lockers available?

   Yes, we have lockers with keys, available to you at no extra cost.

   Can pregnant women participate in the tours ⁄ programs?

   Since this tour takes place inside caverns, the path is windy and the
   ground is hard limestone rock that can be a little slippery in some
   areas. Although it is not high impact, risky or arduous, for the safety
   of individual visitors as well as the group, we do not recommend the
   tour for pregnant women, nor for persons with claustrophobia, heart
   problems, difficulty walking.

   Is there a route that does not have stairs or one that suits people who
   have difficulty walking?No. Our goal is to leave the cave untouched and
   preserved in its natural state. The tour’s only path winds through
   rocky, natural formations.

   How thick is the wetsuit?

   It is 2.5 to 3 millimeters thick.

   If I don’t know how to swim, can I still take the tour?

   It is not required that you know how to swim. You only need to know how
   to float. The in-water portion of the tour is very brief and shallow.
   In addition, you will be aided by your life jacket and wetsuit, which
   help you stay afloat.

   What is the temperature of the water?

   The water is cool, with a temperature of 22º C to 24º C, or 69º F to
   75º F. However, our visitors wear neoprene wetsuits and life vests to
   keep them comfortable and help mitigate the brisk water temperature.

   What does the tour consist of?

   This is a one-of-a-kind, guided cave tour that includes a combination
   of walking and swimming.

   What happens if I want to go on the tour, but I have a child that is
   younger than the age in which they’re allowed to participate? Do you
   have someone who can take care of children who are too young to take
   the tour?

   In these cases, please ask Río Secreto in advance if there is someone
   who can care for your children, specifying the date and time in which
   the babysitter will be needed, this service has an additional cost.

   Isn’t the cost of the tour a little high, considering the amount of
   time that you’re in the cave?

   For the cost of the tour, you are given exclusive access to a
   scientific wonder and lead by expert guides who happily share their
   knowledge of the area. You will use high-quality equipment and follow
   well-maintained paths to allow for optimum safety and enjoyment. Our
   technically advanced photography system will take photos of you as you
   make your way through this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Rest assured,
   the cost includes many things to make your tour memorable and the
   amount of time you spend in the cave will absolutely fulfill your
   expectations.

   Is the cost of transportation very high?

   $109 USD includes the Río Secreto tour and transportation from Riviera
   Maya, but you can also get there on your own by taking public
   transportation and paying the admission fee of $79 USD . See the
   instructions, How do I get to Río Secreto?

   Should I arrive ahead of time for my tour?

   Yes, we recommend that you arrive at the nature reserve ticket office
   at least 20 minutes before the time your tour starts.

   Should I bring money for extra expenses?

   Really, there are no additional expenses inside the reserve. However,
   we recommend that you take along some cash for purchasing souvenirs,
   photographs and/or for tipping the guides.

   Do I need to bring sun protection?

   The tour takes place in the shade since you are inside the cave almost
   the entire time, so you are not really exposed to the sun. We also ask
   all visitors to take a quick shower before going into the cave in order
   to eliminate possible toxins – like lotions, makeup and hair gel – that
   could pollute the cave and harm its delicate ecosystem.

   How do I know what services are included and not included in my tour?

   To see what’s included, please visit the pages for the type of tour you
   prefer:
     * Admission fee only
     * Admission fee + transportation from Cancun
     * Admission fee + transportation from the Riviera Maya

   How can I get and / or recover my photos?

   to eliminate possible toxins – like lotions, makeup and hair gel – that
   could pollute the cave and harm its delicate ecosystem.

   prefer:

Frequently Asked Questions

Useful Information and Answers for Our Visitors

   What is the minimum age for being able to participate?

   Four years old.

   Do minors have to be accompanied by an adult?

   Yes, they must be accompanied by an adult. Even though we have a tour
   guide, an adult must be personally responsible for any minors. However,
   if you wish to have a tour with a group of children, there can be a
   ratio of five children for every adult.

   Do you sell videos taken of each tour group?

   We do not sell videos, but we do take photographs of your tour. You can
   purchase these photos individually and we also sell CDs featuring many
   photos of your expedition including a few classic pictures of the
   nature reserve.

   Can I take a camera with me on the tour?

   In order to protect the safety of individuals, the group and the cave,
   you are not allowed to bring photography or video equipment into the
   caves, since you can slip or damage a natural structure while inside.
   However, you may use them outside the cave.

   During the expedition, we have professional photographic equipment and
   lighting inside the cave, which allows us to safely capture your
   adventure on film and deliver high quality photographs. Common cameras
   are barely able to generate a bright enough flash inside Río Secreto
   and they are unable to capture and illuminate the beauty and scope of
   the entire cave.

   Are there lockers available?

   Yes, we have lockers with keys, available to you at no extra cost.

   Can pregnant women participate in the tours ⁄ programs?

   Since this tour takes place inside caverns, the path is windy and the
   ground is hard limestone rock that can be a little slippery in some
   areas. Although it is not high impact, risky or arduous, for the safety
   of individual visitors as well as the group, we do not recommend the
   tour for pregnant women, nor for persons with claustrophobia, heart
   problems, difficulty walking.

   Is there a route that does not have stairs or one that suits people who
   have difficulty walking?No. Our goal is to leave the cave untouched and
   preserved in its natural state. The tour’s only path winds through
   rocky, natural formations.

   How thick is the wetsuit?

   It is 2.5 to 3 millimeters thick.

   If I don’t know how to swim, can I still take the tour?

   It is not required that you know how to swim. You only need to know how
   to float. The in-water portion of the tour is very brief and shallow.
   In addition, you will be aided by your life jacket and wetsuit, which
   help you stay afloat.

   What is the temperature of the water?

   The water is cool, with a temperature of 22º C to 24º C, or 69º F to
   75º F. However, our visitors wear neoprene wetsuits and life vests to
   keep them comfortable and help mitigate the brisk water temperature.

   What does the tour consist of?

   This is a one-of-a-kind, guided cave tour that includes a combination
   of walking and swimming.

   What happens if I want to go on the tour, but I have a child that is
   younger than the age in which they’re allowed to participate? Do you
   have someone who can take care of children who are too young to take
   the tour?

   In these cases, please ask Río Secreto in advance if there is someone
   who can care for your children, specifying the date and time in which
   the babysitter will be needed, this service has an additional cost.

   Isn’t the cost of the tour a little high, considering the amount of
   time that you’re in the cave?

   For the cost of the tour, you are given exclusive access to a
   scientific wonder and lead by expert guides who happily share their
   knowledge of the area. You will use high-quality equipment and follow
   well-maintained paths to allow for optimum safety and enjoyment. Our
   technically advanced photography system will take photos of you as you
   make your way through this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Rest assured,
   the cost includes many things to make your tour memorable and the
   amount of time you spend in the cave will absolutely fulfill your
   expectations.

   Is the cost of transportation very high?

   $109 USD includes the Río Secreto tour and transportation from Riviera
   Maya, but you can also get there on your own by taking public
   transportation and paying the admission fee of $79 USD . See the
   instructions, How do I get to Río Secreto?

   Should I arrive ahead of time for my tour?

   Yes, we recommend that you arrive at the nature reserve ticket office
   at least 20 minutes before the time your tour starts.

   Should I bring money for extra expenses?

   Really, there are no additional expenses inside the reserve. However,
   we recommend that you take along some cash for purchasing souvenirs,
   photographs and/or for tipping the guides.

   Do I need to bring sun protection?

   The tour takes place in the shade since you are inside the cave almost
   the entire time, so you are not really exposed to the sun. We also ask
   all visitors to take a quick shower before going into the cave in order
   to eliminate possible toxins – like lotions, makeup and hair gel – that
   could pollute the cave and harm its delicate ecosystem.

   How do I know what services are included and not included in my tour?

   To see what’s included, please visit the pages for the type of tour you
   prefer:
     * Admission fee only

Frequently Asked Questions

Useful Information and Answers for Our Visitors

   What is the minimum age for being able to participate?

   Four years old.

   Do minors have to be accompanied by an adult?

   Yes, they must be accompanied by an adult. Even though we have a tour
   guide, an adult must be personally responsible for any minors. However,
   if you wish to have a tour with a group of children, there can be a
   ratio of five children for every adult.

   Do you sell videos taken of each tour group?

   We do not sell videos, but we do take photographs of your tour. You can
   purchase these photos individually and we also sell CDs featuring many
   photos of your expedition including a few classic pictures of the
   nature reserve.

   Can I take a camera with me on the tour?

   In order to protect the safety of individuals, the group and the cave,
   you are not allowed to bring photography or video equipment into the
   caves, since you can slip or damage a natural structure while inside.
   However, you may use them outside the cave.

   During the expedition, we have professional photographic equipment and
   lighting inside the cave, which allows us to safely capture your
   adventure on film and deliver high quality photographs. Common cameras
   are barely able to generate a bright enough flash inside Río Secreto
   and they are unable to capture and illuminate the beauty and scope of
   the entire cave.

   Are there lockers available?

   Yes, we have lockers with keys, available to you at no extra cost.

   Can pregnant women participate in the tours ⁄ programs?

   Since this tour takes place inside caverns, the path is windy and the
   ground is hard limestone rock that can be a little slippery in some
   areas. Although it is not high impact, risky or arduous, for the safety
   of individual visitors as well as the group, we do not recommend the
   tour for pregnant women, nor for persons with claustrophobia, heart
   problems, difficulty walking.

   Is there a route that does not have stairs or one that suits people who
   have difficulty walking?No. Our goal is to leave the cave untouched and
   preserved in its natural state. The tour’s only path winds through
   rocky, natural formations.

   How thick is the wetsuit?

   It is 2.5 to 3 millimeters thick.

   If I don’t know how to swim, can I still take the tour?

   It is not required that you know how to swim. You only need to know how
   to float. The in-water portion of the tour is very brief and shallow.
   In addition, you will be aided by your life jacket and wetsuit, which
   help you stay afloat.

   What is the temperature of the water?

   The water is cool, with a temperature of 22º C to 24º C, or 69º F to
   75º F. However, our visitors wear neoprene wetsuits and life vests to
   keep them comfortable and help mitigate the brisk water temperature.

   What does the tour consist of?

   This is a one-of-a-kind, guided cave tour that includes a combination
   of walking and swimming.

   What happens if I want to go on the tour, but I have a child that is
   younger than the age in which they’re allowed to participate? Do you
   have someone who can take care of children who are too young to take
   the tour?

   In these cases, please ask Río Secreto in advance if there is someone
   who can care for your children, specifying the date and time in which
   the babysitter will be needed, this service has an additional cost.

   Isn’t the cost of the tour a little high, considering the amount of
   time that you’re in the cave?

   For the cost of the tour, you are given exclusive access to a
   scientific wonder and lead by expert guides who happily share their
   knowledge of the area. You will use high-quality equipment and follow
   well-maintained paths to allow for optimum safety and enjoyment. Our
   technically advanced photography system will take photos of you as you
   make your way through this once-in-a-lifetime experience. Rest assured,
   the cost includes many things to make your tour memorable and the
   amount of time you spend in the cave will absolutely fulfill your
   expectations.

   Is the cost of transportation very high?

   $109 USD includes the Río Secreto tour and transportation from Riviera
   Maya, but you can also get there on your own by taking public
   transportation and paying the admission fee of $79 USD . See the
   instructions, How do I get to Río Secreto?
