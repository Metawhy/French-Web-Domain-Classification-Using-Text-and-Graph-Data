   This professional quality unbranded flash / HTML5 video shows you how
   to take advantage of the reusable block function inside WordPress’ post
   and page editor.

   You can use it, and our other white label videos, as your branded
   tutorials to users, clients or internal staff… and have them
   automatically updated with every version of WordPress.

   This ‘Reusable Blocks’ tutorial covers:
     * Creating a “Reusable” block from one block
     * Creating a “Reusable” block from multiple blocks
     * Inserting a “Reusable” block into a post or page
     * Editing a pre-saved “Reusable” block
     * Deleting “Reusable” blocks

   The “Reusable Blocks” feature inside WordPress’ post and page editor
   allows you to archive some of your favorite block configurations. This
   streamlines your workflow, and in turn…saves you lots of time!

   To create a reusable block, click the “More Options” (shows at 3 dots)
   button and select “Add to Reusable Blocks”.

   Similarly, You can also save a reusable block out of a collection of
   several blocks by highlighting the desired blocks, clicking the “More
   Options” button, and choosing “Add to Reusable Blocks”.

   To insert one of your pre-created blocks to a post or page, when adding
   a new block, scroll down to “Reusable”, click the dropdown arrow, and
   make your selection.

   If you’d like to make changes to one of your reusable creations, add it
   to a post or page and click “Edit”. Note: if you make edits this way,
   it’ll change the block everywhere else it is in use!

   To make quick or one-time adjustments, after adding the block, click
   the “More Options” button, and hit “Convert to Regular Block”.

   If you ever want to delete/edit any of your reusable blocks, go to the
   “Reusable” section and click “Manage All Reusable Blocks”.

   When that page loads, you can hover over any pre-made block and choose
   “Trash”.

   Being able to save your favorite configurations allows you to focus on
   what REALLY matters…content! Now go fill your life with lots and lots
   of blocks.

   Install and Configure WordPress Themes


   This ‘Installing Themes’ tutorial covers:
     * Finding the theme uploader
     * Theme searches
     * Multisite and single site navigation
     * Uploading a theme from your computer

   Your theme has a large impact on how people interact with your site and
   controls many of the visual elements. Choosing the right theme or
   switching themes can add great value to your site. By default the theme
   uploader is only available to administrators on a single site
   installation and a network administrator on a Multisite.

   To find the theme uploader, on a network hover over ‘My Sites’ in the
   Admin Bar and click ‘Network Admin’. Then go to ‘Themes’ and click ‘Add
   New’. If you are on a single site WordPress installation, hover over
   ‘Appearance’ in the dashboard and click ‘Themes’. From the themes
   screen click ‘Add New’. At the top of the ‘Add Themes’ screen you will
   find the ‘Upload Theme’ button.

   Click 'Add New' from the 'Themes' screen. Click 'Add New' from the
   'Themes' screen. Click ‘Add New’ from the ‘Themes’ screen.

   Click ‘Choose File’ to use the desktop browser to locate the zipped
   theme file you want to upload and click ‘Open’. When the theme you want
   to load is selected click ‘Install Now’. After the theme is finished
   unpacking the ‘Live Preview’ button will take you to the ‘Customizer’
   for a preview, customizations and activation–or click activate to make
   the new theme live on your site.

   The ‘Add Themes’ page also lets you search through and preview
   thousands of themes before installing them. The ‘Featured’ link
   highlights a few of the available themes. ‘Popular’ shows a list of the
   most downloaded themes and ‘Latest’ lets you see the most recently
   added themes. ‘Feature Filter’ lets you sort through themes based on
   color, layout, features and subject.  Hovering over a theme will reveal
   ‘Install’, ‘Preview’ and ‘Details’ options.

   Hover over a theme to reveal options. Hover over a theme to reveal
   options. Hover over a theme to reveal options.

   Introduce your users, clients or internal staff to uploading and
   discovering new themes and give them easy access to quickly and
   efficiently giving WordPress powered sites a makeover.
