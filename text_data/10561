1010music blackbox demos playlist

   I’ve created a playlist for my videos on the awesome blackbox
   sampler/sequencer from 1010music.

Game Boy lineout, a.k.a. Prosound mod

   I soldered a TRS 3.5mm audio jack to the direct line level stereo
   output of my Game Boy DMG. Wow does it sound richer and beefier
   (technical terms)! Still responds to the volume pot and I may have
   recorded this a bit hot.
   Audio recorded from Game Boy to Alesis mixer. I didn’t change the
   volume dial on the GB when I swapped the cable between outputs, so the
   volume difference is inherent between them.

   I followed this page for guidance:

Swiss Music Box Movement Restoration

   This music box movement comes from a family heirloom rocking rooster
   (like a rocking horse) that I believe my dad had when he was a kid in
   the late 1930s – early 1940s. The music box stopped working long ago.
   With the advice of my friend and automaton builder/clock repairman Dug
   North, I intend to restore it to it’s former glory.

   The music box mechanism itself was made by Thorens of Ste. Croix,
   Switzerland.

   So far, I’ve loosened up the parts with sewing machine oil and then
   some WD-40. I used a pick and a wooden pointed dowel to scrape out come
   green gunk — possibly corrosion and old lubricant? — and now things are
   moving a bit.

   Dug advised me to remove the comb before tackling the mainspring, in
   case the spring was wound and bound and could potentially unleash some
   fury on the drum causing damage to the comb.

   Sure enough, the mainspring is broken. Time to get a replacement.

   The Moog Drummer From Another Mother is a sweet drum synthesizer with
   8-step sequencer built in. It’s semi-modular and plays well with other
   modular gear. I like it!

Euroshield adds Arduino + Teensy to Eurorack Modular Synthesizer

   euroshield_IMG_1242.jpg
   I’ve been diving into the world of Eurorack format modular synthesizers
   for a little while now. A terrific, fun, and versatile addition to my
   rack has been the euroshield 1 by 1010music, a module that brings
   Arduino and Teensy to Eurorack.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDDoeX0KvO8?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   One of the things that attracted me to the Eurorack format is the
   terrific blend of analog and digital synthesis, control, and processing
   going on. As I put together my first small rack of equipment — a VCO
   (voltage controlled oscillator) for generating pitched audible-rate
   waveforms, VCA (voltage controlled amplifier), envelope generator,
   filter, and LFO (low frequency oscillator), I started to yearn for a
   way to inject other modulations, effects, and signal processing
   experimentally, without necessarily committing to the cost and size of
   more individual modules. The euroshield does just that.
   euroshield_IMG_1240
   I met Aaron Higgins at a modular event at Perfect Circuit Audio while
   he was in beta stages with the euroshield, and he kindly offered for me
   to test one out and give feedback. I added the euroshield to my rack,
   plugged in a Teensy 3.2, and installed the latest Teensyduino and
   excellent PJRC Teensy Audio Library, and the 1010music Euroshield
   example files.

   The euroshield and Teensy are powered by the 5V supply line inside the
   rack. The demo code let me fire up the four LEDs on the module, test
   the two trim pots and pushbutton to make sure everything was working.
   Then, its onto the good stuff — software defined module building! I
   created low pass filters, bit crushers, saw waves, LFO signals,
   arpeggios and note sequences, and more to interact over the signal
   inputs and outputs with the rest of my modules.
   euroshield_IMG_1243
   The euroshield (or a Teensy + Audio Shield) really shines when you
   start using the Audio System Design Tool for Teensy Audio
   Library https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/ which is a visual node-graph
   GUI for designing audio signal processing code. I had a lot of fun
   going through the tutorials from the Microcontroller Audio Workshop.
   101Music_Euroshield_03
   Then, I started cooking up my own bits of code to do things like
   generate semi-random sequences (turn the knobs to adjust the randomness
   and note ranges). I used the euroshield with a Teensy 3.6 as a class
   compliant USB MIDI host to send clock signals to an Arturia Beatstep,
   my modules, a Pocket Operator drum machine, and other MIDI devices.

   I also made a little reverb unit out of it. A friend of mine, Jim
   Bumgardner, is also using a euroshield in his rack, and wrote a very
   nice Turing Machine to generate random melodies that are pitch
   quantized.

   Before I got the euroshield I had been experimenting with using a
   Circuit Playground Express and a Metro M0 with my Eurorack, which also
   have lots of promise for interfacing with synthesizers, particularly
   using CircuitPython. My solutions for interfacing these currently
   involve a lot of alligator clip wires, so I’m very impressed at how
   nice and neat the euroshield is for tying together all of the wiring
   and circuits needed to have a microcontroller play nicely with -10V to
   +10V Eurorack control voltages.

   1010music euroshield.

Restoring an original Gameboy

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXx6VXSMEVs?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   I got this launch edition 1989 Nintendo Gameboy at a yard sale for $1
   and decided to restore it and clean it up. First, I needed to re-solder
   the battery connectors to the PCB so it would start up. Then, I cleaned
   out the cartridge slot so it would actually load games. The yellowing
   on the case was pretty gnarly, so I took it fully apart and used the
   hydrogen peroxide + UV light method to reverse the ageing. It worked
   great!

   The basic chemistry of it, as detailed in the retr0bright project page,
   is that there was bromine added to the ABS plastic to act as a fire
   retardant. Over time and exposure to UV light, the bromine finds its
   way to the surface, lending the yellow cast. Hydrogen Peroxide, and
   activator, and more UV light finish the job and allow the bromine to
   fly free, leaving the surface of the ABS entirely.

   Here you can see the front of the case after ageing for 29 years next
   to the back of the case after the hydrogen peroxide + sunlight for six
   hours treatment.

   IMG_1205


   You can search for the exact method and different recipes online, but
   you essentially need a high-ish concentration hydrogen peroxide — here
   I’ve got 20 volume which is 6% concentration — and an activator such as
   Oxy and something to thicken it. People call this Retr0brite. It turns
   out that salon-grade hair “bleach” has all of the necessary ingredients
   rolled into one bottle. IMG_1171

   Paint it on (after cleaning the case with water and rubbing alcohol and
   more water), seal it up in cling wrap, and put it in the sun for six
   hours. IMG_1173 IMG_1174 IMG_1175 IMG_1200 IMG_1202

   What a difference!

   IMG_1206

   Here, I’ve gotten the top half going. I didn’t leave it in the sun for
   as long and may give it another shot to further remove the yellowing.

                          Jeep Build – Wheel Spacers

   ‪I’m going to install wheel spacers on my Jeep today, all part of the
   bigger plan.

   These Spidertrax spacers will add 1.5” of backspace to my 17×7.5 wheels
   in order to accommodate 35”x12.5 tires.
