Testing Multimedia Laboratory

   We are different, we are better – Testing Multimedia Laboratory



   Think about how much audio visual, network and control equipment exists
   in a corporate building. Now imagine that the company that installs
   them has never tested them and uses your spaces as a testing workshop.
   This happens upwards of 90% of the AV integration companies in Mexico,
   and it quite common globally. The result of this leads to installations
   without adequate performance, delays in implementation times, equipment
   with technical faults on site that could have been prevented and poor
   control and automation configurations.

   To conquer this, Multimedia, our Mexican Global Presence Alliance team,
   have built a Testing Laboratory.

   For more than a decade, Multimedia has made an enormous effort so that
   all the equipment to be installed in a house, an office or an
   auditorium, are perfectly tested and configured. Multimedia does not
   experiment in the environments or spaces of their clients.

   Luis Galvan is the Multimedia Engineering Manager and is responsible
   for Multimedia integration projects to work well and the first time.
   “We have invested a lot in training and now we have the most complete
   testing laboratory in Mexico,” Luis says. “This is a space technically
   conceived to check beforehand that what we will install in the projects
   will be the right thing and that there will be no room for failures”.

   The Testing Multimedia Laboratory is located in Monterrey and was
   designed by the architecture firm LOL. It is a room with all the
   infrastructure to check wiring, wall keyboards, remote controls,
   connection boards, routers, access points, matrix switches, video
   routing, audio, lighting, automation and here are also checked video
   conferencing systems, microphones or 4K UHD video sources, to name a
   few technologies.

   Here, the racks to be installed in the client’s final spaces are
   pre-armed, in such a way that the necessary adjustments, configuration
   and semifinal start-up are made; once the equipment is moved to the
   final installations, it is enough to make connections to the house or
   office infrastructure and turn on all the equipment. Times are
   drastically reduced and quality of service is assured.

   All equipment lists are “loaded” into a tracking and check-in software,
   thus testing and verifying that each component works properly,
   including the control screens and iPads and the programming of each
   space.

   “Having the laboratory gives us a competitive advantage that our
   clients notice; while a team does all the wiring on site, another team
   is forming the equipment rack for each area that has to be moved to the
   client’s final place”, comments engineer Luis Galvan.

   In addition to improving execution times, this practice and workflow
   enhances the work of the operations personnel as it enriches the
   expertise of the installers and makes them more familiar with each and
   every one of the project teams.

   “The laboratory is already a mandatory process in our projects. This
   assures the quality of service and improves the experience of the
   clients. We want to establish long-term relationships with our
   customers and that they trust Multimedia as their sole provider of
   technological solutions,” concludes Luis Galvan.
