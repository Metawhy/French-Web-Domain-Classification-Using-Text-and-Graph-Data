Bordeaux’s five wine routes

Bordeaux, gateway to the vineyards

   Bordeaux has long had a reputation as a town that takes itself very
   seriously - too seriously perhaps - but no more. The history and
   culture are still here but UNESCO classified Bordeaux has shed her
   dowager frocks and the city of wine has become fun, lively and an award
   winning holiday destination. Welcome to Bordeaux, vintage 2016!

   The Bordelais love their wines, and it shows. It’s a city that lives
   and breathes wine - from the towering new temple to world wine - the
   Cité du Vin -  to tiny restaurants dedicated to matching food with the
   perfect claret - you’re never more than a step away from the urban wine
   trail.

Entre-deux-mers

   Entre Deux Mers takes its name from its location - the region in
   nestled between the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and lies to the
   south and east of Bordeaux. The region has a long wine producing
   history; the earliest vines were planted by the ancient Romans, 2000
   years ago. Wine produced by the Benedictine monks in the middle ages,
   initially for religious purposes, established Entre deux Mers
   reputation; pilgrims on the route to Santiago de Compostela resting at
   the Abbey would be offered the sweet white wines produced by the
   monks.  The remains of their 11c Abbey La Sauve Majeure have been
   declared a protected site by UNESCO.

Graves and Sauternes

   Larger than the Medoc but producing half the amount of wine, Graves
   forged a reputation for claret in England, with trade dating back to
   the marriage of Eleanor d’Aquitaine and the English king in the 12C.
   Wine production in the region, which stretches from the left bank of
   the Garonne to the forest of Les Landes, dates back to the 1st
   century.  The name comes from the region’s gravelly, pebbly soil which
   is perfect for grape growing.

   And then there’s neighbouring Sauternes.  In the 1855 classification of
   Bordeaux, the Medoc was the source of all but one red wine -  but
   Sauternes was the source of all the golden whites.  The most famous of
   them all, Yquem was singled out as a Premier Cru supérieur and the rest
   of the classified chateaux were divided into two categories.  The 3
   appellations are Graves, Pessac Léognan and Sauternes-Barsac.

Médoc

   The D2 which runs from Bordeaux up and along the length of the Médoc
   peninsula is the wine lovers equivalent of Route 66. Eight of the most
   famous Bordeaux appellations can be found in on the peninsular which is
   bordered by the Gironde estuary to the east and by the Atlantic ocean
   on the west side. Vast manmade forests protect the vines from the
   buffeting winds to the south.

Saint-Emilion-Pomerol-Fronsac

   St Emilion is renowned not only for its wines but for the town itself,
   dominating the Dordogne valley from its hilltop position. This vineyard
   make up the first vineyards in the world to be awarded the title of
   ‘Cultural Landscape’ by UNESCO on the World Heritage List in 1999 as a
   historical landscape that remains intact and continues as a working
   activity.

   Nearby Pomerol is much smaller but shares its Roman history with that
   of St Emilion with the tiny appellation of Lalande de Pomerol at its
   northern tip. A stone’s throw from Libourne, the principal town of the
   region, and the convergence of the rivers Dordogne and l’Isle, lies
   Fronsac with two main sectors: Fronsac and Canon Fronsac.
   Discover the route

Blaye and Bourg

   Bourg and Blaye are justifiably proud of their wines and their rich
   heritage. Blaye alone has 700 wine properties over 6000 acres which
   welcome visitors to try their wines and explore the region. The region
   also boasts the prehistoric caves, the Grotte de Pair-non-Pair at
   Prignac-et-Marcamps which are definitely worth a visit between
   tastings!

   Inspired by the Cité du Vin downriver in Bordeaux Bourg is in the midst
   of a wine tourism renaissance. The winegrowers in both regions have a
   reputation for being family friendly - most of the properties are
   family owned and the tours and tastings are run by the winemakers
   themselves. A wonderful region to explore and to learn about wine and
   how it is made.
