Bad photo

                      Oh no! I can't use that picture!

                        It is not really a good one!


   Bad-photo3


   Do you ever say that when looking at your pictures?


   Do you have pictures that you would so love to use but they are not
   good, have odd colors, are totally off center, or maybe you can only
   see Grandpa far in the distance?


There is hope.


   How would you use this off-centered photo?


   Bad-photo1


   Or what about this washed out image?


   Bad-photo2


   There ARE ways to use them. You can keep the feeling and enjoy the
   memories.


   You don't have to toss them away, especially if you don't have many
   others to choose from.


   Do you want to know how you can use similar "bad" photos in your
   scrapbook projects?

                              BAD-front-page-3D



    Click the red button below and I'll show you 8 different ways you can
                      still use those "missed" photos.
