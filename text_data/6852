   Why visit Chicago, USA

   The city of Chicago, known as the “Windy City”, sits on Lake Michigan
   in Illinois. It is one of the largest American cities, and is famous
   for its striking architecture and many top museums.

   A fun fact about Chicago is that the entertainer and entrepreneur Walt
   Disney was born there in 1901.

   Things to do in Chicago

   Visitors to Chicago should check out top sites such as Millennium Park;
   the Museum of Science and Industry (the largest science museum found in
   the Western Hemisphere); and the Art Institute of Chicago, which
   features numerous Impressionist works. Chicago is also the start of the
   famous ‘Route 66’, for those who are keen for a drive. Tourists are
   also likely to enjoy taking in the city views from the Skydeck Chicago
   at the top of Willis Tower. Other architecture of note includes the
   iconic John Hancock Center, and the neo-Gothic Tribune Tower.
