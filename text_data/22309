The Yoga Classroom

   The yoga classroom is a method for incorporating movement prior and
   during the lesson to allow the brain readiness to learn. I have found
   that my students are more articulate, attentive and focused after just
   3-5 minutes of linking breath with movement exercises. I use the
   classroom yoga border in my speech room and the students choose 3-5
   poses to do prior to sitting down for the lesson.
