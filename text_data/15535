Updated Privacy Policy

   December 4, 2017

   hollyannehogan

   As part of our commitment to privacy and transparency, we‚Äôre updating
   our Privacy Policy. We want to give you more information about how we
   collect and use personal information ‚Äî in a more organized and readable
   format.

   ‚ÄúYour privacy is critically important to us.‚Äù These are the first words
   of our Privacy Policy, and words we live by when designing and building
   our products.

   Here are some of the updates you‚Äôll see:
     * We split the Privacy Policy up into sections titled: Information We
       Collect, How We Use Information, Sharing Information, Choices, and
       Security. Our aim is to make the Policy easier to follow and
       understand. We really want you to read the whole thing!
     * We added specific information about how our Privacy Policy applies
       to Jetpack sites and the WordPress mobile app.
     * We included real-world, concrete examples to illustrate our
       policies and give you a clearer picture of how we collect and use
       personal information. For example, to explain our disclosures about
       access to mobile device data, we say: ‚Äú[i]f you give us permission
       to access the photographs on your mobile device‚Äôs camera roll, our
       Services may access the photos stored on your device when you
       upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.‚Äù
     * We provided more information, in the Choices section, about how you
       can limit and control the data that you provide to us when you use
       our services.

   New Privacy Policy Effective January 3, 2018

   Our new Privacy Policy will take effect on January 3, 2018. We‚Äôre
   releasing it now to give you time to take a look at it. If you continue
   to use our services on or after January 3, 2018, that will indicate
   your consent to the new Privacy Policy.

   ‚Ä¶.And Stay Tuned for What‚Äôs Next

   Our commitment to your privacy means more than just updating our
   Privacy Policy. We‚Äôre continually thinking about new ways to be more
   transparent about how we use data, and are building new tools and
   features to give you more control over the data you entrust to us.

   Some of these efforts are in anticipation of the General Data
   Protection Regulation (GDPR) ‚Äî a new EU privacy regulation that will
   affect Automattic and many of our customers. You can read more about
   our GDPR-readiness plans here.

   ***

   Although we updated a lot of the wording in our Privacy Policy, our
   core values remain unchanged: We strive to be fully transparent. We
   help protect our users from overreaching government demands for
   information. We keep the data we have a reason to keep. And we are
   thoughtful about how we collect, use, and share personal information.

       magnificent job with that. I like that you have updated, but I‚Äôve
       never had an issue. You guys are pretty good. You always answer all
       of my questions when I ask and provide as much information as you

       I really love and appreciate the simple, easy to understand wording
       ‚Äì usually reading policies for most products and services can be so
       headache inducing to those of us not in legal professions! Or, at
       least it is for me! üôÇ And I appreciate that you care about the
       privacy of your users and seem to collect (and store) the minimum
       amount of information necessary to run your services.
       Yay for transparency! More companies should take a leaf out of your
       book and write clear, easy to understand, transparent policies.
       Thank you for doing such an awesome job. üôÇ

       The biggest problem for the WP user is, do not allow comments made
       on pages, blogs, from other users to be fixed or reedited.
       I do not know what the justification is, but this is
       incomprehensible, and testify against the quality of service
       offered by WP.
       I hope this is reconsidered.

       ‚ù§ Good to hear! I am grateful for this, and very happy actually to
       have this opportunity to get this website for FREE. As soon as I
       can I will upgrade so that I may have my own .com :)) Meanwhile
       thank you, I've been longing to say this to you for some time but
       didn't know where I wrote an email but it came back ;-))) ‚ù§ Merry
       Christmas if we don't run into each other before! @goodflowsite we
       are in construction but feel free to take a look or follow if you
       want @goodflowdesign (instagram/fb etc)

       I really love and appreciate the simple, easy to understand wording
       ‚Äì usually reading policies for most products and services can be so
       headache inducing to those of us not in legal professions! Or, at
       least it is for me! üôÇ And I appreciate that you care about the
       privacy of your users and seem to collect (and store) the minimum
       amount of information necessary to run your services.
       Yay for transparency! More companies should take a leaf out of your
       book and write clear, easy to understand, transparent policies.
       Thank you for doing such an awesome job. üôÇ

       The biggest problem for the WP user is, do not allow comments made
       on pages, blogs, from other users to be fixed or reedited.
       I do not know what the justification is, but this is
       incomprehensible, and testify against the quality of service
       offered by WP.
       I hope this is reconsidered.
       Thank you!
