DEEP MAGIC on Kickstarter

Welcome to Midgard: The Season of War

   By Kobold Staff Sep 30, 2019 | Articles, Midgard | 0 comments
   The Seven Cities both revel in and depend on war. Customs and laws
   limit their wars’ gross destruction, provide a season for it, make it a
   source of status for their generals and nobles that glorifies their
   power and right to rule, and—not least of all—make war a source of
   valuable plunder and tribute from weaker states. Fighting a war
   correctly requires obeying its limits and forms. The practices and
   rituals governing war in the Septime lands...

Warlock’s Apprentice: Lost Combat Spells of the Red Wastes

   By Brian Suskind Sep 27, 2019 | Articles, Warlock's Apprentice | 0
   comments
   Two hundred years of war between the Mharoti Empire and Great Khandaria
   destroyed the fair country of Sindhu. Rivers of blood spilled from the
   clash of armies, titanic detonations of alchemical munitions, and
   arcane corruption from all manner of spells transformed this once
   fertile land into the Red Wastes. Yet among the hastily buried corpses,
   shattered skeletons of siege engines, and forgotten encampments, great
   plunder and lost arcana await...

   Tell us about a monster to win BOOKS! RPG monsters are the greatest
   thing ever! (Fight me!) For real, who doesn’t love monsters. They were
   literally the thing that drew me into RPGs, and there will never be

Beyond the Audience: Team Up

   By Celeste Conowitch Sep 23, 2019 | Articles, Beyond the Audience | 2
   comments
   Greetings, travelers! And welcome to Beyond the Audience where we
   provide tips and tricks for building an RPG show that is loved by both
   your players and the larger audience beyond your table. This time, I
   want to focus on a specific narrative strategy that does wonders for
   both players and viewers: incorporating teams into your storytelling.
   What exactly does that mean? Well let’s dive in! In the fantasy genre
   at large, there is a common trope...

Designing with Style: Heading to the Races

   By Hannah Rose Sep 20, 2019 | Articles, Designing with Style | 0
   comments
   In this installment, we’ll talk about headings (or headers, the terms
   are interchangeable), which are used to separate content into smaller
   pieces and indicate what information each of those pieces contain. The
   5th Edition style guide says, “We expect headings to be used logically
   and consistently throughout a manuscript.” From my perspective as an
   editor, this means a few different things. Use Headers Regularly. This
   one is pretty simple: if...

Appendix M: Advanced Reading in Midgard

   By Lou Anders Sep 18, 2019 | Articles, Midgard | 9 comments
   As every grognard knows, the original AD&D Dungeon Master’s Guide had a
   section at the end called “Appendix N: Inspirational and Educational
   Reading.” It was a list of the fantasy novels that inspired Gary Gygax
   to create the game. But it was also a “further reading” suggestion, the
   idea being to pay some love backward to the authors who carved out the
   fantasy genre while also serving up some sources of inspiration to
   beginning game masters...

Tome of Beasts: Drakon

   By Kobold Staff Sep 16, 2019 | Articles, Monsters | 0 comments
   These winged snakes are coastal beasts and sometimes confused with true
   dragons or wyverns. They are neither, but quite deadly in their own
   right. Searing Acid. Drakon fangs do not deliver venom; volatile acid
   constantly burbles up from a drakon’s stomach and enhances its attacks.
   A caustic drool clings to creatures they bite, and drakons can also
   belch clouds of searing vapor. Their lairs reek with acidic vapors and
   droplets of searing...

Warlock’s Apprentice: The Butcher’s Bill

   By Kelly Pawlik Sep 13, 2019 | Articles, Warlock's Apprentice | 0
   comments
   No matter how sophisticated the civilized races of Midgard become nor
   how peaceful the times seem, the threat of war is never far off. Just
   in recent history, the vampires of Morgau and Doresh annexed the former
   Electoral Kingdom of Krakova whose ruling family in exile now wages an
   internecine war against their conquerors. In the Seven Cities, where
   war is a way of life with a specific season for waging it, the Mharoti
   Empire ceased to be...

The Sorcery Stop: Lábak of Baba Yaga

   By GM Lent Sep 11, 2019 | Articles, The Sorcery Stop | 4 comments
   Baba Yaga is one of the great mysteries and a most fearsome wanderer.
   Though many know her name and many more recognize her legendary dancing
   hut, few can honestly claim to have met her, and fewer still enjoyed
   the experience. Almost none can claim kinship with the Grandmother, and
   no one known can claim her friendship or support. There are a few,
   however, that claim to use her power. Found mostly among expatriates
   from the Rothenian Plain, a...

   well-prepared players or to introduce monsters to a campaign. Alternate
   Traits and Actions The following changes allow GMs to alter a venom

Out of the Frying Pan: The Kronhorn’s Forgotten Friary

   By Robert Fairbanks Sep 4, 2019 | Articles, Out of the Frying Pan | 0
   comments
   Encounters have consequences. Every slain bandit has friends who will
   want revenge, and every devil banished back to the Eleven Hells reports
   its failure to its dark lord. What happens when the PCs’ daring deeds
   come back to bite them? The following encounter chains are more than
   just random conflicts. Each event flows organically into the next,
   sometimes without giving PCs the chance to catch their collective
   breath. Each link in the chain...

Welcome to Midgard: Dominion of the Wind Lords

   By Kobold Staff Sep 2, 2019 | Articles, Midgard | 0 comments
   To the west of the Crescent Desert lie the harsh and foreboding lands
   of the Dominion of the Wind Lords. Here, the great Stone Desert
   stretches to the sea in sun-baked plains of red and black rock. This is
   a bleakly beautiful landscape devoid of the crescent-shaped sand dunes
   found elsewhere in the Southlands. The seemingly barren Stone Desert
   hides bubbling springs, seasonal waterholes, and a scattering of
   precious oases. DOMINION OF THE WIND...

Warlock’s Apprentice: For Canton and Glory

   By Ben McFarland and Robert Fairbanks Aug 30, 2019 | Articles,
   Warlock's Apprentice | 0 comments
   The Ironcrags rise out of central Midgard, a stony sword thrust toward
   the heavens and the homeland of numerous dwarven clans that migrated
   from the Northlands. They found the mountains rich and verdant and
   established many scores of canton strongholds throughout the peaks and
   valleys. While dwarven culture became more urbane and political, the
   dwarves never lost their taste for combat and martial activities.
   Mercenary companies created by...
