Mission

   The France-Stanford Center for Interdisciplinary Studies aims to bridge
   the disciplines of the humanities, social sciences, sciences,
   engineering, business and law, addressing historical and contemporary
   issues of significance for France and the United States from a broad
   range of perspectives. Founded in partnership with the French Ministry
   of Foreign Affairs, the center provides research and event funding to
   Stanford faculty and students as well as counterparts in France.

   Funding opportunities for AY 2020-21 are now announced

   Electron Density Measurement of Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharges
   Using Photonic Crystals
   This project, which is a collaboration between groups at Stanford and
   at CNRS (France) investigates the use of one-dimensional plasma
   photonic crystals (which are periodic arrays of ionized gases that have
   a tunable refractive index in the microwave…
   The Quest for Earth's Primordial Geochemical Reservoirs
   The Earth was extensively molten in the first 100 million years after
   its formation. In that span of time, it acquired much of its
   present-day structure: the metallic core segregated and sank towards
   the center, while the mantle and crust separated…
   New Robotic Tools for Deep Sea Archaeology: Enabling Safe Remote
   Manipulation of Centuries Old Artifacts
   Deep-water wrecks are remarkably well preserved, protected from
   negative environmental factors (storms, strong currents, high
   temperatures), naval shipworm, rapid oxidation and, of course, all but
   the most determined of looters. Over the last couple…
   Interaction Networks and Spatial Complexity in Mosquito-borne Diseases
   The World Health Organization estimates that one of the main
   consequences of global warming will be an increased burden of
   mosquito-borne diseases. The spatial complexity of mosquito-borne
   diseases is currently thwarting control efforts. The…
   X-ray Imaging of Cultural Heritage - Bringing to Light Our History
   Over the past decade there has been a rapid growth in the use of X-ray
   imaging techniques to study cultural heritage and related fields
   including art, archaeology and paleontology. Yet with the field still
   in its infancy there is a lack of…
   Inertial Sensors Based Analysis of Gait on Children With Spastic
   Cerebral Palsy
   Analysis of walking abnormalities is an important clinical assessment
   used for treatment of gait disorders in children with cerebral palsy
   (CP). Camerabased motion capture, the current gold standard, enables
   practitioners to perform gait analyses…
   The Mouse Lemur as a New Model for Human Obesity
   Obesity is an escalating problem worldwide, often attributed to diet
   but with strong genetic contributions. Genetic studies have begun to
   identify obesity genes, but current model organisms for these studies
   are problematic. We are exploring mouse…
   Accelerating Antimatter in Plasmas - New Approaches to Overcome a
   Long-standing Challenge
   The discovery of the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle responsible for
   endowing all other particles with mass, is one of the major discoveries
   of the last decade. To unlock the mysteries of the subatomic world,
   physicists use the world’s most…
   Learning Sound and Meaning Jointly in Early Language Acquisition
   Language acquisition — the process by which children break into their
   native language — is both an exciting scientific frontier and a
   critical applied issue. During the course of acquisition, babies both
   have to learn the meanings of…
   The Role of Social Assistance Programs in the Socioeconomic
   Incorporation of Immigrants. A Comparative Study of Latino Immigrants
   in France, Spain and in the United States
   The project examines the role of social programs in the incorporation
   of Latin American immigrants in France and the United States. The
   project seeks to understand how immigrants interact with social
   assistance programs and how experiences with…
