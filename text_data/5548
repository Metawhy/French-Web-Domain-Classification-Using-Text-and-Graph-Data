   South Jakarta resident Putri Buddin, 23, has to let millions of rupiah
   in cash go after the bills she had stored inside a cabinet were damaged
   and eaten by termites.

   Putri shared a photo of the damaged cash on her Twitter account
   @putribuddim. As of Wednesday afternoon, the post garnered more than
   2,600 retweets and 2,700 likes.

     Niat hati biar ga boros, simpen uang di lemari, eh malah dimakan
     rayapüíî
     Sedi banget sumpaaaüò≠
     Kalo kaya uangnya rusak separah ini bisa dituker ke bank ga si guys?

     ‚Äî Putri Buddin (@putribuddin) August 17, 2019

   She said that she stored the money inside the cabinet last year for her
   grandmother, who has recently passed away.

   ‚ÄúSo I gave my grandmother about Rp 3 million in cash. She said that she
   did not want to use it, so I put it inside the cabinet. I told her if
   she needed money she could just take some from there,‚Äù Putri said on
   Tuesday, kompas.com reported.

   ‚ÄúBut instead of taking it, [grandmother] kept putting more money in
   until it reached about Rp 10 million. I did not know that and I forgot
   that I put the cash inside the cabinet,‚Äù she said.

   After her grandmother passed away, Putri checked the cash inside the
   cabinet and found two plastic bags.

   ‚ÄúThere were two bundles of bills; one bundle was inside a paper bag and
   the other was inside a plastic bag. I threw away the paper bag because
   it had become a termite nest,‚Äù Putri said.

   She counted the remaining bills inside the plastic bag and found she
   was able to identify about Rp 5.4 million of it.

   Putri visited Bank Indonesia and asked whether the damaged bills could
   be replaced with new ones. However, after an assessment, it turned out
   that not all the bills were eligible.

   ‚ÄúThe damaged bills must be at least 67 percent intact,‚Äù Putri said.

   Out of about Rp 5.4 million, only Rp 1.05 million worth of the bills
   were eligible to be replaced with new ones.

   Separately, Bank Indonesia spokesperson Onny Widjanarko said that
   damaged, wrinkled, defective, or withdrawn bills could no longer be
   used for transactions.

   ‚ÄúFor residents who have bills that can no longer be used, such as
   defective or damaged ones, they can replace those bills with new ones
   at the nearest Bank Indonesia branch,‚Äù Onny said. (ami)

   The Jakarta administration announced on Thursday the 2019 minimum wage,
   which has been set at Rp 3.94 million (US$260), as stated in
   Gubernatorial Regulation No. 114/2018.

   The figure is around 8 percent increase from the current minimum wage
   of Rp 3.6 million.

   The announcement took place simultaneously with other regions across
   the country, as suggested by Manpower Ministerial Regulation No. 7/201
   on the minimum wage.

   In a written statement published on the city‚Äôs official website, the
   Jakarta administration also cited its program to improve workers‚Äô
   welfare in the city through the Kartu Pekerja, or worker‚Äôs card.

   The program is aimed at helping low-income workers to cut their
   expenditure especially on transportation, household needs and
   education.

   In order to get the card, workers whose monthly income is equal to or
   10 percent higher than the minimum wage should submit an application to
   the city administration. The application should include copies of their
   ID card (KTP), family card (KK), tax number (NPWP), a salary slip and
   an official letter from their employer.

   ‚ÄúThe application can be submitted to the Manpower Agency or
   sub-agencies or through union representatives,‚Äù the statement read.

   Under the program, the card holder will be able to use Transjakarta
   buses for free. The card also provides subsidies for basic household
   needs in city-owned traditional markets and allowances for their
   children‚Äôs education.

   The education subsidy ranges from Rp 250,000 per month for an
   elementary school pupil to Rp 1.8 million per semester for older
   students. (vla)

       South Jakartan loses millions of rupiah in cash eaten by termites

   South Jakarta resident Putri Buddin, 23, has to let millions of rupiah
   in cash go after the bills she had stored inside a cabinet were damaged
   and eaten by termites.

   Putri shared a photo of the damaged cash on her Twitter account
   @putribuddim. As of Wednesday afternoon, the post garnered more than
   2,600 retweets and 2,700 likes.

   She said that she stored the money inside the cabinet last year for her
   grandmother, who has recently passed away.

   ‚ÄúSo I gave my grandmother about Rp 3 million in cash. She said that she
   did not want to use it, so I put it inside the cabinet. I told her if
   she needed money she could just take some from there,‚Äù Putri said on
   Tuesday, kompas.com reported.

   ‚ÄúBut instead of taking it, [grandmother] kept putting more money in
   until it reached about Rp 10 million. I did not know that and I forgot
   that I put the cash inside the cabinet,‚Äù she said.

   After her grandmother passed away, Putri checked the cash inside the
   cabinet and found two plastic bags.

   ‚ÄúThere were two bundles of bills; one bundle was inside a paper bag and
   the other was inside a plastic bag. I threw away the paper bag because
   it had become a termite nest,‚Äù Putri said.

   She counted the remaining bills inside the plastic bag and found she
   was able to identify about Rp 5.4 million of it.

   Putri visited Bank Indonesia and asked whether the damaged bills could
   be replaced with new ones. However, after an assessment, it turned out
   that not all the bills were eligible.

   ‚ÄúThe damaged bills must be at least 67 percent intact,‚Äù Putri said.

   Out of about Rp 5.4 million, only Rp 1.05 million worth of the bills
   were eligible to be replaced with new ones.

   Separately, Bank Indonesia spokesperson Onny Widjanarko said that
   damaged, wrinkled, defective, or withdrawn bills could no longer be
   used for transactions.

   ‚ÄúFor residents who have bills that can no longer be used, such as
   defective or damaged ones, they can replace those bills with new ones
   at the nearest Bank Indonesia branch,‚Äù Onny said. (ami)

   The Jakarta administration announced on Thursday the 2019 minimum wage,
   which has been set at Rp 3.94 million (US$260), as stated in
   Gubernatorial Regulation No. 114/2018.

   The figure is around 8 percent increase from the current minimum wage
   of Rp 3.6 million.

   The announcement took place simultaneously with other regions across
   the country, as suggested by Manpower Ministerial Regulation No. 7/201
   on the minimum wage.

   In a written statement published on the city‚Äôs official website, the
   Jakarta administration also cited its program to improve workers‚Äô
   welfare in the city through the Kartu Pekerja, or worker‚Äôs card.

   The program is aimed at helping low-income workers to cut their
   expenditure especially on transportation, household needs and
   education.

   In order to get the card, workers whose monthly income is equal to or
   10 percent higher than the minimum wage should submit an application to
   the city administration. The application should include copies of their
   ID card (KTP), family card (KK), tax number (NPWP), a salary slip and
   an official letter from their employer.

   ‚ÄúThe application can be submitted to the Manpower Agency or
   sub-agencies or through union representatives,‚Äù the statement read.

   Under the program, the card holder will be able to use Transjakarta
   buses for free. The card also provides subsidies for basic household
   needs in city-owned traditional markets and allowances for their
   children‚Äôs education.

   The education subsidy ranges from Rp 250,000 per month for an
   elementary school pupil to Rp 1.8 million per semester for older
   students. (vla)

   South Jakarta resident Putri Buddin, 23, has to let millions of rupiah
   in cash go after the bills she had stored inside a cabinet were damaged
   and eaten by termites.

   Putri shared a photo of the damaged cash on her Twitter account
   @putribuddim. As of Wednesday afternoon, the post garnered more than
   2,600 retweets and 2,700 likes.

   She said that she stored the money inside the cabinet last year for her
   grandmother, who has recently passed away.

   ‚ÄúSo I gave my grandmother about Rp 3 million in cash. She said that she
   did not want to use it, so I put it inside the cabinet. I told her if
   she needed money she could just take some from there,‚Äù Putri said on
   Tuesday, kompas.com reported.

   ‚ÄúBut instead of taking it, [grandmother] kept putting more money in
   until it reached about Rp 10 million. I did not know that and I forgot
   that I put the cash inside the cabinet,‚Äù she said.

   After her grandmother passed away, Putri checked the cash inside the
   cabinet and found two plastic bags.

   ‚ÄúThere were two bundles of bills; one bundle was inside a paper bag and
   the other was inside a plastic bag. I threw away the paper bag because
   it had become a termite nest,‚Äù Putri said.

   She counted the remaining bills inside the plastic bag and found she
   was able to identify about Rp 5.4 million of it.

   Putri visited Bank Indonesia and asked whether the damaged bills could
   be replaced with new ones. However, after an assessment, it turned out
   that not all the bills were eligible.

   ‚ÄúThe damaged bills must be at least 67 percent intact,‚Äù Putri said.

   Out of about Rp 5.4 million, only Rp 1.05 million worth of the bills
   were eligible to be replaced with new ones.

   Separately, Bank Indonesia spokesperson Onny Widjanarko said that
   damaged, wrinkled, defective, or withdrawn bills could no longer be
   used for transactions.

   ‚ÄúFor residents who have bills that can no longer be used, such as
   defective or damaged ones, they can replace those bills with new ones
   at the nearest Bank Indonesia branch,‚Äù Onny said. (ami)

   The Jakarta administration announced on Thursday the 2019 minimum wage,
   which has been set at Rp 3.94 million (US$260), as stated in
   Gubernatorial Regulation No. 114/2018.

   The figure is around 8 percent increase from the current minimum wage
   of Rp 3.6 million.

   The announcement took place simultaneously with other regions across
   the country, as suggested by Manpower Ministerial Regulation No. 7/201
   on the minimum wage.

   In a written statement published on the city‚Äôs official website, the
   Jakarta administration also cited its program to improve workers‚Äô
   welfare in the city through the Kartu Pekerja, or worker‚Äôs card.

   The program is aimed at helping low-income workers to cut their
   expenditure especially on transportation, household needs and
   education.

   In order to get the card, workers whose monthly income is equal to or
   10 percent higher than the minimum wage should submit an application to
   the city administration. The application should include copies of their
   ID card (KTP), family card (KK), tax number (NPWP), a salary slip and
   an official letter from their employer.

   ‚ÄúThe application can be submitted to the Manpower Agency or
   sub-agencies or through union representatives,‚Äù the statement read.

   Under the program, the card holder will be able to use Transjakarta
   buses for free. The card also provides subsidies for basic household
   needs in city-owned traditional markets and allowances for their
   children‚Äôs education.

   The education subsidy ranges from Rp 250,000 per month for an
   elementary school pupil to Rp 1.8 million per semester for older
   students. (vla)
