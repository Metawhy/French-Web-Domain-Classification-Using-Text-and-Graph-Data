   Welcome to Well Family, Well’s new home for news about parenting, child
   health and relationships plus advice from our experts to help every
   family live well.

   Recently, university researchers asked children and parents to describe
   the rules they thought families should follow related to technology.

   In most cases, parents and children agreed — don’t text and drive;
   don’t be online when someone wants to talk to you. But there was one
   surprising rule that the children wanted that their parents mentioned
   far less often: Don’t post anything about me on social media without
   asking me.

   As in, no pictures of them asleep in the back of the car. No posts
   about their frustration with their homework. That victory picture after
   the soccer game? Maybe. The frustrated rant about the fight you just
   had over laundry? No way.

   The answers revealed “a really interesting disconnect,” said Alexis
   Hiniker, a graduate student in human-centered design and engineering at
   the University of Washington who led the research. She, along with
   researchers at the University of Michigan, studied 249 parent-child
   pairs distributed across 40 states and found that while children ages
   10 to 17 “were really concerned” about the ways parents shared their
   children’s lives online, their parents were far less worried. About
   three times more children than parents thought there should be rules
   about what parents shared on social media.

   Sites like Facebook and Instagram are now baked into the world of
   today’s families. Many, if not most, new parents post images of their
   newborn online within an hour of birth, and some parents create social
   media accounts for the children themselves — often to share photos and
   news with family, although occasionally in the pursuit of “Instafame”
   for their fashionably clad, beautifully photographed sons and
   daughters.

   With the first babies of Facebook (which started in 2004) not yet in
   their teens and the stylish kids of Instagram (which started in 2010)
   barely in elementary school, families are just beginning to explore the
   question of how children feel about the digital record of their
   earliest years. But as this study, although small, suggests, it’s
   increasingly clear that our children will grow into teenagers and
   adults who want to control their digital identities.

   “As these children come of age, they’re going to be seeing the digital
   footprint left in their childhood’s wake,” said Stacey Steinberg, a
   legal skills professor and associate director of the Center on Children
   and Families at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. “While
   most of them will be fine, some might take issue with it.”

   Some children and teenagers question both past and present sharing. “I
   really don’t like it when my parents post pictures of me on their
   social media accounts, especially after finding out that some of my
   friends follow them,” said Maisy Hoffman, 14, an eighth grader who
   lives in Manhattan. “I worry more about my dad. He doesn’t always ask
   if he can post things, so I immediately turn away and ask if he’s going
   to post it. Or I’ll find out later because my friend saw something of
   me on his Instagram and I’ll have to ask him to take it down.”

   Other parents can also present a problem for the child who prefers to
   control how she appears online. Wendy Bradford, a mother of three
   elementary-school aged children in Manhattan, said that when parent
   chaperones took pictures during a third-grade field trip to the zoo,
   her daughter “hid when she saw the phones because she didn’t want the
   pictures to be posted on Facebook with her in them.”

   Isabella Aijo, 15, a high school sophomore in Natick, Mass., said, “I
   definitely know people who have parents who post things they wish
   weren’t out there. There was a girl in my eighth grade class whose mom
   opened a YouTube account for her in the fourth grade to show off her
   singing,” she wrote to me in an email. “Finally, on one of the last
   months of middle school, a peer played the song in class and almost the
   entire class laughed hysterically over it.”

   Those early posts from parents linger, not just online, but in our
   children’s memories — and the topics may be things we don’t see as
   potentially embarrassing. The son of a friend (who asked that I not use
   her name) still brings up things she wrote about his picky eating when
   he was younger — years ago, she says.

   But that kind of sharing — about food issues, potty training and
   tantrums — is exactly the kind of sharing that can be valuable.
   “Children benefit from the community created when parents have the
   ability to share their stories,” said Ms. Steinberg. Those posts about
   picky eating might have helped my friend find solutions, or a fresh
   wellspring of patience for a behavior her child would eventually
   outgrow.

   When parents share those early frustrations, they don’t see themselves
   as exposing something personal about their children’s lives, but about
   their own. As a society, says Ms. Steinberg, “we’re going to have to
   find ways to balance a parent’s right to share their story and a
   parent’s right to control the upbringing of their child with a child’s
   right to privacy.

   “Parents often intrude on a child’s digital identity, not because they
   are malicious, but because they haven’t considered the potential reach
   and the longevity of the digital information that they’re sharing,”
   said Ms. Steinberg.

   In general, said Sarita Schoenebeck, an assistant professor at the
   University of Michigan School of Information, who co-authored the
   research, both children and parents considered positive images, events
   and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. Parents can
   consider, too, the searchability and reach of the format (although
   those are always evolving). A frustrated tweet about a child who won’t
   eat her cereal because it’s not in a red bowl is a lot less likely to
   resurface than a YouTube video of the resulting tantrum. Looking for
   advice or sympathy about a behavioral problem? Skip both the image, and
   your child’s name, in a post to limit later searches.

   At our house, I sometimes see the hesitation in my oldest son, who is
   14, when I bring out the camera at a goofy moment, but we have a whole
   house rule: no sharing images of anyone else without their consent,
   ever. That trust means I get my candid shots, and he keeps his digital
   identity, whatever he eventually wants it to be, intact.

Q

Should 20-somethings and older folks be getting boosters for childhood
immunizations that may have lost potency? Which ones?

   Reader Question • 519 votes

A

   By your early 20s, there’s a good chance you are due for some boosters,
   said Dr. Wanda Filer, president of the American Academy of Family
   Physicians. You may also “need to play catch-up” if you’ve missed any
   vaccines or failed to complete a series, she said.

   Everyone needs a tetanus and diphtheria booster every 10 years; the
   shots are often combined. So if you were 12 the last time you had a
   tetanus shot, you’re due for one at 22.

   Adults ages 19 to 64 should also get a pertussis, or whooping cough,
   booster. Pregnant women should be vaccinated against pertussis toward
   the end of each pregnancy in order to protect their newborns from this
   disease, which can be devastating for a baby.

   If you are not pregnant but may become pregnant, it’s a good idea to
   plan ahead and be tested for immunity to two other childhood diseases:
   rubella and chickenpox. If you do not have evidence of immunity -- and
   are not pregnant -- you should be vaccinated.

   If you were not vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, or HPV,
   or did not complete the recommended series of three doses, women can
   complete the series through age 26, and men through age 21, with more
   leeway for men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune
   systems, who who may be vaccinated through age 26. The HPV series
   protects against viruses that cause cervical cancer, head and neck
   cancers and anal cancer.

   Beyond childhood immunizations, flu shots are recommended every year
   “for just about everybody,” Dr. Filer said. The shingles vaccine is
   also recommended for older adults.

   You may also want to check whether you’ve been vaccinated against
   meningitis, said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult
   immunizations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s a
   good idea to obtain a record of your vaccinations, she said, and to
   encourage your physician to input your record into a state vaccine
   registry.

   The above recommendations are for the general population. Additional
   vaccines may be advised for anyone with a chronic health condition such
   as a compromised immune system, asthma or diabetes; those who work in
   the health care field; men who have sex with men; people who travel to
   certain parts of the world; and adults 60 or older. Talk with your
   doctor.

   You can find out if you’re due for shots by taking the C.D.C.’s online
   vaccination quiz, Dr. Bridges suggested. “Vaccine recommendations are
   confusing."

   Strategically skipping bread, pasta and other carbohydrates at dinner
   might improve subsequent athletic performance, provided those low-carb
   meals are combined with the right types of workouts, according to a new
   sports nutrition study. Its findings undercut some entrenched ideas
   about how athletes should eat in preparation for spring marathons and
   other endurance races.

   As those of us who are athletes or spend time around them know, diets
   are a topic of consuming interest for the group, since an athlete’s
   diet affects how well he or she can train, recover, progress, chisel a
   physique and compete.

   But the ideal sports diet remains elusive. Many dietitians and coaches
   advocate for heaps of carbohydrates at the training table.
   Carbohydrates, which break down during digestion into sugar, are the
   body’s first choice as fuel during exercise. But the body’s reservoir
   of stored carbohydrates is small, and even if athletes supplement their
   supply during exercise with sugary drinks or food, prolonged or intense
   exertion generally incinerates much of the body’s available
   carbohydrates.

   Consequently, some experts suggest that athletic success may depend in
   part on making the body better able to use fat as a fuel. Even the
   leanest athlete’s body is girded with the stuff, theoretically
   providing enough energy for even the longest, hardest workouts.
   Low-carbohydrate diets will force the body to turn to fat. But working
   muscles must become used to burning fat, a process that can make
   exercising on a low-carb diet difficult in the short term. Indeed,
   athletes on extremely low-carbohydrate diets tend to struggle to finish
   hard workouts.

   So researchers at the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise and
   Performance in Paris and other institutions began to wonder about the
   possibilities of modified forms of low-carb diets, and specifically
   about what they and other scientists call “sleeping low.”

   With a “sleep-low” sports diet, an athlete skips carbohydrates at
   dinner. In the morning, his or her body should have low reserves of the
   macronutrient, and any ensuing workouts would force the body to turn to
   fat, its most abundant fuel. In past studies of the technique, however,
   it has produced mixed results in terms of whether it improves
   competitive performance.

   The authors of the new study, which was published in January in
   Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, suspected that the sleep-low
   diet needed to be integrated into a broader training plan in order to
   show desirable results.

   To test that possibility, they recruited 21 experienced, competitive
   triathletes who bravely agreed to have their diets manipulated. The
   scientists ran their volunteers through a simulated triathlon and other
   tests of their current fitness and pace.

   Half of the athletes were then randomly assigned to eat a standard
   sports diet, with large helpings of carbohydrates at every meal and
   after workouts.

   The others were put on a sleep-low regimen. With this program, the
   athletes consumed the same amount of carbohydrates over the course of
   the day as the other group, but in a different sequence. Virtually all
   of their carbohydrates were consumed at breakfast and lunch, with none
   at dinner.

   At the same time, all of the athletes also began a new training
   program. In the afternoon, both groups completed a draining, intense
   interval-training session, designed to increase fitness and deplete the
   body’s carbohydrate stores. The members of the control group then
   replenished their carbohydrates at dinner; the sleep-low group did not.

   Next morning, before breakfast, the volunteers pedaled for an hour at a
   moderate pace on stationary bicycles. By this time, the sleep-low group
   was running on carbohydrate fumes and body fat.

   Afterward, all of the athletes sat down to large, carb-rich breakfasts
   and lunches, meaning that both groups were flush with carbohydrates for
   the afternoon interval training.

   This program continued for four days per week for three weeks. (On the
   remaining days, the athletes ran, cycled or swam at an easy pace and
   ate as they chose.)

   After three weeks, the athletes in the sleep-low group were grumbling
   about evening hunger.

   But when the researchers now repeated the simulated triathlon, those
   athletes in the sleep-low group showed notable improvement. Their times
   on the 10-kilometer running leg at the end of the race were faster by
   about 75 seconds, or 3 percent, than at the start of the study. The
   control group had not improved.

   The sleep-low volunteers also had lost body fat, while the other
   athletes had not.

   These findings suggest, said Laurie-Anne Marquet, a graduate student at
   the French National Institute of Sport who led the study, that
   exercising strenuously in the afternoon, depriving yourself of
   carbohydrates afterward, training gently the next morning and then
   swallowing a mound of pancakes might be a useful way to improve
   endurance and performance. The regimen seemed to have increased the
   athletes’ ability to access fat as muscle fuel, she said, allowing them
   to exercise harder during the workouts than the control group and gain
   additional fitness and speed.

   Such a rigorous routine is not for everyone, of course. Those of us not
   training for a marathon, triathlon or similar event probably would not
   enjoy or benefit from sleeping low. Even serious athletes should thread
   the approach into their training cautiously, Ms. Marquet said,
   beginning a few weeks before a race and easing off in the days just
   before the event, when they should down carbohydrates at will.

   Encouragingly for those tempted by the diet, though, “most of the
   athletes” in the study, Ms. Marquet said, “have now integrated this
   strategy into their training.”
