How to Start a Blog From Scratch – A Comprehensive Guide

   Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past decade or so,
   you’ve probably noticed the sudden increase in blogging websites.

   Regardless of the nature of your business, setting up a web presence is
   more important than ever before. And once you’ve got your website in
   place, you’ll need a blog to go with it – after all, blogging is
   perhaps one of the most powerful tools you can leverage to boost sales,
   attract new customers and build brand credibility with existing
   clients.

   With all of this in mind, we’ve decided to put together a comprehensive
   yet simple-to-follow step by step guide to help you create your very
   own blog from scratch. In this article, you’ll find everything you need
   from purchasing a domain name to selecting a hosting provider and
   installing software to publishing your first blog post.

   Let’s get started building your first blog!

5 Steps to Start a Blog

   Let me start off by saying that you don’t need to be programming
   literate to follow this practical guide – in fact, you won’t have to
   write a single line of code. To those of you who shy away from the mere
   thought of coding (don’t worry; I’m no stranger in that community!) I
   say “Fear not, for this guide is with you.”

   I’ll walk you through five simple steps to help you launch your blog:
    1. Choose a Blogging Platform
    2. Choose Suitable Hosting
    3. Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting
    4. Customize Your Blog
    5. Add Useful Plugins

   Now that we’ve gotten all of the preliminary details out of the ways,
   let’s jump right into the tutorial. You’ll have it up and running in
   the next 15 minutes – I kid you not!
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 1

Choose a Blogging Platform

   The first thing you’ll have to do is select a content management system
   (CMS) that will serve as the underlying platform for your blog. Now
   you’ve probably heard of a few of the major blogging platforms out
   there – WordPress, Blogger, Joomla, Drupal, etc.

WordPress All The Way

   I’m a huge advocate of WordPress and I wholeheartedly recommend it to
   anyone who wants to start their own blog. Here are a few simple reasons
   why:
     * It’s massive. As of the writing of this article, WordPress powers
       nearly 74.6 million websites.
     * It’s absolutely free. WordPress was essentially designed to be an
       open source project.

     * It’s secure and reliable. The dedicated team of developers behind
       WordPress, Automattic, is always updating the CMS to ensure maximum
       safety. If it’s safe enough for NASA, chances are it’s safe enough
       for you.
     * It’s scalable. Whether you want to launch a personal blog or are in
       hopes of a much bigger, CNN-sized site (yes, CNN runs on WordPress,
       too!), you can rest assured that it’ll operate without any
       glitches.

   Those of you who are launching their first blog and probably don’t have
   a ton of potential traffic lined up are far better off opting for
   WordPress. Aside from the platform-specific benefits the CMS offers,
   it’ll save you a ton of time, effort, and money.

   Hosting with WordPress is low-cost and installation takes 5 minutes.
   The best part, however, is and will always be that you don’t need to be
   exceptionally skilled in a web programming language (or even know the
   ABC’s of it) to launch and operate a successful WordPress-based blog.

   If you’re convinced that WordPress really is the best CMS out there,
   let’s move on to the next section.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 2

Choose Suitable Hosting

   Now that you’ve made the right decision in choosing WordPress as your
   CMS, there’s just one more choice to make – choosing a type of hosting
   provider.

   The decision you make at this stage will have a colossal effect on the
   outcome of your blog. You can choose to fork out a couple of dollars
   every month for self-hosting or go for a free alternative instead. And
   although the latter sounds absolutely incredible, that’s not the
   direction you’ll want to head in.

Why You Should Avoid Free Blog Sites

   With free blogging platforms (non-hosted platforms) the disadvantages
   always outnumber the advantages. Always. For starters, you get a
   terrible domain name – something like
   ‘myblog.freebloggingplatform.com’. Your blog’s domain name has a
   significant impact on SEO and social media marketing so if you want
   your blog to really take off and be discoverable then you’ll want to go
   with a self-hosting.

   A .com extension is the standard norm and nearly 75% of all websites
   have it. I’m not saying it’s impossible to attract millions of unique
   monthly page views with a .freebloggingplatform.com extension but how
   many successful bloggers (or any successful site for that matter) do
   you know by that domain name extension?

     “Brand is the sum total of how someone perceives a particular
     organization.”

   You want a web address that rolls off the tongue easily. One that
   people will remember. One that tactfully illustrates your brand and
   communicates what your blog is all about in a concise yet relevant set
   of characters.

Disadvantages of Non-Hosted Blogging Platforms

     * URL Problem. Your blog’s URL will be long, unappealing, and
       unprofessional.
     * No Real Ownership. Since you’re not paying for hosting, your blog
       won’t actually be your blog – it’s hosted on someone else’s web
       property. This means that they can delete it whenever they want.
     * Other Restrictions. Free blogging platforms don’t let you do all
       the cool stuff like monetize your blog, use themes, or install
       plugins. Worst of all, your site’s space on the server is limited
       which means you can’t even upload all of the images and videos you
       were hoping would attract traffic.

   These are factors that most of us simply can’t afford to compromise on.
   They are essential to the timely success of our blog and we’re willing
   to spend a few bucks for it.

   Luckily enough for you, I’ve worked out the most optimal and
   cost-efficient solution after carefully analyzing the hosting industry.
   (It’s a difficult and confusing world to navigate through.) Long story
   short: Bluehost is the winner.

Why Bluehost Is Best

   Bluehost offers everything from shared hosting to optimized hosting for
   WordPress at a reasonable price. Being a first-time webmaster, it’s
   best to go for shared hosting. The rest of them are advanced hosting
   services and more suitable for bigger blogs. You won’t need the kind of
   functionality they offer right away and when you feel like you do, you
   can always upgrade to another hosting plan.

   Bluehost’s Shared Hosting plan is an ideal candidate for several
   reasons:
    1. WordPress users get a special discount price at $3.49/month.
    2. You’ll get a free domain name.
    3. 1-click WordPress install.
    4. 24/7 support.
    5. 30-day money back guarantee.

   It stands to reason that WordPress and Bluehost go hand in hand — the
   best CMS paired with an affordable and reliable hosting provider. In
   the next section, we’ll walk you through a simple procedure to set up
   your domain name and hosting service with Bluehost.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 3

Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting

   Click here to visit the Bluehost homepage to begin setting up your
   first blog. We'll receive a commission if you decided to purchase
   through these links.

   1. On the Bluehost homepage, you’ll find products in the menu bar.
   Hover over it and click on shared hosting.
   Bluehost's products menu.

   Select shared hosting from the products menu.

   2. You will be redirected to a page that gives you a brief overview of
   Bluehost’s shared hosting plan. Click on the green get started now
   button to proceed with the setup.
   Get started now button.

   Get started with shared hosting.

   3. Select your preferred shared hosting plan. We recommend you go with
   the basic plan for now.
   Bluehost's pricing table.

   Select the basic shared hosting plan.

   4. The next page prompts you to select a domain name and domain name
   extension for your blog — the fun (sometimes frustrating) part of the
   whole experience. Click next once you’re done.
   Domain name.

   Enter a domain name.

   5. Once you select a domain name that you like and is available, you’ll
   see a verification message on the next page notifying you that the
   domain is available and you can advance to the next step.

   6. On the same page, you’ll see an account information form that
   requires you to fill out your personal details.
   Bluehost form.

   Fill in your account information.

   7. Once you’ve filled out your account information details, you’ll be
   prompted to select/deselect options for your package in the package
   information form.
   Package information form.

   Tick all the features you’d like to opt for.

   Let’s quickly review the options you can select to enhance the
   functionality and security of your brand new blogging site:
     * Constant Contact. Constant Contact is one of the best tools to
       connect with your audience without hassle. It allows you to create,
       send, and track emails and newsletters to your readership. This
       isn’t mandatory, but if you think that you’ll be sending emails to
       your subscribers regularly then go for it!
     * Domain Privacy Protection. A domain name’s whois information is
       available for anyone to acquire on the Internet. Most of the time,
       marketing companies leverage this information and send a ton of
       unwanted solicitations your way. By selecting this option, the only
       visible information will be Bluehost thus preventing your whois
       information from being publicly available.
     * Site Backup Pro. This feature takes automatic backups of your blog
       regularly. I would strongly recommend that you leave this box
       ticked. Choosing to opt out would mean that you’d have to take
       manual backups using a plugin.
     * Search Engine Jumpstart. Since you’re just starting out with your
       blog, you can leave this box un-ticked. There’s no reason to start
       worrying about search engines just yet.
     * SiteLock Security — Find. This feature isn’t compulsory but it adds
       an additional layer of security to your blogging site. Check out
       the features it offers to determine if it’s right for you.

   Leaving the default options as they are is perfectly fine, too.

   8. The billing information form requires you to fill in your credit
   card number to complete the transaction.
    1. Bluehost accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.
    2. Clicking on the More payment options link enables you to pay
       through your PayPal account.

   Billing information form.

   Enter your credit card information to complete the transaction.
    1. Once you’ve filled in your billing information, tick I confirm I
       have read and agree to the Terms of Service… box and click the
       submit button.

   Submit button to complete transaction.

   Click the submit button once you’ve filled out the forms.

   By now your hosting service and domain name are paid for. In the
   following steps, we’ll login to the Bluehost cPanel and use its 1-click
   WordPress install feature to install the CMS to our blog site.

   9. Using the login details emailed to you by Bluehost, sign in to the
   Bluehost cPanel.

   10. Under the website section on the homepage, click the Install
   WordPress button.
   Bluehost's cPanel.

   1-click WordPress install in Bluehost’s cPanel.

   11. You will be redirected to a new page with information about
   WordPress. Click the green Install button to continue with the
   installation.
   Green install button to complete WordPress installation.

   Click Install to proceed.

   12. On the next screen, select your newly registered domain name (it
   should be selected by default) to let the system know which directory
   you’d like to install WordPress to. Click Check Domain once you’re
   done.
   Selecting installation folder.

   Select your blog’s domain name from the drop-down menu.

   13. All that’s left is to enter your site’s name, your admin username,
   and a password in the next screen and you’re good to go! Click Install
   Now after filling out the form.
   Install button to initiate WordPress installation.

   Click Install!

   Note: Be sure to save your admin username and password in a text file.
   You’ll login to your blog using these credentials.

   Congratulations! By now you’ve successfully:
     * Registered a domain name.
     * Purchased web hosting for your blog.
     * Installed WordPress to your blog.

   14. Login to your blog site by clicking on the Admin URL that looks
   something like http://myblogname.com/wp-admin.
   WordPress Dashboard.

   Your WordPress Dashboard should look something like this.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 4

Customize Your Blog

   In this section, I’ll introduce you to the WordPress Dashboard and help
   you install a theme to increase your blog’s visual appeal.

An Introduction to the WordPress Dashboard

   The WordPress Dashboard can be quite overwhelming for first-time users
   but I promise you’ll get used to it sooner than you think. For the
   purpose of this post, I’ll cover the following items:
     * Activating a Theme
     * Writing Your First Post
     * Exploring the Media Library
     * Adding a User

   Sounds good? Let’s get started.

Activating a Theme

   We’ll start out by installing and activating a WordPress theme to our
   blog. By default, WordPress has its default theme activated (Twenty
   Sixteen as of this writing). We’re going to change the default theme to
   a more sophisticated and contemporary theme designed specifically for
   blogging sites. Enter Activello.

   Activello is a simple, multipurpose blog theme for WordPress designed
   by our exceptionally talented team. It’s got all the right features to
   get you started with a professional and modern-looking blog. Best of
   all it’s free! You can download it from here.
   Install Activello theme

   Upload the theme’s .zip file and click Install Now.
    1. From your WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Appearance menu item
       and click on Themes in the sub-menu. (Appearance > Themes)
    2. Once you’re at the Themes window, click the Add New button at the
       top
    3. Click the Upload Theme button and upload the theme’s .zip file.
    4. Once it’s uploaded, click Install Now.
    5. You will be redirected to a screen that notifies you of the status
       of the installation. Click the Activate link once the theme is
       successfully installed.

   You can leave it be or tweak it if you’d like to change a design aspect
   by navigating to Appearance > Customize. If you’re thinking of setting
   up a niche-specific blog then be sure to check out our complete
   collection of WordPress themes.

Writing Your First Post

   As a blogger, you’ll be writing a ton of posts so it’s important that
   you pay attention to this section to get the basics down.
   Adding a post.

   Post-ception!
    1. Hover over the Posts menu item and click Add New. (Posts > Add New)
    2. You’ll be redirected to the Add New Post screen which looks
       something like this:
    3. Add a suitable title in the text box that says Enter title here.
    4. In the big text editor below, add your post’s content. You’ll find
       that there’s a handy dandy toolbar embedded inside to help you
       format your post.
    5. Click the Publish button once you’re done.

   Voila! The post is published to your blog and everyone can see it now.
   How easy was that?

Exploring the Media Library

   The WordPress Media Library is a powerful tool that you can leverage to
   handle practically all of your media management. It stores all media
   files (images, videos, audio, and documents) that you upload to your
   WordPress blog regardless of whether it’s published or not.
   WordPress Media Library.

   The powerful Media Library.
    1. Click the Media menu item from the WordPress Dashboard.
    2. You will be redirected to the Media Library screen from where you
       can manage all of your media files.
    3. Click the Add New button at the top of the screen.
    4. Select a media item from your drive and upload it.
    5. The media item will be added to your Media Library and you can
       embed it in posts and pages now.

   The Media Library also lets you edit images from within WordPress —
   cropping, resizing, scaling – you name it. A blog post isn’t complete
   without a few relevant images to go with it!

Adding a User

   Seeing that you’re a dedicated blogger and are in high hopes of taking
   your blogging site to better frontiers (after all, you have made it
   this far down the post), there will come a time when you’ll need some
   outside help or in other words, you’ll want to outsource some of your
   work.

   Whether it’s to manage the technical side of your website or to add a
   few regular authors to your team, the best way to go about it is to add
   user accounts. WordPress enables admins to add users to their site
   which allows them restricted access to the blog’s back end (depending
   upon the user’s role).
   Add New User form.

   Fill out the Add New User form and select a user role.
    1. On the WordPress Dashboard, hover over Users and click Add New.
       (Users > Add New)
    2. The Add New User screen will appear and you will be prompted to add
       some personal details of the user you intend to add.
    3. Once you’ve filled out the details, select a user role from the
       drop-down menu e.g. Admin, Author, Editor, etc.
    4. Click Add New User.

   Your new user will be added to your site and they’ll receive an
   automated email containing their login information.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 5

Add Useful Plugins

   Want to add a new feature to your blog? There’s a plugin for that!
   Plugins are ways to extend and add to the functionality that already
   exists in WordPress.

   Plugins can be thought of as tiny apps that enhance your blog’s
   functionality. WordPress has a ton of plugins, both free and premium,
   for you to select from. In fact, there’s a whole official WordPress
   Repository full of freebies that you should definitely check out.

How to Add Plugins

   Adding plugins to your WordPress blog is quite simple.
   Add New Plugin screen.

   Adding plugins to enhance functionality.
    1. Navigate to the WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Plugins menu
       item and click Add New. (Plugins > Add New)
    2. On the Add Plugins screen, you’ll find that you can upload plugins
       or search for free plugins using the search box located in the
       top-right corner of the screen.
    3. Once you’ve selected a plugin to install, click the Install Now
       button.
    4. Activate the plugin after it’s been installed.

   Installing plugins is quite unchallenging and after tinkering with
   their settings you can start using them immediately.

A Word to the Wise

   Take it from a plugin hoarder, it’s very easy to become addicted to
   installing and storing plugins to your blog site. I mean they’re so
   cool and there’s so many of them and they do so many cool things.

   One thing you need to remember is that you don’t have unlimited space
   on your server. Now 50 GB is more than enough to get your blog off the
   ground but it’s not enough for you to store hundreds of activated
   plugins on. I strongly suggest that you evaluate your blog’s needs and
   make a list of the most essential plugins it requires to deliver value
   to your readership.

   Instead of getting labeled as a plugin hoarder like me, thoroughly
   assess your desire every time you get the itch to install a new plugin.
   Believe me, it’ll save you a ton of space and your blog won’t slow
   down.

Some Essential Plugins

   Having said all of that, there are some plugins that you should install
   without question.
     * A contact form plugin — Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms both work
       great.
     * A caching plugin — I’d recommend W3 Total Cache; it’s blazing fast!
     * An SEO plugin — Yoast SEO is hands down the best SEO plugin. There
       really is no competition.
     * Kiwi Social Sharing WordPress Plugin — Kiwi gives you tons of
       options and it’s super easy to use.
     * The Jetpack plugin — you can activate / deactivate its modules as
       per your requirement.

   Without a doubt, these plugins are essential to running a successful
   blog and you can install most of them free of charge. Fore more useful
   pluguins you can read our essential WordPress plugin guide.

Wrapping It Up

   There’s definitely a lot more to blogging than what this guide covers.
   Hopefully, we’ve provided you with enough information to get started
   with setting up your very own WordPress blog from scratch. We encourage
   you to explore WordPress further and leverage the powerful content
   management system to its full potential.

30 Top Websites & Blogs That Are Powered By WordPress

     * 21 Comments

   WordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems,
   especially for the non-tech savvy. I’ve boasted on several occasions
   that you can create WordPress sites and handle a reasonably high amount
   of traffic. Apart from its remarkable user friendliness, you can use
   WordPress for a multitude of purposes.

   Now it is time to test that boast. I’m going to list a few of the
   world’s most visited websites which run on WordPress.

   Please note, some of these websites may not rank as highly as you might
   expect on Alexa. If that is the case for any particular website here,
   it happens to cover a niche that isn’t as popular or there aren’t any
   better WordPress websites in the particular niche.

   The reasoning or the motivation behind this post is to not only
   demonstrate the power of WordPress in terms of ability to create
   high/medium traffic sites, but also to demonstrate WordPress’s
   usability across a wide spectrum of possible purposes and to show how
   organizations, corporations, small businesses, non profits, pop stars
   and athletes use WordPress for their on-line platforms.

   In no particular order, here are some awesome websites which run on
   WordPress.

Quartz

   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog
   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog

   An awesome news outlet born in 2012 to deliver business news across the
   world and cover every aspect of the new global economy. This website
   was created and designed to meet the needs of the modern web, where
   people reading the news are constantly on the move. Thus, it naturally
   looks great on tablets and mobile phones.

   Quartz is an excellent source of credible information with a great
   emphasis on digital storytelling as opposed to how traditional news
   sources operate. The website itself was designed so as to bring the
   benefits of the web and deliver it with the elegance of an application.

   The website is minimal, as are the menus; there is little to no
   distraction and the website enhances readability. A single full-screen
   image dominates individual posts. These posts provide an initial
   perspective and a glimpse into the topic of the post. But what follows
   after it is great content with well chosen typography and few images.

   The website also seems to operate on an infinite scroll, which is great
   for reading continually. It reduces the burden on menus for navigation
   of the site.

The New Yorker

   the-new-yorker-website the-new-yorker-website

   A weekly magazine which provides a melange of news on international
   affairs, popular culture, arts, business, science, technology and
   politics. And to top it off, they also report on poetry, humor and
   cartoons. Again, the theme here seems to be the same; the website can
   easily be viewed on mobile devices. The magazine is available for
   mobile readers via an app, which can be found in the App Store, on
   Amazon, and Google Play.

   A traditional magazine relies on subscriptions for revenue, as does The
   New Yorker. They have digital, print and a combination plan, which
   helps them generate revenue. The digital plan is a lot better option
   than the print edition. That is because you’ll have access to their
   complete digital archives which goes all the way back to 1925.
   Subscribers can access content based on their membership. Basically,
   you can login to access premium content from anywhere in the world.

   The website’s menu is a whole lot larger than Quartz, as you might
   imagine given the breadth of topics that it covers. The website is
   dotted with imagery of all sizes, and yet there is a lot of white space
   on the site. The publishing mechanism that WordPress provides makes it
   possible for creative writers and artists to publish content via normal
   written content, podcasts, videos, slideshows and interactive graphics
   easily.

BBC America

   bbc-america-wordpress-site bbc-america-wordpress-site

   BBC America brings the best of entertainment, including natural
   history, movies, sci-fi and drama. Ever heard of Doctor Who,
   Broadchurch, Man versus Wild or Orphan Black? Well, BBC America brought
   to you those shows.

   A lot of the content on the website is primarily about TV shows of
   different genres. In addition, great depth provides scheduling
   information; there’s a lot of video content in the form of teasers, and
   plenty of blog content about the TV shows and the entertainment
   business.

   There is also a shopping tab among the menu options. It permits the
   purchase of TV series like Top Gear and Sherlock. Although, I must
   point out that this leads to a BBC sister site, which does not run on
   WordPress.

   In all likelihood, the followers of TV series use the website more as
   reference to keep track of the timings of their favorite shows and
   their release dates. And the website’s scheduling information structure
   might support that claim; it is well built and intuitive to handle. In
   fact, the schedule page of BBC America seems to be running on Thematic,
   which is a free WordPress theme.

   This website is genuinely multifaceted, and delivers a multitude of
   content types. A lot of the content also seems to link back to the
   mother site of BBC, which creates a traffic loop. There is a menu atop
   the website with a wide spectrum of topics, which links back to BBC’s
   primary news website.

Time Inc.

   timeinc-website timeinc-website

   Time Inc., one of the most well known brands in the world. Let me put
   this into perspective: nearly 50% of the population of the United
   States will engage with a Time Inc. brand in a month. And they run
   their website on WordPress. Although, some of their brands may have
   other content management systems working in tandem with WordPress, or
   may run on a non-WordPress platform.

   That being said, it should take anything away from the fact that
   WordPress is incredibly versatile and can be used by a corporation that
   controls such a sizable portion of the media we consume. The website is
   largely descriptive of the Time brand and the brands they have in their
   diverse portfolio.

   You’ll find on the site what you might expect from any reasonably sized
   company. There is a great deal of information about their leadership,
   company profile, history, corporate social responsibility, investment
   information and career opportunities. They even report their quarterly
   earnings in the first page, as you might expect from any corporation
   whose primary motive is to make money for the shareholders.

   But in comparison to most corporate websites, this one is not in the
   least bit dry or boring. As you can see above, the imagery is excellent
   and greatly distracts us from the fact that it is a website of a pretty
   big corporate entity.

Time.com

   time-news-magazine-website time-news-magazine-website

   A brand owned by Time Inc.,Time magazine is one of the most widely
   recognized and read magazines in the world. A readership of around 25
   million strong and as of 2012, the eleventh most circulated magazine in
   the United States.

   The website is what you might expect from a news outlet, the site
   design is based on a side menu. The website uses a lot of red
   especially in the navigation options and unlike previous websites,
   there is little empty white space. The emphasis is far more on
   delivering news content as quickly as possible, there are also articles
   with great insightful depth in the magazine. Although, when you compare
   the website to Quartz, there is definitely less of an emphasis on
   readability.

   They publish on pretty much every topic you can imagine and the landing
   page has a lot of content on it. Images the site uses, some large and
   some thumbnails accompany the various articles on the site.

   As you can imagine such a website probably has a great number of
   authors and full time staff. It must certainly help to have WordPress,
   when publishing so much content produced by a number of authors and
   then checked by multiple editors. They also work on a subscription
   model for premium content.

TechCrunch

   techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog

   TechCrunch covers breaking news about the technology sector; they write
   about startups and a plethora of Internet products. Micheal Arrington
   starts this website to share information about new companies that were
   changing technology.

   The website menu is relatively simple, and the content itself, which is
   largely text, some images & video, is presented in a grid-like format
   working in tandem with a timeline system. Said grid displays posts
   according to publish time. Since the emphasis lies in creating content
   about breakthroughs before anyone else, the timeline format is ideal
   for presenting content.

   There’s also a purely video-based section on the site, which is
   dedicated to delivering new tech, interviews with tech industry experts
   & innovators and product reviews. TechCrunch is also well-known for its
   startup battlefield, which is dedicated to information on startups and
   their funding.

IFC

   ifc-entertainment-site ifc-entertainment-site

   IFC is a website dedicated to the entertainment industry with a focus
   on drama and comedy. It holds a lot of scheduling information which are
   easily accessible for visitors. The site also hosts information on
   movies, two blogs and some video content. IFC is unlike most websites
   where more white space is preferred; the site’s background is black,
   and the typography is bold and black, against a light blue background.

007

   007-james-bond-wordpress-site 007-james-bond-wordpress-site

   One of the most stylish, suave characters to have ever existed, James
   Bond is not just a spy; the character has been a lot more, and
   represents a regal elegance which you might only associate with the
   choicest of brands. So creating a website for the famous 007 character
   requires an equal amount of sophistication in design.

   The site’s design is, as you might expect, regal, to say the least.
   There are three colors involved here: one’s the site’s background, the
   text’s background, and the text itself. There is a lot of white space,
   while the white text is placed against a black background.

   The website is modeled on a portfolio or grid with the images making up
   for what some might consider a lack of color, given the abundance of
   black and white. But the use of only black and white primarily is
   probably what makes this site look great.

   If one were ever concerned whether a WordPress website can be designed
   for luxury brands, then this website is a great example of how awesome
   a WordPress site can be when it falls on the hands of the right
   developer.

Thrive Magazine

   thrive-dark-themed-website thrive-dark-themed-website

   A magazine that reports on sports, fitness, entrepreneurship and
   nutrition. Thrive employs a dark background set against big, white
   text, and a simple primary menu to navigate the website. The site does
   not particularly rank highly, but it does boast a very simple and
   straightforward design.

   I’ve seen many websites use minimal designs with white backgrounds.
   Here’s a rather minimal website that uses a dark background. Besides, a
   website that covers fitness is a good addition to this collection.

Van Heusen

   vanheusen-fashion-website vanheusen-fashion-website

   Yet another brand that is associated with style and regal
   professionalism, very similar to the 007 brand. The website contains a
   ton of information on their various products, loads of images of their
   catalog, and a few videos advertising the inventiveness of their
   clothing line.

The Next Web

   thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog

   If you are like me, you’ve probably followed The Next Web religiously.
   The site covers pretty much anything that comes out of the Internet and
   technology. There is a lot of content about how technology interacts
   with the world as we know it. They discuss money, insights into the
   tech world, and a whole lot of other cool stuff.

   The website is what you might expect from a typical tech website: a lot
   of images with the articles displayed in a grid. The primary menu is
   sticky and always stays on the screen. This is a nice touch for a
   website that generates an enormous amount of content on a daily basis.

Fortune Magazine

   fortune-business-news-magazine fortune-business-news-magazine

   Fortune is yet another well-known magazine from Time, Inc. The website
   is rather crowded with content, and there is lot less space for each
   single article or post on the homepage. This is normal on websites
   where the rate of content generation is very high and there are a great
   number of news stories worth reporting on in a small duration of time.

   A very purposeful website created to bring breaking news and insightful
   articles from the world of business.

ProBlogger

   problogger-website problogger-website

   One of my favorite websites, an absolutely great read for any freelance
   writer or Internet marketer. The website has a blog, podcast content,
   ebooks and an incredibly popular job board.

   You may not think much of the site’s design, but you’ll be amazed at
   how successful the website has been when it comes to connecting with
   audiences and attracting the right type of visitors. This is a fairly
   straightforward approach when creating what is essentially a blog that
   offers professional advice, tutorials and tips. The simplicity probably
   has a great deal to do with their success.

StartUp Weekend

   startup-weekend-by-google startup-weekend-by-google

   A well-designed website as you might expect, the menu is rather quirky
   in the form of cloud bubbles. The website is a little more than a
   landing page with some extra content regarding the event details of
   startup meets. But as far as its function which revolves around event
   management is concerned, the website is more than adequate and performs
   the job quite well.

Smithsonian National Museum Of African Art

   africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site

   You can find all sorts of content on this website, including a ton of
   amazing images and information about events and educational programs.
   While the website might not fall into the category of being a corporate
   website, it certainly has a regal definition tempered by flair and
   style that you might find in a website that covers popular social
   culture.

   I certainly wouldn’t have imagined a website for a museum using
   WordPress. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon the
   existence of this particular website.

Beyonce

   beyonce-wordpress-site beyonce-wordpress-site

   Yet another social and cultural icon of our times, a website completely
   dedicated to the artist Beyonce. The website has a lot of work from her
   photography catalogs. Furthermore, big bold large images cover the
   landing page of the site. Also, the side menu is rather large when
   invoked. Overall, it is a pretty awesome site for a great artist.

Usain Bolt

   usain-bolt-wordpress-website usain-bolt-wordpress-website

   If you were ever asked to pick an athlete whose performance is beyond
   comparison in his or her field, Bolt would certainly be among the
   contenders. The Jamaican sprinter’s website is dedicated to his
   athletic achievements and contains a lot of images. It boasts a full
   screen slider followed by a news stream, reporting his most recent
   sporting feats and his other adventures.

Invisible Children

   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website
   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website

   Invisible Children is a great website albeit about a sad topic. The
   website is the front for an NGO that fights for the rights of children
   who have been entrenched in the LRA and abducted for the purpose of
   serving as child soldiers.

   The website itself is brilliant in terms of its user interface and has
   the right functionality to help combat and save as many children as
   possible.

AMC

   amc-movie-wordpress-site amc-movie-wordpress-site

   The website for AMC, the makers of “The Walking Dead” and many other
   incredibly popular shows. AMC has a lot of powerful, full screen
   imagery intended to capture the curiosity and attention of prospective
   audiences to their TV shows. They also have a schedule information
   section, a blog and a shopping section.

Google Ventures

   google-ventures-wordpress-website google-ventures-wordpress-website

   Minimalism at its best. The menu structure and icons it employ for
   navigation are great; there is very little in the way of distraction on
   their pages. Google Ventures primarily tells the story of how they’ve
   helped startups grow and scale. Their website also provides extensive
   information on the startups they’ve funded.

The Rolling Stones

   rollingstones-band-website rollingstones-band-website

   One of the most well-known bands and/or brands in the music industry
   for more than half century, their website uses WordPress. The website
   has a lot of pink against a blue background and lots of videos, given
   the nature of the content you might expect. That is true at least on
   the landing page. But, if you explore the website a bit more, you’ll
   also find a lot of text content equally and well presented.

Outbrain

   outbrain-business-website outbrain-business-website

   A professional content discovery service that makes more than 200
   billion recommendations on a daily basis. The well-desinged website has
   a few full-screen images and uses the color orange very effectively
   indeed. There is very little text on the homepage and a menu that is as
   small as can be. The site is also incredibly easy to navigate.

Wired

   wired-business-news-website wired-business-news-website

   Wired is a magazine that brings you tomorrow’s technologies today.
   Their main website has a lot of content and a pretty large menu with a
   ton of options to choose from. It also uses a partial grid system in
   conjunction with side bars displaying a content stream of new
   information, as new ones are generated on the website.

   We’ve seen so many websites ranging from corporations, small online
   businesses to non profit organizations and magazines leveraging
   WordPress as a means to publish content on the Internet. But WordPress
   is also used as a blog, and it is an awesome platform for your average
   blog.

   But hold on, it isn’t just the average blog that uses WordPress. There
   are a great number of websites that use WordPress to run their blogs.
   Let’s have a look at a few of the best!

Sony

   sony-official-news-blog sony-official-news-blog

   A very large corporate brand in the electronics and gaming industry
   renown for its gaming consoles and smart phones. Their official blog
   runs on the WordPress platform; there is not much in the way of style
   in the website. The site has been designed to add a lot of text content
   about their products and various product specifications. There is a
   humongous archive with a lot of information on their various products
   stretching back to 2007.

Play Station Blog

   playstation-games-news-site playstation-games-news-site

   The website is pretty awesome with a portfolio/grid approach to video
   and image rich content. They’ve packed in a lot of images into a very
   small space at the top of the site. Moreover, as you scroll down, the
   site is divided into two columns, with large video content bearing
   individual posts.

TED Blog

   ted-simple-wordpress-blog ted-simple-wordpress-blog

   TED is another non-profit organization that leverages the power of
   WordPress to communicate ideas via the web. The website employs a menu
   with not too many options, followed by a full-screen article post and a
   two-column grid with more recently published articles. They also have
   quite an extensive footer. It directs you to the various TED programs
   and communication channels for interacting with TED.

Rackspace

   rackspace-cloud-platform-website rackspace-cloud-platform-website

   Rackspace is a WordPress blog, and is one of the leadings provider of
   raw computing infrastructure. A simple blog with with the posts divided
   into featured and latest posts. Obviously, as the blog of a service
   provider, there are a lot of link-backs to their services and their
   mother site.

Official LinkedIn Blog

   linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog

   Yes, the most used professional social network’s blog runs on
   WordPress. The website is designed for one purpose, and that is made
   abundantly clear from the onset. Most of the content on the blog
   focuses on human resources, talent management and hiring practices
   across the globe.

SAP News Center

   sap-news-center sap-news-center

   SAP is a multinational corporation that creates software for enterprise
   resource planning among others. Their blog delivers news from their
   various undertakings from all their divisions in different countries.

Facebook Newsroom

   facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme

   The world’s most popular social network’s official blog runs on
   WordPress. The site is minimal and has one large image/video on a
   slider system . It is then followed by simple plain text news with no
   thumbnails. Fairly simple site but remarkably readable as you might
   expect.

Final Thoughts

   I hope I’ve amply demonstrated how WordPress can be used and how wide a
   spectrum of purposes/businesses/niches WordPress can handle. It is very
   unlikely that the site you want to create can not be best achieved with
   WordPress as the Content Management System.

   waiting for – you have a wealth of knowledge available here on Colorlib

       Hi Thanks for your tips.
       I agree that if you want to increase traffic to your site or wish
       the targeted audience grew, there are plenty of steps that you, a
       blogger, can follow in order to improve your website traffic and
       audience.
       The first step would be to write a blog every day. (Make it a
       habit!)
       Then, you could use a website tracking tool such as Google
       Analytics to monitor activity on your blog – web visitors, clicks,
       and conversions, etc.
       Next, you could use social media to drive traffic to your site.
       Fourth, include effective call to action to increase repeat
       visitors.
       Lastly, if you know the basics of on-page SEO and off-page SEO as
       well, then you should see significant number of traffic to your
       site!

            Rachel,
            WordPress is not longer used just to create a simple WordPress
            blogs. It is used by millions of websites and many of theme
            are highly trafficked ones.

       I didn’t expect some of the sites on this list to be running
       WordPress lol. Especially AMC, LinkedIn and Playstation to name a
       few! Shows you just how powerful WordPress is at the present. I
       actually use WordPress for my personal blogs, I used Blogger a
       while back but switched to WordPress since it was a lot easier to
       use.

       This is true that WordPress is most popular framework, being used
       to develop personal websites as well as professional and corporate
       level websites.

       I love this article! I use WordPress for my website, but I have not
       integrated a blog section quite yet. I am genuinely surprised that
       these websites use WordPress. Keep up the good work!

       Great article! And by the way, The Rolling Stones are absolute
       music legends. WordPress should be paying them to use their site!

            Chani,
            They are using a WordPress just like we are and we aren’t
            paying for it nor receiving any money that we use it. So I see
            no reason why The Rolling Stones should be treated
            differently.

             30 Top Websites & Blogs That Are Powered By WordPress

   Vishnu

   4 months ago

   WordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems,
   especially for the non-tech savvy. I’ve boasted on several occasions
   that you can create WordPress sites and handle a reasonably high amount
   of traffic. Apart from its remarkable user friendliness, you can use
   WordPress for a multitude of purposes.

   Now it is time to test that boast. I’m going to list a few of the
   world’s most visited websites which run on WordPress.

   Please note, some of these websites may not rank as highly as you might
   expect on Alexa. If that is the case for any particular website here,
   it happens to cover a niche that isn’t as popular or there aren’t any
   better WordPress websites in the particular niche.

   The reasoning or the motivation behind this post is to not only
   demonstrate the power of WordPress in terms of ability to create
   high/medium traffic sites, but also to demonstrate WordPress’s
   usability across a wide spectrum of possible purposes and to show how
   organizations, corporations, small businesses, non profits, pop stars
   and athletes use WordPress for their on-line platforms.

   In no particular order, here are some awesome websites which run on
   WordPress.

Quartz

   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog

   An awesome news outlet born in 2012 to deliver business news across the
   world and cover every aspect of the new global economy. This website
   was created and designed to meet the needs of the modern web, where
   people reading the news are constantly on the move. Thus, it naturally
   looks great on tablets and mobile phones.

   Quartz is an excellent source of credible information with a great
   emphasis on digital storytelling as opposed to how traditional news
   sources operate. The website itself was designed so as to bring the
   benefits of the web and deliver it with the elegance of an application.

   The website is minimal, as are the menus; there is little to no
   distraction and the website enhances readability. A single full-screen
   image dominates individual posts. These posts provide an initial
   perspective and a glimpse into the topic of the post. But what follows
   after it is great content with well chosen typography and few images.

   The website also seems to operate on an infinite scroll, which is great
   for reading continually. It reduces the burden on menus for navigation
   of the site.

The New Yorker

   the-new-yorker-website

   A weekly magazine which provides a melange of news on international
   affairs, popular culture, arts, business, science, technology and
   politics. And to top it off, they also report on poetry, humor and
   cartoons. Again, the theme here seems to be the same; the website can
   easily be viewed on mobile devices. The magazine is available for
   mobile readers via an app, which can be found in the App Store, on
   Amazon, and Google Play.

   A traditional magazine relies on subscriptions for revenue, as does The
   New Yorker. They have digital, print and a combination plan, which
   helps them generate revenue. The digital plan is a lot better option
   than the print edition. That is because you’ll have access to their
   complete digital archives which goes all the way back to 1925.
   Subscribers can access content based on their membership. Basically,
   you can login to access premium content from anywhere in the world.

   The website’s menu is a whole lot larger than Quartz, as you might
   imagine given the breadth of topics that it covers. The website is
   dotted with imagery of all sizes, and yet there is a lot of white space
   on the site. The publishing mechanism that WordPress provides makes it
   possible for creative writers and artists to publish content via normal
   written content, podcasts, videos, slideshows and interactive graphics
   easily.

BBC America

   bbc-america-wordpress-site

   BBC America brings the best of entertainment, including natural
   history, movies, sci-fi and drama. Ever heard of Doctor Who,
   Broadchurch, Man versus Wild or Orphan Black? Well, BBC America brought
   to you those shows.

   A lot of the content on the website is primarily about TV shows of
   different genres. In addition, great depth provides scheduling
   information; there’s a lot of video content in the form of teasers, and
   plenty of blog content about the TV shows and the entertainment
   business.

   There is also a shopping tab among the menu options. It permits the
   purchase of TV series like Top Gear and Sherlock. Although, I must
   point out that this leads to a BBC sister site, which does not run on
   WordPress.

   In all likelihood, the followers of TV series use the website more as
   reference to keep track of the timings of their favorite shows and
   their release dates. And the website’s scheduling information structure
   might support that claim; it is well built and intuitive to handle. In
   fact, the schedule page of BBC America seems to be running on Thematic,
   which is a free WordPress theme.

   This website is genuinely multifaceted, and delivers a multitude of
   content types. A lot of the content also seems to link back to the
   mother site of BBC, which creates a traffic loop. There is a menu atop
   the website with a wide spectrum of topics, which links back to BBC’s
   primary news website.

Time Inc.

   timeinc-website

   Time Inc., one of the most well known brands in the world. Let me put
   this into perspective: nearly 50% of the population of the United
   States will engage with a Time Inc. brand in a month. And they run
   their website on WordPress. Although, some of their brands may have
   other content management systems working in tandem with WordPress, or
   may run on a non-WordPress platform.

   That being said, it should take anything away from the fact that
   WordPress is incredibly versatile and can be used by a corporation that
   controls such a sizable portion of the media we consume. The website is
   largely descriptive of the Time brand and the brands they have in their
   diverse portfolio.

   You’ll find on the site what you might expect from any reasonably sized
   company. There is a great deal of information about their leadership,
   company profile, history, corporate social responsibility, investment
   information and career opportunities. They even report their quarterly
   earnings in the first page, as you might expect from any corporation
   whose primary motive is to make money for the shareholders.

   But in comparison to most corporate websites, this one is not in the
   least bit dry or boring. As you can see above, the imagery is excellent
   and greatly distracts us from the fact that it is a website of a pretty
   big corporate entity.

Time.com

   time-news-magazine-website

   A brand owned by Time Inc.,Time magazine is one of the most widely
   recognized and read magazines in the world. A readership of around 25
   million strong and as of 2012, the eleventh most circulated magazine in
   the United States.

   The website is what you might expect from a news outlet, the site
   design is based on a side menu. The website uses a lot of red
   especially in the navigation options and unlike previous websites,
   there is little empty white space. The emphasis is far more on
   delivering news content as quickly as possible, there are also articles
   with great insightful depth in the magazine. Although, when you compare
   the website to Quartz, there is definitely less of an emphasis on
   readability.

   They publish on pretty much every topic you can imagine and the landing
   page has a lot of content on it. Images the site uses, some large and
   some thumbnails accompany the various articles on the site.

   As you can imagine such a website probably has a great number of
   authors and full time staff. It must certainly help to have WordPress,
   when publishing so much content produced by a number of authors and
   then checked by multiple editors. They also work on a subscription
   model for premium content.

TechCrunch

   techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog

   TechCrunch covers breaking news about the technology sector; they write
   about startups and a plethora of Internet products. Micheal Arrington
   starts this website to share information about new companies that were
   changing technology.

   The website menu is relatively simple, and the content itself, which is
   largely text, some images & video, is presented in a grid-like format
   working in tandem with a timeline system. Said grid displays posts
   according to publish time. Since the emphasis lies in creating content
   about breakthroughs before anyone else, the timeline format is ideal
   for presenting content.

   There’s also a purely video-based section on the site, which is
   dedicated to delivering new tech, interviews with tech industry experts
   & innovators and product reviews. TechCrunch is also well-known for its
   startup battlefield, which is dedicated to information on startups and
   their funding.

IFC

   ifc-entertainment-site

   IFC is a website dedicated to the entertainment industry with a focus
   on drama and comedy. It holds a lot of scheduling information which are
   easily accessible for visitors. The site also hosts information on
   movies, two blogs and some video content. IFC is unlike most websites
   where more white space is preferred; the site’s background is black,
   and the typography is bold and black, against a light blue background.

007

   007-james-bond-wordpress-site

   One of the most stylish, suave characters to have ever existed, James
   Bond is not just a spy; the character has been a lot more, and
   represents a regal elegance which you might only associate with the
   choicest of brands. So creating a website for the famous 007 character
   requires an equal amount of sophistication in design.

   The site’s design is, as you might expect, regal, to say the least.
   There are three colors involved here: one’s the site’s background, the
   text’s background, and the text itself. There is a lot of white space,
   while the white text is placed against a black background.

   The website is modeled on a portfolio or grid with the images making up
   for what some might consider a lack of color, given the abundance of
   black and white. But the use of only black and white primarily is
   probably what makes this site look great.

   If one were ever concerned whether a WordPress website can be designed
   for luxury brands, then this website is a great example of how awesome
   a WordPress site can be when it falls on the hands of the right
   developer.

Thrive Magazine

   thrive-dark-themed-website

   A magazine that reports on sports, fitness, entrepreneurship and
   nutrition. Thrive employs a dark background set against big, white
   text, and a simple primary menu to navigate the website. The site does
   not particularly rank highly, but it does boast a very simple and
   straightforward design.

   I’ve seen many websites use minimal designs with white backgrounds.
   Here’s a rather minimal website that uses a dark background. Besides, a
   website that covers fitness is a good addition to this collection.

Van Heusen

   vanheusen-fashion-website

   Yet another brand that is associated with style and regal
   professionalism, very similar to the 007 brand. The website contains a
   ton of information on their various products, loads of images of their
   catalog, and a few videos advertising the inventiveness of their
   clothing line.

The Next Web

   thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog

   If you are like me, you’ve probably followed The Next Web religiously.
   The site covers pretty much anything that comes out of the Internet and
   technology. There is a lot of content about how technology interacts
   with the world as we know it. They discuss money, insights into the
   tech world, and a whole lot of other cool stuff.

   The website is what you might expect from a typical tech website: a lot
   of images with the articles displayed in a grid. The primary menu is
   sticky and always stays on the screen. This is a nice touch for a
   website that generates an enormous amount of content on a daily basis.

Fortune Magazine

   fortune-business-news-magazine

   Fortune is yet another well-known magazine from Time, Inc. The website
   is rather crowded with content, and there is lot less space for each
   single article or post on the homepage. This is normal on websites
   where the rate of content generation is very high and there are a great
   number of news stories worth reporting on in a small duration of time.

   A very purposeful website created to bring breaking news and insightful
   articles from the world of business.

ProBlogger

   problogger-website

   One of my favorite websites, an absolutely great read for any freelance
   writer or Internet marketer. The website has a blog, podcast content,
   ebooks and an incredibly popular job board.

   You may not think much of the site’s design, but you’ll be amazed at
   how successful the website has been when it comes to connecting with
   audiences and attracting the right type of visitors. This is a fairly
   straightforward approach when creating what is essentially a blog that
   offers professional advice, tutorials and tips. The simplicity probably
   has a great deal to do with their success.

StartUp Weekend

   startup-weekend-by-google

   A well-designed website as you might expect, the menu is rather quirky
   in the form of cloud bubbles. The website is a little more than a
   landing page with some extra content regarding the event details of
   startup meets. But as far as its function which revolves around event
   management is concerned, the website is more than adequate and performs
   the job quite well.

Smithsonian National Museum Of African Art

   africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site

   You can find all sorts of content on this website, including a ton of
   amazing images and information about events and educational programs.
   While the website might not fall into the category of being a corporate
   website, it certainly has a regal definition tempered by flair and
   style that you might find in a website that covers popular social
   culture.

   I certainly wouldn’t have imagined a website for a museum using
   WordPress. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon the
   existence of this particular website.

Beyonce

   beyonce-wordpress-site

   Yet another social and cultural icon of our times, a website completely
   dedicated to the artist Beyonce. The website has a lot of work from her
   photography catalogs. Furthermore, big bold large images cover the
   landing page of the site. Also, the side menu is rather large when
   invoked. Overall, it is a pretty awesome site for a great artist.

Usain Bolt

   usain-bolt-wordpress-website

   If you were ever asked to pick an athlete whose performance is beyond
   comparison in his or her field, Bolt would certainly be among the
   contenders. The Jamaican sprinter’s website is dedicated to his
   athletic achievements and contains a lot of images. It boasts a full
   screen slider followed by a news stream, reporting his most recent
   sporting feats and his other adventures.

Invisible Children

   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website

   Invisible Children is a great website albeit about a sad topic. The
   website is the front for an NGO that fights for the rights of children
   who have been entrenched in the LRA and abducted for the purpose of
   serving as child soldiers.

   The website itself is brilliant in terms of its user interface and has
   the right functionality to help combat and save as many children as
   possible.

AMC

   amc-movie-wordpress-site

   The website for AMC, the makers of “The Walking Dead” and many other
   incredibly popular shows. AMC has a lot of powerful, full screen
   imagery intended to capture the curiosity and attention of prospective
   audiences to their TV shows. They also have a schedule information
   section, a blog and a shopping section.

Google Ventures

   google-ventures-wordpress-website

   Minimalism at its best. The menu structure and icons it employ for
   navigation are great; there is very little in the way of distraction on
   their pages. Google Ventures primarily tells the story of how they’ve
   helped startups grow and scale. Their website also provides extensive
   information on the startups they’ve funded.

The Rolling Stones

   rollingstones-band-website

   One of the most well-known bands and/or brands in the music industry
   for more than half century, their website uses WordPress. The website
   has a lot of pink against a blue background and lots of videos, given
   the nature of the content you might expect. That is true at least on
   the landing page. But, if you explore the website a bit more, you’ll
   also find a lot of text content equally and well presented.

Outbrain

   outbrain-business-website

   A professional content discovery service that makes more than 200
   billion recommendations on a daily basis. The well-desinged website has
   a few full-screen images and uses the color orange very effectively
   indeed. There is very little text on the homepage and a menu that is as
   small as can be. The site is also incredibly easy to navigate.

Wired

   wired-business-news-website

   Wired is a magazine that brings you tomorrow’s technologies today.
   Their main website has a lot of content and a pretty large menu with a
   ton of options to choose from. It also uses a partial grid system in
   conjunction with side bars displaying a content stream of new
   information, as new ones are generated on the website.

   We’ve seen so many websites ranging from corporations, small online
   businesses to non profit organizations and magazines leveraging
   WordPress as a means to publish content on the Internet. But WordPress
   is also used as a blog, and it is an awesome platform for your average
   blog.

   But hold on, it isn’t just the average blog that uses WordPress. There
   are a great number of websites that use WordPress to run their blogs.
   Let’s have a look at a few of the best!

Sony

   sony-official-news-blog

   A very large corporate brand in the electronics and gaming industry
   renown for its gaming consoles and smart phones. Their official blog
   runs on the WordPress platform; there is not much in the way of style
   in the website. The site has been designed to add a lot of text content
   about their products and various product specifications. There is a
   humongous archive with a lot of information on their various products
   stretching back to 2007.

Play Station Blog

   playstation-games-news-site

   The website is pretty awesome with a portfolio/grid approach to video
   and image rich content. They’ve packed in a lot of images into a very
   small space at the top of the site. Moreover, as you scroll down, the
   site is divided into two columns, with large video content bearing
   individual posts.

TED Blog

   ted-simple-wordpress-blog

   TED is another non-profit organization that leverages the power of
   WordPress to communicate ideas via the web. The website employs a menu
   with not too many options, followed by a full-screen article post and a
   two-column grid with more recently published articles. They also have
   quite an extensive footer. It directs you to the various TED programs
   and communication channels for interacting with TED.

Rackspace

   rackspace-cloud-platform-website

   Rackspace is a WordPress blog, and is one of the leadings provider of
   raw computing infrastructure. A simple blog with with the posts divided
   into featured and latest posts. Obviously, as the blog of a service
   provider, there are a lot of link-backs to their services and their
   mother site.

Official LinkedIn Blog

   linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog

   Yes, the most used professional social network’s blog runs on
   WordPress. The website is designed for one purpose, and that is made
   abundantly clear from the onset. Most of the content on the blog
   focuses on human resources, talent management and hiring practices
   across the globe.

SAP News Center

   sap-news-center

   SAP is a multinational corporation that creates software for enterprise
   resource planning among others. Their blog delivers news from their
   various undertakings from all their divisions in different countries.

Facebook Newsroom

   facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme

   The world’s most popular social network’s official blog runs on
   WordPress. The site is minimal and has one large image/video on a
   slider system . It is then followed by simple plain text news with no
   thumbnails. Fairly simple site but remarkably readable as you might
   expect.

Final Thoughts

   I hope I’ve amply demonstrated how WordPress can be used and how wide a
   spectrum of purposes/businesses/niches WordPress can handle. It is very
   unlikely that the site you want to create can not be best achieved with
   WordPress as the Content Management System.

   If you are yet to create your first website or blog what are you
   waiting for – you have a wealth of knowledge available here on Colorlib
   and across the web to help you do just that.

How to Start a Blog From Scratch – A Comprehensive Guide

   Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past decade or so,
   you’ve probably noticed the sudden increase in blogging websites.

   Regardless of the nature of your business, setting up a web presence is
   more important than ever before. And once you’ve got your website in
   place, you’ll need a blog to go with it – after all, blogging is
   perhaps one of the most powerful tools you can leverage to boost sales,
   attract new customers and build brand credibility with existing
   clients.

   With all of this in mind, we’ve decided to put together a comprehensive
   yet simple-to-follow step by step guide to help you create your very
   own blog from scratch. In this article, you’ll find everything you need
   from purchasing a domain name to selecting a hosting provider and
   installing software to publishing your first blog post.

   Let’s get started building your first blog!

5 Steps to Start a Blog

   Let me start off by saying that you don’t need to be programming
   literate to follow this practical guide – in fact, you won’t have to
   write a single line of code. To those of you who shy away from the mere
   thought of coding (don’t worry; I’m no stranger in that community!) I
   say “Fear not, for this guide is with you.”

   I’ll walk you through five simple steps to help you launch your blog:
    1. Choose a Blogging Platform
    2. Choose Suitable Hosting
    3. Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting
    4. Customize Your Blog
    5. Add Useful Plugins

   Now that we’ve gotten all of the preliminary details out of the ways,
   let’s jump right into the tutorial. You’ll have it up and running in
   the next 15 minutes – I kid you not!
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 1

Choose a Blogging Platform

   The first thing you’ll have to do is select a content management system
   (CMS) that will serve as the underlying platform for your blog. Now
   you’ve probably heard of a few of the major blogging platforms out
   there – WordPress, Blogger, Joomla, Drupal, etc.

WordPress All The Way

   I’m a huge advocate of WordPress and I wholeheartedly recommend it to
   anyone who wants to start their own blog. Here are a few simple reasons
   why:
     * It’s massive. As of the writing of this article, WordPress powers
       nearly 74.6 million websites.
     * It’s absolutely free. WordPress was essentially designed to be an
       open source project.

     * It’s secure and reliable. The dedicated team of developers behind
       WordPress, Automattic, is always updating the CMS to ensure maximum
       safety. If it’s safe enough for NASA, chances are it’s safe enough
       for you.
     * It’s scalable. Whether you want to launch a personal blog or are in
       hopes of a much bigger, CNN-sized site (yes, CNN runs on WordPress,
       too!), you can rest assured that it’ll operate without any
       glitches.

   Those of you who are launching their first blog and probably don’t have
   a ton of potential traffic lined up are far better off opting for
   WordPress. Aside from the platform-specific benefits the CMS offers,
   it’ll save you a ton of time, effort, and money.

   Hosting with WordPress is low-cost and installation takes 5 minutes.
   The best part, however, is and will always be that you don’t need to be
   exceptionally skilled in a web programming language (or even know the
   ABC’s of it) to launch and operate a successful WordPress-based blog.

   If you’re convinced that WordPress really is the best CMS out there,
   let’s move on to the next section.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 2

Choose Suitable Hosting

   Now that you’ve made the right decision in choosing WordPress as your
   CMS, there’s just one more choice to make – choosing a type of hosting
   provider.

   The decision you make at this stage will have a colossal effect on the
   outcome of your blog. You can choose to fork out a couple of dollars
   every month for self-hosting or go for a free alternative instead. And
   although the latter sounds absolutely incredible, that’s not the
   direction you’ll want to head in.

Why You Should Avoid Free Blog Sites

   With free blogging platforms (non-hosted platforms) the disadvantages
   always outnumber the advantages. Always. For starters, you get a
   terrible domain name – something like
   ‘myblog.freebloggingplatform.com’. Your blog’s domain name has a
   significant impact on SEO and social media marketing so if you want
   your blog to really take off and be discoverable then you’ll want to go
   with a self-hosting.

   A .com extension is the standard norm and nearly 75% of all websites
   have it. I’m not saying it’s impossible to attract millions of unique
   monthly page views with a .freebloggingplatform.com extension but how
   many successful bloggers (or any successful site for that matter) do
   you know by that domain name extension?

     “Brand is the sum total of how someone perceives a particular
     organization.”

   You want a web address that rolls off the tongue easily. One that
   people will remember. One that tactfully illustrates your brand and
   communicates what your blog is all about in a concise yet relevant set
   of characters.

Disadvantages of Non-Hosted Blogging Platforms

     * URL Problem. Your blog’s URL will be long, unappealing, and
       unprofessional.
     * No Real Ownership. Since you’re not paying for hosting, your blog
       won’t actually be your blog – it’s hosted on someone else’s web
       property. This means that they can delete it whenever they want.
     * Other Restrictions. Free blogging platforms don’t let you do all
       the cool stuff like monetize your blog, use themes, or install
       plugins. Worst of all, your site’s space on the server is limited
       which means you can’t even upload all of the images and videos you
       were hoping would attract traffic.

   These are factors that most of us simply can’t afford to compromise on.
   They are essential to the timely success of our blog and we’re willing
   to spend a few bucks for it.

   Luckily enough for you, I’ve worked out the most optimal and
   cost-efficient solution after carefully analyzing the hosting industry.
   (It’s a difficult and confusing world to navigate through.) Long story
   short: Bluehost is the winner.

Why Bluehost Is Best

   Bluehost offers everything from shared hosting to optimized hosting for
   WordPress at a reasonable price. Being a first-time webmaster, it’s
   best to go for shared hosting. The rest of them are advanced hosting
   services and more suitable for bigger blogs. You won’t need the kind of
   functionality they offer right away and when you feel like you do, you
   can always upgrade to another hosting plan.

   Bluehost’s Shared Hosting plan is an ideal candidate for several
   reasons:
    1. WordPress users get a special discount price at $3.49/month.
    2. You’ll get a free domain name.
    3. 1-click WordPress install.
    4. 24/7 support.
    5. 30-day money back guarantee.

   It stands to reason that WordPress and Bluehost go hand in hand — the
   best CMS paired with an affordable and reliable hosting provider. In
   the next section, we’ll walk you through a simple procedure to set up
   your domain name and hosting service with Bluehost.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 3

Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting

   Click here to visit the Bluehost homepage to begin setting up your
   first blog. We'll receive a commission if you decided to purchase
   through these links.

   1. On the Bluehost homepage, you’ll find products in the menu bar.
   Hover over it and click on shared hosting.
   Bluehost's products menu.

   Select shared hosting from the products menu.

   2. You will be redirected to a page that gives you a brief overview of
   Bluehost’s shared hosting plan. Click on the green get started now
   button to proceed with the setup.
   Get started now button.

   Get started with shared hosting.

   3. Select your preferred shared hosting plan. We recommend you go with
   the basic plan for now.
   Bluehost's pricing table.

   Select the basic shared hosting plan.

   4. The next page prompts you to select a domain name and domain name
   extension for your blog — the fun (sometimes frustrating) part of the
   whole experience. Click next once you’re done.
   Domain name.

   Enter a domain name.

   5. Once you select a domain name that you like and is available, you’ll
   see a verification message on the next page notifying you that the
   domain is available and you can advance to the next step.

   6. On the same page, you’ll see an account information form that
   requires you to fill out your personal details.
   Bluehost form.

   Fill in your account information.

   7. Once you’ve filled out your account information details, you’ll be
   prompted to select/deselect options for your package in the package
   information form.
   Package information form.

   Tick all the features you’d like to opt for.

   Let’s quickly review the options you can select to enhance the
   functionality and security of your brand new blogging site:
     * Constant Contact. Constant Contact is one of the best tools to
       connect with your audience without hassle. It allows you to create,
       send, and track emails and newsletters to your readership. This
       isn’t mandatory, but if you think that you’ll be sending emails to
       your subscribers regularly then go for it!
     * Domain Privacy Protection. A domain name’s whois information is
       available for anyone to acquire on the Internet. Most of the time,
       marketing companies leverage this information and send a ton of
       unwanted solicitations your way. By selecting this option, the only
       visible information will be Bluehost thus preventing your whois
       information from being publicly available.
     * Site Backup Pro. This feature takes automatic backups of your blog
       regularly. I would strongly recommend that you leave this box
       ticked. Choosing to opt out would mean that you’d have to take
       manual backups using a plugin.
     * Search Engine Jumpstart. Since you’re just starting out with your
       blog, you can leave this box un-ticked. There’s no reason to start
       worrying about search engines just yet.
     * SiteLock Security — Find. This feature isn’t compulsory but it adds
       an additional layer of security to your blogging site. Check out
       the features it offers to determine if it’s right for you.

   Leaving the default options as they are is perfectly fine, too.

   8. The billing information form requires you to fill in your credit
   card number to complete the transaction.
    1. Bluehost accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.
    2. Clicking on the More payment options link enables you to pay
       through your PayPal account.

   Billing information form.

   Enter your credit card information to complete the transaction.
    1. Once you’ve filled in your billing information, tick I confirm I
       have read and agree to the Terms of Service… box and click the
       submit button.

   Submit button to complete transaction.

   Click the submit button once you’ve filled out the forms.

   By now your hosting service and domain name are paid for. In the
   following steps, we’ll login to the Bluehost cPanel and use its 1-click
   WordPress install feature to install the CMS to our blog site.

   9. Using the login details emailed to you by Bluehost, sign in to the
   Bluehost cPanel.

   10. Under the website section on the homepage, click the Install
   WordPress button.
   Bluehost's cPanel.

   1-click WordPress install in Bluehost’s cPanel.

   11. You will be redirected to a new page with information about
   WordPress. Click the green Install button to continue with the
   installation.
   Green install button to complete WordPress installation.

   Click Install to proceed.

   12. On the next screen, select your newly registered domain name (it
   should be selected by default) to let the system know which directory
   you’d like to install WordPress to. Click Check Domain once you’re
   done.
   Selecting installation folder.

   Select your blog’s domain name from the drop-down menu.

   13. All that’s left is to enter your site’s name, your admin username,
   and a password in the next screen and you’re good to go! Click Install
   Now after filling out the form.
   Install button to initiate WordPress installation.

   Click Install!

   Note: Be sure to save your admin username and password in a text file.
   You’ll login to your blog using these credentials.

   Congratulations! By now you’ve successfully:
     * Registered a domain name.
     * Purchased web hosting for your blog.
     * Installed WordPress to your blog.

   14. Login to your blog site by clicking on the Admin URL that looks
   something like http://myblogname.com/wp-admin.
   WordPress Dashboard.

   Your WordPress Dashboard should look something like this.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 4

Customize Your Blog

   In this section, I’ll introduce you to the WordPress Dashboard and help
   you install a theme to increase your blog’s visual appeal.

An Introduction to the WordPress Dashboard

   The WordPress Dashboard can be quite overwhelming for first-time users
   but I promise you’ll get used to it sooner than you think. For the
   purpose of this post, I’ll cover the following items:
     * Activating a Theme
     * Writing Your First Post
     * Exploring the Media Library
     * Adding a User

   Sounds good? Let’s get started.

Activating a Theme

   We’ll start out by installing and activating a WordPress theme to our
   blog. By default, WordPress has its default theme activated (Twenty
   Sixteen as of this writing). We’re going to change the default theme to
   a more sophisticated and contemporary theme designed specifically for
   blogging sites. Enter Activello.

   Activello is a simple, multipurpose blog theme for WordPress designed
   by our exceptionally talented team. It’s got all the right features to
   get you started with a professional and modern-looking blog. Best of
   all it’s free! You can download it from here.
   Install Activello theme

   Upload the theme’s .zip file and click Install Now.
    1. From your WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Appearance menu item
       and click on Themes in the sub-menu. (Appearance > Themes)
    2. Once you’re at the Themes window, click the Add New button at the
       top
    3. Click the Upload Theme button and upload the theme’s .zip file.
    4. Once it’s uploaded, click Install Now.
    5. You will be redirected to a screen that notifies you of the status
       of the installation. Click the Activate link once the theme is
       successfully installed.

   You can leave it be or tweak it if you’d like to change a design aspect
   by navigating to Appearance > Customize. If you’re thinking of setting
   up a niche-specific blog then be sure to check out our complete
   collection of WordPress themes.

Writing Your First Post

   As a blogger, you’ll be writing a ton of posts so it’s important that
   you pay attention to this section to get the basics down.
   Adding a post.

   Post-ception!
    1. Hover over the Posts menu item and click Add New. (Posts > Add New)
    2. You’ll be redirected to the Add New Post screen which looks
       something like this:
    3. Add a suitable title in the text box that says Enter title here.
    4. In the big text editor below, add your post’s content. You’ll find
       that there’s a handy dandy toolbar embedded inside to help you
       format your post.
    5. Click the Publish button once you’re done.

   Voila! The post is published to your blog and everyone can see it now.
   How easy was that?

Exploring the Media Library

   The WordPress Media Library is a powerful tool that you can leverage to
   handle practically all of your media management. It stores all media
   files (images, videos, audio, and documents) that you upload to your
   WordPress blog regardless of whether it’s published or not.
   WordPress Media Library.

   The powerful Media Library.
    1. Click the Media menu item from the WordPress Dashboard.
    2. You will be redirected to the Media Library screen from where you
       can manage all of your media files.
    3. Click the Add New button at the top of the screen.
    4. Select a media item from your drive and upload it.
    5. The media item will be added to your Media Library and you can
       embed it in posts and pages now.

   The Media Library also lets you edit images from within WordPress —
   cropping, resizing, scaling – you name it. A blog post isn’t complete
   without a few relevant images to go with it!

Adding a User

   Seeing that you’re a dedicated blogger and are in high hopes of taking
   your blogging site to better frontiers (after all, you have made it
   this far down the post), there will come a time when you’ll need some
   outside help or in other words, you’ll want to outsource some of your
   work.

   Whether it’s to manage the technical side of your website or to add a
   few regular authors to your team, the best way to go about it is to add
   user accounts. WordPress enables admins to add users to their site
   which allows them restricted access to the blog’s back end (depending
   upon the user’s role).
   Add New User form.

   Fill out the Add New User form and select a user role.
    1. On the WordPress Dashboard, hover over Users and click Add New.
       (Users > Add New)
    2. The Add New User screen will appear and you will be prompted to add
       some personal details of the user you intend to add.
    3. Once you’ve filled out the details, select a user role from the
       drop-down menu e.g. Admin, Author, Editor, etc.
    4. Click Add New User.

   Your new user will be added to your site and they’ll receive an
   automated email containing their login information.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 5

Add Useful Plugins

   Want to add a new feature to your blog? There’s a plugin for that!
   Plugins are ways to extend and add to the functionality that already
   exists in WordPress.

   Plugins can be thought of as tiny apps that enhance your blog’s
   functionality. WordPress has a ton of plugins, both free and premium,
   for you to select from. In fact, there’s a whole official WordPress
   Repository full of freebies that you should definitely check out.

How to Add Plugins

   Adding plugins to your WordPress blog is quite simple.
   Add New Plugin screen.

   Adding plugins to enhance functionality.
    1. Navigate to the WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Plugins menu
       item and click Add New. (Plugins > Add New)
    2. On the Add Plugins screen, you’ll find that you can upload plugins
       or search for free plugins using the search box located in the
       top-right corner of the screen.
    3. Once you’ve selected a plugin to install, click the Install Now
       button.
    4. Activate the plugin after it’s been installed.

   Installing plugins is quite unchallenging and after tinkering with
   their settings you can start using them immediately.

A Word to the Wise

   Take it from a plugin hoarder, it’s very easy to become addicted to
   installing and storing plugins to your blog site. I mean they’re so
   cool and there’s so many of them and they do so many cool things.

   One thing you need to remember is that you don’t have unlimited space
   on your server. Now 50 GB is more than enough to get your blog off the
   ground but it’s not enough for you to store hundreds of activated
   plugins on. I strongly suggest that you evaluate your blog’s needs and
   make a list of the most essential plugins it requires to deliver value
   to your readership.

   Instead of getting labeled as a plugin hoarder like me, thoroughly
   assess your desire every time you get the itch to install a new plugin.
   Believe me, it’ll save you a ton of space and your blog won’t slow
   down.

Some Essential Plugins

   Having said all of that, there are some plugins that you should install
   without question.
     * A contact form plugin — Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms both work
       great.
     * A caching plugin — I’d recommend W3 Total Cache; it’s blazing fast!
     * An SEO plugin — Yoast SEO is hands down the best SEO plugin. There
       really is no competition.
     * Kiwi Social Sharing WordPress Plugin — Kiwi gives you tons of
       options and it’s super easy to use.
     * The Jetpack plugin — you can activate / deactivate its modules as
       per your requirement.

   Without a doubt, these plugins are essential to running a successful
   blog and you can install most of them free of charge. Fore more useful
   pluguins you can read our essential WordPress plugin guide.

30 Top Websites & Blogs That Are Powered By WordPress

   WordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems,
   especially for the non-tech savvy. I’ve boasted on several occasions
   that you can create WordPress sites and handle a reasonably high amount
   of traffic. Apart from its remarkable user friendliness, you can use
   WordPress for a multitude of purposes.

   Now it is time to test that boast. I’m going to list a few of the
   world’s most visited websites which run on WordPress.

   Please note, some of these websites may not rank as highly as you might
   expect on Alexa. If that is the case for any particular website here,
   it happens to cover a niche that isn’t as popular or there aren’t any
   better WordPress websites in the particular niche.

   The reasoning or the motivation behind this post is to not only
   demonstrate the power of WordPress in terms of ability to create
   high/medium traffic sites, but also to demonstrate WordPress’s
   usability across a wide spectrum of possible purposes and to show how
   organizations, corporations, small businesses, non profits, pop stars
   and athletes use WordPress for their on-line platforms.

   In no particular order, here are some awesome websites which run on
   WordPress.

Quartz

   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog
   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog

   An awesome news outlet born in 2012 to deliver business news across the
   world and cover every aspect of the new global economy. This website
   was created and designed to meet the needs of the modern web, where
   people reading the news are constantly on the move. Thus, it naturally
   looks great on tablets and mobile phones.

   Quartz is an excellent source of credible information with a great
   emphasis on digital storytelling as opposed to how traditional news
   sources operate. The website itself was designed so as to bring the
   benefits of the web and deliver it with the elegance of an application.

   The website is minimal, as are the menus; there is little to no
   distraction and the website enhances readability. A single full-screen
   image dominates individual posts. These posts provide an initial
   perspective and a glimpse into the topic of the post. But what follows
   after it is great content with well chosen typography and few images.

   The website also seems to operate on an infinite scroll, which is great
   for reading continually. It reduces the burden on menus for navigation
   of the site.

The New Yorker

   the-new-yorker-website the-new-yorker-website

   A weekly magazine which provides a melange of news on international
   affairs, popular culture, arts, business, science, technology and
   politics. And to top it off, they also report on poetry, humor and
   cartoons. Again, the theme here seems to be the same; the website can
   easily be viewed on mobile devices. The magazine is available for
   mobile readers via an app, which can be found in the App Store, on
   Amazon, and Google Play.

   A traditional magazine relies on subscriptions for revenue, as does The
   New Yorker. They have digital, print and a combination plan, which
   helps them generate revenue. The digital plan is a lot better option
   than the print edition. That is because you’ll have access to their
   complete digital archives which goes all the way back to 1925.
   Subscribers can access content based on their membership. Basically,
   you can login to access premium content from anywhere in the world.

   The website’s menu is a whole lot larger than Quartz, as you might
   imagine given the breadth of topics that it covers. The website is
   dotted with imagery of all sizes, and yet there is a lot of white space
   on the site. The publishing mechanism that WordPress provides makes it
   possible for creative writers and artists to publish content via normal
   written content, podcasts, videos, slideshows and interactive graphics
   easily.

BBC America

   bbc-america-wordpress-site bbc-america-wordpress-site

   BBC America brings the best of entertainment, including natural
   history, movies, sci-fi and drama. Ever heard of Doctor Who,
   Broadchurch, Man versus Wild or Orphan Black? Well, BBC America brought
   to you those shows.

   A lot of the content on the website is primarily about TV shows of
   different genres. In addition, great depth provides scheduling
   information; there’s a lot of video content in the form of teasers, and
   plenty of blog content about the TV shows and the entertainment
   business.

   There is also a shopping tab among the menu options. It permits the
   purchase of TV series like Top Gear and Sherlock. Although, I must
   point out that this leads to a BBC sister site, which does not run on
   WordPress.

   In all likelihood, the followers of TV series use the website more as
   reference to keep track of the timings of their favorite shows and
   their release dates. And the website’s scheduling information structure
   might support that claim; it is well built and intuitive to handle. In
   fact, the schedule page of BBC America seems to be running on Thematic,
   which is a free WordPress theme.

   This website is genuinely multifaceted, and delivers a multitude of
   content types. A lot of the content also seems to link back to the
   mother site of BBC, which creates a traffic loop. There is a menu atop
   the website with a wide spectrum of topics, which links back to BBC’s
   primary news website.

Time Inc.

   timeinc-website timeinc-website

   Time Inc., one of the most well known brands in the world. Let me put
   this into perspective: nearly 50% of the population of the United
   States will engage with a Time Inc. brand in a month. And they run
   their website on WordPress. Although, some of their brands may have
   other content management systems working in tandem with WordPress, or
   may run on a non-WordPress platform.

   That being said, it should take anything away from the fact that
   WordPress is incredibly versatile and can be used by a corporation that
   controls such a sizable portion of the media we consume. The website is
   largely descriptive of the Time brand and the brands they have in their
   diverse portfolio.

   You’ll find on the site what you might expect from any reasonably sized
   company. There is a great deal of information about their leadership,
   company profile, history, corporate social responsibility, investment
   information and career opportunities. They even report their quarterly
   earnings in the first page, as you might expect from any corporation
   whose primary motive is to make money for the shareholders.

   But in comparison to most corporate websites, this one is not in the
   least bit dry or boring. As you can see above, the imagery is excellent
   and greatly distracts us from the fact that it is a website of a pretty
   big corporate entity.

Time.com

   time-news-magazine-website time-news-magazine-website

   A brand owned by Time Inc.,Time magazine is one of the most widely
   recognized and read magazines in the world. A readership of around 25
   million strong and as of 2012, the eleventh most circulated magazine in
   the United States.

   The website is what you might expect from a news outlet, the site
   design is based on a side menu. The website uses a lot of red
   especially in the navigation options and unlike previous websites,
   there is little empty white space. The emphasis is far more on
   delivering news content as quickly as possible, there are also articles
   with great insightful depth in the magazine. Although, when you compare
   the website to Quartz, there is definitely less of an emphasis on
   readability.

   They publish on pretty much every topic you can imagine and the landing
   page has a lot of content on it. Images the site uses, some large and
   some thumbnails accompany the various articles on the site.

   As you can imagine such a website probably has a great number of
   authors and full time staff. It must certainly help to have WordPress,
   when publishing so much content produced by a number of authors and
   then checked by multiple editors. They also work on a subscription
   model for premium content.

TechCrunch

   techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog

   TechCrunch covers breaking news about the technology sector; they write
   about startups and a plethora of Internet products. Micheal Arrington
   starts this website to share information about new companies that were
   changing technology.

   The website menu is relatively simple, and the content itself, which is
   largely text, some images & video, is presented in a grid-like format
   working in tandem with a timeline system. Said grid displays posts
   according to publish time. Since the emphasis lies in creating content
   about breakthroughs before anyone else, the timeline format is ideal
   for presenting content.

   There’s also a purely video-based section on the site, which is
   dedicated to delivering new tech, interviews with tech industry experts
   & innovators and product reviews. TechCrunch is also well-known for its
   startup battlefield, which is dedicated to information on startups and
   their funding.

IFC

   ifc-entertainment-site ifc-entertainment-site

   IFC is a website dedicated to the entertainment industry with a focus
   on drama and comedy. It holds a lot of scheduling information which are
   easily accessible for visitors. The site also hosts information on
   movies, two blogs and some video content. IFC is unlike most websites
   where more white space is preferred; the site’s background is black,
   and the typography is bold and black, against a light blue background.

007

   007-james-bond-wordpress-site 007-james-bond-wordpress-site

   One of the most stylish, suave characters to have ever existed, James
   Bond is not just a spy; the character has been a lot more, and
   represents a regal elegance which you might only associate with the
   choicest of brands. So creating a website for the famous 007 character
   requires an equal amount of sophistication in design.

   The site’s design is, as you might expect, regal, to say the least.
   There are three colors involved here: one’s the site’s background, the
   text’s background, and the text itself. There is a lot of white space,
   while the white text is placed against a black background.

   The website is modeled on a portfolio or grid with the images making up
   for what some might consider a lack of color, given the abundance of
   black and white. But the use of only black and white primarily is
   probably what makes this site look great.

   If one were ever concerned whether a WordPress website can be designed
   for luxury brands, then this website is a great example of how awesome
   a WordPress site can be when it falls on the hands of the right
   developer.

Thrive Magazine

   thrive-dark-themed-website thrive-dark-themed-website

   A magazine that reports on sports, fitness, entrepreneurship and
   nutrition. Thrive employs a dark background set against big, white
   text, and a simple primary menu to navigate the website. The site does
   not particularly rank highly, but it does boast a very simple and
   straightforward design.

   I’ve seen many websites use minimal designs with white backgrounds.
   Here’s a rather minimal website that uses a dark background. Besides, a
   website that covers fitness is a good addition to this collection.

Van Heusen

   vanheusen-fashion-website vanheusen-fashion-website

   Yet another brand that is associated with style and regal
   professionalism, very similar to the 007 brand. The website contains a
   ton of information on their various products, loads of images of their
   catalog, and a few videos advertising the inventiveness of their
   clothing line.

The Next Web

   thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog

   If you are like me, you’ve probably followed The Next Web religiously.
   The site covers pretty much anything that comes out of the Internet and
   technology. There is a lot of content about how technology interacts
   with the world as we know it. They discuss money, insights into the
   tech world, and a whole lot of other cool stuff.

   The website is what you might expect from a typical tech website: a lot
   of images with the articles displayed in a grid. The primary menu is
   sticky and always stays on the screen. This is a nice touch for a
   website that generates an enormous amount of content on a daily basis.

Fortune Magazine

   fortune-business-news-magazine fortune-business-news-magazine

   Fortune is yet another well-known magazine from Time, Inc. The website
   is rather crowded with content, and there is lot less space for each
   single article or post on the homepage. This is normal on websites
   where the rate of content generation is very high and there are a great
   number of news stories worth reporting on in a small duration of time.

   A very purposeful website created to bring breaking news and insightful
   articles from the world of business.

ProBlogger

   problogger-website problogger-website

   One of my favorite websites, an absolutely great read for any freelance
   writer or Internet marketer. The website has a blog, podcast content,
   ebooks and an incredibly popular job board.

   You may not think much of the site’s design, but you’ll be amazed at
   how successful the website has been when it comes to connecting with
   audiences and attracting the right type of visitors. This is a fairly
   straightforward approach when creating what is essentially a blog that
   offers professional advice, tutorials and tips. The simplicity probably
   has a great deal to do with their success.

StartUp Weekend

   startup-weekend-by-google startup-weekend-by-google

   A well-designed website as you might expect, the menu is rather quirky
   in the form of cloud bubbles. The website is a little more than a
   landing page with some extra content regarding the event details of
   startup meets. But as far as its function which revolves around event
   management is concerned, the website is more than adequate and performs
   the job quite well.

Smithsonian National Museum Of African Art

   africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site

   You can find all sorts of content on this website, including a ton of
   amazing images and information about events and educational programs.
   While the website might not fall into the category of being a corporate
   website, it certainly has a regal definition tempered by flair and
   style that you might find in a website that covers popular social
   culture.

   I certainly wouldn’t have imagined a website for a museum using
   WordPress. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon the
   existence of this particular website.

Beyonce

   beyonce-wordpress-site beyonce-wordpress-site

   Yet another social and cultural icon of our times, a website completely
   dedicated to the artist Beyonce. The website has a lot of work from her
   photography catalogs. Furthermore, big bold large images cover the
   landing page of the site. Also, the side menu is rather large when
   invoked. Overall, it is a pretty awesome site for a great artist.

Usain Bolt

   usain-bolt-wordpress-website usain-bolt-wordpress-website

   If you were ever asked to pick an athlete whose performance is beyond
   comparison in his or her field, Bolt would certainly be among the
   contenders. The Jamaican sprinter’s website is dedicated to his
   athletic achievements and contains a lot of images. It boasts a full
   screen slider followed by a news stream, reporting his most recent
   sporting feats and his other adventures.

Invisible Children

   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website
   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website

   Invisible Children is a great website albeit about a sad topic. The
   website is the front for an NGO that fights for the rights of children
   who have been entrenched in the LRA and abducted for the purpose of
   serving as child soldiers.

   The website itself is brilliant in terms of its user interface and has
   the right functionality to help combat and save as many children as
   possible.

AMC

   amc-movie-wordpress-site amc-movie-wordpress-site

   The website for AMC, the makers of “The Walking Dead” and many other
   incredibly popular shows. AMC has a lot of powerful, full screen
   imagery intended to capture the curiosity and attention of prospective
   audiences to their TV shows. They also have a schedule information
   section, a blog and a shopping section.

Google Ventures

   google-ventures-wordpress-website google-ventures-wordpress-website

   Minimalism at its best. The menu structure and icons it employ for
   navigation are great; there is very little in the way of distraction on
   their pages. Google Ventures primarily tells the story of how they’ve
   helped startups grow and scale. Their website also provides extensive
   information on the startups they’ve funded.

The Rolling Stones

   rollingstones-band-website rollingstones-band-website

   One of the most well-known bands and/or brands in the music industry
   for more than half century, their website uses WordPress. The website
   has a lot of pink against a blue background and lots of videos, given
   the nature of the content you might expect. That is true at least on
   the landing page. But, if you explore the website a bit more, you’ll
   also find a lot of text content equally and well presented.

Outbrain

   outbrain-business-website outbrain-business-website

   A professional content discovery service that makes more than 200
   billion recommendations on a daily basis. The well-desinged website has
   a few full-screen images and uses the color orange very effectively
   indeed. There is very little text on the homepage and a menu that is as
   small as can be. The site is also incredibly easy to navigate.

Wired

   wired-business-news-website wired-business-news-website

   Wired is a magazine that brings you tomorrow’s technologies today.
   Their main website has a lot of content and a pretty large menu with a
   ton of options to choose from. It also uses a partial grid system in
   conjunction with side bars displaying a content stream of new
   information, as new ones are generated on the website.

   We’ve seen so many websites ranging from corporations, small online
   businesses to non profit organizations and magazines leveraging
   WordPress as a means to publish content on the Internet. But WordPress
   is also used as a blog, and it is an awesome platform for your average
   blog.

   But hold on, it isn’t just the average blog that uses WordPress. There
   are a great number of websites that use WordPress to run their blogs.
   Let’s have a look at a few of the best!

Sony

   sony-official-news-blog sony-official-news-blog

   A very large corporate brand in the electronics and gaming industry
   renown for its gaming consoles and smart phones. Their official blog
   runs on the WordPress platform; there is not much in the way of style
   in the website. The site has been designed to add a lot of text content
   about their products and various product specifications. There is a
   humongous archive with a lot of information on their various products
   stretching back to 2007.

Play Station Blog

   playstation-games-news-site playstation-games-news-site

   The website is pretty awesome with a portfolio/grid approach to video
   and image rich content. They’ve packed in a lot of images into a very
   small space at the top of the site. Moreover, as you scroll down, the
   site is divided into two columns, with large video content bearing
   individual posts.

TED Blog

   ted-simple-wordpress-blog ted-simple-wordpress-blog

   TED is another non-profit organization that leverages the power of
   WordPress to communicate ideas via the web. The website employs a menu
   with not too many options, followed by a full-screen article post and a
   two-column grid with more recently published articles. They also have
   quite an extensive footer. It directs you to the various TED programs
   and communication channels for interacting with TED.

Rackspace

   rackspace-cloud-platform-website rackspace-cloud-platform-website

   Rackspace is a WordPress blog, and is one of the leadings provider of
   raw computing infrastructure. A simple blog with with the posts divided
   into featured and latest posts. Obviously, as the blog of a service
   provider, there are a lot of link-backs to their services and their
   mother site.

Official LinkedIn Blog

   linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog

   Yes, the most used professional social network’s blog runs on
   WordPress. The website is designed for one purpose, and that is made
   abundantly clear from the onset. Most of the content on the blog
   focuses on human resources, talent management and hiring practices
   across the globe.

SAP News Center

   sap-news-center sap-news-center

   SAP is a multinational corporation that creates software for enterprise
   resource planning among others. Their blog delivers news from their
   various undertakings from all their divisions in different countries.

Facebook Newsroom

   facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme

   The world’s most popular social network’s official blog runs on
   WordPress. The site is minimal and has one large image/video on a
   slider system . It is then followed by simple plain text news with no
   thumbnails. Fairly simple site but remarkably readable as you might
   expect.

Final Thoughts

   I hope I’ve amply demonstrated how WordPress can be used and how wide a
   spectrum of purposes/businesses/niches WordPress can handle. It is very
   unlikely that the site you want to create can not be best achieved with
   WordPress as the Content Management System.

   If you are yet to create your first website or blog what are you
   waiting for – you have a wealth of knowledge available here on Colorlib
   and across the web to help you do just that.

       Hi Thanks for your tips.
       I agree that if you want to increase traffic to your site or wish
       the targeted audience grew, there are plenty of steps that you, a
       blogger, can follow in order to improve your website traffic and
       audience.
       The first step would be to write a blog every day. (Make it a
       habit!)
       Then, you could use a website tracking tool such as Google
       Analytics to monitor activity on your blog – web visitors, clicks,
       and conversions, etc.
       Next, you could use social media to drive traffic to your site.
       Fourth, include effective call to action to increase repeat
       visitors.
       Lastly, if you know the basics of on-page SEO and off-page SEO as
       well, then you should see significant number of traffic to your
       site!

       helps to build the big brands on the internet. Before reading this
       article I’m not aware of using WordPress CMS for big enterprises.

            Rachel,
            WordPress is not longer used just to create a simple WordPress
            blogs. It is used by millions of websites and many of theme
            are highly trafficked ones.

       I didn’t expect some of the sites on this list to be running
       WordPress lol. Especially AMC, LinkedIn and Playstation to name a
       few! Shows you just how powerful WordPress is at the present. I
       actually use WordPress for my personal blogs, I used Blogger a
       while back but switched to WordPress since it was a lot easier to
       use.

            They are using a WordPress just like we are and we aren’t
            paying for it nor receiving any money that we use it. So I see
            no reason why The Rolling Stones should be treated
            differently.

             30 Top Websites & Blogs That Are Powered By WordPress

   Vishnu

   4 months ago

   WordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems,
   especially for the non-tech savvy. I’ve boasted on several occasions
   that you can create WordPress sites and handle a reasonably high amount
   of traffic. Apart from its remarkable user friendliness, you can use
   WordPress for a multitude of purposes.

   Now it is time to test that boast. I’m going to list a few of the
   world’s most visited websites which run on WordPress.

   Please note, some of these websites may not rank as highly as you might
   expect on Alexa. If that is the case for any particular website here,
   it happens to cover a niche that isn’t as popular or there aren’t any
   better WordPress websites in the particular niche.

   The reasoning or the motivation behind this post is to not only
   demonstrate the power of WordPress in terms of ability to create
   high/medium traffic sites, but also to demonstrate WordPress’s
   usability across a wide spectrum of possible purposes and to show how
   organizations, corporations, small businesses, non profits, pop stars
   and athletes use WordPress for their on-line platforms.

   In no particular order, here are some awesome websites which run on
   WordPress.

Quartz

   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog

   An awesome news outlet born in 2012 to deliver business news across the
   world and cover every aspect of the new global economy. This website
   was created and designed to meet the needs of the modern web, where
   people reading the news are constantly on the move. Thus, it naturally
   looks great on tablets and mobile phones.

   Quartz is an excellent source of credible information with a great
   emphasis on digital storytelling as opposed to how traditional news
   sources operate. The website itself was designed so as to bring the
   benefits of the web and deliver it with the elegance of an application.

   The website is minimal, as are the menus; there is little to no
   distraction and the website enhances readability. A single full-screen
   image dominates individual posts. These posts provide an initial
   perspective and a glimpse into the topic of the post. But what follows
   after it is great content with well chosen typography and few images.

   The website also seems to operate on an infinite scroll, which is great
   for reading continually. It reduces the burden on menus for navigation
   of the site.

The New Yorker

   the-new-yorker-website

   A weekly magazine which provides a melange of news on international
   affairs, popular culture, arts, business, science, technology and
   politics. And to top it off, they also report on poetry, humor and
   cartoons. Again, the theme here seems to be the same; the website can
   easily be viewed on mobile devices. The magazine is available for
   mobile readers via an app, which can be found in the App Store, on
   Amazon, and Google Play.

   A traditional magazine relies on subscriptions for revenue, as does The
   New Yorker. They have digital, print and a combination plan, which
   helps them generate revenue. The digital plan is a lot better option
   than the print edition. That is because you’ll have access to their
   complete digital archives which goes all the way back to 1925.
   Subscribers can access content based on their membership. Basically,
   you can login to access premium content from anywhere in the world.

   The website’s menu is a whole lot larger than Quartz, as you might
   imagine given the breadth of topics that it covers. The website is
   dotted with imagery of all sizes, and yet there is a lot of white space
   on the site. The publishing mechanism that WordPress provides makes it
   possible for creative writers and artists to publish content via normal
   written content, podcasts, videos, slideshows and interactive graphics
   easily.

BBC America

   bbc-america-wordpress-site

   BBC America brings the best of entertainment, including natural
   history, movies, sci-fi and drama. Ever heard of Doctor Who,
   Broadchurch, Man versus Wild or Orphan Black? Well, BBC America brought
   to you those shows.

   A lot of the content on the website is primarily about TV shows of
   different genres. In addition, great depth provides scheduling
   information; there’s a lot of video content in the form of teasers, and
   plenty of blog content about the TV shows and the entertainment
   business.

   There is also a shopping tab among the menu options. It permits the
   purchase of TV series like Top Gear and Sherlock. Although, I must
   point out that this leads to a BBC sister site, which does not run on
   WordPress.

   In all likelihood, the followers of TV series use the website more as
   reference to keep track of the timings of their favorite shows and
   their release dates. And the website’s scheduling information structure
   might support that claim; it is well built and intuitive to handle. In
   fact, the schedule page of BBC America seems to be running on Thematic,
   which is a free WordPress theme.

   This website is genuinely multifaceted, and delivers a multitude of
   content types. A lot of the content also seems to link back to the
   mother site of BBC, which creates a traffic loop. There is a menu atop
   the website with a wide spectrum of topics, which links back to BBC’s
   primary news website.

Time Inc.

   timeinc-website

   Time Inc., one of the most well known brands in the world. Let me put
   this into perspective: nearly 50% of the population of the United
   States will engage with a Time Inc. brand in a month. And they run
   their website on WordPress. Although, some of their brands may have
   other content management systems working in tandem with WordPress, or
   may run on a non-WordPress platform.

   That being said, it should take anything away from the fact that
   WordPress is incredibly versatile and can be used by a corporation that
   controls such a sizable portion of the media we consume. The website is
   largely descriptive of the Time brand and the brands they have in their
   diverse portfolio.

   You’ll find on the site what you might expect from any reasonably sized
   company. There is a great deal of information about their leadership,
   company profile, history, corporate social responsibility, investment
   information and career opportunities. They even report their quarterly
   earnings in the first page, as you might expect from any corporation
   whose primary motive is to make money for the shareholders.

   But in comparison to most corporate websites, this one is not in the
   least bit dry or boring. As you can see above, the imagery is excellent
   and greatly distracts us from the fact that it is a website of a pretty
   big corporate entity.

Time.com

   time-news-magazine-website

   A brand owned by Time Inc.,Time magazine is one of the most widely
   recognized and read magazines in the world. A readership of around 25
   million strong and as of 2012, the eleventh most circulated magazine in
   the United States.

   The website is what you might expect from a news outlet, the site
   design is based on a side menu. The website uses a lot of red
   especially in the navigation options and unlike previous websites,
   there is little empty white space. The emphasis is far more on
   delivering news content as quickly as possible, there are also articles
   with great insightful depth in the magazine. Although, when you compare
   the website to Quartz, there is definitely less of an emphasis on
   readability.

   They publish on pretty much every topic you can imagine and the landing
   page has a lot of content on it. Images the site uses, some large and
   some thumbnails accompany the various articles on the site.

   As you can imagine such a website probably has a great number of
   authors and full time staff. It must certainly help to have WordPress,
   when publishing so much content produced by a number of authors and
   then checked by multiple editors. They also work on a subscription
   model for premium content.

TechCrunch

   techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog

   TechCrunch covers breaking news about the technology sector; they write
   about startups and a plethora of Internet products. Micheal Arrington
   starts this website to share information about new companies that were
   changing technology.

   The website menu is relatively simple, and the content itself, which is
   largely text, some images & video, is presented in a grid-like format
   working in tandem with a timeline system. Said grid displays posts
   according to publish time. Since the emphasis lies in creating content
   about breakthroughs before anyone else, the timeline format is ideal
   for presenting content.

   There’s also a purely video-based section on the site, which is
   dedicated to delivering new tech, interviews with tech industry experts
   & innovators and product reviews. TechCrunch is also well-known for its
   startup battlefield, which is dedicated to information on startups and
   their funding.

IFC

   ifc-entertainment-site

   IFC is a website dedicated to the entertainment industry with a focus
   on drama and comedy. It holds a lot of scheduling information which are
   easily accessible for visitors. The site also hosts information on
   movies, two blogs and some video content. IFC is unlike most websites
   where more white space is preferred; the site’s background is black,
   and the typography is bold and black, against a light blue background.

007

   007-james-bond-wordpress-site

   One of the most stylish, suave characters to have ever existed, James
   Bond is not just a spy; the character has been a lot more, and
   represents a regal elegance which you might only associate with the
   choicest of brands. So creating a website for the famous 007 character
   requires an equal amount of sophistication in design.

   The site’s design is, as you might expect, regal, to say the least.
   There are three colors involved here: one’s the site’s background, the
   text’s background, and the text itself. There is a lot of white space,
   while the white text is placed against a black background.

   The website is modeled on a portfolio or grid with the images making up
   for what some might consider a lack of color, given the abundance of
   black and white. But the use of only black and white primarily is
   probably what makes this site look great.

   If one were ever concerned whether a WordPress website can be designed
   for luxury brands, then this website is a great example of how awesome
   a WordPress site can be when it falls on the hands of the right
   developer.

Thrive Magazine

   thrive-dark-themed-website

   A magazine that reports on sports, fitness, entrepreneurship and
   nutrition. Thrive employs a dark background set against big, white
   text, and a simple primary menu to navigate the website. The site does
   not particularly rank highly, but it does boast a very simple and
   straightforward design.

   I’ve seen many websites use minimal designs with white backgrounds.
   Here’s a rather minimal website that uses a dark background. Besides, a
   website that covers fitness is a good addition to this collection.

Van Heusen

   vanheusen-fashion-website

   Yet another brand that is associated with style and regal
   professionalism, very similar to the 007 brand. The website contains a
   ton of information on their various products, loads of images of their
   catalog, and a few videos advertising the inventiveness of their
   clothing line.

The Next Web

   thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog

   If you are like me, you’ve probably followed The Next Web religiously.
   The site covers pretty much anything that comes out of the Internet and
   technology. There is a lot of content about how technology interacts
   with the world as we know it. They discuss money, insights into the
   tech world, and a whole lot of other cool stuff.

   The website is what you might expect from a typical tech website: a lot
   of images with the articles displayed in a grid. The primary menu is
   sticky and always stays on the screen. This is a nice touch for a
   website that generates an enormous amount of content on a daily basis.

Fortune Magazine

   fortune-business-news-magazine

   Fortune is yet another well-known magazine from Time, Inc. The website
   is rather crowded with content, and there is lot less space for each
   single article or post on the homepage. This is normal on websites
   where the rate of content generation is very high and there are a great
   number of news stories worth reporting on in a small duration of time.

   A very purposeful website created to bring breaking news and insightful
   articles from the world of business.

ProBlogger

   problogger-website

   One of my favorite websites, an absolutely great read for any freelance
   writer or Internet marketer. The website has a blog, podcast content,
   ebooks and an incredibly popular job board.

   You may not think much of the site’s design, but you’ll be amazed at
   how successful the website has been when it comes to connecting with
   audiences and attracting the right type of visitors. This is a fairly
   straightforward approach when creating what is essentially a blog that
   offers professional advice, tutorials and tips. The simplicity probably
   has a great deal to do with their success.

StartUp Weekend

   startup-weekend-by-google

   A well-designed website as you might expect, the menu is rather quirky
   in the form of cloud bubbles. The website is a little more than a
   landing page with some extra content regarding the event details of
   startup meets. But as far as its function which revolves around event
   management is concerned, the website is more than adequate and performs
   the job quite well.

Smithsonian National Museum Of African Art

   africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site

   You can find all sorts of content on this website, including a ton of
   amazing images and information about events and educational programs.
   While the website might not fall into the category of being a corporate
   website, it certainly has a regal definition tempered by flair and
   style that you might find in a website that covers popular social
   culture.

   I certainly wouldn’t have imagined a website for a museum using
   WordPress. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon the
   existence of this particular website.

Beyonce

   beyonce-wordpress-site

   Yet another social and cultural icon of our times, a website completely
   dedicated to the artist Beyonce. The website has a lot of work from her
   photography catalogs. Furthermore, big bold large images cover the
   landing page of the site. Also, the side menu is rather large when
   invoked. Overall, it is a pretty awesome site for a great artist.

Usain Bolt

   usain-bolt-wordpress-website

   If you were ever asked to pick an athlete whose performance is beyond
   comparison in his or her field, Bolt would certainly be among the
   contenders. The Jamaican sprinter’s website is dedicated to his
   athletic achievements and contains a lot of images. It boasts a full
   screen slider followed by a news stream, reporting his most recent
   sporting feats and his other adventures.

Invisible Children

   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website

   Invisible Children is a great website albeit about a sad topic. The
   website is the front for an NGO that fights for the rights of children
   who have been entrenched in the LRA and abducted for the purpose of
   serving as child soldiers.

   The website itself is brilliant in terms of its user interface and has
   the right functionality to help combat and save as many children as
   possible.

AMC

   amc-movie-wordpress-site

   The website for AMC, the makers of “The Walking Dead” and many other
   incredibly popular shows. AMC has a lot of powerful, full screen
   imagery intended to capture the curiosity and attention of prospective
   audiences to their TV shows. They also have a schedule information
   section, a blog and a shopping section.

Google Ventures

   google-ventures-wordpress-website

   Minimalism at its best. The menu structure and icons it employ for
   navigation are great; there is very little in the way of distraction on
   their pages. Google Ventures primarily tells the story of how they’ve
   helped startups grow and scale. Their website also provides extensive
   information on the startups they’ve funded.

The Rolling Stones

   rollingstones-band-website

   One of the most well-known bands and/or brands in the music industry
   for more than half century, their website uses WordPress. The website
   has a lot of pink against a blue background and lots of videos, given
   the nature of the content you might expect. That is true at least on
   the landing page. But, if you explore the website a bit more, you’ll
   also find a lot of text content equally and well presented.

Outbrain

   outbrain-business-website

   A professional content discovery service that makes more than 200
   billion recommendations on a daily basis. The well-desinged website has
   a few full-screen images and uses the color orange very effectively
   indeed. There is very little text on the homepage and a menu that is as
   small as can be. The site is also incredibly easy to navigate.

Wired

   wired-business-news-website

   Wired is a magazine that brings you tomorrow’s technologies today.
   Their main website has a lot of content and a pretty large menu with a
   ton of options to choose from. It also uses a partial grid system in
   conjunction with side bars displaying a content stream of new
   information, as new ones are generated on the website.

   We’ve seen so many websites ranging from corporations, small online
   businesses to non profit organizations and magazines leveraging
   WordPress as a means to publish content on the Internet. But WordPress
   is also used as a blog, and it is an awesome platform for your average
   blog.

   But hold on, it isn’t just the average blog that uses WordPress. There
   are a great number of websites that use WordPress to run their blogs.
   Let’s have a look at a few of the best!

Sony

   sony-official-news-blog

   A very large corporate brand in the electronics and gaming industry
   renown for its gaming consoles and smart phones. Their official blog
   runs on the WordPress platform; there is not much in the way of style
   in the website. The site has been designed to add a lot of text content
   about their products and various product specifications. There is a
   humongous archive with a lot of information on their various products
   stretching back to 2007.

Play Station Blog

   playstation-games-news-site

   The website is pretty awesome with a portfolio/grid approach to video
   and image rich content. They’ve packed in a lot of images into a very
   small space at the top of the site. Moreover, as you scroll down, the
   site is divided into two columns, with large video content bearing
   individual posts.

TED Blog

   ted-simple-wordpress-blog

   TED is another non-profit organization that leverages the power of
   WordPress to communicate ideas via the web. The website employs a menu
   with not too many options, followed by a full-screen article post and a
   two-column grid with more recently published articles. They also have
   quite an extensive footer. It directs you to the various TED programs
   and communication channels for interacting with TED.

Rackspace

   rackspace-cloud-platform-website

   Rackspace is a WordPress blog, and is one of the leadings provider of
   raw computing infrastructure. A simple blog with with the posts divided
   into featured and latest posts. Obviously, as the blog of a service
   provider, there are a lot of link-backs to their services and their
   mother site.

Official LinkedIn Blog

   linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog

   Yes, the most used professional social network’s blog runs on
   WordPress. The website is designed for one purpose, and that is made
   abundantly clear from the onset. Most of the content on the blog
   focuses on human resources, talent management and hiring practices
   across the globe.

SAP News Center

   sap-news-center

   SAP is a multinational corporation that creates software for enterprise
   resource planning among others. Their blog delivers news from their
   various undertakings from all their divisions in different countries.

Facebook Newsroom

   facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme

   The world’s most popular social network’s official blog runs on
   WordPress. The site is minimal and has one large image/video on a
   slider system . It is then followed by simple plain text news with no
   thumbnails. Fairly simple site but remarkably readable as you might
   expect.

Final Thoughts

   I hope I’ve amply demonstrated how WordPress can be used and how wide a
   spectrum of purposes/businesses/niches WordPress can handle. It is very
   unlikely that the site you want to create can not be best achieved with
   WordPress as the Content Management System.

   If you are yet to create your first website or blog what are you
   waiting for – you have a wealth of knowledge available here on Colorlib
   and across the web to help you do just that.

   But if you are a wee bit lazy like me, you can read an article I posted

   more on how to make your site secure and how you can increase your
   website’s performance.

How to Start a Blog From Scratch – A Comprehensive Guide

   Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past decade or so,
   you’ve probably noticed the sudden increase in blogging websites.

   Regardless of the nature of your business, setting up a web presence is
   more important than ever before. And once you’ve got your website in
   place, you’ll need a blog to go with it – after all, blogging is
   perhaps one of the most powerful tools you can leverage to boost sales,
   attract new customers and build brand credibility with existing
   clients.

   With all of this in mind, we’ve decided to put together a comprehensive
   yet simple-to-follow step by step guide to help you create your very
   own blog from scratch. In this article, you’ll find everything you need
   from purchasing a domain name to selecting a hosting provider and
   installing software to publishing your first blog post.

   Let’s get started building your first blog!

5 Steps to Start a Blog

   Let me start off by saying that you don’t need to be programming
   literate to follow this practical guide – in fact, you won’t have to
   write a single line of code. To those of you who shy away from the mere
   thought of coding (don’t worry; I’m no stranger in that community!) I
   say “Fear not, for this guide is with you.”

   I’ll walk you through five simple steps to help you launch your blog:
    1. Choose a Blogging Platform
    2. Choose Suitable Hosting
    3. Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting
    4. Customize Your Blog
    5. Add Useful Plugins

   Now that we’ve gotten all of the preliminary details out of the ways,
   let’s jump right into the tutorial. You’ll have it up and running in
   the next 15 minutes – I kid you not!
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 1

Choose a Blogging Platform

   The first thing you’ll have to do is select a content management system
   (CMS) that will serve as the underlying platform for your blog. Now
   you’ve probably heard of a few of the major blogging platforms out
   there – WordPress, Blogger, Joomla, Drupal, etc.

WordPress All The Way

   I’m a huge advocate of WordPress and I wholeheartedly recommend it to
   anyone who wants to start their own blog. Here are a few simple reasons
   why:
     * It’s massive. As of the writing of this article, WordPress powers
       nearly 74.6 million websites.
     * It’s absolutely free. WordPress was essentially designed to be an
       open source project.

     * It’s secure and reliable. The dedicated team of developers behind
       WordPress, Automattic, is always updating the CMS to ensure maximum
       safety. If it’s safe enough for NASA, chances are it’s safe enough
       for you.
     * It’s scalable. Whether you want to launch a personal blog or are in
       hopes of a much bigger, CNN-sized site (yes, CNN runs on WordPress,
       too!), you can rest assured that it’ll operate without any
       glitches.

   Those of you who are launching their first blog and probably don’t have
   a ton of potential traffic lined up are far better off opting for
   WordPress. Aside from the platform-specific benefits the CMS offers,
   it’ll save you a ton of time, effort, and money.

   Hosting with WordPress is low-cost and installation takes 5 minutes.
   The best part, however, is and will always be that you don’t need to be
   exceptionally skilled in a web programming language (or even know the
   ABC’s of it) to launch and operate a successful WordPress-based blog.

   If you’re convinced that WordPress really is the best CMS out there,
   let’s move on to the next section.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 2

Choose Suitable Hosting

   Now that you’ve made the right decision in choosing WordPress as your
   CMS, there’s just one more choice to make – choosing a type of hosting
   provider.

   The decision you make at this stage will have a colossal effect on the
   outcome of your blog. You can choose to fork out a couple of dollars
   every month for self-hosting or go for a free alternative instead. And
   although the latter sounds absolutely incredible, that’s not the
   direction you’ll want to head in.

Why You Should Avoid Free Blog Sites

   With free blogging platforms (non-hosted platforms) the disadvantages
   always outnumber the advantages. Always. For starters, you get a
   terrible domain name – something like
   ‘myblog.freebloggingplatform.com’. Your blog’s domain name has a
   significant impact on SEO and social media marketing so if you want
   your blog to really take off and be discoverable then you’ll want to go
   with a self-hosting.

   A .com extension is the standard norm and nearly 75% of all websites
   have it. I’m not saying it’s impossible to attract millions of unique
   monthly page views with a .freebloggingplatform.com extension but how
   many successful bloggers (or any successful site for that matter) do
   you know by that domain name extension?

     “Brand is the sum total of how someone perceives a particular
     organization.”

   You want a web address that rolls off the tongue easily. One that
   people will remember. One that tactfully illustrates your brand and
   communicates what your blog is all about in a concise yet relevant set
   of characters.

Disadvantages of Non-Hosted Blogging Platforms

     * URL Problem. Your blog’s URL will be long, unappealing, and
       unprofessional.
     * No Real Ownership. Since you’re not paying for hosting, your blog
       won’t actually be your blog – it’s hosted on someone else’s web
       property. This means that they can delete it whenever they want.
     * Other Restrictions. Free blogging platforms don’t let you do all
       the cool stuff like monetize your blog, use themes, or install
       plugins. Worst of all, your site’s space on the server is limited
       which means you can’t even upload all of the images and videos you
       were hoping would attract traffic.

   These are factors that most of us simply can’t afford to compromise on.
   They are essential to the timely success of our blog and we’re willing
   to spend a few bucks for it.

   Luckily enough for you, I’ve worked out the most optimal and
   cost-efficient solution after carefully analyzing the hosting industry.
   (It’s a difficult and confusing world to navigate through.) Long story
   short: Bluehost is the winner.

Why Bluehost Is Best

   Bluehost offers everything from shared hosting to optimized hosting for
   WordPress at a reasonable price. Being a first-time webmaster, it’s
   best to go for shared hosting. The rest of them are advanced hosting
   services and more suitable for bigger blogs. You won’t need the kind of
   functionality they offer right away and when you feel like you do, you
   can always upgrade to another hosting plan.

   Bluehost’s Shared Hosting plan is an ideal candidate for several
   reasons:
    1. WordPress users get a special discount price at $3.49/month.
    2. You’ll get a free domain name.
    3. 1-click WordPress install.
    4. 24/7 support.
    5. 30-day money back guarantee.

   It stands to reason that WordPress and Bluehost go hand in hand — the
   best CMS paired with an affordable and reliable hosting provider. In
   the next section, we’ll walk you through a simple procedure to set up
   your domain name and hosting service with Bluehost.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 3

Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting

   Click here to visit the Bluehost homepage to begin setting up your
   first blog. We'll receive a commission if you decided to purchase
   through these links.

   1. On the Bluehost homepage, you’ll find products in the menu bar.
   Hover over it and click on shared hosting.
   Bluehost's products menu.

   Select shared hosting from the products menu.

   2. You will be redirected to a page that gives you a brief overview of
   Bluehost’s shared hosting plan. Click on the green get started now
   button to proceed with the setup.
   Get started now button.

   Get started with shared hosting.

   3. Select your preferred shared hosting plan. We recommend you go with
   the basic plan for now.
   Bluehost's pricing table.

   Select the basic shared hosting plan.

   4. The next page prompts you to select a domain name and domain name
   extension for your blog — the fun (sometimes frustrating) part of the
   whole experience. Click next once you’re done.
   Domain name.

   Enter a domain name.

   5. Once you select a domain name that you like and is available, you’ll
   see a verification message on the next page notifying you that the
   domain is available and you can advance to the next step.

   6. On the same page, you’ll see an account information form that
   requires you to fill out your personal details.
   Bluehost form.

   Fill in your account information.

   7. Once you’ve filled out your account information details, you’ll be
   prompted to select/deselect options for your package in the package
   information form.
   Package information form.

   Tick all the features you’d like to opt for.

   Let’s quickly review the options you can select to enhance the
   functionality and security of your brand new blogging site:
     * Constant Contact. Constant Contact is one of the best tools to
       connect with your audience without hassle. It allows you to create,
       send, and track emails and newsletters to your readership. This
       isn’t mandatory, but if you think that you’ll be sending emails to
       your subscribers regularly then go for it!
     * Domain Privacy Protection. A domain name’s whois information is
       available for anyone to acquire on the Internet. Most of the time,
       marketing companies leverage this information and send a ton of
       unwanted solicitations your way. By selecting this option, the only
       visible information will be Bluehost thus preventing your whois
       information from being publicly available.
     * Site Backup Pro. This feature takes automatic backups of your blog
       regularly. I would strongly recommend that you leave this box
       ticked. Choosing to opt out would mean that you’d have to take
       manual backups using a plugin.
     * Search Engine Jumpstart. Since you’re just starting out with your

Step 4

Customize Your Blog

   In this section, I’ll introduce you to the WordPress Dashboard and help
   you install a theme to increase your blog’s visual appeal.

An Introduction to the WordPress Dashboard

   The WordPress Dashboard can be quite overwhelming for first-time users
   but I promise you’ll get used to it sooner than you think. For the
   purpose of this post, I’ll cover the following items:
     * Activating a Theme
     * Writing Your First Post
     * Exploring the Media Library
     * Adding a User

   Sounds good? Let’s get started.

Activating a Theme

   We’ll start out by installing and activating a WordPress theme to our
   blog. By default, WordPress has its default theme activated (Twenty
   Sixteen as of this writing). We’re going to change the default theme to
   a more sophisticated and contemporary theme designed specifically for
   blogging sites. Enter Activello.

   Activello is a simple, multipurpose blog theme for WordPress designed
   by our exceptionally talented team. It’s got all the right features to
   get you started with a professional and modern-looking blog. Best of
   all it’s free! You can download it from here.
   Install Activello theme

   Upload the theme’s .zip file and click Install Now.
    1. From your WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Appearance menu item
       and click on Themes in the sub-menu. (Appearance > Themes)
    2. Once you’re at the Themes window, click the Add New button at the
       top
    3. Click the Upload Theme button and upload the theme’s .zip file.
    4. Once it’s uploaded, click Install Now.
    5. You will be redirected to a screen that notifies you of the status
       of the installation. Click the Activate link once the theme is
       successfully installed.

   You can leave it be or tweak it if you’d like to change a design aspect
   by navigating to Appearance > Customize. If you’re thinking of setting
   up a niche-specific blog then be sure to check out our complete
   collection of WordPress themes.

Writing Your First Post

   As a blogger, you’ll be writing a ton of posts so it’s important that
   you pay attention to this section to get the basics down.
   Adding a post.

   Post-ception!
    1. Hover over the Posts menu item and click Add New. (Posts > Add New)
    2. You’ll be redirected to the Add New Post screen which looks
       something like this:
    3. Add a suitable title in the text box that says Enter title here.
    4. In the big text editor below, add your post’s content. You’ll find
       that there’s a handy dandy toolbar embedded inside to help you
       format your post.
    5. Click the Publish button once you’re done.

   Voila! The post is published to your blog and everyone can see it now.
   How easy was that?

Exploring the Media Library

   The WordPress Media Library is a powerful tool that you can leverage to
   handle practically all of your media management. It stores all media
   files (images, videos, audio, and documents) that you upload to your
   WordPress blog regardless of whether it’s published or not.
   WordPress Media Library.

   The powerful Media Library.
    1. Click the Media menu item from the WordPress Dashboard.
    2. You will be redirected to the Media Library screen from where you
       can manage all of your media files.
    3. Click the Add New button at the top of the screen.
    4. Select a media item from your drive and upload it.
    5. The media item will be added to your Media Library and you can
       embed it in posts and pages now.

   The Media Library also lets you edit images from within WordPress —
   cropping, resizing, scaling – you name it. A blog post isn’t complete
   without a few relevant images to go with it!

Adding a User

   Seeing that you’re a dedicated blogger and are in high hopes of taking
   your blogging site to better frontiers (after all, you have made it
   this far down the post), there will come a time when you’ll need some
   outside help or in other words, you’ll want to outsource some of your
   work.

   Whether it’s to manage the technical side of your website or to add a
   few regular authors to your team, the best way to go about it is to add
   user accounts. WordPress enables admins to add users to their site
   which allows them restricted access to the blog’s back end (depending
   upon the user’s role).
   Add New User form.

   Fill out the Add New User form and select a user role.
    1. On the WordPress Dashboard, hover over Users and click Add New.
       (Users > Add New)
    2. The Add New User screen will appear and you will be prompted to add
       some personal details of the user you intend to add.
    3. Once you’ve filled out the details, select a user role from the
       drop-down menu e.g. Admin, Author, Editor, etc.
    4. Click Add New User.

   Your new user will be added to your site and they’ll receive an
   automated email containing their login information.

Step 5

Add Useful Plugins

   Want to add a new feature to your blog? There’s a plugin for that!
   Plugins are ways to extend and add to the functionality that already
   exists in WordPress.

   Plugins can be thought of as tiny apps that enhance your blog’s
   functionality. WordPress has a ton of plugins, both free and premium,
   for you to select from. In fact, there’s a whole official WordPress
   Repository full of freebies that you should definitely check out.

How to Add Plugins

   Adding plugins to your WordPress blog is quite simple.
   Add New Plugin screen.

   Adding plugins to enhance functionality.
    1. Navigate to the WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Plugins menu
       item and click Add New. (Plugins > Add New)
    2. On the Add Plugins screen, you’ll find that you can upload plugins
       or search for free plugins using the search box located in the
       top-right corner of the screen.
    3. Once you’ve selected a plugin to install, click the Install Now
       button.
    4. Activate the plugin after it’s been installed.

   Installing plugins is quite unchallenging and after tinkering with
   their settings you can start using them immediately.

A Word to the Wise

   Take it from a plugin hoarder, it’s very easy to become addicted to
   installing and storing plugins to your blog site. I mean they’re so
   cool and there’s so many of them and they do so many cool things.

   One thing you need to remember is that you don’t have unlimited space
   on your server. Now 50 GB is more than enough to get your blog off the
   ground but it’s not enough for you to store hundreds of activated
   plugins on. I strongly suggest that you evaluate your blog’s needs and
   make a list of the most essential plugins it requires to deliver value
   to your readership.

   Instead of getting labeled as a plugin hoarder like me, thoroughly
   assess your desire every time you get the itch to install a new plugin.
   Believe me, it’ll save you a ton of space and your blog won’t slow
   down.

Some Essential Plugins

   Having said all of that, there are some plugins that you should install
   without question.
     * A contact form plugin — Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms both work
       great.
     * A caching plugin — I’d recommend W3 Total Cache; it’s blazing fast!
     * An SEO plugin — Yoast SEO is hands down the best SEO plugin. There
       really is no competition.
     * Kiwi Social Sharing WordPress Plugin — Kiwi gives you tons of
       options and it’s super easy to use.
     * The Jetpack plugin — you can activate / deactivate its modules as
       per your requirement.

   Without a doubt, these plugins are essential to running a successful
   blog and you can install most of them free of charge. Fore more useful
   pluguins you can read our essential WordPress plugin guide.

   Hopefully, we’ve provided you with enough information to get started
   with setting up your very own WordPress blog from scratch. We encourage
