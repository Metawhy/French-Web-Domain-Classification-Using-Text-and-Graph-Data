                                  Welcome!


    In centuries past baskets have been a necessity of life. Although the
    use of the basket in daily life has changed - the basic art of making
                          them has stayed the same.
       It is my pleasure to introduce you to my own handwoven collection

                                  DSCF3688
   All the baskets you will see here are handwoven by myself,using rattan
    reed. I also make my own stain , using pecan shells, to give them an
                              'antiqued' look.
       They are woven the 'old- fashioned' way, using no nails, glue, or
     staples (with the exception of some of the boughten handles).  This
                  makes a very strong, yet flexible basket.
         They are made to use! and I encourage you to do so! A damper
    environment is better for the baskets than too dry, so an occasional
              wash at the garden hose is a good thing for them.
    The baskets can easily be customized to a size or color you prefer. I
   do a lot of special order as well, so please let me know if I can help
                            you out in this way.
    I do offer a selection of color: black, dark brown, navy blue, cobalt
   blue, kelly green, dark green, scarlet red, and wine, for you to choose
                   for the colored weaving in the basket.
       Please enjoy browsing and don't forget to sign the guestbook as you
                                   leave!
                        BLESSINGS TO YOU!  - Emily -
