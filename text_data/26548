       Yowza! I’ve seen Metropolis a half-dozen times or so, NEVER on the
       big screen… terrific idea! This will be worth a little bit of a
       drive.

               Adam Volker @ View Conference – 24-28 Oct. 2016

   [view-1.png?resize=1200%2C360]

   Say howdy to Moonbot Interactive Creative Director Adam Volker at the
   17th annual View Conference, taking place October 24 – 28, 2016. The
   conference is Italy’s largest computer graphics and digital media
   conference, showcasing a cross-section of industry professionals in
   animation, visual effects, virtual reality and digital design.

   Adam has long been fascinated by the language used to describe the
   creative process of painting. He’s often wondered: what might the
   language of painting tell us about evaluating games? He’ll share his
   thoughts in his presentation:

A Painter’s Vocabulary For Games

     We reserve certain words to evaluate only parts of a piece of media.
     We use art words to talk exclusively about the art inside the thing.
     If we tried to use those words more globally, and talked about a
     piece of film or a game as a whole with those words, we might have
     more insight into the things we enjoy about it. In this talk, Adam
     will discuss different games alongside paintings in hopes that
     attendees get new tools to discuss and evaluate the media they
     consume.


   Here’s some of the other talks at View that Adam is looking forward to:
     * Siobhan Reddy – The Future of Games
     * Josh Holmes – The Power of Ambition
     * Roger Guyett – The Visual Effects of ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’
     * Barry Meade – Making ‘The Room’ & The Lost Business of Art


   Follow Adam on Tumblr or Twitter for updates on his presentation,
   sketches, game ideas and more!

                  The Boy Who Learned To Fly Reaches 4MM Views

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/6b03jWW70kc

   We’re honored to partner with Gatorade and TBWA\CHIAT\DAY on a new film
   collaboration, The Boy Who Learned To Fly, based on the life of Usain
   Bolt, which just reached 4 million views on YouTube.

   From humble beginnings in a Jamaican schoolyard to his ascendance on
   the world stage, sprinter Usain Bolt finds a way to fly past the
   pressure. In the 7-minute short film, he re-discovers the joys of
   running, by keeping it light and overcoming the weight of fame,
   fulfilling his destiny as the fastest man alive.

   During production, our team created three different versions of Usain
   Bolt for the film: a young wide-eyed kid, teen Usain and the incredible
   athlete he is today. We based these designs on images from his life and
   created each to demonstrate the inner struggles Usain Bolt experiences
   as the pressure of competing increases with each win.


   To capture the richness of the textures, colors and spirit of Jamaica,
   our team used a combination of 2D and 3D animation techniques so that
   we could use the best of both techniques: “We get what’s great CG
   camera to move through space; and, we get what’s great about a painting
   in being able to control texture and edge, ” said co-director Jake
   Wyatt in our behind-the-scenes video.
