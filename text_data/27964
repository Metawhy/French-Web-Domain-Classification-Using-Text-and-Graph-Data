The Key To Going All Natural

   Posted by fp brigette on February 26, 2014February 25, 2014 in beauty
   [Messy-braid-sheer-blue-top.jpg]

   A year or two ago, if you were to look at my beauty cabinet, you’d have
   probably been dumbfounded by the overwhelming amount of chemical-filled
   products in there. Lotions and cleansers and self tanners and hair
   serums and deep conditioners and astringents… I could go on forever.
   You see, I’ve always been a lover of beauty products — I still am — but
   I haven’t always been such a huge advocate for natural beauty.

   It just used to be something I never really thought about. I knew that
   what I was putting onto my skin and hair wasn’t necessarily good for
   me, but I kind of always assumed that I didn’t have any other option.

   Boy was I wrong. After becoming a part of this lovely blog, I began
   exploring the world of natural beauty, and slowly it rose to become one
   of my top priorities. I’m still learning — and as I do, I alter my
   beauty routine ever so slightly. It’s all about constant progression…
   which brings me to my main focus: making the switch to a natural beauty
   routine.

   Nature pieces and mascara

   Making the switch is something that every single person will do
   differently. Each one of us is unique. We have different bodies — and
   different wants & needs — so a product that works wonders on one of
   your friends may happen to not do anything for you. From my personal
   experience, though, what I can offer you is one main piece of knowledge
   I have acquired: The key to going natural is understanding that the
   process is going to take time.

   Take your time

   Of course you can switch to an all-natural routine in one day. You can
   throw out every non-natural product you own and replace with the finest
   ingredients… but I don’t feel that this is the way to do it. It’s
   similar to the idea of going on a crash diet in order to prep yourself
   for an upcoming event — it might work short term, but you’re likely to
   soon go back to past ways. If you want to truly make a change to your
   lifestyle, do it slowly, one step at a time. This way, your body can
   get used to each change one by one, you can slowly learn how your body
   reacts to different products — and alter them until you find what works
   best for you, and the change won’t be such a shock to you overall.

   Start by choosing one thing to switch — maybe you want to use natural
   oil to moisturize your skin instead of store-bought lotion. Try organic
   coconut oil for a bit. If you’re not into it after about a week, switch
   to vitamin E, and so forth, until you find what works for you. Once
   you’re comfortable with that, move on to switching out your perfume or
   your body wash. Step by step, little by little.

   Coconut oil, olive oil, Wild Unknown notecard

   Always make sure to research. You want to be sure that the products
   you’re using are truly ok to be putting on your body, and you want to
   get an understanding of why certain products are producing the results
   they’re producing. The best part about this is that if natural beauty
   is something that really interests you, all of this research won’t even
   feel like research. For me, I always enjoy looking up which natural
   ingredients can be used for what purpose on the body. After months upon
   months of perusing the internet for this kind of information (just a
   little at a time), I’ve come to recognize which ingredients are most
   beneficial for the body, as well as the different ways to use them.
   It’s fun!

   Once you get comfortable with your overall routine, you can start
   making tiny alterations to the products you’re using, tweaking
   ingredients here or there to get them to be exactly how you want.
   Suddenly you’ll find yourself concocting your own unique creations that
   are formulated just for you. Here are some general insights to help get
   you started on your natural journey!

   For cleansing: Castile soap is great when you need a cleanser. I love
   Dr. Bronners, which can be diluted and used as a shampoo or a body wash
   (and plenty of other things, too)!

   For exfoliating: Use a naturally abrasive substance like sugar or salt
   to create an exfoliating product like a lip or body scrub.

   Sugar, wooden spoon

   For moisturizing: Oils like coconut, avocado, jojoba, sweet almond,
   olive, and vitamin E are excellent moisturizers. Use them alone on skin
   or hair to smooth and hydrate, or as a base in homemade concoctions
   like body scrubs and hair masks.

   For scenting: Essential oils are a natural way to add a beautiful scent
   to your beauty products. Experiment with different mixtures to find a
   blend that suits you. Try rose & sandalwood, lavender & eucalyptus, or
   lemon & ginger.

   Open perfume bottle, dried plants, pebbles

   We’ve done lots and lots of blog posts on DIY beauty products and
   benefits of certain natural ingredients. Here are a list of some of my
   favorites that I think are really useful!

   and I love researching essential oils for health AND beauty remedies!
   The ways I’ve switched my beauty routine in the past year include:
   facial toner = one part water, one part apple cider vinegar, tea tree
   and lavender E.O. drops facial, lip and body scrub = two parts dark

   It’s just not for everyone. I tried many different oils on my skin,
   they all don’t seem to work. I have dry skin and sometimes
   neurodermatitis. When I use oils only (or mixed with water) my skin
   dries out in a very strange way. It doesn’t look dry but it feels
   horrible! When I get essential oils on my skin it burns like hell. I’m
   allergic to a lot of things therefore going natural for me is a
   desaster! I’m quite thankful that there are products provided by “the
   industry” that don’t cause me allergic reactions :/

   it’s hyped up to be! I use it with brown sugar and cinnamon to create a
   lovely smelling scrub in the shower and saves me the extra step of
   putting on moisturizer after I get out! Plus, It makes me feel as if

   a good thing to remember when trying to make the switch to natural
   beauty products is that everyone is different. if using straight oils
   on your skin makes you too greasy or feels weird, try buying a natural
   lotion (like Nature’s Gate or Dr. Bronner’s lotions) that include
   ingredients like coconut and vitamin e oil, but are already blended
   with other products so they’re not so intense. also, Tatjana –
   essential oils often need a carrier oil to be applied to skin. some
   oils like lavender aren’t very intense so most people can just apply
   them directly, but if you… Read more »

   Aloe vera works for me! I cut a leaf, clean it very well, employ the
   inside of the leaf in my face every night before bed and I wash it in
   the morning (use just a piece, the rest I keep in the fridge). It helps
   me to keep my face without blemishes. The only secret is be constant

   It actually what I did. Now I have a natural skincare routine. I wash
   my face with oatmeal then use rose toner to moisturize. After that I
   use aloe vera gel. It makes my skin feels so good. Sometimes I use oil.
   For face I’d love to use carrot seed oil to clear away the blemishes.
   For hair it would be honey, coconut oil and olive oil.

   I have heard that coconut oil clogs pores from some people, and that it
   doesn’t from others. Does it just depend on the person’s skin
   sensitivity? I have oilier, acne prone skin, and i have been using
   olive oil at night and I really like it, but i kinda want to try

   away the products that had parabens in it. I started switching my

   This is really interesting, I’m thinking of going natural, I’ve started
   with a few products already and I’m really loving it :D

   If your unsure on making your own you should try products from Lush or
   some of the sellers on etsy who make and sell all natural products. All
   the products from Lush are tailored for specific things and they smell
   great. The gorilla perfumes are great too! they can be a little pricey
   but can be worth it :)

   I love me some natural products but remember……you still are using
   chemical filled products. Everything is made up of chemicals even the
   most natural and simple products. Also natural does not automatically
   mean safer. Think of poison ivy, hemlock, arsenic, asbestos, lead,
   snake venom, mercury, etc….these are all perfectly natural substances
   but also pretty dangerous. And some synthetic substances are virtually
   non-toxic. So natural does not automatically mean safer and better and
   synthetic does not automatically mean unsafe or bad. To say otherwise
   is the naturalistic fallacy. And another thing to keep in mind is that

Testing,Testing: Goodnight Dust

   Posted by Madisyn Fecko on August 25, 2016August 24, 2016 in beauty

   How do our fave Beauty & Wellness products really stack up?

   I love reading a good review. Did it smell as good as they say it does?
   Did your hair actually look wavy? Did the sweater actually fit in that
   “cute but slouchy” way? Was it soft or itchy? How has the vegan leather
   held up? Did your lips dry out? How many times a day did you apply?

   You get the idea.

   In this series, I’m going to be the guinea pig, journaling my thoughts
   and spilling the beans on those I love. After all, life is all about
   trial and error.

   Meet: Goodnight Dust

   Size: 2.2 oz (15.5 servings per jar)

   Initial reaction: I. Love. This. Packaging.

   What’s Up? I have a hard time sleeping. Like. Really hard. I go to bed
   super early (I’m 24 going on 84, granny panties included), and wake up
   very, very early. In the in-between hours, I’m struggling. Big time. I
   have a hard time falling asleep, my mind constantly running. Once I’m
   out, I toss and turn, wake up about 5 times and, next thing I know,
   it’s time to begin my day. I’ve tried melatonin, that didn’t work. The
   chemicals in other sleeping aids scared me off. So I felt stuck, and
   honestly a bit hopeless. When we launched our Beauty &
   Wellness assortment, I randomly stumbled upon Goodnight Dust. I was
   frustrated, tired and ready to try something new. So, I pressed order…
   and here’s what I got.

   Journal.

   Entry 1: When my order arrived, I was delighted by its packaging —
   clean, beautiful graphics, calming color, all in a glass jar (which is
   always a positive). Here are the things I was quick to love before my
   first use:

   The product is a Certified Vegan Ingestible.

   All Organic.

   Only five ingredients!

   Entry 2: Last night I mixed 8 oz. of cold purified water with 1 tsp of
   Goodnight Dust. The flavor is very herbal. It went down smoothly. My
   stomach didn’t hurt afterward, and I didn’t feel, well, drunk, (as some
   sleeping aids can do). I crawled into bed, and did some reading. Within
   about 30 minutes, I started feeling relaxed. I wasn’t my usual jittery,
   anxious self but, instead, felt soothed and calm. I woke up this
   morning, at my usual body-clock time of 6am, and realized I wasn’t up
   and down the entire night. I didn’t feel sluggish, or drained. Most
   importantly, to me, I didn’t have that heavy, drowsy feeling. So far,
   so good.

   Entry 3: I’m on my third night of using Goodnight Dust, and I’ve had a
   great experience so far. Tonight I am mixing it with almond milk, which
   I warmed up on the stove. The cold water is fine and quick, but the
   warmth and nutty flavor is adding a well-received cozy factor.

   Entry 4: I slept well last night, but think I need to better time my
   dosage. I got up once to use the restroom, and I think it’s due
   to drinking 8 oz of something right before bed. Too much information?
   That’s what I’m here for!

   Entry 5: I’m a week out so far, and I can truly say I’m over the moon
   (get it), about this stuff. Overall, I fall into a deeper sleep without
   having those two am wake-ups. My almond milk concoction is delicious,
   and I don’t feel guilty about having to use a sleep aid. That’s been
   the worst thing about my previous journey to find good rest — what I
   was ingesting was far from ideal. This time, I’m happy about both the
   ingredients and my peaceful sleep.

   This series is all about trying new things. I’d love to hear your ideas
   about what to try next — from overalls to lip balm. Let me know in the
   comments!

   Thank you for sharing this. I have the same problem, tossing and
   turning. I’m unable to fall asleep till after midnight then I wake up
   multiple times in the night until I just give up and start my day. In a
   drowsy and grouchy mood.

Rewind The Tape: Get Angela & Rayanne’s 90’s Looks

   Posted by fp julia on August 14, 2012August 14, 2012 in fashion
   [cast-of-my-so-called-life-5-600x450.jpg]

   When we launched our Rad in Plaid lookbook this week I immediately
   thought of My So Called Life.  There is no question that it is the TV
   show I have related to the most and it may have only lasted one season,
   but that one season was good enough to still stand out in my mind as
   one of the best shows of all time. Angela Chase and Rayanne Graff were
   the epitome of 90’s fashion, wearing plaid mixed with florals,
   mis-matched prints, layers upon layers and pulling it off with an
   effortlessness that was always so inspiring. I always admired Rayanne’s
   free spirit and wild attitude, but I think deep down I related much
   more to Angela.  I see elements of both in our Rad In Plaid lookbook
   and I’m excited that this trend is having a moment again, because it
   has always been a favorite of mine. See how to get Angela and Rayanne’s
   looks below with some of our current product!

   I love the 90’s! The grunge look appeals to me very much! I also love
   the outfits Britney & The Spice Girls wore during their performances (
   bandana shaped tops, wide leg pants, chunky platform shoes). I think it
   was a transitional decade fashion-wise, because the 80’s styles were
   definitely in the mix, but new silhouettes and ideas came about as
   well. I like seeing these trends come back!
