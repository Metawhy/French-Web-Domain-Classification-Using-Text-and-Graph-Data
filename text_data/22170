About

   Thinker Thing allows anyone to custom manufacture their own perfect
   product

Problem

   3D printing, what the economist calls the next industrial revolution is
   based on a simple promise, the ability to custom manufacture a real
   object from a computer model. But who builds these computer models?
   Current 3D printer software is based on outdated concepts from the
   80’s. It’s difficult to use and takes years for professional designers
   to learn.

   How much of a revolution will this be if only a handful of
   professionals can create for this technology?

Our Solution

   At Thinker Thing we have developed a radical new process that can build
   real objects using just your preferences.
   A touch screen user interface so simple and natural that even young
   children can custom manufacture their own perfect product from their
   mobile phone.
   A 3D printer is not required, our applications seamlessly integrate
   with current and mature 3D printer services like Shapeways. The
   customer simply presses print and their object arrives in the post in
   the material of their choice, plastic, full colour, rubber,
   brass, ceramic, silver & gold utilizing the latest and best
   printer technologies for as little as $6.

   Our mobile app can be learned in seconds and will have you building
   your own perfect products in minutes!
