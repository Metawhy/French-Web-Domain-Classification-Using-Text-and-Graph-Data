Values

   Respect, effort, ambition, teamwork and humility are the five principal
   values that define the spirit of FC Barcelona

   VALUES

VALUES


   RESPECT
   Respect for others is one of the basic requirements of democratic life
   and the capacity to live in society. It affects the individual and has
   both a social and a collective dimension. Respect is a fundamental part
   of sport, for sport generates situations of tension that have to be
   resolved almost instantaneously. There is therefore a need, above rules
   and standards, for this value to be present in order to guarantee
   cordial and correct interrelations between people. In sport, respect is
   needed in similar situations to those where it is demanded in wider
   society, but the intensity of the moment implies that the presence or
   absence of respect can be very obvious and can affect the development
   of the situation or event.

   EFFORT
   There are many social models that avoid effort and advocate instead
   luck, opportunism and immediate triumph. However, effort is a value
   that can take us to unthinkable heights and lead us to achieve targets
   and objectives that may at other times appear distant or inaccessible.
   Dedication, rigour, constancy, sacrifice and perseverance all bear
   fruit, while luck and the search for a quick win are often fleeting and
   momentary. Note that at school, teachers have for a long time being
   promoting a culture of effort as the vehicle for academic development
   and personal achievement, and this helps to construct new social
   models.

   AMBITION
   Ambition is the desire to achieve the maximum performance and do things
   not only well but also as well as is feasibly possible and to improve
   every day. This value is applicable both to individuals and to groups.
   It involves use of a web of values as varied as excellence, patience,
   discipline, order, motivation and responsibility. Indeed, ambition
   invokes and requires a broad system of values and, in turn, is related
   with a job being done well, effort and rigour. Regarding targets,
   ambition is probably the surest way of achieving them, for it is the
   impulse to grow.

   TEAMWORK
   Teamwork implies that the subject forms part of a group and that, as a
   member of the same, becomes an active element that acts on behalf of
   the whole (sometimes even to the determine of their own individuality).
   There are undeniable benefits of knowing that you are part of a team
   and this requires the learning and accentuation of many other values.

   HUMILITY
   Often when athletes, and people in general, achieve the goals they have
   set themselves, they start feeling superior in physical, moral,
   economic and other terms, and this leads them to forget certain values
   that have in all probability helped them to achieved those very goals:
   effort, perseverance, self-control, etc. We are all aware of how FC
   Barcelona has dealt with its victories of recent years, and how it has
   always shown humility (and also such values as effort, rigour,
   responsibility and others) to win respect in its field, and among its
   opponents, and generally everyone. Humility probably consists of
   knowing how to be clear about one’s values, and to maintain them and
   defend them even in situations where you are clearly superior and more
   successful.

Values

   Respect, effort, ambition, teamwork and humility are the five principal
   values that define the spirit of FC Barcelona

   VALUES

VALUES


   RESPECT
   Respect for others is one of the basic requirements of democratic life
   and the capacity to live in society. It affects the individual and has
   both a social and a collective dimension. Respect is a fundamental part
   of sport, for sport generates situations of tension that have to be
   resolved almost instantaneously. There is therefore a need, above rules
   and standards, for this value to be present in order to guarantee
   cordial and correct interrelations between people. In sport, respect is
   needed in similar situations to those where it is demanded in wider
   society, but the intensity of the moment implies that the presence or
   absence of respect can be very obvious and can affect the development
   of the situation or event.

   EFFORT
   There are many social models that avoid effort and advocate instead
   luck, opportunism and immediate triumph. However, effort is a value
   that can take us to unthinkable heights and lead us to achieve targets
   and objectives that may at other times appear distant or inaccessible.
   Dedication, rigour, constancy, sacrifice and perseverance all bear
   fruit, while luck and the search for a quick win are often fleeting and
   momentary. Note that at school, teachers have for a long time being
   promoting a culture of effort as the vehicle for academic development
   and personal achievement, and this helps to construct new social
   models.

   AMBITION
   Ambition is the desire to achieve the maximum performance and do things
   not only well but also as well as is feasibly possible and to improve
   every day. This value is applicable both to individuals and to groups.
   It involves use of a web of values as varied as excellence, patience,
   discipline, order, motivation and responsibility. Indeed, ambition
   invokes and requires a broad system of values and, in turn, is related
   with a job being done well, effort and rigour. Regarding targets,
   ambition is probably the surest way of achieving them, for it is the
   impulse to grow.

   TEAMWORK
   Teamwork implies that the subject forms part of a group and that, as a
   member of the same, becomes an active element that acts on behalf of
   the whole (sometimes even to the determine of their own individuality).
   There are undeniable benefits of knowing that you are part of a team
   and this requires the learning and accentuation of many other values.

   HUMILITY
   Often when athletes, and people in general, achieve the goals they have
   set themselves, they start feeling superior in physical, moral,
   economic and other terms, and this leads them to forget certain values
   that have in all probability helped them to achieved those very goals:
   effort, perseverance, self-control, etc. We are all aware of how FC
   Barcelona has dealt with its victories of recent years, and how it has
   always shown humility (and also such values as effort, rigour,
   responsibility and others) to win respect in its field, and among its
   opponents, and generally everyone. Humility probably consists of
   knowing how to be clear about one’s values, and to maintain them and
   defend them even in situations where you are clearly superior and more
   successful.
