   Best parts:
   It was our honeymoon and the agency had prepared many special treats
   for us (champaign, flowers, romantic dinner). Thank you so much for
   that! Our agent Ricardo organized everything perfectly. All guides were
   very interesting, all the organization went well. We felt the agency
   was very professional and understood our needs.
   Worst parts:
   Self driving in Cuba is not easy and can be stressful. If you're not
   used to Latin America, don't choose self driving. The organization was
   great but we would have enjoyed to have more details in advance
   (meeting time with the guides each day, etc) Cuba in August is really
   hot and humid! If we come, we'll choose to come in winter.

   Best parts:
   great organization, and best contact with local agencies to make our
   trip a smooth sailing experience! Everything was perfect in organizing
   our trip to what we wanted at the pace we requested! We spend 10 days
   in cuba with some of the best transfers to the amazing host at each
   location, From our arrival at the airport a company rep. was there to
   welcome us and to make sure our schedule was ready for all tours. This
   was our first time using Evaneos and for sure not our last!
   Worst parts:
   I don't think we had any issues with anything, they accomplished
   everything !

   Maestra mountains,to Camaguey, Sancti Spiritus, Trinidad, Cienfuegos,
   Santa Clara (and the Che mausoleum), Bay of Pigs, Habana, Vinales, Mil

   Best parts:
   It was our honeymoon and the agency had prepared many special treats
   for us (champaign, flowers, romantic dinner). Thank you so much for
   that! Our agent Ricardo organized everything perfectly. All guides were
   very interesting, all the organization went well. We felt the agency
   was very professional and understood our needs.
   Worst parts:
   Self driving in Cuba is not easy and can be stressful. If you're not
   used to Latin America, don't choose self driving. The organization was
   great but we would have enjoyed to have more details in advance
   (meeting time with the guides each day, etc) Cuba in August is really
   hot and humid! If we come, we'll choose to come in winter.

   Best parts:
   great organization, and best contact with local agencies to make our
   trip a smooth sailing experience! Everything was perfect in organizing
   our trip to what we wanted at the pace we requested! We spend 10 days
   in cuba with some of the best transfers to the amazing host at each
   location, From our arrival at the airport a company rep. was there to
   welcome us and to make sure our schedule was ready for all tours. This
   was our first time using Evaneos and for sure not our last!
   Worst parts:
   I don't think we had any issues with anything, they accomplished
   everything !

   We loved Cuba, its people, its landscape and its history. We spent 3
   weeks with a guide travelling from Santiago de Cuba, in the Ierra
   Maestra mountains,to Camaguey, Sancti Spiritus, Trinidad, Cienfuegos,
   Santa Clara (and the Che mausoleum), Bay of Pigs, Habana, Vinales, Mil
   Cumbres and back to Habana. Highlights included the music and Salsa at
   the Casas de la Trova, visits to historical sites and museums, and the
   ascents of Pico Turrquino and Pan de Guajaibon

   loved their trip to Guatemala
     __________________________________________________________________

   Having traveled with Evaneous Travel to Costa Rico last year, I went
   directly to them this year for a trip to Guatemala. I was traveling
   with my son who was on break from grad school. I wanted to get him as
   far away from school and stress as possible. We decided to travel to
   Guatemala. The local agency is a travel company Evaneous works with.
   They were the most organized tour company I have ever traveled with.
   Mary in the office, David R. -our guide- Mr. Edgar, our driver, all
   wonderful and knowledgeable people.

   Best parts:
   Our local agency was SO professional to work with! Their guides,
   drivers and office coordination could not have been any better. Our
   personal guide, David R., was the best guide I have ever had the
   pleasure of working with. They truly customized my trip for MY wants
   and needs. 5 stars to the local agency!

   loved their trip to Mexico
     __________________________________________________________________

   We spent a week in Mexico in and around Valladolid, Mérida and ended
   our trip with a relaxing stay on Holbox Island. I loved being able to
   explore the cenotes (cavernous fresh water swimming holes), Mayan
   archeological sites and the Rio Lagartos water reserve during the
   afternoon and return back to the city of Valladolid or Mérida in the
   evening for a tasty meal of authentic Mayan cuisine. It was a perfect
   mix of outdoor adventure, food and culture. We met many friendly people
   along the way...we made efforts to communicate as much as possible in
   Spanish and it completely enriched our travel experience. A truly
   unforgettable trip!

   We loved swimming in the cenotes, eating all of the delicious Mexican
   food and exploring the Mayan ruins Uxmal, Chichen Itza and Ek Balam.
   Worst parts:
   Everything was perfect!

   time to write such lovely feedback. I am over the moon that you had
   such a great trip in Mexico. You really did visit some of the most
   beautiful spots in the Yucatán Peninsula - Holbox is by far one of my
   favorite places to visit for some relaxation! It's great that you were
   able to try some local food, meet some wonderful people and speak some
   Spanish during your travels! It was an absolute pleasure to help you
   plan your trip, you were both such wonderful customers. If you ever
   find yourselves planning a trip to Mexico again, I would love to show
   you more of what this beautiful country has to offer. All the best from
   sunny Mérida, HarrietSee more

   We had a lot of programs we did for the first time in our lives: -
   floating down on a Maya canal in the Sian Kaan Biosphere Reserve - dive
   in the Grand cenoté - to participate in the urban fiesta in Merida -
   see the Palm sunday procession and the fantastic flower carpets in
   Antigua Guatemala - staying 20 meters from the lava flow on the Pacaya
   volcano - to explore the Mayan world

   Best parts:
   Simply everything. The local partner agency and especially our personal
   travel advisor Ivana have made a perfect job. During the organization,
   she found a solution to all our wishes. The hotels were chosen very
   carefully, all close to the attractions. All of the accommodation was
   special (beach bungallo, chalet in the jungle, hacienda with the inner
   garden ... etc).All tour guides were very kind and calm, and most of
   all they were careful about the exact arrival. We've got a lot of extra
   information about each of their cities, people, habits, and natural
   attractions. Ivana has escorted our journey and has always been
   notified in time if we had to prepare for any change or problem.
   Worst parts:
   the bad thing is that it is over

   Philippe and David, It was an absolute pleasure to help you plan your
   trip to Mexico! Thank you for taking the time to leave us some
   feedback. I'm sorry the room in Mexico City was disappointing, this is
   certainly something we will consider in the future, but I'm really
   happy that the rest of your trip was flawless. You did a really great
   route combining some of my favorite places in Mexico and it's great
   that you had a wonderful experience in each place. I wish you both well

   Keith and Pam
   loved their trip to Panama
     __________________________________________________________________

   We were met on arrival and driven to Gamboa resort, ideally situated
   for numerous trips. We then drove ourselves to numerous places,
   including a place with only 2 rooms which was a sloth sanctuary, a
   couple of mountain lodges, a lovely place at Bocca Chica, seagull cove,
   which has just 5 individual bungalows overlooking the cove, where
   kayaks were available. We finished our 23 day tour with a couple of
   days exploring Panama city. Everything worked like clockwork thanks to
   Philippe and his team.

   Best parts:
   Most of it. It was a well planned trip, allowing us to get a good cross
   section of what Panama has to offer. The fact that we had a hire car
   meant that we could set our own pace. From trekking in the rain forests
   to lying in a hammock on a tiny island, the whole thing was superb.
   Worst parts:
   Getting pulled for speeding! The large size of Gamboa resort, which is
   geared up primary to cater for coach tours rather than individual
   travellers.
