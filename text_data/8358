   Our Story

   In 1825, in the shadow of Somerset's famous Glastonbury Tor, brothers
   Cyrus and James Clark founded a footwear company that would become like
   no other. At its heart was a belief in craft, innovation and comfort.
   With more firsts than any other name in footwear these principles live
   on 190 years later.
