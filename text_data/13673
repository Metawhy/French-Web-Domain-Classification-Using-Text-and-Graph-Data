What You Need to Know About Today’s LGBTQ Rights Arguments Before SCOTUS

   A crowd celebrates outside of the Supreme Court in Washington after the
   court declared that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in
   the U.S.

   Today, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in three cases in which
   the Trump administration is urging the court to rule that it’s legal to
   fire workers for being LGBTQ.

   For the LGBTQ civil rights movement, this is a big moment. These cases
   will affect more people than the Supreme Court’s decision about the
   freedom to marry, and they potentially implicate a broader range of
   contexts in which LGBTQ people may face harm, if the Court green-lights
   discrimination. Worse still, a bad ruling would strip away protections
   against discrimination that LGBTQ people have been able to use to
   protect themselves for two decades. And all this in a context where
   nearly one in three transgender people has experienced discrimination
   in the workplace.

   In short, the stakes are very high.

   One of the cases is about the rights of transgender people and involves
   Aimee Stephens, who worked for nearly six years as a funeral director
   at a funeral home near Detroit. Earlier in her life, Aimee had
   considered going into the ministry, but then found her calling in
   funeral services, where she could help comfort people in a time of
   great need. Her employer knew her as a man, but Aimee knew from five
   years old that she was female. After decades of hiding who she really
   was, Aimee could bear it no more, realizing that the only way to live
   was as her true self. She gathered the strength to come out to her
   family, friends, and co-workers as a woman. When she introduced herself
   as Aimee to her boss, he fired her. He made no pretense about any
   performance reason; he openly admitted that it was because she is
   transgender, saying, “this isn’t going to work out.”

   The other two cases both involve men who were fired because they are
   gay. In one case, Gerald Bostock was fired from his job as a social
   worker for at-risk youth after his employer found out he was gay. The
   third case involves is Don Zarda, who worked as an instructor for a
   skydiving outfit on Long Island, New York. Don had become hooked on
   skydiving years earlier, and it evolved from being his passion to being
   his profession as well. He loved introducing others to the sport. Don
   often took customers on tandem jumps, where they are strapped to him
   shoulder-to-shoulder and hip-to-hip before they jump from the plane.
   One day, Don told a female customer that he was gay in an effort to
   make her less uncomfortable with how close they were physically. He
   thought nothing of the remark, but his boss later fired him for sharing
   “inappropriate information” with a customer.

   When Don called his sister Melissa to tell her he’d been fired, her
   first reaction was surprise and disbelief. “It’s not legal to fire you
   because you’re gay,” she told him. And she’s right. Lower courts in
   both Don’s and Aimee’s cases ruled that their firings violate federal
   civil rights law, because the employers treated them differently
   because of their sex. After all, the courts reasoned, if Aimee had been
   assigned a female sex at birth, her employer would not have fired her
   for being and living as the woman she is. And if Don had been a woman
   attracted to men, as opposed to a man attracted to men, he would not
   have been fired for sharing that information with a customer.

   Big picture: it’s hard to see how firing someone for being LGBTQ
   doesn’t involve the person’s sex. You can’t even describe being trans
   or gay without talking about the individuals’ sex. At its core, the
   federal ban on sex discrimination is simple: workers are not supposed
   to be treated differently because of their sex.

   There is an enormous amount at stake in these cases. LGBTQ people could
   lose protections against discrimination that they have relied on in
   many cases for two decades. Going back to 2000, federal appeals courts
   have ruled that anti-trans discrimination is a form of sex
   discrimination that violates federal law, providing a remedy for trans
   workers fired for who they are. The Equal Employment Opportunity
   Commission, tasked with enforcing the federal workplace
   non-discrimination law, agrees that anti-LGBTQ discrimination is a form
   of sex discrimination, and has recovered millions of dollars for LGBTQ
   workers who sued over discrimination.

   And a decision in these cases could affect LGBTQ people in contexts
   well beyond just the workplace. LGBTQ people have relied on federal
   protections against sex discrimination to redress housing
   discrimination, to combat discrimination in schools, and to remedy
   discrimination in health care. All of these protections could be swept
   away if the court deletes LGBTQ people from the existing scope of the
   federal civil rights laws.

   A ruling in these cases could affect non-LGBTQ people as well. A
   crucial Supreme Court precedent for Aimee and Don’s cases is that of
   Ann Hopkins. As an employee at accounting firm Price Waterhouse,
   Hopkins was passed over for partner and told she could increase her
   chances if she would "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress
   more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry."
   The Supreme Court ruled that requiring her to conform to stereotypes
   associated with being a woman demonstrated sex discrimination.

   Many federal courts have concluded that firing LGBTQ people because we
   don’t meet employers’ stereotypes of how women and men should act,
   identify, and appear is just as much sex discrimination as passing over
   Ann Hopkins because she was considered “macho.”

   But if the Supreme Court says in Aimee’s and Don’s cases that this
   reasoning doesn’t apply to LGBTQ people, that could spell trouble for
   everyone. We could return to a world where employers can fire anyone —
   straight or gay, transgender or not — for not being the “right kind” of
   woman or man. Scary stuff.

   The ACLU is proud to represent Aimee and Don, and to fight alongside
   Gerald, as we urge the Supreme Court not to roll back the rights of
   LGBTQ people and not to eviscerate sex discrimination protections for
   everyone else in the process.

   woman or man. Scary stuff.

   The ACLU is proud to represent Aimee and Don, and to fight alongside
   Gerald, as we urge the Supreme Court not to roll back the rights of
   LGBTQ people and not to eviscerate sex discrimination protections for
   everyone else in the process.

What You Need to Know About Today’s LGBTQ Rights Arguments Before SCOTUS

   A crowd celebrates outside of the Supreme Court in Washington after the
   court declared that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in
   the U.S.

   Today, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in three cases in which
   the Trump administration is urging the court to rule that it’s legal to
   fire workers for being LGBTQ.

   For the LGBTQ civil rights movement, this is a big moment. These cases
   will affect more people than the Supreme Court’s decision about the
   freedom to marry, and they potentially implicate a broader range of
   contexts in which LGBTQ people may face harm, if the Court green-lights
   discrimination. Worse still, a bad ruling would strip away protections
   against discrimination that LGBTQ people have been able to use to
   protect themselves for two decades. And all this in a context where
   nearly one in three transgender people has experienced discrimination
   in the workplace.

   In short, the stakes are very high.

   One of the cases is about the rights of transgender people and involves
   Aimee Stephens, who worked for nearly six years as a funeral director
   at a funeral home near Detroit. Earlier in her life, Aimee had
   considered going into the ministry, but then found her calling in
   funeral services, where she could help comfort people in a time of
   great need. Her employer knew her as a man, but Aimee knew from five
   years old that she was female. After decades of hiding who she really
   was, Aimee could bear it no more, realizing that the only way to live
   was as her true self. She gathered the strength to come out to her
   family, friends, and co-workers as a woman. When she introduced herself
   as Aimee to her boss, he fired her. He made no pretense about any
   performance reason; he openly admitted that it was because she is
   transgender, saying, “this isn’t going to work out.”

   The other two cases both involve men who were fired because they are
   gay. In one case, Gerald Bostock was fired from his job as a social
   worker for at-risk youth after his employer found out he was gay. The
   third case involves is Don Zarda, who worked as an instructor for a
   skydiving outfit on Long Island, New York. Don had become hooked on
   skydiving years earlier, and it evolved from being his passion to being
   his profession as well. He loved introducing others to the sport. Don
   often took customers on tandem jumps, where they are strapped to him
   shoulder-to-shoulder and hip-to-hip before they jump from the plane.
   One day, Don told a female customer that he was gay in an effort to
   make her less uncomfortable with how close they were physically. He
   thought nothing of the remark, but his boss later fired him for sharing
   “inappropriate information” with a customer.

   When Don called his sister Melissa to tell her he’d been fired, her
   first reaction was surprise and disbelief. “It’s not legal to fire you
   because you’re gay,” she told him. And she’s right. Lower courts in
   both Don’s and Aimee’s cases ruled that their firings violate federal
   civil rights law, because the employers treated them differently
   because of their sex. After all, the courts reasoned, if Aimee had been
   assigned a female sex at birth, her employer would not have fired her
   for being and living as the woman she is. And if Don had been a woman
   attracted to men, as opposed to a man attracted to men, he would not
   have been fired for sharing that information with a customer.

   Big picture: it’s hard to see how firing someone for being LGBTQ
   doesn’t involve the person’s sex. You can’t even describe being trans
   or gay without talking about the individuals’ sex. At its core, the
   federal ban on sex discrimination is simple: workers are not supposed
   to be treated differently because of their sex.

   There is an enormous amount at stake in these cases. LGBTQ people could
   lose protections against discrimination that they have relied on in
   many cases for two decades. Going back to 2000, federal appeals courts
   have ruled that anti-trans discrimination is a form of sex
   discrimination that violates federal law, providing a remedy for trans
   workers fired for who they are. The Equal Employment Opportunity
   Commission, tasked with enforcing the federal workplace
   non-discrimination law, agrees that anti-LGBTQ discrimination is a form
   of sex discrimination, and has recovered millions of dollars for LGBTQ
   workers who sued over discrimination.

   And a decision in these cases could affect LGBTQ people in contexts
   well beyond just the workplace. LGBTQ people have relied on federal
   protections against sex discrimination to redress housing
   discrimination, to combat discrimination in schools, and to remedy
   discrimination in health care. All of these protections could be swept
   away if the court deletes LGBTQ people from the existing scope of the
   federal civil rights laws.

   A ruling in these cases could affect non-LGBTQ people as well. A
   crucial Supreme Court precedent for Aimee and Don’s cases is that of
   Ann Hopkins. As an employee at accounting firm Price Waterhouse,
   Hopkins was passed over for partner and told she could increase her
   chances if she would "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress
   more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry."
   The Supreme Court ruled that requiring her to conform to stereotypes
   associated with being a woman demonstrated sex discrimination.

   Many federal courts have concluded that firing LGBTQ people because we
   don’t meet employers’ stereotypes of how women and men should act,
   identify, and appear is just as much sex discrimination as passing over
   Ann Hopkins because she was considered “macho.”

   But if the Supreme Court says in Aimee’s and Don’s cases that this
   reasoning doesn’t apply to LGBTQ people, that could spell trouble for
   everyone. We could return to a world where employers can fire anyone —
   straight or gay, transgender or not — for not being the “right kind” of
   woman or man. Scary stuff.

   The ACLU is proud to represent Aimee and Don, and to fight alongside
   Gerald, as we urge the Supreme Court not to roll back the rights of
   LGBTQ people and not to eviscerate sex discrimination protections for
   everyone else in the process.
