Belief in 'Balance of Nature' Hard to Shake

   Take that, hakuna matata. The Disney-fied notion that, left to its own
   devices, nature will always revert to an idyllic equilibrium is a
   dangerous fallacy, say two researchers. The cultural bias colors
   discussions on climate change.

   It is a belief system that has burrowed deep in our psyches; a way of
   thinking that is extremely resistant to serious challenge. Yet it may
   be hindering our ability to intelligently consider the consequences of
   climate change.

   It is the "balance of nature," a concept pretty much everyone
   accepts—with the notable exception of ecologists. The natural
   environment, as it is currently understood by science, is in a constant
   state of flux.

   Upheaval, not balance, is the norm.

   That we believe otherwise has proven problematic for the teaching of
   basic ecological literacy, according to a just-published paper by
   psychologist Corinne Zimmerman of Illinois State University and
   ecologist Kim Cuddington of Ohio University. Their study of students at
   two major Midwestern universities found the discredited "balance of
   nature" idea is widely held among both science majors and the general
   student population. Whatʼs more, it is extremely difficult to dislodge.

   "Theyʼre almost unable to reason logically about environmental problems
   because they keep bumping into this cultural concept," Cuddington says.
   "Itʼs influencing their thought processes."

   While it is tempting to blame Walt Disney, given the balance-of-nature
   theme in The Lion King (where it is called the "circle of life"), the
   concept can be traced back to the beginnings of Western thought.
   Herodotus, the ancient Greek who is widely considered the first
   historian, "describes the relationship between predator and prey
   species," Cuddington says. "He calls it wonderful that theyʼre exactly
   balanced—that the predators never eat too many of the prey."

   The staying power of this idea became clear when she asked students in
   her introduction to ecology course, "Do you think a predator could ever
   drive a prey species to extinction?"

   "They uniformly answer no—even though it does happen all the time," she
   says. "You get the sense from their responses that the cheetah and the
   antelope meet out on the savannah, shake paws or hooves, and say: ʼMake
   sure there are enough of you to eat, and weʼll make sure you donʼt go
   extinct. Deal?ʼ Thatʼs the level of reasoning they have about the
   predator-prey dynamic."

   The concept filtered down through the ages in various forms.
   Nineteenth-century Christian thinkers such as Herbert Spencer and
   William Paley considered it proof of a divinely inspired order in
   nature. In the 1960s and ʼ70s, it became the mantra of the
   environmental movement; the pollution caused by human beings, it was
   argued, was upsetting the planetʼs natural balance.

   "In its classic formulation, the balance-of-nature concept holds that
   an ecosystem maintains a constant equilibrium and, when disturbed, it
   returns to its former status when the cause of the disturbance is
   disturbed," William K. Stevens wrote in the New York Times in 1990. He
   was, in a sense, writing the ideaʼs obituary. "Many scientists now say
   it is clear that this is not the way things work," Stevens continued,
   adding that "nature is actually in a continuing state of disturbance
   and fluctuation."

   Nearly two decades later, this new understanding has yet to filter down
   to the general public—or, for that matter, the educational community.

   "I did a search of science standards issued by state education boards,
   which list the things we need to teach our students about biology and
   ecology," Zimmerman says. "The national standards donʼt say anything
   about the balance of nature, but there are state and school-board
   documents that list the concept as something students should exit a
   particular grade level knowing."

   Given that the pervasiveness of that "deep-seated cultural notion,"
   Cuddington was not surprised to discover it was widely believed by
   students in her introduction to ecology class. She was surprised, and
   disappointed, by her lack of success at convincing the students—even
   the science majors—that they were mistaken.

   "We had students consider a scenario where a lake was contaminated with
   copper due to either a train derailment or a landslide," she says.
   "This would profoundly influence the ecosystem. But 93 percent of them
   (mistakenly) thought the system would recover."

   Zimmerman believes such findings may explain why it has been so
   difficult to forge a consensus on combating climate change, in spite of
   widespread predictions of unprecedented events such as the melting of
   the polar ice cap. "People think: ʼEverything will be OK. Itʼll all
   balance out in the end,ʼ" she says.

   "There are two (mutually contradictory) ideas inherent in this
   balance-of-nature concept," she adds. "One is that nature is really
   robust. You can dump copper in a lake and itʼll recover! The other is
   that nature is really delicate, and practically anything you do to it
   will destroy it. You can have two people talking about ‘the balance of
   nature,ʼ but one could be using a robust conception and the other a
   delicate conception."

   This muddying of the metaphorical waters is hardly conducive to
   intelligent consideration of the environmental challenges we face. As
   Stevens wrote in 1990: "The real question, ecologists say, is which
   sort of human interventions should be promoted and which opposed." The
   "balance of nature" idea, with its implication that the natural world
   would revert to a peaceful, idyllic state of man simply kept his hands
   off, does not lend itself to a serious exploration of that question.

   The first step in solving this problem, the authors of the study
   contend, is educating the educators—specifically, middle school and
   high school teachers, many of whom are currently spreading
   misinformation. "Perhaps if they really understood the concepts (of
   contemporary ecology), they can teach them to kids before their minds
   are totally locked," Zimmerman says.

   "If we better educate our science teachers, hopefully they will better
   educate our science students," Cuddington agrees. "I donʼt know what is
   required in terms of changing instructional techniques. But certainly
   the first step is to make sure students are getting accurate
   information—regardless of whether or not they take it in."
