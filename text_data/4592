Wrapping excellence

   The art of wrapping is truly something that Chanel understands. I
   received this parcel today and it's pure joy to unpack a box like this.
   Every detail is considered and even if it's an easy trick to make
   customers feel special they have really succeed! Also since I'm an Art
   Director and fan of lovely packages generally this one really made me
   smile. Happy weekend!

Colours of an island

   Last weekend we went to Gotland the largest island of Sweden. We went
   to the northern part called Fårö. The colour scale was just beautiful.
   The pale grays and whites on stones and rocks, the green and yellow
   lichens and the small treehouses in different browns. Not to forget the
   blue sky and sea. Nature is a great source of inspiration. Photo: Mia

   As you might know I spend part of the week painting. I love to paint
   horses but also abstract motifs. You kan find these ones at Urban
   Living, reopening in Kivik this easter and soon also online. You can
   find more of my art att mialinnman.se  Wish you a great new week! Photo

Ugly is nice

   [vase%2B1.jpg]
   [vase%2B2.jpg]
   Is this vase ugly or just lovely? Of course that's up to each
   individual to decide. I think the weirdness   and the fact that it's a
   human hand, not a machine, that shaped it makes it beautiful. The non
   perfect is the most interesting if you ask me. Photo: Mia Linnman

Inspiration

   [table.jpg]
   [Vogue.jpg]
   To be inspired is one of my favorite feelings. Those days when you're
   out of it, it will probably come if you just get started, don't wait
   for it to happen. Sometimes you get it just by looking at something or
   meet with someone you like. I bought this magazine only because of the
   cover. The colors, the layout, the model and the composition is just
   perfect. I can't say much about the written content since I know about
   ten Spanish words ... The table above is one of my own designs that I
   will tell you about later. Happy weekend! Photo: Mia Linnman.

Long time no see

   [Tulips%2B1.jpg]
   [Tulips%2B3.jpg]
   Hi guys! Yes, I guess I have written that headline before. My blog
   activity has been just as the tulips above, out of glow, inspiration
   and energy for a long, long time. Suddenly I felt inspiration, that
   picking up the camera, shooting some pics made me happy. I hope that
   feeling will stay and that I'll meet you soon again. Photo Mia Linnman

   Hi everyone! Back on track. Hope you've had a lovey summer.
   Last week I was invited to a really fantastic launch of the new
   wallpaper collection L’Hôtel from Sandberg wallpaper. It took place in
   the fantastic Villa Strömsfors with a bunch of really nice people.
   Right now I just want to buy an old charming house with high ceilings
   and cover the walls with this french pariasian inspired beauties. More
   lovely pictures from the collection and the villa at Sandberg

The lounge

   [loungestatue%2B2.jpg]
   [loungestatue.jpg]
   The lounge in the background is one of my favourite places in the
   house, a place for talking and discussions, a place to enjoy a typical
   swedish "fika" (which means coffee with cookies or buns) or an
   afternoon drink, a dry martini or just a glass of wine. A perfect place
   to read and relax. The iron  shelves are made from my sketches by local
   craftsmen. I´ll show you more of my iron projects next time. Happy
   friday! Photo: Mia Linnman

   This last month has been amazing! Sunny and warm every day, and I mean
   EVERY day for the last four weeks. We've also got a new little lovely
   person in our family – my husbands oldest daughter's second child; the
   cutest little boy you can imagine. Happy new week! Photo: Mia Linnman

Summertime

   [bench.jpg]
   Last time I blogged it was still winter and now it's early summer. Time
   flies and I don't really know if it's lack of inspiration, time or
   reason to keep this blog running. Anyway, here's a picture for you who
   still visiting this place. Hope you're well. Photo: Mia Linnman.

Winter

   [Lasse.jpg]
   [skridsko.jpg]
   [royalwedding.jpg]
   Winter came some weeks ago. And when that's a fact you just have to
   embrace it even if I'm longing for the first signs of spring. Hot cocoa
   and skating on shiny ice isn't bad after all.
   Finally got some pictures on the wall above the shelves made by a local
   blacksmith.  Photo: Mia Linnman

Sunday

   [livingroom.jpg]
   [studio.jpg]
   Back home after an inspiring Art expedition in London last weekend.
   Luckily everything went fine with unmounting (and mounting) the
   canvases and transporting it all. After an intense period of painting
   it felt good to put the studio back to order. I also made some
   refurnishing, one chair ended up in the living room and the other in
   the studio. I also got the old Ikea coffee table out of the storage.
   (The Wassily Chair, also known as the Model B3 chair, was designed by
   Marcel Breuer in 1925-1926.) Photo: Mia Linnman

Art Fair

   [horseandhummingbird.jpg]
   [paint%2B2.jpg]
   [paint.jpg]
   New year and new challenges! This year I have promised myself to dare
   more, to step outside my comfort zone and release the need of control.
   A part of this is to participate to Parallax Art Fair in Kensington,
   London this weekend. It will be great fun and exciting to do something
   new. There's also some new work on my website. Photo: Mia Linnman.

   We spent New Years Eve in Cannes, France. It's really a pleasure to be
   there off season.
   Soon january has come to an end, a fresh year is laying before us with
   opportunities and adventures. Isn't that wonderful? Luckily I have no
   personal complaints of 2017. Me and my family is healthy, we have the
   privilege to travel the world and there's harmony in our lives. I hope
   for love and peace to everyone and the earth this year! Let's go!
