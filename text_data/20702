Welcome! I’m Angie.

   Hello! My name is Angie Olson and I am the teacher, author, and
   curriculum designer behind Lucky Little Learners. I created Lucky
   Little Learners as a way to connect with other teachers around the
   world. I develop lesson plans, printables, centers, interactive
   notebooks, activities, and resources for other teachers. My products
   are primarily focused around first and second grade. I have taught
   kindergarten, first, and second grade. I received my master’s degree in
   mathematics and especially love to create products and posts about
   math.
