   Caroline’s classes are very special! They are fun, interactive and
   exciting!
   She is a great teacher that thoughtfully prepares materials for the
   classes addressing students individual needs and level of their
   language. Her program and homeworks are very versatile: she uses audio
   assignments, provides recorded feedback on homeworks, shows many
   relevant video files and songs, utilizes game format, and makes the
   learning process very enjoyable. She has a great personality and is
   really passionate about teaching! I am so lucky I have found her! I am
   confident that she will help me to learn speaking and understanding
   french in the most effective and efficient way.  Thank you for the
   great classes! You are awesome, Caroline!

   I can neither thank nor recommend Caroline enough. In a mere fifteen
   hours of class time, she was able to do more for me than all the
   self-help French books in the world. As someone who is imminently
   leaving for France, I cannot imagine a better resource to have
   discovered than our Skype lessons; I only wish I had had more, and know
   I will be returning in the future for clarification. If you’re on the
   fence as to which professor you should have a go with, Caroline is the
   ticket. Merci beaucoup, mon amie.
