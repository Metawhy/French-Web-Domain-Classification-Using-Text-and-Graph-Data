Premium Plan Usage Rates and Limits

   This page is only for customers with the new version of the Google Maps
   APIs Premium Plan, which became available in January 2016.

   Have the Premium Plan or a previous license?
   To determine which license you have:
   > In the Google Cloud Support Portal, click Maps: Usage Report on the
   left.
   > Does the ID at the top of the report have the following format?
      gme-[company] & proj-[number] ([type])
   If yes, you have the Premium Plan.
   If no, you have a previous license (Maps APIs for Work or Maps API for
   Business).

Usage rates

   With the Google Maps APIs Premium Plan, your application consumes quota
   at different rates, depending on the APIs it requests.

Maps APIs Credits

   As a Premium Plan customer, you purchase quota—called Maps APIs
   Credits—for one or more years, based on an estimate of your
   application's annual usage. All of your application's requests for Maps
   APIs consume credits from the pool of credits you purchased. For
   example, if your application uses the Maps JavaScript API to display a
   map, it will consume credits for the Maps JavaScript API map loads. If
   your application consumes all of the credits in the pool, you can
   purchase additional credits, as needed.

Usage rates by API

   This type of API request... Consumes this many Maps APIs Credits...
   Maps JavaScript API map load 1
   Maps Static API, Street View Static API map load
   0.25
   Street View Static API metadata request
   0
   Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS) map load 1
   Places API server-side and client-side request; excluding Place
   Autocomplete 2
   Place Autocomplete (server-side and client-side) request 0.1
   Web service APIs (server-side) request: Geocoding API, Directions API,
   Distance Matrix API (per element), Elevation API, Geolocation API, Time
   Zone API, Roads API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)
   Client-side request: Geocoding API, Directions API, Distance Matrix API
   (per element), Elevation API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)

Map loads

   Web APIs:

   A single map load is charged when any of the following occur:
     * A web page or application displays a map using the Maps JavaScript
       API.
     * An application requests a single map image from the Maps Static
       API.

   Street View panoramas are charged separately from map loads:
     * A static Street View panorama is charged for each request to the
       Street View Static API to embed a static (non-interactive) Street
       View panorama.
     * A dynamic Street View panorama is charged for each instantiation of
       a panorama object in a Maps JavaScript API, Maps SDK for Android,
       Maps SDK for iOS application.

   After a web page or application loads a map, or a static map image, or
   a Street View panorama, any user interactions with it, such as panning,
   zooming, or switching map layers, do not generate additional map loads
   or affect usage limits.

   Mobile SDKs:

   A single map load is charged for each instantiation of a Google map or
   panorama object in an Android or iOS mobile application:
     * A GMSMapView or GMSPanoramaView object on iOS.
     * One of MapFragment, SupportMapFragment, MapView,
       StreetViewPanoramaFragment, SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment, or
       StreetViewPanoramaView on Android. A map load is counted each time
       the related onCreate() method is called.

   Once a mobile application loads a map or a Street View panorama, any
   user interactions with it do not generate additional map loads or
   affect usage limits.

Places API usage

   Requests for Place Search, Details, and Photos are charged separately
   from requests for Place Autocomplete. For example, in an Autocomplete
   widget, if a user enters an average of 5 characters (keystrokes) to
   find a place, and the user then selects that place to get details about
   it, your application consumes credits as follows:

   5 Place Autocomplete requests × 0.1 (0.5 credits) + Place Details
   (place selection) request (2 credits) = 2.5 credits

   The Places SDK for Android and the Places SDK for iOS are not available
   for sale and therefore not included with the Premium Plan.

Usage Limits

Total usage limits

   All of your application's requests for APIs consume Maps APIs Credits.
   Therefore, your application's total usage limit is determined by the
   number of credits you purchased. If you run out of Maps APIs Credits,
   your application's requests will continue to succeed, but your account
   may be subject to overage fees. In this case, you'll need to renew your
   Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license as soon as possible to avoid a
   suspension of your account. As you consume your quota, Google sends
   consumption notices via email based on the following increments: at 25%
   used (if used within the first 60 days), 50%, 75%, 85%, 100%, 110%, and
   130%.

Maps JavaScript API

   Requests for the Maps JavaScript API that generate map loads are
   applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you purchased for
   your Premium Plan.

Maps JavaScript API services (client side)

   The following are usage limits for client-side services that your
   application requests from the Maps JavaScript API:
   Service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. Rate limit applied per
   user session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. Rate limit applied per user
   session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Geocoding Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Rate limit applied per user session, regardless of how many
   users share the same project.**
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 100 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Note: requests
   using mode=transit or using the optional parameter departure_time when
   mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request. Rate limit
   applied per user session, regardless of how many users share the same
   project.**

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily
   free requests do not apply to Location Services licenses.

   ** When you first load the API, you are allocated an initial quota of
   requests. Once you use this quota, the API enforces rate limits on
   additional requests on a per-second basis. If too many requests are
   made within a certain time period, the API returns an OVER_QUERY_LIMIT
   response code. The per-session rate limit prevents the use of
   client-side services for batch requests, such as batch geocoding. For
   batch requests, use our web service APIs.

Google Maps Mobile SDKs

   Services Limits

   Maps SDK for Android
   Maps SDK for iOS

   Each map load is applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits
   purchased for your Premium Plan

Google Maps Image APIs

          Services        Limits
   Maps Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels, depending on the scale
   parameter, as explained below.
   Street View Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels.

   Note that Street View Static API metadata requests are free and do not
   consume any Maps APIs Credits.

   Your application can request Maps Static API images up to 2048 by 2048
   pixels. Because the scale value in a static map request affects the
   number of pixels returned, the maximum size value is different for each
   scale level:
   Scale Max Size   Returns
   1     2048x2048 2048x2048
   2     1024x1024 2048x2048
   4     512x512   2048x2048

   The Street View Static API does not support the scale parameter.

Web service APIs

   Web service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. 50** requests per second.
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. 50** requests per second.

   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 625 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Rate limit of 1,000 elements
   per second. Note: requests using the optional parameter departure_time
   when mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request.
   Geolocation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Time Zone Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Roads Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second. Each request may contain up to 100
   points.

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily

Data Dumps

   The Freebase API has been shut down. This page provides access to the
   last available data dump.

   Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They
   constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema
   that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The
   Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples

   This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.
     * Total triples: 1.9 billion
     * Updated: Weekly
     * Data Format: N-Triples RDF
     * License: CC-BY

   22 GB gzip
   250 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8
   text and compressed with Gzip.

ax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .

   If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more
   efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the
   data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .

   Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF
   those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like
   /common/topic are written as common.topic.

   The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID
   (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex.
   common.topic) for schema.

   The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or
   a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign
   key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up
   keys by namespace.

   The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a
   human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies.
   It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric
   values.

   Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple
   fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

Freebase Deleted Triples

   We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase
   over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future,
   we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted
   triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so,
   and are only providing this one-time dump.

   The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb
   uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files
   (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just
   easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

   Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data
   release possible.
     * Total triples: 63 million
     * Updated: June 9, 2013
     * Data Format: CSV
     * License: CC-BY

   2 GB gzip
   8 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The
   object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as
   any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the
   other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can
   still be parsed unambiguously.

   The columns in the dataset are defined as:
     * creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * creator
     * deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * deletor
     * subject (MID)
     * predicate (MID)
     * object (MID/Literal)

   The Google Hosted Libraries is a stable, reliable, high-speed, globally
   available content distribution network for the most popular,
   open-source JavaScript libraries.

   Google works directly with the key stakeholders for each library effort
   and accepts the latest versions as they are released.

Libraries

   To load a hosted library, copy and paste the HTML snippet for that
   library (shown below) in your web page. For instance, to load jQuery,
   embed the <script
   src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js">
   </script> snippet in your web page.

   We recommend that you load libraries from the CDN via HTTPS, even if
   your own website only uses HTTP. Nowadays, performance is fast, and
   caching works just the same. The CDN's files are served with CORS and
   Timing-Allow headers and allowed to be cached for 1 year.

Troubleshooting

   Seeing an outdated version? Make sure you're not using the "automatic
   version" links, like /jqueryui/1/..., but instead use URLs referring to
   exact versions. Due to concerns over caching and lack of compatibility
   between even minor versions, we have deprecated and stopped updating
   the automatic version aliases some time ago, so they will forever refer
   to an old version (in order to not break existing sites that still use
   them).

   If you encounter problems:
     * Look for typos. Remember that JavaScript is a case-sensitive
       language.
     * Use a JavaScript debugger. In Chrome, use the Chrome DevTools. In
       Firefox, you can use the built-in Firefox DevTools. In IE, you can
       use the F12 developer tools.

Premium Plan Usage Rates and Limits

   This page is only for customers with the new version of the Google Maps
   APIs Premium Plan, which became available in January 2016.

   Have the Premium Plan or a previous license?
   To determine which license you have:
   > In the Google Cloud Support Portal, click Maps: Usage Report on the
   left.
   > Does the ID at the top of the report have the following format?
      gme-[company] & proj-[number] ([type])
   If yes, you have the Premium Plan.
   If no, you have a previous license (Maps APIs for Work or Maps API for
   Business).

Usage rates

   With the Google Maps APIs Premium Plan, your application consumes quota
   at different rates, depending on the APIs it requests.

Maps APIs Credits

   As a Premium Plan customer, you purchase quota—called Maps APIs
   Credits—for one or more years, based on an estimate of your
   application's annual usage. All of your application's requests for Maps
   APIs consume credits from the pool of credits you purchased. For
   example, if your application uses the Maps JavaScript API to display a
   map, it will consume credits for the Maps JavaScript API map loads. If
   your application consumes all of the credits in the pool, you can
   purchase additional credits, as needed.

Usage rates by API

   This type of API request... Consumes this many Maps APIs Credits...
   Maps JavaScript API map load 1
   Maps Static API, Street View Static API map load
   0.25
   Street View Static API metadata request
   0
   Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS) map load 1
   Places API server-side and client-side request; excluding Place
   Autocomplete 2
   Place Autocomplete (server-side and client-side) request 0.1
   Web service APIs (server-side) request: Geocoding API, Directions API,
   Distance Matrix API (per element), Elevation API, Geolocation API, Time
   Zone API, Roads API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)
   Client-side request: Geocoding API, Directions API, Distance Matrix API
   (per element), Elevation API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)

Map loads

   Web APIs:

   A single map load is charged when any of the following occur:
     * A web page or application displays a map using the Maps JavaScript
       API.
     * An application requests a single map image from the Maps Static
       API.

   Street View panoramas are charged separately from map loads:
     * A static Street View panorama is charged for each request to the
       Street View Static API to embed a static (non-interactive) Street
       View panorama.
     * A dynamic Street View panorama is charged for each instantiation of
       a panorama object in a Maps JavaScript API, Maps SDK for Android,
       Maps SDK for iOS application.

   After a web page or application loads a map, or a static map image, or
   a Street View panorama, any user interactions with it, such as panning,
   zooming, or switching map layers, do not generate additional map loads
   or affect usage limits.

   Mobile SDKs:

   A single map load is charged for each instantiation of a Google map or
   panorama object in an Android or iOS mobile application:
     * A GMSMapView or GMSPanoramaView object on iOS.
     * One of MapFragment, SupportMapFragment, MapView,
       StreetViewPanoramaFragment, SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment, or
       StreetViewPanoramaView on Android. A map load is counted each time
       the related onCreate() method is called.

   Once a mobile application loads a map or a Street View panorama, any
   user interactions with it do not generate additional map loads or
   affect usage limits.

Places API usage

   Requests for Place Search, Details, and Photos are charged separately
   from requests for Place Autocomplete. For example, in an Autocomplete
   widget, if a user enters an average of 5 characters (keystrokes) to
   find a place, and the user then selects that place to get details about
   it, your application consumes credits as follows:

   5 Place Autocomplete requests × 0.1 (0.5 credits) + Place Details
   (place selection) request (2 credits) = 2.5 credits

   The Places SDK for Android and the Places SDK for iOS are not available
   for sale and therefore not included with the Premium Plan.

Usage Limits

Total usage limits

   All of your application's requests for APIs consume Maps APIs Credits.
   Therefore, your application's total usage limit is determined by the
   number of credits you purchased. If you run out of Maps APIs Credits,
   your application's requests will continue to succeed, but your account
   may be subject to overage fees. In this case, you'll need to renew your
   Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license as soon as possible to avoid a
   suspension of your account. As you consume your quota, Google sends
   consumption notices via email based on the following increments: at 25%
   used (if used within the first 60 days), 50%, 75%, 85%, 100%, 110%, and
   130%.

Maps JavaScript API

   Requests for the Maps JavaScript API that generate map loads are
   applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you purchased for
   your Premium Plan.

Maps JavaScript API services (client side)

   The following are usage limits for client-side services that your
   application requests from the Maps JavaScript API:
   Service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. Rate limit applied per
   user session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. Rate limit applied per user
   session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Geocoding Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Rate limit applied per user session, regardless of how many
   users share the same project.**
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 100 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Note: requests
   using mode=transit or using the optional parameter departure_time when
   mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request. Rate limit
   applied per user session, regardless of how many users share the same
   project.**

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily
   free requests do not apply to Location Services licenses.

   ** When you first load the API, you are allocated an initial quota of
   requests. Once you use this quota, the API enforces rate limits on
   additional requests on a per-second basis. If too many requests are
   made within a certain time period, the API returns an OVER_QUERY_LIMIT
   response code. The per-session rate limit prevents the use of
   client-side services for batch requests, such as batch geocoding. For
   batch requests, use our web service APIs.

Google Maps Mobile SDKs

   Services Limits

   Maps SDK for Android
   Maps SDK for iOS

   Each map load is applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits
   purchased for your Premium Plan

Google Maps Image APIs

          Services        Limits
   Maps Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels, depending on the scale
   parameter, as explained below.
   Street View Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels.

   Note that Street View Static API metadata requests are free and do not
   consume any Maps APIs Credits.

   Your application can request Maps Static API images up to 2048 by 2048
   pixels. Because the scale value in a static map request affects the
   number of pixels returned, the maximum size value is different for each
   scale level:
   Scale Max Size   Returns
   1     2048x2048 2048x2048
   2     1024x1024 2048x2048
   4     512x512   2048x2048

   The Street View Static API does not support the scale parameter.

Web service APIs

   Web service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. 50** requests per second.
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. 50** requests per second.

   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 625 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Rate limit of 1,000 elements
   per second. Note: requests using the optional parameter departure_time
   when mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request.
   Geolocation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Time Zone Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Roads Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second. Each request may contain up to 100
   points.

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily

Data Dumps

   The Freebase API has been shut down. This page provides access to the
   last available data dump.

   Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They
   constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema
   that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The
   Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples

   This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.
     * Total triples: 1.9 billion
     * Updated: Weekly
     * Data Format: N-Triples RDF
     * License: CC-BY

   22 GB gzip
   250 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8
   text and compressed with Gzip.

ax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .

   If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more
   efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the
   data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .

   Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF
   those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like
   /common/topic are written as common.topic.

   The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID
   (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex.
   common.topic) for schema.

   The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or
   a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign
   key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up
   keys by namespace.

   The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a
   human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies.
   It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric
   values.

   Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple
   fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

Freebase Deleted Triples

   We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase
   over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future,
   we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted
   triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so,
   and are only providing this one-time dump.

   The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb
   uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files
   (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just
   easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

   Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data
   release possible.
     * Total triples: 63 million
     * Updated: June 9, 2013
     * Data Format: CSV
     * License: CC-BY

   2 GB gzip
   8 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The
   object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as
   any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the
   other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can
   still be parsed unambiguously.

   The columns in the dataset are defined as:
     * creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * creator
     * deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * deletor
     * subject (MID)
     * predicate (MID)
     * object (MID/Literal)

   The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28,
   2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common

   Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common
   Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

   The Google Hosted Libraries is a stable, reliable, high-speed, globally
   available content distribution network for the most popular,
   open-source JavaScript libraries.

   Google works directly with the key stakeholders for each library effort
   and accepts the latest versions as they are released.

Libraries

   To load a hosted library, copy and paste the HTML snippet for that
   library (shown below) in your web page. For instance, to load jQuery,
   embed the <script
   src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js">
   </script> snippet in your web page.

   We recommend that you load libraries from the CDN via HTTPS, even if
   your own website only uses HTTP. Nowadays, performance is fast, and
   caching works just the same. The CDN's files are served with CORS and
   Timing-Allow headers and allowed to be cached for 1 year.

Troubleshooting

   Seeing an outdated version? Make sure you're not using the "automatic
   version" links, like /jqueryui/1/..., but instead use URLs referring to
   exact versions. Due to concerns over caching and lack of compatibility
   between even minor versions, we have deprecated and stopped updating
   the automatic version aliases some time ago, so they will forever refer
   to an old version (in order to not break existing sites that still use
   them).

   If you encounter problems:
     * Look for typos. Remember that JavaScript is a case-sensitive
       language.
     * Use a JavaScript debugger. In Chrome, use the Chrome DevTools. In
       Firefox, you can use the built-in Firefox DevTools. In IE, you can
       use the F12 developer tools.

Error Messages

   This page describes the error messages that can be returned by the Maps
   JavaScript API. The Maps JavaScript API writes error and warning
   messages to the JavaScript console. Certain error conditions may also
   occur, which result in the display of a darkened watermarked map.

   If you are NOT the website owner, there are no steps you can take to
   fix any of these errors. However, you may want to notify the site owner
   if possible.

API Key and Billing Errors

   Attention customers in India

   As of September 10, 2018, usage for self-serve customers in India has
   been limited to $200/month. This situation is temporary. Please see the
   Maps FAQ for more details.

Troubleshooting

   Under certain circumstances, a darkened map, or 'negative' Street View
   image, watermarked with the text "for development purposes only", may
   be displayed. This behavior typically indicates issues with either an
   API key or billing. In order to use Google Maps Platform products,
   billing must be enabled on your account, and all requests must include
   a valid API key. The following flow will help you troubleshoot the
   issue.

Are you using an API key?

I'm not sure. How can I check if I am using an API key?

   An API key is passed as the key parameter in the URL that is used to
   load the Maps JavaScript API. Here are a few options to check if you
   are using an API key:
     * Use the Google Maps Platform API Checker Chrome extension. This
       allows you to determine if your website is properly implementing
       Google’s licensed Maps APIs.
     * If you are using a library or plugin to load the Maps JavaScript
       API, check the settings for that library and look for an API key
       option.
     * Check errors in your browser. If you see the following messages,
       you are not using your API key correctly:

     * Google Maps JavaScript API warning: NoApiKeys
     * Google Maps JavaScript API error: MissingKeyMapError

For web developers:

     * If you have access to the source code of your application, look for
       the <script> tag which is used to load the Maps JavaScript API.
       When loading the Maps JavaScript API, substitute YOUR_API_KEY in
       the code below with your API key.
  <script async defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initM
ap">
  </script>

     * Check the network traffic generated by your website in the browser.
       In Chrome, this can be viewed using the DevTools Network tab. Here
       you will see the network requests made by your website. Requests
       made using the Maps JavaScript API will be under the path
       maps/api/js. Here you can confirm if the requests are using the key
       parameter. It may be helpful to filter your network traffic by
       maps/api/js when viewing the Network tab.

No, I am not using an API key.

   Follow the steps here to Get, add, and restrict an API key .

Yes, I am using an API key.

   Great! Let’s move on and check if billing is enabled.

Is billing enabled on your account?

I'm not sure. How can I check if billing is enabled on my account?

   Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console and select the project
   under which your API key was created. To confirm the key is associated
   with the project:
    1. Go to the Credentials section, which can be accessed from the left
       side bar under APIs & Services > Credentials.
    2. Check that the API key you currently use on your website is listed.
       If that's not the case, switch to a different project, and check
       the credentials there.
    3. If you cannot locate the project for your API key, you may have
       lost access to this project. Ask others in your organization for
       help. If the original project cannot be located, you should:
         1. Create a new project. This can be done by selecting New
            Project from the projects list, or by selecting Create Project
            via the Resource Manager page.
         2. Create a new API key. This can be done on the Credentials
            page. Once there click Create credentials and then select API
            key.

   Once you have located your project in the Google Cloud Platform
   Console, check if billing is enabled by navigating to the Billing
   section in the left side menu.

No, billing has not been enabled on my account.

   You can enable billing on your account in the Google Cloud Platform
   Console.

Yes, billing has been enabled on my account.

   Great! Let’s make sure the provided billing method is valid.

Is the provided billing method no longer valid (for example an expired credit
card)?

   You can add, remove, or update a payment method in the Google Cloud
   Platform Console.

Is there an exceeded self-imposed daily limit on the API?

   If you have set a daily limit on any of your APIs, which is common to
   prevent unexpected increases, you can resolve this by increasing your
   daily limit.

   You can check your daily limits in the Google Cloud Platform Console by
   going to the APIs & Services Dashboard. Once there:
    1. Select a project if prompted.
    2. Select an API from the list, then click the Quotas tab.

Does your API key have an IP addresses restriction?

   API keys with an IP addresses restriction can only be used with web
   services that are intended for use from the server side (such as the
   Geocoding API and other Web Service APIs). Most of these web services
   have equivalent services within the Maps JavaScript API (for example,
   see the Geocoding Service). To use the Maps JavaScript API client side
   services, you will need to create a separate API key which can be
   secured with an HTTP referrers restriction (see Get, add, and restrict
   an API key ).

   For help on finding error messages, see the section on checking errors
   in your browser.

Maps JavaScript API Error Codes for Developers and Site Owners

   The following tables list the possible error codes returned by the Maps
   JavaScript API, with a description of the cause and how you can fix the
   problem. For help on finding the error messages, see the section on
   checking errors in your browser.

Map Loading Errors

   If you encounter an error while loading the Maps JavaScript API, please
   see the table below to find explanations for the error codes.
   Error Code Message Description
   NotLoadingAPIFromGoogleMapsError The Maps JavaScript API must be
   downloaded directly from Google's servers.

   The script element that loads the Maps JavaScript API is not being
   included correctly on your page. In order for the API to work
   correctly, it must be loaded directly from https://maps.googleapis.com.

   See Loading the Maps JavaScript API.
   TOSViolationMapError This website appears to violate the Google Maps
   API Terms of Service. The Google Maps API has been disabled for this
   website.

   Your application was blocked for non-compliance with the Google Maps
   Platform Terms of Service, following several email notifications. To
   appeal the block and have your implementation reviewed, please complete
   this form. You will receive a response via email within a few business
   days.

   Google Maps APIs Premium Plan credentials to resolve this error. See
   the guide to Premium Plan authentication.
   UnauthorizedURLForClientIdMapError This URL is not authorized to use
   the Google Maps Client ID provided.

   The Premium Plan or Maps APIs for Work client ID included in the script
   load is invalid, expired, or the current address loading the Maps
   JavaScript API has not been added to the list of authorized URLs.

   See Registering Authorized URLs.

Maps JavaScript API Error Codes

   If you find an error on Chrome JavaScript Console, Firefox Web Console
   or any other equivalent tools on your browsers, please see the table
   below to find explanations for the error codes.

   The Maps JavaScript API returns both errors and warnings. An error
   indicates a severe issue which occurred while loading the Maps
   JavaScript API. Your page cannot load the API correctly, and the API
   will not work on that page. A warning is a supplemental message about
   the loading of the Maps JavaScript API. The warning describes the
   possible reasons for an error, or suggests potential issues in your
   code that loads the Maps JavaScript API. If you receive only warnings
   without any errors, the API will work correctly on that page. However,
   we recommend that you fix these potential issues as well.
   Developer Error Code Type Description
   ApiNotActivatedMapError Error

   The Maps JavaScript API is not activated on your API project. You may
   need to enable the Maps JavaScript API under APIs in the Google Cloud

   SignedInNotSupported Warning

   The signed_in parameter has been deprecated and is not supported on the
   version of the Maps JavaScript API you are using. This won't prevent
   the Maps JavaScript API from working, but the behavior of your
   application may change, if you rely on signed-in features.

   Please review your application and see Signed-in Maps | Google Maps
   JavaScript API for details about the deprecation.
   UrlAuthenticationCommonError Error

   An error has occurred that doesn't fit into the other categories on
   this page. This could be caused by a temporary problem. Please retry
   the request after a short delay. If that doesn't solve the problem,
   please review the developer's guide to make sure the request has the
   proper format.

Checking Errors in Your Browser

   The Maps JavaScript API writes error messages to window.console. This
   section explains how you can check the window.console output in Google
   Chrome. If you are using any other browsers, please check the developer
   documentation for your browser. For your reference, this is a list of
   tools to check window.console output in some other browsers.
     * Console for Internet Explorer.
     * Web Console for Firefox.
     * Remote debugging for Android.
     * Web Inspector for iOS.

   In Chrome, you can use the JavaScript Console to check window.console
   output as follows.
    1. To open the Developer Tools, select the menu icon > More Tools >
       Developer Tools.
    2. To open the JavaScript Console, press the ESC key on your keyboard.
       The ESC key will toggle the JavaScript Console. If you close the
       console, press the ESC key again to open it.

   If any errors or warnings occurred when loading the Maps JavaScript
   API, they appear as one or more lines in the console. An error or
   warning message has the following format:

   Google Maps API error: [ERROR CODE] [Link to API document]
   or
   Google Maps API warning: [ERROR CODE] [Link to API document]

   You can check the error codes table above to find the error code in the
   error message. You can also find the details about the error message in
   the API document linked from the message.

   Note: You can listen for authentication errors programmatically.

Handling unsupported browsers

   Ensure that the version of the browser you are using is currently
   supported by the Maps JavaScript API.
     * If you're using Internet Explorer (IE), upgrade to the latest IE
       version. In view of the end of support for older IE versions, you
       could also consider using any of the alternative browsers supported
       by the Maps JavaScript API.
     * If you're developing a native Windows application that runs in a
       webview, using an Internet Explorer version that's supported by the
       Maps JavaScript API, it's likely that your browser is reverting to
       a mode that uses Internet Explorer 7 by default. You can override
       this default behavior in the following ways:

     * Specify a legacy document mode by using the IE X-UA-Compatible meta
       header (recommended fix).
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="IE=edge">
     * Update the registry to use application-specific
       FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION registry keys.
