       Enjoy a proper, full day out. Rain or shine, you wont run out of
       things to see when exploring our 26 acres.
       Whatever your age or those that youll be bringing along, nothing is
       out of bounds. Unbelievable as it seems, an entire Black Country
       village has been created; brick-by-original-brick.
