Plant-Based Food Options Are Sprouting Growth for Retailers

   CPG, FMCG & Retail | 06-13-2018

   From a consumption perspective, many would argue that there’s never
   been a better time to be a shopper. That’s because there’s something
   for everyone and every taste. And when it comes to nutrition, 37% of
   Americans say they’re following a specific diet this year, which is up
   from 35% last year and 29% in 2016. And with consumers narrowing their
   foci, brands and retailers need to stay tuned in—or risk missing out.

   Amid the various nutrition programs on the market today, plant-based
   diets are gaining particular prominence. Notably, a Nielsen Homescan
   survey last year found that 39% of Americans are actively trying to eat
   more plant-based foods. To meet their goals, however, many shoppers
   aren’t looking to traditional plant-based staples like tofu, brown rice
   and granola. In fact, sales of traditional plant-based options were
   down 1.3% in the year ended April 7, 2018.

   That’s not to say that growth in plant options is absent, however.
   Within the plant-based food space, innovation is booming, and an array
   of plant-based alternatives are posting significant sales growth.

   In looking across the U.S., 6% of Americans say they follow a strictly
   vegetarian lifestyle, while 3% follow a strictly vegan lifestyle.
   Regardless of motivations, the number of consumers adopting vegetarian
   or vegan lifestyles is increasing, predominantly among young and
   diverse consumer groups. In looking across demographic groups, ethnic
   and young consumers express higher intentions to eat more plant-based
   foods:
     * African Americans are 48% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Asian Americans are 47% more likely than the average U.S. consumer
       to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Hispanic consumers are 46% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Caucasian Millennials are 47% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.

   From a total store perspective, plant-based food options are no small
   potatoes. As of 2017, 19.5% of food and beverage dollars came from
   products that met a plant-based diet. And as a result of consumer
   interest, vegan (which excludes produce) and produce sales growth is
   outpacing total food and beverage sales.

   In addition, vegan and produce options increased their dollar share by
   nearly 2% between 2014 and 2017.

   Vegetarian and vegan offerings aren’t limited to solid foods, however,
   as most of us are well aware of the rise in dairy alternatives,
   particularly milk substitutes. And from a consumption perspective,
   Americans are going nuts for almond milk, which has posted a three-year
   combined annual growth rate of 8.2%.

   Whether it be due to health, ethics or sustainability, the proportion
   of U.S. consumers that adhere to a vegetarian or vegan diet is growing.
   And that presents notable opportunity for brands and retailers looking
   for ways to capitalize on specific needs and desires among consumers
   opting for plant-based food and beverage options, particularly in cases
   where no or few options currently exist.

Digital Measurement Privacy Statement

   Nielsen uses its proprietary digital measurement products to measure
   and analyze how consumers engage with media across online, mobile and
   emerging technologies, and Nielsen offers insights into consumer
   behavior.

   In 2015, Nielsen acquired eXelate, a digital advertising technology
   company that is now part of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud suite of
   services.

   Nielsen Total Audience and Nielsen Marketing Cloud use different
   solutions from one another. Nielsen does share a limited amount of
   non-identifiable or aggregated data between these two separate Nielsen
   product lines to help them each function better and more efficiently,
   but audience measurement data is not directly used to help place online
   ads. For more information about how the Nielsen Marketing Cloud
   collects and uses data, please read the Nielsen Marketing Cloud Privacy
   Statement.

How We Collect Data for Audience Measurement

   Nielsen works with various companies, including data providers,
   advertisers and publishers, to measure the effectiveness and reach of
   content viewed or listened to on the internet and radio, no matter what
   kind of device people use to consume it. For example, we help
   advertisers better understand campaign performances across TV, radio,
   computer and mobile audiences.

   Here’s how it works: Participating companies include proprietary
   Nielsen measurement software in their content on their chosen sites,
   ads, apps and video players. Here, the word “content” refers to audio,
   video, advertisements and any other media users might encounter or
   engage with. Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software embedded in the
   content uses tags (including cookies, pixel tags, and our software
   contained in mobile applications) or watermarks to gather information
   that help us understand what content users are exposed to and interact
   with, which advertising campaigns are effective, and the aggregated
   demographic composition of a website’s or application’s visitors or
   viewers of digital content. For example, a sample audience measurement
   report might say “this ad campaign was viewed by 70,000 females between
   the ages 24-30 in the U.S., Pacific Northwest region.”

   We also work with third-party service providers to obtain pseudonymous
   and/or aggregated data, which we to our measurements. “Pseudonymous
   data” means individual-level data from which the underlying individuals
   cannot reasonably be identified. Types of pseudonymous data include
   information associated with, for example, a cookie, advertising or
   device identifier, or other persistent unique identifier. “Aggregated
   data” means a set of data about a group or segment of individuals that
   prevents specific individuals from within the group from being
   identified.

   Sometimes our mobile measurement software is embedded in Adobe’s
   Primetime, a “TV Everywhere” platform that enables consumers to watch
   live, linear and on-demand programming on different devices. Learn more
   about Adobe Primetime and read the privacy statement for Adobe’s
   analytics products.

What Data Do We Collect?

   We do not identify, or attempt to identify, the individuals we collect
   content measurement data from.

   Nielsen’s proprietary digital measurement software may collect data
   about the content that was viewed (e.g., which ad campaign, or which
   program episode), where the content was viewed (e.g., on which website
   or in which app), and general information about the device on which the
   content was viewed (e.g., tablet or smartphone, advertising identifier,
   IP address, operating system). Data from one of our lines of services
   is then matched with data from other companies that recognize their own
   users or that collect data about consumers generally. These other
   companies provide Nielsen with aggregated or pseudonymous audience
   statistics. We do not tell these third parties what content their users
   have viewed, and Nielsen never learns the identities of the other
   companies’ users.

   Our Nielsen Digital Brand Effect services randomly present short
   surveys to users who may or may not have been exposed to our clients’
   content. Responses are voluntary. If a viewer responds to a survey
   question, the response is stored in a database. The surveys do not ask
   for or collect any directly identifiable data.

How Do We Use This Data?

   We use this data to create a variety of insights, reports and analyses,
   including the composition of the audience that viewed certain content,
   or about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

   Nielsen may also enhance or calibrate the data collected with other
   online and offline data sources and research tools, including Nielsen
   panelist viewing data (excluding individually identifying details).
   Other data sources may include social media or ecommerce sites. These
   additional sources allow us to perform more robust research and
   analyses concerning Internet audience demographics, preferences, and
   use.

   We include only non-identifiable or aggregated data in our insights,
   reports and analyses.

With Whom Do We Share Data?

   We employ or work with other companies or individuals to perform
   certain functions on our behalf. These service providers are granted
   access to the data needed to perform their functions, but are
   prohibited from using our data for any other purpose. In addition, we
   may release data to third parties when disclosure is required by law or
   as needed to exercise or preserve our legal rights, or to take action
   regarding potentially illegal activities, as well as in the event of a
   sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our
   business or assets (in which case we will take reasonable steps to
   ensure that the data is protected as described in this Statement). We
   may also share pseudonymous data to facilitate the financing,
   securitization, insuring, or other necessary business activities.

Data Retention and Security

   Nielsen uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative
   measures to protect the security and confidentiality of data within our
   control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data
   storage system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

   We store data for as long as needed for our research and analyses
   purposes as described in this Statement and in accordance with law. We
   may store data in the U.S. or we may transfer them to another country.
   Wherever we hold data, we will apply the terms of this Statement and
   any applicable law.

Choices

   Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to
   contribute to our research and insights. If you are not currently a
   Nielsen panelist and do not wish to participate in Nielsen’s digital
   measurement research, you may opt out on browsers by clicking here.

   With browsers, Nielsen uses both regular HTTP cookies and HTML5 local
   storage. We keep in HTML5 local storage only a copy of the unique
   cookie ID assigned to our HTTP cookie that is placed on your computer.
   When you opt out, our opt-out mechanism replaces the unique HTTP cookie
   with an “OPT_OUT” cookie and clears out the information Nielsen has
   placed in HTML5 local storage. If you delete all of your regular
   cookies (which would include your Nielsen HTTP “OPT_OUT” cookie), you
   will have to opt out again. Please note that because this is a
   browser-level opt out, if you use more than one browser, you will need
   to opt out in each. Safari users should be aware that recent changes to
   Safari will cause the browser to automatically discard the Nielsen
   opt-out cookie that prevents us from measuring you, effectively opting
   you back in.  Using a different browser will enable you to opt out and
   keep that opt out in effect. If you change your mind and want to
   participate in Nielsen’s digital measurement research, you may opt back
   in.

   (Attention Safari users—recent changes to Safari will cause the browser
   to automatically discard the Nielsen opt-out cookie that prevents us
   from measuring you, effectively opting you back in.)

   In the mobile app environment, we require each application that
   contains active Nielsen measurement software to disclose that Nielsen
   measurement is included in that app, and provide access to a Nielsen
   opt out. Please note that some of the older apps that contain Nielsen’s
   software are able to provide only an app-level and device-specific opt
   out. So, if you have more than one older mobile app that contains our
   software, or if you have the same older app on more than one mobile
   device, you will need to opt out in each app on each device. In newer
   apps, Nielsen offers a device-level opt-out. You need only to activate
   the “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads
   Personalization” (for Android devices) option in your device’s
   settings. If you have the same newer app on more than one mobile
   device, you will need to change the settings on each device. The app’s
   privacy notice should make clear which type of opt-out is available for
   Nielsen’s measurement software.

Changes to This Privacy Statement

   Nielsen reserves the right to update and make changes to this privacy
   Statement. We will provide a description of changes since the last
   update in the “Recent Changes to this Privacy Statement” section.

Plant-Based Food Options Are Sprouting Growth for Retailers

   CPG, FMCG & Retail | 06-13-2018

   From a consumption perspective, many would argue that there’s never
   been a better time to be a shopper. That’s because there’s something
   for everyone and every taste. And when it comes to nutrition, 37% of
   Americans say they’re following a specific diet this year, which is up
   from 35% last year and 29% in 2016. And with consumers narrowing their
   foci, brands and retailers need to stay tuned in—or risk missing out.

   Amid the various nutrition programs on the market today, plant-based
   diets are gaining particular prominence. Notably, a Nielsen Homescan
   survey last year found that 39% of Americans are actively trying to eat
   more plant-based foods. To meet their goals, however, many shoppers
   aren’t looking to traditional plant-based staples like tofu, brown rice
   and granola. In fact, sales of traditional plant-based options were
   down 1.3% in the year ended April 7, 2018.

   That’s not to say that growth in plant options is absent, however.
   Within the plant-based food space, innovation is booming, and an array
   of plant-based alternatives are posting significant sales growth.

   In looking across the U.S., 6% of Americans say they follow a strictly
   vegetarian lifestyle, while 3% follow a strictly vegan lifestyle.
   Regardless of motivations, the number of consumers adopting vegetarian
   or vegan lifestyles is increasing, predominantly among young and
   diverse consumer groups. In looking across demographic groups, ethnic
   and young consumers express higher intentions to eat more plant-based
   foods:
     * African Americans are 48% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Asian Americans are 47% more likely than the average U.S. consumer
       to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Hispanic consumers are 46% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Caucasian Millennials are 47% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.

   From a total store perspective, plant-based food options are no small
   potatoes. As of 2017, 19.5% of food and beverage dollars came from
   products that met a plant-based diet. And as a result of consumer
   interest, vegan (which excludes produce) and produce sales growth is
   outpacing total food and beverage sales.

   In addition, vegan and produce options increased their dollar share by
   nearly 2% between 2014 and 2017.

   Vegetarian and vegan offerings aren’t limited to solid foods, however,
   as most of us are well aware of the rise in dairy alternatives,
   particularly milk substitutes. And from a consumption perspective,
   Americans are going nuts for almond milk, which has posted a three-year
   combined annual growth rate of 8.2%.

   Whether it be due to health, ethics or sustainability, the proportion
   of U.S. consumers that adhere to a vegetarian or vegan diet is growing.
   And that presents notable opportunity for brands and retailers looking
   for ways to capitalize on specific needs and desires among consumers
   opting for plant-based food and beverage options, particularly in cases
   where no or few options currently exist.

Digital Measurement Privacy Statement

   Nielsen uses its proprietary digital measurement products to measure
   and analyze how consumers engage with media across online, mobile and
   emerging technologies, and Nielsen offers insights into consumer
   behavior.

   In 2015, Nielsen acquired eXelate, a digital advertising technology
   company that is now part of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud suite of
   services.

   Nielsen Total Audience and Nielsen Marketing Cloud use different
   solutions from one another. Nielsen does share a limited amount of
   non-identifiable or aggregated data between these two separate Nielsen
   product lines to help them each function better and more efficiently,
   but audience measurement data is not directly used to help place online
   ads. For more information about how the Nielsen Marketing Cloud
   collects and uses data, please read the Nielsen Marketing Cloud Privacy
   Statement.

How We Collect Data for Audience Measurement

   Nielsen works with various companies, including data providers,
   advertisers and publishers, to measure the effectiveness and reach of
   content viewed or listened to on the internet and radio, no matter what
   kind of device people use to consume it. For example, we help
   advertisers better understand campaign performances across TV, radio,
   computer and mobile audiences.

   Here’s how it works: Participating companies include proprietary
   Nielsen measurement software in their content on their chosen sites,
   ads, apps and video players. Here, the word “content” refers to audio,
   video, advertisements and any other media users might encounter or
   engage with. Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software embedded in the
   content uses tags (including cookies, pixel tags, and our software
   contained in mobile applications) or watermarks to gather information
   that help us understand what content users are exposed to and interact
   with, which advertising campaigns are effective, and the aggregated
   demographic composition of a website’s or application’s visitors or
   viewers of digital content. For example, a sample audience measurement
   report might say “this ad campaign was viewed by 70,000 females between
   the ages 24-30 in the U.S., Pacific Northwest region.”

   We also work with third-party service providers to obtain pseudonymous
   and/or aggregated data, which we to our measurements. “Pseudonymous
   data” means individual-level data from which the underlying individuals
   cannot reasonably be identified. Types of pseudonymous data include
   information associated with, for example, a cookie, advertising or
   device identifier, or other persistent unique identifier. “Aggregated
   data” means a set of data about a group or segment of individuals that
   prevents specific individuals from within the group from being
   identified.

   Sometimes our mobile measurement software is embedded in Adobe’s
   Primetime, a “TV Everywhere” platform that enables consumers to watch
   live, linear and on-demand programming on different devices. Learn more
   about Adobe Primetime and read the privacy statement for Adobe’s
   analytics products.

What Data Do We Collect?

   We do not identify, or attempt to identify, the individuals we collect
   content measurement data from.

   Nielsen’s proprietary digital measurement software may collect data
   about the content that was viewed (e.g., which ad campaign, or which
   program episode), where the content was viewed (e.g., on which website
   or in which app), and general information about the device on which the
   content was viewed (e.g., tablet or smartphone, advertising identifier,
   IP address, operating system). Data from one of our lines of services
   is then matched with data from other companies that recognize their own
   users or that collect data about consumers generally. These other
   companies provide Nielsen with aggregated or pseudonymous audience
   statistics. We do not tell these third parties what content their users
   have viewed, and Nielsen never learns the identities of the other
   companies’ users.

   Our Nielsen Digital Brand Effect services randomly present short
   surveys to users who may or may not have been exposed to our clients’
   content. Responses are voluntary. If a viewer responds to a survey
   question, the response is stored in a database. The surveys do not ask
   for or collect any directly identifiable data.

How Do We Use This Data?

   We use this data to create a variety of insights, reports and analyses,
   including the composition of the audience that viewed certain content,
   or about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

   Nielsen may also enhance or calibrate the data collected with other
   online and offline data sources and research tools, including Nielsen
   panelist viewing data (excluding individually identifying details).
   Other data sources may include social media or ecommerce sites. These
   additional sources allow us to perform more robust research and
   analyses concerning Internet audience demographics, preferences, and
   use.

   We include only non-identifiable or aggregated data in our insights,
   reports and analyses.

With Whom Do We Share Data?

   We employ or work with other companies or individuals to perform
   certain functions on our behalf. These service providers are granted
   access to the data needed to perform their functions, but are
   prohibited from using our data for any other purpose. In addition, we
   may release data to third parties when disclosure is required by law or
   as needed to exercise or preserve our legal rights, or to take action
   regarding potentially illegal activities, as well as in the event of a
   sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our
   business or assets (in which case we will take reasonable steps to
   ensure that the data is protected as described in this Statement). We
   may also share pseudonymous data to facilitate the financing,
   securitization, insuring, or other necessary business activities.

Data Retention and Security

   Nielsen uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative
   measures to protect the security and confidentiality of data within our
   control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data
   storage system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

   We store data for as long as needed for our research and analyses
   purposes as described in this Statement and in accordance with law. We
   may store data in the U.S. or we may transfer them to another country.
   Wherever we hold data, we will apply the terms of this Statement and
   any applicable law.

Choices

   Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to
   contribute to our research and insights. If you are not currently a
   Nielsen panelist and do not wish to participate in Nielsen’s digital
   measurement research, you may opt out on browsers by clicking here.

   With browsers, Nielsen uses both regular HTTP cookies and HTML5 local
   storage. We keep in HTML5 local storage only a copy of the unique
   cookie ID assigned to our HTTP cookie that is placed on your computer.
   When you opt out, our opt-out mechanism replaces the unique HTTP cookie
   with an “OPT_OUT” cookie and clears out the information Nielsen has
   placed in HTML5 local storage. If you delete all of your regular
   cookies (which would include your Nielsen HTTP “OPT_OUT” cookie), you
   will have to opt out again. Please note that because this is a
   browser-level opt out, if you use more than one browser, you will need
   to opt out in each. Safari users should be aware that recent changes to
   Safari will cause the browser to automatically discard the Nielsen
   opt-out cookie that prevents us from measuring you, effectively opting
   you back in.  Using a different browser will enable you to opt out and
   keep that opt out in effect. If you change your mind and want to
   participate in Nielsen’s digital measurement research, you may opt back
   in.

   (Attention Safari users—recent changes to Safari will cause the browser
   to automatically discard the Nielsen opt-out cookie that prevents us
   from measuring you, effectively opting you back in.)

   In the mobile app environment, we require each application that
   contains active Nielsen measurement software to disclose that Nielsen
   measurement is included in that app, and provide access to a Nielsen
   opt out. Please note that some of the older apps that contain Nielsen’s
   software are able to provide only an app-level and device-specific opt
   out. So, if you have more than one older mobile app that contains our
   software, or if you have the same older app on more than one mobile
   device, you will need to opt out in each app on each device. In newer
   apps, Nielsen offers a device-level opt-out. You need only to activate
   the “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads
   Personalization” (for Android devices) option in your device’s
   settings. If you have the same newer app on more than one mobile
   device, you will need to change the settings on each device. The app’s
   privacy notice should make clear which type of opt-out is available for
   Nielsen’s measurement software.

Changes to This Privacy Statement

   Nielsen reserves the right to update and make changes to this privacy
   Statement. We will provide a description of changes since the last
   update in the “Recent Changes to this Privacy Statement” section.

Plant-Based Food Options Are Sprouting Growth for Retailers

   CPG, FMCG & Retail | 06-13-2018

   From a consumption perspective, many would argue that there’s never
   been a better time to be a shopper. That’s because there’s something
   for everyone and every taste. And when it comes to nutrition, 37% of
   Americans say they’re following a specific diet this year, which is up
   from 35% last year and 29% in 2016. And with consumers narrowing their
   foci, brands and retailers need to stay tuned in—or risk missing out.

   Amid the various nutrition programs on the market today, plant-based
   diets are gaining particular prominence. Notably, a Nielsen Homescan
   survey last year found that 39% of Americans are actively trying to eat
   more plant-based foods. To meet their goals, however, many shoppers
   aren’t looking to traditional plant-based staples like tofu, brown rice
   and granola. In fact, sales of traditional plant-based options were
   down 1.3% in the year ended April 7, 2018.

   That’s not to say that growth in plant options is absent, however.
   Within the plant-based food space, innovation is booming, and an array
   of plant-based alternatives are posting significant sales growth.

   In looking across the U.S., 6% of Americans say they follow a strictly
   vegetarian lifestyle, while 3% follow a strictly vegan lifestyle.
   Regardless of motivations, the number of consumers adopting vegetarian
   or vegan lifestyles is increasing, predominantly among young and
   diverse consumer groups. In looking across demographic groups, ethnic
   and young consumers express higher intentions to eat more plant-based
   foods:
     * African Americans are 48% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Asian Americans are 47% more likely than the average U.S. consumer
       to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Hispanic consumers are 46% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Caucasian Millennials are 47% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.

   From a total store perspective, plant-based food options are no small
   potatoes. As of 2017, 19.5% of food and beverage dollars came from
   products that met a plant-based diet. And as a result of consumer
   interest, vegan (which excludes produce) and produce sales growth is
   outpacing total food and beverage sales.

   In addition, vegan and produce options increased their dollar share by
   nearly 2% between 2014 and 2017.

   Vegetarian and vegan offerings aren’t limited to solid foods, however,
   as most of us are well aware of the rise in dairy alternatives,
   particularly milk substitutes. And from a consumption perspective,
   Americans are going nuts for almond milk, which has posted a three-year
   combined annual growth rate of 8.2%.

   Whether it be due to health, ethics or sustainability, the proportion
   of U.S. consumers that adhere to a vegetarian or vegan diet is growing.
   And that presents notable opportunity for brands and retailers looking
   for ways to capitalize on specific needs and desires among consumers
   opting for plant-based food and beverage options, particularly in cases
   where no or few options currently exist.

Plant-Based Food Options Are Sprouting Growth for Retailers

   CPG, FMCG & Retail | 06-13-2018

   From a consumption perspective, many would argue that there’s never
   been a better time to be a shopper. That’s because there’s something
   for everyone and every taste. And when it comes to nutrition, 37% of
   Americans say they’re following a specific diet this year, which is up
   from 35% last year and 29% in 2016. And with consumers narrowing their
   foci, brands and retailers need to stay tuned in—or risk missing out.

   Amid the various nutrition programs on the market today, plant-based
   diets are gaining particular prominence. Notably, a Nielsen Homescan
   survey last year found that 39% of Americans are actively trying to eat
   more plant-based foods. To meet their goals, however, many shoppers
   aren’t looking to traditional plant-based staples like tofu, brown rice
   and granola. In fact, sales of traditional plant-based options were
   down 1.3% in the year ended April 7, 2018.

   That’s not to say that growth in plant options is absent, however.
   Within the plant-based food space, innovation is booming, and an array
   of plant-based alternatives are posting significant sales growth.

   In looking across the U.S., 6% of Americans say they follow a strictly
   vegetarian lifestyle, while 3% follow a strictly vegan lifestyle.
   Regardless of motivations, the number of consumers adopting vegetarian
   or vegan lifestyles is increasing, predominantly among young and
   diverse consumer groups. In looking across demographic groups, ethnic
   and young consumers express higher intentions to eat more plant-based
   foods:
     * African Americans are 48% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Asian Americans are 47% more likely than the average U.S. consumer
       to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Hispanic consumers are 46% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Caucasian Millennials are 47% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.

   From a total store perspective, plant-based food options are no small
   potatoes. As of 2017, 19.5% of food and beverage dollars came from
   products that met a plant-based diet. And as a result of consumer
   interest, vegan (which excludes produce) and produce sales growth is
   outpacing total food and beverage sales.

   In addition, vegan and produce options increased their dollar share by
   nearly 2% between 2014 and 2017.

   Vegetarian and vegan offerings aren’t limited to solid foods, however,
   as most of us are well aware of the rise in dairy alternatives,
   particularly milk substitutes. And from a consumption perspective,
   Americans are going nuts for almond milk, which has posted a three-year
   combined annual growth rate of 8.2%.

   Whether it be due to health, ethics or sustainability, the proportion
   of U.S. consumers that adhere to a vegetarian or vegan diet is growing.
   And that presents notable opportunity for brands and retailers looking
   for ways to capitalize on specific needs and desires among consumers
   opting for plant-based food and beverage options, particularly in cases
   where no or few options currently exist.
