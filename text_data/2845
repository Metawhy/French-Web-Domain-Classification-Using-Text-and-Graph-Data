What is computational linguistics?

   Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a
   computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in
   providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic
   phenomena. These models may be "knowledge-based" ("hand-crafted") or
   "data-driven" ("statistical" or "empirical"). Work in computational
   linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in
   that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a
   particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other
   cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants
   to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system.
   Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many
   working systems today, including speech recognition systems,
   text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web
   search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name
   just a few.

   Popular computational linguistics textbooks include:
     * Christopher Manning and Hinrich Schütze (1999) Foundations of
       Statistical Natural Language Processing, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
       USA. MIT Press.
       Also see the book's supplemental materials website at Stanford.

Fixing Translation Divergences in Parallel Corpora for Neural MT

   MinhQuang Pham, Josep Crego, Jean Senellart, François Yvon
     __________________________________________________________________

Abstract

   Corpus-based approaches to machine translation rely on the availability
   of clean parallel corpora. Such resources are scarce, and because of
   the automatic processes involved in their preparation, they are often
   noisy. This paper describes an unsupervised method for detecting
   translation divergences in parallel sentences. We rely on a neural
   network that computes cross-lingual sentence similarity scores, which
   are then used to effectively filter out divergent translations.
   Furthermore, similarity scores predicted by the network are used to
   identify and fix some partial divergences, yielding additional parallel
   segments. We evaluate these methods for English-French and
   English-German machine translation tasks, and show that using
   filtered/corrected corpora actually improves MT performance.

Neural Network Architectures for Arabic Dialect Identification

   Elise Michon, Minh Quang Pham, Josep Crego, Jean Senellart
     __________________________________________________________________

Abstract

   SYSTRAN competes this year for the first time to the DSL shared task,
   in the Arabic Dialect Identification subtask. We participate by
   training several Neural Network models showing that we can obtain
   competitive results despite the limited amount of training data
   available for learning. We report our experiments and detail the
   network architecture and parameters of our 3 runs: our best performing
   system consists in a Multi-Input CNN that learns separate embeddings
   for lexical, phonetic and acoustic input features (F1: 0.5289); we also
   built a CNN-biLSTM network aimed at capturing both spatial and
   sequential features directly from speech spectrograms (F1: 0.3894 at
   submission time, F1: 0.4235 with later found parameters); and finally a
   system relying on binary CNN-biLSTMs (F1: 0.4339).

OpenNMT System Description for WNMT 2018: 800 words/sec on a single-core CPU

     __________________________________________________________________

Abstract

   We present a system description of the OpenNMT Neural Machine
   Translation entry for the WNMT 2018 evaluation. In this work, we
   developed a heavily optimized NMT inference model targeting a
   high-performance CPU system. The final system uses a combination of
   four techniques, all of them lead to significant speed-ups in
   combination: (a) sequence distillation, (b) architecture modifications,
   (c) precomputation, particularly of vocabulary, and (d) CPU targeted
   quantization. This work achieves the fastest performance of the shared
   task, and led to the development of new features that have been
   integrated to OpenNMT and available to the community.

What is computational linguistics?

   Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a
   computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in
   providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic
   phenomena. These models may be "knowledge-based" ("hand-crafted") or
   "data-driven" ("statistical" or "empirical"). Work in computational
   linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in
   that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a
   particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other
   cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants
   to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system.
   Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many
   working systems today, including speech recognition systems,
   text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web
   search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name
   just a few.

   Popular computational linguistics textbooks include:
     * Christopher Manning and Hinrich Schütze (1999) Foundations of
       Statistical Natural Language Processing, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
       USA. MIT Press.
       Also see the book's supplemental materials website at Stanford.

     * Daniel Jurafsky and James Martin (2008) An Introduction to Natural
       Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech
       Recognition, Second Edition. Prentice Hall.
