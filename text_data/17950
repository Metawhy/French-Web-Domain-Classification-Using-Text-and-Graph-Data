Hey there gorgeous woman!

   Thank you so much for dropping in to my website.  I am honoured and
   humbled that you have taken the time to check me out!

   Let me formally introduce myself: my name is Jane Curnow, I am a
   mentor, coach, author, speaker, fitness model & bodybuilder.

   I suffered debilitating depression for 25 years and cured myself by
   accident (!) in my late 40s.  I celebrated my 50th birthday on stage as
   my declaration to the world that I am FULLY recovered!

   As a result of my years of heartache, self-loathing and now recovery I
   am totally obsessed & passionate about health, wellness & empowering
   women to feel as AMAZING as I do!

Goodbye depression, anxiety, overwhelm, eating disorders.  HELLO vitality,
energy, passion & purpose!

   My mission in life is now to support you achieve what I have!  To
   transform your life as I have transformed my own!

   It breaks my heart to see so many women suffer as I used to.

   It would be my honour and deepest pleasure to be by your side on your
   journey of transformation.  To share all that I have learned and
   incorporated into my own life to achieve INCREDIBLE results!

   It is not rocket science but we are not taught this in school.  It is
   not your fault you don't know! I didn't know either! And now I do and I
   will teach you!
   ARE YOU READY? Click here >>

I believe it is our birthright to feel empowered and passionate about life!

I have a dream...  a vision for all women.

   A world that fosters and celebrates our uniqueness.

   Where we all:

   ♥ Eat with love not fear

   ♥ Feel confident & comfortable in our own skin

   ♥ Know what it feels like to own a vital, energetic, healthy body

   ♥ Feel worthy and deserving of anything our hearts desire

   ♥ Feel deeply connected to our inner voice & intuition

   ♥ Worship our bodies as the sacred temple it is

   ♥ Know what it feels like to experience happiness from the inside

   ♥ Have the ability to be kind & loving without projecting insecurities
   or judgement onto others

   ♥ Know that self-care & kindness is the path to self-acceptance

   ♥ Know that self-love & compassion is the path to obtaining & keeping
   our dream body

   ♥ Look in the mirror and feel pride for the incredible woman we all are

   ♥ Feel safe to embrace and be our beautiful authentic self

   ♥ Live life with passion and purpose

   ♥ Lovingly speak our truth and SHINE in all our fabulousness

    Why do too many of us not feel like this??!!

     * Do you feel constant pressure to be slim, youthful and beautiful?
     * Do you feel overwhelmed & anxious?
     * Do you feel stressed out & unable to cope?
     * Do you feel guilty for struggling all the time?
     * Do you count calories with no regard to nutritional value?
     * Do you think you will finally be happy with yourself and your life
       once you achieve your dream body?
     * Do you think you will finally be happy with your life once you get
       the man, house, kids, job, money etc. etc.?
     * Are you scared you will lose your man or he will cheat if you don't
       get skinny?
     * Do you avoid looking at yourself in the mirror? Naked..?
     * Do you feel fat, tired, unhealthy, stressed, blah?
     * Do you feel teary, anxious, worried and don't really know why?
     * When was the last time you felt sexy, beautiful, confident,
       empowered and freakin awesome about yourself?!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Did any of the above questions resonate with you or make you feel
   uncomfortable...?

   I am wondering when was the last time you had someone really listen to
   you about your health and wellness, your fears and concerns, your
   frustrations and feelings with the personal attention you deserve?

   I would LOVE to hear how your journey of life has got you to a place
   where you just need a little support to be the best you can be.

   I KNOW I can banish your fears and empower you to BE the BEST you!

     * Why it is NOT you fault you 👀 in the mirror and hate what you see!!
       . From a young age we are exposed to images of the medias idea of
       what a woman "should" look like Through magazines, TV, social
       media, on billboards, on the side of a bus! . Industries that
       profit from our low self worth: Cosmetics Skin care Cosmetic
       Surgery Diet & weight loss All of which are worth BILLIONS and
       expediently grow year on year. Many of which employ psychologists
       within their marketing departments in order to manipulate how we
       feel about ourselves to buy their product!! . And then there is the
       indirect advertisements from ALL other industries that parade a
       certain type of model to sell their product. As well as celebrities
       that we just cant seem to get enough of. Who also feel this immense
       pressure! . We are conditioned to compare ourselves. To envy other
       women To compete for male attention. To compete with each other! To
       fight the aging process. To look in the mirror and hate what we
       see! So that we buy their products to "fix" what is wrong with us!!
       There is NOTHING wrong with us!!! . And the irony? We actually KNOW
       that the majority of images are air brushed 🤔 . You have to ask
       yourself how our great grandmothers managed without all these
       modern day beauty products? Maybe attraction, love & sex has been
       around for a lot longer?! Otherwise we wouldnt be here! . And while
       the profits of these industries sky rocket So does the epidemic of
       depression, anxiety & eating disorders And the scariest statistic
       of all is the number of teenagers & younger suffering. . Whose
       responsibility is it to educate young women how to love and
       appreciate their uniqueness? Why have we structured society this
       way? With an archaic school system that teaches us very few life
       coping skills. It is left to poor parents. Who often battle their
       own emotional issues!! . This was a HUGE contributing factor to my
       depression. What are your thoughts on this controversial topic? . .
     * Everything you watch, hear, see, experience is recorded by your
       subconscious mind. EVERYTHING!! From the day you were born!!! .
       Your mind is WAY smarter than you think. Everything influences the
       outcomes in your life. EVERYTHING!! So if you are watching drama
       filled, emotional triggered TV, don’t be surprised if drama is a
       part of your life. If you read books that describe heartbreak &
       difficult relationships don’t be surprised if that is your
       experience. If you watch the negativity of the news don’t be
       surprised if you struggle with life. If you are participating in
       conversations of bitching, moaning, complaining, don’t be surprised
       if there is trouble in your life also. . Your conscious mind can
       think this is a load of 💩and reject the negativity around you. But
       your subconscious mind ACCEPTS EVERYTHING it receives. It has NO
       ability to reject information. #readthatagain . The ONLY difference
       between what I have achieved & your results is I have learned to
       protect my computer between my ears. Reprogrammed my subconscious &
       deleted some of the viruses!! To transform my mind, body and life!
       I have created miracles! And achieve what most consider impossible.
       Its not rocket science. But we are not taught this in school! . So
       I will teach you! My Mindset Toolbox is ALL the tools I used &
       continue to 8 weeks 8 modules 2 bonus modules Video & written
       lectures Reading.Listening. Watching.Doing! You will be inspired &
       motivated! . It doesn’t matter what you want to achieve. Weight

       your programming. Teach you to feed your mind the right information
       for success!! In only 8 weeks! Are you ready take back control of

     * What to do when you are having a hard day 🤯 Recovered from
       depression yes but I have hard days just like anyone. It’s just I
       can deal with the hard days now so they don’t turn into hard weeks,
