Bike, a very popular means of transportation

   A bike, also called bicycle or cycle is a human-powered, ecological and
   economical transport mode. Bikes are used for commuting,
   transportation, for recreational purposes (touring, mountain bikeing…)
   and for competition (Road racing, track, BMX, MTB racing...)
   As biking is faster than walking, it is a very popular means of
   transportation in many countries.
   Bicycles are made of many simple components that all work together:
   Pedals, Crankset, Derailleurs, Cassette, Wheels, Brakes…
   The bicycle rider, also called cyclist, sit on a saddle and push the
   pedals in order to move the bike forward: the teeth on the crankset
   chainring pull the chain which is attached to the cassette.

The history of bicycles

     * 1818: Karl Von Drais created in Germany the first bike: it was a
       Draisienne or balance bike which consists of two wheels in tandem.
     * 1830: a scottish man, Kirkpatrick MacMillan, built the 1st
       two-wheeled mechanically-propelled vehicle: the two wheel
       velocipede.
     * 1860: a French man added a mechanical crank drive with a pair of
       pedals to make the first pedal-bicycle.
     * 1870: another French, James Starley, invented the High-Wheel
       bicycle.
     * 1885: Mr Starley created in England the 1st recognizably modern
       bike.
     * 1960-1970: Racing Bikes and Mountain Bikes have been invented in
       United States, during the 60s and 70s.

Bike, simple components that all work together

   Today, there are various kind of bikes, designed for specific
   disciplines: Road bikes for Road Cycling, TT Bikes for Triathlon, MTB
   for Trail Riding, Enduro, Freeride and DH Bikes for Gravity
   disciplines, BMX for BMX racing, Fixie and City Bikes for commuting…
   Whatever your budget or your fitness level, there is a bike for you:
   from Low-End to High-End bikes, from steel frames to aluminium, carbon
   or titanium frames, from light weight cycles to heavy duty cycles…
   Even if bikes are different from one discipline to another, all of them
   consists of components that work together:
     * A frame: hardtail or full suspensed, made from alloy, carbon fibre,
       steel or titanium.
     * Wheels: 20”, 24”, 26”, 27.5”, 29” or 700c.
     * Tyres: clincher or tubular, folding or wire.
     * Drivertrain: Crankset, Chain, Derailleurs, Cassette or Cog…
     * Brakes: disc brakes or V-Brakes, mechanical or hydraulic.
     * Finishing Kit: Stem, Handlebar, Grips, Seatpost, Saddle, Headset…

MTB

Birth of the mountain bike

   The MTB or Mountain Bike is a bicycle that allows to ride on uneven
   terrain thanks to wide and serrated tyres. The actual mountain bike
   (MTB) in English, designed specifically to ride off the road, was born
   in the 1970s in the United States.

   It was in 1979 that Tom Ritchey assisted by Gary Fischer and Charlie
   Kelly created the first brand of MTB (mountainbikes) and the first
   production of mountain bike series.
   Very soon the enthusiasm for mountain biking became important and
   numerous international competitions were created: 1984 first Roc
   d'Azur, 1990 first cross-country and downhill World Championship, 1996
   Olympic discipline. This is how MTB models adapted to each type of
   practice are developed. Today, brands offer different ranges ranging
   from cheap MTBs to the top-of-the-range model for extreme practices
   such as downhill.

The different types of MTB and equipment

   The practice of mountain biking has evolved enormously since its
   creation in the 70s and the offer has adapted to the different
   practices that have emerged: enduro, cross country, descent,
   all-mountain.... MTBs are distinguished by the size of the wheels: 26,
   27.5 or 29 inches, the presence of suspensions at the front and/or
   rear, the travel and the rigidity and lightness of the frame (made of
   steel, aluminium, titanium or carbon). Today almost all mountain bikes
   are equipped with disc brakes.

   Semi-rigid MTBs
     * For cross country or hiking, MTB bikes are now generally in 29
       inches and have a front suspension. The fact of not having shock
       absorbers at the rear saves weight and allows a more efficient
       pedaling. However, there are still more and more full-suspension
       mountain bikes for this discipline. The 26-inch wheels are still
       used, thanks to their small size they offer good manoeuvrability
       and allow for effective relaunch. Note that 26 inch MTBs are the
       old MTB standard and are less and less used today.

   Full-suspension MTBs

   For enduro, downhill, all-mountain and freeride, MTBs have wheels
   generally in 27.5 inches and are suspended at the front and rear. The
   frame is light (even heavier than a semi-rigid) and cushioned well,
   it's comfortable and efficient in technical downhills.
     * Enduro MTB: a clever combination of a cross-country bike and a
       downhill bike. The enduro mountain bike is usually a fully
       suspended MTB with a clearance of between 140 and 160 mm. It's made
       of aluminium, carbon or titanium.
     * Cross-country MTB: mostly semi-rigid with a suspension at the
       front, the cross-country mountain bike is lightweight and allows
       you to perform well on pedaling. Full-suspension cross-country MTBs
       offer greater comfort and are used more and more in competition.
       The frame is made of carbon or aluminium.
     * DH MTB or MTB Downhill MTB: it's a lightweight and durable bike
       with front and rear suspensions. There are also semi-rigid DH bikes
       that are more affordable if you want a cheap mountain bike. The
       center of gravity of the frame of a downhill MTB is low and
       therefore more stable, it allows the pilot to handle it more
       easily. It's usually made of aluminium or carbon, knowing that the
       carbon bike will be lighter and will better absorb the vibrations
       for better comfort.
     * Freeride MTB: equipped with front and rear suspensions, the free
       ride mountain bike is equipped with disc brakes. Designed for stunt
       riding, it's reinforced in several places to absorb shocks.
     * The all-mountain MTB: designed for a versatile practice, this
       mountain bike has full-suspension and lightness going for it.
     * The dirt MTB : inspired by the BMX, the dirt bike is compact and
       solid, easy to handle for jumps and stunts. It's used extensively
       in indoor and outdoor bike parks.

   When you make your choice, whether it's a cheap mountain bike with a
   minimum of equipment or a more sophisticated and therefore more
   expensive MTB, you'll quickly enjoy the steep trails. A carbon MTB is
   ideal if you're looking for performance. Men's mountain bikes and
   women's bikes can be distinguished as the black mountain bike is
   distinguished from the red mountain bike. Indeed, the geometry of
   women's mountain bike frames is different.

   The rider's equipment can range from a minimalist outfit (cycling
   shorts, jersey, gloves, helmet and goggles for cross-country for
   example) to a safety-oriented outfit (back protector, full-face
   helmets, protections) for the extreme practices.

Mountain Biking

   Mountain Biking, or MTBing, is the sport of riding a bike off-road,
   using specially designed bikes called Mountain Bikes.
   Mountain bikes are designed to be riden over rough terrain. Wide Tyres,
   Flat Handlebar, MTB Forks and shocks are the main differences between a
   MTB and a Road Bike.
   During the 70s, different riders in the USA claims to play a part in
   the birth of Mountain Biking. Riders adapted bikes to the rigors of
   off-road riding: better brakes, Wide Tyres, BMX-Style Handlebars...
   In the early 80s, road bike companies started to manufacture MTB. In
   1979, Tom Ritchey made the 1st regularly available MTB frame, in
   partnership with Gary Fisher and Charlie Kelly. The frame was sold by
   their company called MountainBikes.
   Quickly, Mountain Biking moved from a little know sport to a mainstream
   activity and many events were created: the first Roc d'Azur took place
   in 1984, UCI Mountain Bike Championship was created in 1990 (Downhill
   and XC) and in 1996 Mountain Biking was included for the first time in
   the Olympic Games.
   MTB became available in many shops and for each different mountain
   biking disciplines:
     * Cross country
     * All-Mountain
     * Enduro
     * Downhill
     * Freeride
     * Dirt

MTB: Find all your parts on Alltricks.com

   For each mountain biking disciplines, components and gears can be
   completely different. Today, many brands are available on the market to
   cover the needs of each discipline.
   If you are a mountain biker, your bike should be constituted as follow:
     * MTB Frame (Steel, Alloy, Titan or Carbon)
     * MTB Wheels (26, 27.5 or 29 inches)
     * MTB tyres (Tube Type or Tubeless)
     * A single, double or triple groupset.
     * Strong components: Handlebar, Stem, SeatPost, Pedals...
     * MTB forks: 80mm to 200mm travel.
     * Rear shock on full suspension bikes

   As a rider, you will need specific gears: short, jersey, gloves,
   helmet, shoes, sunglasses, knee pads....

Mountain bike equipment, MTB-specific clothing

   Have you just received your new MTB and are looking forward to riding?
   But don't forget to check if you are well equipped before you leave.
   Indeed the equipment for an MTB practice is rather specific and it's
   important to have the right clothes for it.
   MTB clothing has several roles: they allow you to protect yourself
   (thickness thought for the MTB), to bring you comfort (ergonomic cuts),
   and also bring you a true mountain bike look.
   The mountain bike equipment is very complete and you can compose an
   entire wardrobe solely dedicated to mountain biking! From MTB helmets
   to MTB shorts to knee pads, the choice of MTB clothing is great on
   Alltricks.com!

MTB clothing: for all practices

   Choose amountain bike outfit that fits your practice.
   In cross-country or in sports hiking for example, the clothes are close
   to the outfits used in road biking. Legplates, close-fitting jackets
   and lightweight gloves are all effective for pedaling and good
   aerodynamics.
   For more engaging practices like the DH or the Enduro, the clothes can
   get closer to the outfits for motocross and BMX race. The equipment has
   to be resistant to protect the pilot as best as possible. However,
   comfort and efficiency must not be overlooked when pedaling, which is
   why very technical materials are used to design MTB clothing.
   On our Alltricks site you will find the MTB outfit that will suit you
   among the best brands and many models: Castelli, Assos, Fox...

MTB Jerseys

   Bike jerseys are thought through and designed for cycling and are
   different for road cycling and mountain biking.

The road bike jersey

   The road bike jersey is close to the body to bring the cyclist
   aerodynamics and freedom of movement during the effort. It's made of
   breathable fabrics to evacuate sweat, soft and elastic materials for
   maximum comfort. The bike jersey has a pocket in the back to put
   provisions or accessories and a zip on the front to be able to open it
   in climbs if it's hot.

   The sleeves are short or long in cool weather. For outings when the
   weather is uncertain, you can add cuffs to the short-sleeved bike
   jersey or carry a windproof jacket in your pocket.

The MTB jersey

   The MTB jersey is suitable for this discipline and comes in short
   sleeves or long sleeves, it can be ample or fit like a road bike.

   In recent years, manufacturers have greatly innovated and developed
   very technical products. Today, the MTB jerseys allow the skin of the
   rider to breathe. The microfibres used allow to remove moisture, the
   fabric dries very quickly and has great elasticity.
   Besides the technical aspect, the MTB jersey, more than the MTB shorts
   for example, is an element of style! For several years, manufacturers
   have been offering ever more varied ranges where all types of designs
   blend.

   Every MTB practice has its requirements and the materials, like the
   equipment, have to be adapted.
   In cross-country, the jersey is closer to the bike jersey and is often
   identical. In this discipline you need light, breathable and
   aerodynamic jerseys.
   In more extreme practices like the enduro, the freeride or the DH, the
   MTB jerseys are closer to the BMX. There include ample cuts with long
   sleeves to facilitate the movements and to protect the pilot.
