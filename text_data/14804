Waves surge in opposite directions around Io's largest lava lake

   Space 10 May 2017

   By Aylin Woodward
   New Scientist Default Image
   Loki Patera on Jupiter’s innermost moon is a giant bowl of molten rock
   – but it doesn’t behave like one

   NASA/JPL/University of Arizona

   Surf’s up on Jupiter’s moon. Magma waves travelling both clockwise and
   anticlockwise have been spotted on the surface of a lava lake on Io,
   the most volcanically active body in the solar system.

   The lake, called Loki Patera, is a bowl-shaped volcanic crater on Io,
   Jupiter’s innermost moon. It is roughly 200 kilometres across, and
   responsible for 10 to 20 per cent of the heat that the jovian moon puts
   out.

   We’ve known that Loki periodically brightens and dims since the 1970s.
   Previous observations suggested that these changes are due to the lake
   recycling itself. As the top layer of lava cools, it solidifies and
   grows dense, until eventually it sinks beneath the underlying magma and
   pulls nearby crust with it in waves moving across the surface.

   But most of those observations, based on a technique for reducing
   atmospheric blurring called adaptive optics, were only sharp enough to
   tell which direction the waves were moving, not how fast or where they
   started.

   Now, Katherine de Kleer at the University of California, Berkeley and
   her colleagues have taken advantage of a rare collusion between
   Jupiter’s moons to get a high-quality time lapse of the lava lake’s
   surface.

   Time-lapse images of the lake’s surface reveal how its surface
   regenerates

   LBTO

   Every six years, the orbits of Io and Europa – a moon of Jupiter best
   known for its ice shell covering a liquid water ocean – align, then
   cross one another from the point of view of Earth.

   On 8 March 2015, de Kleer and her colleagues turned the Large Binocular
   Telescope Observatory in Arizona on the criss-crossing moons to observe
   the heat coming from Loki Patera in unprecedented detail.

   By combining adaptive optics with the binocular observations, they were
   able to make a map of changing temperatures over time across the lava
   lake surface with 10 times better spatial resolution than previously
   possible. “People have looked at Io with each of these methods, but not
   together,” de Kleer says.

Double wave

   Knowing the temperature of different parts of the lake and how fast the
   magma cooled and sank helped de Kleer’s team decipher which parts of
   the surface recycled at which times.

   Surprisingly, the temperature map revealed not one, but two waves, one
   clockwise and the other anticlockwise, moving from the west to the
   southeast of the lake. The waves started at different times and ran
   around a cool island in the lake’s centre.

   “It’s a giant bowl of molten rock; it should all be behaving the same,”
   says Julie Rathbun at the Planetary Science Institute in Tuscon,
   Arizona. “But having two waves suggests there are compositional
   differences within the lake, and that’s strange.”

   De Kleer thinks understanding how new magma is exposed on Loki Patera’s
   surface can offer insight into volcanism on planets and moons that are
   different from Earth. Io is in an almost constant state of eruption,
   but it lacks the plate tectonics that are responsible for much of our
   own planet’s volcanic activity. Instead, its volcanoes are largely
   driven by tidal heating from Jupiter’s enormous gravity.

   It could also shed light on subsurface oceans on moons like Europa and
   Saturn’s Enceladus, which are also probably kept warm by tidal heating.

   “The same process might lead to volcanic activity at the bottom of
   those oceans that injects the raw materials that would make these
   systems able to host life,” de Kleer says. “Understanding how heat is
   deposited in and transported through satellite interiors is therefore
   important for understanding the potential habitability of these other
   worlds.”

Rhino rescue plan decimates Asian antelopes

   12 February 2003

   By Fred Pearce

   An antelope that just a decade ago crammed the steppes of central Asia
   is this spring on the verge of extinction, victim of an epidemic of
   poaching. Biologists say it is the most sudden and dramatic population
   crash of a large mammal ever seen.
   New Scientist Default Image
   Now you see him, soon you won’t

   (Image&colon; NATUREPL.COM)

   In 1993, over a million saiga antelopes roamed the steppes of Russia
   and Kazakhstan. Today, fewer than 30,000 remain, most of them females.
   So many males have been shot for their horns, which are exported to
   China to be used in traditional fever cures, that the antelope may not
   be able to recover unaided.

   The slaughter is embarrassing for conservationists. In the early 1990s,
   groups such as WWF actively encouraged the saiga hunt, promoting its
   horn as an alternative to the horn of the endangered rhino.

   Saiga (Saiga tatarica) once dominated the open steppes from Ukraine to
   Mongolia. They have always been hunted for meat, horns and skins.
   However, even in Soviet times, hunters killed tens of thousands each
   year, without dramatically lowering the population.

   But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, a lucrative market in the
   horns has opened up, with hunters using motorcycles and high-powered
   weapons to chase and kill their quarry. In China, saiga horns fetch
   around $100 a kilogram. Organised gangs illegally export the horn by
   train from Moscow to Beijing, or across the border from Kazakhstan.

Black with antelopes

   “The plains used to be black with these antelopes, but now you can go
   out there and not see any at all,” says Abigail Entwistle, a zoologist
   from Fauna and Flora International, a British-based charity. “This is
   the most sudden change in fortune for a large mammal species recorded
   in recent times.”
   New Scientist Default Image
   Decline of the saiga antelope

   The closest comparison may be with the African elephant, which faced a
   similar poaching frenzy in the 1980s, causing its numbers to fall from
   a million to half a million in a decade. But the saiga’s numbers, which
   started at a similar level, have fallen by 97 per cent.

   The scale of the slaughter, and its almost total destruction of the
   male saiga, has overwhelmed the animals’ famed fecundity. “We don’t
   know of any case in biology where the sex ratio has gone so wrong that
   fecundity has crashed in this way,” says Eleanor Milner-Gulland of
   Imperial College, London, the leading expert in the West on the
   species.

   Between 1993 and 1998, saiga numbers across central Asia almost halved,
   to around 600,000. Then, with most of the males gone, the population
   crash began in earnest, says Milner-Gulland. Numbers have halved each
   year since, until 2001’s census recorded just 30,000 individuals. There
   is, she says, no sign that the crash is due to disease or unusual
   weather.

No return

   One of the most critically endangered herds is in the huge Betpak-Dala
   region in central Kazakhstan, where in 1993 more than half a million
   saiga lived. By 2001 their numbers had crashed to just 4000 – a 99 per
   cent drop from which there may be no return.

   Aerial surveys in 2001 by the Institute of Zoology in Kazakhstan
   revealed no adult or juvenile males, only females, says Milner-Gulland.
   And time is running out to bring extra males in, as saiga antelopes
   normally only live for three to four years.

   Conservationists have struggled to keep up with the scale of the
   disaster, and did not put the saiga on the Red List of critically
   endangered species until October 2002. In the coming months they will
   launch an emergency appeal to rescue wild herds.

   “We think we have probably got just two years to save the species,”
   says Entwistle. “The trouble is, most people have never heard of the
   animal, so it is hard to raise funds.”

Confined to zoos

   It is unlikely that hunters will drive the saiga to total extinction,
   as they did the dodo, quagga and passenger pigeon. But without a
   dramatic reversal of its fortunes, it will soon be confined to zoos and
   a few small reserves.

   A decade ago, the saiga antelope seemed so secure that conservationists
   fighting to save the rhino from poaching suggested using saiga horn in
   traditional Chinese medicines as a substitute for rhino horn.

   Research commissioned by WWF at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in
   the late 1980s found it to be as effective as rhino horn in fighting
   fevers, and in 1991 WWF began a campaign in Hong Kong to publicise it
   as an alternative. The following year, the UN Environment Programme
   appointed WWF ecologist Esmond Bradley Martin as its “special envoy” to
   persuade pharmacists across Asia to adopt saiga horn (New Scientist
   print edition, 9 March 1991 and 3 October 1992).

   But the saiga had died out in China in the 1960s, and the resulting
   upsurge in demand opened the floodgates to unregulated imports. By
   1993, says Milner-Gulland, “Hong Kong markets were piled high with
   saiga horn” from Kazakhstan and Russia. The slaughter had begun.

   Bradley Martin is unapologetic. He told New Scientist: “I supported the
   use of saiga antelope horn as a substitute for rhino horn from the
   early 1980s. In my opinion it was the correct policy at the time. But I
   stopped around 1995, when I read about the start of the sharp decline
   in saiga populations.”

Animals on drugs: 11 unlikely highs

   Life 25 June 2009

   By Rowan Hooper

   New Scientist Default Image Whatever you do, don’t give elephants LSD

   Animals take to drugs just as readily as we do. Sometimes they avail
   themselves of natural highs, and sometimes lab animals get very fond of
   substances they are fed for research. So, sit back with your stimulant
   of choice and enjoy New Scientist‘s round-up of animals on drugs.

   1. Wallabies on opium

   The marsupials of Tasmania have found a means of passing the time on
   Australia’s island state that could also explain mysterious local crop
   circles. Wallabies have been munching the poppies grown for opium by
   the pharmaceutical industry.

   “We have a problem with wallabies entering poppy fields, getting as
   high as a kite and going around in circles,” the attorney general was
   quoted in The Mercury newspaper.

   Sheep and deer have also been reported as being raving opium fiends.

   2. Elephants on acid

   In 1962, the director of a zoo in Oklahoma had the bright idea of
   firing a syringe dart containing almost 300 milligrams of LSD – about
   3000 times the normal dose a hippie would take – into one of his
   elephants. Sadly, the animal went crazy, then died.

   Elephants are regularly reported going on booze-fuelled rampages in
   India, but zoologists calculating the amount the animals would have to
   drink to get rowdy have cleared them of being under the influence. The
   aggressive elephants are simply defending their territories,
   apparently.

   3. Shrews on booze

   Pen-tailed tree shrews in Malaysia gorge themselves on the flowers of
   the bertam palm, which contain fermented nectar of up to 3.8 per cent
   alcohol.

   Unlike their distant human relatives, however, tree shrews quickly
   metabolise most of the alcohol they consume into a by-product called
   ethyl glucuronide (EtG). The stuff ends up safely stashed in the
   shrews’ fur, at levels normally found only in severely alcoholic
   humans.

   4. Pets on Prozac

   In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed a drug containing
   the same serotonin-reuptake inhibitor as Prozac for use in dogs.
   Psychiatric drugs are also used in birds, though animal welfare groups
   worried that the use of such drugs to treat behavioural problems in
   animals would create a population of “pill-popping pets”.

   5. Merry Macaques

   Type “drunk” and the name of pretty much any animal into YouTube and
   you’ll be rewarded with hilarious footage of inebriated beasts. Bears,
   for example made the news in this clip.

   In this study, however, alcoholic female macaques self-administered so
   much booze that they stopped ovulating. The study was conducted in
   order to uncover why some alcoholic women stop having periods.

   6. Mice on speed

   Mice given huge doses of methamphetamine have shown that drug cravings
   persist for months after withdrawal from the drug. The rodents were
   spiked with doses of speed equivalent to those taken by addicts on a
   binge. Researchers found long-lasting changes in key communication
   pathways in the brain. Brain changes in the mice lasted for more than
   four months, equivalent to years in humans.

   7. Monkeys on marijuana

   One study suggested that monkeys “seek out” injections of THC – the
   active ingredient in cannabis – although this was criticised as
   “pseudoscience”, admittedly by pro-marijuana groups.

   8. Uninhibited fruit flies

   Drosophila flies allowed entry to an alcohol-strewn “fly pub” not only
   got drunk – they developed homosexual tendencies. Repeated doses of
   booze led male flies to start courting other males. The researchers
   claimed that the finding may reveal how alcohol loosens human sexual
   inhibitions.

   9. Caterpillars on coke

   Drug cartels in Columbia have a more than the CIA to worry about.
   Unlike most insects, the caterpillar Eloria noyesi feeds on the leaves
   of coca plants. A comparison of the dopamine receptors in the coke
   caterpillar with those of the silkworm, which doesn’t feed on cocaine
   plants, revealed that E. noyesi has evolved resistance to the effects
   of the drug.

   10. Chimps smoking

   A female chimp in a Zhengzhou zoo in Henan province, China, reportedly
   took up smoking as a result of sexual frustration. Chimps in South
   Africa have also been filmed sucking on cancer sticks.

   11. Spiders on… pretty much everything

   Depending on your point of view, arachnids are either the luckiest of
   lab animals, or the sorriest. At NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in
   Alabama scientists dosed spiders with marijuana, the “downer” chloral
   hydrate, the “upper” Benzedrine and on caffeine. The more toxic the
   chemical, the more deformed the web, says NASA, who hope to use spiders
   in place of other lab animals.

Waves surge in opposite directions around Io's largest lava lake

   Space 10 May 2017

   By Aylin Woodward
   New Scientist Default Image
   Loki Patera on Jupiter’s innermost moon is a giant bowl of molten rock
   – but it doesn’t behave like one

   NASA/JPL/University of Arizona

   Surf’s up on Jupiter’s moon. Magma waves travelling both clockwise and
   anticlockwise have been spotted on the surface of a lava lake on Io,
   the most volcanically active body in the solar system.

   The lake, called Loki Patera, is a bowl-shaped volcanic crater on Io,
   Jupiter’s innermost moon. It is roughly 200 kilometres across, and
   responsible for 10 to 20 per cent of the heat that the jovian moon puts
   out.

   We’ve known that Loki periodically brightens and dims since the 1970s.
   Previous observations suggested that these changes are due to the lake
   recycling itself. As the top layer of lava cools, it solidifies and
   grows dense, until eventually it sinks beneath the underlying magma and
   pulls nearby crust with it in waves moving across the surface.

   But most of those observations, based on a technique for reducing
   atmospheric blurring called adaptive optics, were only sharp enough to
   tell which direction the waves were moving, not how fast or where they
   started.

   Now, Katherine de Kleer at the University of California, Berkeley and
   her colleagues have taken advantage of a rare collusion between
   Jupiter’s moons to get a high-quality time lapse of the lava lake’s
   surface.
   New Scientist Default Image
   Time-lapse images of the lake’s surface reveal how its surface
   regenerates

   LBTO

   Every six years, the orbits of Io and Europa – a moon of Jupiter best
   known for its ice shell covering a liquid water ocean – align, then
   cross one another from the point of view of Earth.

   On 8 March 2015, de Kleer and her colleagues turned the Large Binocular
   Telescope Observatory in Arizona on the criss-crossing moons to observe
   the heat coming from Loki Patera in unprecedented detail.

   By combining adaptive optics with the binocular observations, they were
   able to make a map of changing temperatures over time across the lava
   lake surface with 10 times better spatial resolution than previously
   possible. “People have looked at Io with each of these methods, but not
   together,” de Kleer says.

Double wave

   Knowing the temperature of different parts of the lake and how fast the
   magma cooled and sank helped de Kleer’s team decipher which parts of
   the surface recycled at which times.

   Surprisingly, the temperature map revealed not one, but two waves, one
   clockwise and the other anticlockwise, moving from the west to the
   southeast of the lake. The waves started at different times and ran
   around a cool island in the lake’s centre.

   “It’s a giant bowl of molten rock; it should all be behaving the same,”
   says Julie Rathbun at the Planetary Science Institute in Tuscon,
   Arizona. “But having two waves suggests there are compositional
   differences within the lake, and that’s strange.”

   De Kleer thinks understanding how new magma is exposed on Loki Patera’s
   surface can offer insight into volcanism on planets and moons that are
   different from Earth. Io is in an almost constant state of eruption,
   but it lacks the plate tectonics that are responsible for much of our
   own planet’s volcanic activity. Instead, its volcanoes are largely
   driven by tidal heating from Jupiter’s enormous gravity.

   It could also shed light on subsurface oceans on moons like Europa and
   Saturn’s Enceladus, which are also probably kept warm by tidal heating.

   “The same process might lead to volcanic activity at the bottom of
   those oceans that injects the raw materials that would make these
   systems able to host life,” de Kleer says. “Understanding how heat is
   deposited in and transported through satellite interiors is therefore
   important for understanding the potential habitability of these other
   worlds.”

Rhino rescue plan decimates Asian antelopes

   12 February 2003

   By Fred Pearce

   An antelope that just a decade ago crammed the steppes of central Asia
   is this spring on the verge of extinction, victim of an epidemic of
   poaching. Biologists say it is the most sudden and dramatic population
   crash of a large mammal ever seen.
   New Scientist Default Image
   Now you see him, soon you won’t

   (Image&colon; NATUREPL.COM)

   In 1993, over a million saiga antelopes roamed the steppes of Russia
   and Kazakhstan. Today, fewer than 30,000 remain, most of them females.
   So many males have been shot for their horns, which are exported to
   China to be used in traditional fever cures, that the antelope may not
   be able to recover unaided.

   The slaughter is embarrassing for conservationists. In the early 1990s,
   groups such as WWF actively encouraged the saiga hunt, promoting its
   horn as an alternative to the horn of the endangered rhino.

   Saiga (Saiga tatarica) once dominated the open steppes from Ukraine to
   Mongolia. They have always been hunted for meat, horns and skins.
   However, even in Soviet times, hunters killed tens of thousands each
   year, without dramatically lowering the population.

   But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, a lucrative market in the
   horns has opened up, with hunters using motorcycles and high-powered
   weapons to chase and kill their quarry. In China, saiga horns fetch
   around $100 a kilogram. Organised gangs illegally export the horn by
   train from Moscow to Beijing, or across the border from Kazakhstan.

Black with antelopes

   “The plains used to be black with these antelopes, but now you can go
   out there and not see any at all,” says Abigail Entwistle, a zoologist
   from Fauna and Flora International, a British-based charity. “This is
   the most sudden change in fortune for a large mammal species recorded
   in recent times.”

   Decline of the saiga antelope

   The closest comparison may be with the African elephant, which faced a
   similar poaching frenzy in the 1980s, causing its numbers to fall from
   a million to half a million in a decade. But the saiga’s numbers, which
   started at a similar level, have fallen by 97 per cent.

   The scale of the slaughter, and its almost total destruction of the
   male saiga, has overwhelmed the animals’ famed fecundity. “We don’t
   know of any case in biology where the sex ratio has gone so wrong that
   fecundity has crashed in this way,” says Eleanor Milner-Gulland of
   Imperial College, London, the leading expert in the West on the
   species.

   Between 1993 and 1998, saiga numbers across central Asia almost halved,
   to around 600,000. Then, with most of the males gone, the population
   crash began in earnest, says Milner-Gulland. Numbers have halved each
   year since, until 2001’s census recorded just 30,000 individuals. There
   is, she says, no sign that the crash is due to disease or unusual
   weather.

No return

   One of the most critically endangered herds is in the huge Betpak-Dala
   region in central Kazakhstan, where in 1993 more than half a million
   saiga lived. By 2001 their numbers had crashed to just 4000 – a 99 per
   cent drop from which there may be no return.

   Aerial surveys in 2001 by the Institute of Zoology in Kazakhstan
   revealed no adult or juvenile males, only females, says Milner-Gulland.
   And time is running out to bring extra males in, as saiga antelopes
   normally only live for three to four years.

   Conservationists have struggled to keep up with the scale of the
   disaster, and did not put the saiga on the Red List of critically
   endangered species until October 2002. In the coming months they will
   launch an emergency appeal to rescue wild herds.

   “We think we have probably got just two years to save the species,”
   says Entwistle. “The trouble is, most people have never heard of the
   animal, so it is hard to raise funds.”

Confined to zoos

   It is unlikely that hunters will drive the saiga to total extinction,
   as they did the dodo, quagga and passenger pigeon. But without a
   dramatic reversal of its fortunes, it will soon be confined to zoos and
   a few small reserves.

   A decade ago, the saiga antelope seemed so secure that conservationists
   fighting to save the rhino from poaching suggested using saiga horn in
   traditional Chinese medicines as a substitute for rhino horn.

   Research commissioned by WWF at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in
   the late 1980s found it to be as effective as rhino horn in fighting
   fevers, and in 1991 WWF began a campaign in Hong Kong to publicise it
   as an alternative. The following year, the UN Environment Programme
   appointed WWF ecologist Esmond Bradley Martin as its “special envoy” to
   persuade pharmacists across Asia to adopt saiga horn (New Scientist
   print edition, 9 March 1991 and 3 October 1992).

   But the saiga had died out in China in the 1960s, and the resulting
   upsurge in demand opened the floodgates to unregulated imports. By
   1993, says Milner-Gulland, “Hong Kong markets were piled high with
   saiga horn” from Kazakhstan and Russia. The slaughter had begun.

   Bradley Martin is unapologetic. He told New Scientist: “I supported the
   use of saiga antelope horn as a substitute for rhino horn from the
   early 1980s. In my opinion it was the correct policy at the time. But I
   stopped around 1995, when I read about the start of the sharp decline
   in saiga populations.”

Animals on drugs: 11 unlikely highs

   Life 25 June 2009

   By Rowan Hooper

   New Scientist Default Image Whatever you do, don’t give elephants LSD

   Animals take to drugs just as readily as we do. Sometimes they avail
   themselves of natural highs, and sometimes lab animals get very fond of
   substances they are fed for research. So, sit back with your stimulant
   of choice and enjoy New Scientist‘s round-up of animals on drugs.

   1. Wallabies on opium

   The marsupials of Tasmania have found a means of passing the time on
   Australia’s island state that could also explain mysterious local crop
   circles. Wallabies have been munching the poppies grown for opium by
   the pharmaceutical industry.

   “We have a problem with wallabies entering poppy fields, getting as
   high as a kite and going around in circles,” the attorney general was
   quoted in The Mercury newspaper.

   Sheep and deer have also been reported as being raving opium fiends.

   2. Elephants on acid

   In 1962, the director of a zoo in Oklahoma had the bright idea of
   firing a syringe dart containing almost 300 milligrams of LSD – about
   3000 times the normal dose a hippie would take – into one of his
   elephants. Sadly, the animal went crazy, then died.

   Elephants are regularly reported going on booze-fuelled rampages in
   India, but zoologists calculating the amount the animals would have to
   drink to get rowdy have cleared them of being under the influence. The
   aggressive elephants are simply defending their territories,
   apparently.

   3. Shrews on booze

   Pen-tailed tree shrews in Malaysia gorge themselves on the flowers of
   the bertam palm, which contain fermented nectar of up to 3.8 per cent
   alcohol.

   Unlike their distant human relatives, however, tree shrews quickly
   metabolise most of the alcohol they consume into a by-product called
   ethyl glucuronide (EtG). The stuff ends up safely stashed in the
   shrews’ fur, at levels normally found only in severely alcoholic
   humans.

   4. Pets on Prozac

   In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed a drug containing
   the same serotonin-reuptake inhibitor as Prozac for use in dogs.
   Psychiatric drugs are also used in birds, though animal welfare groups
   worried that the use of such drugs to treat behavioural problems in
   animals would create a population of “pill-popping pets”.

   5. Merry Macaques

   Type “drunk” and the name of pretty much any animal into YouTube and
   you’ll be rewarded with hilarious footage of inebriated beasts. Bears,
   for example made the news in this clip.

   In this study, however, alcoholic female macaques self-administered so
   much booze that they stopped ovulating. The study was conducted in
   order to uncover why some alcoholic women stop having periods.

   6. Mice on speed

   Mice given huge doses of methamphetamine have shown that drug cravings
   persist for months after withdrawal from the drug. The rodents were
   spiked with doses of speed equivalent to those taken by addicts on a
   binge. Researchers found long-lasting changes in key communication
   pathways in the brain. Brain changes in the mice lasted for more than
   four months, equivalent to years in humans.

   7. Monkeys on marijuana

   One study suggested that monkeys “seek out” injections of THC – the
   active ingredient in cannabis – although this was criticised as
   “pseudoscience”, admittedly by pro-marijuana groups.

   8. Uninhibited fruit flies

   Drosophila flies allowed entry to an alcohol-strewn “fly pub” not only
   got drunk – they developed homosexual tendencies. Repeated doses of
   booze led male flies to start courting other males. The researchers
   claimed that the finding may reveal how alcohol loosens human sexual
   inhibitions.

   9. Caterpillars on coke

   Drug cartels in Columbia have a more than the CIA to worry about.
   Unlike most insects, the caterpillar Eloria noyesi feeds on the leaves
   of coca plants. A comparison of the dopamine receptors in the coke
   caterpillar with those of the silkworm, which doesn’t feed on cocaine
   plants, revealed that E. noyesi has evolved resistance to the effects
   of the drug.

   10. Chimps smoking

   A female chimp in a Zhengzhou zoo in Henan province, China, reportedly
   took up smoking as a result of sexual frustration. Chimps in South
   Africa have also been filmed sucking on cancer sticks.

   11. Spiders on… pretty much everything

   Depending on your point of view, arachnids are either the luckiest of
   lab animals, or the sorriest. At NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in
   Alabama scientists dosed spiders with marijuana, the “downer” chloral
   hydrate, the “upper” Benzedrine and on caffeine. The more toxic the
   chemical, the more deformed the web, says NASA, who hope to use spiders
   in place of other lab animals.
