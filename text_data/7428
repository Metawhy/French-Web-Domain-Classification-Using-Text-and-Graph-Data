   Boris Johnson team considering plan to suspend parliament in run up to
   Brexit

The frontrunner in the race to become prime minister next week has pledged to
leave the EU on 31 October "do or die".

   Why you can trust Sky News

   Boris Johnson could send MPs home for up to two weeks in October under
   plans being considered by his campaign.

   Insiders have confirmed they are looking at scheduling a Queen's speech
   to mark the start of a new parliamentary session in early November.

   Parliament is usually prorogued for between one and two weeks ahead of
   a Queen's speech, meaning MPs would in effect be unavailable to stop a
   no-deal Brexit immediately before October 31.

   consideration'

   Mr Johnson's campaign confirmed it was one option being looked at but
   stressed no decision has yet been made.

   Some Tory MPs are already planning to try and stop a no-deal divorce
   with the EU in the knowledge they may no longer be coming to
   Westminster for the final two weeks in October.

   Guto Bebb, a Tory MP who wants to stop no-deal and hold a second
   referendum, confirmed he had heard the plan and was trying to work out
   what to do.

   He told Sky News: "I read consideration is being given in the Boris
   camp for proroguing parliament without a deal.

   "This is likely to be the case in the event a no-deal Brexiteer is in
   the whips' office."

   A Johnson campaign source said: "A number of ideas are under
   consideration, including this one."

   Some of those involved in transition planning in Whitehall have been
   told of the possible plan for Mr Johnson.

   Critics say the idea could scupper any attempt for Mr Johnson to leave
   the EU with a deal, since parliament would not be sitting to pass the
   necessary legislation.

   More MPs are considering following Mr Bebb by announcing they will
   stand down at the next election, freeing their hand to vote against the
   government in a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons.

   Mr Bebb warned that some of his colleagues have been complacent over
   attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit.

   He told Sky News: "Individuals need to say when they are going to act.
   The Grand Old Duke of York strategy I'm sort of bored of.

   "At some point they are going to need to make a stand and even then it
   could be too late."

   ask to delay Brexit if a deal is within reach

   It comes after Mr Johnson and his rival Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt
   ruled out accepting an idea floated to break the Brexit deadlock and
   get a deal through parliament.

   They both refused to support putting a time limit on the Irish backstop
   - the insurance policy to prevent a hard border reforming on the island
   of Ireland.

   Some Tory Brexiteers said they could support the policy to ensure the
   UK does not remain trapped in it indefinitely.

   But Brussels has insisted its inclusion is non-negotiable, including
   the Irish finance minister who said on Tuesday: "We will not be
   changing the backstop."

   Mr Johnson has pledged to leave the EU on 31 October "do or die", while
   Mr Hunt has signalled he could ask Brussels for another delay of a few
   weeks if getting a deal in that time frame is achievable.

   Boris Johnson team considering plan to suspend parliament in run up to

The frontrunner in the race to become prime minister next week has pledged to
leave the EU on 31 October "do or die".

   Why you can trust Sky News

   Boris Johnson could send MPs home for up to two weeks in October under
   plans being considered by his campaign.

   Insiders have confirmed they are looking at scheduling a Queen's speech
   to mark the start of a new parliamentary session in early November.

   Parliament is usually prorogued for between one and two weeks ahead of
   a Queen's speech, meaning MPs would in effect be unavailable to stop a
   no-deal Brexit immediately before October 31.

   consideration'

   Mr Johnson's campaign confirmed it was one option being looked at but
   stressed no decision has yet been made.

   Some Tory MPs are already planning to try and stop a no-deal divorce
   with the EU in the knowledge they may no longer be coming to
   Westminster for the final two weeks in October.

   Guto Bebb, a Tory MP who wants to stop no-deal and hold a second
   referendum, confirmed he had heard the plan and was trying to work out
   what to do.

   He told Sky News: "I read consideration is being given in the Boris
   camp for proroguing parliament without a deal.

   consideration, including this one."

   Some of those involved in transition planning in Whitehall have been
   told of the possible plan for Mr Johnson.

   Critics say the idea could scupper any attempt for Mr Johnson to leave
   the EU with a deal, since parliament would not be sitting to pass the
   necessary legislation.

   More MPs are considering following Mr Bebb by announcing they will
   stand down at the next election, freeing their hand to vote against the
   government in a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons.

   podcasts,Spotify, Spreaker

   Mr Bebb warned that some of his colleagues have been complacent over
   attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit.

   He told Sky News: "Individuals need to say when they are going to act.
   The Grand Old Duke of York strategy I'm sort of bored of.

   "At some point they are going to need to make a stand and even then it
   could be too late."

   ask to delay Brexit if a deal is within reach

   It comes after Mr Johnson and his rival Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt
   ruled out accepting an idea floated to break the Brexit deadlock and
   get a deal through parliament.

   They both refused to support putting a time limit on the Irish backstop
   - the insurance policy to prevent a hard border reforming on the island
   of Ireland.

   Some Tory Brexiteers said they could support the policy to ensure the
   UK does not remain trapped in it indefinitely.

   But Brussels has insisted its inclusion is non-negotiable, including
   the Irish finance minister who said on Tuesday: "We will not be
   changing the backstop."

   Mr Johnson has pledged to leave the EU on 31 October "do or die", while
   Mr Hunt has signalled he could ask Brussels for another delay of a few
   weeks if getting a deal in that time frame is achievable.

   GRIMSBY, UNITED KINGDOM - JANUARY 21:Buyers inspect Cod waiting to be

   industry continues to strive to be commercially viable on 21 January,
   2008, England. Fishing boats operating out of the UK are constantly
   fighting to stay solvent due to the setting of increasingly draconian
   quotas which recently resulted in some British trawlers being allowed
   to catch only one Cod per day. Up to 80 percent of the catch for sale
   at Grimsby fish docks is now imported and delivered to the sale in
   containers. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)

   weather on August 4, 2019 near Ilulissat, Greenland. The Sahara heat
   wave that recently sent temperatures to record levels in parts of

   effect in Greenland, where over the last several decades summers have
   become longer and the rate that glaciers and the Greenland ice cap are
   retreating has accelerated. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)

   BRIDGWATER, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 01: Construction continues at pace at the

   built near Bridgwater on October 1, 2018 in Somerset, England.
   According to the firm building the Somerset nuclear power station, it
   is firmly on track for its next major construction milestone. The
   construction of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by EDF Energy
   began two years ago and it is expected to provide 7% of the UK's
   electricity needs for 60 years when it is switched on in 2025. More
   than 3,200 people are currently on site building the power station near
   Bridgwater, which will be Britain's first power plant in 20 years, and
   is being built adjacent to the existing Hinkley Point A and B nuclear
   power stations and the Bristol channel. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty
