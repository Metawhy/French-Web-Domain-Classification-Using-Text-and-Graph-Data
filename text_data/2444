     missmentelle:

     Pretend, for a moment, that you’re an 18-year-old teenager from a
     family living below the poverty line.
     One day, you make a silly mistake and get a ticket for it. Nothing
     major - maybe you rode the subway without a ticket or smoked too
     close to the entrance of a building. Maybe you were loitering.
     Either way, one thing is for sure: you definitely don’t have the
     money to pay the ticket.
     So you don’t.
     Eventually, you miss the deadline to pay your ticket, and you get a
     letter in the mail that says you have to go to court. But your life
     is chaotic, and a court date for a missed ticket is the least of
     your concerns. Your family moves constantly, which disrupts your
     life and puts you behind in school. You have one disabled parent and
     one parent who is always working, leaving you to raise your younger
     siblings by yourself. You have no means of transportation. There is
     rarely any food in the cupboards. The utilities are constantly
     getting shut off. The week that you were supposed to go to court,
     your family gets another eviction notice, your cousin ends up in the
     hospital, and your parent finds out that their disability payments
     are being reduced.
     So you miss your court date.
     Since you missed the court date, you automatically lose your case -
     now you have no hope of arguing your way out of the ticket, which
     you still can’t afford to pay. You can do community service hours
     instead of paying, but you don’t have time to do that, now that you
     have to work part-time and odd jobs on top of everything else to
     keep your parents off the streets and your siblings out of foster
     care. You know that you probably won’t finish high school on time,
     let alone fulfill your hours. You might be able to explain your
     circumstances to the judge, but you have no idea how to go about
     doing that now that you’ve missed your court date, your literacy
     skills are years behind thanks to your constant game of school
     roulette, and even though legal help is available to you, you don’t
     know how to access it or if you can afford to do so. But that’s
     still the least of your concerns - since you missed your court date,
     the judge has also charged you with failure to appear.

     Which means you now have an active warrant out for your arrest.
     And just like that, you’re now a part of the criminal justice
     system. A silly mistake that a middle-class teenager could have
     solved with Mommy and Daddy’s chequebook in a single afternoon has
     caused you weeks or months of stress and headaches over a process
     you don’t fully understand, and has ended in criminal charges.
     Instead of having a funny story to tell over dinner when you come
     home from college next Thanksgiving, you are now facing additional
     fines (that you still can’t pay), the possibility of a couple of
     nights in jail, the possible suspension of your driver’s license,
     and the possibility of being taken into custody any time you
     interact with the police. The next time your parent comes home drunk
     and violent, or someone breaks into the house, you think twice about
     calling the cops - you now have to decide if every emergency
     is “worth” the possibility of being hauled off to jail. And in the
     meantime, the circumstances that caused that first mistake haven’t
     gone away - you still don’t have the money to pay for the subway,
     you are still more likely to live in a house filled with smokers,
     you still can’t afford quit-smoking aids, you still live in a
     chaotic household that deeply affects your mental health, and you
     still don’t understand the legal system or who you’re supposed to
     talk to for information and resources.
     So while those other teenagers get to go through life believing that
     they were “good kids who sometimes made silly mistakes”, you now get
     to go through life thinking of yourself as a criminal. And that
     might be the most damaging thing of all.

     When I worked with homeless teenagers and young adults, I saw this
     process play out again and again and again and again. The kids often
     considered themselves “criminals” or “bad kids” because they had
     arrest warrants and criminal records, but few of them had ever
     actually committed a serious or violent crime - the vast majority
     were simply unlucky kids who did something stupid and didn’t have
     the skills or resources (or wealthy parents) required to get them
     off the hook. I had classmates in my upper-middle-class high school
     who did far worse things with far fewer consequences, because Mommy
     was a lawyer or Daddy was an RCMP officer, and some of those kids
     grew up to be lawyers or police officers themselves. The kids I
     worked with never got that opportunity. Second chances cost money,
     and the difference between a “crime” and a “mistake” has less to do
     with the offense, and more to do with the circumstances you were
     born into.

     So when we’re talking about crime, punishment and who is “worthy” of
     being helped, maybe keep that in mind.

     “second chances cost money, and the difference between a ‘crime’ and
     a ‘mistake’ has less so do with the offense, and more to do with the
     circumstances you were born into.”

how to write that 17-page essay that’s high-key giving you anxiety

   thewriterslament:

     so it’s 4am and you’ve had three cups of coffee but you’ve only
     written two sentences. you look at the prompt and find it has ceased
     to make sense. “how the fuck am i gonna turn this into a 17-page
     paper” you ask.

     never fear! your friendly neighborhood college fuckup is here with
     an answer. buckle down and get another cup of coffee; you’re in this
     for the long haul. (literally. this post got long because i’m
     apparently incapable of writing short posts, but i also pulled a 3.9
     cGPA using this method so i’d say it’s worth the read.)
     * first, a cheat: email your professor and ask if you can use
       subheaders. subheaders eliminate the need for smooth transitions
       between portions of your argument and also create a ton of white
       space, which can help you reach page count.
     * second, a tip: don’t be afraid to meet with your prof. this essay
       probably isn’t a take-home exam; it’s likely that your prof set
       this paper to give you a chance to learn and write about something
       you enjoy. shoot your prof an email saying “hey, this is what i’m
       thinking, this is what i’m struggling with, can i meet with you to
       talk it out?” 9 times out of 10, your prof will say yes. if they
       say no, talk to another prof in the same discipline. otherwise talk
       to your uni writing center or a friend of yours. worse come to
       worst, shoot me a message.
     * what you’re gonna do now is outline the fuck out of your paper to
       procrastinate actually writing it.
     * step 1: take apart the prompt. it’ll be asking for a few different
       things; mark these things with different cues: brackets,
       underlining, different colored pens, whatever. this structures your
       response.

     * if you don’t know your thesis yet, that’s fine! let it develop
       naturally as you conduct your research and plan your argument. you
       can change it as you go - that’s the point of researching the
       topic. no one will know what your first draft thesis was.

     step 2: look at the dismembered prompt. write bullets with brief
   explanations for how you’ll attack each part of the prompt. these can
   be detailed or as vague as “look up that one reading and use it as a
   counter argument.” then figure out the best way to organize the
   bullets. if nothing makes sense, that’s fine too. you can write each
   chunk of your argument and structure it later.

     * these bullets make good subheaders. js.

     step 3: under each bullet from step 2, list out what info and
   evidence you need for that aspect of your argument. don’t worry about
   details yet; focus on structure. write these bullets as though you’re
   talking to a friend about what your argument is and why is works. let
   it be stupid. let it be simple. say shit like “freud was a bitch and i
   can prove it.”

     step 4: now that you have a rough draft of your outline, go back and
   fill in the details. remember, you’re still outlining! you’re basically
   redoing step 3 with the bullets you made in step 3. this is the part
   where i take the most time and put in the most effort.
     * i tend to reach page/word count easily if my outline is half the
       length the paper needs to be, so i keep outlining until i reach
       that point. this ratio might be different for you. if you can
       figure out your ratio, it can tell you if you need to look for more
       info or if you’re good to go.
     * make a note of what you’re citing but don’t worry about actual
       citations. i like using gdocs because you can easily paste a link
       to your source in a comment. this way, the sources don’t clutter up
       your doc or artificially inflate your page or word count.
     * be silly! be stupid! use swear words and memes and internet lingo.
       you’re just outlining right now; you don’t need to sound smart and
       professional. you should be focusing on what you want to say, not
       how to say it.
     * by the end of this process, my outline is basically my paper in
       bulletpoint format, without any fancy jargon or quotes or cited
       evidence, and usually not in complete sentences. i’ve essentially
       tricked myself into writing my paper by saying “i’m just outlining,
       it doesn’t really matter.” it’s also less daunting to write the
       rest of the paper when you know you already have 9 pages done
       instead of 0.

     step 5: write the damn thing! open a fresh doc for your paper and
   view it side-by-side with your outline. now you get to make your
   bullets sound pretentious and academic. insert quotes and other
   evidence. turn “freud was a bitch” into “freud knowingly perpetuated
   several falsehoods for the sake of his personal gain, thereby undoing
   decades of progress in the field of psychology.”
     * don’t worry about citations right now, though! do what you did in
       your outline and insert the citations as comments at the points
       where they need to be. creating citations will interrupt your flow.

     step 6: once your paper is done, go back and add citations! this can
   take up to an hour depending on how many sources you have, so budget
   your time appropriately.

     holy shit! you just wrote a whole damn paper! i’m proud of you,
   buddy. go buy yourself a milkshake and take a nap.

     inkskinned:

     writing-prompt-s:

     At 18, everyone receive a superpower. Your childhood friend got a
     power-absorption, your best friends got time control, and they
     quickly rise into top 100 most powerful superheroes. You got a
     mediocre superpower, but somehow got into the top 10. Today they
     visit you asking how you did it.

     “Power absorption?” you ask him over your pasta, which you are
     currently absorbing powerfully. in the background, a tv is reading
     out what the Phoenix extremeist group has done recently. bodies,
     stacking.

     tim nods, pushing his salad around. “it’s kind of annoying.” he’s
     gone vegan ever since he could talk to animals. his cheeks are
     sallow. “yesterday i absorbed static and i can’t stop shocking
     myself.”

     “you don’t know what from,” shay is detangling her hair at the
     table, even though it’s not polite. about a second ago, her hair was
     perfect, which implies she’s been somewhere in the inbetween. “try
     millions of multiverses that your powers conflict with.”

     “did we die in the last one?” you grin and she grins and tim grins
     but nobody answers the question.

     now she has a cut over her left eye and her hair is shorter. she
     looks tired and tim looks tired and you look down at your
     18-year-old hands, which are nothing.

     they ship out tomorrow. they go out to the frontlines or wherever it
     is that superheroes go to fight supervillains; the cream of the
     crop. the starlight banner kids.

     “you both are trying too hard,” you tell them, “couldn’t you have
     been, like, really good at surfing?”

     “god,” shay groans, “what i’d give to only be in the olympics.”

     xxx
     in the night, tim is asleep. on the way home, he absorbed
     telekinesis, and hates it too.

     shay looks at you. “i’m scared,” she says.

     you must not have died recently, because she looks the same she did
     at dinner, cut healing slowly over her eye the way it’s supposed to,
     not the hyper-quickness of a timejump. just shay, living in the
     moment when the moment is something everyone lives in. her eyes are
     wide and dark the way brown eyes can be, that swelling fullness that
     feels so familiar and warm, that piercing darkness that feels like a
     stone at the back of your tongue.

     “you should be,” you say.

     her nose wrinkles, she opens her mouth, but you plow on.

     “they’re going to take one look at you and be like, ‘gross, shay? no
     thanks. you’re too pretty. it’s bringing down like, morale, and
     things’. then they’ll kick you out and i’ll live with you in a box
     and we’ll sell stolen cans of ravioli.”

     she’s grinning. “like chef boyardee or like store brand?”

     “store brand but we print out chef boyardee labels and tape them
     over the can so we can mark up the price.”

     “where do we get the tape?”

     “we, uh,” you look into those endless dark eyes, so much like the
     night, so much like a good hot chocolate, so much like every
     sleepover you’ve had with the two of your best friends, and you
     say, “it’s actually just your hair. i tie your hair around the cans
     to keep the label on.”

     she throws a pillow at you.

     you both spend a night planning what you’ll do in the morning when
     shay is kicked out of Squadron 8, Division 1; top rankers that are
     all young. you’ll both run away to the beach and tim will be your
     intel and you’ll burn down the whole thing. you’re both going to
     open a bakery where you will do the baking and she’ll use her time
     abilities to just, like, speed things up so you don’t have to wake
     up at dawn. you’re both going to become wedding planners that only
     do really extreme weddings.

     she falls asleep on your shoulder. you do not sleep at all.

     in the morning, they are gone.

     xxx

     squadron 434678, Division 23467 is basically “civilian status.” you
     still have to know what to expect and all that stuff. you’re glad
     that you’re taking extra classes at college; you’re kind of bored
     re-learning the stuff you were already taught in high school. there
     are a lot of people who need help, and you’re good at that, so you
     help them.

     tim and shay check in from time to time, but they’re busy saving the
     world, so you don’t fault them for it. in the meantime, you put your
     head down and work, and when your work is done, you help the people
     who can’t finish their work. and it kind of feels good. kind of.

     xxx

     at twenty, squadron 340067, division 2346 feels like a good fit. tim
     and you go out for ice cream in a new place that rebuilt after the
     Phoenix group burned it down. you’ve chosen nurse-practitioner as
     your civilian job, because it seems to fit, but you’re not released
     for full status as civilian until you’re thirty, so it’s been a lot
     of office work.

     tim’s been on the fritz a lot lately, overloading. you’re worried
     they’ll try to force him out on the field. he’s so young to be like
     this.

     “i feel,” he says, “like it all comes down to this puzzle. like i’m
     never my own. i steal from other people’s boxes.”

     you wrap your hand around his. “sometimes,” you say, “we love a
     river because it is a reflection.”

     he’s quiet a long time after that. a spurt of flame licks from under
     his eyes.

     “i wish,” he says, “i could believe that.”

     xxx

     twenty three has you in squad 4637, division 18. really you’ve just
     gotten here because you’re good at making connections. you know
     someone who knows someone who knows you as a good kid. you helped a
     woman onto a bus and she told her neighbor who told his friend.
     you’re mostly in the filing department, but you like watching the
     real superheroes come in, get to know some of them. at this level,
     people have good powers but not dangerous ones. you learn how to
     help an 18 year old who is a loaded weapon by shifting him into a
     non-violent front. you get those with pstd home where they belong.
     you put your head down and work, which is what you’re good at.

     long nights and long days and no vacations is fine until everyone is
     out of the office for candlenights eve. you’re the only one who
     didn’t mind staying, just in case someone showed up needing
     something.

     the door blows open. when you look up, he’s bleeding. you jump to
     your feet.

     “oh,” you say, because you recognize the burning bird insignia on
     his chest, “I think you have the wrong office.”

     “i just need,” he spits onto the ground, sways, collapses.

     well, okay. so, that’s, not, like. great. “uh,” you say, and you
     miss shay desperately, “okay.”

     you find the source of the bleeding, stabilize him for when the
     shock sets in, get him set up on a desk, sew him shut. two hours
     later, you’ve gotten him a candlenights present and stabilized his
     vitals. you’ve also filed him into a separate folder (it’s good to
     be organized) and found him a home, far from the warfront.

     when he wakes up, you give him hot chocolate (god, how you miss
     shay), and he doesn’t smile. he doesn’t smile at the gift you’ve
     gotten him (a better bulletproof vest, one without the Phoenix on
     it), or the stitches. that’s okay. you tell him to take the right
     medications, hand them over to him, suggest a doctor’s input. and
     then you hand over his folder with a new identity in it and a new
     house and civilian status. you take a deep breath.

     he opens it and bursts into tears. he doesn’t say anything. he just
     leaves and you have to clean up the blood, which isn’t very nice of
     him. but it’s candlenights. so whatever. hopefully he’ll learn to
     like his gift.

     xxx

     squadron 3046, division 2356 is incredibly high for a person like
     you to fit. but still, you fit, because you’re good at organization
     and at hard work, and at knowing how to hold on when other people
     don’t see a handhold.

     shay is home. you’re still close, the two of you, even though she
     feels like she exists on another planet. the more security you’re
     privy to, the more she can tell you.

     you brush her hair as she speaks about the endless man who never
     dies, and how they had to split him up and hide him throughout the
     planet. she cries when she talks about how much pain he must be in.

     “can you imagine?” she whispers, “i mean, i know he’s phoenix, but
     can you imagine?”

     “one time i had to work retail on black friday,” you say.

     she sniffles.

     “one time my boss put his butt directly on my hand by accident and i
     couldn’t say anything so i spent a whole meeting with my hand
     directly up his ass,” you say.

     her eyes are so brown, and filling, and there are scars on her
     you’ve never noticed that might be new or very, very, very old; and
     neither of you know exactly how much time she’s actually been alive
     for.

     “i mean,” you say, “yeah that might hurt but one time i said goodbye
     to someone but they were walking in the same direction. i mean can
     you imagine.”

     she laughs, finally, even though it’s weakly, and says, “one time
     even though i can manipulate time i slept in and forgot to go to
     work even though i was leading a presentation and i had to look them
     in the face later to tell them that.”

     “you’re a compete animal,” you tell her, and look into those eyes,
     so sad and full of timelines you’ll never witness, “you should be
     kicked out completely.”

     she wipes her face. “find me in a box,” she croaks, “selling
     discount ravioli.”

     xxx

     you don’t know how it happens. but you guess the word gets around.
     you don’t think you like being known to them as someone they can go
     to, but it’s not like they’ve got a lot of options. many of them
     just want to be out of it, so you get them out, you guess.

     you explain to them multiple times you haven’t done a residency yet
     and you really only know what an emt would, but they still swing by.
     every time they show up at your office, you feel your heart in your
     chest: this is it, this is how you die, this is how it ends.

     “so, like, this group” you say, trying to work the system’s
     loopholes to find her a way out of it, “from ashes come all things,
     or whatever?”

     she shrugs. you can tell by looking at her that she’s
     dangerous. “it’s corny,” she says. another shrug. “i didn’t mean to
     wind up a criminal.”

     you don’t tell her that you sort of don’t know how one accidentally
     becomes a criminal, since you kind-of-sort-of help criminals out,
     accidentally.

     “i don’t believe any of that stuff,” she tells you, “none of that
     whole… burn it down to start it over.” she swallows. “stuff just
     happens. and happens. and you wake up and it’s still happening, even
     though you wish it wasn’t.”

     you think about shay, and how she’s covered in scars, and her crying
     late at night because of things nobody else ever saw.

     “yeah,” you say, and print out a form, “i get that.”

     and you find a dangerous woman a normal home.

     xxx

     “you’re squadron 905?”

     “division 34754,” you tell him. watch him look down at your ID and
     certification and read your superpower on the card and then look
     back up to you and then back down to the card and then back up at
     you, and so on. he licks his chapped lips and stands in the cold.

     this happens a lot. but you smile. the gatekeeper is frowning, but
     then hanson walks by. “oh shit,” he says, “it’s you! come right on
     in!” he gives you a hug through your rolled-down window.

     the gatekeeper is in a stiff salute now. gulping in terror. hanson
     is one of the strongest people in this sector, and he just hugged
     you.

     the gate opens. hanson swaggers through. you shrug to the
     gatekeeper. “i helped him out one time.”

     inside they’re debriefing. someone has shifted sides, someone
     powerful, someone wild. it’s not something you’re allowed to know
     about, but you know it’s bad. so you put your head down, and you
     work, because that’s what you’re good at, after all. you find out
     the gatekeeper’s name and send him a thank-you card and also
     handmade chapstick and some good earmuffs.

     shay messages you that night. i have to go somewhere, she says, i
     can’t explain it, but there’s a mission and i might be gone a long
     time.

     you stare at the screen for a long time. your fingers type out three
     words. you erase them. you instead write where could possibly better
     than stealing chef boyardee with me?

     she doesn’t read it. you close the tab.

     and you put your head down. and work.

     xxx

     it’s in a chili’s. like, you don’t even like chili’s? chili’s sucks,
     but the boss ordered it so you’re here to pick it up, wondering if
     he gave you enough money to cover. things have been bad recently.
     thousands dying. whoever switched sides is too powerful to stop.
     they destroy anyone and anything, no matter the cost.

     the phoenix fire smells like pistachios, you realize. you feel at
     once part of yourself and very far. it happens so quickly, but you
     feel it slowly. you wonder if shay is involved, but know she is not.

     the doors burst in. there’s screaming. those in the area try their
     powers to defend themselves, but everyone is civilian division. the
     smell of pistachios is cloying.

     then they see you. and you see them. and you put your hands on your
     hips.

     “excuse me, tris,” you say, “what are you doing?”

     there’s tears in her eyes. “i need the money,” she croaks.

     “From a chili’s?” you want to know, “who in their right mind robs a
     chili’s? what are you going to do, steal their mozzarella sticks?”

     “it’s connected to a bank on the east wall,” she explains, “but i
     thought it was stupid too.”

     you shake your head. you pull out your personal checkbook. you ask
     her how much she needs, and you see her crying. you promise her the
     rest when you get your paycheck.

     someone bursts into the room. shouts things. demands they start
     killing.

     but you’re standing in the way, and none of them will kill you or
     hurt you, because they all know you, and you helped them at some
     point or another, or helped their friend, or helped their children.

     tris takes the money, everyone leaves. by the time the heroes show
     up, you’ve gotten everyone out of the building.

     the next time you see tris, she’s marrying a beautiful woman, and
     living happily, having sent her cancer running. you’re a bridesmaid
     at the wedding.

     xxx

     “you just,” the director wants to know now, “sent them running?”

     hanson stands between her and you, although you don’t need the
     protection.

     “no,” you say again, for the millionth time, “i just gave her the
     money she needed and told her to stop it.”

     “the phoenix group,” the director of squadron 300 has a vein
     showing, “does not just stop it.”

     you don’t mention the social issues which confound to make criminal
     activity a necessity for some people, or how certain stereotypes
     forced people into negative roles to begin with, or how an uneven
     balance of power punished those with any neurodivergence. instead
     you say, “yeah, they do.”

     “i’m telling you,” hanson says, “we brought her out a few times. it
     happens every time. they won’t hurt her. we need her on our team.”

     your spine is stiff. “i don’t do well as a weapon,” you say, voice
     low, knowing these two people could obliterate you if they wished.
     but you won’t use people’s trust against them, not for anything.
     besides, it’s not like trust is your superpower. you’re just a
     normal person.

     hanson snorts. “no,” he says, “but i like that when you show up, the
     fighting just… stops. that’s pretty nice, kid.”

     “do you know… what we are dealing with…. since agent 25… shifted….?”
     the director’s voice is thin.

     “yeah,” hanson says, “that’s why i think she’d be useful, you know?
     add some peace to things.”

     the director sits down. sighs. waves her hand. “whatever,” she
     croaks, “do what you want. reassign her.”

     hanson leads you out. over your shoulder, you see her put her head
     in her hands. later, you get her a homemade spa kit, and make sure
     to help her out by making her a real dinner from time to time,
     something she’s too busy for, mostly.

     at night, you write shay messages you don’t send. telling her things
     you cannot manage.

     one morning you wake up to a terrible message: shay is gone. never
     to be seen again.

     xxx

     you’re eating ice cream when you find him.

     behind you, the city is burning. hundreds dead, if not thousands.

     he’s staring at the river. maybe half-crying. it’s hard to tell, his
     body is shifting, seemingly caught between all things and being
     nothing.

     “ooh buddy,” you say, passing him a cone-in-a-cup, the way he likes
     it, “talk about a night on the town.”

     the bench is burning beside him, so you put your jacket down and
     snuff it out. it’s hard sitting next to him. he emits so much.

     “hey tim?” you say.

     “yeah?” his voice is a million voices, a million powers, a terrible
     curse.

     “can i help?” you ask.

     he eats a spoonful of ice cream.

     “yeah,” he says eventually. “i think i give up.”

     xxx

     later, when they praise you for defeating him, you won’t smile. they
     try to put you in the media; an all-time hero. you decline every
     interview and press conference. you attend his funeral with a veil
     over your head.

     the box goes into the ground. you can’t stop crying.

     you’re the only one left at the site. it’s dark now, the subtle
     night.

     you feel her at your side and something in your heart stops hurting.
     a healing you didn’t know you needed. her hands find yours.

     “they wanted me to kill him,” she says, “they thought i’d be the
     only one who could.” her hands are warm. you aren’t breathing.

     “beat you to it,” you say.

     “i see that,” she tells you.

     you both stand there. crickets nestle the silence.

     “you know,” she says eventually, “i have no idea which side is the
     good one.”

     “i think that’s the point of a good metaphor about power and
     control,” you say, “it reflects the human spirit. no tool or talent
     is good or bad.”

     “just useful,” she whispers. after a long time, she wonders, “so
     what does that make us?”

     xxx

     it’s a long trek up into the mountains. shay seems better every day.
     more solid. less like she’s on another plane.

     “heard you’re a top ten,” she tells me, her breath coming out in a
     fog. you’ve reclassed her to civilian. it took calling in a few
     favors, but you’ve got a lot.

     “yeah,” you say, “invulnerable.”

     “oh, is that your superpower?” she laughs. she knows it’s not.

     “that’s what they’re calling it,” you tell her, out of breath the
     way she is not, “it’s how they explain a person like me at the top.”

     “if that means ‘nobody wants to kill me’, i think i’m the opposite.”
     but she’s laughing, in a light way, a way that’s been missing from
     her.

     the cabin is around the corner. the lights are already on.

     “somebody’s home,” i grin.

     tim, just tim, tim who isn’t forced into war and a million
     reflections, opens the door. “come on in.”
     xxx
     squadron one, division three. a picture of shay in a wedding dress
     is on my desk. she looks radiant, even though she’s marrying little
     old me.

     what do i do? just what i’m best at. what’s not a superpower. what
     anyone is capable of: just plain old helping.

     Written art. Beautiful. Better than most movies. Please read and
     share.

     Because one time the professor I was interning for got punched in
     the face by another professor, because mine got the funding, and
     told the other professor his theory was stupid.

     This same professor told me to throw rocks to scare the “stupid
     fucking crabs” into moving so we could count them properly.

     SCIENCE

     thank you

     this is one of the best comments this post has recieved

     I have witnessed:

     Two professors hiding around a corner and snickering, “Shhh, here
     she comes!” While a female professor approached and, when she
     finally found them, she proceeded to scream while pointing from one
     to the other, “You! I called your office but you weren’t there! So I
     tried to call YOUR office to figure out where HE was but YOU weren’t
     there!”

     Two grad students standing outside a closed and locked door yelling,
     “Come out of the damn office. You haven’t left for days. If you
     didn’t have a couch in there I’d be concerned as to where you were
     sleeping!”

     A religious studies professor apologizing for being late to class
     because, “security stopped me because I’m dressed like a hobbit”

     Watched a professor snort the results of my experiment to determine
     if I had the right final compound.

     Two archeology professors toss priceless fossilized teeth back and
     forth in an attempt to figure out who is smarter by “guessing the
     type of tooth and species of animal before it lands”

     Multiple fully degreed individuals throw dry ice at one another in
     an attempt to be first to use the lab/get that piece of equipment/or
     change the iPod song.

     A genetics professor build furniture out of stacks of paper and
     planks of wood because she is that far behind in grading
     papers/responding. One of the impromptu furniture pieces housed a
     fish tank.

     I could go on but I think that covers the larger portion of the
     insanity…

     Every time it comes around on my dash, it gets better.

   Anonymous asked:

   So I'm pretty much top tier terrified because the Amazon Rainforest is
   on fire. Like, that's seriously bad, isn't it??? How are we supposed to
   bounce back from this...?
   [avatar_0536d0c96746_96.pnj]

   hope-for-the-planet Answer:

   image

   Hey Anon! I’ve gotten a lot of asks about the Amazon forest fire
   situation so I’m going to address them all here.

   The most concerning thing about the Amazon fires isn’t necessarily the
   fires themselves, but the reason that there are so many this year: This
   is almost certainly because Brazil’s current president is very
   anti-environmentalist, which has led to more clearing of the forest
   (which involves setting fires).

   The fires themselves aren’t actually a new threat. People have been
   practicing slash-and-burn agriculture in the Amazon for a long time.
   What’s different this year is that there seem to be more fires than
   usual and they are impacting densely populated locations.

   Something that I think is being glossed over by many of the images and
   headlines being passed around is that it’s very normal for there to be
   forest fires in and around the Amazon at this time of year.

   Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research says that this is a
   record year for forest fires in Brazil since they started monitoring
   fires via satellite in 2013.

   However, NASA says that the overall fire activity in the Amazon basin
   as a whole is actually slightly below average compared to the last 15
   years; fire activity has increased in Amazonas and Rondonia but has
   decreased in Mato Grosso and Pará.

   A manager for Global Forest Watch has said that the fires this year are
   roughly equivalent to what they saw in 2016 (according to satellite
   images). Now, 2016 was also a bad year for forest fires, but it goes to
   show that this level of fire is not unheard of.

   So, why are we only hearing about the fires this year if they’ve been
   this bad before? Probaby because ash clouds darkened the sky over the
   most populated city in Brazil, which is a big, dramatic, apocalyptic
   thing that tends to get people’s attention.
   image

   Although some meteorologists think the ash over Sao Paulo may have been
   caused by fires in Paraguay, not even in the Amazon, the air quality in
   populated areas has been so strongly affected that Amazonas has
   declared a state of emergency.

To be clear, it is still definitely bad that parts of the Amazon are burning
and the fact that the fires are impacting air quality in populated cities
poses very real human health risks. We should be speaking out about this,
drawing attention to it, and donating to organizations that are working to
protect the Amazon. But this is not necessarily an apocalyptic scenario.

   And the good news? #PrayforAmazonia went viral on Twitter. Tons and
   tons of news sources are covering these fires in a way that Amazon
   forest fires have not been covered in the past. People are talking
   about Amazon deforestation and its potential impact on climate change.

   This whole debacle is generating a lot of outrage towards Brazil’s
   presidential administration. Hopefully, this will lead to more
   international support for those who are fighting his damaging policies
   towards the Amazon and the indigenous communities that rely on it. By
   the way, I think it bears mentioning that last week an indigenous
   women’s march occupied a Brazilian health ministry building in protest
   of their president’s harmful policies.

   Do you want to help? Donate! I really cannot stress how much small
   amounts of money can go a long way in situations like this.

   Donate to SOS Amazonia, a Brazilian NGO working to preserve the Amazon
   (I can’t find any third party information on how reputable this NGO is,
   but I think this may largely be because of the language barrier-they’ve
   been operating since the 1980s)

   Donate to Rainforest Trust which buys and protects rainforest land all
   around the world (4/4 stars on Charity Navigator)

   And don’t forget to vote for politicians that prioritize environmental
   protection and can put pressure on Brazil’s government to clean up its
   act!

     Okay, you need to make sure you play this game at some point. Maybe
     not today or anything, because you’ll need about thirty minutes and
     a serious willingness to understand how it works, but - it’s so
     worth it. It’s basically an answer to our occasional frustration -
     why do assholes always come out on top? - and the beautiful thing
     about it is that not only does it explain how that happens, but also
     how we can change it.
     image

     “In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long
     run, it’s us players who define the game.”

     This is fascinating if you’re into math or sociology or computer
     programming or all of the above.

     Everyone, everywhere, without exception, should play this thing
     through.

     Don’t check just this - check out all of Nicky Case’s work. They’re
     a brilliant creator and I heavily recommend checking out at least
     one of their projects.  Their website can be found here.

     Parable of the Polygons - an interactive experiment that shows how
     tiny individual biases can collectively cause segregation on a
     massive scale.

     To Build a Better Ballot - an interactive experiment that shows the
     alternatives to the voting systems we currently use and how they can
     be more representative and democratic, along with their faults.

     Coming Out Simulator - a short interactive story/novel about coming
     out, based off of Case’s own experiences. Not one I’ve played myself
     but still one I can recommend.

     Loopy - a very simple but useful tool to show how systems interact
     with each other and how things can self-propagate.

     We Become What We Behold - “ a game about news cycles, vicious
     cycles, infinite cycles.“ A short five-minute game about news and
     media. Warnings for violence, blood, death and stress.

     I havent seen anyone talk about this yet so im making a post.

     So lets say you’re researching something for a paper (or just for
     fun) and the research paper you want to read is behind a paywall, or
     the site makes you create an account first, or makes you pay to
     download, or limits you to only 5 free articles, or otherwise makes
     it difficult for you to read what you want.
     image

     do not fear! copy the link to the article
     image

     go to sci-hub.se         (the url is always changing so its best to
     check out whereisscihub.now.sh to find what the current url is)
     image

     slap the article link in there

Experienced Medblrs Please Help

   medschoolgrind:

     miss-sassmaster:

     justinegoestomedschool:

     I’m looking for tips anyone might have on transitioning from second
     year to third year. What to bring, what to expect, what to do, etc.
     I’m taking it easy and relaxing right now but I’d like to start
     preparing for clinicals at some point and getting advice is a nice
     first step.

     Congrats on moving from the classroom to the field!

     Some things you can do to make the transition a little easier;
     * Talk to soon to be 4th years who have already been to your rotation
       sites to get information about preceptors and expectations.
     * Look over your schedule and pay attention to oddities or changes
       because those are what will get you in trouble.
     * Get a copy of pocket medicine to keep with you.
     * Get little notebooks, little ipad, something to take notes with.
     * Download apps that are pertinent to whatever rotation your on (med
       calc, epocrates, etc)
     * Get pens you like, and pens you’re willing to never see again.
     * Snacks, snacks, snacks.
     * Organize whatever resources you’ll be using to study for your first
       few rotations, so there’s no last minute scrambling for materials.
     * Come in with a good attitude and take initiative to learn and
       help.
     * Try to keep as much relevant information from step 1 in your head.
       It will always come back to haunt you.
     * Learn the difference between critique and criticism. It’ll save you
       some heartache.
     * Enjoy the time you have off while you have it!

     I have a ton more I could say about rotations in general, but I can
     stick to what you’ve asked. Good luck!

     Top notch advice! I’m just going to add one thing that I tell all of
     the young in’s at my school:

     Take some time before third year to evaluate your daily routine and
     find 2-3 “non-negotiables”. Basically things outside of medicine
     that make you feel like a human being and there is no way you could
     function without them. They shouldn’t be super basic (like food - no
     shit everyone needs food. Don’t forget to eat) but more things that
     norish your soul specifically.

     Mine were: working out and getting 8 hours of sleep (this counts
     because it’s not just “sleep”, it’s a specific amount of sleep
     that’s actually kinda high)

     I talked to a friend of mine about this and he said his would be:
     walking his dog, eating dinner with his fiancé

     The key to non-negotiables is that they are non-negotiable. You
     can’t say “well today this won’t happen bc of x, y, z”. These should
     be above your priorities of studying! (The only exception is when
     scheduling required by the school keeps you from doing something.
     Don’t try to sleep 8 hours on a 24 hour shift.) The point is that
     when you are figuring out what you can fit in to each day after work
     these two or three (it’s really much easier to start with two
     though) things should be at the top of your list. Everything else is
     (you got it) negotiable. THIS INCLUDES DOING UWORLD QUESTIONS. Yes,
     you can’t put them off every day, but if they are cutting into your
     non-negotiable time then you need to schedule them for a different
     day.

     Ok, I’ve already typed enough. This is my method! It took me awhile
     to figure it out actually but it’s how I plan on approaching
     residency and I wish I’d started earlier!

     Have fun in third year! It’s amazing!

LISTEN UP

   standingonabeachatsunset:

     humanityinahandbag:

     humanityinahandbag:

Today I did something that terrified the fuck out of me. But ladies, we all
gotta do it at some point.

     I got a contract for fulltime work given to me.

     I looked at it.

     I realized, calculating the amount they wanted to offer, that it
     would actually be less than I’m making part-time now.

     So what did I do?

     Let me tell you, every single piece of me wanted to stay quiet and
     settle and work my way up the ladder.

     Until I realized that
    1. I am worth more than they were offering, and it would be an
       insult to value me at any less than my actual worth.
    2. I have a masters and a year’s worth of teaching under my belt.
    3. I am a qualified professional who wants to make more than
       assistants pay.

     Their reasoning for the pay was insurance. I’m given insurance
     that’s worth a great deal, so I shouldn’t worry too much because
     that added up to a bigger salary. Except insurance doesn’t do jack
     shit if I can’t pay for an apartment or car costs or student loans.

     What did I do?
       _______________________________________________________________

     First

     I breathed. I took a breath. I washed my face and had a quick cry in
     the bathroom. Ain’t nothing wrong with a real fast cry.

     Second

     I left a note on my bosses desk asking if he could speak to me about
     my contract whenever he was next available.

     Third

     Once in my bosses office, I calmly handed him my contract back and
     said, “I’m very honored that you thought of me for a position, but I
     cannot accept what you’re offering me. I have a masters and I’ve
     taught in this school for a year, and I’d been under the assumption
     that I’d be receiving a different position than this.” He asked me
     what I was looking for. I said, “I would work for no less than [MY
     RANGE]. And if you cannot offer me that, then I’ll have to continue
     working for you part time until I can find another position
     elsewhere that can.” I thanked him very much for the offer. I was
     polite and upfront about my expectations for the position that I
     wanted.
       _______________________________________________________________

     I can’t tell you what will happen. But I can tell you that going in
     there and establishing myself as a no BS worker who looks out for
     herself and negotiates got me farther than if I’d said nothing.

     I don’t know the outcome yet. I really don’t.

     But I can tell you that he is currently rewriting my contract with
     higher pay.

     Will it be high enough to keep me there? I don’t know.

     But I do know that today was me putting myself forward and taking a
     chance, and chances, no matter how small, do pay off.

Ladies.

     DON’T BE AFRAID TO SPEAK ABOUT YOUR CONTRACTS.

     IT’S FUCKING TERRIFYING.

     BUT DO IT ANYWAY.

     BECAUSE YOU’RE WORTH MORE, AND THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT.

     Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

GUESS WHO FUCKING GOT HER MONEY TODAY

     OPs first post came across my dash and I wanted to reblog it, but
     then I decided to see if there was a conclusion to this story and
     this makes it even better!

     cilein:

     Hyperkalaemia ECG changes in 15 seconds.

     High levels of potassium destabilise the cardiac membrane causing
     arrhythmia’s which lead to cardiac arrest. This can be a real
     life-saving opportunity if you can catch and treat it!

     I made this as an experiment while learning a bit more about After
     Effects to animate my medical illustration. Hope it’s useful!

     Amazing!
     Please do more.
