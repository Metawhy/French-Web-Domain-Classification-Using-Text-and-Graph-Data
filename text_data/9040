Spix’s Macaw heads list of first bird extinctions confirmed this decade

Eight bird species, including two species of macaw, look set to have their
extinctions confirmed following a robust new assessment of Critically
Endangered species. The findings reveal a worrying new trend: for the first
time, mainland extinctions are outpacing island extinctions.

   By Alex Dale

   In the 2011 animated film Rio, Blu, a captive-raised Spix’s Macaw,
   arrives in Brazil to mate with the last-known wild member of his
   species a female named Jewel. But according to our latest paper, Blu
   was already 11 years too late – Jewel, the last of her kind, likely
   perished in or around 2000.

   Spix’s Macaw Cyanopsitta spixii is one of eight species primed to have
   their extinctions either confirmed or deemed highly likely, following a
   new study by BirdLife International. The eight-year study used a new
   statistical approach to analyse 51 Critically Endangered species,
   quantifying three factors at once: intensity of threats, timing and
   reliability of records, and the timing and quantity of search efforts
   for the species. Five of the eight confirmed or suspected extinctions
   took place on the South American continent, four of them in Brazil,
   reflecting the devastating effects of the high rate of deforestation in
   this part of the world.

   “Ninety per cent of bird extinctions in recent centuries have been of
   species on islands” says Dr Stuart Butchart, BirdLife’s Chief Scientist
   and lead author on the paper. “However, our results confirm that there
   is a growing wave of extinctions sweeping across the continents, driven
   mainly by habitat loss and degradation from unsustainable agriculture
   and logging”.

   Of the eight species, it was recommended that three species should be
   re-classified as Extinct; the Cryptic Treehunter Cichlocolaptes
   mazarbarnetti and Alagoas Foliage-gleaner Philydor novaesi, two
   ovenbirds from North-east Brazil, and Poo-uli Melamprosops phaeosoma,
   formerly of Hawaii, which has not been seen in the wild since 2004 (the
   same year the last captive individual died). The data also suggests
   another four species should be reclassified as Critically Endangered
   (Possibly Extinct), a category that indicates that the species is
   highly likely to be extinct, but further search efforts are required
   before we can definitively rule it to be Extinct.

   These species are New Caledonian Lorikeet Charmosyna diadema (last
   sighted in 1987), Javan Lapwing Vanellus macropterus (1994), Pernambuco
   Pygmy-owl Glaucidium mooreorum (2001) and another Brazilian macaw,
   Glaucous Macaw Anodorhynchus glaucus (1998).

   Hope still persists for the Spix’s, however, despite the Brazilian
   endemic apparently being wiped out in the wild as a result of
   deforestation and other factors such as the creation of a dam and
   trapping for wild trade. An estimated population of between 60-80
   persists in captivity, hence the suggested classification change to
   Extinct in the Wild. A lone sighting in 2016 sparked hope the species
   may persist in the wild, but it is now suspected to be an escapee from
   captivity. If so, it is sadly highly unlikely this Blu ever found his
   Jewel.


   Further our research and ensure other Critically Endangered species
   don't suffer the same fate by supporting our work here.

Scale of illegal bird killing in the Middle East revealed for first time

   A study out today, for the first time, estimates the scale and extent
   of the illegal killing and taking of wild birds in the Arabian
   Peninsula, Iraq and Iran. Using a diverse range of data sources and
   incorporating expert knowledge, we estimate that at least 1.7–4.6
   million birds of at least 413 species may be killed or taken illegally
   each year in this region, many of them on migration. Worryingly, this
   is likely to be an underestimate as data were unavailable for parts of
   the region.

Meet the Lazarus Birds: 5 species once presumed extinct

Scale of illegal bird killing in the Middle East revealed for first time

   A study out today, for the first time, estimates the scale and extent
   of the illegal killing and taking of wild birds in the Arabian

   incorporating expert knowledge, we estimate that at least 1.7–4.6

   each year in this region, many of them on migration. Worryingly, this

   the region.
