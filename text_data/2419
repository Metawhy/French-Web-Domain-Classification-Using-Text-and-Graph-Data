Best of the 80s

   a celebration of the most awesome decade ever… to the max.


Big Earrings

   •July 7, 2017 • Leave a Comment

   “I went to the mall with a couple of friends.
   I had a whole week’s allowance to spend.
   I want hoop earrings and a Benetton shirt.
   We came here to shop and we came here to flirt…”
   -Robin Sparkles, “Let’s Go to the Mall”

   We’ve spent years, it seems, praising the big-ness of the 80s,
   particularly in the fashion world. From big hair (we ♥ it!) to big
   shoulder pads (them too!) to the big 80s mustache (of course!),
   everything, it seemed, was big.

   So it stands to reason that the trend continued to the jewelry counter.

   And, boy, did it ever.

   No earrings were too big. Whether big ol’ hoops or the crucifix that
   dangled from Madonna’s lobes or whatever Cyndi Lauper was wearing in
   the “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” video, 80s earrings were all about
   making a statement. With an exclamation mark. And then underlined. And
   then put in bold type.

   And why not? In a decade full of big colors, big chunky sweaters, and
   yes, that big hair, it only stands to reason. It was as if everyone was
   just trying to scream, “Hey world! Look at my ears!”

   …which brings us to Neneh Cherry and the gargantuan gold, um, things
   that stretched her lobes down to her shoulders in the 1988 video for
   “Buffalo Stance”.

   And it wasn’t just the kids donning the monster earrings, plenty of
   adults got in on the action, too. Need we remind you of the big, dangly
   (diamond-encrusted) beauties that Joan and Linda often sported on
   Dynasty?

   Yes, the 80s were a strange time indeed, but they were also wonderful.
   Wonderfully big, of course.

   We ♥ big 80s earrings.

Bloom County

   •July 6, 2017 • Leave a Comment

   “Pear pimples for hairy fishnuts!”

   It was born on December 8, 1980. Or hatched. Or spawned. Or…who knows?
   Bloom County was (and still is!) such a nutso creation that we’re not
   really sure how to describe its creation.

   We just consider ourselves lucky to have been around for it.

   The chronicles of Opus (the penguin), Steve Dallas (the male chauvinist
   cad), Milo Bloom (the precocious pre-teen reporter), Bill the Cat
   (ACK!), Bobbi Harlow (“Tomato!”), and the rest of the motley crew was
   one of the freshest and most timely comic strips ever conceived.

   Creator Berke Breathed skewered everything from Reagan’s America to
   Apartheid to the Falklands war, often mercilessly, and it earned
   actually earned him the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in
   1987—quite the feat for a strip that appeared alongside Cathy and
   Beetle Bailey every morning.

   From “T’aint corn. It’s dope. Take a bushel home for the wife!” to
   “Gene Simmons Never Had a Personal Computer When He was A Kid”, Bloom
   County gave us all something to laugh at—never stupid and always
   hilarious.

   And who could forget the debut single from Bill the Cat’s heavy metal
   band? Included as a flexi-disc in the 1987 collection Billy and the
   Boingers: Bootleg, “I’m A Boinger/U-Stink-But-I-♥-U” was just the kind
   of out-of-the-box thinking that cemented the legacy of Bloom County as
   the pop culture phenomenon it was.

   But alas…all things must come to an end, and we said goodbye to our
   favorite comic strip on August 6, 1989. It was perfect, really, making
   Bloom County a true child of the 80s.

   That is—until July 13, 2015, when the gang returned on Breathed’s
   Facebook page. Now everyone, young and old, can understand what we’ve
   known all along…that Bloom County was (and is) one of the best things
   to emerge from our favorite decade.

   We ♥ Bloom County.

Raiders of the Lost Ark

   •July 5, 2017 • Leave a Comment

   “Indiana Jones. I always knew some day you’d come walking back through
   my door. I never doubted that. Something made it inevitable…”

   Sure, Marion might have been expecting Indiana Jones, but we sure
   weren’t. In June 1981, we got a new hero (as the poster told us) “from
   the creators of Jaws and Star Wars“. And he was unlike anything we had
   ever seen before.

   With a leather jacket and fedora and a bullwhip clipped to his belt,
   Indiana Jones may have looked like Han Solo (thank you, Harrison
   Ford!), but this guy was wholly original. Was he a jet-setting
   adventurist? A book-wormy professor? A super-intense archaeologist?
   Yes, yes, and yes.

   We’re first introduced to him in Peru, as he outwits the most deadly
   Rube Goldberg contraption ever invented, culminating with the
   now-famous boulder run…only to be forced to surrender the little golden
   idol to the evil Belloq. From there it’s off to Nepal (and his reunion
   with Marion) and then on to Cairo for his showdown not only with Belloq
   but with the even-more-evil Nazi Arnold Toht.

   From start (literally…how cool is it that the image of the Paramount
   logo dissolves into a Peruvian mountain?) to finish (as the ark’s crate
   is stored in a warehouse that rivals Sam’s Club), Raiders is one of the
   80s’ best and most memorable. Who can forget the face-melting; the
   staff’s headpiece burning Toht’s hand; Indy’s fight with that big,
   burly bad guy at the airplane (and then the big burly bad guy meeting
   the business end of the propeller); or Hollywood’s best-ever “fight”
   scene, as Indy watches an Arab swordsman’s flourishing display before
   dispatching him quickly with a single bullet?

   Directed by Steven Spielberg from a story by George Lucas, Raiders of
   the Lost Ark (which has since, heinously, been renamed Indiana Jones
   and the Raiders of the Lost Ark) was easily the #1 movie of 1981,
   almost doubling the take of the #2 film On Golden Pond, and it’s still
   listed in the top 25 of all time. It was amazing then, and it still
   holds up today.

   “Snakes. Why’d it have to be snakes?”

The Message

   •July 3, 2017 • Leave a Comment

   “Don’t push me, ’cause I’m close to the edge. I’m trying not to lose my
   head…”

   While we can’t technically express our ♥ for the #2 song on Rolling
   Stone‘s list of the 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time (The
   Sugarhill Gang’s seminal “Rapper’s Delight” debuted four months too
   early, in September 1979), we can talk about #1. And, man, do we ♥ it.

   Generally when lists like that come out there’s always debate about the
   top entry…but not this time. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s
   “The Message” is, and will always be, the best, most influential, and
   all out dope-ist hip-hop track ever. Period.

   Aside from using one of the funkiest (and most widely-sampled) riffs in
   hip-hop, it was the first rap record to actually talk about inner-city
   life in all its un-glory. Until “The Message” rap was mostly
   self-congratulatory boasts and/or disses of other sucka MCs. But with
   lyrics like:

   Rats in the front room, roaches in the back,
   Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat,
   I tried to get away, but I couldn’t get far,
   ‘Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car.

   …mainstream America not only got a vivid picture of a whole other
   world, but fellow rappers also realized they had a real platform for
   speaking the truth and subsequently affecting some change.

   It was, after all, called “The Message” for a reason…

   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   Chart-wise, “The Message” didn’t do too much, peaking at #53 in
   November 1982 and spending a total of 24 weeks on the chart, but it’s
   impact on society (and the rap world, in particular) can’t be
   overstated. Public Enemy’s Chuck D said it best, calling “The Message”
   a total knock out of the park.

   We couldn’t agree more.

   “It’s like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from goin’
   under.”

   We ♥ Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s “The Message”.

21 Jump Street

   •June 30, 2017 • Leave a Comment

   “We never thought we’d find a place where we belong. Don’t have to
   stand alone, we’ll never let you fall…”

   We all know Miami Vice (which we ♥) was “MTV cops”…which of course
   makes 21 Jump Street “high school cops”.

   The honchos at Fox knew exactly what they were doing when they launched
   their fledgling network’s prime time schedule in April 1987. Along with
   The Tracey Ullman Show and Married…with Children, they gave us one of
   the grittiest and smartly-written shows of its day…a series about a
   group of young-looking cops who could easily infilrate high schools,
   colleges, juvenile detention centers…

   21 Jump Street was NYPD Blue long before NYPD Blue was even a thing.
   And it also introduced the world to a fella named Johnny Depp.

   As officer Tom Hanson, Depp went from unknown actor to absolute 100%
   dreamboat teen idol almost overnight. And what wasn’t to love? As the
   pretty half of the “McQuaid Brothers”, alongside Peter DeLuise’s Doug
   Penhall, he made Jump Street his show, investigating everything from
   heroin deals to teen rape to life in a gang. All these years later we
   still vividly remember the Season 3 two-part finale “Loc’d Up” as
   Hanson went undercover with Ioki (the vastly underrated Dustin Nguyen)
   and was convicted of murder.

   Little cutie-pie Hanson? Murder?? Say it ain’t so!

   Eventually the fame and adoration got to Depp, and he quit the show
   after the fourth season, and he was followed quickly by DeLuise and
   Nguyen. Holly Robinson (who also -trivia alert!- sang the theme song)
   was the only original cast member to stick with the show through its
   entire five-year run…despite the fact that Fox bailed, too, after
   season 4.

   https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgvsDZlm9ps?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   We didn’t even mention pretty-boy Richard Grieco’s brief one-season
   stint as Booker (which resulted in his horribly ill-advised spinoff) or
   good ol’ Captain Fuller, who kept the gang all together…at least as
   long as he could.

   Of course, most kids these days just know 21 Jump Street as a
   (hilarious, sure) movie (and sequel) starring Channing Tatum and Jonah
   Hill, and they probably don’t even understand why Depp and DeLuise show
   up for a cameo at the end of the film.

   Sigh.

   At least we kids of the 80s remember the one and only…the original…and
   it’s just another reason that our favorite decade was the best decade.

   “I said jump! Down on Jump Street!”

   We ♥ 21 Jump Street.

Spokey Dokeys

   •June 29, 2017 • Leave a Comment

   “Bike wheels come alive!”

   It’s a nice warm summer night. You’re out riding bikes with your pals,
   maybe headed to the neighborhood pool, maybe chasing after the ice
   cream truck. No helmet, no pads of any kind—just tearing down the
   street with reckless abandon, popping wheelies and jumping every
   pothole.

   And whenever you slow down, you hear the familiar
   clack-clack-clackety-clack-clack of your Spokey Dokeys.

   Yet another fine example of “why didn’t I think of that” genius-ness
   that made someone rich, Spokey Dokeys (or Spokey Dokes, depending on
   the time of day) were as simple an idea as you could come up
   with—little plastic beads that loosely snapped onto your bicycle spokes
   and, whenever you slowed down enough, slid down and back up the spokes
   to make that old familiar clacking sound.

   Of course if you went any faster than, say, two miles and hour, the
   centifugal force would just pin the Spokey Dokeys to the outside of
   your rims…but that’s okay. If you really wanted perpetual clacking you
   could always just tuck the jack of clubs into your spokes.

   Our crack team of researchers couldn’t find any retro commercials for
   Spokey Dokeys anywhere on the vast interwebs, but we did find a
   present-day video…just for those of you who may have forgotten this
   little example of 80s awesomeness.

   https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWcAnznl1ZI?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   In their day Spokey Dokeys came in a variety of colors (including the
   coveted glow-in-the-dark for when you were out chasing lightning bugs),
   but now these things have almost taken on a life of their own, coming
   in metallic versions, flower-shaped, and even LED light-up varieties.

   We’ll still go for just the regular ol’ original version, though, thank
   you very much. But right now we gotta jet. Mom’s calling us for dinner.

   We ♥ Spokey Dokeys.

One Night in Bangkok

   •June 28, 2017 • Leave a Comment

   “Bangkok, Oriental setting, and the city don’t know that the city is
   getting the creme de la creme of the chess world in a
   show with everything but Yul Brynner…”

   Show of hands…when Murray Head’s “One Night in Bangkok” first hit our
   ears in the spring of 1985, how many of you knew it was from a new West
   End musical?

   Sure enough, the Asian-themed pop ditty was the first single released
   from the concept album for Chess, a musical about rival American and
   Soviet chess players squaring off in the World Championships.

   So why did its lead single become a huge pop sensation? Well, because
   the songwriters were none other than Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.

   Who, you ask? None other than the “B” and “B” in ABBA. And those boys
   know how to write hits.

   And it didn’t hurt that the singer was none other than Murray Head, who
   had Billboard success back in 1969, singing “Superstar” from Jesus
   Christ Superstar.

   “One Night in Bangkok” was a synth-heavy, upbeat pop jam, making it
   totally perfect for our favorite decade. And the double entendre lyrics
   made it even more fun:
   “I don’t see you guys rating the kind of mate I’m contemplating.
   I’d let you watch, I would invite you, but the queens we use would not
   excite you.”

   https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgc_LRjlbTU?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   “One Night in Bangkok” skyrocketed up the Billboard charts over the
   course of its 20-week run, peaking at #3 in May 1985…making it the
   highest-charting song from a musical in the Hot 100 since “Aquarius/Let
   The Sunshine In” from Hair hit #1 in 1969. And it’s the only
   musical-based song to chart in the top 30 since.

   If that weren’t enough, the song’s legacy was truly cemented in 2011’s
   The Hangover Part II, when Mike Tyson belted out his own rendition.
   (Refresh your memory here.)

   “I can feel the devil walking next to me.”

   We ♥ One Night in Bangkok.
