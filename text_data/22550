U.N.: Record-high global demand for fish threatens oceans

Fish more important than ever in people’s diets, but growing demand threatens
sustainability of aquaculture and fishing

   May 19, 2014 12:14PM ET
   by Peter Moskowitz @ptrmsk

   People are eating more fish. This might seem a relatively neutral
   phenomenon in terms of global consequences, but a new report released
   Monday by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
   argues that while fish has become an increasingly important part of
   human nutrition and a booming industry, increased consumption has
   negative implications for the Earth’s oceans.

   The U.N. report focuses on the growth of aquaculture — fish farming —
   as well as the capture of wild fish. It suggests that growing demand
   threatens to destabilize the fishing industry, potentially leading to
   serious environmental consequences.

   The report contends that aquaculture — if it is done correctly — can
   help meet the growing demand for protein worldwide and can help relieve
   pressure on wild fish populations. But the FAO also warns that bad
   management practices could lead to unnecessary food waste and strain
   already parched ecosystems.

   While the report does not address the interaction between wild and
   farmed fish, it comes at a time of growing concern over the
   environmental implications of aquaculture in the United States and
   elsewhere. Some environmental groups warn that farmed fish — especially
   genetically modified salmon — have the potential to overwhelm wild
   populations and weaken their genetic pools, contributing to a decline
   in wild populations around the world.

   The U.N. report says that fisheries and aquaculture produced 174
   million tons of fish in 2012, 11 million tons more than in 2010. Most
   of that growth came from farmed fish. The increase in production
   matches a growing demand: Fish consumption has risen from an annual
   average of 22 pounds per person in the 1960s to nearly double that in
   2012.

   Fish has become an increasingly important source of protein, especially
   in the developing world. In 2012 it accounted for about 17 percent of
   global protein intake, and in some coastal populations it can account
   for more than 70 percent.

   But fish isn’t only an important source of food. The U.N. report says
   60 million people work in the fishery and aquaculture sector, with a
   whopping 84 percent of those jobs in Asia and 10 percent in Africa.

   The report says that aquaculture is playing an important role in
   keeping pressure off wild fish as consumer demand increases — but not
   enough to stem overfishing. It says that in 2012 about 30 percent of
   fishing was being done in an unsustainable way from the world’s oceans
   and waterways. That was the highest percentage of unsustainability in
   fishing the U.N. has found since 1974.

   While the U.N. says that the overall increase in aquaculture was
   positive — providing much-needed protein for an expanding population —
   it warns that increasingly prevalent practices need to be reformed to
   ensure sustainable growth.

   One of the biggest problems, the U.N. says, is the world’s preference
   for larger species of fish. Instead of introducing a diversity of
   species into aquaculture, producers seem to be using smaller wild fish
   to feed their stocks of larger farmed fish — a practice that depletes
   wild stocks. The U.N. says it also leads to food waste: Larger fish
   require more energy to produce, and people often throw out fish bones
   and heads before eating the meat.

   The U.N. report comes as some environmentalists in North America warn
   of the potential dangers of poorly managed fish farms.

   Environmental organizations have pointed out that such farms can lead
   to chemical contamination of water and other forms of pollution and
   can promote bacteria and diseases that can make their way into wild
   ecosystems.

   Farmed salmon has the biggest potential for environmental
   damage, according to the World Wildlife Fund, an environmental advocacy
   group.

   Several studies have found that escaped farmed salmon eventually end up
   mingling with wild populations, potentially disturbing the balance of
   ecosystems. In New Brunswick’s Magaguadavic River, for example,
   researchers say there are now more farmed salmon than wild ones.

   While aquaculture might be causing some of those problems, the U.N.
   report says it must also be part of the solution.

   "We need to ensure that environmental well-being is compatible with
   human well-being in order to make long-term sustainable prosperity a
   reality for all," FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva said in a
   news release. “The health of our planet as well as our own health and
   future food security all hinge on how we treat the blue world."
