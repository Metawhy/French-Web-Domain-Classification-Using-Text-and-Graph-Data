V2.1 Snapdragon 810 Will Be Present In OnePlus 2

   By Omar Sohail
   Jun 18, 2015
   14Shares
   Share Tweet Submit

   Those who have been anxiously waiting for the arrival of OnePlus 2 will
   be required to wait a little longer because OnePlus has not delayed nor
   shortened its timetable of releasing the handset during Q3, 2015. While
   there were several leaks stating that OnePlus 2 would be featuring
   Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 SoC, it has now been confirmed that the
   smartphone will be running the latest version of the company’s flagship
   chipset, which happens to be V2.1. Let us hope Qualcomm’s efforts are
   finally able to bear fruit this time.

   V2.1 Snapdragon 810 Will Be Present In OnePlus 2

OnePlus 2 Stated To Have Gone Through A Rigorous Testing Phase Without Its
Chipset Overheating

   Thanks to popular social networking giant Facebook, an image stating
   which chipset would be running inside OnePlus 2 had been revealed. Even
   though Xperia Z3+ and Xperia Z4 are running updated versions of
   Snapdragon 810, temperatures as high as 69 degrees Celsius were
   reported on the aforementioned devices, which does not give consumers
   any confidence when the intend on purchasing the upcoming handset.
   However, in order to allay the concerns of future potential smartphone
   owners, OnePlus has detailed in its blog that:

     “Although there have been reports that the 810 runs warmer than its
     predecessors, we assure you that we have taken all the necessary
     precautions and beyond to prevent this from occurring in the 2. We
     worked very closely with Qualcomm’s engineers to integrate an
     improved version of the chipset (v2.1) in the OnePlus 2, and
     fine-tuned both hardware and software. The 2 will be cooler than
     ever. Inside the 2, the 810 consists of several CPU processors.
     Layered on top of these processors is both thermal gel and graphite
     placed across different areas of the phone. This graphite ensures
     that heat generated from the processors will dissipate evenly, as
     opposed to being concentrated and leading to performance issues.
     After rigorous testing, the 2 meets the industry standard for phone
     temperature, even with hours of use.”

   V2.1 Snapdragon 810 Will Be Present In OnePlus 2

   Let us hope that whatever new engineering approach OnePlus and Qualcomm
   have decided to take, it works out well in their favor.

   Since we have seen too many evidences of Snapdragon 810 go beyond its
   thermal limits, a proper temperature benchmarking test is going to have
   to be carried out in order to ensure that OnePlus 2 is free from the
   overheating and thermal throttling plague.
