Food Styling & Photography Workshop March 28th - April 1st 2017 in
Charleston, SC.

February 2, 2017

   Carrots-2 Everytime I do workshops, I get inspired by the people who
   come to attend the creative space we put together for them. The one I
   taught last week was no exception and as soon as we wrapped on a week
   of shooting and good eating, I texted my bestie, professional food
   stylist Tami Hardeman, to see if the was available to do another with
   me. See, we always try to carve out some time in the year to get
   together and shoot. She food styles, we compose, I shoot. It’s a time
   for us to challenge ourselves but also create together. We nourish both
   our souls and our bodies.
   And when she said “yes”, she just about made my day. We both have busy
   schedules that don’t often match so finding a week to be together and
   share with others what we know and love is important to us. “Choose a
   job you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life”
   Confucius said. And we believe that.
   She is an amazing food stylist, with great art directorial skills in my
   opinion, and she always makes me a better photographer. My goal when we
   are on set is to push my own creativity and skills to show off hers.
   So, that’s why I am excited to announce that we are holding a creative
   food styling and photography workshop March 28th-April 1st in
   Charleston, SC. (registration open HERE)
   During the three days of workshop (first and last day being your travel
   days), we will do lots of hands on demos showing you our process and
   guiding you through your own mini photoshoots. While we like to shoot
   “pretty foods”, we also know the challenges faced by many of you trying
   to shoot “brown foods” or “flat foods” and will guide you through those
   challenges. She will share her best tips and techniques about food
   styling and I will share mine about choosing the right lens for the
   food, how to work the light to your advantage, working camera angles
   and settings. Together we will talk you through picking the best props
   and composition to showcase your food.
   We aim to create a collaborative environment where you are free to
   expand upon your usual repertoire or dig deeper into the vibe you like.
   While we love to push ourselves beyond our own comfort zone, we also
   want to foster the style and mood you like or help you get happy
   venturing out to new territory. We will provide you with the tools and
   knowledge to do over three fun and energizing days.
   Because we believe in the beauty of imperfections, we will show you how
   to create real life images not perfect ones, images that let the food
   shine and help you tell a story. If you have taken workshops with me
   before, this one is the perfect extension to those. A workshop v2 if
   you like. If this is the first time you are considering a workshop with
   us, fear not, we will take every hands on demo from a to z as far as
   process goes and make “rounds” when you are shooting to offer help and
   guidance. Oh and we are planning a photoshoot on the beach where we
   hope to have everyone contributing their own creativity. (the house we
   will be staying in as a group is just a few steps from the ocean).
   Follow this link for the registration page.
   Here are the details:
   3 days of photography, composition, food styling hands on demo and
   photoshoots with our guidance and help March 28th - April 1st (March

A weekend in Columbia, South Carolina...or 72 hours of great food and
culture!

January 17, 2017

                                  Columbia

   Back in late November (Halloween weekend actually), I traveled to
   Columbia, South Carolina, on assignment for Garden&Gun magazine and the
   Columbia Midlands Authority for 72 hours to explore and venture around
   the city for their upcoming feature in this month's issue. It was a
   packed trip of food and cultural outings but I had the best partner in
   crime. My husband. Sending a French to the state capital is one thing,
   but armed with her best weapon, a Charleston born and bred husband who
   attended college there and whose great grand father was governor of
   South Carolina and thus resided in the Capital, was probably the most
   fun way to explore a city. Lots of walking around, driving around,
   eating everything and asking all the questions...

                             Spotted Salamander

   We got to Columbia on time for a late lunch at The Spotted Salamander
   in the historic district. Sweet little spot with an extra outdoor space
   and friendly staff. Missed their renowned deviled eggs as they were not
   making them that weekend but everything else we ordered (crisp pork
   belly salad and the hot turkey sandwich) was spot on.

   Hampton-Preston House
   I am more of a nibbler/grazer than a sit down lunch or dinner gal so
   after what felt to me like a bigger meal than I do most days, we
   decided to walk the historic district and hopefully catch up on a house
   visit before they'd close for the day. We got right on time to catch up
   the last guided tour of the Hampton Preston House and stole a few extra
   moments walking the grounds before heading back to our hotel (perfectly
   located to boot...)

                                  Warmouth

   Dinner was at The Warmouth. A cool little place located in a revamped
   car garage. It was warm enough to sit on the back patio which was nice
   and quiet. While I've had many a cheese and charcuterie boards in my
   life, I remain attracted to those boasting house made cured meats and
   terrines. The Warmouth charcuterie board was served with various
   pickles and mustard. The pickled pineapple was a revelation. Must
   duplicate soon!

                                  Bourbon_3

   The bustle outside and inside of Bourbon on Main street lured us in for
   a nightcap and satisfied our thirst for a couple of cocktails and
   bourbons and some chit chat at the bar with other patrons.

                                  Bourbon_2

   Their bourbon list is extensive and the cocktails creative. It also
   serves a late food/nibbles menu.

                               The Wired Goat

   Our Saturday started at The Wired Goat Cafe. Really cool breakfast
   place offering a wide variety of coffees and coffee drinks, breakfast
   sandwiches and waffles. Come early because the line can get quite long
   as it is a favorite with the locals. Don't miss the oak smoked sea salt
   and honey latte. I still have dreams about it. All their breads and
   baked goods are made on the premises daily which is definitely a plus
   in my book.

                              SodaCityMarket_1

   If you've have been following me for a while you know how much I love
   farmers market. Nothing better to get the beat of a city. The Soda City
   Market that occupies much of Main street on Saturdays is a great mix of
   artists, food vendors and farmers. Lots of food trucks and plenty of
   street music at every corner.

                              SodaCityMarket_2

                                Museum Of Art

   To break away from the bustle of the market, we crossed the street and
   headed inside the Columbia Museum of Art. The permanent exhibit is
   really well aid out and offers way more than just a glimpse into the
   history of the arts. I didn't expect to see so much and we ended
   staying a good couple of hours. By the time we were done, a faint
   rumbling could be heard in our stomachs. Time to eat again...!

                                Museum Of Art

                              Southern Belly_3

   I don't know what it is with French peeps and barbecue but we love it.
   And can't get enough of it. So I was really looking forward to our
   lunch stop at Southern Belly. While the inside is cozy and funky at the
   same time, we couldn't resist grabbing a table outside on such a
   gorgeous day. We got two of their famous sandwiches, the Django and the
   Castro and devoured them with reckless abandon. A part of my brain
   wanted to order a couple more "for the road" but it wasn't time to head
   back to Charleston quite yet..

                              Southern Belly_2

   We drove around town a bit and even caught the USC marching band
   rehearsing before their game that evening. Back in the 70s my husband
   was in the same marching band so it was a really cool trip down memory
   lane. Just from the look in his eyes, I knew that one little moment had
   made the entire trip for him. I mean, tagging along with a photographer
   on an eating and cultural discovery mission is nice but sometimes
   disjointed for him!

                                State Museum

   From our hotel, we walked down to the State Museum which we had both
   visited before a few times but there were a couple of things we wanted
   to see. I really wanted to give a long at their new telescopes exhibit
   and hopefully catch a glimpse of the skies through their major one and
   my husband wanted to see the Anderson car that was built to rival
   (never did but what a beauty!) the Ford back in the days and designed
   and built in South Carolina by a family member. The museum gives a
   thorough history of the South throughout the years, and f you have
   kids, there are tons of various exhibits and activities for them.

                            Motor Supply Company

   A quick nap at the hotel and we were magically hungry again! Our next
   stop was walking distance from the hotel on Gervais street, The Motor
   Supply Company. What an evening! Josh, the bartender is a master at his
   craft, truly. We started with one of the cocktails on the menu and soon
   we were talking about old fashioned drinks, the resurgence of vermouth
   based cocktails and before we knew it, we had a couple more before our
   meal. And a couple afterwards. Good thing we only had to cross the
   street back to our room!! The menu is inventive, changing daily and
   offering many choices for all palates. We settled for a couple of apps
   and dove straight to the mains. The fish that evening was quite
   spectacular. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable navigating
   perfectly between locals and tourists.

                            Motor Supply Company

                            Motor Supply Company

                            Motor Supply Company

   You know me, I can't help but going to the back of the house, the heart
   of it all, the kitchen to catch a few pic of the chefs in action. They
   indulged me in their (always) small space and were really nice to let
   me snap a few shots while int he middle of a busy dinner service.

                               RiseBakeshop_3

   Rising and shining on Sunday was a tad slow but we had been told of the
   perfect antidote to a late night by visiting Rise Gourmet Bakeshop. I
   have long been an admirer of chef Sara Simmons who happened to be on
   the premises that morning at the same time we were. After a few "oh I
   follow you on Instagram!" "Me too!", we dove right in on our sausage
   and grits and breakfast sandwich. Feeling I needed something a bit
   healthy to balance out all the foods consumed so far, I also got their
   yogurt and granola. I still dream about it. Smooth, silky with a layer
   of perfectly tart lemon curd. Doesn't take much to make my day and this
   hit the stop. We also sampled (and took home) some of their other
   goodies. Couldn't possibly eat it all in one sitting. Needed some for
   the road back home, right?!!

                                    Park1

   At last, it was time to head back to Charleston but first, we made a
   pit stop at the Congaree national park on the way home. While some
   trails were closed because of the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, many
   remained accessible wand we ended up doing a 5 mile loop around the
   park. How we wished we had had the dogs with us. They would have been
   in heaven!
    The last time I had been in Columbia for more than a few hours was
   back in the 90s and while we drove through the town to visit family
   upstate or on our many back and forth to Birmingham a couple of years
   ago, neither of us had taken the time to be tourist in the town. For my
   husband it was nice to get back to his college grounds and show me
   around where his great grandfather would have resided, worked or
   walked. Being the food person that I am, I was really impressed by the
   care and dedication of the establishments we visited. Not to mention
   the quality of the food. If you ever travel through the state of South
   Carolina, I hope you will carve out a few hours to visit Columbia. You
   won't be disappointed.

DBO Home Tastemakers' Table

December 1, 2016

                      Cranberry Pomegranate Baked Brie

   Like most photographers, I "met" Dana Brandwein and Daniel Oates
   through the prop stylists I've worked with along the years. As a lover
   of beautiful props myself, I instantly found myself drawn to their line
   of ceramics, DBO Home.

                      Cranberry Pomegranate Baked Brie

   The funny thing is that on a photoshoot, we use plates and dishes for
   the photos, carefully clean them and put them away. We rarely eat from
   them. For some rare, one of a kind pieces, that makes sense. But not so
   for DBO Home's ceramics. I realized over the last few years working
   with them on sets that these were not only unique, handmade pieces but
   also functional and gorgeous on any tablescape. In any occasion.
   So when Dana emailed and asked if I were interested in doing a
   photoshoot with some of their pieces for their Tastemakers' Table
   feature on their site, it was basically a no brainer!

                                  Table Dbo

   I already had in mind the pieces and color palette I would love to work
   with. I picked dinner plates, platter and cheese board from their Burl
   series and mixed them with the delicate look of their Kashmir
   collection. A perfect balance of strong masculine dark grey with creamy
   accents of light blush and soft grey flowers. The color palette alone
   makes me happy. Seeing the pieces work together is completely
   thrilling.

                             Creamy Parsnip Soup

   I asked my friend and prop stylist Angela Hall to create a table around
   those pieces and left it completely to her to pick what she thought
   would make an inviting Friendsgiving table of sort. What she came up
   with made me giddy the first time she showed me. When we put it all
   together in my backyard, it simply looked amazing. Decked out, yet
   inviting. Much like DBO Home ceramics. You may feel like they are too
   pretty to eat from but trust me, they are strong and feel so good and
   practical in your hands.
   We gathered our favorite peeps around a holiday orientated menu and had
   a fantastic time enjoying the work that Dana and Daniel put into each
   of their pieces. Because they are handmade, each is a bit unique,
   slightly different from the rest. Shapes are irregular, details are
   strong. Much like everyday life. And I won't be waiting for another big
   dinner to use them again!
   You can see the pieces as sets and more photos from the table on the
   DBO Home site. They would make great additions to any table, any time
   of the year!

                             Creamy Parsnip Soup

   If you are interested in what we cooked and enjoyed that evening here
   is the menu with links to the recipes.
   Appetizer: Cranberry Pomegranate Baked Brie from my friend Liren at
   Kitchen Confidante
   First Course: Creamy Parsnip Soup With Pear and Walnuts from Marcus
   Samuelsson (minus the sun chokes)
   Main Course: Porchetta Spiced Turkey, Gaby's insane wild mushroom
   stuffing and a salad with roasted acorn squash, blue cheese and pecans
   with a coriander seed vinaigrette that I made up in my head.
   Dessert: Cardamom Poached Pears with Mascarpone cream (similar to this)

                           Porchetta Spiced Turkey

Rhubarb Tart With Cashew Frangipane

April 21, 2016

                                 Rhubarb Pie

   Workshop update: there are 3 spots available in the workshop I am
   teaching May 16-20th in Charleston. Right on the beach, with lots of
   hands on demos, practice times, all around great food and meals! All
   details HERE.
   I know better than to stock the fridge before a photoshoot but I could
   not resist the Spring produce in front of me at the market. I loaded
   up. Greens, radishes, okra, lettuces, herbs, rhubarb, eggs, milk,
   etc... I got worried on my way home that my food stylist would have a
   fit with that much valuable real estate taken up for her own groceries.
   On the other hand I know that if one eats as many vegetables as we do,
   the volume/space occupied in the fridge seems to be gone in a matter of
   a couple of days anyway.

                                    Eggs

   I almost panicked when I thought the rhubarb was lost in the deep dark
   spaces of the refrigerator, somehow fighting its way between the baby
   radishes and cherry tomatoes. As soon as rhubarb appears at the store I
   stock up, load up and cook up. It's probably one of my favorite things.
   It reminds me so much of home. My mom used to cook big pots of rhubarb
   compote or make rhubarb jam galore. I like to poach just until slightly
   soft but not mushy and add it to yogurt for a snack, make candied
   rhubarb or lots of rhubarb simple syrup for cocktails all through
   Spring and Summer.
   And then there is always a rhubarb tart or galette. This time I used
   some leftover puff pastry I had from a previous tart, made a cashew
   frangipane and layered some quick poached rhubarb batons (pieces) on
   top. Not too sweet and super buttery. The perfect little piece for an
   afternoon snack.

                                 Rhubarb Pie

Food Styling & Photography Workshop March 28th - April 1st 2017 in
Charleston, SC.

February 2, 2017

   Carrots-2 Everytime I do workshops, I get inspired by the people who
   come to attend the creative space we put together for them. The one I
   taught last week was no exception and as soon as we wrapped on a week
   of shooting and good eating, I texted my bestie, professional food
   stylist Tami Hardeman, to see if the was available to do another with
   me. See, we always try to carve out some time in the year to get
   together and shoot. She food styles, we compose, I shoot. It’s a time
   for us to challenge ourselves but also create together. We nourish both
   our souls and our bodies.
   And when she said “yes”, she just about made my day. We both have busy
   schedules that don’t often match so finding a week to be together and
   share with others what we know and love is important to us. “Choose a
   job you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life”
   Confucius said. And we believe that.
   She is an amazing food stylist, with great art directorial skills in my
   opinion, and she always makes me a better photographer. My goal when we
   are on set is to push my own creativity and skills to show off hers.
   So, that’s why I am excited to announce that we are holding a creative
   food styling and photography workshop March 28th-April 1st in
   Charleston, SC. (registration open HERE)
   During the three days of workshop (first and last day being your travel
   days), we will do lots of hands on demos showing you our process and
   guiding you through your own mini photoshoots. While we like to shoot
   “pretty foods”, we also know the challenges faced by many of you trying
   to shoot “brown foods” or “flat foods” and will guide you through those
   challenges. She will share her best tips and techniques about food
   styling and I will share mine about choosing the right lens for the
   food, how to work the light to your advantage, working camera angles
   and settings. Together we will talk you through picking the best props
   and composition to showcase your food.
   We aim to create a collaborative environment where you are free to
   expand upon your usual repertoire or dig deeper into the vibe you like.
   While we love to push ourselves beyond our own comfort zone, we also
   want to foster the style and mood you like or help you get happy
   venturing out to new territory. We will provide you with the tools and
   knowledge to do over three fun and energizing days.
   Because we believe in the beauty of imperfections, we will show you how
   to create real life images not perfect ones, images that let the food
   shine and help you tell a story. If you have taken workshops with me
   before, this one is the perfect extension to those. A workshop v2 if
   you like. If this is the first time you are considering a workshop with
   us, fear not, we will take every hands on demo from a to z as far as
   process goes and make “rounds” when you are shooting to offer help and
   guidance. Oh and we are planning a photoshoot on the beach where we
   hope to have everyone contributing their own creativity. (the house we
   will be staying in as a group is just a few steps from the ocean).
   Follow this link for the registration page.
   Here are the details:
   3 days of photography, composition, food styling hands on demo and
   photoshoots with our guidance and help March 28th - April 1st (March
   28th being your arrival day and April 1st being your departure day)
   4 nights accommodations on the beach of Isle Of Palms
   Breakfasts, lunches and dinners
   Refreshments and snacks
   Fee is $1875, early bird registration through February 28th, then $2100
   (does not include travel fares to and from workshop)
   Most rooms are shared - there is opportunity for single rooms on a
   first sign up basis
   Workshop is limited to 8 people.
   There will be no refunds for this workshop – please know you can attend
   before registering.

A weekend in Columbia, South Carolina...or 72 hours of great food and
culture!

January 17, 2017

                                  Columbia

   Back in late November (Halloween weekend actually), I traveled to
   Columbia, South Carolina, on assignment for Garden&Gun magazine and the
   Columbia Midlands Authority for 72 hours to explore and venture around
   the city for their upcoming feature in this month's issue. It was a
   packed trip of food and cultural outings but I had the best partner in
   crime. My husband. Sending a French to the state capital is one thing,
   but armed with her best weapon, a Charleston born and bred husband who
   attended college there and whose great grand father was governor of
   South Carolina and thus resided in the Capital, was probably the most
   fun way to explore a city. Lots of walking around, driving around,
   eating everything and asking all the questions...

                             Spotted Salamander

   We got to Columbia on time for a late lunch at The Spotted Salamander
   in the historic district. Sweet little spot with an extra outdoor space
   and friendly staff. Missed their renowned deviled eggs as they were not
   making them that weekend but everything else we ordered (crisp pork
   belly salad and the hot turkey sandwich) was spot on.

   Hampton-Preston House
   I am more of a nibbler/grazer than a sit down lunch or dinner gal so
   after what felt to me like a bigger meal than I do most days, we
   decided to walk the historic district and hopefully catch up on a house
   visit before they'd close for the day. We got right on time to catch up
   the last guided tour of the Hampton Preston House and stole a few extra
   moments walking the grounds before heading back to our hotel (perfectly
   located to boot...)

                                  Warmouth

   Dinner was at The Warmouth. A cool little place located in a revamped
   car garage. It was warm enough to sit on the back patio which was nice
   and quiet. While I've had many a cheese and charcuterie boards in my
   life, I remain attracted to those boasting house made cured meats and
   terrines. The Warmouth charcuterie board was served with various
   pickles and mustard. The pickled pineapple was a revelation. Must
   duplicate soon!

                                  Bourbon_3

   The bustle outside and inside of Bourbon on Main street lured us in for
   a nightcap and satisfied our thirst for a couple of cocktails and
   bourbons and some chit chat at the bar with other patrons.

                                  Bourbon_2

   Their bourbon list is extensive and the cocktails creative. It also
   serves a late food/nibbles menu.

                               The Wired Goat

   Our Saturday started at The Wired Goat Cafe. Really cool breakfast
   place offering a wide variety of coffees and coffee drinks, breakfast
   sandwiches and waffles. Come early because the line can get quite long
   as it is a favorite with the locals. Don't miss the oak smoked sea salt
   and honey latte. I still have dreams about it. All their breads and
   baked goods are made on the premises daily which is definitely a plus
   in my book.

                              SodaCityMarket_1

   If you've have been following me for a while you know how much I love
   farmers market. Nothing better to get the beat of a city. The Soda City
   Market that occupies much of Main street on Saturdays is a great mix of
   artists, food vendors and farmers. Lots of food trucks and plenty of
   street music at every corner.

                              SodaCityMarket_2

                                Museum Of Art

   To break away from the bustle of the market, we crossed the street and
   headed inside the Columbia Museum of Art. The permanent exhibit is
   really well aid out and offers way more than just a glimpse into the
   history of the arts. I didn't expect to see so much and we ended
   staying a good couple of hours. By the time we were done, a faint
   rumbling could be heard in our stomachs. Time to eat again...!

                                Museum Of Art

                              Southern Belly_3

   I don't know what it is with French peeps and barbecue but we love it.
   And can't get enough of it. So I was really looking forward to our
   lunch stop at Southern Belly. While the inside is cozy and funky at the
   same time, we couldn't resist grabbing a table outside on such a
   gorgeous day. We got two of their famous sandwiches, the Django and the
   Castro and devoured them with reckless abandon. A part of my brain
   wanted to order a couple more "for the road" but it wasn't time to head
   back to Charleston quite yet..

                              Southern Belly_2

   We drove around town a bit and even caught the USC marching band
   rehearsing before their game that evening. Back in the 70s my husband
   was in the same marching band so it was a really cool trip down memory
   lane. Just from the look in his eyes, I knew that one little moment had
   made the entire trip for him. I mean, tagging along with a photographer
   on an eating and cultural discovery mission is nice but sometimes
   disjointed for him!

                                State Museum

   From our hotel, we walked down to the State Museum which we had both
   visited before a few times but there were a couple of things we wanted
   to see. I really wanted to give a long at their new telescopes exhibit
   and hopefully catch a glimpse of the skies through their major one and
   my husband wanted to see the Anderson car that was built to rival
   (never did but what a beauty!) the Ford back in the days and designed
   and built in South Carolina by a family member. The museum gives a
   thorough history of the South throughout the years, and f you have
   kids, there are tons of various exhibits and activities for them.

                            Motor Supply Company

   A quick nap at the hotel and we were magically hungry again! Our next
   stop was walking distance from the hotel on Gervais street, The Motor
   Supply Company. What an evening! Josh, the bartender is a master at his
   craft, truly. We started with one of the cocktails on the menu and soon
   we were talking about old fashioned drinks, the resurgence of vermouth
   based cocktails and before we knew it, we had a couple more before our
   meal. And a couple afterwards. Good thing we only had to cross the
   street back to our room!! The menu is inventive, changing daily and
   offering many choices for all palates. We settled for a couple of apps
   and dove straight to the mains. The fish that evening was quite
   spectacular. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable navigating
   perfectly between locals and tourists.

                            Motor Supply Company

                            Motor Supply Company

                            Motor Supply Company

   You know me, I can't help but going to the back of the house, the heart
   of it all, the kitchen to catch a few pic of the chefs in action. They
   indulged me in their (always) small space and were really nice to let
   me snap a few shots while int he middle of a busy dinner service.

                               RiseBakeshop_3

   Rising and shining on Sunday was a tad slow but we had been told of the
   perfect antidote to a late night by visiting Rise Gourmet Bakeshop. I
   have long been an admirer of chef Sara Simmons who happened to be on
   the premises that morning at the same time we were. After a few "oh I
   follow you on Instagram!" "Me too!", we dove right in on our sausage
   and grits and breakfast sandwich. Feeling I needed something a bit
   healthy to balance out all the foods consumed so far, I also got their
   yogurt and granola. I still dream about it. Smooth, silky with a layer
   of perfectly tart lemon curd. Doesn't take much to make my day and this
   hit the stop. We also sampled (and took home) some of their other
   goodies. Couldn't possibly eat it all in one sitting. Needed some for
   the road back home, right?!!

                                    Park1

   At last, it was time to head back to Charleston but first, we made a
   pit stop at the Congaree national park on the way home. While some
   trails were closed because of the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, many
   remained accessible wand we ended up doing a 5 mile loop around the
   park. How we wished we had had the dogs with us. They would have been
   in heaven!
    The last time I had been in Columbia for more than a few hours was
   back in the 90s and while we drove through the town to visit family
   upstate or on our many back and forth to Birmingham a couple of years
   ago, neither of us had taken the time to be tourist in the town. For my
   husband it was nice to get back to his college grounds and show me
   around where his great grandfather would have resided, worked or
   walked. Being the food person that I am, I was really impressed by the
   care and dedication of the establishments we visited. Not to mention
   the quality of the food. If you ever travel through the state of South
   Carolina, I hope you will carve out a few hours to visit Columbia. You
   won't be disappointed.

DBO Home Tastemakers' Table

December 1, 2016

                      Cranberry Pomegranate Baked Brie

   Like most photographers, I "met" Dana Brandwein and Daniel Oates
   through the prop stylists I've worked with along the years. As a lover
   of beautiful props myself, I instantly found myself drawn to their line
   of ceramics, DBO Home.

                      Cranberry Pomegranate Baked Brie

   The funny thing is that on a photoshoot, we use plates and dishes for
   the photos, carefully clean them and put them away. We rarely eat from
   them. For some rare, one of a kind pieces, that makes sense. But not so
   for DBO Home's ceramics. I realized over the last few years working
   with them on sets that these were not only unique, handmade pieces but
   also functional and gorgeous on any tablescape. In any occasion.
   So when Dana emailed and asked if I were interested in doing a
   photoshoot with some of their pieces for their Tastemakers' Table
   feature on their site, it was basically a no brainer!

                                  Table Dbo

   I already had in mind the pieces and color palette I would love to work
   with. I picked dinner plates, platter and cheese board from their Burl
   series and mixed them with the delicate look of their Kashmir
   collection. A perfect balance of strong masculine dark grey with creamy
   accents of light blush and soft grey flowers. The color palette alone
   makes me happy. Seeing the pieces work together is completely
   thrilling.

   I asked my friend and prop stylist Angela Hall to create a table around
   those pieces and left it completely to her to pick what she thought
   would make an inviting Friendsgiving table of sort. What she came up
   with made me giddy the first time she showed me. When we put it all
   together in my backyard, it simply looked amazing. Decked out, yet
   inviting. Much like DBO Home ceramics. You may feel like they are too
   pretty to eat from but trust me, they are strong and feel so good and
   practical in your hands.
   We gathered our favorite peeps around a holiday orientated menu and had
   a fantastic time enjoying the work that Dana and Daniel put into each
   of their pieces. Because they are handmade, each is a bit unique,
   slightly different from the rest. Shapes are irregular, details are
   strong. Much like everyday life. And I won't be waiting for another big
   dinner to use them again!
   You can see the pieces as sets and more photos from the table on the
   DBO Home site. They would make great additions to any table, any time
   of the year!

   If you are interested in what we cooked and enjoyed that evening here
   is the menu with links to the recipes.
   Appetizer: Cranberry Pomegranate Baked Brie from my friend Liren at
   Kitchen Confidante
   First Course: Creamy Parsnip Soup With Pear and Walnuts from Marcus
   Samuelsson (minus the sun chokes)
   Main Course: Porchetta Spiced Turkey, Gaby's insane wild mushroom
   stuffing and a salad with roasted acorn squash, blue cheese and pecans
   with a coriander seed vinaigrette that I made up in my head.
   Dessert: Cardamom Poached Pears with Mascarpone cream (similar to this)

          What a stunning table! I love that it is beautiful but
          approachable. Sometimes you see a beautifully set table and
          you're nervous to sit down to eat because you're afraid you'll
          mess it up. But that table is so warm and inviting. The menu is
          delicious, I think I'll make the baked brie this weekend and
          have some friends over for movie night to share it.
