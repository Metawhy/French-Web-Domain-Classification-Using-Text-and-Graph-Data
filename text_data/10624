What our community says about us

   Thanks to the transnational PSAP contact database managed by EENA, we
   have been able to help those that have faced emergencies outside
   Lithuania. We are proud of this partnership that results in saving
   lives.
   Tadas MaroscikasLithuanian Emergency Response Centre

   Integrating brand-new technology, like drones, into emergency response
   means we first have to understand how this technology will be used by
   public safety entities; learning about integration, deployment,
   tactical approach, data capturing and sharing, to best practices. EENA
   and DJI have been working on these questions for over two years to help
   educate and set standards.
   Romeo DurscherDJI

   Working with EENA has been instrumental in the adoption of improved
   location determination information from mobile devices in Europe;
   today’s lives are being saved thanks to both the advocacy and
   networking opportunities that EENA provides.
