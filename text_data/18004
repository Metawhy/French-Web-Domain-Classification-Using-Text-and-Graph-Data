         DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) lets an organization take
   responsibility for a message that is in transit.  The organization is a
   handler of the message, either as its originator or as an intermediary.
      Their reputation is the basis for evaluating whether to trust the
      message for further handling, such as delivery. Technically DKIM
       provides a method for validating a domain name identity that is
       associated with a message through cryptographic authentication.

                                Introduction

      DKIM attaches a new domain name identifier to a message and uses
    cryptographic techniques to validate authorization for its presence.
    The identifier is independent of any other identifier in the message,
                      such in the author's From: field.

    The first version of DKIM synthesized and enhanced Yahoo!'s DomanKeys
   and Cisco's Identified Internet Mail specifications. It was the result
    of a year-long collaboration among numerous industry players, during
   2005, to develop an open-standard e-mail authentication specification.
         Participants included Alt-N Technologies, AOL, Brandenburg
     InternetWorking, Cisco, EarthLink, IBM, Microsoft, PGP Corporation,
   Sendmail, StrongMail Systems, Tumbleweed, VeriSign and Yahoo!. The team
   produced the initial specification and several implementations. It then
      submitted the work to the IETF for further enhancement and formal
                              standardization.

          The result is a set of IETF specifications and supporting
                               documentation.
