   In many areas of computing, techniques ranging from testing, formal
   modeling to full-blown verification have been successfully used to help
   programmers create reliable systems. For example, in processor
   development, automated theorem proving uncovers deep bugs in designs
   before they become costly errors in silicon; avionics developers use
   program analysis to verify critical safety properties of the embedded
   software running on airplanes; and operating system vendors have
   successfully used model checking to eliminate entire classes of bugs in
   device drivers. More recently, program verification and mechanization,
   based on proof assistants such as Coq or Isabelle have been intensively
   studied yielding very impressive results and highly reliable software
   that do exactly conform to their formal specification.

   Surprisingly, until recently, data intensive management systems and
   applications and more generally, the data realm, have largely resisted
   analysis using formal techniques. Such a situation is quite astonishing
   as, with the advent of internet, data intensive applications are being
   used in various sensitive domains in which data integration and
   exchange preserving privacy and/or data reliability are critical.

   Datacert interacts with the DeepSpec Expedition project.

   The aim is to certify and verify, as well, data intensive systems with
   the Coq proof assistant . The project is divided into three main lines:
     * certified SQL query evaluation,
     * deep specification of a minimal realistic transactional data engine
     * and deep specification of privacy aware data integration and
       exchange.

   The project is co-located between CRIStAL at Lille, LIRIS at Lyon and
   and LRI at Orsay.
