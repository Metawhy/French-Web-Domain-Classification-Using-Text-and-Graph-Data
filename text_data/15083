About the School

   The School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science was formed in
   1997 by the merger of the Department of Computer Science and of the
   Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The School of EECS
   is the University of Ottawa's centre for research and teaching in all
   areas related to computing, computers and communications. This
   interdisciplinary school combines four cutting-edge programs:
   electrical engineering, software engineering, computer engineering and
   computer science. Having these closely-related programs joined in one
   academic unit means that our students benefit from professors with
   interdisciplinary knowledge gained from teaching in one or more of the
   four programs. The School of EECS also offers degrees in computing to
   several other Faculties.

   Advanced research, carried out in the School of EECS's fifteen research
   areas, is funded by grants and contracts in the millions of dollars.
   The School, located in one of Canada's largest high-technology centres,
   enjoys excellent relationships with many local companies.

   In our four major degree programs we have more than 775 undergraduate
   students, many of them in co-operative education. Over 400 graduate
   students work on advanced degrees in Computer Science and in Electrical
   and Computer Engineering.

Research

   The School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science offers a
   vibrant research environment where the traditional disciplines of
   electronics, computer and software engineering and computer science
   come together to create unique synergy.

   With over 70 researchers and over 750 graduate students working in many
   laboratories and groups, the School of EECS has built strong
   connections with local industry which results in a dynamic environment
   of collaboration and practical impact.

   Opportunities for joint research exist at all levels, from exploratory
   research to contract research, from sponsoring a student to supporting
   a dedicated project, and many variations in between. University-based
   research can be very cost-effective for your company and in most cases
   your support can be used to leverage additional grants from government
   agencies resulting in a multiplying effect.

   Algorithms

   Loosely speaking, an algorithm is a formally defined, finite procedure
   to solve a problem in a finite number of steps. Algorithms are what
   make it possible for computers to solve problems. They are at the very
   heart of computer science and play a key role in most of its areas.
   Typical algorithm problems include the following: Is there a
   constructive solution to a given problem? Is there an efficient
   constructive solution to a given problem (minimizing one or several
   factors)? How efficient is a given constructive solution? Is it
   optimal? Is there a good heuristic for a given problem?

   The algorithm team works on many different aspects of these questions,
   developing algorithms to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization
   problems, algorithms based on graphical representations, algorithms
   applied to ad hoc and sensor networks, network protocol algorithms,
   ordered sets manipulation and drawing, algorithms for covering arrays
   used in software testing, algorithms for mobile agents and algorithms
   for mobile robots.

   Our team’s research can be applied to a wide variety of topics,
   including design of reliable communication networks, covering schemes
   for software testing, robotic routing, message routing in wireless
   networks, design, modelling, analysis and performance evaluation of
   computer communication network, circuit board production, automatic
   rendering of complex and large graphs, and construction of test suites
   for interaction testing.

   Bioinformatics and biomedical engineering

   Biomedical engineering comprises several fields of research, including
   bioinformatics, medical imaging, physiological signal processing and
   medical informatics. Bioinformatics is a relatively new field of
   research that applies mathematical and computer science theories to
   organized models and help understand fundamental biological and
   biomedical problems.

   Biomedical engineering and bioinformatics create new knowledge from the
   molecular level to the systems level. This field of engineering also
   focuses on developing approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat medical
   conditions. Our major research efforts in bioinformatics include
   alignment of molecular sequences, gene finding, genome assembly,
   protein structure prediction, protein-protein interactions and the
   modelling of evolution.

   Broadband networks

   With the tremendous increase in traffic over the Internet, researchers
   started to use optical fibres to provide high capacity communication
   links with much improved efficiency. More recently, optical networks
   researchers have introduced wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), the
   technology of transmitting multiple data streams independently on a
   single fibre using different light wavelengths, to increase the network
   capacity many times over. In addition, “burst switching,” sharing the
   bandwidth in the time domain using very fast switches, has been
   proposed. However, these approaches introduce several challenging
   issues related to light path establishment and control, network
   architecture, optical switch architecture, routing and wavelength and
   time-slot assignment, optical network survivability, routing algorithms
   and protocols, network security and network management. Network access
   cost remains the big challenge for optical networks end users,
   stimulating research in the area of passive optical networks (PON),
   Ethernet PON and WDM-PON.

   Applications of broadband networks and broadband Internet include
   multimedia communications, IP-telephony, video teleconferencing,
   e-commerce, web services and collaborative applications.

   Distributed computing and computer architectures

   “Distributed systems” is a generic term used to indicate any system
   that is composed of a collection of communicating computational
   devices, and “distributed computing” refers to computability and
   complexity issues in such environments. The distributed computing and
   systems team is quite diverse and complementary, and covers a wide
   spectrum of aspects of distributed computing and systems, from theory
   to application, including algorithm design, simulation, networks,
   architectures and management. Our research focuses on a variety of
   distributed environments (wired, wireless, ad hoc, mobile,
   peer-to-peer, self-organized). In these environments our team is
   interested in various issues, among them design, efficiency, fault
   tolerance, quality of service, communication software reliability,
   safety and security.

   Electromagnetism, radio-frequencies and microwaves

   All physical electrical devices involve the interaction of
   electro-magnetic fields. The higher the frequency at which a device
   operates, the smaller the wavelength of the electromagnetic fields
   involved and the larger the devices are relative to a wavelength. Also,
   the electromagnetic phenomena are used in different ways than at lower
   frequencies. Thus, we need to develop in-depth efficient circuit
   modelling tools and measurement techniques specifically suited to the
   components that make terrestrial wireless, satellite, and optical
   communications networks possible. This includes developing advanced
   electro-magnetic and circuit simulation CAD tools that help with the
   design, simulation and optimization of devices and components for use
   in communication systems.

   Microwave equipment such as cellular phones, cordless computer
   peripherals, indoor and outdoor security systems, positioning systems
   for cars and airplanes, satellite links and more is now part of our
   daily life. RF/microwave and optical devices are also used in
   industrial production lines, medical technologies and transport
   systems. Currently, demands for smaller size and weight, as well as
   accessibility to services such as text messaging, email, Internet and
   photo and video cameras, to name a few, are creating new challenges for
   RF/microwave engineers. Integrating so many different features in a
   single device means multi-task design, requiring experienced designers
   with both theoretical and experimental technical skills.

   Information management and data mining

   The field of information management and data mining focuses on the
   collection, management and intelligent analysis of large-scale data
   repositories. Our research aims to help realize the dream of making
   data, and the associated knowledge hidden within, available anywhere,
   anytime and in any possible format. We are studying best practices
   concerning organization of and control over the structure, processing
   and delivery of information, especially within an e-commerce framework.
   Furthermore, our research aims to extract useful knowledge from these
   sources, by developing new techniques to seamlessly mine complex
   databases.

   This research has applications in a variety of areas, including
   e-commerce, health care systems management, anthropometry, and
   bioinformatics, among many others. Our research includes the simulation
   of a complete data warehouse at a major teaching hospital and three
   major health care processes. We are also developing a location-aware
   data management and mining system, that aid users by providing them
   with personalized recommendations as they travel.

   Multimedia and interactive virtual environments

   Multimedia communications deals with the representation, storage,
   retrieval and dissemination of information that is expressed in
   multiple media, such as text, voice, graphics, audio, video, haptics
   and 3D virtual worlds. Collaborative multimedia communications refers
   to multimedia which features collaborative work among several
   participants who are concurrently engaged in a multimedia session. A
   virtual environment is an artificial environment created with computer
   hardware and software and presented to the user in such a way that it
   appears and feels like a real environment.

   These environments are widely used by major companies (IBM, CISCO) for
   selling their products. Haptics refers to the hardware/software
   representation and electronic transmission of the feeling of human
   touch.

   The potential of these technologies is significant. They have been
   explored in contexts as diverse as modelling and animation, geophysical
   analysis, dentistry training, virtual museums, assembly planning, mine
   design, surgical simulation, design evaluation, control of scientific
   instruments, gaming, and robotic simulation and manipulation in
   hazardous environments.

   Privacy and security

   The Internet can be a dangerous place where malicious software, denial
   of service, phishing, credit card theft, identity theft and other
   attacks threaten the wellbeing and productivity of many in society.
   Other electronic networks — including voice/data networks (such as
   cellphone and wireless ad hoc nets), text networks, and cloud
   environments — are not much better. The goal of privacy and security
   research is to create environments in which it is safe for people to
   work and play. Specific applications include e-commerce, e-business,
   online gaming, healthcare, and corporate and government networks.

   This research area involves a number of different sub-disciplines,
   including mathematics, communications protocols, distributed systems,
   software development, specification and formal design, model checking
   and theorem proving, verification, validation and testing, and
   hardware/firmware design. It seeks to combine some of these
   sub-disciplines in ways that allow secure and private interaction over
   electronic and wireless networks.

   Robotics, machine vision and autonomous systems

   Robotics has often been described as the intelligent connection of
   perception to action. Robot actuators provide the action function. A
   variety of sensors provide the perception capability. Computational
   intelligence is needed for a framework to coordinate the perception and
   action capabilities in a meaningful way. Machine vision is one of the
   most powerful perception mechanisms. It involves extracting,
   characterizing and interpreting information from images in order to
   identify or describe objects in the environment. Autonomous robot
   systems are designed to operate in uncertain and highly dynamical
   environments.

   Software engineering

   Software engineering aims at improving software qualities such as
   reliability, safety, security and usability. It also aims to reduce
   cost and time-to-market in the context of both new system development
   and maintenance of existing software systems. Our software engineering
   faculty members concentrate on several types of software systems,
   including telecommunication systems, software engineering tools,
   e-commerce systems and other distributed web-based applications. Their
   interests cover the entire development process, from requirements to
   testing and deployment. They investigate new methodologies and evolving
   best practices in software engineering, and work to apply their
   research results by collaborating with tool developers, participating
   in developing international standards, using the methodologies in
   graduate and undergraduate education and working directly with
   companies that develop software.

   Research applications include improved software products, new software
   engineering tools and improved software development processes, which
   can be applied in all industries and all types of software used in
   industries.

   Text analysis and machine learning

   Text analysis and machine learning covers the research field known as
   knowledge-based systems. Some of the issues it tackles include knowing
   if we have sufficient knowledge to describe and solve a given task,
   representing knowledge in a manner adequate to the task in which it is
   to be used, acquiring and learning knowledge from examples, analyzing
   and understanding a variety of knowledge sources, particularly in the
   form of documents and texts expressed in languages such as English, and
   planning and organizing knowledge into actionable units (agents) that
   can tackle problems autonomously.

   In addition to the applications mentioned above, this research area has
   applications in a variety of other areas (e.g. medicine, computer
   security, management, digital games, fashion). For instance, we work on
   a system that will assist Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario
   emergency room staff to predict the severity of asthma attacks in
   patients. In another application, we investigate inter-relationships
   between different body measurements to better understand the typical
   consumer, from a virtual tailor’s perspective.
