Thank You


   Well, that was fun.

   Also exhausting, unpredictable, warm and a little crazy at times. When
   we first decided to embark on this journey, we could never have
   anticipated the magnitude of what WordCamp Europe 2013 came to be.

   This is not the re-cap post, which we will get to next week, just a
   very quick and hardly sufficient way to thank all for organising,
   volunteering, speaking, sponsoring, and attending what we hope was the
   beginning of a tradition. We are still balancing budgets, and gathering
   feedback (including incriminating pictures, yes), and will publish a
   complete and detailed re-cap in the next few days.

   We are, more than ever, honoured, delighted and humbled by the
   incredible spirit of the WordPress community.

   Thank you.

   Now that the event is over, and the excitement and exhaustion levels
   have come back to more normal values, we‚Äôve started gathering feedback
   about WordCamp Europe 2013, to try and see if it was well received.
   From the list below, it certainly looks that way! It is very curious to
   read about the details that each author noted, despite the fact that
   we‚Äôve lived the event in pretty much the same way.

   A few notes:
     * For now we‚Äôre just listing actual blog posts, no image galleries
       yet
     * If you wrote a blog post that‚Äôs not on this list, please link to it
       in the comments
     * If you plan on writing one, same thing. Also publish it on Twitter
       if you can, using the #wceu hashtag
     * The list is in no particular order of chronology, language or
       region

   And now, without further delay, we are very proud to present: The

Thank You Haboes!

   Haboes means ‚Äúcheers‚Äù and that‚Äôs exactly what we want to say, for
   stepping up as a Silver Sponsor. We are very honored to have such
   strong local support from dutch WordPress specialists.

     Let‚Äôs raise our glasses! Indeed, even at this very moment of the
     day, because we always want to cheer on the best possible outcome
     and with a satisfied customer. It is also the essence why the
     company is called Haboes, since the very simple reason that the name
     of the company itself means cheers.

     The organizational structure of our company has few layers and we
     work with objectives that are crystal clear for everyone. The
     concept of Haboes is designed to compete most effectively in the
     ever-changing world of the Internet. Straight from the inner city of
     Amsterdam we use innovation and new technologies to provide new ways
     for our customers. Those new ways should, in our view, always be
     based on WordPress.

Behind the Scenes at Smashing Magazine

   Smashing Magazine started in September 2006 as an almost unstyled
   WordPress-powered blog. Over the course of years, a simple blog evolved
   into a professional online publication with a thorough editorial
   process and numerous quality reviews. How did it happen? What lessons
   were learned along the way? In this talk, Vitaly Friedman, co-founder
   and editor-in-chief of Smashing Magazine, will be speaking about the
   experiences, mistakes and failures of Smashing Magazine and how
   recovering from them helped make the magazine better, stronger and more
   successful.
