 About me

   I am a CNRS senior researcher (Directeur de recherche) located at IRIF,
   University Paris Diderot. I am interested in understanding fundamental
   aspects of computation under uncertainty, especially those that relate
   to computer science or biology. In previous years I studied theoretical
   aspects of distributed computing, focusing on identifying connections
   between the local and global scales of information. Recently, I have
   become particularly intrigued with applying techniques from the theory
   of algorithms in order to uncover computational aspects that are
   inherent to biological ensembles.  Questions I am interested in are,
   for example, how do aspects such as noise or competition affect the
   ability of groups to effectively perform basic collective tasks. Aiming
   to connect to biological contexts I collaborate with experimental
   biologists, and together we develop new methodologies for integrating
   algorithmic insights with empirical data. The main biology labs I
   currently work with focus on ants and bats. My research on this
   algorithmic biology perspective is supported by an ERC Consolidator
   grant (May 2015 - April 2021).

   My extracurricular interests include North Indian Classical music. I am
   a senior tabla disciple of Pandit Nayan Ghosh.
