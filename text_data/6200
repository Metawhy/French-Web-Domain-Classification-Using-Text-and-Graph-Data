So, what's in it for you?

   We’re a team of makers, techies, adventurers – and some gamers too.
   We’re kids of all ages, and love what we do. Challenging work, a smart
   team, and the opportunity to impact tens of millions of users with your
   work.

   But there's more: flexible working hours, free healthy lunch at our
   central Amsterdam office and a refreshing company culture are just a
   couple of the other reasons. Come play!

Our culture

   Play is how we learn 🚲
   Every day we try new things and learn by doing. In an environment where
   it’s ok not to get it right the first time. And we have some fun along
   the way.

   We play fair 🌸
   We treat players, game developers and each other the way we'd like to
   be treated ourselves.

   With freedom comes responsibility 🌏
   Great work thrives in freedom. And freedom comes with the
   responsibility to do great work. We take ownership over time and tools
   and share learnings as we go.

   We get things done 💪🏾
   We're hackers and entrepreneurs that love to do great things in small
   teams.

   We surround ourselves with a diverse group of people 🌈
   Poki is a platform where technology, data and design come together.
   Collaborate with different personalities from all sorts of
   nationalities.

   We're growing 🚀
   We now reach 30 million monthly active users and we're growing to 100
   million and beyond. New challenges and new opportunities – every single
   day.

   We learn from the best 🔭
   We believe in smart people hiring smarter people. It's how we grow,
   learn and excel.

Our perks

     * Professional growth
       When you grow, we grow. We encourage and support attending
       international conferences, events, trainings, workshops, and more.
     * Flexible work arrangements
       We trust you to manage your productivity. So we don’t have set
       working hours or a specific remote work policy. It’s up to you to
       know how and where you do your best work.
     * Top-notch tools
       Tackling hard challenges is a little easier with your preferred
       choice of laptop, display, and other hardware. Looking to game?
       We’ve got a complete setup, including our very own arcade game,
       Zoi.

     * The best office in Amsterdam
       Work and play in our bright office right on the Spui. It’s got
       great views and is just a 10 minute walk from central station.
     * Free food and an open fridge
       We come together to eat a tasty, healthy lunch together every day.
       Cereal, fruit, afternoon snacks, a well stocked fridge, and a hard
       working coffee machine keep us energized throughout the rest of the
       day.
