   and some unique flavour - delicous. Favorite track: Swebeach.

   Calum Elliott Great shoegaze, not as diverse as the first album
   however, which I highly recommend. Was a shame to lose both male and
   female vocals but there are still 3 or 4 outstanding tracks here
   Favorite track: Swebeach.

   Lahet Kherev Sometimes you need an amazingly crafted Swedegaze pop
   album, and sometimes that album will kick in your door, shower you with
   kisses, then proceed to back its time capsule steamroller over your
   face. Set your picnic blanket ablaze. Eat flowers while skydiving.
   Sleep beneath the waterfall. Absolutely gorgeous. Favorite track:
   Daylight.

   and some unique flavour - delicous. Favorite track: Swebeach.

   Calum Elliott Great shoegaze, not as diverse as the first album
   however, which I highly recommend. Was a shame to lose both male and
   female vocals but there are still 3 or 4 outstanding tracks here
   Favorite track: Swebeach.

   Lahet Kherev Sometimes you need an amazingly crafted Swedegaze pop
   album, and sometimes that album will kick in your door, shower you with
   kisses, then proceed to back its time capsule steamroller over your
   face. Set your picnic blanket ablaze. Eat flowers while skydiving.
   Sleep beneath the waterfall. Absolutely gorgeous. Favorite track:
   Daylight.
