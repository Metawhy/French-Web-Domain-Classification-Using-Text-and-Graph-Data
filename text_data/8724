Geo Art

   [geo%2Bart.png]
   Download isometric dot grid paper. Kids connect dots to create
   polygons, overlapping their lines to create a unique design. When
   they're finished they color in their shapes. How many different
   polygons can they find within their design?

Fishing for Angles

   [angle%2Bfish.jpg]
   Kids construct a fish out of a circle, using a protractor to create its
   mouth (make sure each kid creates a different angle). They cut out the
   angle and the chunk of paper becomes the caudal fin (or tail fin).
   Game: All of the fish get magnets put on them. For a fishing pole, use
   a stick with yarn and a magnet attached to the end. Kids go fishing for
   angles! When they catch a fish, they use a protractor and figure out
   the angle of its mouth. They write down the type of fish they caught
   (ex: 30 degree angle). They keep their fish. If they can't figure out
   the angle, they throw their fish back! Whoever has the most fish wins!
