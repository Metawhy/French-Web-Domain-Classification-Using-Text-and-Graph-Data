Welcome

   Welcome to the home of the 2016 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, to be held
   in San Francisco, USA, on June 26th - July 1st, 2016.

   News: SIGMOD 2016 already hit a new record of over 1000 registered
   people!

   Awards pictures can be found here.

   The Conference. The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading
   international forum for database researchers, practitioners,
   developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to
   exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a
   fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks,
   tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session
   to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet
   companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with
   representatives from leading companies.

   San Francisco. A unique bridge, cable cars, a sparkling bay, a famous
   prison, steep streets with beautiful Victorian houses - so many things
   make San Francisco one of the world's greatest cities to visit. Located
   in the Bay Area along the Northern California coast, many attractions
   beyond those in the city can be easily reached: world-famous wine
   country, including Napa and Sonoma Valley, beautiful beaches, or
   world's largest trees and wonderful hikes in close National Parks.

   The Hyatt Regency. The conference itself will be held in the Hyatt
   Regency Hotel, located in the financial district in downtown San
   Francisco. The hotel is very conveniently located close to many
   activities and landmarks, making this the ideal spot not only for an
   exciting conference but also for exploring the area.

   Social events. The conference banquet will be held at the California
   Academy of Sciences. The California Academy of Sciences is a
   Planetarium, Aquarium & Natural History Museum under a Living Roof in
   San Francisco, and it is among the largest museums of natural history
   in the world, housing over 26 million specimens.

   Salesforce is excited to host an Evening at the Exploratorium, Tuesday,
   June 28th from 7:00-9:30pm for all SIGMOD attendees. Join us for a
   night of networking, drinks, heavy apps, and entertainment in the East
   Gallery overlooking the San Francisco Bay. Must register and bring your
   badge for entry.

   Register for the conference and book your stay.
   Please note that the Hyatt Regency hotel rooms have all been reserved.
   You can find a list of close by hotels here.
