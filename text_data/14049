Immortalize your keepsake on the Moon

Accepting orders for lunar delivery on Astrobotic's mission to the moon

   Astrobotic is now accepting small mementos for inclusion on its first
   mission to the Moon. These keepsakes will be stored on the Moon for
   centuries to come.

   This is your unique opportunity to commemorate your graduation,
   holiday, wedding, child's birth, or loved one's memory with a lasting
   symbol we will carry on our lunar lander. Life's most meaningful
   moments can be forever linked with the Moon in the night sky.

Step one

Order your space

Select the moon capsule that's just right for you

   The Moon Capsule protects your keepsake in flight and on the lunar
   surface. All of the Moon Capsules on a flight will be integrated into a
   single Moon Pod on the Peregrine lunar lander.

   Select the size of Moon Capsule that is just right for your item on the
   MoonBox Kit order page.

   Remember that no hazardous materials or volatile items can be sent as
   MoonBox!

Astrobotic integrates your keepsake into the moon pod

   Place your keepsake in the container with prepaid postage and mail it
   back to Astrobotic, where your item will be placed in its Moon Capsule
   and integrated into the Moon Pod on the lunar lander.

   As your item is placed into the Moon Capsule for flight, we'll take a
   high-resolution photo of its integration on its way to the lunar
   surface and send it you.
