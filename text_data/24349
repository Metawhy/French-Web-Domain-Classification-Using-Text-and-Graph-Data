   5.0 out of 5 starsBest under eye cream!
   March 5, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Amazing product! What a difference 12 days made. I'm an absolute fan I
   will reorder again! It got to a point that under my eyes makeup no
   longer looked good. Now after 12 days and using the eye cream twice a
   day the results are fantastic! Both pictures are with makeup, but now
   my makeup glides smooth. I use Aragon oil underneath and wait 5 minutes
   before concealer.

     ✅PACKS OF 7 SILICONE SPONGE - purple, red, green, light blue, pink,
   yellow and orange

     ✅HIGH QUALITY FDA APPROVED - Silicone sponge with thick and soft
   bristle. No need to worry about leaving scratches to tableware anymore.
   It is easy to reach the corner of the cups and glasses. It’s simply the
   best sponge to clean dishes, pans, glasses, fruits and vegetables.
   NOTE: DESIGNED FOR LIGHT WASH

     ✅EASY TO CLEAN, EASY TO WASH - Antibacterial Dish Washing Sponges can
   be easily rinsed with water and wash machine. Or put them in the dish
   washer and hang them with the hook to dry them out. And yes! They are
   dish washer safe! And yes! They can be boiled due to high heat
   resistance!

     ✅MADE OF FOOD-GRADE, BPA FREE, ANTIBACTERIAL SILICONE - They do not
   absorb water nor are they porous which discourages any bacterial growth
   or unpleasant odor. They are antibacterial and totally free from
   chemical material. It’s time to say goodbye to traditional dish
   scrubber and replace them with silicone sponge. Bye-bye old dish
   scrubber

     ✅MULTIPLE FUNCTION – they are often used as hot pot holder, silicone
   coaster since they are heat resistant silicone (-60℃ to 230℃ / -76℉ to
   500℉). Not only that, they can also be used in the shower! Yup, even
   better.

How to use

   They do not absorb the soap nor water. So put some soap into a
   container and fill it out with hot water. And then wash the dishes from
   there with the silicone dishwashing scrubber

   Since they don’t have much scrubbing power (100% made of silicone),
   They are good for light wash. Ideally do the dishwashing soon after the
   usage or soak the dishes for a bit and then wash

   5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent bacteria free way to scrub
   February 5, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Excellent and just as described. These will not absorb any water and
   therefore they don’t act like a sponge. These you can use safely scrub
   grime off counters, dishes, tables but again no crumbs will stick to
   them and water won’t absorb. By far, the best part about this product
   is that you are not having a breeding ground in your kitchen for
   bacteria using a sponge. Once you use these you will not go back.!

   March 27, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I absolutely love these to use instead of a sponge I hate the way a
   sponge looks like 2 days after you use it also they smell. So I was
   always sticking it in the microwave or tossing them. Gets pricey. Well
   these are awesome. They come in different colors so I can use them for
   different places bathroom, also used on laundry stains after I pretreat
   try it works great. If I was going to change one thing maybe one with a
   little stiffer for when your kids or husband cooks and burns a bit.

   4.0 out of 5 starsYou decide - trade off clean/sanitary for sponge
   capability
   July 3, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I really wanted to love these, and I’m halfway there. I at least
   recommend that you try them, but I couldn’t give them 5 stars.
   The do solve the primary problem with regular sponges: they do not get
   mildewy and you can put them in the dishwasher and they get completely
   100% clean and dry. Love it for that.
   However, they fall short of traditional sponges in a couple areas. They
   don’t suds very well, so I ended up using way more soap than I usually
   do. And they don’t scrape. Despite being “pointy”, silicone is a smooth
   surface at the microscopic level, and the silicone is flexible. So they
   have literally no scraping capability whatsoever. Even less than a
   “regular” sponge. These can serve as an accompaniment to some other
   scraper or Scotch pad, but as the sole dish-cleaning instrument, they
   will fall short.

   5.0 out of 5 starsMissing a Great Marketing Opportunity
   July 13, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I fabricated my own kitchen counter tops from solid oak boards and put
   polyurethane on the surfaces. My guests and are very cautious not to
   abuse the counter tops. My roommate brought one of these kitchen
   sponges home that she bought from a local retailer. We've never used
   them as kitchen sponges but rather coasters. I liked hers so much I
   bought this set of sponges.
   There are 4-6 cups/tumblers/cans on the countertops at any given time.
   These sponges work great as coasters and add a little color to the
   kitchen. However, if you have a glass that sweats these aren't the best
   coaster since they will not absorb water and will have to be drained
   occasionally which can be messy.

   4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Alternative Sponge
   August 18, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Pros: Clean it in the dishwasher, reaches hard to reach spots because
   it’s flexible, can get sticky food like eggs and cheese off without
   getting food globs stuck which ruin a normal sponge.
   Cons: A little slippery, doesn’t hold soap well, can’t be used to
   absorb anything, sometimes ineffective for getting tougher / dried food
   off dishes
   Overall - I really love tris sponge as an additional tool in my
   kitchen. Rarely will I use it on all my dishes but it has made me use a
   traditional sponge less often. The reason I really love this sponge
   though is because my son has multiple allergies and I can use this as a
   dedicated sponge for his dishes or I can use it when I have to tackle
   something that has a high allergen for him and limit the likelihood of
   contaminating things like his drink cup or water bottle. The only
   disappointment is I’ve heard people say they use them to wipe
   countertops or tables but I can’t see how that would work since they
   don’t absorb liquid and would leave puddles around your counters.

   4.0 out of 5 starsThey are easy to wash out, nothing sticks to them!
   May 10, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Theses are handy, sturdy and efficient cleaning scrubs for dishes, pots
   & pans and even utensils. What I really dig about them is that nothing
   sticks to them after use, just add a drop or two of soap & wash out w/
   running water and they're ready for next use. The only issue I had was
   where to store it till next time, so I just let it drain on my dish
   rack tray and it's handy to reach when I need it. I'd recommend this
   product. In fact, the package came with quite a few so am tucking some
   away for stocking stuffers.

   I like the idea that they're cleanable. Sponges aren't very cleanable.
   So I toss them often. The alternative silicone has appeal in that
   department. But, these new, soft sponges don't get things clean as
   well. I'll keep trying. But, I find myself reaching for my regular
   sponge with its scrubbing side.

   These are good for scraping dishes before the dishwasher. I love that
   you can run them through the dishwasher to clean them. Easy to handle,
   as they are a small size that fits well in the hand. They are gentler
   than other cleaning tools on the pans. I am very happy with this
   purchase.

   5.0 out of 5 starsBest under eye cream!
   March 5, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Amazing product! What a difference 12 days made. I'm an absolute fan I
   will reorder again! It got to a point that under my eyes makeup no
   longer looked good. Now after 12 days and using the eye cream twice a
   day the results are fantastic! Both pictures are with makeup, but now
   my makeup glides smooth. I use Aragon oil underneath and wait 5 minutes
   before concealer.

How to use

   They do not absorb the soap nor water. So put some soap into a
   container and fill it out with hot water. And then wash the dishes from
   there with the silicone dishwashing scrubber

   Since they don’t have much scrubbing power (100% made of silicone),
   They are good for light wash. Ideally do the dishwashing soon after the
   usage or soak the dishes for a bit and then wash

   5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent bacteria free way to scrub
   February 5, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Excellent and just as described. These will not absorb any water and
   therefore they don’t act like a sponge. These you can use safely scrub
   grime off counters, dishes, tables but again no crumbs will stick to
   them and water won’t absorb. By far, the best part about this product
   is that you are not having a breeding ground in your kitchen for
   bacteria using a sponge. Once you use these you will not go back.!

   5.0 out of 5 starsLove these
   March 27, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I absolutely love these to use instead of a sponge I hate the way a
   sponge looks like 2 days after you use it also they smell. So I was
   always sticking it in the microwave or tossing them. Gets pricey. Well
   these are awesome. They come in different colors so I can use them for
   different places bathroom, also used on laundry stains after I pretreat
   try it works great. If I was going to change one thing maybe one with a
   little stiffer for when your kids or husband cooks and burns a bit.

   4.0 out of 5 starsYou decide - trade off clean/sanitary for sponge
   capability
   July 3, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I really wanted to love these, and I’m halfway there. I at least
   recommend that you try them, but I couldn’t give them 5 stars.
   The do solve the primary problem with regular sponges: they do not get
   mildewy and you can put them in the dishwasher and they get completely
   100% clean and dry. Love it for that.
   However, they fall short of traditional sponges in a couple areas. They
   don’t suds very well, so I ended up using way more soap than I usually
   do. And they don’t scrape. Despite being “pointy”, silicone is a smooth
   surface at the microscopic level, and the silicone is flexible. So they
   have literally no scraping capability whatsoever. Even less than a
   “regular” sponge. These can serve as an accompaniment to some other
   scraper or Scotch pad, but as the sole dish-cleaning instrument, they
   will fall short.

   5.0 out of 5 starsMissing a Great Marketing Opportunity
   July 13, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I fabricated my own kitchen counter tops from solid oak boards and put
   polyurethane on the surfaces. My guests and are very cautious not to
   abuse the counter tops. My roommate brought one of these kitchen
   sponges home that she bought from a local retailer. We've never used
   them as kitchen sponges but rather coasters. I liked hers so much I
   bought this set of sponges.
   There are 4-6 cups/tumblers/cans on the countertops at any given time.
   These sponges work great as coasters and add a little color to the
   kitchen. However, if you have a glass that sweats these aren't the best
   coaster since they will not absorb water and will have to be drained
   occasionally which can be messy.

   4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Alternative Sponge
   August 18, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Pros: Clean it in the dishwasher, reaches hard to reach spots because
   it’s flexible, can get sticky food like eggs and cheese off without
   getting food globs stuck which ruin a normal sponge.
   Cons: A little slippery, doesn’t hold soap well, can’t be used to
   absorb anything, sometimes ineffective for getting tougher / dried food
   off dishes
   Overall - I really love tris sponge as an additional tool in my
   kitchen. Rarely will I use it on all my dishes but it has made me use a
   traditional sponge less often. The reason I really love this sponge
   though is because my son has multiple allergies and I can use this as a
   dedicated sponge for his dishes or I can use it when I have to tackle
   something that has a high allergen for him and limit the likelihood of
   contaminating things like his drink cup or water bottle. The only
   disappointment is I’ve heard people say they use them to wipe
   countertops or tables but I can’t see how that would work since they
   don’t absorb liquid and would leave puddles around your counters.

   4.0 out of 5 starsThey are easy to wash out, nothing sticks to them!

   Theses are handy, sturdy and efficient cleaning scrubs for dishes, pots
   & pans and even utensils. What I really dig about them is that nothing
   sticks to them after use, just add a drop or two of soap & wash out w/
   running water and they're ready for next use. The only issue I had was
   where to store it till next time, so I just let it drain on my dish
   rack tray and it's handy to reach when I need it. I'd recommend this
   product. In fact, the package came with quite a few so am tucking some
   away for stocking stuffers.

   Verified Purchase
   I like the idea that they're cleanable. Sponges aren't very cleanable.
   So I toss them often. The alternative silicone has appeal in that
   department. But, these new, soft sponges don't get things clean as
   well. I'll keep trying. But, I find myself reaching for my regular
   sponge with its scrubbing side.

   These are good for scraping dishes before the dishwasher. I love that
   you can run them through the dishwasher to clean them. Easy to handle,
   as they are a small size that fits well in the hand. They are gentler
   than other cleaning tools on the pans. I am very happy with this
   purchase.

   1.0 out of 5 starsA knock off product?
   February 7, 2018
   Verified Purchase
   So I used it a couple of days with no effect then I found another
   product which has identical ingredients to this one. Either this is a
   knockoff of the Eye Gel by Radha Beauty or other way around I don't
   know.
   https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H7TV2GW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_
   s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
   Check out the attached pictures for the comparison of ingredients.
   Here couple of other products with almost identical ingredients.

   1.0 out of 5 starsDo Not Buy! Terrible Product. My eyes are much worse
   after use.
   October 19, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   This product made my under eyes red and irritated. I really wanted to
   love this product. I really ended up hating it. It is only now after
   purchasing and using this product that I took the time to read the
   negative reviews and WOW i should have read them first. This is indeed
   some kind if scam. My results are the same as many many others! My eyes
   are much worse than they were before use. I am extremely unhappy with
   this product.

   1.0 out of 5 starsWorst product I've ever put on my face ....zero stars
   August 18, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   This product did not fair well on my skin in the least bit. My dark
   circles worstened and seemed to be scarring from the red, welp like
   marks I would get when applying it. I tried it for 2 weeks just to make
   sure it wasn't just a phase and as you can see from the photos, there's
   a huge difference in the before and after... I just wanted to tighten
   and lighten.... total opposite.

   5.0 out of 5 starsIt really does work...
   July 1, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Give it time and use it religiously- this thing really works!! As a
   mother of 4 in her 30's, I also nanny full time for 3 additional little
   ones. I'm always running on minimal to no sleep, don't eat right, am
   always on the go... This helped actually take away the dark circles I
   was spending so much money on expensive makeup to conceal! Try to
   anyway... they always would shine through until now!! Two weeks between
   photos.
   ***This is my own opinion and I haven't received anything free, nor
   have I been paid for this review.

   5.0 out of 5 starsI was plagued with dark circled and crow's feet and
   gave this a 1 week test!
   February 17, 2018
   Verified Purchase
    I did a 1 week test of this product for 2 problems I have: dark
   circles and crow's feet (I'm 48). I'll post pics but be aware that the
   before pics were taken on an overcast day and the after ones on a sunny
   day - but what you CAN compare is the contrast between the dark circles
   under my eyes and the rest of my skin on the same day - in the after
   pics, you can see my skin all looks one color (for the most part),
   whereas in the before pics, the dark circles stand out from the rest of
   the surrounding skin.
   I did a video but I'll also upload the pics. I took pics of me smiling,
   not smiling, and a side view close up so I could see how the crow's
   feet were doing. As far as dark circles, I literally look like someone
   beat me they're so bad in the before pics. But the after pics, it's SO
   much lighter!
   Really, really happy with the results. I use it mornings before I put
   on makeup and at night after I take my makeup off. I also use it on my
   laugh lines on my cheeks and on my neck where the wrinkling has begun!
   It's helping there, too. I like that it's not greasy. It goes on almost
   like a light mask and tightens ever so slightly as it dries completely.
   Not in an uncomfortable way, though.

   1.0 out of 5 starsDid not reduce the bags under my eyes!
   December 27, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   This gel is pleasant to the touch and does a nice job of moisture gel.
   However, I purchased it because I have bags under my eyes and wanted to
   get rid of them. I am half way through the jar and see no difference. I
   do not have dark circles, so I cannot comment on that aspect of this
   product. It is as good as, but no better than, Neutrogena Hydrogel,
   which is significantly less expensive. Thus, I cannot recommend this
   product.
   If results improve with the second half of the jar, I will amend this
   review.

   2.0 out of 5 starsSo sad -- didn't work for me.
   June 10, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Well I've been using this twice a day for about two and a half months
   (Mar 30 to Jun 10) and am sad to report that the results have not been
   significant in my case. On the plus side it is easy to apply and some
   of the wrinkles have been reduced. But I wonder if the slight wrinkle
   reduction is a result of the twice daily massage or did it come from
   the cream? Actually I was hoping for some reduction in the puffiness
   under my eyes and for this there hasn't been any progress. Or I am too
   far over the hill to get any noticeable results.

   3.0 out of 5 starsPros and Cons
   February 23, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Since it arrived, I've been using this product twice a day for a full
   month. I really love the product dispenser. It's easy to use, always
   dispenses just enough, and helps prevent contamination. Once applied,
   the eye gel feels great. It feels similar to an aloe gel, but with more
   of a cucumber aroma. There is a slightly cool, slightly tingling
   feeling/sensation. If you apply to much, it will feel heavy and kind of
   sticky. I try my best to apply a relatively thin and even layer of
   product around my under eye and also over my eyelids. It is certainly
   not the miracle eye gel that I was expecting after having read other
   reviews. The first photo was taken the day it arrived, Jan 22, 2017 &
   the second photo is from today, Feb 23, 2017 (no makeup worn in either
   photograph). Personally, I don't see a difference between the before
   and after. I wasn't expecting over night results, but some of the other
   photo reviews for this product (with 10 days between images) made me
   feel like I should see some kind of difference. I was not paid to make
   this review, I didn't receive any discount on the product - I am just
   an almost 30 yr old female trying to get rid of hereditary dark circles
   and some fine wrinkles. While I will continue to use this product until
   it is all gone, but it looks like I am still on the search for a
   product that produces results... I will update this review once I have
   finished using the rest of the product.
   2/24/17 - Quick update, the Baebody Team reached out to me and refunded
   my order, without me even having to ask. That is very kind, and makes
   me feel good to know that Baebody genuinely stands behind the integrity
   their products. As far as customer service, certainly deserves 5 stars.

   5.0 out of 5 starsCute and simple
   March 4, 2019
   Color: Light BlueVerified Purchase
   I had been eyeing these for a while since I needed to stop just setting
   my toothbrush precariously over the edge of my sink. I ended up moving
   and my new bathroom has a small vanity and not a lot of space so I
   purchased these. I like them because they're small and cute and don't
   take up as much space as a regular toothbrush holder would. They keep
   our brushes upright which is more sanitary. I would definitely
   recommend if you need a simple toothbrush holder.

   I just love these!! How did I not think of this haha I put one in my
   bathroom and boyfriends bathroom. I like knowing my toothbrush isn’t
   touching anything but air and can dry easily. Traveling is a breeze.

   5.0 out of 5 starsGreat idea, works great, and great price
   July 1, 2019
   Color: WhiteVerified Purchase
   I got this to not have to lay my toothbrush flat (cleaner, and saves
   space). They work very well and look good, too. The ceramic material
   gives them plenty of weight so the toothbrushes sit very sturdy, and
   they're big enough to fit probably any size manual toothbrush (and
   apparently some small electrics, judging by some of the other review
   pics). The fact that you get two makes it a much easier decision (had
   the price been for only a single stand, I might have felt it was
   overpriced for something so simple).
   All in all, I'm very happy I purchased this set. They fulfilled my
   needs perfectly!

   July 16, 2019
   Color: WhiteVerified Purchase
   I used this in a small bathroom that has a small sink with not much
   room for a tooth brush cup. This toothbrush stand saved a lot of room
   and allowed me to keep my toothbrush on the sink. It is a ceramic type
   product so I do not have any health concerns with it.

   5.0 out of 5 starsStylish tooth brush holders are not easy to find
   October 6, 2018
   Color: WhiteVerified Purchase
   How freaking cute are these? Stylish tooth brush holders are not easy
   to find. I was searching for something that would look acceptable on
   the counter and easy to clean, as they normally get so gross over time.
   This product is stylish, sturdy, quality made and functions very well.
   There’s also a hole in the bottom for the water to drain so you don’t
   get that gross mess. You definitely won’t find this unique piece in
   most homes. I’m very happy with this purchase!

   April 13, 2018
   Color: WhiteVerified Purchase
   BRILLIANT! Minimalist and functional. This product makes so much sense.
   So much less gross than most toothbrush holders. I thought these would
   be small cups to hold the brushes, but they are actually rings with
   holes all the way through, which is even better because water cannot
   accumulate inside the holder.

   Color: WhiteVerified Purchase
   These were a nice surprise. Was looking for a toothbrush holder that
   didn’t take up a big footprint, had a simple design, and was easy to
   clean. This fits the bill! We have one at each of the jack and jill
   sinks. Wish they were a little less expressive because I’d like to get
   them for the other members of the family. :)

   4.0 out of 5 starsTired nursing moms - READ ME!
   June 22, 2018
   Verified Purchase
   So you’re up all night feeding a newborn and you keep seeing ads on FB
   for this ‘Land’ diaper bag. It’s available on multiple websites but the
   cost isn’t consistent. You’re asking yourself if this particular bag is
   legit? The reviews are pretty decent, but some moms aren’t very pleased
   with their purchase...you’re not sure if you should buy this one for
   $35, or splurge and go for the more expensive one. Let me help you with
   that decision and save you some time so that you can go on a ‘late
   night feeding amazon binge’ for other baby stuff that tired brain is
   convinced that you need!
   First off, this diaper bag is adorable! It looks exactly like it does
   in the photos, so don’t worry about that! I thought it was going to be
   a little bit on the bulky side, but it’s actually not at all. I also
   have the JuJubee backpack and find that one to be a little ‘clunky’. A
   lot of the reviews that I read for this bag claim that the material is
   cheaply made. While it’s not the same quality as my JJB bag, (but why
   would it be when this bag is $35 and the JJB is $120), I wouldn’t say
   that it’s necessarily “cheap”. It’s $35 and you’re getting exactly what
   you paid for. The functionally of the bag is awesome! It’s deep, has
   plenty of pockets and the bottle compartment does keep milk warm for
   awhile. I’ve only been using this bag for a few days so I can’t speak
   to it’s long term durability. What I do know, is that if and when this
   thing falls apart, I’m not going to waste time being upset about it, it
   was only $35!!!! If you’re debating your purchase, I say go for it. Why
   spend $90 when this bag, albeit a knock-off, works just fine. Happy
   binge shopping mama’s!

   4.0 out of 5 starsHaloVA vs Sunveno
   May 15, 2018
   Verified Purchase
   Purchased this backpack (HaloVa Diaper Bag) in black and the SUNVENO in
   navy (SUNVENO Baby Diaper Bag Backpack Large Travel Waterproof Nappy
   Changing Bag Insulated Backbag (Navy)) to compare for an international
   trip with my 4 and 1 year old.
   HaloVa
   - On its own, it looked nice and well done
   - The black didn't look washed out.
   - It was very nicely packaged for shipping.
   - As a negative, it didn't include the cellphone pocket in the back as
   shown in the pictures.
   - I didn't actually measure it to verify the dimensions (picture says
   18.5" and description says 16.5") but this bag is 2-3" shorter than the
   Sunveno.
   - My kids zippy cups, we use NUK, fit in the bottle pockets, but the
   Dr. Brown 8oz bottles were too tall (4oz would fit ok).
   - This bag doesn't have the D rings for the for the stroller hooks and
   it's not supposed to as it's not pictured, but have seen people ask.
   - I can't speak for durability as ended up keeping the Sunveno.
   Compared to Sunveno:
   - the Sunveno looked better quality. Material is softer
   - It's taller as mentioned above.
   - Sunveno does include the D rings for stroller and the back pocket for
   cellphone.
   - Sunveno doesn't fit Dr. Browns 8oz bottles either.
   Overall I wouldn't say not to buy this backpack (based on 1st
   impressions). Personally for a $14 difference and taller size I decided
   to keep the Sunveno. Return was easy and painless and free.

   5.0 out of 5 starsPretty Coral-ish backpack
   June 4, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Pretty Coral-ish backpack!
   A basic run down..
   PROS-
   Nice Snaplock strap structure✔
   Easy Access tissue pocket ✔
   Keeps Shape ✔
   Bright color ✔
   Nice interior lining, easy to clean ✔
   Easy access back pocket ✔
   Lots of wide pockets ✔
   Front pocket has a insulated lining that's great for drinks ✔
   Huge but doesn't look so when worn ✔
   CONS-
   Straps could of been made a bit longer
   ------
   The backpack is fashionable, and convenient to mothers whom are in need
   of a diaper bag. The bag opening has a nice gold zipper, that adds a
   nice expensive look to it.
   The bag has TWO side pockets for bottles, which I tested my standard
   hydroflask in, and other various bottles. It has a nice elastic which
   ensures that the bottles are snug and don't end up falling, or slipping
   out.
   The main OUTER POCKET has 3 insulated pockets that can be used to keep
   drinks warm or cold.
   The MAIN COMPARTMENT is SPACIOUS. HUGE. HUMONGO. I included a picture
   to show that even if I put large thick books in here, there was plenty
   of space left. There are several pockets inside wide enough for
   diapers, formulas, baby wipes, and other miscellaneous items. The thing
   I really like about this, is that the inside looks easy to clean. The
   material sort of resembles the inner lining of a lunch bag, it's soft,
   and doesn't seem like it will rip, or get destroyed. It's cleanable,
   and easy to wipe off.
   OVERALL:
   I could see this bag being GREAT for mothers, or even as car ride/long
   trip backpack. I plan to use this as the later. The bag is very
   versatile. I can use it to put snacks, chips, and other drinks in. It
   holds a large amount and does not appear bulky. It holds and maintains
   its shape, without looking slouchy-- presenting a really nice and
   expensive look to it. The straps could be a bit longer, but because I
   am 5'2, it fits fine. The color orange looks more like a coral shade.
   It's actually a really nice spring color that stands out. This
   definitely doesn't look like a regular backpack. It stands out, while
   being completely convenient. I'm actually considering this in purple.

   1.0 out of 5 starsGreat in every way except very poor
   craftsmanship/quality
   July 3, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   After trying out several different brands of diaper backpacks, I
   finally settled on this one because of the large capacity, lightweight,
   practical storage units and nice look of this bag. Unfortunately, not
   much can be said for the quality, during my FIRST outing with the bag
   (short outing for errands), I noticed the stitching was already coming
   undone. I'm so disappointed.
