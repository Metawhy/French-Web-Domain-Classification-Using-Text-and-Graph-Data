The CentOS Project

   The CentOS Project is a community-driven free software effort focused
   on delivering a robust open source ecosystem around a Linux platform.

   We offer two Linux distros:

   – CentOS Linux is a consistent, manageable platform that suits a wide
   variety of deployments. For some open source communities, it is a
   solid, predictable base to build upon.

   – The new CentOS Stream is a rolling-release distro that tracks just
   ahead of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) development, positioned as a
   midstream between Fedora Linux and RHEL. For anyone interested in
   participating and collaborating in the RHEL ecosystem, CentOS Stream is
   your reliable platform for innovation.

   In support of this community effort, the CentOS Project provides
   extensive resources to build, test, release, and maintain code on these
   platforms.

   For more information about updates and improvements in CentOS Stream
   and CentOS Linux 8, please check out the CentOS Stream release notes
   and the CentOS linux release notes or the release announcement in the
   mailing list archive. Information about other actively maintained
   CentOS Linux releases is available on the CentOS Linux 7 and CentOS
   Linux 6 release notes pages.
