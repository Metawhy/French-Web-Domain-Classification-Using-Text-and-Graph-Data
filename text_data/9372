English Video Discussion - Crazy Guy gets Stung by Scorpion

   [scorpion-651142_1920.jpg]
   This discussion uses a lot of conditionals like "what would you do?"
   Key Vocab:
   Epipen- Medicine to stop your heart from racing after an animal sting
   Lethal - Can kill you
   Venom - a deadly liquid in animals that they attack with
   Swelling - After an injury, the blood rushes to the area of the body
   and makes it get bigger.
   Pre- Discussion:
   Do you have scorpions where you live?
   Have you ever been stung by a bee, wasp, or other insect?
   Would you ever do something crazy to get more attention for your
   Youtube videos?

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFw_HRG8PvY

   Post-Discussion:
   What kind of reaction did Coyote have to the scorpion sting?
   Would you have done what he did? Why or why not?
   Would you have done what he did for money? How much?

Five Ways to Start a Presentation Effectively

   Here is a narrated video I created to teach you how to effectively
   start your presentations! Sometimes it is hard to know how we should
   start a presentation, this video and slide show gives five ways to make
   that happen.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ass05pqvOic

   In this video, I go through examples of each type of starter, then I
   make sure that I give an example of how to use them. I hope this will
   be of great help to you in starting your presentations.
   For teachers, if you would like to use this lecture for your classes,
   here is the downloadable worksheet for the lecture.

English Video Discussion - The Afterlife

   [AURORA-Short-Film-2.jpg]
   This is a beautiful video showing how far a parent would go to be with
   his or her child. It is sad, but it is also hopeful and touching.
   Pre-Discussion:
    1. What are some beliefs that people have about the afterlife (after
       you die)?
    2. How would you feel if you could see someone you had lost to death
       again?

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/IdrDX0pGPsM

   Post -Discussion:
    1. What did the father do?
    2. Why did he do it?
    3. Would you have done the same thing? Why or Why not?

Five Free Ways to Improve your English Now!

   Many times, we want to do something important, like lose weight,
   exercise, or learn a skill, but we put it off for another day. One day
   becomes two, then three, and a year later, we haven't even started.
   That's the reason why I wrote this post. I want you to start improving
   your English today! This post is focused on giving you steps that you
   can take right now to help you achieve your English goals and your
   career goals.
   [alarm-clock-clock-macro-100733.jpg]
   1.  Entertainment: What kind of movies/TV shows do you like?  Crackle
   is a service by Sony that has all free full length, high-quality, legal
   movies to watch. They have an app on Android and Apple as well.  I
   would recommend Crackle if you don't have access to Hulu or Netflix, or
   can't spend the money on those services right now. Choose one
   show/movie and commit yourself to starting to watch the entire movie or
   season/all episodes, starting today. This will greatly expand your
   vocabulary and knowledge of idioms as well.   Use the subtitles to
   increase your reading and listening abilities. When you feel that you
   are confident enough, drop the subtitles.
   [Crackle%2B%2B%2BWatch%2BFree%2BMovies%2BOnline%2B%25E2%2580%2593%2BFul
   l%2BLength%2BStreaming%2BMovies.png]
   If possible, sign up for a pay service like Netflix, Hulu, or some
   other movie/TV show streaming service. They have newer content, better
   phone apps,  and more features to their sites. Use the subtitles to
   increase your reading and listening abilities.
    If you are interested in how to watch media sources like these to
   improve certain areas of your English, please check out this post on
   How to Watch Movies to Learn English. Other sites like "Daily Motion,"
   "Vimeo, " "PBS Video" or "Short Film of the Week" are great to watch
   movies and films in your interest area.
   [chess-2727443_1280.jpg]
   2. Gamify your English:  How many people have you heard say, "I just
   love learning English. It is so fun!"? I bet  you haven't heard too
   many people say that. I sure haven't, but it doesn't have to be that
   way.
   Some students may think that language learning has to be boring. It
   doesn't! Great sites are available to learn English in a fun way. Try
   apps like Memrise, Duolingo, and Babbel to help you to be motivated.
   Each one of these has its benefits. I find that Duolingo is more for
   phrases and general language knowledge, but Memrise is more about
   learning the rules of the language. Babbel has both a paid and free
   service. Another great free site is Games to Learn English.
   My favorite site to show my students  and to use with them is Quizlet,
   which is a free service (for students) that has thousands of flashcard
   sets that students can use to study their English.
   So, start with a site like Duolingo,  Quizlet or Memrise today, and see
   how it motivates you to study harder.
   3. News:  If you commonly check the news, change the way you get your
   news. Place an English site as your homepage in your browser today. If
   you usually get news from a site in your country, change the language
   in your browser settings. Also, try out some really great resources
   like Readlang, a chrome app that allows you to click on any word for a
   definition and create flashcards from each word clicked. See a sample
   below from English to Spanish.
   [whitehouse.png]
   Sites like www.lingro.com also have features that allow you to be able
   to click on text and change the language. Another great upcoming site
   is en.news, a site that creates quizzes and practice from CNN news
   stories every day.
   [castbox.jpg]
   4. Podcasts:  Use  services like iTunes or Castbox for Android to
   download podcasts on your
   preferred topics in English.  The great thing about Castbox is that you
   can download your podcasts with a Wifi Signal, then listen to them
   later while you are on the go. Also, you can slow the speed down if the
   speaker is too fast. Listen while you drive to work, walk through town,
   or when you are in a boring class (just kidding!).
   The most important thing in choosing a podcast is to find a subject you
   enjoy or can be useful to you.  Also, if there is a story you know in
   your language, find the English version on an audio book service like
   Audible and listen to the story in English. Your familiarity with the
   story will allow you to pick out a lot of new vocabulary and phrases in
   English.
   One very interesting Podcast I enjoy is called "Hardcore History" by
   Dan Carlin. Another popular one is called the "Walk," which is a story
   in which the listening is the main character and "walks" through
   Scotland on an adventure (I don't know if I can fully recommend it as I
   just heard about it). Let me know if it is any good.
   [blur-call-cell-346734.jpg] 5. Conversation Apps:  It is one thing to
   learn rules and grammar in a language, but it is an entirely different
   thing to be able to have a conversation. However, that is the main
   point of why many people want to learn a language. There are a few free
   apps like Tandem and HelloTalk that allow speakers to pair up with
   native speakers from all over the world. Many times these speakers want
   to learn your language as you practice theirs, so it is a good
   exchange. Both Tandem and HelloTalk are available through the App
   stores in Google Play and the Apple Store. Download one of them today!
   We have a saying in English: "The journey of a thousand miles begins
   with a single step." This means that in order to achieve a big dream,
   you have to take an action in that direction. So, I encourage you to
   watch a movie in English on Crackle, download one of these apps, find a
   great podcast, but do something!
   Please let me know below any other ideas of how you improve your
   English below in the comments section.

English Video Discussion - Breakups

   Many of us have experienced the hurt of a relationship breakup, but how
   long does it take to find the right person again? This video shows how
   easily a person can think they have found the right person, but then
   realize that they might not have been the right one after all.
   [break%2Bup.jpeg]
   Pre-Discussion:
    1. Do you believe that dating before marriage is a good idea or bad
       idea? Why?
    2. Have you ever had to break up with someone? Has anyone ever broken
       up with you?
    3. Have you ever thought you loved someone only to find out that he or
       she wasn't for you?
    4. What qualities do you think are in the ideal (perfect) partner?

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/JFDAvcwDPTA?rel=0

   Post-Discussion:
    1. What did the man think would happen if he met the woman?
    2. What happened after he finally met the woman on the bus?
    3. What happened when he found out the woman on the bus wouldn't be
       with him?
    4. Do you agree with the idea of a man/woman of your dreams?
    5. What was the video trying to show about finding the perfect
       partner?

   What do you think of the video?  Please comment below to join in the
   discussion!

Five Ways to Start a Presentation Effectively

   Here is a narrated video I created to teach you how to effectively
   start your presentations! Sometimes it is hard to know how we should
   start a presentation, this video and slide show gives five ways to make
   that happen.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ass05pqvOic

   In this video, I go through examples of each type of starter, then I
   make sure that I give an example of how to use them. I hope this will
   be of great help to you in starting your presentations.
   For teachers, if you would like to use this lecture for your classes,
   here is the downloadable worksheet for the lecture.

       There is lots of help available online to help with a presentation
       but being nervous is always going to be a part of it.

English Video Discussion - The Afterlife

   [AURORA-Short-Film-2.jpg]
   This is a beautiful video showing how far a parent would go to be with
   his or her child. It is sad, but it is also hopeful and touching.
   Pre-Discussion:
    1. What are some beliefs that people have about the afterlife (after
       you die)?
    2. How would you feel if you could see someone you had lost to death
       again?

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/IdrDX0pGPsM

   Post -Discussion:
    1. What did the father do?
    2. Why did he do it?
    3. Would you have done the same thing? Why or Why not?

Five Free Ways to Improve your English Now!

   Many times, we want to do something important, like lose weight,
   exercise, or learn a skill, but we put it off for another day. One day
   becomes two, then three, and a year later, we haven't even started.
   That's the reason why I wrote this post. I want you to start improving
   your English today! This post is focused on giving you steps that you
   can take right now to help you achieve your English goals and your
   career goals.
   [alarm-clock-clock-macro-100733.jpg]
   1.  Entertainment: What kind of movies/TV shows do you like?  Crackle
   is a service by Sony that has all free full length, high-quality, legal
   movies to watch. They have an app on Android and Apple as well.  I
   would recommend Crackle if you don't have access to Hulu or Netflix, or
   can't spend the money on those services right now. Choose one
   show/movie and commit yourself to starting to watch the entire movie or
   season/all episodes, starting today. This will greatly expand your
   vocabulary and knowledge of idioms as well.   Use the subtitles to
   increase your reading and listening abilities. When you feel that you
   are confident enough, drop the subtitles.
   [Crackle%2B%2B%2BWatch%2BFree%2BMovies%2BOnline%2B%25E2%2580%2593%2BFul
   l%2BLength%2BStreaming%2BMovies.png]
   If possible, sign up for a pay service like Netflix, Hulu, or some
   other movie/TV show streaming service. They have newer content, better
   phone apps,  and more features to their sites. Use the subtitles to
   increase your reading and listening abilities.
    If you are interested in how to watch media sources like these to
   improve certain areas of your English, please check out this post on
   How to Watch Movies to Learn English. Other sites like "Daily Motion,"
   "Vimeo, " "PBS Video" or "Short Film of the Week" are great to watch
   movies and films in your interest area.
   [chess-2727443_1280.jpg]
   2. Gamify your English:  How many people have you heard say, "I just
   love learning English. It is so fun!"? I bet  you haven't heard too
   many people say that. I sure haven't, but it doesn't have to be that
   way.
   Some students may think that language learning has to be boring. It
   doesn't! Great sites are available to learn English in a fun way. Try
   apps like Memrise, Duolingo, and Babbel to help you to be motivated.
   Each one of these has its benefits. I find that Duolingo is more for
   phrases and general language knowledge, but Memrise is more about
   learning the rules of the language. Babbel has both a paid and free
   service. Another great free site is Games to Learn English.
   My favorite site to show my students  and to use with them is Quizlet,
   which is a free service (for students) that has thousands of flashcard
   sets that students can use to study their English.
   So, start with a site like Duolingo,  Quizlet or Memrise today, and see
   how it motivates you to study harder.
   3. News:  If you commonly check the news, change the way you get your
   news. Place an English site as your homepage in your browser today. If
   you usually get news from a site in your country, change the language
   in your browser settings. Also, try out some really great resources
   like Readlang, a chrome app that allows you to click on any word for a
   definition and create flashcards from each word clicked. See a sample
   below from English to Spanish.
   [whitehouse.png]
   Sites like www.lingro.com also have features that allow you to be able
   to click on text and change the language. Another great upcoming site
   is en.news, a site that creates quizzes and practice from CNN news
   stories every day.
   [castbox.jpg]
   4. Podcasts:  Use  services like iTunes or Castbox for Android to
   download podcasts on your
   preferred topics in English.  The great thing about Castbox is that you
   can download your podcasts with a Wifi Signal, then listen to them
   later while you are on the go. Also, you can slow the speed down if the
   speaker is too fast. Listen while you drive to work, walk through town,
   or when you are in a boring class (just kidding!).
   The most important thing in choosing a podcast is to find a subject you
   enjoy or can be useful to you.  Also, if there is a story you know in
   your language, find the English version on an audio book service like
   Audible and listen to the story in English. Your familiarity with the
   story will allow you to pick out a lot of new vocabulary and phrases in
   English.
   One very interesting Podcast I enjoy is called "Hardcore History" by
   Dan Carlin. Another popular one is called the "Walk," which is a story
   in which the listening is the main character and "walks" through
   Scotland on an adventure (I don't know if I can fully recommend it as I
   just heard about it). Let me know if it is any good.
   [blur-call-cell-346734.jpg] 5. Conversation Apps:  It is one thing to
   learn rules and grammar in a language, but it is an entirely different
   thing to be able to have a conversation. However, that is the main
   point of why many people want to learn a language. There are a few free
   apps like Tandem and HelloTalk that allow speakers to pair up with
   native speakers from all over the world. Many times these speakers want
   to learn your language as you practice theirs, so it is a good
   exchange. Both Tandem and HelloTalk are available through the App
   stores in Google Play and the Apple Store. Download one of them today!
   We have a saying in English: "The journey of a thousand miles begins
   with a single step." This means that in order to achieve a big dream,
   you have to take an action in that direction. So, I encourage you to
   watch a movie in English on Crackle, download one of these apps, find a
   great podcast, but do something!
   Please let me know below any other ideas of how you improve your
   English below in the comments section.

       Fantastic blog! Do you have any recommendations for aspiring
       writers?
       I’m planning to start my own website soon but I’m a little lost on
       everything.
       Would you propose starting with a free platform like
       Wordpress or go for a paid option? There are so many options out
       there that
       I’m completely overwhelmed .. Any tips? Kudos
       Regards: Eve Hunt

       There are video tapes to assist you in improving English. But they
       are not much help.
       compare airport parking
