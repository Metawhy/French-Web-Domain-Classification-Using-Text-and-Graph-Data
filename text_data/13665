50 shades of Beige for Spring

   22nd February 2019 No Comments
   50 shades of beige for spring

   As much as beige gets a lots of bad rap and is considered by many
   lifeless and unexciting, I love wearing it in all its varying shades
   and this season (luckily for me and maybe you too if you share my love
   for neutrals) there is no shortage of gorgeous beige/neutral pieces all
   over the high street since beige made into the most wanted trends for
   Spring 19 after all the SS19 fashion shows.

   The trend was championed by the major designers all over the runways
   not only by the usual suspects like Max Mara and Burberry but also by
   much bolder designers that normally steer away from such neutral
   shades.

   For me, and many others out there, beige is a classic and always chic.
   Beige is versatile and can be paired with most colours and it works
   well if you want to wear it head to toe too. In fact, head to toe is
   the word for SS19 but of course we always have to make trends our own
   and wear them whichever way they work best for us in our daily lives.

   This season beige is no longer boring in fact quite the opposite. If
   you still have your doubts just keep scrolling down and get inspired by
   some of my favourite beige looks.

How To Add A Personal Touch To Your Decor

   16th January 2019 No Comments

   Styling your home to meet your need is part of the joy of interior
   decor. Whatever you want to change, your options are unlimited. So
   let’s take a look at what redecorating your home means and some of the
   ideas that you might want to implement. Your home is your castle and
   making the most of the space and rooms that you have will come down to
   getting as much out of it as you put in.

Paint the walls

   One of the ways that most of us update our homes to get a fresh look is
   by painting the walls with a new colour every so often. But have you
   ever stopped to consider what the colours you are using mean to you? A

5 Steps To Building Your Perfect Wardrobe

   11th January 2019 No Comments

   What’s one of the best ways to refresh your style and your life ready
   for the arrival of spring? It would have to be revamping your closet,
   having an epic decluttering sessions and freshening up the space you
   store your clothes in. There is a lot to be said for the power of
   organisation to streamline your life, buying lesser and better quality,
   taking care of the things we love, and paring everything back to the
   essentials. Your perfect wardrobe is a matter of individual
   preferences, and matching your clothes to your aesthetic and lifestyle.
   Here’s how to get there in five easy steps…

Organise Your Space

   You may be lucky enough to have a space that you can use as a dressing
   room, or a walk in closet that you can organise exactly how you like.
   The area where you store your most treasured belongings is definitely
   worth some time and effort. Start with the basics like repainting,
   adding shelving or extra rails, buying sturdy shoe racks and the like.
   You want your room to be comfortable so don’t forget things like ac
   unit repair or proper blinds as well.

Declutter What You Have

   Most of us own far too many clothes which never get worn – either stuff
   we have bought in the sales that doesn’t suit or perhaps doesn’t fit,
   things we’ve outgrown or pieces which no longer fit our needs. Commit
   to paring down these items to key pieces and donating things which
   haven’t been worn in months. Then when you have a clearer idea of the
   clothes you really have to house, you can plan out storage solutions
   much better.

Define Your Signature Look

   Anyone who is truly stylish has taken the time to work out a signature
   look which works perfectly for the life they lead, their body shape,
   and how they want to present themselves to the world. Make a list of
   your daily situations, the events you go to, the colors you’re drawn to
   and what qualities you would like to see in your clothes (practical?
   feminine? high quality?). Your style needs to inspire you and allow you
   to express yourself, but also to be appropriate for the life you lead –
   there’s little point in having hundreds of cocktail dresses if you very
   rarely go out at night!

Know What Works For You

   You also want to work out which shapes suit your body and come up with
   two or three combinations that work for you which you can then recreate
   in different colours and finishes. A session with a personal stylist
   can be really useful for this, or find a celebrity with a similar body
   type to yours and take a look at their best outfits for some quick
   inspiration.

Add Interest With Accessories

   Once you have the basics sorted you can add a little flair and
   individuality to your look simply by adding a few accessories. It could
   be a colorful silk scarf or perhaps some delicate layered necklaces.
   Maybe you’re a fan of a statement boot or some showstopping tasselled
   earrings? Work out what makes you happy and expresses your personality
   and go for it!


   Love, P

   rarely go out at night!

Know What Works For You

   You also want to work out which shapes suit your body and come up with
   two or three combinations that work for you which you can then recreate
   in different colours and finishes. A session with a personal stylist
   can be really useful for this, or find a celebrity with a similar body
   type to yours and take a look at their best outfits for some quick
   inspiration.

Add Interest With Accessories

   Once you have the basics sorted you can add a little flair and
   individuality to your look simply by adding a few accessories. It could
   be a colorful silk scarf or perhaps some delicate layered necklaces.
   Maybe you’re a fan of a statement boot or some showstopping tasselled
   earrings? Work out what makes you happy and expresses your personality
   and go for it!

50 shades of Beige for Spring

   22nd February 2019 No Comments
   50 shades of beige for spring

   As much as beige gets a lots of bad rap and is considered by many
   lifeless and unexciting, I love wearing it in all its varying shades
   and this season (luckily for me and maybe you too if you share my love
   for neutrals) there is no shortage of gorgeous beige/neutral pieces all
   over the high street since beige made into the most wanted trends for
   Spring 19 after all the SS19 fashion shows.

   The trend was championed by the major designers all over the runways
   not only by the usual suspects like Max Mara and Burberry but also by
   much bolder designers that normally steer away from such neutral
   shades.

   For me, and many others out there, beige is a classic and always chic.
   Beige is versatile and can be paired with most colours and it works
   well if you want to wear it head to toe too. In fact, head to toe is
   the word for SS19 but of course we always have to make trends our own
   and wear them whichever way they work best for us in our daily lives.

   This season beige is no longer boring in fact quite the opposite. If
   you still have your doubts just keep scrolling down and get inspired by
   some of my favourite beige looks.

How To Add A Personal Touch To Your Decor

   16th January 2019 No Comments

   Styling your home to meet your need is part of the joy of interior
   decor. Whatever you want to change, your options are unlimited. So
   let’s take a look at what redecorating your home means and some of the
   ideas that you might want to implement. Your home is your castle and
   making the most of the space and rooms that you have will come down to
   getting as much out of it as you put in.

Paint the walls

   One of the ways that most of us update our homes to get a fresh look is
   by painting the walls with a new colour every so often. But have you
   ever stopped to consider what the colours you are using mean to you? A
   growing trend in interior design is to acknowledge and understand

5 Steps To Building Your Perfect Wardrobe

   11th January 2019 No Comments

   What’s one of the best ways to refresh your style and your life ready
   for the arrival of spring? It would have to be revamping your closet,
   having an epic decluttering sessions and freshening up the space you
   store your clothes in. There is a lot to be said for the power of
   organisation to streamline your life, buying lesser and better quality,
   taking care of the things we love, and paring everything back to the
   essentials. Your perfect wardrobe is a matter of individual
   preferences, and matching your clothes to your aesthetic and lifestyle.
   Here’s how to get there in five easy steps…

Organise Your Space

   You may be lucky enough to have a space that you can use as a dressing
   room, or a walk in closet that you can organise exactly how you like.
   The area where you store your most treasured belongings is definitely
   worth some time and effort. Start with the basics like repainting,
   adding shelving or extra rails, buying sturdy shoe racks and the like.
   You want your room to be comfortable so don’t forget things like ac
   unit repair or proper blinds as well.

Declutter What You Have

   Most of us own far too many clothes which never get worn – either stuff
   we have bought in the sales that doesn’t suit or perhaps doesn’t fit,
   things we’ve outgrown or pieces which no longer fit our needs. Commit
   to paring down these items to key pieces and donating things which
   haven’t been worn in months. Then when you have a clearer idea of the
   clothes you really have to house, you can plan out storage solutions
   much better.

Define Your Signature Look

   Anyone who is truly stylish has taken the time to work out a signature
   look which works perfectly for the life they lead, their body shape,
   and how they want to present themselves to the world. Make a list of
   your daily situations, the events you go to, the colors you’re drawn to
   and what qualities you would like to see in your clothes (practical?
   feminine? high quality?). Your style needs to inspire you and allow you
   to express yourself, but also to be appropriate for the life you lead –
   there’s little point in having hundreds of cocktail dresses if you very
   rarely go out at night!

Know What Works For You

   You also want to work out which shapes suit your body and come up with
   two or three combinations that work for you which you can then recreate
   in different colours and finishes. A session with a personal stylist
   can be really useful for this, or find a celebrity with a similar body
   type to yours and take a look at their best outfits for some quick
   inspiration.

Add Interest With Accessories

   Once you have the basics sorted you can add a little flair and
   individuality to your look simply by adding a few accessories. It could
   be a colorful silk scarf or perhaps some delicate layered necklaces.
   Maybe you’re a fan of a statement boot or some showstopping tasselled
   earrings? Work out what makes you happy and expresses your personality
   and go for it!
