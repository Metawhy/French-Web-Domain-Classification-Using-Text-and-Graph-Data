FOR EVERY ORDER WE RECEIVE, 30% OF PROFITS GO DIRECTLY TO THE ORIGINAL
ARTIST/ESTATE or ALIGNING CHARITY

   What sets Third Eye Tapestries apart from other wall tapestry
   distributors and manufactures is our relationship with our artists and
   our belief in the power of giving back to the community. We seek out
   some of the most talented artists around the world to design visionary
   artwork that portrays both realistic and abstract design. The wall
   tapestries we sell portray nature, landscapes, humanity and abstract
   design that will catch the attention of art lovers of all styles and
   interest.  As the brilliant minds, eyes and hands behind our wall
   tapestries, a portion of each sale on an artist’s design is given back
   to the artist. Further, Third Eye Tapestries is partnered with multiple
   charities supporting local artists and wildlife; we would not be able
   to do what we do without the growth and development of artists on our
   beautiful planet and believe that every living being should have the
   chance to thrive.

   IN PARTNERSHIP WITH "ARTISTS STRIVING TO END POVERTY" (ASTEP), EVERY
   TAPESTRY SOLD DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO TRANSFORMING THE LIVES OF
   UNDERSERVED CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD THROUGH THE POWER OF THE ARTS –
   IN A DIRECT AND TANGIBLE WAY EACH MONTH!

   Third Eye Tapestries is known and trusted worldwide for producing
   exquisite wall tapestries from the work of real, talented and
   inspirational artists. We believe that art has the ability to move
   people, inspire people and assist people in finding their true selves;
   we truly desire the opportunity to spread our love of art to people
   across the world. Located in New York, Third Eye Tapestries is a
   worldwide distributor of the finest wall art. In addition, if you enjoy
   festivals and prefer to buy your art in person, Third Eye Tapestries
   travels the world as a vendor at some of the best art and music
   festivals.  We sell our tapestries individually or wholesale for those
   who are looking to completely redecorate a home or office space. If you
   are looking to make your home, office or event truly one-of-kind, we
   can even print your custom art or designs on a wall tapestry so that
   you have a true piece of your personality in your home; we are able to
   make custom prints in a quick turn around with a digital copy of your
   art!
