What is Max?

Max is a visual programming language for the specialized needs of artists,
educators, and researchers working with audio, visual media, and physical
computing.

It's the only software that lets you do all this.

Used worldwide for performances and installations.

Cosmoscope

   Cosmoscope runs from two networked Macs – one controlling the audio and
   other, the lighting system. The Max-based audio operates on 12.4 or 8.2
   discrete channels, depending on the site. The LED animation and display
   system is driven by Clojure and WebGL code, with some custom Max for
   networking to the audio engine.

Anthropocene (Mutek Festival jury prize winner)

   I used some Computer Vision and an unusual way of treating the image,
   creating the illusion of a computer-interface scanning the planet Earth
   and old footage of human interaction with it.
   by Federico Foderaro, Artist, Media Technologist, Teacher

Sound Courtyard

   The 58-speaker system is hidden and includes 32 amplifiers, 3
   soundboards and one main computer running Max. Since the opening in
   2010, artists have created works in which no equipment or technology
   would distract the visitor from a clear vision of the architecture.
   by Jean-Christophe Desnoux and Manuel Poletti, Sound Artists

Espongina

   Espongina is a digital instrument made of water and two carved wooden
   bowls. Waterproof piezos pick up vibrations from movement and physical
   contact with the wood. These vibrations are processed and mapped
   through Max to different parameters that generate and shape sounds
   throughout the performance.
