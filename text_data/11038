Transferring personal data from the EU to the US

   ARVO has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect
   from you will be processed in the United States. The United States has
   not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union
   under Article 45 of the GDPR. ARVO relies on derogations for specific
   situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR. In particular, ARVO
   collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data only: with your
   consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling
   legitimate interest of ARVO in a manner that does not outweigh your
   rights and freedoms. ARVO endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to
   protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it
   only consistent with your relationship with ARVO and the practices
   described in this Privacy Notice. ARVO also enters into data processing
   agreements and model clauses with its vendors whenever feasible and
   appropriate.

The rights you have regarding your personal data

   You have certain individual rights regarding the personal data that
   ARVO collects and processes about you through the website.

   You have the right to access or receive certain information about the
   personal data that ARVO processes about you. You also have the right to
   have your personal data rectified, to object to the processing of your
   personal data or to ask us to restrict processing or delete your
   personal data. Please note, however, that your rights are subject to
   exceptions or derogations. Specifically, we may need to further process
   and retain your personal data to perform a contract with you or your
   company, organization or hospital, or to comply with legal obligations.
   Lastly, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent
   supervisory authority. You may access or receive information about your
   personal data by contacting us at ARVO@arvo.org.

   ARVO is not responsible for content and privacy concerns in non-ARVO
   sites. For further information, please email ARVO with any comments,
   questions or concerns about the ARVO privacy policy or its
   implementation.

Data storage and retention

   ARVO is committed to protecting the security of your Personally
   Identifiable Information. We use commercially reasonable security
   technologies and procedures to protect your Personally Identifiable
   Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. After you have
   submitted your information online to ARVO, we recommend that you end
   your browser session before leaving your computer. In spite of these
   protections, ARVO cannot guarantee the security of any data submitted
   over the Internet. After your information reaches ARVO, however, it is
   stored on servers (or in the case of information received from you in
   person, in writing or over the phone, in physical storage areas)
   protected by procedures and technology designed to block reasonably
   foreseeable intrusions by unauthorized third parties.

   contained in this Privacy Notice and/or any other agreement that we
   might have with you. If you do not agree to any of these terms and
   conditions, you should not use this Site or any ARVO benefits or

   contained in any agreement we may have with you.

   to amend the Privacy Policy at any time, for any reason, without notice
   to you, other than the posting of the amended Privacy Policy at this
   Site. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and terms and
   conditions and will e-mail ARVO members of material changes thereto,

   What are cookies?
   As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site
   uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your
   computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what
   information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to
   store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these
   cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain
   elements of the sites functionality.

   Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit an ARVO website or

   experience that’s consistent with your settings. Cookies also make your

   How we use cookies
   We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately,
   in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling
   cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features
   they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies
   if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used
   to provide a service that you use.

   The cookies we set
   If you create an account with ARVO, then we will use cookies for the
   management of the signup process and general administration. These
   cookies will usually be deleted when you log out however in some cases
   they may remain afterwards to remember your site preferences when
   logged out.

   We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this
   fact. This prevents you from having to log in every single time you
   visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when
   you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and
   areas when logged in.

   This site offers e-commerce or payment facilities and some cookies are
   essential to ensure that your order is remembered between pages so that
   we can process it properly.

   To provide you with a great experience on this site we provide the
   functionality to set your preferences for how this site runs when you
   use it. In order to remember your preferences, we need to set cookies
   so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a
   page is affected by your preferences.

   Here are the types of cookies we use on our websites
     * Authentication: If you're signed in to our services, cookies help
       us show you the right information and personalize your experience.
     * Security: We use cookies to enable and support some of our security
       features, and to help us detect malicious activity.
     * Preferences, features and services: Cookies can help you fill out
       forms on our sites more easily. They also provide you with
       features, insights, and customized content.
     * Marketing: We may use cookies to help us deliver marketing
       campaigns and track their performance (e.g., a user visited our
       Annual Meeting site and then registered).
     * Performance, analytics and research: Cookies help us learn how well
       our sites and services perform. We also use cookies to understand,
       improve, and research products, features, and services, including
       to create logs and record when you access our sites and services
       from different devices, such as your work computer or your mobile
       device.

   Third party cookies
   In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third
   parties. The following section details which third party cookies you
   might encounter through this site.

   This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and
   trusted analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how
   you use the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These
   cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the
   pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.

   Third party analytics are used to track and measure usage of this site
   so that we can continue to produce engaging content. These cookies may
   track things such as how long you spend on the site or pages you visit
   which helps us to understand how we can improve the site for you.

   From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the
   way that the site is delivered. When we are still testing new features,
   these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent
   experience whilst on the site whilst ensuring we understand which
   optimizations our users appreciate the most.

   As we sell products it's important for us to understand statistics
   about how many of the visitors to our site make a purchase and as such
   this is the kind of data that these cookies will track. This is
   important to you as it means that we can accurately make business
   predictions that allow us to monitor our advertising and product costs
   to ensure the best possible price.

   In some cases, we may provide you with custom content based on what you
   tell us about yourself either directly or indirectly by linking to your
   ARVO account. These types of cookies simply allow us to provide you
   with content that we feel may be of interest to you.

   Disabling cookies
   You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on
   your browser. Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the
   functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling
   cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
   features of this site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not
   disable cookies.

   How to enable and disable cookies using your browser
   Most browsers allow you to manage cookie settings. These settings can
   usually be found in the ‘Settings’, ‘Options’ or ‘Preferences’ menu of
   your browser. Some people may prefer to not allow cookies. Most
   browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit your own
   preferences, and, in some browsers, you can set up rules on a
   site-by-site basis, giving you more granular control over your own
   privacy. This means that you can disallow cookies from all sites except
   those that you trust. The links below are provided to help you find the
   settings for some common browsers.
     * Manage cookie settings in Chrome and Chrome Android and Chrome iOS
     * Manage cookie settings in Safari and Safari iOS
     * Manage cookie settings in Firefox
     * Manage cookie settings in Internet Explorer / Edge
     * Manage cookie settings in Opera

   For all other browsers, please look for a “help” function in your
   browser or contact the browser provider.

   More information
   Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously
   mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need
   or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does
   interact with one of the features you use on our site.
