   Hi there folks,

   As you all know first step to any design process (after research and
   required ux) is to try and define the style and visual language that
   will guide the overall look and feel of the website.

   I was tasked to explore various visual directions for TheHub's new
   website. Based on the layouts we had in place i created 3 different
   styles. This is one of the styles discussed with the client.

   Best,
   Martin

   Hey everyone!
   New week — new shot!
   Today we want to share our concept for a file management platform.

   A comfortable way to have access to all your files in one place. Users
   can add all cloud storages like Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud and
   manage them all simultaneously as well as browse files, create, open
   and delete them.

   As a bonus, users can create a team account and share the files with
   other colleagues for the focused, meaningful work of the whole team.
