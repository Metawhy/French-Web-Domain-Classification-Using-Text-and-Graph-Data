The Fourteenth International Conference on Computational Structures
Technology

1 - 3 September 2020 | Palma, Mallorca, Spain

   This is the fourteenth conference in the Computational Structures
   Technology (CST) series that commenced in 1991. The conference is
   concerned with the application of the latest computational technology
   to structural mechanics and engineering. Computational technology
   encompasses both the latest hardware and software developments as well
   as algorithmic and theoretical techniques.

   The conference is also concerned with both theoretical, mathematical
   and scientific developments as well as applications of established
   technology to new domains. The word 'structures' is interpreted in its
   widest sense.

   The conference runs concurrently with the Eleventh International
   Conference on Engineering Computational Technology (ECT). Participants
   may attend sessions from either conference.

   The CST2020 Conference will be opened jointly with the ECT2020
   Conference with a lecture presented by Professor Klaus-Jürgen Bathe of
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA.
