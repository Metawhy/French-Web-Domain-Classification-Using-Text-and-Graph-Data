Malik Yoba Storms Off Set After Being Pressed on Allegations of Soliciting
Sex From a Minor

   Actor Malik Yoba stormed off the set during an on-camera interview with
   The Root Friday after being asked about allegations that he solicited
   sex from a minor who engaged in survival sex work in the late 1990s and
   early 2000s. The walkout was also seemingly triggered by questions
   about his motives for publishing an Instagram post that declared his
   love and attraction for trans women, which has since been deleted.

   During the conversation at The Root’s studios, The Root asked Yoba to
   respond to a Facebook post by Mariah Lopez Ebony, in which she accuses
   the actor of soliciting sex from her at ages 13 and 16. Yoba said, “I
   don’t know the woman,” and “I have no idea who she is.” In a phone
   interview with The Root on Saturday, Lopez, now 34, stood by her
   claims, saying her first sex act with Yoba took place at age 13, and
   the second act occurred at age 16.

   Lopez was born April 27, 1985, so the first sexual act would have
   likely taken place in 1998 and the second act in 2001. Lopez is a
   long-time trans rights activist and executive director of STARR, the
   Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform, founded by trans pioneers
   Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson. Lopez alleges Yoba, now 52, would
   drive around New York’s Greenwich Village area looking for trans women
   to pay for sex.

   Here is an excerpt from Lopez’s Facebook post:

     I started seeing him personally, with my own two eyes, cruising
     around the meatpacking district and Village, large black Jeep,
     looking for Trans fem sex workers, he preferred black trans girls;
     pretty, slim girls, but would pick up a latinx if she was put
     together and/or looked mixed.

     That was close to 20 years ago, and I can still remember it like
     yesterday. i also remember the day a friend of mine said, real cool,
     like she was known to do “.......walk down that block..Just go! He
     wants You.....”. You always remember celebrity clients. It’s like
     time slows down. You remember every detail, Blood pounding. He was
     cute, and polite, don’t get me wrong. But I’m sure he knew what he
     was doing, was Wrong.....

   The first time Lopez claims she had sex with Yoba for pay took place in
   1998 in either the West Village or the Meatpacking District, when an
   adult sex worker escorted her to Yoba’s “larger black SUV or jeep” that
   may have been a Ford Explorer or Excursion. Lopez says the woman who
   took her to Yoba’s vehicle is unwilling to speak publicly for fear of
   legal reprisals for her involvement in the transaction between Yoba and
   Lopez, and that the woman has secured legal counsel. Once Lopez entered
   the car, Yoba handed her $80 for sex. She declined to go into details
   of exactly what took place.

   “I will say, that based on my personal experience in the instance
   you’re inquiring about but also my further knowledge of him personally,
   he has a proclivity for sexual intercourse that is homoerotic,” says
   Lopez.

   Lopez also noted that Yoba wanted to engage in the sex act without
   protection. She further recounts that she normally charged “a bill,” or
   $100, for the act, but that Yoba only had $80 at the time of the
   encounter.

   During the second meeting, Lopez said Yoba parked in the Greenwich
   Village area where she was working, turned off his lights, and stared
   at her, which she says is a common way for clients to pick up sex
   workers. Lopez walked by his car and he told her to get in, she said.

   “When I got in the car and he recognized who I was, he was slightly
   annoyed because I am not necessarily a ‘good ho,’” one who would let
   him dictate the terms of the encounter unchallenged.

   Yoba insisted on picking the route to the location where the act would
   take place, Lopez said. “Sometimes you go in the car and you direct the
   client where to go,” she said. “Not only was he a veteran-ass trick, so
   it was not surprising that he wanted to choose the route; but also just
   being a celebrity, you let them drive always, [and] he had a very
   specific route, a circle of comfort, a zone.”

   Lopez said they ended up in a Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood park, where
   they engaged in a sexual act for pay. Yoba tried to not use protection,
   but Lopez was able to convince him otherwise, she says.

   Another black trans woman, Ja’nese Bussey, who performed sex work with
   Lopez during the late 1990s and early 2000s, told The Root in a
   separate phone interview Saturday that Lopez told her she performed sex
   acts with Yoba for pay soon after the first act took place. Bussey
   confirmed Lopez was 13-years-old at the time. On two occasions, Bussey,
   who says she went by the name “Charisse” during her time as a sex
   worker, said Yoba gave her money in exchange for sex. He also asked her
   if she could find him “teenage girls” for sex, Bussey claims.

   Bussey, 40, said that there was no doubt that Lopez looked underage at
   the time the first alleged sex act with Yoba took place. “She looked
   10,” Bussey added.

   A representative for Yoba said in a statement to The Root that the
   actor “categorically denies all allegations and will not respond,
   beyond this comment, to requests for comment.”

   It is not uncommon for underage trans teens to enter survival sex work
   because their parents often kick them out because they refuse to accept
   their trans identity. Polaris Project finds that the average age of
   entry into sex work is 19-years-old, but that is a general figure that
   is not specific to trans sex workers. Diamond Collier, a board member
   of Black Transwomen Inc., says it is not uncommon for trans children to
   enter sex work at 13 years old and that she herself was faced with a
   choice of entering a group home or doing sex work after she
   transitioned as a teen.

   “In that moment, I was given that option to get into sex work or [go to
   the group home]. So there’s a lot of situations where girls have no
   other options,” said Collier, who also performed sex work, starting at
   age 23 until she was 28. “Trans girls, especially back in the day,
   couldn’t go to shelters that were for guys or girls. They didn’t have
   anywhere to go. And sometimes some of the LGBTQ shelters didn’t take
   you back in the day unless you were HIV-positive. So how the system is
   set up, it forces girls to get in that kind of work.”

   In Yoba’s on-camera interview with The Root, he gave this response to
   Mariah’s Facebook allegations:

   The Root [7:11]: Since creating these posts, you’ve received a mixture
   of support and criticisms. On a more serious note, a trans woman named
   Mariah Lopez Ebony wrote a Facebook post in which she accused you of
   soliciting sex from her as a minor when she was both 13 and 16 years
   old. What do you have to say to this allegation?
   Advertisement

   Yoba [7:34]: I say that, you know, when I heard that, and I actually
   didn’t read it until last Thursday, what she actually said, I don’t
   know the woman, number one…

   The Root [7:44]: So, you’re saying you never met her, you don’t know
   her?

   Yoba [7:47]: That’s exactly what I am saying. I don’t know her. I have
   no idea who she is. I am familiar with that pain, I’m familiar with
   that trauma. I’m familiar with people who are crying out for help. I’m
   familiar with the lack of regard for this population, which is, again,
   my point. So, when I heard it, for me, to hear something so heinous,
   right, number one, and to see someone post something with no proof of
   anything and to see the world embrace it, or a portion of the world
   embrace it, that toxicity, speaks exactly to the reason I do the work
   that I do.

   So, it’s an oxymoron almost. It’s like wow, the first cis-gender man
   who stands up for the community and gets attacked by that community.
   But that’s true for anybody that’s ever stood up for oppressed people.
   It’s happened to Gandhi. It’s happened to Mandela. It’s happened to
   Marcus Garvey. It’s happened to Malcolm X. It’s happened to anyone who
   has said, ‘I am gonna stand up for these oppressed people.’ Think about
   who we are, right? There was a time we couldn’t drink from water
   fountains, we couldn’t sit on the bus. Think about how ridiculous that
   is. And so, for me, having a view of a community that I grew up with
   and seeing the suffering. The very thing that motivates me to help
   people out of it is something someone tried to accuse me of…

   When The Root tried to interject, Yoba interrupted.

   Yoba [9:11]: I wanna finish the point. So, the point is to be on the
   other side of that tells me that the work has to continue and the
   blessing will be greater because the truth will always outweigh a lie.
   Right? So the truth is people are suffering. The truth is there are
   kids in the street. Right? But the other truth is for my entire life, I
   am someone who has been working with young people since I was 16 years
   old, making sure that there are better pathways for other people, so,
   that’s a very loaded question for you to ask me that and we discussed
   that before.

   At this point in the interview, it was emphasized that Yoba and The
   Root had established an understanding during an initial Sept. 16
   conversation regarding the allegations between Yoba and senior reporter
   Terrell Jermaine Starr, as well as the negative perceptions of him in
   the trans community. A wider conversation about his activism and his
   upcoming projects were also discussed in that meeting with Yoba and his
   publicists, and it was stated that these issues would be discussed in
   the Sept. 20 interview.

   The interview took a turn when The Root asked Yoba if he worried people
   would perceive his answer to the assault allegations as centering
   himself.

   Yoba [10:17]: Yeah, you know, um, this is a bullet wound. Right? We’re
   on 45th Street and Broadway. I got shot five blocks from here at the
   age of 15. Right? A quarter of an inch over I would have been paralyzed
   from the neck down. A half-inch over I’d be dead. So, since January 18,
   1983, I’ve never taken a second for granted to be alive. I can’t even
   count how many people who are no longer here I grew up with that I’ve
   known. Numbers? I don’t even know how many it is. Right? And so life is
   precious and each moment is precious. So for someone who has long
   understood the power of thought and the power of intention, the ability
   to manifest my life the way I’ve wanted to. I never had a job I didn’t
   want. I’ve never had to work just to make money. Every single thing
   I’ve done in my life, whether I was a bike messenger, you know, working
   with young people, making movies, TV, working in education, working
   with the criminal justice system, working environment, working with
   fathers. Any social issue, professional pursuit, every single thing
   I’ve done it’s because it’s an intention. And I followed the intention
   and I chased the purpose, right?

   And so, to stand up in the face of someone saying that you’re this when
   I know I am this, I also felt, Wow. That’s kinda how it feels like to
   be transgender [12:14]. Right? Can you imagine walking into the world,
   looking the way you and I do, but feeling inside that something is not
   lining up and you need to address that. The way you present in the
   world and you don’t look so good.
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:30]: I don’t think I could ever or anybody who is
   cisgender could ever place themselves in a trans person’s position.

   Yoba [12:37]: I think we can because I had to do it on New York
   Undercover. So, on New York Undercover, we did an episode where people
   were killing transgender people. So we actually had to dress and go
   into the world…
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:50]: That’s fiction, though. That’s not real life.

   Yoba [12:53]: Yeah, but you’re missing my point. You’re making your
   point. The point that I’m making is that you asked me what does it feel
   like to stand up in the face of this. And I’m telling you that if I am
   this and someone is calling me this, that is akin to a transgender
   woman being called a man.
   Advertisement

   The Root [13:14]: Do you really make that comparison?

   Yoba [13:17]: I do. You may not make it but I’m making the comparison
   because I sat in it. I know what it’s like for people to try and yell
   at me and tell me I’m gay, to tell me I’m a pedophile, to tell me what
   I’m not. And I have to stand up to that. And the only thing I can do is
   stand up with the truth. And, so, when you feel that pain, when you
   walk down the street and people are basically saying, ‘Fuck you’ and
   you still walk on your purpose, that’s empowering. As painful as it is,
   it’s also empowering. And so when I talk to my transgender friends and
   they have people tell them what they’re not and they’re telling you
   that they are, that’s painful for them too.
   Advertisement

   So if I am gonna be the person, the first one, to stand up and take the
   hits. I know what it feels like and I feel I have the right to say,
   yes, as I stand alongside you, I do understand your pain. Not on an
   intellectual level but on an experiential level. I was walking down the
   street the other and someone said ‘Happy Birthday, AIDS victim.’ They
   screamed that out of a window to me. I lost work because of this, just
   like trans people. I have people look at me sideways just like trans
   people. I have people calling me gay, just like trans people. So I have
   the right to tell you exactly how it feels if I choose to stand up with
   these folks that I love and appreciate and consider part of my
   humanity. And I can tell you what it feels like.

   The Root went on to ask Yoba about allegations from trans sex workers
   who claimed that he solicited sex from them. Yoba replied that he
   didn’t know what the reporter was talking about. When asked how he
   reacts to criticisms that he does not actually care for trans people
   and that he fetishizes trans women, Yoba became demonstrably upset.

   Yoba walked away from his chair, threw his microphone to the floor,
   yelled “fuck you” to this reporter and the production team and demanded
   that he be given the SD video cards that recorded the interview, which
   The Root’s producers refused to do.

   Witnesses to Yoba’s profanity-laced meltdown were two video producers
   for The Root, two people representing Yoba, his 18-year-old daughter,
   and The Root’s senior video producer. Yoba’s publicists and The Root’s
   video producers tried to calm him down, but Yoba continued cursing
   until he finally left the studio.

   Yoba is scheduled to co-host a workshop leading up to the Trans
   National Visibility March this Thursday amid criticisms that his
   presence and the allegation by Lopez will take up space that is
   supposed to be focused on trans people. Trans activists have expressed
   concerns to The Root that Yoba has not demonstrated adequate knowledge
   to speak on behalf of trans issues and that his public statements are
   designed to elevate himself at trans people’s expense.

   Collier says that she was very proud of Yoba when he published his
   Instagram post expressing his love for trans women and the need for
   more black men to follow his lead. But she is not familiar with any of
   his work in the trans community during her 20 years of national
   organizing.

   “Conversations around Malik Yoba have centered around his participation
   in consenting adult sex work,” Collier said. “In the community, he is
   known to be a client. He’s known to be a nice guy. He’s known to be
   somebody that fetishizes us. I haven’t heard anything bad. Mariah was
   the first story that was weird and bad.”

   In media interviews, Yoba has mentioned Tiq Milan, a black trans
   activist in New York City, as someone who he has spoken to about trans
   issues. Milan, who is a trans man, told The Root that he could not
   speak to Yoba’s activism in the trans community and that he has only
   known him for a month after reaching out to thank him for his Instagram
   post. Despite the negative perceptions Milan has heard about Yoba, he
   said it was important for the actor to speak out.
   Advertisement

   “I think Malik’s story is important,” Milan said. “I also think that it
   is a part of a larger conversation about the culture of lovelessness
   around transgender people, the homicide rate of black transgender women
   and expanding our outlook and definitions of love, desire, and
   masculinity.”

   Many trans women have gone on social media to question Yoba’s sincerity
   and motives. Sharon L. Cooks, a transgender woman who works as a
   business consultant in Philadelphia, said in a Facebook video that
   Yoba’s recent statements of being attracted to trans women are a
   publicity stunt.
   Advertisement

   “Let’s be very clear on what’s going on here,” Cooks said in her video.
   “Where was Malik in the ’90s when it wasn’t so popular? Where was Malik
   Yoba when he was 26 and he was liking women of trans experience? Where
   was he?”

   In a statement to The Root, organizers of the Trans National Visibility
   March said that Yoba was not directly involved with the march, adding:

     “We do respect the fact that Malik Yoba stood out to support himself
     and men like him. There currently is not a visible platform for
     trans amorous men and the work that Malik Yoba is doing is
     necessary. However, we believe that our work should be
     intersectional and that includes bridging the gaps and making space
     for other identities to be visible. It is not our duty to create
     space for them at this time when we are creating a visible space for
     ourselves. As leaders, it is our duty to be intersectional in our
     work and not exclusionary. We have a duty to fight for the
     liberation of all people but we must first stand for ourselves and
     heal. This is why we march!”

   Advertisement

   Still, Collier is concerned that the national attention Yoba has
   brought to the trans community may be doing more harm than good.

   “You have a community that is ravaged with ridicule,” said Collier, who
   is the creator and host of the podcast Marsha’s Plate. “You have people
   doing comedy specials ridiculing us on the public mainstage. You have
   people burning us up in cars. It is a community that is in desperation
   for somebody. And it can be anybody, somebody stepping up and proud of
   loving us, being friends with us, being an ally with us. We kind of
   automatically prop them up in a position of admiration, in a position
   of bravery, a position of gratitude. We appreciate them doing that.
   Advertisement

   “But the problem with that is a lot of people who want to be allies,
   who want to be partners with us in this activism work, don’t have the
   cultural competency to actually do the work in a way that is not
   harmful. So when I saw those videos and I saw what was happening on the
   (Breakfast Club interview), it seemed like [Yoba] and the host were not
   socially equipped to handle the level of conversation that’s needed to
   push the culture forward when it comes to black trans people, black
   trans love, and particularly black trans women. They don’t have the
   experience. He’s done work with his career. He’s done work around
   himself. But in regards to our particular community, he’s not doing
   work. I don’t believe that at all.”

   The Root editor Angela Bronner Helm contributed reporting to this
   story.

   Illustration for article titled The Best Way to Clean Your AirPods
   Photo: Shutterstock

   In a recent issue of the Recomendo newsletter, Mark Frauenfelder
   suggested a three-tool kit for cleaning earwax out of the mesh screen
   of your AirPods. My AirPods were in dire need of a deep clean, and the
   cleaning method we once recommended on Lifehacker is just gross, so I
   ran out and bought the wax-loosening tiny brushes, wax-catching poster
   putty and work-checking magnifying light Frauenfelder recomendo’ed.

   I’m here to report that this method is indeed effective, but I’d like
   to modify it. Save a couple bucks on the brushes and use an old
   toothbrush to loosen the wax, then go to town with the poster putty.
   There is little more satisfying than lifting loosened earwax from a
   mesh screen with a gummy—but not so gummy it gets caught in the
   screen!—wad of putty that you then throw away. (Suffice it to say this
   is a project best done in private, kind of like zit popping.)

   Advertisement

   Instead of the magnifying light, which is nifty but not essential if
   you’ve got decent eyesight, I’d recommend taking a cotton swab and
   dampening it ever-so-slightly with 70% rubbing alcohol and running it
   gently over the plastic parts of the buds and the top crevices of the
   case to remove whatever’s built up there. Apple sanctions this method
   but cautions against getting any liquid in the charging ports or any of
   the openings on either pods or case, so swab at your own risk.

   I find Recomendo to be a spiritual cousin of Lifehacker and nearly
   always take away some smart bit of advice from the newsletter—you
   should definitely subscribe. (And subscribe to Lifehacker’s newsletter
   while you’re at it!)

Malik Yoba Storms Off Set After Being Pressed on Allegations of Soliciting
Sex From a Minor

   Actor Malik Yoba stormed off the set during an on-camera interview with
   The Root Friday after being asked about allegations that he solicited
   sex from a minor who engaged in survival sex work in the late 1990s and
   early 2000s. The walkout was also seemingly triggered by questions
   about his motives for publishing an Instagram post that declared his
   love and attraction for trans women, which has since been deleted.

   During the conversation at The Root’s studios, The Root asked Yoba to
   respond to a Facebook post by Mariah Lopez Ebony, in which she accuses
   the actor of soliciting sex from her at ages 13 and 16. Yoba said, “I
   don’t know the woman,” and “I have no idea who she is.” In a phone
   interview with The Root on Saturday, Lopez, now 34, stood by her
   claims, saying her first sex act with Yoba took place at age 13, and
   the second act occurred at age 16.

   Lopez was born April 27, 1985, so the first sexual act would have
   likely taken place in 1998 and the second act in 2001. Lopez is a
   long-time trans rights activist and executive director of STARR, the
   Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform, founded by trans pioneers
   Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson. Lopez alleges Yoba, now 52, would
   drive around New York’s Greenwich Village area looking for trans women
   to pay for sex.

   Here is an excerpt from Lopez’s Facebook post:

     I started seeing him personally, with my own two eyes, cruising
     around the meatpacking district and Village, large black Jeep,
     looking for Trans fem sex workers, he preferred black trans girls;
     pretty, slim girls, but would pick up a latinx if she was put
     together and/or looked mixed.

     That was close to 20 years ago, and I can still remember it like
     yesterday. i also remember the day a friend of mine said, real cool,
     like she was known to do “.......walk down that block..Just go! He
     wants You.....”. You always remember celebrity clients. It’s like
     time slows down. You remember every detail, Blood pounding. He was
     cute, and polite, don’t get me wrong. But I’m sure he knew what he
     was doing, was Wrong.....

   The first time Lopez claims she had sex with Yoba for pay took place in
   1998 in either the West Village or the Meatpacking District, when an
   adult sex worker escorted her to Yoba’s “larger black SUV or jeep” that
   may have been a Ford Explorer or Excursion. Lopez says the woman who
   took her to Yoba’s vehicle is unwilling to speak publicly for fear of
   legal reprisals for her involvement in the transaction between Yoba and
   Lopez, and that the woman has secured legal counsel. Once Lopez entered
   the car, Yoba handed her $80 for sex. She declined to go into details
   of exactly what took place.

   “I will say, that based on my personal experience in the instance
   you’re inquiring about but also my further knowledge of him personally,
   he has a proclivity for sexual intercourse that is homoerotic,” says
   Lopez.

   Lopez also noted that Yoba wanted to engage in the sex act without
   protection. She further recounts that she normally charged “a bill,” or
   $100, for the act, but that Yoba only had $80 at the time of the
   encounter.

   During the second meeting, Lopez said Yoba parked in the Greenwich
   Village area where she was working, turned off his lights, and stared
   at her, which she says is a common way for clients to pick up sex
   workers. Lopez walked by his car and he told her to get in, she said.

   “When I got in the car and he recognized who I was, he was slightly
   annoyed because I am not necessarily a ‘good ho,’” one who would let
   him dictate the terms of the encounter unchallenged.

   Yoba insisted on picking the route to the location where the act would
   take place, Lopez said. “Sometimes you go in the car and you direct the
   client where to go,” she said. “Not only was he a veteran-ass trick, so
   it was not surprising that he wanted to choose the route; but also just
   being a celebrity, you let them drive always, [and] he had a very
   specific route, a circle of comfort, a zone.”

   Lopez said they ended up in a Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood park, where
   they engaged in a sexual act for pay. Yoba tried to not use protection,
   but Lopez was able to convince him otherwise, she says.

   Another black trans woman, Ja’nese Bussey, who performed sex work with
   Lopez during the late 1990s and early 2000s, told The Root in a
   separate phone interview Saturday that Lopez told her she performed sex
   acts with Yoba for pay soon after the first act took place. Bussey
   confirmed Lopez was 13-years-old at the time. On two occasions, Bussey,
   who says she went by the name “Charisse” during her time as a sex
   worker, said Yoba gave her money in exchange for sex. He also asked her
   if she could find him “teenage girls” for sex, Bussey claims.

   Bussey, 40, said that there was no doubt that Lopez looked underage at
   the time the first alleged sex act with Yoba took place. “She looked
   10,” Bussey added.

   A representative for Yoba said in a statement to The Root that the
   actor “categorically denies all allegations and will not respond,
   beyond this comment, to requests for comment.”

   It is not uncommon for underage trans teens to enter survival sex work
   because their parents often kick them out because they refuse to accept
   their trans identity. Polaris Project finds that the average age of
   entry into sex work is 19-years-old, but that is a general figure that
   is not specific to trans sex workers. Diamond Collier, a board member
   of Black Transwomen Inc., says it is not uncommon for trans children to
   enter sex work at 13 years old and that she herself was faced with a
   choice of entering a group home or doing sex work after she
   transitioned as a teen.

   “In that moment, I was given that option to get into sex work or [go to
   the group home]. So there’s a lot of situations where girls have no
   other options,” said Collier, who also performed sex work, starting at
   age 23 until she was 28. “Trans girls, especially back in the day,
   couldn’t go to shelters that were for guys or girls. They didn’t have
   anywhere to go. And sometimes some of the LGBTQ shelters didn’t take
   you back in the day unless you were HIV-positive. So how the system is
   set up, it forces girls to get in that kind of work.”

   In Yoba’s on-camera interview with The Root, he gave this response to
   Mariah’s Facebook allegations:

   The Root [7:11]: Since creating these posts, you’ve received a mixture
   of support and criticisms. On a more serious note, a trans woman named
   Mariah Lopez Ebony wrote a Facebook post in which she accused you of
   soliciting sex from her as a minor when she was both 13 and 16 years
   old. What do you have to say to this allegation?
   Advertisement

   Yoba [7:34]: I say that, you know, when I heard that, and I actually
   didn’t read it until last Thursday, what she actually said, I don’t
   know the woman, number one…

   The Root [7:44]: So, you’re saying you never met her, you don’t know
   her?

   Yoba [7:47]: That’s exactly what I am saying. I don’t know her. I have
   no idea who she is. I am familiar with that pain, I’m familiar with
   that trauma. I’m familiar with people who are crying out for help. I’m
   familiar with the lack of regard for this population, which is, again,
   my point. So, when I heard it, for me, to hear something so heinous,
   right, number one, and to see someone post something with no proof of
   anything and to see the world embrace it, or a portion of the world
   embrace it, that toxicity, speaks exactly to the reason I do the work
   that I do.
   Advertisement

   So, it’s an oxymoron almost. It’s like wow, the first cis-gender man
   who stands up for the community and gets attacked by that community.
   But that’s true for anybody that’s ever stood up for oppressed people.
   It’s happened to Gandhi. It’s happened to Mandela. It’s happened to
   Marcus Garvey. It’s happened to Malcolm X. It’s happened to anyone who
   has said, ‘I am gonna stand up for these oppressed people.’ Think about
   who we are, right? There was a time we couldn’t drink from water
   fountains, we couldn’t sit on the bus. Think about how ridiculous that
   is. And so, for me, having a view of a community that I grew up with
   and seeing the suffering. The very thing that motivates me to help
   people out of it is something someone tried to accuse me of…

   When The Root tried to interject, Yoba interrupted.

   Yoba [9:11]: I wanna finish the point. So, the point is to be on the
   other side of that tells me that the work has to continue and the
   blessing will be greater because the truth will always outweigh a lie.
   Right? So the truth is people are suffering. The truth is there are
   kids in the street. Right? But the other truth is for my entire life, I
   am someone who has been working with young people since I was 16 years
   old, making sure that there are better pathways for other people, so,
   that’s a very loaded question for you to ask me that and we discussed
   that before.

   At this point in the interview, it was emphasized that Yoba and The
   Root had established an understanding during an initial Sept. 16
   conversation regarding the allegations between Yoba and senior reporter
   Terrell Jermaine Starr, as well as the negative perceptions of him in
   the trans community. A wider conversation about his activism and his
   upcoming projects were also discussed in that meeting with Yoba and his
   publicists, and it was stated that these issues would be discussed in
   the Sept. 20 interview.

   The interview took a turn when The Root asked Yoba if he worried people
   would perceive his answer to the assault allegations as centering
   himself.
   Advertisement

   Yoba [10:17]: Yeah, you know, um, this is a bullet wound. Right? We’re
   on 45th Street and Broadway. I got shot five blocks from here at the
   age of 15. Right? A quarter of an inch over I would have been paralyzed
   from the neck down. A half-inch over I’d be dead. So, since January 18,
   1983, I’ve never taken a second for granted to be alive. I can’t even
   count how many people who are no longer here I grew up with that I’ve
   known. Numbers? I don’t even know how many it is. Right? And so life is
   precious and each moment is precious. So for someone who has long
   understood the power of thought and the power of intention, the ability
   to manifest my life the way I’ve wanted to. I never had a job I didn’t
   want. I’ve never had to work just to make money. Every single thing
   I’ve done in my life, whether I was a bike messenger, you know, working
   with young people, making movies, TV, working in education, working
   with the criminal justice system, working environment, working with
   fathers. Any social issue, professional pursuit, every single thing
   I’ve done it’s because it’s an intention. And I followed the intention
   and I chased the purpose, right?

   And so, to stand up in the face of someone saying that you’re this when
   I know I am this, I also felt, Wow. That’s kinda how it feels like to
   be transgender [12:14]. Right? Can you imagine walking into the world,
   looking the way you and I do, but feeling inside that something is not
   lining up and you need to address that. The way you present in the
   world and you don’t look so good.
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:30]: I don’t think I could ever or anybody who is
   cisgender could ever place themselves in a trans person’s position.

   Yoba [12:37]: I think we can because I had to do it on New York
   Undercover. So, on New York Undercover, we did an episode where people
   were killing transgender people. So we actually had to dress and go
   into the world…
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:50]: That’s fiction, though. That’s not real life.

   Yoba [12:53]: Yeah, but you’re missing my point. You’re making your
   point. The point that I’m making is that you asked me what does it feel
   like to stand up in the face of this. And I’m telling you that if I am
   this and someone is calling me this, that is akin to a transgender
   woman being called a man.
   Advertisement

   The Root [13:14]: Do you really make that comparison?

   Yoba [13:17]: I do. You may not make it but I’m making the comparison
   because I sat in it. I know what it’s like for people to try and yell
   at me and tell me I’m gay, to tell me I’m a pedophile, to tell me what
   I’m not. And I have to stand up to that. And the only thing I can do is
   stand up with the truth. And, so, when you feel that pain, when you
   walk down the street and people are basically saying, ‘Fuck you’ and
   you still walk on your purpose, that’s empowering. As painful as it is,
   it’s also empowering. And so when I talk to my transgender friends and
   they have people tell them what they’re not and they’re telling you
   that they are, that’s painful for them too.
   Advertisement

   So if I am gonna be the person, the first one, to stand up and take the
   hits. I know what it feels like and I feel I have the right to say,
   yes, as I stand alongside you, I do understand your pain. Not on an
   intellectual level but on an experiential level. I was walking down the
   street the other and someone said ‘Happy Birthday, AIDS victim.’ They
   screamed that out of a window to me. I lost work because of this, just
   like trans people. I have people look at me sideways just like trans
   people. I have people calling me gay, just like trans people. So I have
   the right to tell you exactly how it feels if I choose to stand up with
   these folks that I love and appreciate and consider part of my
   humanity. And I can tell you what it feels like.

   The Root went on to ask Yoba about allegations from trans sex workers
   who claimed that he solicited sex from them. Yoba replied that he
   didn’t know what the reporter was talking about. When asked how he
   reacts to criticisms that he does not actually care for trans people
   and that he fetishizes trans women, Yoba became demonstrably upset.

   Yoba walked away from his chair, threw his microphone to the floor,
   yelled “fuck you” to this reporter and the production team and demanded
   that he be given the SD video cards that recorded the interview, which
   The Root’s producers refused to do.

   Witnesses to Yoba’s profanity-laced meltdown were two video producers
   for The Root, two people representing Yoba, his 18-year-old daughter,
   and The Root’s senior video producer. Yoba’s publicists and The Root’s
   video producers tried to calm him down, but Yoba continued cursing
   until he finally left the studio.

   Yoba is scheduled to co-host a workshop leading up to the Trans
   National Visibility March this Thursday amid criticisms that his
   presence and the allegation by Lopez will take up space that is
   supposed to be focused on trans people. Trans activists have expressed
   concerns to The Root that Yoba has not demonstrated adequate knowledge
   to speak on behalf of trans issues and that his public statements are
   designed to elevate himself at trans people’s expense.

   Collier says that she was very proud of Yoba when he published his
   Instagram post expressing his love for trans women and the need for
   more black men to follow his lead. But she is not familiar with any of
   his work in the trans community during her 20 years of national
   organizing.

   “Conversations around Malik Yoba have centered around his participation
   in consenting adult sex work,” Collier said. “In the community, he is
   known to be a client. He’s known to be a nice guy. He’s known to be
   somebody that fetishizes us. I haven’t heard anything bad. Mariah was
   the first story that was weird and bad.”

   In media interviews, Yoba has mentioned Tiq Milan, a black trans
   activist in New York City, as someone who he has spoken to about trans
   issues. Milan, who is a trans man, told The Root that he could not
   speak to Yoba’s activism in the trans community and that he has only
   known him for a month after reaching out to thank him for his Instagram
   post. Despite the negative perceptions Milan has heard about Yoba, he
   said it was important for the actor to speak out.
   Advertisement

   “I think Malik’s story is important,” Milan said. “I also think that it
   is a part of a larger conversation about the culture of lovelessness
   around transgender people, the homicide rate of black transgender women
   and expanding our outlook and definitions of love, desire, and
   masculinity.”

   Many trans women have gone on social media to question Yoba’s sincerity
   and motives. Sharon L. Cooks, a transgender woman who works as a
   business consultant in Philadelphia, said in a Facebook video that
   Yoba’s recent statements of being attracted to trans women are a
   publicity stunt.
   Advertisement

   “Let’s be very clear on what’s going on here,” Cooks said in her video.
   “Where was Malik in the ’90s when it wasn’t so popular? Where was Malik
   Yoba when he was 26 and he was liking women of trans experience? Where
   was he?”

   In a statement to The Root, organizers of the Trans National Visibility
   March said that Yoba was not directly involved with the march, adding:

     “We do respect the fact that Malik Yoba stood out to support himself
     and men like him. There currently is not a visible platform for
     trans amorous men and the work that Malik Yoba is doing is
     necessary. However, we believe that our work should be
     intersectional and that includes bridging the gaps and making space
     for other identities to be visible. It is not our duty to create
     space for them at this time when we are creating a visible space for
     ourselves. As leaders, it is our duty to be intersectional in our
     work and not exclusionary. We have a duty to fight for the
     liberation of all people but we must first stand for ourselves and
     heal. This is why we march!”

   Advertisement

   Still, Collier is concerned that the national attention Yoba has
   brought to the trans community may be doing more harm than good.

   “You have a community that is ravaged with ridicule,” said Collier, who
   is the creator and host of the podcast Marsha’s Plate. “You have people
   doing comedy specials ridiculing us on the public mainstage. You have
   people burning us up in cars. It is a community that is in desperation
   for somebody. And it can be anybody, somebody stepping up and proud of
   loving us, being friends with us, being an ally with us. We kind of
   automatically prop them up in a position of admiration, in a position
   of bravery, a position of gratitude. We appreciate them doing that.

   “But the problem with that is a lot of people who want to be allies,
   who want to be partners with us in this activism work, don’t have the
   cultural competency to actually do the work in a way that is not
   harmful. So when I saw those videos and I saw what was happening on the
   (Breakfast Club interview), it seemed like [Yoba] and the host were not
   socially equipped to handle the level of conversation that’s needed to
   push the culture forward when it comes to black trans people, black
   trans love, and particularly black trans women. They don’t have the
   experience. He’s done work with his career. He’s done work around
   himself. But in regards to our particular community, he’s not doing
   work. I don’t believe that at all.”

   The Root editor Angela Bronner Helm contributed reporting to this
   story.

   Photo: Shutterstock

   In a recent issue of the Recomendo newsletter, Mark Frauenfelder
   suggested a three-tool kit for cleaning earwax out of the mesh screen
   of your AirPods. My AirPods were in dire need of a deep clean, and the
   cleaning method we once recommended on Lifehacker is just gross, so I
   ran out and bought the wax-loosening tiny brushes, wax-catching poster
   putty and work-checking magnifying light Frauenfelder recomendo’ed.

   I’m here to report that this method is indeed effective, but I’d like
   to modify it. Save a couple bucks on the brushes and use an old
   toothbrush to loosen the wax, then go to town with the poster putty.
   There is little more satisfying than lifting loosened earwax from a
   mesh screen with a gummy—but not so gummy it gets caught in the
   screen!—wad of putty that you then throw away. (Suffice it to say this
   is a project best done in private, kind of like zit popping.)

   Advertisement

   Instead of the magnifying light, which is nifty but not essential if
   you’ve got decent eyesight, I’d recommend taking a cotton swab and
   dampening it ever-so-slightly with 70% rubbing alcohol and running it
   gently over the plastic parts of the buds and the top crevices of the
   case to remove whatever’s built up there. Apple sanctions this method
   but cautions against getting any liquid in the charging ports or any of
   the openings on either pods or case, so swab at your own risk.

   I find Recomendo to be a spiritual cousin of Lifehacker and nearly
   always take away some smart bit of advice from the newsletter—you
   should definitely subscribe. (And subscribe to Lifehacker’s newsletter
   while you’re at it!)

How to Block Unwanted Emails, Phone Calls, and Messages in iOS 13

   Calls, and Messages in iOS 13

   Is your iPhone getting blown up with spammy messages? Then you should
   probably update to iOS 13 if you haven’t already. iOS 13 includes a
   couple of new tools for blocking junk emails and robocalls, and carries
   over the iMessage blocking options from iOS 12. These make it easy to
   filter out unwanted messages at the source—whether from specific
   contacts or en masse. Even better, any numbers or email addresses you
   block from an iPhone will be blocked on your other Apple devices as
   well. Here’s how:

Blocking unwanted email

    1. First, you can block specific contacts from the iOS Mail app by
       opening a message and tapping the sender’s email address. Tap
       “Block This Contact” button.
    2. Next, go to Settings > Mail and turn on “Ignore Blocked Senders.”
    3. You can also go to Settings > Mail > Blocked to add to/manage your
       list of blocked contacts.

   Advertisement

Blocking unknown callers

   Go to Settings > phone and turn on “Silence Unknown Callers.” This
   disables ringing and notifications for calls from unknown numbers which
   should cut down on spam and robocalls, but be aware this could also
   block important calls from numbers you don’t have saved. It would be
   smart to turn this off if you’re expecting an important phone call from
   a number you don’t know or don’t have saved.

Blocking iMessage contacts

   While you’ve technically been able to block contacts in iMessage since
   iOS 12, the method for blocking is quite similar to blocking email
   addresses and phone numbers. Under Settings > Messages, turn on “Filter
   unknown senders.” Just be mindful that this will prevent you from
   seeing messages from all unknown senders, much like when blocking
   unknown numbers, so be careful about when you have this setting
   enabled, and be sure to check your folder of filtered messages if
   you’re expecting to hear from someone.

   Phone Spam

   It’s the Year of the Robocall, it seems. I haven’t noticed this
   directly, but a number of friends, colleagues, and internet posters
   seem to be inundated with bullshit phone calls now more than ever
   before. What great times we live in, where anyone with an auto-dialer
   can blast out millions of calls to people who don’t want to hear about
   scammy vacation offers or other nonsense.

   While we all wait for STIR and SHAKEN certificates to take off, you
   should take a few moments to make sure you’ve done everything you can
   to prevent robocalls from reaching you. It’s a Sisyphean task, but you
   have to stay on top of it—for your sanity. Here are a few of our
   suggestions:

There’s an app for that

   There are plenty of apps you can use to block phone calls, which
   typically work by identifying spammy numbers others have already been
   hit with and preemptively blocking them before it’s your turn. They
   aren’t perfect, but they offer a reasonable first line of defense
   against annoyances.

   Advertisement

   I’ve been a huge fan of Hiya (Android, iOS) for years, as I’ve found
   its free version does a solid job of keeping the robocalls down. Make
   sure you’re updating its database at regular intervals (as in, whenever
   you get an annoying call or two), and make sure you’ve set up the app
   so that it’s automatically blocking problematic numbers and “neighbor
   scams,” or spoofed numbers that look a lot like your number, instead of
   just warning you about them.

   Phone Spam

   I also like WideProtect and Mr. Number for iOS and Android,
   respectively, which lets you block numbers beginning with whatever
   prefixes you want. If you’re getting a lot of calls from an area code
   that isn’t yours, and you don’t know anyone with that number, just
   block the whole thing.

   You can also try paying for apps like Robokiller, which might work well
   for you, but I’d give the free options a shot, first. It’s annoying to
   have to pay a monthly fee to not be annoyed.

   Advertisement

Check your wireless carrier for spam-blocking features

   If your wireless carrier offers free spam identification and blocking
   features or apps, there’s no harm in giving them a shot. These features
   might not work very well, but they’re better than nothing:
     * Verizon ($2.99/mo)
     * AT&T (Free)
     * T-Mobile (Free-$4/mo)
     * Sprint ($2.99/mo)

Try that “Do Not Call” Registry, but don’t get your hopes up

   Sure, you can sign up for the Federal Trade Commission’s “Do Not Call”
   registry, but you’re still going to get spammed. We’ve reached the
   point where it’s easier for scammers to blast out phone numbers and
   either not get caught, or get such positive results that getting caught
   isn’t much of a deterrent. Either way, this registry exists, and you
   can sign up for it—since even a placebo can help you feel better—but
   don’t get stressed out when it doesn’t work.

   Advertisement

   Oh, and while you’re there, feel free to file some complaints about
   spam calls you receive. They probably won’t do anything, either, but
   doing so might improve your mood slightly. If you’re getting spam
   texts, forward those to #7726.

Whitelist Your Contacts

   If you’re an iOS user, you can take the somewhat-extreme step of using
   Do Not Disturb as a sort-of whitelist for your iPhone. Pull up the
   Settings app and tap on Do Not Disturb. Flip it on, don’t give it a
   schedule (since you’re just going to leave it on), and tap the “Allow
   Calls From” section to select “All Contacts.” You’ve now effectively
   silenced all phone calls save for those from the people already in your
   iPhone’s Contacts app. However, you also won’t receive message
   notifications or app notifications—like your email—which can be
   problematic.

   Advertisement

   You can use the same trick on Android (via Settings > Sound > Do Not
   Disturb), and you have a lot more control over the kinds of
   notifications you want to receive. In other words, you can keep getting
   notifications about messages, events, and reminders, but block incoming
   calls unless they’re from people on your contact list. While you’re at
   it, don’t forget to flip on Android’s built-in caller ID & spam
   feature.

   Phone Spam

   Advertisement

   For a more robust solution, install the app Tasker and try using this
   Redditor’s ingenious plug-in, which pushes all calls to voicemail
   unless they’re in your smartphone’s contacts. (You can also try
   creating your own, a skill worth learning!)

Consider switching to Google Voice

   Google is more than happy to give you a free phone number. While
   signing up for one isn’t going to stop spam calls from blowing up your
   phone, giving this out as your new primary number instead of your real
   phone number might help you lessen the load a bit—especially if you use
   Google Voice’s call screening and forwarding features. If you see that
   your Google Voice number is calling you, but the caller doesn’t
   announce who they are when you pick up, you’re probably safe to send
   that one to voicemail.

If You Just Bought a New Apple Device, You Get Free Apple TV+

   Nick Douglas
   Yesterday 3:15pm
   Filed to:TV

   If you bought a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac after
   September 10 this year, then you can get a free year of Apple TV+
   (normally $5/month). The streaming service launches November 1, after
   which you’ll have three months to activate your free year in the Apple
   TV app. (If you buy a new device after November 1, you’ll have three
   months from the purchase date to activate.)

   TV+ launches with a slate of original shows and films, including The
   Morning Show, which is like ... daytime Newsroom? See more trailers on
   Apple’s site.

   Advertisement

   After your free year, TV+ will auto-renew for a month at $5. To cancel
   without missing some of your free subscription, set a calendar alert
   for a couple of days before your free year runs out, and include a link
   to the cancellation page.

   If you already intended to pay for the streaming service, then consider
   this a $60 discount on a device purchase. On the $150 Apple TV, that’s
   actually a consideration. But don’t use this to justify a new iPhone.

   Details for the deal are available on the Apple TV+ page and in this
   PDF.

I'm Josh Ocampo, Lifehacker Staff Writer, and This Is How I Work

   Josh Ocampo
   Today 10:00am
   Filed to:how we work

   Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces, and productivity tips
   of our favorite experts. This week, we’re going behind the scenes at
   Lifehacker. I’m Josh Ocampo, and this is how I work.

   Location: Manhattan
   Current Gig: Staff writer at Lifehacker
   Current mobile device: iPhone X
   Current computer: MacBook Pro at home
   One word that best describes how you work: Caffeinated

First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where
you are today.

   My first job out of college was on the business side of a record label,
   handling payments and contracts. I got laid off, and on a whim got a
   job in the legal department of a magazine publisher. I worked my way
   into the business side of a few magazines—which means I processed a lot
   of invoices—and eventually started writing. While writing
   professionally, I was laid off two more times and now I’m here at
   Lifehacker (and very knowledgable about the New York State unemployment
   process).

Take us through a recent workday.

   My day starts at night. At around midnight, I’m usually searching for
   story ideas and Slack them to myself. I have an RSS feed set up through
   Feedly, but I usually make it a point to read/skim headlines on the New
   York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and check Twitter and Reddit. (I’m a
   frequent user in r/Politics and r/Fitness.)

   I wake up around 7:45 a.m., feed my cat, and look for more story ideas
   and watch the news⁠ on ⁠NY1. If I have time, I’ll also watch the Today
   Show or Good Morning America (or watch Watch What Happens reruns from
   the night before). I’m lucky that I live close to the office, so I can
   usually leave at 9 on the dot and get in within 20 minutes. By 9:30, I
   usually have a good game plan for my day and start researching and
   writing.

What apps, gadgets, or tools can’t you live without?

     * Flipboard
     * Reddit
     * Rover
     * Soundprint
     * Underway
     * Netvue
     * Plague, Inc.
     * PS4

What’s your workspace setup like?

   Since we’ve only been at our new office for a few months, I don’t have
   much and most of the things on my desk don’t belong to me, aside from
   the laptop and sign in the back I made for the Climate Strike. (I work
   from all over the office, so my desk setup isn’t a big deal to me.)

   The books you see were sent to our remote editors. The keyboard on the
   right was sitting on my desk when I got here (and possibly belonged to
   BET staff, who occupied this space before us). And the sickly plant
   (named Brian) belongs to our deputy editor Alice. I can assure you he
   is thriving now!

   Honestly, I’m just very grateful to have a work laptop. At one of my
   first writing gigs, I had an enormous desktop computer and my personal
   laptop was on its very last limb. I’m very happy to have the ability to
   physically move and still work. (It’s the little things.)

What’s your favorite shortcut or hack?

   This isn’t groundbreaking, but I have a lot of Google alerts set up for
   story ideas and particular phrases (maybe 25+?). When I worked at Mic,
   we had a column called “Food and Politics,” which was devoted to
   politicians’ eating behaviors (lol). Google alerts really came in handy
   here because it wasn’t like the New York Times reported on what Beto
   O’Rourke ate that week.

Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place
at work.

   I get up a lot from my desk and take a walk to the kitchen or grab a
   coffee before I submit most stories. I can develop a one-track mind
   when I’m writing and I think it’s helpful to get some perspective. By
   the time I’m back at my desk, I can more clearly edit/decide when
   things aren’t making sense. If I’m able to, I’ll wait until the next
   morning to edit something just for more clarity.

Who are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them?

   Goes without saying, but my editors. I’m very in my head when I write
   and can be self-critical. I’ll reach out if I’m deep in a hole I can’t
   crawl out of myself; usually it’s because I’m so caught up in details
   that probably don’t make sense/impact the outcome of the story.
   I fed goats on a farm in Hawaii for an assignment last year and was
   very excited about it (but not as excited as the goats).

How do you recharge or take a break?

   I eat or have more coffee. I’ve also very recently gotten into
   album/song reaction videos on YouTube. I can’t adequately describe why
   they’re so great but it’s fun to hear people respond to albums for the
   first time that you love so much. I’ll listen to one while I’m
   struggling with a story or just want a little break.

   Outside of work, I take a half-hour nap every day. It’s life-changing.

What are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?

   I’m in the middle of Michelle Obama’s memoir right now and plan to read
   Pete Buttigieg’s Shortest Way Home next (or Abbi Jacobson from Broad
   City’s I Might Regret This; can’t decide). I very recently re-read
   Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential (which I love) and finished
   Stephanie Danler’s Sweetbitter.

Can you share a music playlist you’ve made, whether for working or elsewhere?

   I don’t have public playlists, but a few songs currently on rotation:
     * Banks “Gimme”
     * Marina and the Diamonds “Karma”
     * Gabrielle Aplin “Kintsugi”
     * Alabama Shakes “This Feeling” (thanks, Fleabag!)

Who else would you like to see answer these questions?

   Nathan Fielder or my cat.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?

   “Don’t tell people that you’re willing to work long hours because
   they’ll take advantage of it.”

What’s a problem you’re still trying to solve?

   How little sleep I can survive on without compromising my ability to
   think rationally.

Update to iOS 13.1 Now

   iOS 13's launch was, frankly, a bit of a mess—so much so that we, and
   plenty of others, even recommended iOS users wait a bit before
   upgrading. Thankfully, you don’t have to hold out any longer: Apple
   began rolling out the iOS 13.1 patch, meaning the time to upgrade is
   finally here. And for those who already made the jump to iOS 13,
   today’s version update fixes several bugs and smooths the OS’s
   performance for an overall better experience.

   Here’s everything that iOS 13.1 adds, fixes, or changes:
     * Numerous stability tweaks and bug fixes, including a fix for the
       privacy location bug found in the initial iOS 13 build.
     * Updated dynamic wallpapers, which are also now available on all
       iPhone models (were previously iPhone 11-exclusive)
     * A new “ETA Share” option in Apple Maps, plus an update to Maps’
       “collections” feature that will alert you before deleting entire
       collections
     * An “Automations” tab has been re-added to Shortcuts
     * New Airdrop interface for iPhone 11 models
     * A new “Reading Goals” toggle in Apple Books
     * A new Airpods icon will be displayed in the volume controls
       interface when connected.
     * Battery display icons for wirelessly connected game controllers
     * New icon the denote beta apps
     * Updated system font settings
     * Updates to video and audio codec support

   These add to iOS 13's other previously released features, such as a new
   system-wide dark mode, new Airpod features, and more. iOS 13.1 should
   be available for all users soon, though the exact rollout schedule
   varies. You can check for new updates by going to Settings > General >
   Software Update on your iPhone. If you were in the iOS 13.1 beta,
   you’ll need to roll back to receive the stable version of the update.
