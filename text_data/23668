Elliott School Extends Sympathy to Family, Friends of Dr. Janne Nolan

   The Elliott School extends its deepest sympathy to family and friends
   at the passing of our dear colleague, Dr. Janne Nolan.

   Nolan was a research professor and led the Nuclear Security Working
   Group for many years at the Elliott School.

   Her lifetime dedication to national and nuclear security and
   proliferation policy made her an invaluable figure in bridging the
   partisan divide and contributing to the formation and implementation of
   a nuclear security policy.

   “Nolan’s contributions to nuclear security policy cannot be
   understated. We will miss her dearly, and her voice will live on and
   her influence will continue to impact the world,” said Reuben Brigety,
   dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs.

   BA Candidate, International Affairs

     "My research has focused on the social effects of desertification
     and drought. Through conversations with local professors, livestock
     famers, and government officials my hope is to propose policy
     solutions to desertification in the Sahel, a region in Africa."
