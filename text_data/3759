   How To Get A Working Visa In Japan
   Want to get a working visa in Japan? It's not as easy as it sounds --
   and the last thing you want is to get stranded on a tourist visa with
   no hopes of finding a sponsor, so doing some research beforehand will
   save you a lot of time and heartache. While we can't cover every
   possible situation, this article should help guide you in the right
   direction.
   The first thing you need to know is that working visas are only allowed
   for certain jobs and industries in Japan. Don't expect to get a working
   visa by flipping burgers at McDonald's; it's more complicated than
   that. Even a friend of ours who's a hairdresser ran into a complete
   roadblock when she got to Japan, with no salons willing to sponsor her
   for a visa no matter how much they wanted to hire her. Basically, Japan
   only wants you if you're able to do high-level work. In most cases,
   you'll need to have a university or 3-10 years of experience, depending
   on the field.
   It's possible to get around the university degree requirement,
   especially if you have a job lined up, so don't give up hope if you
   don't have a diploma. Life will be much harder for you until you find
   that first company willing to employ you, though.
   Anyway -- before getting your visa, the first thing you'll need is a
   certification of eligibility. To obtain that, you'll need a sponsor in
   Japan, so the next step is finding an employer that'll sponsor you.
   There are plenty of sites out there where you can browse job offers
   from companies in Japan. If you know enough Japanese to look up
   recruitment information yourself and send a Japanese-style resumes to
   the companies you're interested in, ever better. So send out
   applications, but make sure to brush up on Japanese business manners,
   too. A good grasp of the language and local manners will go a long way
   to improve the impression you're giving off.
   Now, you've probably heard of foreigners who somehow managed to sponsor
   their own working visas. It IS possible, but you'll have to put some
   serious effort into it. Basically, you'll have to prove that you have
   the means to support yourself in Japan and won't end up in trouble.
   More concretely, that means proving to the government that you're
   making a certain amount of money per month. If you're working, say, two
   part-time jobs, you'll have to get signed documents from your employers
   stating how much you're making. This can even work in the case of
   freelance work like private English lessons; just have your students
   sign contracts that state the period they'll be taking lessons for and
   the amount they'll be paying you. If you can't prove you're making
   money, forget about sponsoring your own visa. And even if you DO have
   all your papers in order, immigration bureau employees may be reticent
   or have no idea what you're trying to do. Good Japanese skills and tons
   of determination are your best allies there.
   If you have little professional experience, no university degree, and
   don't speak Japanese, your best bet might be exchange programs such as
   the JET Program. Sucking it up and teaching English for a couple of
   years isn't most people's ideas of a good time, but it'll get you a
   foot in the door, at least. Once one company has sponsored you to work
   in Japan, it's easier to find (better) work.
   Finally, don't forget that working visas are bound to the type of work
   you're doing -- if you get one and then switch fields, you'll need to
   change your visa as well.
   Good luck and ganbatte!
