Ocean Pollution: The Dirty Facts

   We’re drowning marine ecosystems in trash, noise, oil, and carbon
   emissions.
   January 22, 2018 Melissa Denchak

   Paulo Oliveira/Alamy

   Covering more than 70 percent of our planet, oceans are among the
   earth’s most valuable natural resources. They govern the weather, clean
   the air, help feed the world, and provide a living for millions. They
   also are home to most of the life on earth, from microscopic algae to
   the blue whale, the largest animal on the planet. Yet we’re bombarding
   them with pollution. By their very nature—with all streams flowing to
   rivers, all rivers leading to the sea—the oceans are the end point for
   so much of the pollution we produce on land, however far from the
   coasts we may be. And from dangerous carbon emissions to choking
   plastic to leaking oil to constant noise, the types of ocean pollution
   humans generate are vast. As a result, collectively, our impact on the
   seas is degrading their health at an alarming rate. Here are some ocean
   pollution facts that everyone on our blue planet ought to know.

Ocean Acidification

   When we burn fossil fuels, we don’t pollute just the air but the
   oceans, too. Indeed, today’s seas absorb as much as a quarter of all
   man-made carbon emissions, which changes the pH of surface waters and
   leads to acidification. This problem is rapidly worsening—oceans are
   now acidifying faster than they have in some 300 million years. It’s
   estimated that by the end of this century, if we keep pace with our
   current emissions practices, the surface waters of the ocean could be
   nearly 150 percent more acidic than they are now.

   Oregon State University

   So what happens when the ocean’s chemistry is knocked out of whack?
   Marine ecosystems—and the coastal economies that depend on them—go out
   of whack, too. Take reefs and shellfish, for starters. To build their
   shells and skeletons, creatures like mussels, clams, coral, and oysters
   require calcium carbonate (the same compound found in chalk and
   limestone). But the ocean’s carbonate levels go down when acidity
   levels rise, threatening the survival of these animals. Bivalves are at
   the bottom of the food chain, so these effects ripple up to many fish,
   seabirds, and marine mammals. More-acidic waters also contribute to the
   bleaching of coral reefs and make it harder for some types of fish to
   sense predators and for others to hunt prey.

   Meanwhile, ocean acidification threatens us land-dwellers, too. The
   billion-dollar American shellfish industry is the economic backbone of
   myriad coastal communities, from Louisiana to Maine to Maryland.
   Already, declining harvests linked to more-acidic waters are estimated
   to have cost the Pacific Northwest’s oyster industry nearly $110
   million and 3,200 jobs.

Trash in the Ocean

   The majority of the garbage that enters the ocean each year is
   plastic—and here to stay. That’s because unlike other trash, the
   single-use grocery bags, water bottles, drinking straws, and yogurt
   containers, among eight million metric tons of the plastic items we
   toss (instead of recycle), won’t biodegrade. Instead, they can persist
   in the environment for a millennium, polluting our beaches, entangling
   marine life, and getting ingested by fish and seabirds.

   Where does all this debris originate? While some is dumped directly
   into the seas, an estimated 80 percent of marine litter makes its way
   there gradually from land-based sources―including those far inland―via
   storm drains, sewers, and other routes. (An excellent reason why we
   should all reduce plastic pollution, no matter where we live.) Oil from
   boats, airplanes, cars, trucks, and even lawn mowers is also swimming
   in ocean waters. Chemical discharges from factories, raw sewage
   overflow from water treatment systems, and stormwater and agricultural
   runoff add other forms of marine-poisoning pollutants to the toxic
   brew.

Tell your senators to save our marine monuments

Take Action

Ocean Noise

   The ocean is far from a “silent world.” Sound waves travel farther and
   faster in the sea’s dark depths than they do in the air, and many
   marine mammals like whales and dolphins, in addition to fish and other
   sea creatures, rely on communication by sound to find food, mate, and
   navigate. But an increasing barrage of human-generated ocean noise
   pollution is altering the underwater acoustic landscape, harming—and
   even killing—marine species worldwide.

   Anngu Chen/EyeEm

   Consider the incessant din of the roughly 60,000 commercial tanker and
   container ships that ply the seas at any given time. The underwater
   racket that results creates a kind of “smog” that reaches nearly every
   corner of the ocean and shrinks the sensory range of marine wildlife.
   High-intensity sonar used by the U.S. Navy for testing and training
   causes some of the same effects—and has been linked to mass whale
   strandings, too.

   Meanwhile, in the hunt for offshore oil and gas, ships equipped with
   high-powered air guns fire compressed air into the water every 10 to 12
   seconds for weeks to months on end. Traveling as far as 2,500 miles,
   these deafening seismic blasts disrupt foraging, mating, and other
   vital behaviors of endangered whales (and may ultimately push some,
   such as the North Atlantic right whale, to extinction). The blasts lead
   some commercial fish species to abandon their habitat—a direct hit on
   coastal economies dependent on catch rates; they also injure and kill
   marine invertebrates, including scallops, crabs, and squid.

Stop the assault on whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals

Take Action

Offshore Drilling

   In addition to noise pollution, the oil and gas industry’s routine
   operations emit toxic by-products, release high levels of greenhouse
   gases, and lead to thousands of spills in U.S. waters annually. That
   oil can linger for decades and do irreversible damage to delicate
   marine ecosystems. Take the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker spill in Alaska’s
   Prince William Sound, from which oil still remains, or the BP Deepwater
   Horizon offshore drilling disaster in 2010, which spread millions of
   gallons of oil throughout the Gulf of Mexico. But even smaller spills
   pollute the ocean (and the air) with long-lasting impacts. Even the
   most advanced cleanup efforts remove only a fraction of the oil, and
   sometimes they use hazardous technologies. Chemical dispersants used in
   the largest spill response efforts—1.8 million gallons were released
   into the Gulf after the BP disaster—are dangerous pollutants
   themselves.

Tell Trump to trash his offshore drilling plan once and for all

Take Action

Ocean Pollution and You

   The fate of our seas is not only up to the government or industry. Our
   individual, daily actions matter, too. You can start by reducing water
   pollution and runoff at home, being more mindful of your plastic
   consumption, or organizing a cleanup of your local waterway. You can
   also support the work of NRDC and other environmental advocacy groups
   as well as other businesses and organizations that work to preserve our
   coasts and waters.

Fossil Fuels: The Dirty Facts

   Mining, drilling, and burning dirty energy are harming the environment
   and our health. Here’s everything you need to know about fossil fuels,
   and why we need to embrace a clean energy future.

   Sakhorn Saengtongsamarnsin/123RF

   For more than a century, burning fossil fuels has generated most of the
   energy required to propel our cars, power our businesses, and keep the
   lights on in our homes. Even today, oil, coal, and gas provide for
   about 80 percent of our energy needs.

   And we’re paying the price. Using fossil fuels for energy has exacted
   an enormous toll on humanity and the environment—from air and water
   pollution to global warming. That’s beyond all the negative impacts
   from petroleum-based products such as plastics and chemicals. Here’s a
   look at what fossil fuels are, what they cost us (beyond the wallet),
   and why it’s time to move toward a clean energy future.

What Are Fossil Fuels?

   Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are all considered fossil fuels
   because they were formed from the fossilized, buried remains of plants
   and animals that lived millions of years ago. Because of their origins,
   fossil fuels have a high carbon content.

Examples of Fossil Fuels

Oil

   Crude oil, or petroleum (literally “rock oil” in Latin), is a liquid
   fossil fuel made up mostly of hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon
   compounds). Oil can be found in underground reservoirs; in the cracks,
   crevices, and pores of sedimentary rock; or in tar sands near the
   earth’s surface. It’s accessed by drilling, on land or at sea, or by
   strip mining in the case of tar sands oil and oil shale. Once
   extracted, oil is transported to refineries via supertanker, train,
   truck, or pipeline to be transformed into usable fuels such as
   gasoline, propane, kerosene, and jet fuel—as well as products such as
   plastics and paint.

   Petroleum products supply about 37 percent of U.S. energy needs, with
   the transportation sector consuming the most. U.S. oil consumption in
   2016 was 10 percent below the record high of 2005 and only 3 percent
   higher than during the 1973–74 embargo by the Organization of the
   Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)—despite the U.S. economy tripling
   in size in the decades since. However, oil use has increased modestly
   for the past four years, as relatively low gasoline prices have fueled
   a rise in vehicle miles traveled and renewed interest in SUVs and light
   trucks. Still, U.S. consumption of petroleum products is forecast to
   decrease, at least through 2035, as fuel efficiency standards lead to
   cleaner-running vehicles. Continued strengthening of clean car and fuel
   economy standards remains critical for reducing oil consumption.

   On the production side, the United States has experienced a decadelong
   upswing. Production growth is due in large part to improvements in
   horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, technologies that have
   created a boom in U.S. shale oil and natural gas extraction. While
   horizontal drilling enables producers to drill down and outward—thus
   reaching more oil or gas from a single well—hydraulic fracturing (also
   known as fracking) is designed to extract oil or natural gas from
   unyielding rock, including shale and other formations. Fracking
   involves blasting huge quantities of water mixed with chemicals and
   sand deep into a well, at pressures high enough to fracture rock and
   enable the oil or gas to escape. This controversial method of
   extraction creates a host of environmental and health problems,
   including air and water pollution.

Coal

   Coal is a solid, carbon-heavy rock that comes in four main varieties
   differentiated largely by carbon content: lignite, sub-bituminous,
   bituminous, and anthracite. Nearly all of the coal burned in the United
   States is sub-bituminous or bituminous. Found in abundance in states
   including Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, these
   coal types are middle of the pack in terms of carbon content and the
   heat energy they can produce. Regardless of variety, however, all coal
   is dirty. Indeed, in terms of emissions, it’s the most carbon-intensive
   fossil fuel we can burn.

   Coal is extracted via two methods: Underground mining uses heavy
   machinery to cut coal from deep underground deposits, while surface
   mining (also known as strip mining) removes entire layers of soil and
   rock to access coal deposits below. Strip mining accounts for about
   two-thirds of coal sourced in the United States. Although both forms of
   mining are detrimental to the environment, strip mining is particularly
   destructive, uprooting and polluting entire ecosystems.

   Coal and the power plants that burn it account for less than a third of
   U.S. electricity generation, down from more than half in 2008. Cleaner,
   cheaper alternatives—including natural gas, renewables like solar and
   wind, and energy-efficient technologies—make coal far less economically
   attractive. Today, coal-fired power plants continue to close, despite
   the Trump administration’s promises of a revived industry. Future
   demand for coal is expected to remain flat or to fall as market forces
   propel alternative energy sources forward.

Natural gas

   Composed mostly of methane, natural gas is generally considered either
   conventional or unconventional, depending on where it’s found
   underground. Conventional natural gas is located in porous and
   permeable rock beds or mixed into oil reservoirs and can be accessed
   via standard drilling. Unconventional natural gas is essentially any
   form of gas that is too difficult or expensive to extract via regular
   drilling, requiring a special stimulation technique, such as fracking.

   In the United States, the development and refinement of processes like
   fracking have helped make the country the world’s top producer of
   natural gas since 2009—and the biggest consumer of it, too. Abundant in
   the United States, natural gas covers nearly 30 percent of U.S. energy
   needs and is the largest source of energy for electricity. Forecasts
   suggest it will become an even greater part of the U.S. energy mix
   through 2050, threatening to exacerbate air and water pollution.

Disadvantages of Fossil Fuels

Land degradation

   Unearthing, processing, and moving underground oil, gas, and coal
   deposits take an enormous toll on our landscapes and ecosystems. The
   fossil fuel industry leases vast stretches of land for infrastructure
   such as wells, pipelines, access roads, as well as facilities for
   processing, waste storage, and waste disposal. In the case of strip
   mining, entire swaths of terrain—including forests and whole
   mountaintops—are scraped and blasted away to expose underground coal or
   oil. Even after operations cease, the nutrient-leached land will never
   return to what it once was.

   As a result, critical wildlife habitat—land crucial for breeding and
   migration—ends up fragmented and destroyed. Even animals able to leave
   can end up suffering, as they’re often forced into less-than-ideal
   habitat and must compete with existing wildlife for resources.

Water pollution

   Coal, oil, and gas development pose myriad threats to our waterways and
   groundwater. Coal mining operations wash acid runoff into streams,
   rivers, and lakes and dump vast quantities of unwanted rock and soil
   into streams. Oil spills and leaks during extraction or transport can
   pollute drinking water sources and jeopardize entire freshwater or
   ocean ecosystems. Fracking and its toxic fluids have also been found to
   contaminate drinking water, a fact that the Environmental Protection
   Agency was slow to recognize.

   Meanwhile, all drilling, fracking, and mining operations generate
   enormous volumes of wastewater, which can be laden with heavy metals,
   radioactive materials, and other pollutants. Industries store this
   waste in open-air pits or underground wells that can leak or overflow
   into waterways and contaminate aquifers with pollutants linked to
   cancer, birth defects, neurological damage, and much more.

Don't let the Trump administration pollute our drinking water

Take Action

Emissions

   Fossil fuels emit harmful air pollutants long before they’re burned.
   Indeed, some 12.6 million Americans are exposed daily to toxic air
   pollution from active oil and gas wells and from transport and
   processing facilities. These include benzene (linked to childhood
   leukemia and blood disorders) and formaldehyde (a cancer-causing
   chemical). A booming fracking industry will bring that pollution to
   more backyards, despite mounting evidence of the practice’s serious
   health impacts. Mining operations are no better, especially for the
   miners themselves, generating toxic airborne particulate matter. Strip
   mining—particularly in places such as Canada’s boreal forest—can
   release giant carbon stores held naturally in the wild.

Burning Fossil Fuels

Global warming pollution

   When we burn oil, coal, and gas, we don’t just meet our energy needs—we
   drive the current global warming crisis as well. Fossil fuels produce
   large quantities of carbon dioxide when burned. Carbon emissions trap
   heat in the atmosphere and lead to climate change. In the United
   States, the burning of fossil fuels, particularly for the power and
   transportation sectors, accounts for about three-quarters of our carbon
   emissions.

Other forms of air pollution

   Fossil fuels emit more than just carbon dioxide when burned. Coal-fired
   power plants singlehandedly generate 42 percent of dangerous mercury
   emissions in the United States, as well as two-thirds of U.S. sulfur
   dioxide emissions (which contribute to acid rain) and the vast majority
   of soot (particulate matter) in our air. Meanwhile, fossil fuel–powered
   cars, trucks, and boats are the main contributors of poisonous carbon

Ocean acidification

   When we burn oil, coal, and gas, we change the ocean’s basic chemistry,
   making it more acidic. Our seas absorb as much as a quarter of all
   man-made carbon emissions. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution
   (and our coal-burning ways), the ocean has become 30 percent more
   acidic. As the acidity in our waters goes up, the amount of calcium
   carbonate—a substance used by oysters, lobsters, and countless other
   marine organisms to form shells—goes down. This can slow growth rates,
   weaken shells, and imperil entire food chains.

   Ocean acidification impacts coastal communities as well. In the Pacific
   Northwest, it’s estimated to have cost the oyster industry millions of
   dollars and thousands of jobs.

Building a Clean Energy Future

   We’re not locked into a fossil fuel future, however. We’ve made major
   progress in scaling up renewable energy and energy efficiency in the
   United States over the past decade, thanks to federal, state, and local
   policies that have helped to grow the clean energy economy. We’re also
   using energy much more efficiently than we used to.

   State and federal incentives, along with falling prices, are pushing
   our nation—and the world—toward cleaner, renewable energy sources such
   as wind and solar. Renewables are on track to become a cheaper source
   of energy than fossil fuels, which is spurring a boom in clean energy
   development and jobs. Significantly higher levels of renewables can be
   integrated into our existing grid, though care must be taken to site
   and build renewable energy responsibly.

   Meanwhile, energy efficiency is our cleanest, cheapest, and largest
   energy resource, contributing more to the nation’s energy needs over
   the past 40 years than oil, coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. It
   accounts for more than 2.2 million U.S. jobs—at least 10 times more
   than oil and gas drilling or coal mining.

   If we can put the right policies in place, we are poised to make
   dramatic progress toward a clean energy future. In fact, a recent NRDC
   report finds that we can slash U.S. fossil fuel use by 80 percent by
   2050. To do that, we will need to cut energy demand in half, grow
   renewable energy resources so that they provide at least 80 percent of
   our power, electrify almost all forms of transportation, and get fossil
   fuels out of our buildings. That will require sustained, coordinated
   policy efforts from all levels of government, the private sector, and
   local communities. But we know we can do it using the proven,
   demonstrated clean energy technologies that we have today.
