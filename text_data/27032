       training… I really feel that my trainee year has been 360 degrees.

Cornelia Ehrenberg
       Team Lead, Munich
     * I have done everything from travelling to India and Taiwan to help
       out with the implementation of a new invoicing system to presenting
       projects to a division’s CFO in Boston. At an early stage, I felt
       that I had a direct impact on the organization.

Claes Aldén
       Finance Manager, Hult USA
     * I have the opportunity to pair working in technology with the
       incredible mission of breaking down boundaries in culture,
       language, and geography. I think that’s phenomenal.
