Amazon wins a pair of patents for wireless wristbands that track warehouse
workers

   GeekWire Summit: Details for attendees

   track a warehouse worker’s position in relation to a given inventory
   bin. (Amazon Illustration via USPTO)

   Update for 9:30 a.m. PT Feb. 5: Amazon released the following statement
   about its patents for a wristband tracking system, saying that such a
   device is aimed at making it easier for warehouse workers to do their
   jobs.

     “The speculation about this patent is misguided. Every day at
     companies around the world, employees use handheld scanners to check
     inventory and fulfill orders. This idea, if implemented in the
     future, would improve the process for our fulfillment associates. By
     moving equipment to associates’ wrists, we could free up their hands
     from scanners and their eyes from computer screens.”

   Amazon, like many companies, routinely files high-tech patents
   exploring the frontiers of technology. As we’ve pointed out previously,
   many of those patents undergo significant refinement before a product
   is brought to market, and many more never come to fruition. For
   example, there are no smartphone airbag systems or drone-dispensing
   airship warehouses on the horizon. So breathe easy: Amazon won’t be
   using wristbands to track employees’ bathroom breaks anytime soon..

   Previously: Amazon has been issued a pair of patents for a wristband
   system that monitors whether warehouse workers are putting their hands
   in the right places.

   The patents, published today, cover bracelets that could emit
   ultrasonic sound pulses or radio transmissions to let a receiver system
   get a fix on where the workers’ hands are, in relation to an array of
   inventory bins.

   Amazon doesn’t typically comment on its patents, but if the technology
   makes economic sense, it could conceivably be picked up for use in the
   Seattle-based online retailer’s hundreds of fulfillment centers.

   This isn’t the first time the concept has come to light: When the
   applications for the patents were published last fall, there was a
   spate of stories about “buzzing wristbands that bosses can use to track
   workers and order them around.”

   It’s true that the idea of wearing a monitoring bracelet evokes a
   modicum of creepiness, akin to the idea of wearing an ankle bracelet
   during house arrest. But you won’t find a hint of that in the patent
   documents. The concept is laid out instead as a labor-saving measure:

     “Existing approaches for keeping track of where inventory items are
     stored … may require the inventory system worker to perform time
     consuming acts beyond placing the inventory item into an inventory
     bin and retrieving the inventory item from the inventory bid, such
     as pushing a button associated with the inventory bin or scanning a
     barcode associated with the inventory bin. … Accordingly, improved
     approaches for keeping track of where an inventory item is stored
     are of interest.”

   The patents, filed in 2016, suggest that the wristbands provide a
   no-muss, no-fuss method for verifying that the correct items are being
   processed. The inventors say the system circumvents the need for
   “computationally intensive and expensive” monitoring by means of
   computer vision, a la Amazon Go.

   And the inventors know their way around computer vision: The patent for
   the ultrasonic wristband was filed by Jonathan Cohn, senior technical
   program manager for Amazon Go. The radio-frequency wristband system was
   proposed by Tye Brady, chief technologist for Amazon Robotics.
   Radio-based wristband system This diagram illustrates how sensors could
   track the position of a wristband that sends out radio signals. (Amazon
   Illustration via USPTO)

   The system’s sensors triangulate on the wristband’s signals to
   determine where a worker’s hand is positioned, and software matches
   that position with the inventory item that’s supposed to be processed.

   In addition to picking up signals, the system could send signals back,
   setting the band abuzz with a burst of “haptic feedback” to let workers
   know their hands are heading for the right bin.

   It’s not clear if or when Amazon might actually turn the wristband
   concept into a reality. But since Amazon employs tens of thousands of
   workers at its fulfillment centers, it doesn’t take much to guess where
   the system could be put into effect. So if boxes of wristbands start
   turning up at a warehouse near you, be sure to let us know.

   The buzz around Joe Coffee keeps building.

   The Seattle startup, which built a mobile order and rewards app for
   local and independent coffee retailers to compete with big chains such
   as Starbucks, has closed another funding round, bringing in $750,000
   from Seattle’s Flying Fish Partners. The company has raised $1.7
   million to date and is poised to expand to its second market this fall.

   Joe Coffee allows coffee lovers to order quickly and easily from their
   smartphones and its service is being used by more than 200 locations in
   Seattle, with a pace to double that by the end of October, including
   through the addition of regional chains Caffe Ladro and Top Pot
   Doughnuts.

shops through tech to compete with Starbucks

   Armed with what they’ve learned in their own backyard, co-founder Nick
   Martin said expansion is targeting the Los Angeles market by September,
   and combined with the Seattle market, they aim to serve 1,000
   locations.

   “It was important for us to be be careful not to grow faster than we
   could promise a trustworthy and consistent experience for consumers,”
   Martin said. “We built a lot of below-the-surface tech that allows us
   to monitor the quality of end-user experience down to the store level
   in real time. This has enabled us to make well-informed decisions on
   new features and functionality for all three major stakeholders in our
   marketplace: owners/operators, baristas, and consumers.”

   Founded in 2014, Joe Coffee has worked over the past several months to
   make good on its key promise to consumers who place an order through
   their app: a drink will be ready when they arrive at a shop. Martin
   said the margin for error is much smaller than with “on-demand” apps
   that focus on delivery scenarios.

   “From the time you place an order to the time you expect your drink
   and/or snack to be ready for pickup is between 3 and 7 minutes before
   the perception of that experience begins to suffer,” Martin said. “The
   data tells us that if that experience breaks down just once early in
   the consumer lifecycle, it’s hard to get them back.”

   Monitoring the integrity of its network partner by partner, acting on
   insights in real time and fixing broken consumer experiences
   immediately is a cornerstone to the startup’s plans to scale.

   Along with that focus on making sure the consumer experience is top
   notch, Joe Coffee is now beginning to add more features to the
   app around gamification, targeted re-engagement, share-worthy elements
   and leveraging data to provide a more tailored experience for users.

   New funding will also help bolster sales and support staff to keep up
   with demand in Seattle and add support for the L.A. market as well,
   according to Martin.

  New petition implores Microsoft to make foldable Surface Duo a true Windows

   The new Microsoft Surface Duo — the surprising foldable device powered
   by Android that marks the tech giant’s return to the smartphone market
   — is not quite Microsoft enough for some fans.

   Just a few days after the unveiling of the new device, which isn’t
   coming out until the 2020 holiday season, a petition popped up on
   change.org asking for a Windows-powered version of Surface Duo.
   Microsoft revealed a new operating system, Windows 10X, to power the
   new foldable tablet/laptop hybrid Surface Neo. And the petition wants
   that operating system expanded to Surface Duo as well, making it a true
   successor to the beloved, but ultimately failed, Windows Phone.

   “The newly announced Surface Duo running Android ONLY does not
   accomplish what many windows UWP developers and Microsoft fans want,”
   according to the petition. “We want a Surface Duo device that runs the
   new Windows 10x OS and that emulates Android apps.”

   The petition had a approximately 1,150 signatures as of early Monday
   morning, with a goal of getting 1,500.

   Microsoft’s past flameout in the smartphone market is well-documented.
   Windows Phone gained a cult following, however it failed to capture
   enough of an audience to challenge iOS and Android.

   Microsoft wants to avoid that issue this time around by partnering with
   Google to bring Android to the Surface Duo. The tech giant is betting
   not that it can become a dominant player in the mobile OS category, but
   that its hardware teams can design a better foldable phone than rivals
   like Samsung and Huawei.

   The petition, which appeals directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and
   product chief Panos Panay, urges the company to bring Windows 10X to
   the Surface Duo to create a version of the operating system that works
   across all platforms. Without a Windows mobile operating system, the
   company hasn’t been able to accomplish that, according to the petition.

   “Because there are many developers still out here that want to write
   Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that run on all form factors.
   When UWP was announced you promised one code base to run on any form
   factor … including phones and other small form factor “pocketable”
   devices,” according to the petition. “Many developers, both on the
   consumer and enterprise sides of things, still really, really want to
   target small form factor devices with UWP, it’s just that there doesn’t
   exist any since you killed Lumia!”

   Microsoft has slowly moved away from Windows as the flagship of the
   company in favor of cloud computing and other fast-growing businesses.
   However, Microsoft did recently note that there are more than 900
   million devices on Windows 10, and the lineup of new and refreshed
   gadgets displayed at the big Surface event last week is sure to give
   that number a jolt in the coming months.
