                      Natural Dog Food
                      Our Natural range comes in a variety of flavours and
                      contains ingredients for certain life stages.
                      Specially balanced diets for Weaning Puppies to
                      Senior Dogs and those with intolerances requiring a
                      more specialised diet.
                      Working Dog Food
                      Our Working Dog Range comes in a variety of
                      flavours, each one contains a slightly higher
                      percentage of protein and Vitamin C. All recipes in
                      this range include vegetables and fruit ensuring
                      they are nutritionally balanced and complete - no
                      added supplements needed.
                      Pure Dog Food
                      A complementary food. Designed for those who like to
                      make their own recipes at home, this is pure British
                      Meat with raw bone.
                      Probiotic Treatment
                      Zoolac Probiotic Treatment stabilises the digestion
                      and balances the bacterial flora in the intestinal
                      tract by working with the good bacteria and the
                      animal's own immune system. Containing several types
                      of good and naturally-occurring bacteria, the
                      overall effect is therefore very broad and ensures a
                      unique result on the animal.

                      Our Natural range comes in a variety of flavours and
                      contains ingredients for certain life stages.
                      Specially balanced diets for Weaning Puppies to
                      Senior Dogs and those with intolerances requiring a
                      more specialised diet.
                      Working Dog Food
                      Our Working Dog Range comes in a variety of
                      flavours, each one contains a slightly higher
                      percentage of protein and Vitamin C. All recipes in
                      this range include vegetables and fruit ensuring
                      they are nutritionally balanced and complete - no
                      added supplements needed.

                      A complementary food. Designed for those who like to
                      make their own recipes at home, this is pure British

                      tract by working with the good bacteria and the
                      animal's own immune system. Containing several types
                      of good and naturally-occurring bacteria, the
                      overall effect is therefore very broad and ensures a
                      unique result on the animal.
