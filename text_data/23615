Seasons Greetings from ARN

   Americas Rugby News December 25, 2015 Argentina, Canada, Others, USA 2
   Comments 223 Views

   It’s been a big year for rugby in the Americas and 2016 looks certain
   to be the biggest yet. The same can be said for Americas Rugby News.
   After initially discussing a post-World Cup start, we decided to push
   things well ahead of schedule and actually turned the lights on in
   June. It turned out to be a great decision, and between the big
   tournament in England, the unveiling of the Americas Rugby
   Championship, and the announcement of PRO Rugby, it’s fair to say we’ve
   been a bit busier than we anticipated!

   Thanks to the rapidly increasing interest in Americas rugby not only by
   people on these shores but around the world, we’ve been challenged to
   stay up to speed on all the issues and we thank you – our readers – for
   all the terrific feedback and your continued support. There’s no time
   to rest on our laurels, however, and over the next few days you’ll
   still see our regular coverage as well as a few year-end goodies,
   including our first annual ARN awards which will kick off on Monday
   through to the New Year.

   Speaking of 2016, look for a couple new initiatives as well as plenty
   more exclusives and analysis over the coming weeks as we rocket towards
   the new ARC, Super Rugby, and of course the Olympics.

   From all of us here at Americas Rugby News, have a safe and happy
   holidays.

Mélé chooses Leicester over Austin

   Americas Rugby News June 6, 2019 Canada, France, Spain, USA Leave a
   comment 1,711 Views

   Spain international David Mélé is no longer joining Austin Elite. The
   French halfback will instead return to Leicester Tigers, where he spent
   two seasons beginning in 2013, to become an academy coach. Mélé
   confirmed the decision on Spanish podcast El Tercer Tiempo.

   At 33 years old, Mélé was set to join Austin from Perpignan in a  a
   player-coach role while filling a gap at flyhalf. He has now decided to
   retire as a player following Spain’s three-match tour to South America
   that begins in Brazil this weekend.

   Austin struggled on and off the field this past season, finishing with
   an 0-16 record. This led to the recent appointment of Todd Clever as
   Director of Rugby with Thierry Daupin stepping down as General Manager.
   Further changes are expected with Alain Hyardet’s position as Head
   Coach under close scrutiny.
