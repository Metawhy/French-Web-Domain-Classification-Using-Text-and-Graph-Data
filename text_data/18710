WHO Global Action Plan

   The objective of the Global Action Plan is to enhance collaboration
   among 12 global organizations engaged in health, development and
   humanitarian responses to accelerate country progress on the
   health-related SDG targets.

Health-related SDGs

   With this tool, users can explore progress made toward achieving the
   United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Measure progress
   made by 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017.

The most beautiful chart in the world

   The decline in child mortality over the past two decades has been
   described as the greatest story in global public health.

The Goalkeepers Report 2019

   Goalkeepers is an annual report card on the world’s progress toward the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 17 ambitious goals the member
   states of the United Nations committed to reaching by 2030.

   Identifying residual hotspots and mapping lower respiratory infection
   morbidity and mortality in African children from 2000 to 2017

   Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) are the leading cause of death in
   children under the age of 5, despite the existence of vaccines against
   many of their aetiologies.

   Global, regional, and national cancer incidence, mortality, years of
   life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life
   years for 29 cancer groups, 1990 to 2017

   We used the GBD study estimation methods to describe cancer incidence,
   mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and
   disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Results are presented at the
   national level as well as by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite
   indicator of income, educational attainment, and total fertility
   rate.We also analyzed the influence of the epidemiological vs the
   demographic transition on cancer incidence.

   The global burden of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease: a
   systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017

   Non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease is a major cause of global
   morbidity and mortality. Malnourished children, those with recent
   malaria or sickle-cell anemia, and adults with HIV infection are at
   particularly high risk of disease. We sought to estimate the burden of
   disease attributable to non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease for
   the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD)
   2017.
