How do you find the cheap flights?

     * There could be cheap deals for flights at any time! A good tip is
       to search for flights on Tuesday, and to book flights that fly on
       Wednesday.
     * It’s usually better to buy your tickets 4-5 months in advance.
     * Last Minute Deals can also save you money. But you need a bit of
       luck as the price can vary due to the season and availability.
     * Flying there and back with different airlines or from different
       airports may help as well keeping the trip budget low. Use our
       filters during the search process and find the ticket that best
       suits your needs.
