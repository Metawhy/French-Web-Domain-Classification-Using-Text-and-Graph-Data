Andrew Yang challenges Sen. Ted Cruz in basketball, and Cruz tells him to
bring it

The Democratic candidate for president is in Houston, the senator's hometown,
for the debate Thursday night.

   Sen. Ted Cruz dribbled past Jimmy Kimmel during the Blobfish Basketball
   Classic and one-on-one interview at Texas Southern University's Health
   & Physical Education Arena in June 2018 in Houston. Cruz challenged
   Kimmel to the game after Kimmel blamed the Houston Rockets playoff loss
   on the senator. Cruz won 11-9.

   4:06 PM on Sep 12, 2019

   WASHINGTON — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic presidential candidate
   Andrew Yang are about to settle their partisan differences the old
   fashioned way: a one-on-one game of basketball.

   The idea for the game was born on Twitter when a Fox News producer
   replied to a video of Yang playing basketball, saying Cruz and Yang
   should play each other.

   Cruz quickly dismissed the idea.

   "Sorry. You gotta poll at 5% or more to play on my court," Cruz
   tweeted.

     Sorry. You gotta poll at 5% or more to play on my court.
     https://t.co/xRx6VYdWft
     — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 11, 2019

   Yang replied, pointing out that he was polling at exactly 5% in a
   recent poll by The Hill and Harris X, and telling Cruz he would be
   "delighted to beat you in basketball."

   Cruz tweeted a gif telling Yang to "bring it." They publicly hammered
   out the rules of engagement, settling on a one-on-one format in Houston
   sometime Friday afternoon. Yang, an entrepreneur and former technology
   executive, will be in Houston, Cruz's hometown, for the Democratic
   primary debate Thursday evening.

     Hmm. You’re taller than I am. From the video, you’re probably a
     better shot. And, I’ve seen you dunking (on an 8-foot rim).
     Altogether, pretty strong. So....... https://t.co/hVlhDfKS1W
     pic.twitter.com/cMepUnKWlu
     — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 12, 2019

   The loser will donate $5,000 to a nonpolitical charity of the winner's
   choice.

   Cruz confirmed Thursday morning that the game is on.

   "I think so. Right before I walked in, I accepted," Cruz told a group
   of reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.

   The Yang campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

   Cruz has played this game before. Last June, the senator challenged
   late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel to a game of one-on-one,
   defeating him 11-9. The News said the game could only be described
   as "some really bad basketball," with Cruz and Kimmel taking more than
   100 shots to get to that scoreline.

   Despite his win, Cruz appears to be positioning himself as the
   underdog, pointing out Yang's height advantage, superior shot form and
   ability to dunk on an 8-foot rim.

   "Look, the guy is, I'm pretty sure, taller than I am," Cruz said. "At
   least from online, it looks like he has a good shot. He's probably a
   better ball player than I am. It's part of why I suggested
   four-on-four. ... I think it would have been a better game and more
   fun. ... But I'm more than happy to do it."

Why this company is bringing dozens of French-built fighter jets to Fort
Worth Alliance Airport

Airborne Tactical Advantage Company broke ground last month on a new 75,000
square foot hangar that will eventually employ about 200 people.

   For 40 years, the Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jet saw action in combat
   zones in Africa and the Middle East as a staple of the French military.
   Now, more than 60 of the jets will find a home near Fort Worth where
   they’ll be taking on a new kind of mission as part of a
   multibillion-dollar opportunity for Alliance Airport’s newest tenant.

   Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., also known as ATAC, broke ground last
   month on a 75,000-square-foot hangar due to open next summer that will
   house maintenance and pilot-training functions. Mechanics there
   recently showed off two refurbished jets, the first of 63 F1s purchased
   from the French government that will eventually make up the fleet.

   ATAC, a part of Textron’s Airborne Solutions division, has a two-decade
   history providing adversary air services for the U.S. military,
   supplying outsourced jets and civilian pilots to play the role of enemy
   fighters in live training drills against Navy or Air Force pilots.

   The line of business is expected to grow dramatically in the coming
   years, with the Air Force in the early stages of bidding out a contract
   up to an estimated $7.5 billion over 10 years.

   “To challenge aircraft like the F-35 and the F-22, you need a lot of
   bad guys out there, because those things are lethal,” said ATAC chief
   executive Jeffrey Parker. The Air Force needs "more capability and they
   need more capacity. They can’t generate that internally any more.”

   Parker said outsourcing the role of training adversaries provides
   several advantages for the military. Older jets supplied by the likes
   of ATAC are cheaper to operate and save wear and tear on the U.S.
   military's expensive fleets. And, at a time when the Air Force is
   dealing with a pilot shortage, its and the Navy's pilots are freed up
   to focus on other duties.

   ATAC acquired the F1 jets to bulk up its existing fleet of nearly 30
   jets — made up of a mix of F-21 Kfir, MK-58 Hawker Hunter and L-39
   Albatros aircraft — to better compete for the upcoming Air Force
   contract. At its max, ATAC has provided about 6,000 flight-hours in a
   given year; the Air Force is looking for up to 37,000 a year.

   Several other companies will also be competing for the bid, including
   Draken International, which this summer won a $280 million contract to
   provide adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.

   At Alliance, a growing team of mechanics and support staff has been
   charged with getting the F1s up to speed. The effort includes
   assembling the aircraft after they arrive in several pieces,
   refurbishing the jets and retrofitting them with modern technologies
   like upgraded radars.

   ATAC said it expects to eventually employ about 200 people at the site,
   which will also serve as a parts depot for the fleet. The company did
   not disclose how much it is investing in its Alliance Airport facility.

   “The skilled labor in the aviation community around here is huge. It's
   better than anyplace else we're currently based,” said Parker.

   While the F1s will start out in Texas, they’ll spend much of their time
   being used in drills at military bases around the country, returning to
   Alliance Airport for maintenance and other work. ATAC expects to also
   add other types of jets to the Alliance base, bringing the total fleet
   up to as many as 80 jets in the coming years.

   “This base is geographically central. We can basically shoot jets east
   or west and get them there in a timely fashion, as well as get parts
   back and forth,” said Parker. "This will be the base that's farming the
   jets to other locations."

Andrew Yang challenges Sen. Ted Cruz in basketball, and Cruz tells him to
bring it

The Democratic candidate for president is in Houston, the senator's hometown,
for the debate Thursday night.

   Classic and one-on-one interview at Texas Southern University's Health
   & Physical Education Arena in June 2018 in Houston. Cruz challenged
   Kimmel to the game after Kimmel blamed the Houston Rockets playoff loss
   on the senator. Cruz won 11-9.

   By Paul Cobler

   4:06 PM on Sep 12, 2019

   WASHINGTON — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic presidential candidate
   Andrew Yang are about to settle their partisan differences the old
   fashioned way: a one-on-one game of basketball.

   The idea for the game was born on Twitter when a Fox News producer
   replied to a video of Yang playing basketball, saying Cruz and Yang
   should play each other.

   Cruz quickly dismissed the idea.

   "Sorry. You gotta poll at 5% or more to play on my court," Cruz
   tweeted.

     Sorry. You gotta poll at 5% or more to play on my court.
     https://t.co/xRx6VYdWft
     — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 11, 2019

   Yang replied, pointing out that he was polling at exactly 5% in a
   recent poll by The Hill and Harris X, and telling Cruz he would be
   "delighted to beat you in basketball."

   Cruz tweeted a gif telling Yang to "bring it." They publicly hammered
   out the rules of engagement, settling on a one-on-one format in Houston
   sometime Friday afternoon. Yang, an entrepreneur and former technology
   executive, will be in Houston, Cruz's hometown, for the Democratic
   primary debate Thursday evening.

     Hmm. You’re taller than I am. From the video, you’re probably a
     better shot. And, I’ve seen you dunking (on an 8-foot rim).
     Altogether, pretty strong. So....... https://t.co/hVlhDfKS1W

     — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 12, 2019

   The loser will donate $5,000 to a nonpolitical charity of the winner's
   choice.

   Cruz confirmed Thursday morning that the game is on.

{"unitName":"dfpPosition1","display":"mobile","isMobile":false}

   "I think so. Right before I walked in, I accepted," Cruz told a group
   of reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.

   The Yang campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

   Cruz has played this game before. Last June, the senator challenged
   late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel to a game of one-on-one,
   defeating him 11-9. The News said the game could only be described
   as "some really bad basketball," with Cruz and Kimmel taking more than
   100 shots to get to that scoreline.

   Despite his win, Cruz appears to be positioning himself as the
   underdog, pointing out Yang's height advantage, superior shot form and
   ability to dunk on an 8-foot rim.

   "Look, the guy is, I'm pretty sure, taller than I am," Cruz said. "At
   least from online, it looks like he has a good shot. He's probably a
   better ball player than I am. It's part of why I suggested
   four-on-four. ... I think it would have been a better game and more
   fun. ... But I'm more than happy to do it."

Why this company is bringing dozens of French-built fighter jets to Fort
Worth Alliance Airport

Airborne Tactical Advantage Company broke ground last month on a new 75,000
square foot hangar that will eventually employ about 200 people.

   12:30 PM on Nov 6, 2018

   For 40 years, the Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jet saw action in combat
   zones in Africa and the Middle East as a staple of the French military.
   Now, more than 60 of the jets will find a home near Fort Worth where
   they’ll be taking on a new kind of mission as part of a
   multibillion-dollar opportunity for Alliance Airport’s newest tenant.

   Airborne Tactical Advantage Co., also known as ATAC, broke ground last
   month on a 75,000-square-foot hangar due to open next summer that will
   house maintenance and pilot-training functions. Mechanics there
   recently showed off two refurbished jets, the first of 63 F1s purchased
   from the French government that will eventually make up the fleet.

   ATAC, a part of Textron’s Airborne Solutions division, has a two-decade
   history providing adversary air services for the U.S. military,
   supplying outsourced jets and civilian pilots to play the role of enemy
   fighters in live training drills against Navy or Air Force pilots.

   The line of business is expected to grow dramatically in the coming
   years, with the Air Force in the early stages of bidding out a contract
   up to an estimated $7.5 billion over 10 years.

   “To challenge aircraft like the F-35 and the F-22, you need a lot of
   bad guys out there, because those things are lethal,” said ATAC chief
   executive Jeffrey Parker. The Air Force needs "more capability and they
   need more capacity. They can’t generate that internally any more.”

   Parker said outsourcing the role of training adversaries provides
   several advantages for the military. Older jets supplied by the likes
   of ATAC are cheaper to operate and save wear and tear on the U.S.
   military's expensive fleets. And, at a time when the Air Force is
   dealing with a pilot shortage, its and the Navy's pilots are freed up
   to focus on other duties.

   ATAC acquired the F1 jets to bulk up its existing fleet of nearly 30
   jets — made up of a mix of F-21 Kfir, MK-58 Hawker Hunter and L-39
   Albatros aircraft — to better compete for the upcoming Air Force
   contract. At its max, ATAC has provided about 6,000 flight-hours in a
   given year; the Air Force is looking for up to 37,000 a year.

   Several other companies will also be competing for the bid, including
   Draken International, which this summer won a $280 million contract to
   provide adversary air services at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.

   At Alliance, a growing team of mechanics and support staff has been
   charged with getting the F1s up to speed. The effort includes
   assembling the aircraft after they arrive in several pieces,
   refurbishing the jets and retrofitting them with modern technologies
   like upgraded radars.

   ATAC said it expects to eventually employ about 200 people at the site,
   which will also serve as a parts depot for the fleet. The company did
   not disclose how much it is investing in its Alliance Airport facility.

   “The skilled labor in the aviation community around here is huge. It's
   better than anyplace else we're currently based,” said Parker.

   While the F1s will start out in Texas, they’ll spend much of their time
   being used in drills at military bases around the country, returning to
   Alliance Airport for maintenance and other work. ATAC expects to also
   add other types of jets to the Alliance base, bringing the total fleet
   up to as many as 80 jets in the coming years.

   “This base is geographically central. We can basically shoot jets east
   or west and get them there in a timely fashion, as well as get parts
   back and forth,” said Parker. "This will be the base that's farming the
   jets to other locations."
