   Plastic factories in the Gaza Strip seek to develop the local
   production of products through recycling, and break the reliance on
   imported goods.

   Palestinian laborers sort plastic containers before they are recycled
   in a factory in Abasan, southern Gaza Strip, Oct. 25, 2009.

   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — The Ramlawi Plastic Factory, located east of
   Gaza City, is making strides in the local plastics industry by
   recycling plastic and scrap for use in its products. This comes at a
   time when Gaza's plastics factories face numerous obstacles due to
   Israel’s ban on the entry of raw materials for plastics industries.

   “There is a growing trend in our factory and other factories to use
   plastic waste in the industry in light of the Israeli ban on raw
   materials into Gaza,” said Khalil Ramlawi, the director of the
   factory's marketing and quality department.

   Garbage containers and bins are seen as the best places to find plastic
   waste to be recycled in Gaza's factories, including at the Ramlawi
   factory, which was established in 1986. More young Palestinians have
   started to gather and then sell plastic materials to factories as a
   source of livelihood.

   The Gaza Strip produces about 1,900 tons of solid waste per day, 65% of
   which is organic waste, and the remaining 35% comprising plastic, paper
   and glass, according to a press statement from Gaza's Environmental
   Quality Authority.

   Amin Abu Sabih, 28, collects empty plastic bottles in the early morning
   hours from bins in Gaza and then sells them to factories.

   “Collecting plastic waste is a source of income for me and my family of
   four," he told Al-Monitor. "I sell 1 kilogram [2.2 pounds] of plastic
   for 2 shekels [$0.50]. I collect about 20 kilograms every day.”

   Collecting plastic waste is a source of livelihood for him and many
   others in light of rampant unemployment in the Gaza Strip. Furthermore,
   the collecting of plastic has helped reduce the instances of burning
   plastic as a form of waste disposal, thus mitigating the environmental
   damage caused by the practice.

   Palestine's unemployment rate stands at 26%, with the West Bank rate at
   18% and the Gaza Strip at 41.2%, according to July 2016 figures from
   the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.

   Ramlawi said that plastic waste must first go through a long process at
   the factory before being reproduced into new plastic products.

   “In our factory, we start with sorting plastic scrap to extract what
   can be recycled," he said. "The sorted products go through a
   preliminary grinding process and are reduced into small pieces the size
   of the palm of the hand. Then there is the washing phase with chemicals
   to rid the plastic of any defects. [The plastics are later] washed with
   water to clean them of chemicals. Later, the plastic scrap is melted
   inside a furnace at a temperature of 250 degrees Celsius [482 degrees
   Fahrenheit]. Finally, the plastic is turned into small beads to be used
   as raw materials.”

   Ramlawi's factory employs 55 workers and buys nearly 2 tons of plastic
   waste from collectors per day. Ramlawi said that all products
   manufactured from locally recycled plastic waste are not consumable
   goods but instead include trash bags, agricultural irrigation hoses and
   greenhouse bags.

   He pointed out that all the machines used in these operations are
   locally manufactured by engineers and are subject to dozens of
   experiments, since spare maintenance parts are not available for
   defective imported machines.

   Recycled plastic waste now makes up about 50% of his factory’s
   products. Ramlawi has found that locally manufactured plastic products
   are relatively cheaper than imported ones, thus prompting citizens to
   buy local, a boon for Gaza's deteriorating economy.

   Nevertheless, Ramlawi still faces hurdles and obstacles in developing
   the local recycling industry. The industry lacks support from the
   Palestinian government as well as from the European Union, which
   usually funds development projects in the Gaza Strip. Ramlawi further
   complained that the power outage crisis continuously disrupts work at
   the factory.

   Sami al-Nafar, the president of the Palestine Federation of Industries,
   said that 70 factories in the Gaza Strip specialize in plastic. These
   factories, he said, seek to increase reliance on recycled plastic waste
   to manufacture less expensive products.

   “Around 10% of plastic products in Gaza are manufactured using locally
   recycled plastic, while 90% of plastic products are imported as
   ready-to-use products from many countries, such as Israel and China,”
   he told Al-Monitor.

   He explained that there is a rising interest among local factories to
   increase the proportion of locally manufactured products.

   "Since August, the supply of raw materials into Gaza has been banned,"
   he said. "Although there is no declared Israeli decision in this
   respect, not all raw materials are allowed to enter Gaza. We have made
   several appeals to Israel to allow the entry of raw materials, but so
   far there has been no response.”

   Ramlawi called on local and international official bodies to provide
   the needed technical and financial aid to factories to support their
   recycling efforts and to help them overcome the Israeli blockade and
   produce plastic products of a higher quality.

   Despite the efforts by factory owners to use Gaza's recycled plastic in
   their products, the reproduced products are still of poor quality
   compared to imported plastic goods. As a result of the blockade,
   factory owners are unable to import new technologies to improve their
   rudimentary equipment and materials.

   Article Summary
   The Iranian president is in New York with a "peace initiative" meant to
   resolve regional tensions at a time when pressure is building on Tehran
   over its alleged involvement in attacks on Saudi oil facilities.

   REUTERS/John Irish
   French President Emmanuel Macron shakes hands with Iranian President
   Hassan Rouhani during their meeting on the sidelines of the United
   Nations General Assembly in New York, US, Sept. 23, 2019.

   A 90-minute meeting between President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and his
   French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, in New York covered a wide range
   of topics from bilateral ties to political solutions over the 2015 Iran
   nuclear deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
   (JCPOA).

   The discussions held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly,
   however, appeared to have been overshadowed by one thorny issue: Iran's
   alleged involvement in the Sept. 14 strikes on Saudi oil facilities
   claimed by Tehran-backed Yemeni Houthi rebels. Just ahead of the
   meeting, a joint statement from Britain, France and Germany pointed the
   finger of blame toward the Islamic Republic. "It is clear for us that
   Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible
   explanation," the statement read.

   Rouhani criticized the stance and told Macron the allegations were
   "baseless." Yet Iran has not shied away from backing the Houthis,
   justifying the drone strikes as the Yemenis' legitimate option in
   self-defense against the Saudi invasion of their country.

   According to Alireza Miryousefi, media bureau chief of the Iranian
   mission in New York, Rouhani also let his French counterpart hear about
   a peace initiative he is planning to present during an address to the
   General Assembly. The Hormuz Peace Initiative, named after the
   Iran-controlled strategic waterway, encourages contribution from the
   Persian Gulf littoral states for the long-term stability of the
   sensitive region.

   But Iran's rivals, most notably Saudi Arabia, backed by some Western
   states have relentlessly accused the Islamic Republic of malign and
   destabilizing conduct in the Persian Gulf. Against that backdrop, the
   statement by the three European signatories to the JCPOA also called on
   Tehran to come to the negotiating table for a "long-term framework"
   covering its regional activities and missile program.

   It did, unsurprisingly, draw a strongly worded condemnation from
   Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the man credited as being one of
   the key architects of the landmark accord. "E3's paralysis in
   fulfilling their obligations without US permission has been clear since
   May 2018," he tweeted, calling on the three countries to abandon
   "parroting absurd US claims."

   In recent weeks, France has been spearheading a diplomatic push that
   aims to save the nuclear deal and bring arch-enemies Iran and the
   United States closer together. But mixed signals from US President
   Donald Trump and Tehran's precondition that talks will be held only
   after Washington re-embraces the pact have sent a cloud of uncertainty
   over the success of the French initiative.

   Nevertheless, in an interview with CNN, Zarif did not rule out
   negotiations and tried to present a straightforward outline. He
   expressed Iran's willingness to immediately undertake the Additional
   Protocol, which the JCPOA does not enforce on Iran until 2023. Under
   the protocol, Iran will allow a closer oversight in the form of
   short-notice inspections of its nuclear facilities. But in exchange,
   according to Zarif's offer, Trump will need to lift all the sanctions
   he reinstated following his departure from the deal in May 2018. "We
   are prepared if President Trump is serious about permanent for
   permanent … Iran was never a nuclear weapons state, but permanent
   denuclearization, as they like to hear it," Zarif said.

   As Zarif was making those comments, harsh and loud warnings could be
   heard in the background from Iran's most uncompromising critics.
   "Either in the form of a phone conversation, a planned meeting or an
   accidental encounter, no talk whatsoever should take place," said Javad
   Karimi Ghoddousi, a senior hard-line lawmaker and member of the Iranian
   parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission. "If
   anything of the sort happens, Rouhani and Zarif had better know that
   they will pay a very big price."
