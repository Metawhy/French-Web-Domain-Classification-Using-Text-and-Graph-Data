The 14th International Semantic Web Conference

   October 11-15, 2015
     * Colonial Industrial Quarter
       Moravian colonists supported the original settlement of Bethlehem
       by producing goods in the Colonial Industrial Quarter, a 250-year
       old factory complex powered by water from the nearby Monocacy
       Creek. The settlement, founded in 1741, had indoor running water by
       1762. (Photo courtesy of Discover Lehigh Valley)
     * SteelStacks Park
       Crowds arrive for an outdoor concert at the Levitt Pavilion,
       SteelStacks. Under the gaze of the now-dormant blast furnace of the
       Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the site has been reborn as a
       performing arts complex. Many of the buildings and bridges in New
       York City were built from the steel made here. (Photo by Jeffrey
       Totaro)
     * ISWC is honored to host keynotes from both industry and research.
       Keynotes will be given by Michael Atkin (EDM Council, Inc.), Ian
       Horrocks (Oxford University), and Andrew McCallum (University of
       Massachusetts Amherst).
     * Sands Casino Resort
       Built on land formerly owned by Bethlehem Steel, the design of the
       Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem pays homage to the area's history.
       The Sands will be the conference hotel and the venue for the main
       conference. (Photo courtesy of Discover Lehigh Valley)
     * Lehigh's University Center
       Lehigh’s University Center stands on the side of South Mountain.
       Founded in 1865, Lehigh University will be celebrating its
       Sesquicentennial anniversary while ISWC is in town.
     * 22 workshops and 8 tutorials will be held from October 11–12. For
       the first time at ISWC, there will not only be research-oriented
       workshops, but also a developer workshop and a workshop on
       education.
     * ISWC 2015 features an updated design of research and industry
       tracks: Research, Empirical Studies and Experiments, In-Use and
       Software, Data Sets and Ontologies as well as Industry. 87 papers
       have been accepted for there tracks. In addition, 99 posters and
       demos will be presented.
