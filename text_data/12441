    3. Set your filters using the filter tool.*IMPORTANT* – If you are NOT
       using our double opt-in feature, you MUST use the “User Properties”
       section to make sure you are only including subscribed users, as
       shown below. If you are not sure if you’re using double opt-in,
       contact support@boomtrain.com.

    4. Compose your message – we recommend using our A/B testing feature
       to maximize your results!
    5. Edit your delivery settings to set how frequently a user may
       qualify for this specific message. We recommend only once every 30
       days, so you’re not bombarding your shoppers with too many emails.
       Once that’s complete, you can activate your message, and you’re
       finished.

[Whitepaper] 2019 WP Measurement & Attribution – Exploring a More
Deterministic Approach

   By Nicholas Einstein and David Daniels, The Relevancy Group
   Research Sponsored by Zeta Global

   Email is currently contributing upwards of twenty percent of overall
   revenue for mean respondents, signaling increased weight of the channel
   and highlighting the need for more accurate measurement and
   attribution. For a variety of key reasons, email open and click through
   metrics are on a three year upward trend.

   Key Questions:
   • What is the current contribution of the email channel to overall
   revenue?
   • Are engagement metrics trending up or down?
   • What are the top priorities for marketers in 2019?

Events Needed:

     * search
     * update_cart (optional, used for exclusions)
     * purchase (optional, used for exclusions)

Data Needed:

     * lastPurchase (optional, for exclusions – additional user property
       of type last_occurrence)

    1. If you are using lastPurchase date as an exclusion, you’ll need to
       create that user property. Navigate to Users > User Properties >
       Your Properties, and select “Add Property”.
       image02 image01
    2. Create a property called “lastPurchase”, of type “last_occurrence”,
       with activity name “purchase”. This property will always capture
       the date and time of the most recent purchase for every customer.
       image03
    3. Create a segment to capture your exclusions. Navigate back to All
       Users, and use the filter tool to create your audience, as shown.
       You will want to filter out:
          + (optional) all users who have made purchases recently – we
            recommend 14 days as a starting point.
          + (optional) all users who have items in their shopping cart
            (since those users should be getting an abandoned shopping
            cart email). image05
    4. Save your segment and be sure to check the “keep this segment
       updated” box to ensure your segment is always up to date.
       image11
    5. Navigate to Activities > Behaviors and create a new behavior, like
       below. In the “within” box, enter how long you want to wait for the
       user to come back to your site before you send your abandon email.
       We recommend 3 hours for a first follow-up. Name and save your
       behavior.
       image15
    6. Create a triggered email, give it a name, and select your new
       behavior as the trigger.
       image06
    7. Set your filters using the filter tool. Add your exclusion segment
       that you created to the “Not Included in segment(s)” box, as shown
       below.*IMPORTANT* – If you are NOT using our double opt-in feature,
       you MUST use the “User Properties” section to make sure you are
       only including subscribed users, as shown below. If you are not
       sure if you’re using double opt-in, contact support@boomtrain.com.
       image09
    8. Compose your message – we recommend using our A/B testing feature
       to maximize your results!
    9. Edit your delivery settings to set how frequently a user may
       qualify for this specific message. We recommend only once every
       30-90 days, so you’re not bombarding your shoppers with too many
       emails. Once that’s complete, you can activate your message, and
       you’re finished.

    2. PLATFORM AND ANALYTICS PRIVACY POLICY
    3. DSP PRIVACY POLICY

   Last Updated August 02, 2019 to add Zeta DSP Privacy Policy

1. Website Privacy Policy

   Scope

   This Zeta Website Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies solely
   to information collected by Zeta Interactive Corp. (“Zeta”) on this
   Zeta website (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy provides information
   about how and why Zeta collects and uses the information provided to us
   on this Site.

   For information on Zeta’s Platform and Analytics Services and how to
   opt-out please refer to the Zeta Platform Privacy Policy located below.

   For information on the Zeta DSP and how to opt out of having data
   processed by Zeta DSP, see the Zeta DSP Privacy Policy located below.

   Links to Third Party Sites

   This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information collection and
   use practices of third party sites including, but not limited to,
   client and affiliate websites, applications and websites on which we
   may place advertisements, and any third party websites you may link to
   from our sites. Zeta does not endorse or make any representations about
   these third party sites or applications, or any information, software,
   products or materials found there. We encourage you to review the
   privacy policies of these third party sites to understand their data
   collection and use practices.

   Information Collection, Use and Sharing

   Information Collection

   We collect two types of information from and about our Site Users:
   personal information (or “personal data” in the EEA) which is collected
   when you provide it do us, and tracking data which is collected when
   you navigate the website.

   Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable
   Information is information that identifies a specific individual, such
   as first and last name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone
   number and date of birth.

   Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable
   Information is information that does not identify a specific
   individual. This type of information may include things like the
   Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the Site you visited before coming
   to our Site, the URL of the Site you visit after leaving our Site, the
   type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”)
   address. We, and/or our authorized third parties, may automatically
   collect this information when you visit our Site through the use of
   electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as
   described below.

   We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot,
   administer the Site, analyze trends, gather demographic information,
   comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement
   activities. We may also share this information with our authorized
   third parties to measure the overall effectiveness of our online
   advertising, content, and programming.

   Personal Data. Personal Data means any information about an individual
   from which that person can be identified. It does not include data
   where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). Certain types of
   Non-Personally Identifiable Information is considered personal data in
   the EEA. If we collect such information from persons residing in the
   EEA, we treat it as Personal Data.

   Information Use

   Zeta uses the information we collect to fulfill your requests, respond
   to your inquiries and provide Zeta news or updates. We may also use
   your information to make our Sites easier for you to use and to inform
   you of service and product updates, whitepapers, new products, market
   research opportunities and other related information from Zeta.

   Zeta may use your browser information to analyze trends, administer the
   Site, track users’ activities on the Site, help us understand the parts
   of our Sites visited most often and gather broad demographic
   information for aggregate use in improving our Site.

   Zeta may use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you
   promotional messages regarding various Zeta products and services.

   Zeta may also obtain personally identifiable information from you
   regarding any job postings you may apply to, such as name, email
   address, mailing address, employment history and any other personally
   identifiable information contained in your resume/C.V. that you submit
   through our Sites. We may use your personally identifiable information
   to send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password for
   employee recruitment purposes and to respond to your requests for
   information and correspond with you throughout the application process.
   To view our EEA specific Employee Recruitment Policy please click here.

   Information Sharing and Disclosure

   Zeta may share your personally identifiable information with our
   affiliate companies and service providers who may be able to address or
   respond to your inquiries and maintain or improve the functionality of
   our Site.

   We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable
   information as required by law, court order or other valid legal
   processes or in connection with the consolidation, sale of or other
   transaction related to our business. We also reserve the right to
   disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe in
   good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect
   your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
   government request.

   Choices

   Opt-Out of Zeta Corporate Communications

   You may opt-out from receiving Zeta Corporate Communications by

   disputes, enforce our agreements and to maintain a record of your
   opt-out. You may also still receive transactional emails, such as
   registration confirmation, product updates and responses to direct
   requests you have made.

   INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS.

   For users based in the European Economic Area (EEA) we may share your
   personal data within the Zeta Group or with external third parties.
   This may involve transferring your data outside the EEA.

   Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
   similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one
   of the following safeguards is implemented:
     * We may transfer your personal data to countries that have been
       deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data
       by the European Commission. For further details, see European
       Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU
       countries.
     * We may transfer data subject to specific contracts approved by the
       European Commission, which ensures that personal data the same
       protection it has in Europe regardless of where it is processed.
       For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for
       the transfer of personal data to third countries.
     * For some service providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
       them if they participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield program, which
       requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
       between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European
       Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.

   Please contact us if you want further information on the specific
   mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the
   EEA.

   Do Not Track

   Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
   Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a
   technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’
   visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting.
   Zeta does not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals
   with respect to the Company’s Web sites, in part, because no common
   industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups,
   technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of
   interpreting user intent.

   Children’s Privacy

   This Site and the services we provide are intended for general
   audiences, and is not intended for use by persons under the age of 13.
   If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personally
   identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will
   delete it. If you believe that we have collected personally
   identifiable information from a child under 13, please contact us using
   the information below.

   Updates to this Privacy Policy

   We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so
   please review it frequently. Note the date of the most recent update at
   the top of this page. If we make material changes to this policy, we
   will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on our home page.

3. ZETA DSP PRIVACY POLICY

   Last Modified 1 August, 2019

   This portion of the Zeta Global Privacy Policy applies exclusively to
   the operations of the Zeta Data Management Platform and Zeta Demand
   Side Platform, collectively the “Zeta DSP.”

   Zeta DSP was acquired in May, 2019 by Zeta Global Corp. as assets
   purchased from Sizmek, which in turn had created the DSP by combining
   companies it had previously acquired: Rocket Fuel and [X+1]. The terms
   of this DSP Privacy Policy therefore address data that may have been
   originally collected by Zeta DSP or any of those earlier companies

   This DSP Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding collection,
   use, and sharing of data through our digital advertising services and
   instructions for opting out of our use of data that relates to you for
   interest-based advertising.

Understanding this Privacy Policy

   The infrastructure of online advertising is technologically complex. We
   want to be as transparent as we can be by explaining the range of
   things we do with data. We also don’t want to overwhelm you with
   technical details, and think it is important for our privacy policy to
   be understandable. We’ve given it our best shot. If after reading this
   privacy policy you still have questions, you may contact
   privacy@zetaglobal.com for more information.

   How this Privacy Policy Relates to the Zeta Global Privacy Policy; Data
   Collected Under NAI Rules Remains Subject to NAI Rules.
   This DSP privacy policy applies only to the activities of Zeta DSP, and
   not to other Zeta services. Prior to Zeta acquiring the Zeta DSP, its
   data assets belonged to Sizmek, which was a member of the Network
   Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). Zeta is not a member of the NAI
   program, but we will continue to fulfill the promises that were made
   under the NAI program with respect to data acquired by Zeta from
   Sizmek, and which is collected by Zeta DSP through September 30, 2019.

   Specifically, Zeta DSP data does not include directly identifiable data
   such as a name, address, or email address. Under NAI rules this data
   cannot be combined or matched with fully identifiable data without
   consent from the individuals to whom such data relates. Zeta Global,
   the parent company of Zeta DSP, does collect and use fully identifiable
   data, as described in the Zeta Global privacy policy above. We have
   therefore implemented technical and administrative measures to keep
   Zeta DSP data that is subject to the NAI Code logically separate from
   the Zeta Data Cloud and to ensure the data subject to the NAI Code is
   not combined with directly identifiable data without consent. This
   prohibition will remain in effect permanently for data acquired as part
   of the acquisition of Zeta DSP and for data collected by the DSP
   through September 30, 2019. As of October 1, 2019, this prohibition
   will no longer be in effect and Zeta DSP may match its data to fully
   identifiable data held by Zeta Global, in accordance with applicable
   laws.

Zeta DSP Advertising Services

Our Consumer Mission

   At Zeta DSP, we want digital advertising to be a useful complement to
   your online experience. We want to deliver personalized, well-chosen
   ads to help you discover things that interest you—new websites, new
   products, new bargains. Our advertising business also helps fund the
   free content and services you enjoy across the Internet.

   We use complex technology to pick the best ads to show, based on
   everything we know about the context: the ad itself, the page that
   needs an ad, the time of day and other external factors, and
   information from your browser or mobile device digital advertising
   identifier that we use to predict what advertising would be most
   relevant and interesting to you.

   If we can make ads more useful and interesting for you, then we’ll also
   make advertising more valuable to advertisers, and your visits will
   make websites more money per ad, and power their investments in the
   websites, apps, online features and content that they provide to you
   for free. Fueling ad supported free content and services is an endeavor
   that we are proud to be a part of, and we hope you’re equally happy
   with the results. But if you’re not, you may learn more about opting
   out of our use of your data for personalized advertisements in the
   section below under “Opting Out of Personalized Advertisements.”

How We Think of You

   Before describing the kinds of data we collect, it’s important to
   understand how we think of you and other web surfers and online
   consumers. Zeta DSP does not know you personally, and we do not need to
   in order to provide you with relevant advertising. We place an
   identifier within a cookie on your web browser or use an advertising ID
   generated by your mobile device. So to us you, and anyone else that
   uses that browser or mobile device, are just “surfer82” for example.
   Our cookies are called “rfihub” or “ru4” and you can find them if you
   search for cookies in your browser settings.

   We don’t request or store information that can be used to identify you
   directly, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address.
   We also prohibit our affiliates, partners and customers from sharing
   this information with us

   So, when we talk about “you” in this privacy policy, we are referring
   to information that we have associated with one or more identifiers
   associated with a web browser (such as Google Chrome or Firefox) that
   you might use, or with an advertising ID associated with your mobile
   device.

Information We Collect

   We collect several types of information from and about you, as
   described in this section. Not all of the types of data collection
   described below necessarily apply to you—it depends on your browser and
   device settings and which online services or content you access.

   When you visit one of our advertiser’s websites or mobile applications
   (“apps”), or the websites or apps where we display advertisements, we
   collect information about your activity on that site (such as the page
   viewed or the advertising that you clicked on) or the location of your
   device, in order to show you relevant advertising (e.g., for local
   events), control how many times you may see the same advertisement, in
   addition to providing advertisers aggregate metrics that help them pay
   publishers for displaying this advertising

   We collect information about your device, such as unique device
   identifier, browser type and language, and about your connectivity,
   such as the IP address, the server your computer is logged into, and
   the operating system information.

   We collect information about our interactions with you, such as which
   ads we’ve shown, and on which pages, and whether you responded to those
   ads by interacting with them.

   To learn about the ads you might like or dislike, we may also ask you
   questions directly—for example, we may provide a survey that asks about
   which ads, products, or brands you like or dislike.

   We collect information about our partners’ interactions with you—for
   example, by placing pixels on an advertiser’s web page that let us know
   if you ultimately purchased an item after we ran an advertising
   campaign that showed you an ad. We obtain data from other companies
   that also use cookie or device identifiers to share similar information
   that they have collected about you with us. For example, we may partner
   with other companies to learn the kinds of products you like to buy
   online

   We store all this information in a profile in our database.

   About Health Data. We do not use data about you from your health care
   providers or insurers unless you have consented for them to use your
   data to advertise to you. We may infer certain non-sensitive health
   related interests from the sites you visit and the ads you interact
   with. We do not use data relating to cancer, mental illness,
   sexually-transmitted diseases, or children’s diseases (other than
   over-the-counter ailments) to select or deliver advertising unless our
   client has obtained your consent for the use of that data. (Click here
   for a list of our standard health segments.)

   About Political Data. We do not have information about how you voted.
   We infer political interests from the sites your browser or device
   visits and the ads you interact with, and we can combine this with
   general geo-location data obtained from your IP address to determine,
   for instance, that you are a likely voter for a particular party in a
   specific congressional district. (Click here for a list of our
   political segments.)

Data Retention and Security

   Zeta DSP deletes user profiles in our database after 90 days of
   inactivity. This means that if we have not had an opportunity to show a
   consumer an ad, observed a visit from a consumer to a website that
   includes a Zeta DSP pixel, or received new information from one of our
   partners about a consumer, we will delete the user ID associated with
   that consumer. We see activity from a broad range of different places
   on the Internet, and the 90-day period restarts every time we have an
   interaction with you. So as a practical matter, if you want to opt out
   of our cookie and device-based data collection, you should follow the
   steps to opt out described below.

   Data that we compile for purposes like reporting, attribution and fraud
   detection will be retained for up to 30 months.

   We use physical, administrative, and industry standard technical
   safeguards that are designed to protect the information that we collect
   and maintain.

How We Use Information

   We use the information that we collect directly or receive from other
   companies to find patterns that help us select better ads to serve you
   at any given moment. For example, we might learn that an ad for mp3
   downloads is attractive to people who’ve previously clicked ads for mp3
   players, or we might learn that a coffee ad works better in the
   morning. Our technology can test millions of possibilities along these
   lines and build models using huge amounts of data to predict responses
   to advertising.

   Zeta DSP matches information relating to devices and browsers with
   other companies through a process called “cookie matching.” The “cookie
   matching” process synchronizes two IDs belonging to different companies
   in a way that makes it easier to serve advertising online, without the
   need to share other pieces of information about the ID. In other words,
   this process enables two or more companies can take coordinated action
   with respect to your device or browser without needing to share with
   each other what each respectively knows about you.

   We make inferences from the data we assemble from these different
   sources in order to show you advertisements for products or services
   that we think may interest you. We sort your device/browser into
   interest or purchase intent “segments” such as “Footwear > Sports &
   Fitness > Indoor Fitness”

   We also use the information we collect to measure effectiveness of ads
   on behalf of our advertisers and publishers.

   We may also predict whether different identifiers associated with
   different browsers and different devices, like a laptop, a phone or a
   tablet, may belong to one person or household, and then link the
   activity we see across those devices into a common profile. We call
   this a “cross device graph.” We believe this helps us serve you better
   advertisements, control how many times you may see the same ad, and
   provide better service to our advertisers. We make these predictions
   based on the device and cookie identifiers and associated interest and
   intent information that we receive from our third-party partners, as
   described above. However, again, we do not collect, use or store
   directly identifiable information (for example, your account
   information with a service provider) when we create these cross-device
   graphs.

Information Sharing

   We produce reports and analytics for our clients regarding the
   performance of their advertising campaigns and regarding the
   characteristics of people that were responsive to the ads, but we do
   not share the online profiles of individuals that our technology
   generates for commercial purposes.

   On the other hand, we may share any information we hold when we believe
   that we are required to do so by law (including legal processes like
   subpoenas, warrants or court orders), or as we believe necessary to
   protect the health, safety, or legal rights of any person.

   Finally, we may transfer information to a successor or assignee in
   connection with a corporate change in control such as a merger or
   acquisition or other transaction.

Opting Out of Personalized Advertisements

   You can click here to opt out of interest based advertising from Zeta
   DSP. If you opt out of interest-based advertising from Zeta DSP, then
   we will opt you out for all the identifiers or devices that we have
   associated with you at the time of the opt out request. We use a
   predictive process to associate identifiers and devices and do not know
   definitively all devices or browsers that you may use, so that process
   is not guaranteed to be error free. If you want to be completely
   thorough we recommend that you use this opt out process for each device
   and browser you use.

   Zeta DSP is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), so
   you may also opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from Zeta
   DSP or other NAI member companies via the NAI opt-out page here.

   Zeta DSP also complies with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online
   Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance
   (DAA) and European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA). You may opt out
   of receiving personalized advertisements by DAA members via the DAA
   website here and EDAA members here.

   Zeta DSP is integrated with the DAA’s AppChoices, which allows
   consumers to download and manage their privacy preferences in a mobile
   environment. You may download DAA’s AppChoices mobile app on your iOS
   or Android device in order to exercise choice regarding the collection
   of application activity for interest-based advertising. Links to those
   applications are below:
   • DAA AppChoices iOS
   • DAA AppChoices Android
   • Ad Privacy Manager iOS
   • Ad Privacy Manager Android

What happens when I opt out?

   An opt-out in any of the tools listed here will have the same effect,
   and you do not need to make an opt out selection using more than one
   method (we have to list them all as a condition of being members of
   these groups). If you opt out of interest-based advertising, you’ll
   still see ads from us online, but they may not be tailored to your
   interests. Note that we’ll still maintain a cookie on your computer to
   note the fact that you’ve opted out. That opt-out cookie is associated
   with a particular computer and browser. So, for example, if you get a
   new computer, install a new browser, or clear your cookies, you’ll need
   to opt-out again if you still do not want interest-based advertising.
   Our opt-out cookies never expire. If you change your mind, click here
   to opt back in.

Industry Memberships

   self-regulatory programs:
     * the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral

     * Zeta DSP is licensed and certified to deploy the Advertising Option

Our Policy Regarding Children

   Zeta DSP does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone
   under 13 years of age. Our services are directed to businesses —
   advertisers and their agencies — and are not directed to children under
   13. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child
   under 13 without parental consent, we will delete such information. If
   you believe that we might have any information from a child younger
   than 13, please contact us as set forth below.

Personal Data Relating to European Union Residents

   Zeta DSP utilizes the EU’s Standard Contractual Clauses as its basis
   for transferring EU data to the United States for processing.

   Under certain circumstances, Zeta DSP may be required to disclose
   personal information in response to valid requests by public
   authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement
   requirements.

   Zeta DSP maintains reasonable and appropriate security measures to
   protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access,
   disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We use physical,
   administrative, and industry standard technical safeguards that are
   designed to protect the information that we collect and maintain.

   You have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain
   personal information relating to you. Upon request, we will provide you
   with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may
   also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold
   about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct,
   amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his query to the
   contact information provided below. If requested to remove data, we
   will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

   Your right to access your personal information may be restricted in
   exceptional circumstances, including, but not limited to, when the
   burden or expense of providing this access would be disproportionate to
   the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or when the rights
   of persons other than you would be violated by the provision of such
   access. If we determine that your access should be restricted in a
   particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of our
   determination and respond to any inquiries you may have.

   If you opt out, you’ll still see ads from us online, and we’ll still do
   our best to serve the most relevant ads we can, but we will know less
   about your interests and purchase behavior. Note that we’ll still
   maintain two cookies on your computer to track that you’ve opted
   out—two because we have two domains from which we serve cookies. These
   opt-out cookies (like all cookies) are associated with a particular
   computer and browser. So, for example, if you get a new computer,
   install a new browser, or clear your cookies, you’ll need to opt-out
