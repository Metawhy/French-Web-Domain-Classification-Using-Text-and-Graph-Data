Dawn

   MORE

ON THIS PAGE

   Dawn launched in 2007 on a journey that put about 4.3 billion miles
   (6.9 billion kilometers) on its odometer. Propelled by ion engines, the
   spacecraft achieved many firsts until its extended mission concluded on
   Nov. 1, 2018.

The Latest

     * Scientists Solve Mystery of Ceres' Lonely Mountain

   In 2011, when Dawn arrived at Vesta, the second largest world in the
   main asteroid belt, the spacecraft became the first to orbit a body in
   the region between Mars and Jupiter.

   In 2015, when Dawn went into orbit around Ceres, a dwarf planet that is
   also the largest world in the asteroid belt, the mission became the
   first to visit a dwarf planet and go into orbit around two destinations
   beyond Earth.

   Among its accomplishments, Dawn showed how important location was to
   the way objects in the early solar system formed and evolved. Dawn also
   reinforced the idea that dwarf planets could have hosted oceans over a
   significant part of their history – and potentially still do. The data
   Dawn beamed back to Earth from its four science experiments enabled
   scientists to compare two planet-like worlds that evolved very
   differently.

   Key Mission Findings

Key Mission Findings

   Dawn orbited Vesta for more than a year, from July 2011 to September
   2012. Its investigation confirmed that Vesta is the parent of the HED
   (howardites, eucrites, and diogenites) meteorites, which Dawn connected
   to Vesta’s large south polar basin, a priceless cosmic connection
   between samples in hand and a singular event on a small planet.

   this young crater in the Rheasilvia impact basin likely comes from deep
   inside Vesta. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA | › Full Image
   and Caption

   Vesta is small enough (about the same size as Saturn's moon Enceladus)
   to have been deeply scarred by the Rheasilvia impact that launched the
   HEDs, but large enough to have differentiated into an iron core,
   silicate mantle, and igneous crust. Dawn also found hydrated and carbon
   rich material on its surface supplied by impactors, a result that was
   unexpected based on pre-Dawn telescopic observations.

   After its escape from Vesta and its journey onward, Dawn entered orbit
   around Ceres in March 2015. Dawn discovered that the inner solar
   system’s only dwarf planet was an ocean world where water and ammonia
   reacted with silicate rocks. As the ocean froze, salts and other
   telltale minerals concentrated into deposits that are now exposed in
   many locations across the surface. Dawn also found organics in several
   locations on Ceres’ surface.

Ashley Davies

Volcanologist

NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Where are you from?

   I'm from London, England.

What first sparked your interest in space?

   When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon and Neil Armstrong took his giant
   leap for mankind, it was early in the morning in the U.K. To this day,
   I clearly remember my mother coming into the bedroom and asking if
   anyone was awake and I spoke up. It was just after 3 a.m., July 21,
   1969. The next thing I knew, I was bundled up on the living room sofa
   with my mother, watching this astonishing event unfold on our black and
   white TV.

   Rugby

How did you end up working in the space program?

   I got interested in planetary science, volcanoes in particular, when I
   was in high school in England. Two events took place that had a great
   effect on me. At the time, I had no idea how these would shape my life
   and lead me to where I am today. The first thing that fired my
   imagination regarding planetary science was in 1979, when the NASA
   Voyager spacecraft discovered active volcanoes on Io, one of the moons
   of Jupiter. I knew about Io, I'd seen it through my telescope, but the
   fact that it had active, erupting volcanoes was wonderful to me—the
   conventional wisdom of the time said all of these outer solar system
   moons were inert, dead ice balls.

   The second interesting event was the following year, when Mount St.
   Helens erupted—and showed how even the mainland United States was
   vulnerable to volcanic eruptions. My love of astronomy has stayed with
   me all my life, and kept me focused on my studies through high school.
   I worked hard as an undergraduate, and focused more on geology, which
   was new to me, but which I found fascinating. My final year project
   examined volcanoes on Earth and Mars. I moved on to a Ph.D. at
   Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, where I studied volcanoes
   on Io and how they might erupt. I was lucky to be mentored by
   Professors Lionel Wilson and Harry Pinkerton. Lionel, especially was
   (and still is) at the forefront of mathematical volcanology, uncovering
   the secrets of volcanic eruptions through an understanding of the
   underlying physics. I finally ended up at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
   (JPL) in 1994 as a post-doctoral associate, studying Io's volcanoes,
   and then I was on the Galileo science team. I'm still at it, studying
   the extraordinary volcanoes on Io and also those on Earth. I now
   consider myself to be an Io expert—I have even written the definitive
   book on Io's volcanoes.

   The first thing that fired my imagination regarding planetary science
   was in 1979, when the NASA Voyager spacecraft discovered active
   volcanoes on Io.

     - Ashley Davies

What is a volcanologist?

   I study volcanoes—how they erupt, and why—and what they tell us about
   the interior not only of the Earth, but other planets and satellites
   across the solar system. Volcanoes have had a tremendous effect on the
   evolution of all the solid planets and many of the moons in the solar
   system. Volcanoes are windows into the interior of a planet—we see what
   the interior is made of because volcanoes erupt this stuff onto the
   surface where spacecraft can see it. Studying them here on Earth helps
   us understand how they work out there.

   Erta Ale Ethiopia
   Visiting Erta'Ale in Ethiopia in 2009.

What was it like the first time you witnessed a volcano erupt?

   The first volcano I saw actually in eruption was Kilauea volcano,
   Hawai’i. I was with my Ph.D. advisor (Prof. Lionel Wilson) and he hired
   a light plane for an overflight of the volcano. This was in 1988. When
   the pilot found out we were volcanologists he gave us a grand tour,
   standing the plane almost on its wingtip as we circled low over the
   Kupaianaha lava lake. The lake was very active, and it was a
   spectacular sight. I was well and truly hooked.

Do you have a favorite volcano?

   On Earth, it's probably a toss-up between Erebus in Antarctica and
   Erta’Ale in Ethiopia. Both volcanoes have an active lava lake at their
   summits. The Erta’Ale lava lake in particular is likely a great
   analogue for some volcanic features on Io. It is also a perfectly
   mesmerizing sight, as the lava roils away under a thin crust, and
   occasionally lava fountains form, which are quite a sight (especially
   at night). I have a fond memory of sitting on the edge of the crater
   late one evening, watching the lake perform and just enjoying the
   spectacle.

What have been some favorite moments in your career so far?

   In 2009 I traveled to the hottest place on Earth, the Afar region of
   Ethiopia. In August the temperature was over 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50
   degrees Celsius). And in the Afar is the volcano Erta'Ale. This volcano
   has a very rare volcanic feature, an active lava lake, which in 2009
   was about 55 m in diameter. This is a churning, spitting, cauldron of
   molten rock. I was amazed to hear the whooshing as the lava lake
   churned away, to smell and taste the acrid gases escaping from the
   lava, and to feel the blast of heat from the molten rock. I was there
   filming a sequence about Io for a television series called "Wonders of
   the Solar System," created by the British Broadcasting Corporation
   (BBC), and it was an amazing experience standing above this
   extraordinary lava lake discussing volcanoes on Io. The lava lake
   somehow reminded me of a tiger: beautiful to look at, a creature of
   immense power that was barely restrained, but if you got too close or
   were unlucky—well, it could take your arm off.

   A few years ago I went to Antarctica to another lava lake at the summit
   of Mount Erebus, the world's most southerly erupting volcano. There the
   temperature was typically -58 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 degrees Celsius).
   So my job has taken me to the absolute extreme places on Earth, as well
   as to Io (via spacecraft, at least!)

How do you overcome challenges?

   Never, never, never surrender to circumstance. You come up with a Plan
   B, and if that doesn’t work, then a Plan C. Exhaust the alphabet, if
   necessary.

What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path
as you?

   A foundation in physics and mathematics is a great help. From an early
   age I was interested in astronomy. The process never ends—I'm still
   learning. Simply put, a lot of my job concerns heat. I think about how
   heat is lost from an object to its surroundings, and how heat loss
   affects the body losing heat. The object in question could be a planet,
   or a moon, or an individual lava flow or lake. A lot of the job is
   identifying the processes taking place and using physics to understand
   them under conditions on different planets. To do my job you really
   need a Ph.D. It is a lot of work, but it is immensely rewarding.

   Hiking to Mt. Everest base camp in 1990.

What do you do for fun?

   It sounds trite, but my work is really fun. I enjoy it so much that it
   is difficult to separate it from out of work activities as I am
   constantly thinking about what to do next with volcanoes. My very
   understanding wife cuts me a lot of slack! But I read
   voraciously—military history, thrillers, mysteries, science fiction and
   books on the history of science. I adore movies, and think that "The
   Big Bang Theory" is not only the funniest thing on TV but reminds me of
   some of the people I work with—really.

What are some of your favorite science fiction books and authors?

   I read science fiction voraciously. Growing up I read a lot of Arthur
   C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov. One of my favorite Clark novels is “The
   Fountains of Paradise”, and I love his many short stories. Try the
   collection published in “Tales from the White Hart”. Asimov came up
   with “I, Robot” and others, terrific stories exploring the morality and
   ethics of early A.I. Another favourite: Robert Heinlein’s “The Moon is
   a Harsh Mistress”. In recent years I have hugely enjoyed the work of
   David Brin, Kim Stanley Robinson (his trilogy of martian novels “Red
   Mars”, “Green Mars” and “Blue Mars” is just fascinating; and “2312”;
   and “Aurora”) and the novels of Neal Stephenson – including
   “Seveneves,” which has the most gripping opening line of any novel I
   have ever read.

If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or
engineering, what advice would you give them?

   We are living in a new golden age of planetary exploration—there are
   spacecraft exploring the solar system from one end to the other, and
   now JPL is engaged in planning the next big mission to the Jupiter
   system. It won't arrive for many years, and a lot of scientists and
   engineers will be needed—to work on communications, propulsion,
   instrument design, project management, spacecraft design, scientists to
   establish the science goals of the mission, the observations that need
   to be made to meet those goals, the instruments needed to make the
   observations, and finally to analyze the data collected. So to get to
   JPL, work hard in school. Find a subject that you enjoy and stick with
   it. When you hit a rough patch (yes, I certainly hit a few), remember

Galileo Sees Io Erupt

   volcanic plume visible over the limb of the moon Io
   Source: NASA/JPL/DLR
   Published: August 28, 2018
   Historical Date: June 28, 1997

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft caught Jupiter's moon Io, the planet’s
   third-largest moon, undergoing a volcanic eruption.

   Locked in a perpetual tug of war between the imposing gravity of
   Jupiter and the smaller, consistent pulls of its neighboring moons,
   Io’s distorted orbit causes it to flex as it swoops around the gas
   giant. The stretching causes friction and intense heat in Io’s
   interior, sparking massive eruptions across its surface.

   Four spacecraft (Pioneer 10 & 11, then Voyager 1 & 2) had previously
   flown by the Jupiter system, but the Galileo mission was the first to
   enter orbit around the planet. Like the famed astronomer for which it
   was named, Galileo would study the King of Planets over an extended
   period, in finer detail than was ever possible before.

   To accomplish this, the Galileo orbiter carried 10 science instruments,
   along with a descent probe that it released directly into Jupiter’s
   atmosphere.

Accomplishments

Accomplishments

   Galileo changed the way we look at our solar system. When the
   spacecraft plunged into Jupiter's crushing atmosphere on Sept. 21,
   2003, it was being deliberately destroyed to protect one of its own
   discoveries—a possible ocean beneath the icy crust of the moon Europa.

   The spacecraft was the first to fly past an asteroid, Gaspra, and the
   first to discover a moon of an asteroid, tiny Dactyl orbiting Ida. It
   provided the only direct observations of a comet colliding with a
   planet, when it witnessed Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter.

   The Galileo spacecraft logged quite a few other firsts during its
   14-year mission to Jupiter. Among its discoveries: an intense radiation
   belt above Jupiter's cloud tops, helium in about the same concentration
   as the Sun, extensive and rapid resurfacing of the moon Io because of
   volcanism and a magnetic field at Ganymede.

   The orbiter carried a small probe that became the first to sample the
   atmosphere of a gas planet. The probe measured temperature, pressure,
   chemical composition, cloud characteristics, sunlight and energy
   internal to the planet, and lightning. During its 58-minute life, the
   probe penetrated 124 miles (200 kilometers) into Jupiter's violent
   atmosphere before it was crushed, melted and/or vaporized by the
   intense pressure and temperature.

   Galileo data allowed the creation of the first detailed maps of
   Jupiter’s major moons. It also gave scientists the most detailed look
   yet at the structure of the planet’s magnetic field and radiation
   belts.

   The Galileo mission is also an example of innovative problem solving.
   When the spacecraft’s main antenna failed to deploy as planned, a
   special team performed extensive tests and determined that a few
   (probably three) of the antenna's 18 ribs were held by friction in the
   closed position. Despite exhaustive efforts to free the ribs, the
   antenna would not deploy.

   From 1993 to 1996, extensive new flight and ground software was
   developed, and ground stations of NASA's Deep Space Network were
   enhanced in order to perform the mission using the spacecraft's
   low-gain antennas. Despite the fact that the spacecraft was millions of
   miles away in deep space, the fixes worked, and most of the mission’s
   planned observations were carried out.

   Jupiter's Storms and Rings

   Using data from the Galileo Probe's plunge into the top cloud layers of
   Jupiter, Galileo discovered that Jupiter has thunderstorms many times
   larger than Earth's. These storms result from the vertical circulation
   of water in the top layers, leaving large areas where air descends and
   becomes dry like the Sahara desert, and other areas where water rises
   to form the thunderstorms. Galileo has also found that Jupiter's rings
   are made of small dust grains blasted off the surface of Jupiter's four
   innermost satellites by the impacts of meteoroids.

   Hot Active Volcanoes on Io

   Now considered the solar system's most active body, Io's volcanoes were
   first discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979. They result from 328-foot (100
   meter) tides in its solid surface. By taking Io's temperature with
   Galileo's instruments, scientists now know that some of Io's volcanoes
   are hotter than Earth's. From this, scientists surmise that lava made
   of silicate material rich in magnesium erupts from below Io's surface.

   An Ocean on Europa

   Possessing more water than the total amount found on earth, Europa
   appears to have had a salty ocean beneath its icy cracked and frozen
   surface. Galileo images show ice "rafts" the size of cities that appear
   to have broken off and drifted apart, a frozen "puddle" smooths over
   older cracks, warmer material bubbles up from below to blister the
   surface, evaporative-type salts are exposed. A remarkable lack of
   craters shows the surface to be relatively young. Europa has a very
   thin oxygen atmosphere and an ionosphere.

   Ganymede's Magnetic Field

   Internal tidal friction causes surprising effects on the solar system's
   largest moon. Galileo revealed that Ganymede has its own magnetic
   field. Perhaps from a slightly different orbit in its past, enough heat
   from tidal friction caused the separation of material inside Ganymede
   and this stirring of a molten core or iron sulfide is believed to
   generate Ganymede's magnetic field.

   Does an Ocean Hide Beneath Callisto's Surface?

   There is evidence to support the existence of a subsurface ocean on
   Callisto. The ocean would have to be deep enough inside the moon that
   it does not affect the heavily cratered surface on top. Instead the
   ocean could be showing itself indirectly, through the magnetic field it
   generates. This could come from electric flow in a salty ocean
   generated by Jupiter's strong magnetic field passing through it.

Bonus Science

Bonus Science

   During one of Galileo’s extended missions, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft
   swung by Jupiter in late 2000 on its way to Saturn. For a few weeks,
   both Cassini and Galileo were able to simultaneously observe the giant
   planet in a coordinated campaign.

   Scientists and engineers also used Galileo’s extensive time near
   Jupiter to observe the effects of a powerful radiation field on the
   hardware and operations of a spacecraft.

Assembly, Testing and Launch

Assembly, Testing and Launch

   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the Galileo mission for NASA. It
   built and tested the spacecraft in Pasadena, Calif. NASA's Ames
   Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. managed the atmospheric
   descent probe, which was built by Hughes Aircraft Company. The German
   government supplied the propulsion module. The spacecraft’s electrical
   power came from radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which were
   designed and built by General Electric Co. for the U.S. Department of
   Energy.

   Unlike most planetary missions, which ride to space aboard an
   expendable rocket, Galileo set sail for Jupiter from the cargo bay of
   Space Shuttle Atlantis. Shuttle mission STS-34 lifted off from Kennedy
   Space Center’s Pad 39-B on Oct. 18, 1989. The crew included Donald E.
   Williams, Commander; Michael J. McCulley, Pilot; Franklin R.
   Chang-Diaz, Mission Specialist 1; Shannon W. Lucid, Mission Specialist
   2; and Ellen S. Baker, Mission Specialist 3.

   The shuttle crew released Galileo into space above Earth the same day,
   with Astronaut Shannon Lucid performing the delicate maneuvers. Then
   the two-stage Inertial Upper Stage rocket ignited to propel the
   spacecraft on its journey.

Cruise

Cruise

   Galileo didn't have enough fuel to fly directly to Jupiter, but the
   spacecraft borrowed energy from Venus and Earth to make the long trip.
   Mission planners designed a flight path nicknamed
   "VEEGA"—Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist. Galileo would slingshot once
   by Venus, and twice by Earth, gathering enough momentum to reach
   distant Jupiter.

   First stop: Venus. The Galileo team tried out the spacecraft's
   instruments and study of the thick, toxic clouds that cloak our sister
   planet. Flying by our home planet twice, Galileo saw the Earth and Moon
   together—as someone from another world might view us.

   After the first Earth flyby, Galileo's umbrella-shaped high-gain
   antenna did not open as planned. But the Galileo team worked to
   reprogram the spacecraft to send back data through a smaller antenna.
   Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network upgraded their antennas as well.
   The result allowed scientists to capture almost all the information
   originally planned.

   On Galileo's first trip through the asteroid belt, the spacecraft took
   detailed images of an asteroid named Gaspra—the first close approach to
   an asteroid. On a second pass through the asteroid belt, Galileo
   discovered a miniature moon orbiting asteroid Ida. This tiny body was
   named Dactyl.

   In 1994, Galileo was perfectly positioned to watch the fragments of
   comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 crash into Jupiter. The spacecraft made the only
   direct observations of the impact. Earth-based telescopes had to wait
   to see the impact sites as they rotated into view.

   In July 1995, the probe was released to begin a solo flight into
   Jupiter.

   Five months later, the probe sliced into Jupiter's atmosphere at
   106,000 mph (47 kilometers per second). It slowed, released its
   parachute, and dropped its heat shield. As the probe descended through
   95 miles (153 kilometers) of the top layers of the atmosphere, it
   collected 58 minutes of data on the local weather. The data were sent
   to the spacecraft overhead, then transmitted back to Earth.

   It appeared that Jupiter's atmosphere is drier than had been previously
   thought. Measurements from the probe showed few clouds, and lightning
   only in the distance. It was only later that we discovered that the
   probe had entered an area called a "hot spot."

   Towards the end of the 58-minute descent, the probe measured winds of
   450 mph (724 kilometers per hour)—stronger than anything on Earth. The
   probe was finally melted and vaporized by the intense heat of the
   atmosphere.

   To get into orbit around Jupiter, the spacecraft had to use its main
   engine. An error could send Galileo sailing past the planet. There was
   just one chance to get it right. After hours of anxious waiting,
   mission controllers confirmed that the spacecraft was safely in orbit.
   Galileo was alive and well and had begun its primary mission. The
   maneuver was precisely carried out, and Galileo entered orbit around
   Jupiter.

Primary Mission

Primary Mission

   On December 7, 1995 Galileo began its prime mission: a two-year study
   of the Jovian system.

   Galileo traveled around Jupiter in elongated ovals—each orbit lasted
   about two months. By traveling at different distances from Jupiter,
   Galileo could sample different parts of the planet's extensive
   magnetosphere. The orbits were designed for close-up flybys of
   Jupiter's largest moons.

   To keep track of Galileo's journey, each orbit was numbered, and named
   for the moon that the spacecraft encountered at closest range. During
   orbit "C-3" for example—the third orbit around Jupiter—Galileo flew
   near the moon Callisto.

   The data collected on Jupiter and the moons were stored on the on-board
   tape recorder. During the rest of the orbit, the data were sent to
   Earth using the low-gain antenna. At the same time, measurements are
   made of Jupiter's magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth.

   The intriguing data gathered during the eleven orbits of the prime
   mission left many questions to be answered. Since Galileo obviously was
   capable of much more, its mission was extended.

Extended Missions

Extended Missions

   Galileo's prime mission ended on December 7, 1997. With more to learn,
   and the spacecraft in good health, NASA approved a two-year study
   called "GEM"—the Galileo Europa Mission. For fourteen more orbits, the
   spacecraft focused on ice, water, and fire: the icy moon Europa, which
   might have an ocean; Jupiter's majestic thunderstorms; and the fiery
   volcanoes of Io.

   The spacecraft came so close to Europa that if there were something
   there the size of a school bus, Galileo would have detected it. The
   additional observations of Europa supported the theory that an ocean of
   water currently exists below the surface. NASA began considering plans
   for future missions to orbit Europa, and perhaps to send a lander.

   Approaching Io—Jupiter's innermost moon—meant surviving Jupiter's
   intense radiation, so these encounters were saved until last. When
   radiation upset the spacecraft's computer, engineers worked all night
   to get them back online. But Galileo came through again, and even
   observed a lava fountain erupting on Io.

   These successful flybys led to another exciting mission—the Galileo
   Millennium Mission, extending into 2001. Data was collected on Io and
   Europa, and studies made of the effects of radiation on a spacecraft
   close to Jupiter.

Spacecraft and Instruments

Spacecraft and Instruments

   Some scientific instruments on the Galileo spacecraft observed from a
   distance while others measured fields and particles directly. The
   Galileo atmospheric descent probe was dropped directly into Jupiter's
   cloudtops to collect data about the atmosphere.

   At launch, the orbiter weighed 2-1/2 tons (2,223 kilograms) and
   measured 17 feet (5.3 meters) from the top of the low-gain antenna to
   the bottom of the probe.

   There were 10 scientific instruments aboard the spacecraft. Some of the
   instruments were mounted on long arms so they didn’t pick up unwanted
   signals from the spacecraft. The probe used six instruments plus its
   radio to investigate Jupiter's atmosphere. In addition, scientists used
   Galileo's radio system for experiments.

   The orbiter featured an innovative "dual-spin" design. Most spacecraft
   are stabilized in flight either by spinning around a major axis, or by
   maintaining a fixed orientation in space, referenced to the Sun and
   another star. As the first dual-spin planetary spacecraft, Galileo
   combined these techniques. A spinning section rotated at about 3 rpm,
   and a "despun" section was counter-rotated to provide a fixed
   orientation for cameras and other remote sensors. A star scanner on the
   spinning side determined orientation and spin rate; gyroscopes on the
   despun side provided the basis for measuring turns and pointing
   instruments.

   The power supply, propulsion module and most of the computers and
   control electronics were mounted on the spinning section. The spinning
   section also carried instruments to study magnetic fields and charged
   particles. These instruments included magnetometer sensors mounted on a
   36-foot (11-meter) boom to minimize interference from the spacecraft's
   electronics; a plasma instrument to detect low-energy charged
   particles; and a plasma-wave detector to study electromagnetic waves
   generated by the particles. There was also a high-energy particle
   detector and a detector of cosmic and Jovian dust, an extreme
   ultraviolet detector associated with the ultraviolet spectrometer, and
   a heavy ion counter to assess potentially hazardous charged-particle
   environments the spacecraft flew through.

   Galileo's de-spun section carried instruments that need to be held
   steady. These instruments included the camera system; the near-infrared
   mapping spectrometer to make multispectral images for atmosphere and
   surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases;
   and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and reflected
   energy. The camera system obtained images of Jupiter's satellites at
   resolutions from 20 to 1,000 times better than the best possible from
   NASA's Voyager spacecraft; its charge-coupled-device (CCD) sensor was
   much more sensitive than previous spacecraft cameras and is able to
   detect a broader color band. Galileo's de-spun section also carries a
   dish antenna that picked up the descent probe's signals during its fall
   into Jupiter's atmosphere.

   The spacecraft's propulsion module consisted of 12 2.25-pound-force
   (10-newton) thrusters and a single 90-pound-force (400-newton) engine
   which used monomethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen-tetroxide oxidizer.
   The propulsion system was developed and built by
   Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) and provided by the Federal Republic
   of Germany as NASA's major international partner on Galileo.

   Because radio signals take more than one hour to travel from Earth to
   Jupiter and back, the Galileo spacecraft was designed to operate from
   computer instructions sent to it in advance and stored in spacecraft
   memory. A single master sequence of commands could cover a period
   ranging from weeks to months of quiet operations between flybys of
   Jupiter's moons. During busy encounter operations, one sequence of
   commands covered only about a week.

   These sequences operated through flight software installed in the
   spacecraft computers, with built-in automatic fault protection software
   designed to put Galileo in a safe state in case of computer glitches or
   other unforeseen circumstance.

   Electrical power was provided by two radioisotope thermoelectric
   generators. Heat produced by natural radioactive decay of plutonium was
   converted to electricity (570 watts at launch, 485 at the end of the
   mission) to operate the orbiter spacecraft's equipment. This is the
   same type of power source used on other NASA missions including Viking
   to Mars, Voyager and Pioneer to the outer planets, Ulysses to study the
   Sun, and Cassini to Saturn.

Descent Probe

Descent Probe

   Galileo's descent probe had a mass of 339 kilograms (750 pounds), and
   included a deceleration module to slow and protect the descent module.
   The probe measured about 50 inches (127 centimeters) in diameter.
   Inside the heat shield, the scientific instruments were protected from
   ferocious heat during entry. The probe had to withstand extreme heat
   and pressure on its high-speed journey at 106,000 miles per hour.

   The deceleration module consisted of an aeroshell and an aft cover
   designed to block heat generated by friction during atmospheric entry.
   Inside the aeroshells were the descent module and its 8-foot (2.5
   meter) parachute. The descent module carried a radio transmitter and
   seven scientific instruments. These were devices to measure
   temperature, pressure and deceleration, atmospheric composition,
   clouds, particles, and light and radio emissions from lightning and
   energetic particles in Jupiter's radiation belts.

The Latest

     * 10 Things: International Observe the Moon Night

   The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth
   a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its
   axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides,
   creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The
   Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.

   Our moon is the fifth largest of the 190+ moons orbiting planets in our
   solar system.

   Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because
   people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered
   four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.

   NASA currently has three robotic spacecraft exploring the Moon — Lunar
   Reconnaissance Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft (not to be
   confused with NASA's new Artemis program to send astronauts back to the
   Moon).

   The former Soviet Union logged the first successes with its Luna
   program, starting with Luna 1 in 1959. NASA followed with a series of
   robotic Ranger and Surveyor spacecraft that performed increasingly
   complex tasks that made it possible for the first human beings to walk
   on the Moon in 1969.

   Twenty-four humans have traveled from the Earth to the Moon. Twelve
   walked on its surface. The last human visited the lunar surface in
   1972.

   Now NASA is gearing up to set up a permanent lunar presence on the
   Moon. The Artemis program will send the first woman and the next man to
   the Moon and develop a sustainable human presence on the Moon and set
   the stage for further human exploration at Mars.

   The program takes its name from the twin sister of Apollo and goddess
   of the Moon in Greek mythology. Artemis 1, formerly Exploration
   Mission-1, is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions
   that will enable human exploration to the Moon and Mars.

   FAQ: What is a Lunar Eclipse?

FAQ: What is a Lunar Eclipse?

   A partial lunar eclipse will be visible in Africa and the Central
   Pacific on July 16, 2019 (Viewing Guide). During a lunar eclipse, Earth
   comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the sunlight falling on
   the Moon. There are two kinds of lunar eclipses:
     * A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon and Sun are on opposite
       sides of Earth.
     * A partial lunar eclipse happens when only part of Earth's shadow
       covers the Moon.
     * NASA Lunar Eclipse Guides: 2011-2020 and 2021-2030.

   During some stages of a lunar eclipse, the Moon can appear reddish.

   This is because the only remaining sunlight reaching the Moon at that
   point is from around the edges of the Earth, as seen from the Moon's
   surface. From there, an observer during an eclipse would see all
   Earth's sunrises and sunsets at once.

   Pop Culture

Pop Culture

   Our lunar neighbor has inspired stories since the first humans looked
   up at the sky and saw its grey, cratered surface. Some observers saw
   among the craters the shape of a person's face, so stories refer to a
   mysterious "man in the moon." Hungrier observers compared its craters
   to cheese and dreamed of an entire sphere made of delicious dairy
   products.

Apollo 50th Anniversary

     * Who has Walked on the Moon?

   The Moon made its film debut in a 1902 black and white silent French
   film called Le Voyage Dans la Lune (a Trip to the Moon). And a year
   before astronauts walked on the Moon, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) told
   the story of astronauts on an outpost on the Moon. Decades later, it is
   still widely regarded as one of the best science fiction movies ever
   made.Yep

   American astronauts have planted six American flags on the Moon. But
   that doesn't mean the United States has claimed it; in fact, an
   international law written in 1967 prevents any single nation from
   owning planets, stars, or any other natural objects in space.

   Kid-Friendly Moon

Kid-Friendly Moon

   Most of the planets in our solar system—and some asteroids—have moons.
   Earth has one moon. We call it "the Moon" because for a long time it
   was the only one we knew about. Many languages have beautiful words for
   Moon. It is "Luna" in Italian, Latin and Spanish, "Lune" in French,
   "Mond" in German, and "Selene" in Greek.

   Our Moon is like a desert with plains, mountains, and valleys. It also
   has many craters, holes created when space rocks hit the surface at a
   high speed. There is no air to breathe on the Moon.

   The Moon travels around the Earth in an oval shaped orbit. Scientists
   think the Moon was formed long, long ago when Earth crashed into a
   Mars-sized object.

   We always see the same side of the Moon from Earth. You have to go into
   space to see the other side.

Dawn

   MORE

ON THIS PAGE

   Dawn launched in 2007 on a journey that put about 4.3 billion miles
   (6.9 billion kilometers) on its odometer. Propelled by ion engines, the
   spacecraft achieved many firsts until its extended mission concluded on
   Nov. 1, 2018.

The Latest

     * Scientists Solve Mystery of Ceres' Lonely Mountain

   In 2011, when Dawn arrived at Vesta, the second largest world in the
   main asteroid belt, the spacecraft became the first to orbit a body in
   the region between Mars and Jupiter.

   In 2015, when Dawn went into orbit around Ceres, a dwarf planet that is
   also the largest world in the asteroid belt, the mission became the
   first to visit a dwarf planet and go into orbit around two destinations
   beyond Earth.

   Among its accomplishments, Dawn showed how important location was to
   the way objects in the early solar system formed and evolved. Dawn also
   reinforced the idea that dwarf planets could have hosted oceans over a
   significant part of their history – and potentially still do. The data
   Dawn beamed back to Earth from its four science experiments enabled
   scientists to compare two planet-like worlds that evolved very
   differently.

   10 Things to Know About Dawn

10 Need-to-Know Things About Dawn

   1

Two-for-One First

   Dawn was the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial
   destinations (Vesta and Ceres).
   2

And ... First Orbit

   When Dawn arrived at Vesta, it became the first spacecraft to orbit an
   object in the main asteroid belt
   3

And ... First Look

   When Dawn arrived at Ceres, it was the first spacecraft to visit a
   dwarf planet

Full View of Vesta

   4

Location, Location, Location

   Dawn showed us that location was key to how the early system organized
   and evolved.
   5

Ocean Worlds

   Dawn reinforced that dwarf planets, not just icy moons, could have
   hosted oceans during a large part of their history—and potentially
   still do.
   6

Building Blocks of Life

   Dawn found organics at Ceres and left us wanting to know more.
   7

Science Fiction to Fact

   Star Wars’ far-ranging “TIE” fighters stand for “twin ion engine.”
   Thanks to its own ion engines, Dawn broke several exploration records.
   8

More than a Space Rock

   Dawn found Vesta was a more varied world than scientists expected.
   9

Bright Spots

   Dawn revealed that Ceres is geologically active—or was very recently.
   10

Science to the End

   Dawn gathered science data at Ceres and returned it to Earth right up
   to the point the spacecraft ran out of fuel.

   Major Engineering Achievements

Major Engineering Achievements

     * First space mission to orbit two destinations
     * Record-breaking use of solar-electric propulsion: 25,700 mph, 2.7x
       any prior spacecraft and nearly equal to the velocity provided by
       Dawn’s Delta launch vehicle
     * Active powered flight: 5.9 years (54% of the time in space as of
       Sep. 7, 2018)

   Key Mission Findings

Key Mission Findings

   Dawn orbited Vesta for more than a year, from July 2011 to September
   2012. Its investigation confirmed that Vesta is the parent of the HED
   (howardites, eucrites, and diogenites) meteorites, which Dawn connected
   to Vesta’s large south polar basin, a priceless cosmic connection
   between samples in hand and a singular event on a small planet.
   Sheer walls of impact crater on asteroid. The ejected material from
   this young crater in the Rheasilvia impact basin likely comes from deep
   inside Vesta. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA | › Full Image
   and Caption

   Vesta is small enough (about the same size as Saturn's moon Enceladus)
   to have been deeply scarred by the Rheasilvia impact that launched the
   HEDs, but large enough to have differentiated into an iron core,
   silicate mantle, and igneous crust. Dawn also found hydrated and carbon
   rich material on its surface supplied by impactors, a result that was
   unexpected based on pre-Dawn telescopic observations.

   After its escape from Vesta and its journey onward, Dawn entered orbit
   around Ceres in March 2015. Dawn discovered that the inner solar
   system’s only dwarf planet was an ocean world where water and ammonia
   reacted with silicate rocks. As the ocean froze, salts and other
   telltale minerals concentrated into deposits that are now exposed in
   many locations across the surface. Dawn also found organics in several
   locations on Ceres’ surface.

Ashley Davies

Volcanologist

NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Where are you from?

   I'm from London, England.

What first sparked your interest in space?

   When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon and Neil Armstrong took his giant
   leap for mankind, it was early in the morning in the U.K. To this day,
   I clearly remember my mother coming into the bedroom and asking if
   anyone was awake and I spoke up. It was just after 3 a.m., July 21,
   1969. The next thing I knew, I was bundled up on the living room sofa
   with my mother, watching this astonishing event unfold on our black and
   white TV.

How did you end up working in the space program?

   I got interested in planetary science, volcanoes in particular, when I
   was in high school in England. Two events took place that had a great
   effect on me. At the time, I had no idea how these would shape my life
   and lead me to where I am today. The first thing that fired my
   imagination regarding planetary science was in 1979, when the NASA
   Voyager spacecraft discovered active volcanoes on Io, one of the moons
   of Jupiter. I knew about Io, I'd seen it through my telescope, but the
   fact that it had active, erupting volcanoes was wonderful to me—the
   conventional wisdom of the time said all of these outer solar system
   moons were inert, dead ice balls.

   The second interesting event was the following year, when Mount St.
   Helens erupted—and showed how even the mainland United States was
   vulnerable to volcanic eruptions. My love of astronomy has stayed with
   me all my life, and kept me focused on my studies through high school.
   I worked hard as an undergraduate, and focused more on geology, which
   was new to me, but which I found fascinating. My final year project
   examined volcanoes on Earth and Mars. I moved on to a Ph.D. at
   Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, where I studied volcanoes
   on Io and how they might erupt. I was lucky to be mentored by
   Professors Lionel Wilson and Harry Pinkerton. Lionel, especially was
   (and still is) at the forefront of mathematical volcanology, uncovering
   the secrets of volcanic eruptions through an understanding of the
   underlying physics. I finally ended up at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
   (JPL) in 1994 as a post-doctoral associate, studying Io's volcanoes,
   and then I was on the Galileo science team. I'm still at it, studying
   the extraordinary volcanoes on Io and also those on Earth. I now
   consider myself to be an Io expert—I have even written the definitive
   book on Io's volcanoes.

   The first thing that fired my imagination regarding planetary science
   was in 1979, when the NASA Voyager spacecraft discovered active
   volcanoes on Io.

What is a volcanologist?

   I study volcanoes—how they erupt, and why—and what they tell us about
   the interior not only of the Earth, but other planets and satellites
   across the solar system. Volcanoes have had a tremendous effect on the
   evolution of all the solid planets and many of the moons in the solar
   system. Volcanoes are windows into the interior of a planet—we see what
   the interior is made of because volcanoes erupt this stuff onto the
   surface where spacecraft can see it. Studying them here on Earth helps
   us understand how they work out there.

   Visiting Erta'Ale in Ethiopia in 2009.

What was it like the first time you witnessed a volcano erupt?

   The first volcano I saw actually in eruption was Kilauea volcano,
   Hawai’i. I was with my Ph.D. advisor (Prof. Lionel Wilson) and he hired
   a light plane for an overflight of the volcano. This was in 1988. When
   the pilot found out we were volcanologists he gave us a grand tour,
   standing the plane almost on its wingtip as we circled low over the
   Kupaianaha lava lake. The lake was very active, and it was a
   spectacular sight. I was well and truly hooked.

Do you have a favorite volcano?

   On Earth, it's probably a toss-up between Erebus in Antarctica and
   Erta’Ale in Ethiopia. Both volcanoes have an active lava lake at their
   summits. The Erta’Ale lava lake in particular is likely a great
   analogue for some volcanic features on Io. It is also a perfectly
   mesmerizing sight, as the lava roils away under a thin crust, and
   occasionally lava fountains form, which are quite a sight (especially
   at night). I have a fond memory of sitting on the edge of the crater
   late one evening, watching the lake perform and just enjoying the
   spectacle.

What have been some favorite moments in your career so far?

   In 2009 I traveled to the hottest place on Earth, the Afar region of
   Ethiopia. In August the temperature was over 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50
   degrees Celsius). And in the Afar is the volcano Erta'Ale. This volcano
   has a very rare volcanic feature, an active lava lake, which in 2009
   was about 55 m in diameter. This is a churning, spitting, cauldron of
   molten rock. I was amazed to hear the whooshing as the lava lake
   churned away, to smell and taste the acrid gases escaping from the
   lava, and to feel the blast of heat from the molten rock. I was there
   filming a sequence about Io for a television series called "Wonders of
   the Solar System," created by the British Broadcasting Corporation
   (BBC), and it was an amazing experience standing above this
   extraordinary lava lake discussing volcanoes on Io. The lava lake
   somehow reminded me of a tiger: beautiful to look at, a creature of
   immense power that was barely restrained, but if you got too close or
   were unlucky—well, it could take your arm off.

   A few years ago I went to Antarctica to another lava lake at the summit
   of Mount Erebus, the world's most southerly erupting volcano. There the
   temperature was typically -58 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 degrees Celsius).
   So my job has taken me to the absolute extreme places on Earth, as well
   as to Io (via spacecraft, at least!)

How do you overcome challenges?

   Never, never, never surrender to circumstance. You come up with a Plan
   B, and if that doesn’t work, then a Plan C. Exhaust the alphabet, if
   necessary.

What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path
as you?

   A foundation in physics and mathematics is a great help. From an early
   age I was interested in astronomy. The process never ends—I'm still
   learning. Simply put, a lot of my job concerns heat. I think about how
   heat is lost from an object to its surroundings, and how heat loss
   affects the body losing heat. The object in question could be a planet,
   or a moon, or an individual lava flow or lake. A lot of the job is
   identifying the processes taking place and using physics to understand
   them under conditions on different planets. To do my job you really
   need a Ph.D. It is a lot of work, but it is immensely rewarding.

What do you do for fun?

   It sounds trite, but my work is really fun. I enjoy it so much that it
   is difficult to separate it from out of work activities as I am
   constantly thinking about what to do next with volcanoes. My very
   understanding wife cuts me a lot of slack! But I read
   voraciously—military history, thrillers, mysteries, science fiction and
   books on the history of science. I adore movies, and think that "The
   Big Bang Theory" is not only the funniest thing on TV but reminds me of
   some of the people I work with—really.

What are some of your favorite science fiction books and authors?

   I read science fiction voraciously. Growing up I read a lot of Arthur
   C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov. One of my favorite Clark novels is “The
   Fountains of Paradise”, and I love his many short stories. Try the
   collection published in “Tales from the White Hart”. Asimov came up
   with “I, Robot” and others, terrific stories exploring the morality and
   ethics of early A.I. Another favourite: Robert Heinlein’s “The Moon is
   a Harsh Mistress”. In recent years I have hugely enjoyed the work of
   David Brin, Kim Stanley Robinson (his trilogy of martian novels “Red
   Mars”, “Green Mars” and “Blue Mars” is just fascinating; and “2312”;
   and “Aurora”) and the novels of Neal Stephenson – including
   “Seveneves,” which has the most gripping opening line of any novel I
   have ever read.

If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or
engineering, what advice would you give them?

   We are living in a new golden age of planetary exploration—there are
   spacecraft exploring the solar system from one end to the other, and
   now JPL is engaged in planning the next big mission to the Jupiter
   system. It won't arrive for many years, and a lot of scientists and
   engineers will be needed—to work on communications, propulsion,
   instrument design, project management, spacecraft design, scientists to
   establish the science goals of the mission, the observations that need
   to be made to meet those goals, the instruments needed to make the
   observations, and finally to analyze the data collected. So to get to
   JPL, work hard in school. Find a subject that you enjoy and stick with
   it. When you hit a rough patch (yes, I certainly hit a few), remember
   how much you love this subject and use that to regain your footing. I
   have always had a great deal of self-motivation, and that was a great
   help. Once you set your mind to do something, keep at it to achieve
   your goals. Be disciplined in your approach to work. Don't accept
   compromises regarding the quality of your work. Strive to be the best
   in your chosen field.

Galileo Sees Io Erupt

   volcanic plume visible over the limb of the moon Io
   Source: NASA/JPL/DLR
   Published: August 28, 2018
   Historical Date: June 28, 1997

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft caught Jupiter's moon Io, the planet’s
   third-largest moon, undergoing a volcanic eruption.

   Locked in a perpetual tug of war between the imposing gravity of
   Jupiter and the smaller, consistent pulls of its neighboring moons,
   Io’s distorted orbit causes it to flex as it swoops around the gas
   giant. The stretching causes friction and intense heat in Io’s
   interior, sparking massive eruptions across its surface.

   Four spacecraft (Pioneer 10 & 11, then Voyager 1 & 2) had previously
   flown by the Jupiter system, but the Galileo mission was the first to
   enter orbit around the planet. Like the famed astronomer for which it
   was named, Galileo would study the King of Planets over an extended
   period, in finer detail than was ever possible before.

   To accomplish this, the Galileo orbiter carried 10 science instruments,
   along with a descent probe that it released directly into Jupiter’s
   atmosphere.

Accomplishments

Accomplishments

   Galileo changed the way we look at our solar system. When the
   spacecraft plunged into Jupiter's crushing atmosphere on Sept. 21,
   2003, it was being deliberately destroyed to protect one of its own
   discoveries—a possible ocean beneath the icy crust of the moon Europa.

   The spacecraft was the first to fly past an asteroid, Gaspra, and the
   first to discover a moon of an asteroid, tiny Dactyl orbiting Ida. It
   provided the only direct observations of a comet colliding with a
   planet, when it witnessed Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter.

   The Galileo spacecraft logged quite a few other firsts during its
   14-year mission to Jupiter. Among its discoveries: an intense radiation
   belt above Jupiter's cloud tops, helium in about the same concentration
   as the Sun, extensive and rapid resurfacing of the moon Io because of
   volcanism and a magnetic field at Ganymede.

   The orbiter carried a small probe that became the first to sample the
   atmosphere of a gas planet. The probe measured temperature, pressure,
   chemical composition, cloud characteristics, sunlight and energy
   internal to the planet, and lightning. During its 58-minute life, the
   probe penetrated 124 miles (200 kilometers) into Jupiter's violent
   atmosphere before it was crushed, melted and/or vaporized by the
   intense pressure and temperature.

   Galileo data allowed the creation of the first detailed maps of
   Jupiter’s major moons. It also gave scientists the most detailed look
   yet at the structure of the planet’s magnetic field and radiation
   belts.

   The Galileo mission is also an example of innovative problem solving.
   When the spacecraft’s main antenna failed to deploy as planned, a
   special team performed extensive tests and determined that a few
   (probably three) of the antenna's 18 ribs were held by friction in the
   closed position. Despite exhaustive efforts to free the ribs, the
   antenna would not deploy.

   From 1993 to 1996, extensive new flight and ground software was
   developed, and ground stations of NASA's Deep Space Network were
   enhanced in order to perform the mission using the spacecraft's
   low-gain antennas. Despite the fact that the spacecraft was millions of
   miles away in deep space, the fixes worked, and most of the mission’s
   planned observations were carried out.

   Jupiter's Storms and Rings

   Using data from the Galileo Probe's plunge into the top cloud layers of
   Jupiter, Galileo discovered that Jupiter has thunderstorms many times
   larger than Earth's. These storms result from the vertical circulation
   of water in the top layers, leaving large areas where air descends and
   becomes dry like the Sahara desert, and other areas where water rises
   to form the thunderstorms. Galileo has also found that Jupiter's rings
   are made of small dust grains blasted off the surface of Jupiter's four
   innermost satellites by the impacts of meteoroids.

   Hot Active Volcanoes on Io

   Now considered the solar system's most active body, Io's volcanoes were
   first discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979. They result from 328-foot (100
   meter) tides in its solid surface. By taking Io's temperature with
   Galileo's instruments, scientists now know that some of Io's volcanoes
   are hotter than Earth's. From this, scientists surmise that lava made
   of silicate material rich in magnesium erupts from below Io's surface.

   An Ocean on Europa

   Possessing more water than the total amount found on earth, Europa
   appears to have had a salty ocean beneath its icy cracked and frozen
   surface. Galileo images show ice "rafts" the size of cities that appear
   to have broken off and drifted apart, a frozen "puddle" smooths over
   older cracks, warmer material bubbles up from below to blister the
   surface, evaporative-type salts are exposed. A remarkable lack of
   craters shows the surface to be relatively young. Europa has a very
   thin oxygen atmosphere and an ionosphere.

   Ganymede's Magnetic Field

   Internal tidal friction causes surprising effects on the solar system's
   largest moon. Galileo revealed that Ganymede has its own magnetic
   field. Perhaps from a slightly different orbit in its past, enough heat
   from tidal friction caused the separation of material inside Ganymede
   and this stirring of a molten core or iron sulfide is believed to
   generate Ganymede's magnetic field.

   Does an Ocean Hide Beneath Callisto's Surface?

   There is evidence to support the existence of a subsurface ocean on
   Callisto. The ocean would have to be deep enough inside the moon that
   it does not affect the heavily cratered surface on top. Instead the
   ocean could be showing itself indirectly, through the magnetic field it
   generates. This could come from electric flow in a salty ocean
   generated by Jupiter's strong magnetic field passing through it.

Bonus Science

   During one of Galileo’s extended missions, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft
   swung by Jupiter in late 2000 on its way to Saturn. For a few weeks,
   both Cassini and Galileo were able to simultaneously observe the giant
   planet in a coordinated campaign.

   Scientists and engineers also used Galileo’s extensive time near
   Jupiter to observe the effects of a powerful radiation field on the
   hardware and operations of a spacecraft.

Assembly, Testing and Launch

Assembly, Testing and Launch

   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the Galileo mission for NASA. It
   built and tested the spacecraft in Pasadena, Calif. NASA's Ames
   Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. managed the atmospheric
   descent probe, which was built by Hughes Aircraft Company. The German
   government supplied the propulsion module. The spacecraft’s electrical
   power came from radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which were
   designed and built by General Electric Co. for the U.S. Department of
   Energy.

   Unlike most planetary missions, which ride to space aboard an
   expendable rocket, Galileo set sail for Jupiter from the cargo bay of
   Space Shuttle Atlantis. Shuttle mission STS-34 lifted off from Kennedy
   Space Center’s Pad 39-B on Oct. 18, 1989. The crew included Donald E.
   Williams, Commander; Michael J. McCulley, Pilot; Franklin R.
   Chang-Diaz, Mission Specialist 1; Shannon W. Lucid, Mission Specialist
   2; and Ellen S. Baker, Mission Specialist 3.

   The shuttle crew released Galileo into space above Earth the same day,
   with Astronaut Shannon Lucid performing the delicate maneuvers. Then
   the two-stage Inertial Upper Stage rocket ignited to propel the
   spacecraft on its journey.

Cruise

Cruise

   Galileo didn't have enough fuel to fly directly to Jupiter, but the
   spacecraft borrowed energy from Venus and Earth to make the long trip.
   Mission planners designed a flight path nicknamed
   "VEEGA"—Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist. Galileo would slingshot once
   by Venus, and twice by Earth, gathering enough momentum to reach
   distant Jupiter.

   First stop: Venus. The Galileo team tried out the spacecraft's
   instruments and study of the thick, toxic clouds that cloak our sister
   planet. Flying by our home planet twice, Galileo saw the Earth and Moon
   together—as someone from another world might view us.

   After the first Earth flyby, Galileo's umbrella-shaped high-gain
   antenna did not open as planned. But the Galileo team worked to
   reprogram the spacecraft to send back data through a smaller antenna.
   Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network upgraded their antennas as well.
   The result allowed scientists to capture almost all the information
   originally planned.

   On Galileo's first trip through the asteroid belt, the spacecraft took
   detailed images of an asteroid named Gaspra—the first close approach to
   an asteroid. On a second pass through the asteroid belt, Galileo
   discovered a miniature moon orbiting asteroid Ida. This tiny body was
   named Dactyl.

   In 1994, Galileo was perfectly positioned to watch the fragments of
   comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 crash into Jupiter. The spacecraft made the only
   direct observations of the impact. Earth-based telescopes had to wait
   to see the impact sites as they rotated into view.

Arrival

Arrival

   The Galileo spacecraft and probe traveled as one for almost six years.
   In July 1995, the probe was released to begin a solo flight into
   Jupiter.

   Five months later, the probe sliced into Jupiter's atmosphere at
   106,000 mph (47 kilometers per second). It slowed, released its
   parachute, and dropped its heat shield. As the probe descended through
   95 miles (153 kilometers) of the top layers of the atmosphere, it
   collected 58 minutes of data on the local weather. The data were sent
   to the spacecraft overhead, then transmitted back to Earth.

   It appeared that Jupiter's atmosphere is drier than had been previously
   thought. Measurements from the probe showed few clouds, and lightning
   only in the distance. It was only later that we discovered that the
   probe had entered an area called a "hot spot."

   Towards the end of the 58-minute descent, the probe measured winds of
   450 mph (724 kilometers per hour)—stronger than anything on Earth. The
   probe was finally melted and vaporized by the intense heat of the
   atmosphere.

   To get into orbit around Jupiter, the spacecraft had to use its main
   engine. An error could send Galileo sailing past the planet. There was
   just one chance to get it right. After hours of anxious waiting,
   mission controllers confirmed that the spacecraft was safely in orbit.
   Galileo was alive and well and had begun its primary mission. The
   maneuver was precisely carried out, and Galileo entered orbit around
   Jupiter.

Primary Mission

Primary Mission

   On December 7, 1995 Galileo began its prime mission: a two-year study
   of the Jovian system.

   Galileo traveled around Jupiter in elongated ovals—each orbit lasted
   about two months. By traveling at different distances from Jupiter,
   Galileo could sample different parts of the planet's extensive
   magnetosphere. The orbits were designed for close-up flybys of
   Jupiter's largest moons.

   To keep track of Galileo's journey, each orbit was numbered, and named
   for the moon that the spacecraft encountered at closest range. During
   orbit "C-3" for example—the third orbit around Jupiter—Galileo flew
   near the moon Callisto.

   The data collected on Jupiter and the moons were stored on the on-board
   tape recorder. During the rest of the orbit, the data were sent to
   Earth using the low-gain antenna. At the same time, measurements are
   made of Jupiter's magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth.

   The intriguing data gathered during the eleven orbits of the prime
   mission left many questions to be answered. Since Galileo obviously was
   capable of much more, its mission was extended.

Extended Missions

Extended Missions

   Galileo's prime mission ended on December 7, 1997. With more to learn,
   and the spacecraft in good health, NASA approved a two-year study
   called "GEM"—the Galileo Europa Mission. For fourteen more orbits, the
   spacecraft focused on ice, water, and fire: the icy moon Europa, which
   might have an ocean; Jupiter's majestic thunderstorms; and the fiery
   volcanoes of Io.

   The spacecraft came so close to Europa that if there were something
   there the size of a school bus, Galileo would have detected it. The
   additional observations of Europa supported the theory that an ocean of
   water currently exists below the surface. NASA began considering plans
   for future missions to orbit Europa, and perhaps to send a lander.

   Approaching Io—Jupiter's innermost moon—meant surviving Jupiter's
   intense radiation, so these encounters were saved until last. When
   radiation upset the spacecraft's computer, engineers worked all night
   to get them back online. But Galileo came through again, and even
   observed a lava fountain erupting on Io.

   These successful flybys led to another exciting mission—the Galileo
   Millennium Mission, extending into 2001. Data was collected on Io and
   Europa, and studies made of the effects of radiation on a spacecraft
   close to Jupiter.

Spacecraft and Instruments

Spacecraft and Instruments

   Some scientific instruments on the Galileo spacecraft observed from a
   distance while others measured fields and particles directly. The
   Galileo atmospheric descent probe was dropped directly into Jupiter's
   cloudtops to collect data about the atmosphere.

   At launch, the orbiter weighed 2-1/2 tons (2,223 kilograms) and
   measured 17 feet (5.3 meters) from the top of the low-gain antenna to
   the bottom of the probe.

   There were 10 scientific instruments aboard the spacecraft. Some of the
   instruments were mounted on long arms so they didn’t pick up unwanted
   signals from the spacecraft. The probe used six instruments plus its
   radio to investigate Jupiter's atmosphere. In addition, scientists used
   Galileo's radio system for experiments.

   The orbiter featured an innovative "dual-spin" design. Most spacecraft
   are stabilized in flight either by spinning around a major axis, or by
   maintaining a fixed orientation in space, referenced to the Sun and
   another star. As the first dual-spin planetary spacecraft, Galileo
   combined these techniques. A spinning section rotated at about 3 rpm,
   and a "despun" section was counter-rotated to provide a fixed
   orientation for cameras and other remote sensors. A star scanner on the
   spinning side determined orientation and spin rate; gyroscopes on the
   despun side provided the basis for measuring turns and pointing
   instruments.

   The power supply, propulsion module and most of the computers and
   control electronics were mounted on the spinning section. The spinning
   section also carried instruments to study magnetic fields and charged
   particles. These instruments included magnetometer sensors mounted on a
   36-foot (11-meter) boom to minimize interference from the spacecraft's
   electronics; a plasma instrument to detect low-energy charged
   particles; and a plasma-wave detector to study electromagnetic waves
   generated by the particles. There was also a high-energy particle
   detector and a detector of cosmic and Jovian dust, an extreme
   ultraviolet detector associated with the ultraviolet spectrometer, and
   a heavy ion counter to assess potentially hazardous charged-particle
   environments the spacecraft flew through.

   Galileo's de-spun section carried instruments that need to be held
   steady. These instruments included the camera system; the near-infrared
   mapping spectrometer to make multispectral images for atmosphere and
   surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases;
   and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and reflected
   energy. The camera system obtained images of Jupiter's satellites at
   resolutions from 20 to 1,000 times better than the best possible from
   NASA's Voyager spacecraft; its charge-coupled-device (CCD) sensor was
   much more sensitive than previous spacecraft cameras and is able to
   detect a broader color band. Galileo's de-spun section also carries a
   dish antenna that picked up the descent probe's signals during its fall
   into Jupiter's atmosphere.

   The spacecraft's propulsion module consisted of 12 2.25-pound-force
   (10-newton) thrusters and a single 90-pound-force (400-newton) engine
   which used monomethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen-tetroxide oxidizer.
   The propulsion system was developed and built by
   Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) and provided by the Federal Republic
   of Germany as NASA's major international partner on Galileo.

   Because radio signals take more than one hour to travel from Earth to
   Jupiter and back, the Galileo spacecraft was designed to operate from
   computer instructions sent to it in advance and stored in spacecraft
   memory. A single master sequence of commands could cover a period
   ranging from weeks to months of quiet operations between flybys of
   Jupiter's moons. During busy encounter operations, one sequence of
   commands covered only about a week.

   These sequences operated through flight software installed in the
   spacecraft computers, with built-in automatic fault protection software
   designed to put Galileo in a safe state in case of computer glitches or
   other unforeseen circumstance.

   Electrical power was provided by two radioisotope thermoelectric
   generators. Heat produced by natural radioactive decay of plutonium was
   converted to electricity (570 watts at launch, 485 at the end of the
   mission) to operate the orbiter spacecraft's equipment. This is the
   same type of power source used on other NASA missions including Viking
   to Mars, Voyager and Pioneer to the outer planets, Ulysses to study the
   Sun, and Cassini to Saturn.

Descent Probe

Descent Probe

   Galileo's descent probe had a mass of 339 kilograms (750 pounds), and
   included a deceleration module to slow and protect the descent module.
   The probe measured about 50 inches (127 centimeters) in diameter.
   Inside the heat shield, the scientific instruments were protected from
   ferocious heat during entry. The probe had to withstand extreme heat
   and pressure on its high-speed journey at 106,000 miles per hour.

   The deceleration module consisted of an aeroshell and an aft cover
   designed to block heat generated by friction during atmospheric entry.
   Inside the aeroshells were the descent module and its 8-foot (2.5
   meter) parachute. The descent module carried a radio transmitter and
   seven scientific instruments. These were devices to measure
   temperature, pressure and deceleration, atmospheric composition,
   clouds, particles, and light and radio emissions from lightning and
   energetic particles in Jupiter's radiation belts.

   Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.

The Latest

     * 10 Things: International Observe the Moon Night

   The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth
   a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its
   axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides,
   creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The
   Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.

   Our moon is the fifth largest of the 190+ moons orbiting planets in our
   solar system.

   Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because
   people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered
   four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.

   NASA currently has three robotic spacecraft exploring the Moon — Lunar
   Reconnaissance Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft (not to be
   confused with NASA's new Artemis program to send astronauts back to the
   Moon).

   10 Need-to-Know Facts About the Moon

10 Need-to-Know Things About the Moon

   1

Small Companion

   If you set a single green pea next to U.S. nickel, you'd have a pretty
   good idea of the size of the Moon compared to Earth.
   2

Constant Companion

   The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It goes around the Earth at
   a distance of about 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers).
   3

Locked Up

   The Earth and Moon are tidally-locked. Their rotations are so in
   sync we only see one side of the Moon all the time. Human's didn't see
   the lunar far side until a Soviet spaecraft flew past in 1959.

Viewing Copernicus

   4

Can Stand on It

   The Moon is a rocky, solid-surface body with much of its surface
   cratered and pitted from impacts.
   5

Bring a Spacesuit

   The Moon has a very thin and tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. It
   is not breathable.
   6

Moonless

   The Moon has no moons.
   7

Ringless

   The Moon has no rings.
   8

Many Visitors

   More than 105 robotic spacecraft have been launched to explore the
   Moon. It is the only celestial body beyond Earth—so far—visited by
   human beings.
   9

Potential for Life?

   The Moon's weak atmosphere and its lack of liquid water cannot support
   life as we know it.
   10

Moonwalkers

   Apollo astronauts brought back a total of 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of
   lunar rocks and soil to Earth. We are still studying them.

Exploration

   The Moon was the first place beyond Earth humans tried to reach as the
   Space Age began in the last 1950s. More than 100 robotic explorers from
   more than half a dozen nations have since sent spacecraft to the Moon.
   Nine crewed missions have flown to the Moon and back.

   The former Soviet Union logged the first successes with its Luna
   program, starting with Luna 1 in 1959. NASA followed with a series of
   robotic Ranger and Surveyor spacecraft that performed increasingly
   complex tasks that made it possible for the first human beings to walk
   on the Moon in 1969.

   Twenty-four humans have traveled from the Earth to the Moon. Twelve
   walked on its surface. The last human visited the lunar surface in
   1972.

   Now NASA is gearing up to set up a permanent lunar presence on the
   Moon. The Artemis program will send the first woman and the next man to
   the Moon and develop a sustainable human presence on the Moon and set
   the stage for further human exploration at Mars.

   The program takes its name from the twin sister of Apollo and goddess
   of the Moon in Greek mythology. Artemis 1, formerly Exploration
   Mission-1, is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions
   that will enable human exploration to the Moon and Mars.

   FAQ: What is a Lunar Eclipse?

FAQ: What is a Lunar Eclipse?

   A partial lunar eclipse will be visible in Africa and the Central
   Pacific on July 16, 2019 (Viewing Guide). During a lunar eclipse, Earth
   comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the sunlight falling on
   the Moon. There are two kinds of lunar eclipses:
     * A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon and Sun are on opposite
       sides of Earth.
     * A partial lunar eclipse happens when only part of Earth's shadow
       covers the Moon.
     * NASA Lunar Eclipse Guides: 2011-2020 and 2021-2030.

   During some stages of a lunar eclipse, the Moon can appear reddish.

   This is because the only remaining sunlight reaching the Moon at that
   point is from around the edges of the Earth, as seen from the Moon's
   surface. From there, an observer during an eclipse would see all
   Earth's sunrises and sunsets at once.

   All About Lunar Eclipses ›

   Pop Culture

Pop Culture

   Our lunar neighbor has inspired stories since the first humans looked
   up at the sky and saw its grey, cratered surface. Some observers saw
   among the craters the shape of a person's face, so stories refer to a
   mysterious "man in the moon." Hungrier observers compared its craters
   to cheese and dreamed of an entire sphere made of delicious dairy
   products.

Apollo 50th Anniversary

     * Who has Walked on the Moon?

   The Moon made its film debut in a 1902 black and white silent French
   film called Le Voyage Dans la Lune (a Trip to the Moon). And a year
   before astronauts walked on the Moon, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) told
   the story of astronauts on an outpost on the Moon. Decades later, it is
   still widely regarded as one of the best science fiction movies ever
   made.Yep

   American astronauts have planted six American flags on the Moon. But
   that doesn't mean the United States has claimed it; in fact, an
   international law written in 1967 prevents any single nation from
   owning planets, stars, or any other natural objects in space.

   Kid-Friendly Moon

Kid-Friendly Moon

   Most of the planets in our solar system—and some asteroids—have moons.
   Earth has one moon. We call it "the Moon" because for a long time it
   was the only one we knew about. Many languages have beautiful words for
   Moon. It is "Luna" in Italian, Latin and Spanish, "Lune" in French,
   "Mond" in German, and "Selene" in Greek.

   Our Moon is like a desert with plains, mountains, and valleys. It also
   has many craters, holes created when space rocks hit the surface at a
   high speed. There is no air to breathe on the Moon.

   The Moon travels around the Earth in an oval shaped orbit. Scientists
   think the Moon was formed long, long ago when Earth crashed into a
   Mars-sized object.

   We always see the same side of the Moon from Earth. You have to go into
   space to see the other side.
