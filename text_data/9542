Next generation technology for virus/viral vector imaging applied in
antiviral screening, gene delivery and oncolytic virotherapies


ANCHOR3

NeoVirTech has developed a breakthrough technology to directly visualize and
quantify in real time virus/viral vector infection and replication in living
cells. NeoVirTech possesses the exclusive worldwide license for the ANCHOR^TM
technology, a new generation of autofluorescent system allowing the
visualization of viral DNA in living cells.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The ANCHOR system is composed of two parts:
    1. The ANCH sequence: short (from 200NT to 1kb) and unique (non
       repetitive), the sequence contains nucleation seeds for the binding
       of OR proteins. Insertion of the sequence in the viral genome does
       not perturb DNA metabolism or virus production.
    2. The OR-fluorescent protein expressing gene which specifically
       recognizes and spreads on the ANCH sequence, triggering the
       formation of a fluorescent focus easily detectable and quantifiable
       by microscopy (either classical or High Content). The strong
       accumulation of OR-FP protein onto its cognate ANCH sequence (up to
       500 OR-FP/ANCH) is far enough to detect single DNA molecules.
       Therefore, fluorescent spot corresponds to the position of a single
       viral DNA copy.
     __________________________________________________________________



     *

   The ANCH sequence is cloned upstream of the Or-FP expressing gene and
   inserted directly inside the DNA of interest (plasmid, gene,
   transposon, virus, viral vector used in gene therapy or oncolytic
   products). This autonomous ANCHOR cassette will convert target DNA into
   an autofluorescent molecule. NeoVirTech can use up to four different
   ANCHOR systems, with different length and fused to their corresponding
   fluorescent proteins, that can be used in combinations to detect
   several class of DNA simultaneously. Using the ANCHOR^TM technology,
   fitness studies visualizing co-infection of several viruses in real
   time are now possible.

High Content Screening
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our  viruses are especially suitable for high content screening
   campaign, combined with deep in cell imaging using high resolution
   microscopy, for the discovery of active compounds. We offer several
   screening models for antiviral discovery in human and animal health. We
   also propose screening services using your own models (such as
   oncolytic or gene therapy products) and our internal compound libraries
   (1200 FDA approved compounds). This service has proven to be efficient
   in the discovery of antiviral, vaccine adjuvant or oncolytic modulators
   (activator/inhibitor).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Classical Workflow:
     * Assignment of a dedicated project manager
     * Library collection and formatting if necessary.
     * Compound activity screening (several viral models and cell lines
       available).
     * IC50/90 calculation, compound toxicity included. Specific
       measurements available on request (determination of oncolytic
       potential, viral inactivation,  attachment, penetration,
       replication, cell to cell spread).
     * Hit sorting
     * Writing and transfer of final study report

   Assets:
     * Rapidity: high throughput format (up to 1000 compounds/day),
       classical turn-around time is a week (months for plaque assay/TCID
       studies).
     * Multi-parametric: each data point include normalized toxicity,
       impact on infection rate and viral DNA replication level
     * Precise: help determine the mechanism of action of a compound (MOA)

   Applications:
     * drug discovery in human and animal health
     * measure of oncolytic product or gene therapy product activity on
       specific cell lines
     * interaction of oncolytic or gene therapy product with existing
       treatment

     __________________________________________________________________

   NeoVirTech performs high resolution imaging in living cells of your
   specific construct to decipher its action. We have already developed
   custom ANCHOR^TM viruses or viral vectors for specific application such
   as antiviral discovery, gene transfer studies, viral based vaccine
   development, oncolytic virotherapies and other broad applications,
   depending on customer’s interest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Classical Worflow:
     * Viral vector collection and amplification
     * ANCHOR^TM tagging of the DNA of interest and validation using
       vector specific markers
     * Determination of  infection kinetics, replication and propagation
       of the tagged construct using high resolution live cell imaging,
       from 2D to 3D.
     * Imaging of the impact of a specific compound on the behavior of the
       construct.
     * Validated models can then shift to either the High content
       screening part of our services or to the licensing part.

   Assets:
     * High quality data are generated, tremendous asset in
       communication/marketing campaign
     * As viral DNA is autofluorescent, no fixation, no extraction and no
       reagents are required. We directly image effect of your product.

   Advances in immune suppression allows the grafting of life saving cells
   and organs between patients. Immune suppression unfortunately also
   promotes viral infections normally controlled by the immune system
   making the development of novel antivirals that work under immune
   suppression an imperative task. The underlying mechanisms causing
   reactivation or promoting viral replication are often related to
   dynamic changes in the chromatin status of the viral genome. Working
   with NeoVirtech gives us the unique opportunity to label viral genomes
   with the ANCHOR technology and study the dynamic behaviour of
   individual viral genomes in living cells under different environmental
   conditions. Understanding how viral genomes respond in living cells is
   key to understanding and developing novel drug concepts and mechanistic
   understanding of existing antivirals. Setting up the technology with
   NeoVirtech was simple, professional and driven by scientific
   understanding … the start of a great ongoing relationship!

   Viral diseases cause significant financial loss in animal production
   systems. Despite the importance of viral pathogens as primary and
   secondary etiologic agents in cattle, pigs and poultry, no antiviral
   products are commercially licensed for use in veterinary medicine.
   Collaboration with NeoVirTech give us unique opportunity to explore the
   potential of antiviral therapy in the veterinary virology domain. Among
   viral animal diseases, we are particularly interested in poxviruses
   induced diseases of rabbit and poultry (myxomatosis, fowlpox), and
   labelling of DNA viral genomes with the ANCHOR technology will allow us
   to rapidly screen available compounds for antiviral significative
   effects.
