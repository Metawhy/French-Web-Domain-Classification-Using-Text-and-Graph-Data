   The Semipalatinsk nuclear test site (SNTS) covers 18 500 km^2 in the
   north-east of Kazakhstan near the city of Semey, previously known as
   Semipalatinsk. In 1949-1989, the Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear
   tests there. In 1949-1962, 118 nuclear tests were conducted above
   ground and in the atmosphere, emitting radioactive contamination
   (release) into the soil and air. Some of these releases caused
   radioactive plumes that exposed people and territories adjacent to the
   site.

   The goal of the SEMI-NUC project is to assess the feasibility of
   establishing a long-term, prospective cohort to study the health
   effects of low and moderate radiation exposures that resulted from the
   testing of nuclear weapons at the SNTS. Coordinated by the
   International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the project brings
   together experts in epidemiology and dosimetry who have been involved
   in previous studies of residents exposed to radiation in the SNTS.

   The project is funded by European Commission Euratom FP7 grant No
   323310.
