Aims of the programme

   Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic which deals with the
   relationship between formal logical languages (e.g. first order logic,
   or variants such as continuous logic) and mathematical objects (e.g.
   groups, or Banach spaces). It analyses mathematical structures through
   the properties of the category of its definable sets. Significant early
   applications of model theory include Tarski's decidability results in
   the 1920s (algebraically closed fields, real closed fields), and in the
   1960s the well-known Ax-Kochen/Ershov results on the model theory of
   Henselian valued fields.

   These last few years have seen an extremely rapid development of the
   powerful tools introduced for stable structures in a much larger
   context, that of tame structures. Our main themes for this programme
   aim to develop both the internal model theory of tame structures and
   their recent applications.

   The programme will bring together researchers on the following topics:

   (i) Model theory and application to combinatorics. Additive
   combinatorics (approximate subgroups and variations); Around Szemerédi
   Regularity Lemma and Density Theorem; Pseudofinite structures (e.g.,
   ultraproducts of finite structures); Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory,
   applications, and NIP theories; Continuous model theory; Generalised
   stability theory and tame structures.
   (ii) Model theory of valued fields and applications. The prime focus is
   on the model theory of Henselian valued fields with the valuation
   topology, often with extra structure and under assumptions which ensure
   that definable sets can be understood. Motivic integration;
   Algebraically closed valued fields, imaginaries, and Berkovich spaces;
   Valued fields with additional structure; Transseries and surreal
   numbers; Definable groups.
   (iii) Applications of model theory in geometry, analysis and number
   theory. Study of fields with operators and their applications to
   concrete problems; Applications of the Pila-Wilkie counting theorem.

   The emphasis will be on the first two themes, where interactions and
   collaborations are still at an early stage. Theme (iii) is already well
   developed, and has connections with both themes (i) and (ii), mainly
   through concrete algebraic examples. While very present in the
   programme, it is less central.

   We intend to concentrate the activities of theme (i) (around
   Combinatorics) in the period 15 January - 9 February, and those of
   theme (ii) (around valued fields) in the period 12 February - 9 March,
   leading up to and including the second meeting. The third and final
   meeting will be general, including all three themes. However, we expect
   to have people from all themes of the programme at any point of time.

Structure of the trimester

   In addition to weekly seminars and courses, the trimester will have
   four meetings:

   2018. Introductory preschool of the trimester.

     Model theory and combinatorics, 29 January - 2 February 2018. IHP.

     Model theory of valued fields, 5 - 9 March 2018. IHP.

     Model theory and applications, 26 - 30 March 2018. IHP.
