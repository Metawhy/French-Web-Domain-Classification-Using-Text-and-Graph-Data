   Processing and Agro-Resources (UP 2018.C103)


   The research carried out in the two units that will be merging mainly
   concerns food and non-food applications of agro-resources.

   The PETALES team will focus on characterizing agro-resources during
   processing and look at the impact of processing on intestinal
   homeostasis following early exposure.

   The VAM²IN team will study the structure–function relationship of
   materials and bio-based products with a view to non-food uses.




   The scientific project
   About the unit

   The Processing and Agro-Resources Unit is under the aegis of
   UniLaSalle, an agricultural engineering school founded in January 2016
   following the merger between the Institut Polytechnique LaSalle in
   Beauvais and ESITPA in Rouen.

   The unit is composed of associate professors from the former EGEAL
   (Gene Expression and Epigenetic Regulation by Food Components) Unit in
   Beauvais and research area 2 of the former AGRI’TERR (Agroecology and
   Land Use Systems) Unit in Rouen, as well as associate professors who
   were not previously part of these former units (for example associate
   professors from Béthune University Institute of Technology).

   The program focuses on the processing and application of whole crops
   with a view to sustainable development, from research into their growth
   mechanisms to analysis of their properties and functions when they
   reach end use, whether this use is a food or non-food application. The
   unit comprises two teams:
     * The PETALES team: Processing for food uses and effects on health;
     * The VAM²IN team: Processing for non-food uses.

   Education
   PETALES team (food processing and effects on health)

   When agricultural raw materials are used in any agri-food process, the
   major stages in processing may alter initial molecular assemblies by
   potentially generating new structures/assemblies and/or new compounds
   that were not in the original product. All these structures/molecules
   travel through the digestive tract, with or without changes, where they
   may have an impact. To understand these health effects in connection
   with our scientific project, we have introduced a number of tools and
   methods designed to:

   1 – Characterize agro-resources during processing

   It is important to pay closer attention to the quality of the initial
   raw materials selected and also to better manage the processes used. We
   evaluate the effects of heat treatment on the food matrix by
   characterizing and quantifying the new compounds that are formed during
   this processing stage:(i) Characterizing the potential impact of other
   types of processing of the food matrix; (ii) Determining variability
   factors in the composition of unprocessed raw materials; (iii)
   Implementing new dimensions of characterization to identify changes in
   the structure/conformation of the biopolymers present.


   2 – Analyze how the processing of agro-resources affects intestinal
   homeostasis following early exposure

   The development and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis have a major
   impact on health, and the positive and negative effects of food
   consumption, whether or not that food has undergone processing, are a
   key focus of study for our team. We evaluate how assemblies and/or new
   compounds formed by processing affect the development and maintenance
   of intestinal homeostasis. The researchers use in vivo and in vitro
   models to shed light on biological effects and molecular and cellular
   mechanisms and to measure their potential impact.

   Our tasks include: (i) Evaluating the impact of heat treatment and/or
   other processing techniques on molecular assemblies/molecules and their
   technological, organoleptic, health and nutritional functions; (ii)
   Determining the origins of variability in raw materials and the role of
   this variability in the changes observed during processing; (iii)
   Identifying the conditions needed for these molecules to affect the
   behavior of the various cells in the gut region (viability testing,
   growth, differentiation, gene expression, expression of epigenetic
   markers on cultures and co-cultures of cells in vitro); (iv) Estimating
   the impact of these molecules on intestinal homeostasis (animal models,
   characterization of physiological and molecular responses to exposure
   to the molecules under study).
   VAM²IN team (developing innovative molecules and materials from
   agro-resources)

   Today’s producers, faced with a difficult economic and regulatory
   context, are constantly looking to develop innovative materials that
   are more environmentally and health friendly. The use of agricultural
   by-products as raw plant materials is a promising alternative solution
   to these challenges, since these products are renewable and produced in
   large quantities. The VAM²IN team aims to identify new applications for
   crops as part of an integrated approach to land use development. The
   researchers target potential non-food uses of agro-resources, including
   turning them into materials and producing molecules of interest for
   future applications, within innovative sectors that will boost the
   development of the bio-economy, based on the expertise of this new team
   and its partners.

   1 – Construction and functionalization of new bio-based materials

   The team’s research is geared towards improving our understanding of
   the assembly mechanisms of biopolymers extracted from agricultural
   resources and co-products that are involved in material development
   processes. The aim is to control the structure, functions and
   durability of materials by making the best use of the intrinsic
   characteristics of biopolymers and, if necessary, incorporating new
   technologies (extrusion, RMX, steam injection compression, ozonation,
   etc.) into processes for the development of assemblies that are
   specific to these bio-based materials. Interactions between components
   and interfaces are key to understanding these new assemblies
   (structure–property relationships).


   We particularly focus on: (i) the role of the composition and structure
   of agro-resources in the characteristics of agro-materials after
   implementation; (ii) how processing and the intrinsic properties of raw
   plant materials affect molecular assemblies and their functions
   (chemical and physical interactions, physical performance and
   preferential affinities). These experimental approaches will be
   combined with statistical modeling techniques.

   2 – Deconstruction of agro-resources for the production of bio-based
   materials

   The aim of this research is to analyze and improve characterization of
   the mechanisms underpinning the deconstruction of plant biomass
   fractions (native and/or processed polymer assemblies) with the aim of
   controlling and optimizing the production of energy and/or synthon-type
   molecules of interest (chemical intermediates for green chemistry
   reactions).

   The researchers will attempt to elucidate how interactions between the
   structural properties of lignocellulosic biomass are linked with its
   capacity to be deconstructed using sophisticated pretreatment
   technologies (physical and chemical, thermal, mechanical, etc.)
   involving few or no chemical reagents. Any pretreatment techniques used
   must be environmentally friendly.

   Research into agro-resource deconstruction may also involve other
   aspects, for example the biodegradability of new assemblies and
   applications of molecules obtained using biological degradation
   processes.

     * Ozone 2020 project (2016-2022)

   Although the efficiency of ozone has been demonstrated in a variety of
   industrial applications, it is still rarely used in the agro-industrial
   sector. But increasingly stringent health requirements mean that
   ongoing improvements to food preparation methods are needed. The FUI
   (French Joint Ministerial Fund) Ozone 2020 project aims to support
   these developments by anticipating and responding to key challenges in
   the areas of food quality and safety. The project involves a number of
   partners, drawing on the expertise of several academic and industry
   specialists (Actalia, Bonduelle, Etia, Suez Environnement and
   UniLaSalle). The aim is to develop and implement two applications to
   reduce the biological contamination of plant-based products. The
   project will initially target dried products and ready-to-eat raw
   vegetables.

     * VALOEQUIBOUE project (2018-2022)

   The VALOEQUIBOUE project – utilization of horse manure and residual
   wastewater treatment plant mud combined by anaerobic digestion –, is
   led by UniLaSalle, the Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC) and
   SIAAP-DDP and is part of the second phase of the MOCOPEE program
   (modeling, control and optimization of wastewater treatment processes)
   (2018-2022).

   The anaerobic digestion of horse manure combined with wastewater
   treatment plant mud is key to the utilization of these resources. This
   process, known as co-digestion, represents huge potential for biogas
   production and offers high added value in terms of energy, agronomy and
   costs. The project is divided into several tasks carried out as part of
   Arnaud Coutu’s PhD: i) pretreatment of horse manure using ozonation and
   other innovative techniques to improve anaerobic digestion; ii)
   biodegradation of horse manure by wet anaerobic digestion; iii)
   determining operating parameters (hydraulic retention time,
   temperature, agitation, applied load, single or sequential reactor,
   etc.); iv) co-digestion with wastewater treatment plant mud and
   potentially other resources.
