   I know 100 isn’t exactly a giant number of followers on Tumblr, but I
   just wanted to say “thank you”  for helping me get even this far. With
   that said, here’s what I’d like to offer:

   One FREE commission from myself, delivered in .PDF format for easy
   printing. Depending on what you want drawn, it’ll probably be either an
   8.5” x 11” or 11” x 17” piece. As far as content goes, the only
   restriction I have is that it can’t be hateful content (racist, sexist,
   etc). Outside of that, go wild!

   "How do I enter this lovely contest?" you may ask. Easy! Simply:
     * Reblog this post, and
     * Follow galactic-black​ on Tumblr

   You have until Friday, September 12 at 9PM EST to enter. At that time,
   I’ll choose a random reblog and check to make sure they’re a follower.
   If so, I’ll reach out immediately via Ask, and we’ll have a winner!

   Again, thanks so much for the support y’all have given, and I look
   forward to many more giveaways as we hit bigger milestones!

     The world is full of interesting, challenging and useful mental
     problems—why devote your precious time to solving fake ones [like
     brain games]?

     Why not use that time instead to learn Chinese, physics, computer
     programming, history, economics, calculus or millions of other
     engaging skills. Many of these have similar cognitive stresses that
     the brain games supposedly induce, plus the problem of transfer goes
     away since these subjects are actually useful…

     Why pick a brain game when you can train your mind to do something
     useful and interesting instead?

On your next flight, don't waste your life. Do something that matters.

   Southwest Airlines sent this email to me today:

   Make any time TV time.
   Watch free TV on your next flight.
   The only thing you have to lose is boredom.

   That’s a damned lie.

     “I’m Pastor Ryan Heller and I’d like to personally invite you to
     Edge Church this Easter.”

   This was on a mass mailer that was sent to my house. I wouldn’t exactly
   call that a personal invitation.

   Then it said to get “tickets for the service” I should go to their
   website. Ha.

Parent calls cops on teen for giving books away at a book giveaway

   Someone called the cops on a teenager for giving away free books.

   At—wait for it—a book giveaway event. […]

   Two weeks ago, parents in the Idaho school district of Meridian
   successfully campaigned to remove Alexie’s novel from its 10th-grade
   reading curriculum and additional reading lists.

   But the district’s local teens fought back, organizing a petition to
   have the book reinstated. In response, the local Boise bookseller
   Rediscovered Books crowdfunded a $3,400 campaign to buy copies of the
   book for each of the 350 students who signed the petition.

   That meant there were a lot of books to give away. Junior Mountain High
   School student Brady Kissel went to Kleiner Park in Meridian to
   distribute the books Wednesday evening. Kissel had arranged the
   giveaway with Rediscovered Books as part of a national book giveaway
   event called World Book Night.

   And then, of course, irate parents ruined it by literally calling the
   cops to the scene. Boise news station KBOI reported that even the cops
   were baffled about why they’d been asked to police a book giveaway.

   KBOI reported that police had been summoned by “someone concerned about
   teenagers picking up a copy of the book without having a parent’s
   permission.”

Телефонни разговори с дядо

   “България ми липсваше повече отпреди…
   - Дядо - питах го понякога по телефона, - какво ядеш?
   - Диня със сирене…
   - Дядо, какво пиеш?
   - Айрян.
   - Хубав ли е ?
   - Най-хубавият.
   - Дядо, какво виждаш - ей сега, точно в тоя миг?
   - Баира над къщата. Липите са побелели. Вятърът им е обърнал листата.
   Ще вали.
   Знаех, че нарочно ме дразни, че нарочно сипва сол в раните, но все така
   не спирах да разпитвам. Само за миг да можех да му взема очите, само за
   миг да можех да му открадна езика - щях да се натъпча с хляб и сирене,
   да пресуша шест кратунки с кладенчова вода, да се напълня с баири, с
   поля и реки.”
   – Мирослав Пенков,  “На изток от Запада”
   ***

   “I missed Bulgaria more than ever…
   - Grandpa,’ I would ask him occasionally on the phone, ‘what are you
   eating?
   - Watermelon with white cheese…
   - Grandpa, what are you drinking?
   - Kefir.
   - Is it nice?
   - The best.
   - Grandpa, what do you see right now, right at this moment?
   - The hill above the house. The linden trees have become white. The
   wind has turned their leaves around. It will rain.
   I knew he deliberately teased me, deliberately poured salt in my
   wounds, but still I kept asking. If only for a moment I could take his
   eyes, if only for a moment I could steal his tongue – I would stuff
   myself with bread and cheese, I would dry down six gourds with well
   water, I would fill myself up with hills, mountains and rivers. ”
   ― Miroslav Penkov,  “East of the West”
