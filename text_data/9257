Zendesk Neighbor Foundation


   The Zendesk Neighbor Foundation was founded on the belief that the best
   relationships are rooted in empathy. Empathy is the capacity to walk in
   someone else’s shoes, understand their point of view and hear their
   story. Empathy in business establishes trust, deepens relationships and
   inspires innovation.

   Our focus is addressing homelessness and poverty; and promoting
   technical literacy, diversity and gender equality in the cities where
   we live and work. Empathy helps us look at the complicated and nuanced
   issues surrounding homelessness and poverty and approach those issues
   humbly. It lends context and urgency to goals for equality.

   Empathy means offering more than financial support to those in need. It
   broadens our definition of “good neighbor.” Guided by empathy, we get
   to know the people in our communities, join them in their experience
   and work toward solutions side by side.
