Rail Nation – Full steam ahead

   Railway attraction – Millions of fans worldwide devote their spare time
   to the fascination and enjoyment of tracks, locomotives and routing.
   Popular board games, computer games and even TV series revolve around
   railways – however, until now, no contemporary online game has managed
   to fascinate its audience.

   In Rail Nation, all interested strategy gamers and railway fans are
   given the chance to start up their own railway company, manage
   transports on a daily basis and to team up with associations in order
   to finally become the victorious single player or group of players.
   Cities can only grow if they are adequately supplied with the goods and
   passengers they demand.

   Since being on the move constantly is key in the railway business, a
   dynamic territory map including 3D train models is at the centre of the
   game. It is crucial for every digital railway tycoon to increase their
   own personal prestige and wealth and also that of their association in
   direct competition with rival associations. The calculation of train
   routes and goods prices occur in real time. Efficient schedules for the
   transport of a total of 48 different goods have to planned and
   maintained. Growing profits will allow players to develop their train
   fleet consisting of 36 different steam, diesel and electric engines and
   48 different kinds of waggons.

   Over the course of the game, goods can be transported to an
   ever-growing number of cities and players can enter transport
   competitions and let their trains race against those of others.
   Exclusive licences allow for additional revenue. Targeted deliveries to
   cities can also have a lasting effect on their development.
   In the station area, you have to invest in infrastructure.

   Never neglect the infrastructure of your own train station. Through the
   option to form associations, Rail Nation emphasises cooperation between
   friends, fellow players and possibly even rivals. Together, for
   example, important workers can be signed on in the game. In total,
   thousands of different players are competing with and against each
   other on the server.

   With its easy-to-use controls and a comprehensive tutorial, Rail Nation
   allows for an smooth entry into the game, without compromising on
   advanced options for strategists. A game round is scheduled to last
   between 3 – 4 months. It consists of six consecutive railway eras
   followed by an endgame, in which all players compete with their grown
   railway companies against each other in the ultimate battle.
   Researching new engines and upgrades is crucial to success in the game.

   Rail Nation can be played for free in all common browsers. For just a
   couple of Dollars a month, premium users will be able to benefit from a
   number of different amenities, allowing them to make their engines even
   more efficient.

Game rules

   The game rules are an extension of the general terms and conditions. In
   the event of a ban, or simply for checking what is and isn’t allowed,
   the general terms and conditions should be read. Particularly here 8.

   Avoiding the game rules will be considered a violation and will be
   treated as such. All game rules also apply to players who are intending
   on deleting their account, or those who already have their account in
   the deletion phase.

   1. Account
     * 1.1. Every player is only allowed to possess and play one account
       per game world.
     * 1.2. The account holder is the person whose e-mail address is
       registered to the account. Support has the right to request the
       e-mail address as verification.
     * 1.3. It is a violation of the rules to share passwords and will be
       punished as such. Exception: multi-player accounts. These are only
       permitted if the players of the account don’t possess or play any
       other account in the same game world. Accounts that are played from
       the same PC are not allowed to have the same password.
     * 1.4. It is against the rules to attempt to gain access to another
       account unrightfully. Any login that is not carried out by the
       account holder will be seen as unrightful. Violations could lead to
       expulsion from the game. The team will never ask you for your
       password!
     * 1.5. An account must only be played for its own success and is not
       allowed to exist for the exclusive benefit of another account.
       Accounts that are exclusively used to provide other accounts an
       advantage (‘pushing’) are forbidden.
     * 1.6. Inactive Rail Nation accounts will not be deleted.

   2. Netiquette
     * 2.1. Insults, vilification or other questionable comments about
       other players, in any form or in any place in the game, will not be
       tolerated and will be punished.
     * 2.2. Using a different language, other than the relevant server
       language or English in IGMs (in-game messages), chat messages, in
       the world chat and in player profiles is not permitted. The server
       language is determined by the country flags on the server selection
       screen. Multiple languages can be server languages.
     * 2.3. We do not allow any links in chat, profile or game forums.
       Exempt are full URL (not shortened) links leading to domains of
       Travian Games GmbH and/or affiliated companies or trusted pages
       (Youtube, Wikipedia etc.). However, any links, even to trusted
       sites, that contain inappropriate content are not allowed
     * 2.4. Adverts of any kind, spam and chain mail are not allowed.
     * 2.5. The publishing of IGMs, e-mails or chat logs in the game or
       the forum without the permission of both parties (or all persons
       involved) is not permitted.
     * 2.6. It is forbidden to force a player to delete, give or share
       their account, or to demand that they share their password or
       violate a rule.
     * 2.7. The exploitation of bugs in the game is forbidden and will be
       punished. The same applies to the use of scripts, bots or other
       similar programs. The game must only be played with conventional
       browsers, rather than browsers modified for Rail Nation. Graphic
       packs are exempt from this.
     * 2.8. The imitation of official institutions in Rail Nation, or the
       use of unethical or politically incorrect names is forbidden and
       will be punished with immediate deletion.

   3. Administration
     * 3.1. The Support team and administrators have the right to decide
       the punishment for rule violations. Compensation will never be paid
       for the disadvantages incurred in the duration of a ban, this
       includes lost harvests, lost competitions or other losses. The
       player has no claim to the recompense or replacement of the lost
       time of Premium functions (e.g. Plus Account, Researcher, Mechanic)
       during a ban. There will be no special treatment for paying players
       of Rail Nation regarding the game rules, neither in the duration of
       a ban, nor in deciding the punishment.
     * 3.2. In the event of rule violations your only port of call is the
       support team for your gameworld. Players can send their argument,
       explaining their circumstances, to support by IGM or using the help
       contact form. Players can also contact admin@rail-nation.com should
       they have good reason to question the decision of Support.
     * 3.3. The Rail Nation team reserves the right to change the game
       rules at any time.
     * 3.4. If a single article in the game rules becomes invalid, only
       the validity of that particular article is effected, rather than
       the whole set of rules. Invalid articles will be changed by the
       administrators as soon as possible.
