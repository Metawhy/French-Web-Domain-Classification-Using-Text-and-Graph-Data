Tumble In ~ Marfa, Texas ^1

   RV Parks/Campgrounds • Tags: Adventures: Texas, Marfa, Tumble In

   TX Marfa_3934

   I am innately drawn to obscure out-of-the-way small towns in our
   country. Just add in one Airstream, two days travel, a  yellow lab and
   a wanderlust for adventure and you’ll end up in the land of “Quirky” ~
   better known as Marfa, TX. This post, however, is only about the
   accommodations found in Marfa ~ the Tumble In RV Park. I’ll be sharing
   stories about the town of Marfa and unique finds in my next post. When
   you hear Marfa is in the middle of nowhere, that is correct. And the
   Tumble In makes you feel right at home in the middle of nowhere! I
   loved staying here. Quirky, plain, no frills ~ yes but, there is
   something about it that grounds you. Waking up to hear the train
   passing by (and I do mean passing right by, check out the photo below
   of how close it really is), watching the tumbleweed float by like a
   silent passerbyer and the Texas winds that speak to you while blowing
   past your cheek.

   Drive on in to the Tumble In….

   Self check-in at the office which is an orange and white 1962 Mobile
   Scout (canned ham). Luv this!

   Did I mention the “train”?

   TX Marfa_7180

   The facilities ~new, modern and really cool. Not your average RV Park
   so have an open mind!

   View from my office on a blustery Marfa day (and another train!!). Otis
   was very circumspect of the “stickers” which are everywhere in Texas.
   Not so great for the pups paws.

Yellowstone National Park ^3

   Destinations • Tags: Adventures: Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park

   Yellowstone National Park is truly a magical place. The park was
   established in 1872 as our nation’s first national park. Consisting of
   3,472 square miles and situated on 2,221,766 acres, Yellowstone is
   located in Wyoming (96%), Montana (3%) and Idaho (1%). Yellowstone has
   the worlds largest collection of geysers with approximately 300 and
   over 10,000 thermal features.

   We drove about 100 miles per day in search of wildlife and flora. I
   hope you enjoy this short post of the written word to enjoy the beauty
   that I have desperately tried to capture with my lens. Feel free to ask
   me any questions about what you see or would like to learn about a trip
   to Yellowstone. If you haven’t been ~ it’s a must experience “Bucket
   List” destination.

   Bison are plentiful in Yellowstone and can be viewed throughout the
   park especially in the Hayden Valley and Lamar Valley.

   Grizzly Boar I followed for a couple of hours along the Yellowstone
   River near Steamboat Point. This image was taken at dusk and there was
   no light to speak of. Sometimes I find it’s not about a photograph,.
   Sometimes you just have to soak in the experience and that is what I
   did while viewing this amazing mammal.

Welcome to Yellowstone National Park & Fishing Bridge RV Park ^8

   RV Parks/Campgrounds • Tags: Adventures: Wyoming, Fishing Bridge RV
   Park, Yellowstone National Park

   My mother always said, the older you get the faster times goes. Well
   Mom, you were right. I can’t believe how much time has passed since my
   last post. My sincerest apologies are in order for being remiss in
   sharing my travels and adventures since the summer. Lots of
   great stories and images to share. So, here goes. I spent a week in
   Yellowstone followed by a glorious month in Jackson Hole at the end of
   August till the end of September. I”ll be posting about Jackson Hole
   soon, promise!!

   We decided to make the trip from Denver to Yellowstone in one day. It’s
   a long haul especially while towing and traveling with a doggie
   companion. But, Otis is quite the traveler. No complaints from him.
   After all, we were “going” somewhere and that is all he cares about.

   With construction in several locations in Wyoming which killed our
   time, it took us 12 hours to finally get to Fishing Bridge RV Park in
   Yellowstone. But, along the way somewhere between Rawlins and Dubois,
   Wyoming I pulled over to admire the sky. Of course, also had to drag
   the ‘ol camera out and snap just a few shots.

   WY Drive_8599 WY Drive_8552 WY Drive_8535

   Outside of Dubois, Wyoming I grabbed these shots of my Big “B”
   (Beatrice) and the vast Wyoming landscape and sky.

   WY Drive_8647 WY Drive_8636

   We drove through Grand Teton National Park via Moran Junction into
   Yellowstone National Park and stopped for some quick shots at the
   entrance and again at the Yellowstone Lake.

   WY Yellowstone_8670

   WY Yellowstone_8673

   Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest megafauna wildlife
   habitat in the lower 48’s. There are approximately 60 species of
   mammals in the park. As we were crossing the actual Fishing Bridge I
   was ebullient to share the road with a herd of Bison.

   WY Yellowstone_8696 WY Yellowstone_8719 WY Yellowstone_8744 WY

   Fishing Bridge RV Park ~ Yellowstone National Park. This was our second
   stay at Fishing Bridge and I would highly recommend it if you prefer
   full-hook ups, clean showers, laundry and other amenities. The sites
   are quite tight but, once you’re in, you’ll find yourself surrounded
   by luscious flora including lodgepole pines. It’s über important to
   follow the guidelines of the campground due to Grizzly Bears in the
   area and in the campground. There were Grizz in Loop A during our visit
   and herds of Bison would stroll through the campground daily. I loved
   our site #D-138 as it was an end spot in the middle of the loop. I was
   also very impressed that Yellowstone abides by strict recycling
   standards making it super easy for everyone to do their part and
   partake in recycling while camping.

   Fishing Bridge offers the convenience of a General Store which has a
   grocery store and a diner. Auto repair, gas and propane are also
   provided all within walking distance from the campground.

   Stellar sunrise at the Fishing Bridge

   Yours truly, Otis and my Big “B” settling in after a long 12 hour
   journey for a week of exploring the park and some well deserved R&R.
   After all, there is no cell service, internet or television at Fishing
   Bridge. I got a bit of cell service near the Yellowstone Lake, Mammoth
   Hot Springs and Old Faithful. So, be prepared to let go of it all and
   just enjoy the beauty that the park has to offer. What a gift this and
   all National Parks are to us all.

Downtown Austin ^2

   Destinations • Tags: Adventures: Texas, Austin

   Since posting yesterday about SoCo in Austin, Texas ~ thought it
   appropriate to finish up my Texas trip with a short post about downtown
   Austin. Austin is the capital city of Texas. It’s also the 11th most
   populous city in the US. It’s vibrant downtown scene is comprised
   of amazing restaurants and music venues all over town.  Austin is the
   annual host of South by Southwest (SXSW) one of the largest music
   festivals in the country. Now you can see how Austin got its name “Live
   Music Capital of the World”. You can’t get bored in Austin, there is
   always a concert, festival, art show and so much more to see, hear and
   do. I really dig this city.

   State Capitol of Texas ~ second largest state capital in the US behind
   Phoenix. Located just 4 blocks south of the University of Texas, the
   building is surrounded by 17 monuments on 22 gorgeous acres. Well worth
   a visit.

   TX Downtown_2424 TX Downtown_2410 TX Downtown_2394 TX Downtown_2386 TX

   The University of Texas at Austin ~ founded in 1883 and now has over
   50,000 undergraduate and graduate students. “U.T.” ~ home of the
   Longhorns!

   TX U of TX_2416

   Whole Foods Market ~ flagship store for the past 30 years. Largest
   Whole Foods at 80,000 sq ft. This store is unbelievable and we shop
   here almost daily when we’re in Austin. Shopping experience not to miss
   while visiting this hip town.

   TX Downtown_2436

   Zilker Metropolitan Park is located off Barton Springs Road (Pecan
   Grove RV Park is also on Barton Springs Rd!!) with 350 gorgeous acres.
   It’s a quick walk from Pecan Grove and around the corner from downtown
   Austin. We ran Otis at Zilker twice a day and I ran the miles of trails
   that are available for all to enjoy. You have to visit Zilker Park when
   you’re in Austin. It’s a peaceful park to hang out and do just about
   anything. I can’t wait to return and will be spending each day at
   Zilker.

   TX Zilker_2130 TX Zilker_2149 TX Otis_2358 TX Otis_2332

   We decided we didn’t much care for the laundry facility at Pecan Grove
   RV Park so we decided to hightail it to SpinCycle Coin Laundry “Keeping
   Austin Clean”. We got the job done!! One of the less glamorous tasks of
   RV’ing!

   TX Laundry_1744 TX Laundry_1742 TX Laundry_1738 TX Laundry_1737

   Our camp site at Pecan Grove RV Park in downtown Austin. We really
   enjoyed our stay at Pecan Grove and you can see more photos and read
   about it in my previous blog post!
