1965-71 – G.E. Hardiman I Exoskeleton – Ralph Mosher (American)

   One of the few photographs we see of Hardiman I.  I’d have a smile like
   that on my face too if I had one of these.

   Hardiman is a name derived somehow, from “Human Augmentation Research
   and Development Investigation.” and Man from MANipulator.  Sometimes
   written as HardiMan, Hardi-Man, Hardi Man, Hardiman I.  Said to also be
   officially called the “Powered Exo-skeleton.”

   Note: some reports suggest that only one arm of Hardiman’s was built.
   The above photo usually accompanies that comment, but it is incorrect.
   A complete Hardiman was built with both arms, but the comment refers to
   the earlier tests  of just the single, upper manipulator. Later, even
   when the full machine was built,  one side was made static, and the
   other side was capable  moving.

   The Hardiman program from 1965-1971

   The Hardiman stated in November 1965. The early phases were on human
   factors and kinematic concepts, which were completed in 1966. The
   results of this required changes, where the original concept was for a
   single master-slave system, now to be split in two, the upper arms, and
   the lower legs.

   By the end of 1967, the slave prototype had been built following
   load-bearing joint tests.

   There were technological problems with the hydromechanical servos,
   mainly around their stability. An interim study was put together and
   concluded by April 1968. The solution was to go to electrohydraulic
   servos.

   Although the plan was to build the legs first, this setback meant that
   the ONR directed the program to complete the arm system. By the end of
   1969, the single arm tests were completed.

   The leg and girdle systems were completed late 1970, but was not able
   to balance or walk without support.  Major kinematic problems were
   arising and could not be overcome within the program’s timeframe. The
   approach was taken to fasten the master leg to the slave at the girdle.
   This change the operating mode from “operator walk” to “operator ride”.

   Within these constraints and the assistance of a supporting tether it
   was possible to demonstrate a limited ambulatory capability with the
   leg system. A movie was made of this {RH:where is it now?].

1915 – The Radium Destroyer – Hugo Gernsback (American)

   February 28th, 2016 by cyberne1

   warfare-future-1915-radium-destroyer-x640

   November, 1915
   THE ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER by Hugo Gernsback.
   Front cover -"THE RADIUM DESTROYER" from a painting by Thomas H. Wrenn.
   (typo- actually Thomas N. Wrenn)
   Warfare of the Future
   The Radium Destroyer
   THE European War has clearly demonstrated what a tremendous part modern
   science plays in the offense as well as in the defense of the
   contending armies. It has often been said during the past twelve months
   that this is not a war so much of men as of machines. Nothing could be
   truer. In fact, it might be said that this is a war of infernal
   machines against more diabolical machines.
   It has been stated editorially in this journal that there will be war
   always, or at least till we arrive at a period when some scientific
   genius (or shall be call him devil?) invents a machine which at one
   stroke is capable of annihilating one or several army corps. When that
   time arrives, soldiers, no matter how courageous, will think a long
   time before they will offer themselves to be slaughtered by the hundred
   thousand.
   In the meantime, probably for many generations to come, the war
   death-dance will go on without any doubt whatsoever. Humanity simply
   has not advanced to such a state where disarmament is possible. Our
   real civilization only dates back less than 100 years, and as human
   progress is extremely slow, it may take a thousand years and more
   before humans will learn how to trust each other implicitly. As long as
   we require policemen and jails to keep us out of mischief, we are not
   able to take care of ourselves and we cannot call ourselves
   emancipated—we are still held in bondage by the brute in ourselves,
   which threatens to break out at any opportune moment, as is witnessed
   in the present war.
   Therefore, the pacificists, particularly those in our country who think
   that this is the "last war" and who go around shouting peace at any
   price, are not only a sorry lot, but they are cheerfully oblivious of
   the teachings of history as well as of human evolution.
   These good people would shout murder if you dared suggest to them to
   dismiss at once all policemen and patrolmen of their home town, but
   they would trust a strange nation implicitly from making war on this
   country, simply because that nation pledged itself on a piece of paper
   not to make war
   If the present war is ghastly with its poison shells, its deadly
   chlorine gas, its bomb-throwing aeroplanes, its fire-spraying guns, its
   murderous machine guns, etc., what can we expect of the wars of the
   future?
   What will happen when the scientists of a hundred years hence begin
   making war on each other?
   Suppose that by that time our scientists have solved the puzzle of the
   atom and have succeeded in liberating its prodigous forces. Imagine
   that at that time one atom can be disintegrated at will, instantly into
   another, what will happen? The results will simply be overwhelmingly
   astounding and almost incomprehensible to our present minds.
   It has been calculated that if we could liberate the latent energy at
   present locked up in a copper one cent piece we would be enabled to
   propel a train with 50 freight cars over a distance of 600 miles!
   Now, then, bearing this in mind, let us imagine that 100 years hence
   some scientist invents a means to unlock atomic forces, and how to
   control them. We can see him stepping to the throne of his future War
   Lord (if such still exist then), addressing him in this fashion: "My
   Lord, with the means of my invention the world is yours; will you make
   yourself the first Master of this Planet?"
   The War Lord promptly asks for a secret demonstration of the new
   "Atomic Gun," and what he sees intoxicates his imagination to such a
   degree that he decides to make war on the entire world as soon as his
   generals have assured him that enough atomic guns have been
   manufactured to make success certain. And one beautiful spring morning
   our War Lord finds a perfectly logical pretext to make war on a few
   nations, and the latest war dance is on.
   Within a few hours the first atomic gun. popularly known as the "Radium
   Destroyer, has crossed the enemy's frontier.
   The Radium Destroyer is mounted on fast moving auto trucks and is
   controlled entirely by Radio energy. No man is within a mile of the
   Destroyer—it is too dangerous to be near it when in action. A young
   lieutenant with phones clapped over his head and who follows the
   Destroyer in the "Control Auto," and who gets his own orders from the
   General Staff by Wireless, guides each and every motion of the distant
   Radium Destroyer simply by moving certain keys and switches in front of
   him.
   Soon his Destroyer has arrived in front of the enemy's first line of
   concreted steel trenches, protecting the land behind them. In front of
   the trenches the ground has been purposely cut up to impede the
   progress of ordinary vehicles. The General Staff, of course, knew this,
   and built the Destroyer accordingly. Our friend the lieutenant stops
   the Destroyer's truck and moves a lever. Immediately the Destroyer hops
   from the truck and begins to jump with amazing speed over the cutup
   ground, in grasshopper fashion. A few hundred feet from the
   well-concealed concrete trenches the Destroyer is made to halt. Our
   lieutenant moves a few switches, turns a knob and presses a key—then
   lot the inferno begins.
   A solid green "Radium-K" emanation ray bursts from the top of the
   Destroyer and hits the concreted steel trench. Our front cover gives
   but a faint idea of what happens. The Radium-K emanation has the
   property of setting off spontaneously the dormant energy of the Atom of
   any element it encounters except lead. So when the ray hits the trench
   it went up in dust, concrete, steel, men and guns behind it,
   everything. After spraying the trench lengthwise for a few minutes it
   is gone completely. Only a dense cloud of vapor hanging in the air
   remains.
   The fleet of Radium Destroyers now enters through the gap, destroying
   everything in their path. No gun can hit the Radium Destroyer for ere
   the gun can get the proper range, the Radium-K Ray has hit the gun or
   the ground below it and has sent it up in vapor, including the men
   behind it. As a demonstration, the Commanding General asks that the
   first town encountered, a city of 300,000 souls, be vacated within
   three hours. The terrorized inhabitants are forced to comply with the
   request, whereupon a dozen Destroyers line up on the hills and spray
   the unlucky city with their fearful rays. Within five minutes the
   entire city, houses, churches, bridges, parks and everything else have
   gone up in a titanic Vapor cloud; only a vast crater in the ground
   where the thriving city one stood remains.
   After this demonstration the enemy sues for peace; resistance would be
   folly. The country is conquered. Within a fort night the War Lord has
   conquered the entire world and has proclaimed himself as the First
   Planet Emperor.
   What happens afterwards when the secret of the Radium Destroyer is
   discovered by the War Lord's enemies is another chapter, so we will
   desist !
   The above may read very fantastical and extremely fanciful. It is,
   however, not only very possible but highly probable. Modern Science
   knows not the word Impossible.

1910 – The Electric Vampire – F. H. Power (British)

   January 29th, 2016 by cyberne1

   electric-vampire-cover-x640

   The Electric Vampire
   By F. H. Power
   Illustrated by Philip Baynes
   (This short story appeared in The London Magazine of October 1910 with
   the accompanying Editor's note: 'The following short story, though of
   course but a figment of the imagination, is yet founded on fact. Over
   seventy years ago (in 1836, to be precise), a Mr Crosse astonished the
   British Association by reading a paper on electro-crystalisation, in
   which he described how he obtained living electrical insects, called
   acari, by artificial means — namely, by a voltaic battery, certain
   acids, and red oxide of iron. His experiments were closely watched by
   the leading scientists of the day, but Crosse himself gave them up,
   owing to the excited attitude of a section of the public, who assailed
   him with much bitterness for carrying out experiments which they
   considered it a "crime" to make.')

   electric-vampire-inside-x640

   I was at breakfast when the note reached me. 'My dear Charles,' it ran
   — 'I shall be glad if you can come round to my place tonight, as I have
   something to show you, which I think will interest you. I have also
   asked Vane.'
   It did not take a moment for me to make up my mind to go. Dr Vane and I
   often spent an evening at George Vickers's house. We were bachelors,
   and as we were all fond of things scientific, the time passed very
   pleasantly — so pleasantly that very often it was two or three o'clock
   in the morning before he saw us off his premises.
   During the day I found myself speculating as to what our friend
   intended to show us. I recalled some of the weird and fascinating
   electrical experiments he had performed in his laboratory. 'I bet it's
   another experiment with electricity,' I said to myself, but I was only
   partly correct.
   I arrived at the house about six o'clock, and found Vane had already
   arrived, and, as usual, had taken the easiest armchair in which to rest
   his lean body. Our host, with his ruddy, smiling face, stood with his
   back to the fireplace.
   'I'm glad you have come, Charlie,' he said. You will be able to relieve
   me from that living mark of interrogation.' And he nodded towards the
   doctor, who sat twirling an imaginary moustache.
   'Well, why can't he indicate what he has dragged us round here for?'
   the doctor asked plaintively. 'And fancy having as an excuse that he
   doesn't want to spoil my appetite for dinner!'
   'Eh, what?' I ejaculated.
   'Oh, now you are going to start. For goodness' sake find something else
   to talk about until we have had something to eat,' said Vickers, and he
   suggested aeroplanes.
   We let him have his own way, and very soon after sat down to dinner.
   Our conversation during the meal would have been dry to many, but it
   was after our own hearts, and never flagged for a moment. The doctor's
   speciality was biology. My hobby is chemistry, and it was through an
   explosion which nearly blinded me that I first made his acquaintance,
   and subsequently introduced him to George Vickers.
   At last George leaned back in his chair, and, lighting a cigar, said:
   'You fellows, of course, want to know what on earth I am keeping up my
   sleeve. Before I show you, I want you to listen to this short extract
   from a series of lectures given by a man named Noad, and published in
   1844.'
   He fetched the book, and read:
   "It was in the course of his experiments in electro-crystalisation that
   that extraordinary insect about which so much public curiosity has been
   expended, was first noticed by Mr Crosse." '
   Here Vickers looked up from the volume, and remarked:
   'Mr Crosse I might say, was a gentleman who stood foremost as one of
   the individuals in this country who have distinguished themselves by
   their researches in atmospheric electricity.'
   He turned to the book again:
   "In justice to this talented individual, who was most shamefully and
   absurdly assailed by some ignorant people on account of this insect,
   and who underwent much calumny and misrepresentation in consequence of
   experiments 'which in this nineteenth century it seems a crime to have
   made,' I shall give a detailed account of that experiment in which the
   Acarus first made its appearance.
   'Here follows,' said George, a minute description of the apparatus
   Crosse used. Briefly a basin containing practically a saturated
   solution of soluble silica is placed in a funnel, and a piece of
   flannel hangs over the side of the basin and acts as a syphon. The
   liquid falls in drops on a piece of porous red oxide of iron from
   Vesuvius, kept constantly electrified by a voltaic battery.'
   Again he turned to the book and read:
   ' "On the fourteenth day from the commencement of the experiment, Mr
   Crosse observed through a lens a few small whitish excrescences or
   nipples projecting from about the middle of the electrified iron, and
   nearly under the dropping of the fluid above. On the eighteenth day
   these projections enlarged, and seven or eight filaments, each of them
   longer than the excrescence from which it grew, made their appearance
   on each of the nipples. On the twenty-second day, these appearances
   were more elevated and distinct; and on the twenty-sixth day each
   figure assumed the form of a perfect insect standing erect on a few
   bristles which formed its tail. Till this period Mr Crosse had no
   notion that these appearances were any other than an incipient mineral
   formation, but it was not until the twenty-eighth day, when he plainly
   perceived these little creatures move their legs, that he felt any
   surprise. In a few days they separated themselves from the stone, and
   moved about at pleasure. They appeared to feed by suction." … Mr Crosse
   adds: "I have never ventured an opinion as to the cause of their birth;
   and for a very good reason — I was unable to form one." '
   Vickers shut the book up.
   'There's a lot more about it, but I think I have read all that is
   necessary. If either of you would like some more information on those
   early experiments, you will find it in the "Transactions of the
   Electrical Society".'
   There was silence whilst we puffed at our cigars. At length, Dr Vane
   said:
   'I was under the impression that subsequent experimentalists were not
   so successful as Mr Crosse ?' Vickers smiled enigmatically.
   'If you will just come this way, I fancy I shall be able to prove to
   you that at least one other experimentalist has been fairly
   successful.' And beckoned us to follow him.
   I had often been in his laboratory, but to my surprise he led us to a
   room at the top of the house, and, as he inserted the key, drew our
   attention to the Yale lock.
   'I rely on you chaps to keep to yourselves what I am going to show you,
   because I am preparing a paper on this experiment, and I want to
   surprise 'em,' he said, and pushed the door open.
   Dr Vane, with an eager look on his face, entered boldly. I followed
   close behind, and I remembered wondering why George, usually so
   unemotional, appeared to be in a state of suppressed excitement.

   electric_vampir-1910-x640
   And then I saw what it was. May I, a man, be forgiven if I trembled
   from head to foot!
   On a low plain wood table was a sheet of some metal about four feet
   square. From a cistern fixed above, and pierced by many minute holes,
   some liquid dropped on the slab incessantly. But these things I barely
   noticed, for my attention was riveted to the centre of that slab, on
   which sprawled a creature which I can only liken to an immense spider,
   its length being about two feet.
   Two legs appeared from behind each side of the head, and four longer
   ones — they must have been nearly as long as the body — at the back.
   Projecting from its head, where you would expect to find the mouth, was
   a trunk-like object which went in and out like the trunk of a fly. All
   over the body about an inch apart long filaments stood out. Its colour
   was drab, and it was apparently covered with slime. Its eyes were like
   the eyes of an owl, and never blinked.
   We stared at the fearsome object in dead silence.
   Vickers was the first to speak.
   'Pretty, isn't it?' he said, with a laugh, but the laugh seemed
   strangely out of place.
   I glanced at the doctor. His hands were clenched, and his eyes so wide
   open that the whites could be seen all round.
   'My God, George, what is that thing?' he whispered.
   'That, my dear doctor, is the result of years of experimenting. It
   first became visible to the naked eye five years ago today, but it does
   not appear to have grown during the last six months. It vindicates
   Crosse absolutely. Don't you think it is superb ?'
   'Superb? Oh, yes, it's superb!' said the doctor. He kept muttering to
   himself as he walked round the table, glaring at the thing on it, but
   from the few words I caught he was not calling it superb or anything
   like it.
   At last his love of biology overcame his repugnance.
   'I should like to feel one of those filaments,' he said, and stretched
   out his hand.
   Like a flash of lightning Vickers seized his wrist, and his face was
   the colour of chalk. Dr Vane looked astonished and hurt.
   'I am sorry, doctor, but I forgot to tell you it can give a terrific
   electric shock,' he said apologetically.
   Vane looked somewhat scared, but his interest was plainly increased.
   'Then it is some sort of relation to the Gymnotus, or electric eel of
   Venezuela?' he asked.
   'Or the Torpedo of the Mediterranean,' I suggested. Vickers shrugged
   his shoulders.
   'I only know that poor old Tippoo' — a splendid collie and great
   favourite of us all — 'happened to accompany me to this room yesterday,
   and poked his nose a bit too near, when he suddenly toppled over dead
   as a doornail. He was horribly burnt down one side.'
   Our friend spoke quietly, but it was easy to see he was deeply affected
   as he related the tragedy.
   'That must have startled you,' I said.
   'Well, no, I cannot say it was a surprise. I received a very nasty
   shock when it was quite small — perhaps I was not handling it as
   carefully as I might have. But' — here he turned to that monstrous
   creature, and actually passed his hand down one of its hairy legs — '
   but you know who feeds you, don't you, my beauty ?'
   The thing evidently did know, for that trunk-like object went in and
   out rapidly. And I might say here that was the only movement we noticed
   in it that evening.
   The startled look on our faces seemed to amuse Vickers. 'It's all
   right; it knows me. I have watched it grow day by day, and — '
   Here the doctor cut in with a question.
   'What do you feed the brute on?' he asked.
   Vickers hesitated a moment, and looked at us. Then he walked to the
   other side of the room, and opened a box which had airholes pierced in
   it.
   'The trunk,' he explained, 'is fitted with two small pointed teeth at
   the end, and the blood of the victim is gradually sucked out.' He
   anticipated our next question. 'No. It does not kill it first,' he
   said, and shut the lid.
   The box contained live mice.
   It was exactly ten days later that I was sitting with Vane in his study
   over a game of chess. At least, we were supposed to be playing chess.
   As a matter of fact, the doctor was again telling me what he thought of
   our friend's experiment, and the game had languished.
   'I tell you it's the greatest discovery ever made — the greatest!' And
   his fist thumped the table, making the pieces on the board dance again.
   His eyes shone with excitement, but this died away as his thoughts
   travelled in a different channel. 'But of all the ugly things God every
   created —'
   He stopped abruptly.
   'Do you know,' he continued presently, 'that Vickers's interesting pet
   belongs to the family of mites — ticks, as they are popularly called —
   notwithstanding its extraordinary size? All these creatures are
   furnished with suckers through which they can draw the juices of the
   animals on which they are parasitic, and in tropical countries — well,
   I will just say they are considerably more than annoying, and leave the
   rest to your imagination. They are small and flat when they first
   settle themselves on their victim, but they gradually swell and redden,
   until at last, when they are fully gorged, they are as large as
   broad-beans, and as easily crushed as ripe gooseberries.
   'It seems to me from its mode of formation that George has discovered
   the link between the inorganic world and the world of life — the link
   which is indispensable to a complete scheme of evolution; but the great
   objection to this idea is the creature's obvious complexity —'
   My further remarks were interrupted by a knock at the door, and the
   doctor's maid Emily entered.
   'Mr Vickers's housekeeper would like to speak to you, sir.'
   I heard Vane's 'Ah!' although it was said very softly. I remember my
   heart was beating at a ridiculous rate, and I tried hard to calm myself
   as I reflected that probably the old lady had come about her 'screws,'
   as she called her rheumatism, and which I knew had been troubling her
   more than usual.
   But Dr Vane went down the two flights of stairs to his surgery two
   steps at a time. At the door he turned round and simply nodded to me,
   and we entered together.
   Mrs Jones, Vickers's housekeeper, was waiting, with her veil pushed up
   until it looked like a black bandage across her forehead.
   'Is it Mr Vickers?' Vane asked abruptly.
   Mrs Jones never spoke quickly, and she did not intend to be hurried
   that day. Her reply came slowly, so deliberately that I thought my
   supply of patience would ebb away long before that simple question was
   answered.
   ' Well, sir, I don't know as there is anything the matter with Mr
   Vickers, but he ain't had a bite since one o'clock yesterday, and yet I
   feel certain as he is in the house. He went upstairs — '
   I think Mrs Jones had reason to look astonished, for Dr Vane, noted for
   his precise ways and highly professional manner, dashed to the
   house-telephone and shouted into the mouthpiece : Tell John to bring
   the car round at once ! You understand? He is not to delay one moment!'
   Then he turned to the housekeeper, who stood with her mouth half open,
   and said rapidly: 'You will come with us, and give us further
   particulars on the road.'
   What had happened? I dreaded to think of what that upstairs room would
   reveal to us. The doctor and I looked at each other. Then he placed his
   hand on my arm.
   'Charlie,' he whispered, 'you can depend on it George has got foul of
   that monster. I have felt something would happen, ever since he showed
   it to us, and it looks very much as if that something has happened.'
   'I pray God we shall not be too late!' I said fervently, but I thought
   of that Thing, with the never-winking eyes, and shuddered.
   Have you a revolver?' I asked.
   He nodded, and left the surgery.
   A few moments later the motor arrived. We bundled Mrs Jones in; and as
   Vane gave the chauffeur the address, he added: ' Drive like hell!' I
   shall not forget that ride in a hurry, and I am quite sure Mrs Jones
   won't. We plied her with questions, but her replies were so incoherent
   we soon gave it up. She sat with bulging eyes, one hand clutching the
   side of the car, the other my coat, and every time it bumped over an
   obstacle she shrieked. More than once I bawled into her ear: 'It's all
   right!' but I might have saved my breath, for she made no sort of
   variation on her terror-stricken cry : 'Stop it! Stop it!'
   A scared-looking maid let us in. We brushed past her, and went straight
   upstairs. Arriving at the door of that room, we stopped and listened,
   but could detect not the slightest sound. We tried the door — it was
   locked. So, after all that tearing hurry we were met by a well-built
   door, and Vickers had the key. We looked at each other in despair, but
   with Dr Vane it lasted but a moment, and was succeeded by a look of
   grim determination.
   'He is in there, and we have got to get to him,' he said decisively.
   'I'll fetch a locksmith: I think that will turn out to be the quickest
   way out of the difficulty,' I said, and was on the point of moving off
   when the doctor whispered excitedly: 'Wait! Listen! He is speaking!'
   I tiptoed back to the door, and listened with loudly beating heart, but
   hardly breathing: there was silence, a long silence, then I heard a
   voice, but what it said I could not distinguish. It seemed to come from
   afar off, like a voice on a telephone that had been badly connected up.
   Vane shook his head.
   'Speak up, old man! We can't hear you!' he shouted.
   Again we listened, and this time we could just make out the words … key
   … false … bottom … desk,' then all was quiet again.
   'Which drawer, and how do you open it ?' the doctor asked loudly. But
   not another sound came from the room, although he repeated the question
   twice.
   Vane turned to me. 'That's a piece of luck. I wonder why he had two
   keys made? Well, we have got to find that duplicate, quick,' he said.
   We rapidly made our way to Vickers's study, where we knew there was a
   roller-top desk. We thanked Heaven when we found the door open, and
   also the desk. It was a beautiful piece of furniture, and the top was
   rolled back, showing the row of pigeon-holes and small drawers. Tucked
   in one of the pigeon-holes was a bunch of keys.
   'Now, where the dickens is the drawer with the false bottom?' said
   Vane, and he hurriedly tried to find the keys which fitted the drawers.
   Now, investigations of this sort cannot be hurried, and, swearing
   softly, he demonstrated this fact completely. The swearing grew louder
   and louder, till, for a moment, I lost sight of the object of the
   search in amazement at the extent of his vocabulary.
   I relieved him of the bunch when he had opened half the drawers.
   Eventually we unlocked the lot, but although we quickly took a large
   number of measurements, we could not find the slightest indication of a
   false bottom to any of them.
   Our nerves were in a high state of tension before we entered the study;
   by this time, mine were in a deplorable condition. The doctor's face
   was lined with anxiety.
   Silently he handed me a poker, and from the wall took down an old Malay
   kris, which did duty for an ornament.
   'You take the right side of the desk; I'll take the other,' I said.
   We found the precious key, but the desk —
   Again we were at the door upstairs, and, although I turned the lock, I
   dreaded pushing it open. The whole business was so uncanny. Was that
   horrible creature prowling about the room ready to rush at us the
   moment we entered? How should we find Vickers?
   I glanced at Vane. His jaw was set, and he had taken the revolver out
   of his pocket. The only sounds we could hear were some carts rumbling
   along the roadway, and the whistling from a train a long way off.
   But the business in hand was very real and desperately urgent, and I do
   not think anyone would have noticed any hesitancy in pushing that door
   open; yet the next moment we were suddenly struck motionless as a low
   whisper reached us: 'For God's sake, move as quietly as you can!' We
   entered on tiptoe.
   There are some scenes which are stamped on the memory in such a way
   that they are never forgotten. Years after they can be called to the
   eye of the mind with wonderful fidelity to detail. The scene which met
   us was such a one.
   A broad beam from the setting sun came through the bottom of one of the
   windows, where the blind had not been completely drawn, and we saw.
   Very plainly, too, for the beam fell straight on it.
   Vickers lay stretched on his back in the middle of the room, with that
   grisly Thing straddled across his chest, its sucker buried in his
   throat. His face and lips were quite bloodless. His eyes were closed,
   and I could detect no sort of movement.
   I looked at Vane. His brows were contracted till they almost met, and
   his breath came and went through his teeth with a little hissing noise.
   I reminded him of the revolver ready cocked in his hand.
   'Don't be a fool!' he said irritably. 'Get some brandy, and, for
   Heaven's sake, look slippy!'
   When I returned he had his fingers on the poor fellow's wrist, and the
   frown was still on his face, but the revolver was on the box which was
   pierced with airholes.
   I suppose I must have looked puzzled. Vane spoke impatiently, yet his
   voice was hardly above a whisper.
   'Look here: what guarantee is there I should kill this vampire before
   it had time to discharge its deadly current through George's body ? You
   know as well as I do that creatures low down in the scale of creation
   take a lot of killing. We can't risk it, and I am sure we can't risk
   hauling it off.'
   The brandy was doing its work, and Vickers must have heard some of our
   conversation, because his eyes opened, and he said, with a ghost of a
   smile: 'Have you ever seen a leech applied, Charlie ?'
   I started violently.
   'Good heavens! you don't mean to say Vane and I have to hang about with
   our hands in our pockets doing nothing except speculating whether —
   whether —'
   ' Whether I shall be able to stand the drain till it shifts ?' Vickers
   smiled again as he took the words out of my mouth.
   The thought was intolerable; surely there must be some way!
   For hours Vane sat waiting. I also was waiting, but on a couch in
   another room, getting over the effects of a little blood transfusion.
   'It is very necessary,' Vane had said, as he skilfully made the
   arrangements, so skilfully that the creature was not disturbed. The
   improved appearance of poor George was my reward.
   Wearied in mind and body I fell asleep, and dreamed dreams of men and
   women I knew, but I gazed at them with horror, for they all had drawn,
   blanched faces, with great staring eyes, and something with its body
   across their chests and with head buried at their throats, and they
   beseeched me by all I held sacred to take it from them, but I was bound
   by invisible bands. How shall I tell of my agony of mind? I woke with a
   start, and in a terrible perspiration, and found the doctor looking at
   me, hollow-eyed and unshaved.
   'Nightmare?' he asked. 'Where did you want to go, and who wouldn't let
   you ? Steady, steady,' he added, as 1 jumped up and swayed, owing to
   the floor apparently moving about. As he pointed out, transfusion has
   no great tendency to make things appear as steady as rocks.
   'Has the thing moved?' I asked.
   'No,' he answered laconically.
   We looked at each other in silence. I was hoping he would guess my next
   question, but I had to ask it.
   'How is George ?'
   'Alive.' And I knew from the way he said it that he had told me simply
   the bare truth and that was all. There was another long silence.
   'Oh! can't we do something?' I cried despairingly.
   'Yes,' replied Vane. 'I am going to do something if that vampire does
   not move in ten minutes. The point has been reached when the risk is
   negligible, inasmuch as if it does not move now there will be no
   necessity of doing anything. I am going to shoot it.'
   We returned to that chamber of horrors. Poor Vickers looked ghastly,
   and it did not require a trained eye to see that the end was not far
   off.
   I took my watch out. 'Give it five minutes,' muttered Vane; and I sat
   on the box with the airholes, glancing first at the deathlike face of
   Vickers, then at Vane's set features as he stood stroking his unshaven
   chin, gazing at our friend.
   'Time's up,' I said.
   The doctor walked gently till he was opposite the creature's head, and
   dropped on one knee, then lowered the revolver till it was within six
   inches of its head. His finger was on the trigger when a strange thing
   occurred: the bloated monster suddenly withdrew its sucker and glared
   at him as if it knew that its hour of death had arrived. I thought Vane
   was fascinated by those baleful eyes, for he did not stir as the
   creature commenced to move towards him.
   'Look out!' I shouted, and he sprang back. None too soon, for the thing
   rushed at him with incredible swiftness.

   01A6AEPS
   Then I had an opportunity of witnessing Vane's beautiful nerve, for not
   until the last trailing filament had left Vickers did he fire. I saw
   his finger press the trigger. The next instant a terrific report shook
   the building, and my hands flew up to my eyes to shut out that terrible
   blinding flash. Women's screams, mingled with noises as if giant hands
   were tearing the house to pieces, floated up from below.
   The sound of someone groaning made me rouse myself.
   Vane lay face downwards in an immense pool of blood, his head hanging
   over a ragged hole in the floor. I thanked Heaven fervently when I
   found that he had only been stunned by the vast charge of static
   electricity the creature had suddenly let loose. Like a flash of
   lightning the charge had struck the floor, bursting it open, then torn
   its way through the house.
   We turned to Vickers. Vane felt his pulse.
   'I will save him,' he said. And he did.

1870 – Artificial Man – Orin Vasta (Swedish)

   A NEW ADAM IN SWEDEN. Curious Story from a Swedish Paper—
   How a Man was Made—What a New Being Thought and Felt—How He Acquired
   Ideas, etc., etc., etc.
   The New York World says: A Swedish paper makes the seemingly
   preposterous assertion that a scientific gentleman of Stockholm has
   succeeded in fabricating a man—not a "steam man," nor a man who goes by
   clock-work or springs, but a veritable man—whose flesh is such as is
   common to the genus homo, whose bones are filled with true marrow; who,
   if he does not think, talks as if he did; whose hair and nails grow;
   who breathes, lives, moves, and has his being, and in all particulars
   is such as he would have been had he been turned out in nature's
   workshop, and not in that of Orin Vasta. To be sure there are
   necessarily minor points of difference between this product of assisted
   nature and the ordinary products of unassisted nature. The being—for it
   is hardly right to call him a man, after all—has, of course, no
   recollections of childhood, or even of his brother, "the insensible
   rock and sluggish clod," with whom, twenty years ago, he was intimately
   acquainted. He has no past extending further back than three years, and
   as little understands the process of his fabrication as does the
   new-born child, and he came into conscious existence in a second, or
   even less, by a period corresponding with the rate at which the nerve
   force travels. He was born a full man, with a brain pan as capable of
   producing mature thought when material for thinking was supplied, as is
   an ordinary man of 25 years of age It took him only six months to learn
   to speak the Swedish language with tolerable ease, and then he was able
   to tell the impression made upon him by his existence, so accurate was
   his memory. By no means would we vouch for the truth of all this, but
   the story is good enough to be repeated.
   The way in which the monster was constructed is peculiar. Frankenstein
   was absolutely nothing compared with him. He was not made of wood and
   iron, but of various pieces of dead human bodies, carefully selected,
   preserved, prepared and adjusted in such a way that after the head was
   put on the shoulders, and the two pieces of spinal column joined at the
   neck, in an instant the nervous machinery acted, the heart palpitated,
   the lungs inhaled and exhaled air, the eyes opened, color came into the
   hitherto livid face, and all the processes of life began; the theory of
   this being that, as no two bodies are ever in actual contact, the
   molecules of man's body are not. Vital processes do not, therefore,
   need actual contact of particles in which they appear, there is,
   therefore, no necessary interrelation between them, and if by
   compression they can be forced to within the same distances from each
   other which they have in life, life must ensue when, by connecting the
   spinal column with the brain, transmission of nerve force becomes
   possible.
   Hereditary transmission of mental and physical qualities is impossible
   in a being thus constructed; for, as there is no germ, so there is no
   development of it; the being is but a composition of what is commonly
   called "dead matter." To all intents and purposes such a being is the
   primitive man of whom the world has heard so much, and therefore is
   fine material for psychological study.
   After twenty years passed in hitherto fruitless experiments, it may be
   believed that Orin Vasta was excited when, all things prepared for the
   calling into being of a monster, he proceeded with the experimentum
   crucis of joining the brain and the spinal marrow. To say that he was
   appalled by what he instantly saw is not to say an incredible thing,
   and, in very fright he fell to the floor, whereupon the newly created
   being did the same thing; but, when Orin arose, his creature lay still,
   for the very simple reason that it is very easy to fall but not to rise
   again till one has found out how to do so. But the fabricator helped
   his newly made friend to rise, and seated him in a chair. Whereupon all
   sorts of emotions were expressed in the man's face at what must have
   seemed to him a strange doubling and cracking of himself, but in
   reality, as he afterwards explained, he had no such thoughts at all,
   but was merely a curious machine in which emotions were expressed in
   the face because of reflex action of the nervous system. This is a
   curious point, for during all the time which intervened between his
   creation and the development of speech in him he says he neither felt
   joy nor sorrow, pain nor satisfaction, although be would often be seen
   to weep and laugh and express all emotions and passions as a human
   being expresses them. If struck he would cry out and pucker up his face
   as an infant does, but has afterwards remembered how he felt at such
   moments, and could relate his thoughts; of course his experience is
   valuable, where a child's cannot be obtained since the first two or
   three years of man's ordinary life are utterly forgotten and lost. This
   singular being said that when he was struck he knew it merely because
   he saw it and experienced a new sensation in his head, and which he did
   not refer to the place smitten.
   He had no desire to pucker up his face and cry, nor did he know that he
   did so till another different sensation which he felt in his ears
   seemed to set his head all in a whirl, one sensation begetting another
   until at last he thought that his head was all there was—that the room
   and his fabricator were all in it, and acting there as one. In other
   words, he was a sort of idealist, getting the universe under his own
   hat. Could he have expressed himself in philosophical language lie
   would not have said with Hume, that ideas and impressions were all that
   existed, but with some Germans, that ideas are all. But, to do him
   justice, he did not remain long in this condition of mind, for when his
   fabricator made him walk he obtained an idea of locality, and
   consequently of something that was not he, thereby making a great
   stride. But yet a more singular phenomenon than even these was noticed
   and afterwards interpreted by him. When he began to think he was
   conscious of an entirely new cerebral sensation, of disintegration of
   some fine substance within his head; he knew that this disintegration
   occasioned his thought and not vice versa. On this principle he
   afterward explained the well-known fact that in mental science, called
   the association of ideas, since mechanical action among molecules
   cannot but result in other and connected motions, and hence, if their
   product be ideas, these must always seem and actually be connected,
   while on no hypothesis except this is that remarkable fact explicable.
   As time went on and the man had become gradually separated from his
   notion that he was all that existed, a feeling of awe and reverence
   sprung up within him for Vasta, whom naturally enough he called his
   master, and whom he considered a superior being, inasmuch as he felt
   himself in his power. He would pray that he might see his face always,
   for he loved him. To try an experiment Vasta withheld food from his
   creature for a day, and when asked for it took it from his pocket and
   bestowed it upon the poor fellow, who thenceforth for some time begged
   him night and morning not to withhold food from him. Afterward Vasta
   discovered that the man had formulated a prayer in which he, Vasta, was
   called the "Bread giver," and, merely from philanthropic motives, he
   dispelled this illusion, as he knew that its inevitable result would be
   to make the man very lazy. At first he had no idea of size, solidity,
   perspective or the ordinary properties of matter; but, when taught
   geometry, made most rapid progress, and when told one day that a
   straight line was the shortest distance between two points, astonished
   his master by saying: "No; a line is not distance at all ; a straight
   line is the shortest line between two points." He looked at all things
   in the most matter-of-fact way, but accounted for them in the most
   whimsical. There was, according to him, a "goodness" that made things
   good, an "evil principle" that made them bad, a "beauty" that made them
   beautiful, an "intellect" that made his master wise, and a "chairness"
   or "boxness" that made things chairs and boxes.
   But as he became more conversant with nature these opinions faded away.
   Taken from his room into the streets of Stockholm, he saw men like
   Vasta, he saw houses and strange animals, and these set him to
   thinking, but when he went into the woods and fields and saw how plants
   and animals grew and the conditions of their existence, his views
   changed entirely. Vasta was no longer a god, but a man like himself. It
   was in the woods that the manner in which he was brought into conscious
   life was explained to him; how he was like other men in that every
   particle of his body was at first taken from his ancestors—if the dead
   bodies from which he was made can be called by so sacred a name—but
   that he differed from others merely in the fact that he was the result
   of a great scientific experiment, and had been produced merely for
   scientific purposes. "You see," said Vasta, "evidence of design in
   every part of the body; see how particular I was to put your eyes in
   your head instead of in your heels." "But why,"
   was he answer, "did you not place them on long flexible protuberances
   in my forehead, so that I might have seen
   in all directions without changing my position?" "Ah," said the old
   man, smiling benevolently; "had I done so how could you have worn a
   hat? In other words, how could you have been a social being ? Socially,
   it is as necessary to wear a hat as to have a moral nature." "But why
   not give me more hands with which better to earn a living and pursue
   science, to which I devote my life?"
   Again the old man smiled. "Political economy would not stand it—it
   would have taken all your earnings to supply yourself with gloves, and
   thereby the mass of men would suffer, for nature has so arranged
   matters that in the universe there can be at any given time only gloves
   enough to supply the actual and ordinary number of hands." And so at
   every turn was this strange being taught by the philosopher who had
   only skill enough to make him, and in the end to leave him to shift for
   himself.

   1960 – "Beauregard" the Robot by Tom Graham.

   tom-robot-1960-press-1-x640

   There are 17 buttons on the control panel, which Tom uses to make the
   mechanical man do his bidding. Aided by his machinist dad, the lad
   labored for 15 months to perfect the robot.

   Operating a 17-button control panel, Tom Graham is able to make his
   home-made automaton move about the room on rollers, move its head,
   swing its arms, pick up objects and blink its eyes.

   JUNK MAN
   "You called, Master?" is what "Beauregard" the robot seems to be saying
   to Tom Graham, 13, as the latter awakens at home in Madison, Tenn. The
   youngster utilized junk parts to build his unusual playmate. 27 Feb,
   1960.

   When it's time for "Beauregard" to get a little fresh air, Tom needs a
   helper to get the tin can man outside. Here, Ronnie Smith assists in
   toting the 100-pound automaton. The rollers beneath the robot's feet
   require a level surface, so it's seldom taken from the house.

   Junk Man

   Most boys enjoy a good scrap, but Tom Graham prefers a scrappy playmate
   who doesn't fight back. Using junk parts, the inventive Madison, Tenn.,
   youngster has built a mechanical pal that's tough as metal but gentle
   as a kid brother. Aided by his machinist dad, 13-year-old Tom took 15
   months to build and perfect his robot playmate. Named "Beauregard," the
   automaton can "walk" across the room on rollers, pick up objects and
   blink his two green eyes. It is constructed of old lard cans, coffee
   cans, an oil drum and discarded furnace pipes. Powered by four castoff
   electric motors, the robot's innards are a maze of chains, wheels and
   assorted wires.

   July 19, 1965: The original published caption reported:

   GADGET FOR TODAY–Author Lawrence Lipton, chronicler of the beatnik
   scene, demonstrates his “robot,” Duhab (Detector of Undesirable
   HABitués). Lipton says robot ferrets out the undesirables – including
   censors, book-burners.

   By 1965, media outlets were reporting the beatnik era over. Not so,
   claimed Lipton, whose 1959 best seller, “The Holy Barbarians,”
   chronicled the Venice scene. As quoted in a Times article by staff
   writer Doug Mauldin, Lipton explained, “What happened is that the
   artistic element has gone underground. Artists, writers, painters and
   avant-garde filmmakers live and work in their own pads.”

   “And there are two or three times as many true beats here as there were
   in the 1950s when they were getting all the publicity.”

   But, as pointed out in Mauldin’s story:

   He (Lipton) is particularly bitter about past campaigns to rid Venice
   of the Beatniks.

   “The Venice West beat scene was the most promising attempt ever made to
   bring avant-garde culture to Southern California, and it was murdered
   by self-righteous, puritanical busy-bodies and hostile police,” he
   said.

   The above portrait of Lipton accompanied Mauldin’s story in the July
   29, 1965, Westside Edition of the Los Angeles Times.

   Larry Lipton, as "director of entertainment" for the Gas House, seemed
   torn between wanting to win and wanting to be right. Shortly after one
   of the police commissioners told him he had a responsibility to keep
   "undesirables" out of the Gas House, Lipton returned with an
   extraordinary contraption which he solemnly described as an "electronic
   doorman." Built to his specifications by the Gas House light crew and
   decorated by Bill Riola, it was a primitive but functioning robot with
   a little popeyed face, a built-in tape recorder, and an incredible
   array of sirens, whistles, bells, and flashing red lights.
   "Duhab"—short for "Detector of Undesirable Habitués"-was described as
   being able to sense the approach of "teenage werewolves, dope addicts,
   sex fiends, subversives, alcoholics, and homosexuals (male and
   female)," and members of the Venice Civic Union-in which event, all of
   its alarms were set to go off at once. Duhab made good theater, but bad
   hearing strategy; it helped make Lipton himself the issue, and gave the
   hearing examiner, Officer Thomas Mulhern, the opportunity to focus on
   the "moral character" of those who would be directing "the proposed
   entertainment."

   Two-Week Delay Ordered in Venice 'Beatnik' Hearings
   The West Venice "Beatniks" will have to wait two weeks before their
   request to have a City Police Commission examiner disqualified will be
   considered.
   The commissioners refused Wednesday to discuss charges of prejudice
   against examiner Thomas Mulherin, who conducted hearings for an
   entertainment licence at a beatnik "culture center" known as the Gas
   House and located in West Venice.
   Cries "Unfair!"
   President John Ferraro said the disqualification charges will not he
   discussed until all commissioners have had a chance to study the
   transcript, which includes more than 1000 pages of testimony.
   Atty. A. L. Wirin, representing Atty. Al Matthews, owner of the Gas
   House, told the commission that he was being treated unfairly and that
   he had been told the matter would be on Wednesday's agenda.
   Ferraro speculated that it would be two weeks before the commissioners
   will he prepared to discuss the matter.
   In a brief filed last week, Wirin accused Mulherin of "unfair and
   prejudicial conduct" in conducting hearings on an application for an
   entertainment permit at the Gas House, 1540 Ocean Front Walk.
   Wirin, accompanied by Matthews and beatnik author Lawrence Lipton, was
   not permitted to discuss the matter at all at Wednesday's session.
   Complaint Detailed
   Before the session, Wirin said he would base his arguments on three
   main points brought out by earlier hearings in which he claims Mulherin
   showed "prejudice and bias" against the beatniks. They are:
   1—That Mulherin said he doubted whether Lawrence Lipton, author of "The
   Holy Barbarians," knew the meaning of the word "moral."
   2—That Mulherin said he doubted—after reading Lipton's book—that Lipton
   was a responsible person to manage entertainment at the Gas House.
   3—That Mulherin accused Lipton of injecting the racial issue into the
   hearings when, Wirin said, it was the commission's representative who
   injected it into the hearings prior to Lipton's testimony.
   Wirin said he will cite numerous items in the transcript of earlier
   hearings to support his motion to disqualify Mulherin.
   Have Poetic Robot
   The newly-formed defense committee for Culture in Venice, headed by
   Robert Chatter-on, announced that several mass meetings will be held to
   raise money for the entertainment license fight. At these meetings,
   typical Gas House entertainment programs will be offered, it was
   stated.
   One of the meetings will be held in the Gas House, but a beatnik
   robot—that writes and recites poetry with music—will be used.
   "The idea." Chatterton explained, "is that a robot does not rate as
   'live entertainment,' which the police have banned at the Gas House,
   pending the license hearings.
   Names New Device
   The beatniks promised to bring to this afternoon's hearing the bearded
   and sandaled Duhab, the electronic robot "detector of undesirable
   habitués," which Lipton said is capable of "screening out alcoholics,
   dope fiends, teenage werewolves and other undesirables at the door,
   thus evading the wrath of the Venice Civic Union.
   "A new detection device has been added since Duhab was unveiled last
   week," Lipton added.
   "It is a set of heavenly chimes that sound on the appearance at the Gas
   House door of any member of the Civic Union."

1965 – “Mr. Obos” the Robot – Lou Nasti (American)

   Mr_Obos_1965 photo1-x640

   New York Times, March 20, 1965 – By PHILIP H. DOUGHERTY – Print
   Headline: "So What Else Is New? A Robot Makes Debut on Flatbush Ave."

   So What Else Is New? A Robot Makes Debut on Flatbush Ave.

   ROBOT IN RESIDENCE: Mr. Obos blinks his many lights at the electronic
   direction of his inventor, Louis Nasti, in the basement of the Nasti
   apartment house in Flatbush. Besides blinking, robot walks, talks and
   moves arms.

   The other fellows around East 38th Street and Flatbush Avenue have had
   a pretty busy winter, what with shooting pool at Cannon's, going to
   dances and all that.
   But where has Louis Nasti been? He's been in the basement of the
   Styling by Silhouette beauty parlor every free minute, and what he's
   been doing has really become a neighborhood topic. No wonder, for how
   many fellows are building 6-foot 5-inch, copper-colored robots around
   Flatbush Avenue these days?
   Mr. Obos (he's the robot) was showing off the other night in the
   basement of 1866 Flatbush Avenue that he shares with a furnace.
   Nineteen-year-old, 5-foot 4-inch Louis was at the lecternlike,
   23-switch control panel as Mr. Obos, in a deep, taped voice, ticked off
   his physical assets.
   "I can do 11 different things." bragged Mr. Obos, antenna twirling as
   blue eyes and red nose blinked.
   "He's great," interrupted Mrs. Marie Nasti, her plump 5-foot frame
   unable to hold all of her pride. It was not clear whether she was
   speaking of her son, the inventor, or the invention.
   "There are 100 lights outlining my body and 475 feet of running wire
   from the back of my leg to my controls," continued Mr. Obos with some
   satisfaction.
   Mr. Obos's chin flapped and torso spun in half circles on its
   marble-mounted waistline as nine little electric motors whirred
   silently.

   "It comes apart in five pieces," young Louis said, leaping to open Mr.
   Obos's right ankle where a 21-foot power-bearing cable enters the body.
   The wires are connected to a cable, the cable is connected to a switch
   panel, the panel is connected to an outlet — oh hear the word of Con
   Ed.
   "It looks sharp in the dark." said young Louis, a thin, well-dressed
   young man with wavy black hair, interrupting both his mother and Mr.
   Obos.
   Louis explained that he built the robot for the employees' hobby show
   at Abraham & Straus, where he is in home furnishings display. "They
   really like me there." he said. Louis has also built a coffinlike box
   for Mr. Obos and plans to move him to the store today.
   Upstairs in the Nastis' three-room apartment (father Attilion was still
   at work), Louis talked of some of the other thing's he has built,
   including a robot who did the twist.
   "When I was at Midwood High School (he was graduated in 1963) I built a
   rocket and a radar interceptor—had two airplanes take off and actually
   collide in the classroom." he said.
   Now that Mr. Obos, who got his name from Sobos glue, is finished and
   all the papier-mache in place and painted on its body of five-gallon
   oil cans, Louis feels let down. "I went down to the cellar and just sat
   and looked at him last night." he said.
   But he has future plans. "I think," Louis said, "I'll build a family of
   robots-remote controlled with radio waves-that look like soldiers, not
   robots." There was a faraway look in his eyes.

   Thanks to Lou Nasti and colleague Bob Kovacs in providing the New York
   Times article.

   holidaylights-lou-nasti

   Lou Nasti, looking rather like Disney's Geppetto, set up his animated
   display's business in 1969 and is still going strong. See Animated
   Displays Inc.

   He has a robot called Rodney.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/O8frJPoh998

   Comment source: here. c2013.

     Lou Nasti is famous for his animated window displays. His work is
     very amiable and seems like it appeals to the younger audience,
     however can be a fun experience for all ages. Enjoyment and
     entertainment is found everywhere in his displays. His “Santa’s
     workshop” can be found in Brooklyn commonly known as Lou Nasti’s
     Brooklyn company, Mechanical Displays Inc. He is well known for
     creating displays that have holiday themes and bring out the fantasy
     in every holiday, such as Santa Claus and his elves. These famous
     displays can mainly be found in department stores such as Macy’s.

     His famous career started as a teenager when he started as a window
     dresser. His fame up roared when he created a talking and walking
     robot. His work is amazing and is viewed by many every year. However
     the main obstacle for Lou Nasti every year is putting up a Christmas
     tree in his own home. Despite this obstacle, he still creates the
     best displays filled with imagination. His displays circulate around
     the country, that’s how good he is.

     Another important obstacle that not only Lou Nasti faces but
     department stores face is online shopping and how it has affected
     businesses in stores. It’s up to Lou Nasti to work night and day to
     change this and help boost up this line of work. His theme seems to
     be “bigger is better.” Lou Nasti continues to work hard, recently
     creating a huge children’s train ride through a sprawling peppermint
     forest for the Galt House Hotel in Louisville, Ky. However, his
     foremost project is to create a life sized theme park named Nasti
     Land.

   Computerized mouse maze first of 3 long-term projects for Xenian.

   by Ward Pimley – Gazette staff writer

   To a research psychologist, running a mouse through a maze to
   investigate behavior patterns is a common occurrence. But to an
   electronic engineering drawing specialist who wants to simulate the
   test, various alterations must be made.
   Richard Browne, a drawing specialist in his seventh year with Systems
   Research Laboratories, Inc. (SRL), has recently finished a lengthy
   project designed to propel a wooden mouse through a maze with
   directions being supplied by a computer. He resides at 2004 Tahoe Dr.
   COMMONLY, referred to as cybernetics, the system constructed by Browne
   uses a computer attachment which receives data from the mouse as to its
   location and the presence or absence of barriers, The computer then
   tells the mouse which direction to move based upon the data. While the
   mouse is searching for its "cheese," a metal block which short circuits
   the electric charge upon contact, the computer is storing in its
   "memory" information pertaining to the maze; that is, where the alley
   blocks are and what routes are beneficial to the mouse's search for the
   goal.
   CYBERNETICS is a branch of science which mechanically and
   electronically attempts to reproduce the human thinking process into
   machines. Browne's computer, designed to comply with this principle, is
   programmed to receive information from the mouse, "analyze" the
   situation, then direct the mouse on its journey. The mouse, one-inch
   creature carved from balsa wood, has two copper whiskers which signal
   the computer when the mouse has bumped into a maze barrier.
   Directional information is then sent back to the mouse whereupon an
   electromagnet beneath the aluminum maze moves the mouse in the
   direction indicated. The electromagnet is driven by two one tenth
   horsepower engines which control both north-south and east-west
   movements of the mouse.
   THE COMPUTER, 600 pounds of wires and relays, has the capability of
   processing both partial and total accumulations of "knowledge." The
   partial knowledge refers to the store of information regarding the
   squares in which the mouse has investigated, while the total
   accumulation is the computer's memory of the correct path the mouse
   should take to solve the maze. After the mouse has found the goal, it
   may be placed anywhere along the proper path and it will move directly
   to the goal without either making detours or bumping into alley walls.
   There is an exploration strategy which the mouse follows, Browne
   explained, every time it enters a square. Five steps are involved, all
   occurring within one-tenth of a second. The procedure is repetitive and
   designed so that the mouse will examine all possible avenues of escape
   from a square. If the mouse should encounter a wall in one direction,
   it then turns 90 degrees clockwise. If there is no wall in that
   direction, the mouse will exit the square. Otherwise, it will turn
   again to check a new direction. There are 25 squares on the maze with
   removable walls for reshaping the maze. Browne, said there are 873
   duodecillion/(873 followed by 12 zeroes) solvable maze patterns
   possible in his operation. Should the mouse solve one million maze
   patterns per second (clearly an impossible task), it would take the
   mouse 2.7 septillion (seven zeros) centuries to solve all
   possibilities, Browne said.
   THE PROJECT took Browne 10 years to complete, working on and off, he
   said. The idea for the maze came from a May 1955 issue of Popular
   Mechanics where an article was printed about a man who had completed
   such a project. Browne decided to duplicate the feat, although he
   designed and constructed the computer by himself. While Browne built
   his unit with spare parts, he said that a computer and maze constructed
   from new parts (and including labor costs) would cost about $15,000.
   The present project is completed, Browne said, except for a couple of
   minor improvements to be made. One of these is to put wheels on the
   mouse to facilitate easier movements. The other is to replace the
   magnet in the mouse with a stronger one so that the mouse will not
   escape from the electromagnet's pull from under the table.

   However, Browne is not quitting his dabbling with home made electronic
   projects. He presently has in mind two further projects to operate from
   the computer he has already built. One of these is a model railroad,
   which Browne estimates will take him 15 years to complete (working on
   and off of course). The other is an electromagnetic calculator which
   will perform complicated mathematics.

   Man's creative urge, it seems, still lives in Richard Browne.

1953 – Tobor the Robot – Dave Ballard (American)

   From the "Captain Video" TV serial, the "I, Tobor" episodes starting
   the week of November 2, 1953.

   Tobor (played by 7' 6" Dave Ballard) was a prototype robot designed to
   be a tireless worker and indestructible soldier. It bore the
   inscription "I-TOBOR" (a reversed image of ROBOT-I) on its chest plate.

   Tobor's body featured a cylindrical manlike form, rockets mounted on
   its back; an antenna sprouting skywards from each shoulder; a
   triangular flap of metal on its chest containing a lens which shot a
   death ray; and activation by voice commands via a pocket-sized device
   attuned to the vocal frequency of its controller. Tobor also had giant
   claw pincers as hands.

   Tobor was originally designed as a force for good in the universe,
   until Atar, a villainous female reset the robot's voice circuits to
   obey only her commands. Now in control of the powerful robot, Atar set
   out to conquer the solar system.

   Tobor was finally rendered harmless when Captain Video, matching Atar's
   vocal frequency, sent conflicting commands to Tobor and disrupted its
   circuitry.

   Months later (due to popular demand) Tobor was reactivated but this
   time under the guidance of Captain Video's voice. A video monitor was
   built into his metallic naval for closed circuit communication.

   In a later episode, an evil scientist stole Tobor's blueprints and
   created a duplicate Tobor. A colossal battle of good vs. evil ensued
   with Tobor fighting his evil twin.

   Tobor the robot was prominently featured in serial episodes: "I, Tobor"
   (1953);  "The Return of Tobor the Robot (1954); and "Dr. Pauli's
   Planet" (1955).

     In case anyone didn't know, there's a man inside the robot on the TV
     "Captain Video" series. He's a fellow called Dave Ballard, a 7-foot
     8-inch giant. His trouble as a TV actor is that there aren't enough
     roles for giants.

   Tobor Trivia:
    1. Its been said that Tobor is the first robot to appear in a TV
       series, beginning the week of November 2, 1953. It should be noted
       that the earlier robots from Captain Video were from a film serial,
       not TV.   To my knowledge, the Superman TV serial had the first
       robot – Adventures of Superman: Season 1, Episode 17, The Runaway
       Robot (9 Jan. 1953).
    2. Other forums suggest the reason why the robot is called Tobor is
       due to a stencil being cut on the wrong side, hence reversed in its
       application. As we haven't seen an image of Tobor with his name
       emblazoned on his chest, this cannot be confirmed yet.
    3. A different looking robot appeared in the earlier 1951 film serial
       Captain Video Master of the Stratosphere and first appeared in
       Chapter 3 "Captain Video's Peril".
    4. The 1954 movie "Tobor the Great" was a different robot as well.

   Note: Mon Jan 18, 2016, Peter Milo contacted me:-

     Hi. I ran across your article regarding Tobor from the Captain Video
     show. I remember the first episode quite vividly: The stencil was
     accidentally reversed when the name was painted. Hence: I TOBOR

     I also had the good fortune of meeting the entire cast in person and
     got to see the actual filming of an episode at the DuMont studio
     (my dad was a mounted cop in that area and had many friends along
     his beat).   Al Hodges was really a friendly individual, as was the
     rest of the crew. I left the studio that evening with a bunch of
     Powerhouse candy bars. LOL

     Hi Peter,
     Thanks for confirming the stencil story. Do you recall TOBOR as
     having large claws as hands? Cheers, Reuben Hoggett.

     Hello, Reuben. Thanks again for creating such an informative sight.
     Tobor had large pincer claws, which greatly added to his overall
     menace. A model robot, which really didn’t resemble Tobor, was used
     for his space travel scenes. I remember my friends debating this
     anomaly; they finally chalked it up to poor photography in outer
     space.    The episode with the rock monsters was being telecast on
     the evening I visited the studio. I remember being quite surprised
     by the special effects (a couple technicians were lying on the
     floor, pulling ropes). When I glanced up at the monitor, it seemed
     that the large rocks were moving on their own. Really cool stuff.
     Best Regards, Peter Milo.
