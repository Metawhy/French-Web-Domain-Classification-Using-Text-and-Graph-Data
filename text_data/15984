The art of breakfast

   [DSC_0838.JPG.jpg]
   As we all know breakfast is the most important meal of a day. For
   breakfast you can eat absolutely everything you want and as much as you
   want. But also all the food your gonna eat doesn`t mean anything if
   your eating it fast, standing or watching TV...than actually you`re not
   eating that food your "eating" that program on television(don`t laugh
   on this, but it`s true, really...). So go ahead and make pleasure for
   yourself every morning from now on!!!  Also while breakfast you can put
   on your favorite music on and pleasure is guaranteed!

   So this time I`m giving you a recipe that I love the most for
   breakfast, you must try to make it, `cause when you try it once you
