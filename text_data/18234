       use)

     __________________________________________________________________

Visitor Statistics Cookies

   We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people
   have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g.
   Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn't working as
   it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the
   site, what page they look at etc.

   This helps us to continuously improve our website. These analytics
   programs also tell us if how people reached this site (e.g. from a

Advertisements

   We fund our site by showing adverts as you browse our site. These
   adverts are usually managed by a partner specializing in providing
   adverts for multiple sites. Invariably these partners place cookies to
   collect anonymous data about the websites you visits so they can
   personalize the adverts to you, ensure that you don't see the same
   adverts too frequently and ultimately report to advertisers on which
   adverts are working.
     __________________________________________________________________

Turning Cookies Off

   You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings
   to stop it from accepting cookies. Your browser help function will tell
   you how. Doing so however will limit the functionality of most of the
   world's websites as cookies are a standard part of websites.
