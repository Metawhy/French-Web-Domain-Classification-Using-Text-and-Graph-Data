   For the first time since the creation of this forward-facing
   intrapreneurship program, the LVMH Group organized its DARE (Disrupt
   Act Risk to be an Entrepreneur) event in London. For three days, Group
   employees across the EMEA region – selected from 450 talents
   shortlisted following a call for ideas to  “Shaping the Customer
   Experience of Tomorrow” – joined one another to brainstorm in London.
   The fruit of their reflections was presented to a jury of executives
   from LVMH and its Maisons, along with outside entrepreneurs. The jury
   selected three winning projects that will be sponsored within the
   highest level of the organization.

   LVMH created DARE in 2017, reflecting a conviction that its own
   employees are an outstanding source of knowledge and creativity to fuel
   innovation and excellence. This initiative gives LVMH employees,
   regardless of their position within the Group, an opportunity to
   express their vision of innovation and transform their ideas into
   concrete projects.

   Under the leadership of Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH Group Executive Vice
   President, Human Resources & Synergies, DARE was developed by the
   members of LVMH House, a mansion in the heart of London’s Mayfair
   district that embodies a label of excellence for talent development for
   senior executives and high potentials. This unique worldwide program is
   cross-brand and cross-sector, encompassing all areas of expertise and
   all generations.

   “The DARE initiative is a cornerstone of our talent development
   strategy, rooted in our core belief that it is our people who make the
   difference. It is an opportunity for our talents from all over the
   world to develop and hone their skillset, to network, and to discover
   and share ideas with the aim of fostering open innovation within the
   group. It promotes a culture of entrepreneurship within the Group that
   is a fundamental value of LVMH,” stated Chantal Gaemperle.

   Since its launch DARE has focused on a variety of topics, from the
   future of luxury and sustainable development to gender equality, with
   events in France, Italy, China and the United States. For the DARE
   event in London, over 13,000 employees from across LVMH based in
   Europe, Middle East and Africa were invited to submit an idea related
   to customer experience innovations.

   The 60 participants selected for DARE London were split into 12 teams
   and joined by students from Central Saint Martins and Imperial College
   London. The teams worked on their projects at LVMH House to turn their
   ideas into business plans, which were then challenged by mentors before
   being pitched to the jury.

   Congratulations to all participants and save the date for the next
   edition of DARE in Tokyo on November 12.

   In 2014 LVMH created the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME), a
   vocational training program that allows the Group to ensure the
   transmission of its unique savoir-faire and promote careers in
   traditional craftsmanship métiers among young generations, at the same
   time developing their employability.

   A groundbreaking initiative in the luxury industry, the Institut des
   Métiers d’Excellence LVMH offers training through partnerships with
   leading schools throughout Europe in key sectors for LVMH (jewelry,
   vineyards and winemaking, couture, retail, design, leather goods,
   watchmaking and culinary arts).

   Student apprentices taking the courses receive both technical training
   and theoretical  education. They alternate between sessions at partner
   schools and practical experience at LVMH Maisons or specialists in a
   given sector, working under paid professional training contracts.

   IME apprentices also take foreign language classes, meet regularly with
   skilled artisans, experts and designers, and visit the workshops and
   stores of LVMH Maisons.

   The IME has trained more than 500 young people since its creation. The
   program had a 96% graduation rate in 2017 and nearly 90% of the
   graduates found jobs after completing the program – two-thirds of them
   with LVMH Maisons. The IME continues to achieve the objectives set when
   the program was launched: develop the employability of youth who are
   either unskilled or seeking to learn new skills, while passing on the
   invaluable savoir-faire of LVMH Maisons to new generations.

   The LVMH Maisons taking part in the IME program are Berluti, Bulgari,
   Céline, Chaumet, Christian Dior Couture, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Fred,
   Givenchy, Guerlain, Hennessy, Hublot, Kenzo, La Grande Epicerie, Le Bon
   Marché Rive Gauche, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Make
   Up For Ever, Moët & Chandon, Moynat, Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums
   Givenchy, Sephora, TAG Heuer, Veuve Clicquot and Zenith.

   In order to protect and develop our Fashion & Leather Goods Houses'
   access to the raw materials and superior savoir-faire they require,
   LVMH Métiers d'Art provides long-term investment and support for its
   best suppliers.

   With its partner suppliers, LVMH Métiers d’Art implements a
   comprehensive sustainable development strategy: in the sourcing of
   quality, raw materials (often rare or increasingly scarce) and in
   enriching the transmission of savoir-faire (at times traditional,
   unique and specific to our industry).

   Beyond this, and in line with the Group’s values, LVMH Métiers d’Art
   sharpens artisan creativity and innovation in all its forms, through
   shared projects, exchanges between “métiers” and external partnerships.

   In this way, within the leather “métiers”, LVMH Métiers d’Art joined
   forces with the Koh brothers in order to develop the Heng Long tannery
   in Singapore. Founded in 1950, it is now the leader in the tanning of
   crocodile hides. In 2012, LVMH acquired the Roux Tanneries, one of the
   last remaining French tanneries specialized in tanning calf hides,
   founded in 1803.

   In 2015 LVMH acquired a stake in the Spanish tannery Riba-Guixà, a
   leading specialist in Entrefino lambskin processing.

   LVMH has always been devoted to supporting the talent of tomorrow. In
   2014, the Group reaffirmed this commitment with the creation of the
   LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers.

   Its concept, content and international scope are unprecedented, and
   each edition of the LVMH Prize recognizes the talent of a particularly
   outstanding designer, selected by a jury of Artistic Directors from our
   Houses.

   “The LVMH Prize aims to support young fashion designers. This
   sponsorship initiative reflects the values of our Group: our designers
   single out the talent of tomorrow, and they are rewarded and supported
   through the development of their House. Our ambition is to nurture the
   vitality and creativity of the fashion world at the international
   level. As a leader in our sector, it is our responsibility to discover
   young talents and help them to develop,” explains Delphine Arnault,
   Executive Vice-President of Louis Vuitton.

   The winner of the LVMH prize will receive a 300,000 euro grant and
   personalized assistance in the development of his or her company from a
   specific team within the Group, over a period of twelve months, as from
   the presentation of the LVMH Prize. This assistance is available from
   all the areas of expertise which may interest a burgeoning fashion
   House (production and distribution, image and communication, marketing,
   intellectual property, and so on).

   LVMH also rewards three young fashion design graduates, offering them
   the chance to spend a year with the creative team at one of the Group’s
   Houses.

   Since its first edition, the LVMH Prize has rewarded several talents:
   Thomas Tait, Miuniki, Hood by Air, Marques’Almeida, Simon Porte
   Jacquemus, Grace Wales Bonner, Vejas Kruszewski, Marine Serre, Kozaburo
   Akasaka, Masayuki Ino, Rok Hwang, …

   For the first time since the creation of this forward-facing
   intrapreneurship program, the LVMH Group organized its DARE (Disrupt
   Act Risk to be an Entrepreneur) event in London. For three days, Group
   employees across the EMEA region – selected from 450 talents
   shortlisted following a call for ideas to  “Shaping the Customer
   Experience of Tomorrow” – joined one another to brainstorm in London.
   The fruit of their reflections was presented to a jury of executives
   from LVMH and its Maisons, along with outside entrepreneurs. The jury
   selected three winning projects that will be sponsored within the
   highest level of the organization.

   LVMH created DARE in 2017, reflecting a conviction that its own
   employees are an outstanding source of knowledge and creativity to fuel
   innovation and excellence. This initiative gives LVMH employees,
   regardless of their position within the Group, an opportunity to
   express their vision of innovation and transform their ideas into
   concrete projects.

   Under the leadership of Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH Group Executive Vice
   President, Human Resources & Synergies, DARE was developed by the
   members of LVMH House, a mansion in the heart of London’s Mayfair
   district that embodies a label of excellence for talent development for
   senior executives and high potentials. This unique worldwide program is
   cross-brand and cross-sector, encompassing all areas of expertise and
   all generations.

   “The DARE initiative is a cornerstone of our talent development
   strategy, rooted in our core belief that it is our people who make the
   difference. It is an opportunity for our talents from all over the
   world to develop and hone their skillset, to network, and to discover
   and share ideas with the aim of fostering open innovation within the
   group. It promotes a culture of entrepreneurship within the Group that
   is a fundamental value of LVMH,” stated Chantal Gaemperle.

   Since its launch DARE has focused on a variety of topics, from the
   future of luxury and sustainable development to gender equality, with
   events in France, Italy, China and the United States. For the DARE
   event in London, over 13,000 employees from across LVMH based in
   Europe, Middle East and Africa were invited to submit an idea related
   to customer experience innovations.

   The 60 participants selected for DARE London were split into 12 teams
   and joined by students from Central Saint Martins and Imperial College
   London. The teams worked on their projects at LVMH House to turn their
   ideas into business plans, which were then challenged by mentors before
   being pitched to the jury.

   Congratulations to all participants and save the date for the next
   edition of DARE in Tokyo on November 12.

   In 2014 LVMH created the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME), a
   vocational training program that allows the Group to ensure the
   transmission of its unique savoir-faire and promote careers in
   traditional craftsmanship métiers among young generations, at the same
   time developing their employability.

   A groundbreaking initiative in the luxury industry, the Institut des
   Métiers d’Excellence LVMH offers training through partnerships with
   leading schools throughout Europe in key sectors for LVMH (jewelry,
   vineyards and winemaking, couture, retail, design, leather goods,
   watchmaking and culinary arts).

   Student apprentices taking the courses receive both technical training
   and theoretical  education. They alternate between sessions at partner
   schools and practical experience at LVMH Maisons or specialists in a
   given sector, working under paid professional training contracts.

   IME apprentices also take foreign language classes, meet regularly with
   skilled artisans, experts and designers, and visit the workshops and
   stores of LVMH Maisons.

   The IME has trained more than 500 young people since its creation. The
   program had a 96% graduation rate in 2017 and nearly 90% of the
   graduates found jobs after completing the program – two-thirds of them
   with LVMH Maisons. The IME continues to achieve the objectives set when
   the program was launched: develop the employability of youth who are
   either unskilled or seeking to learn new skills, while passing on the
   invaluable savoir-faire of LVMH Maisons to new generations.

   The LVMH Maisons taking part in the IME program are Berluti, Bulgari,
   Céline, Chaumet, Christian Dior Couture, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Fred,
   Givenchy, Guerlain, Hennessy, Hublot, Kenzo, La Grande Epicerie, Le Bon
   Marché Rive Gauche, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Make
   Up For Ever, Moët & Chandon, Moynat, Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums
   Givenchy, Sephora, TAG Heuer, Veuve Clicquot and Zenith.

   In order to protect and develop our Fashion & Leather Goods Houses'
   access to the raw materials and superior savoir-faire they require,
   LVMH Métiers d'Art provides long-term investment and support for its
   best suppliers.

   With its partner suppliers, LVMH Métiers d’Art implements a
   comprehensive sustainable development strategy: in the sourcing of
   quality, raw materials (often rare or increasingly scarce) and in
   enriching the transmission of savoir-faire (at times traditional,
   unique and specific to our industry).

   Beyond this, and in line with the Group’s values, LVMH Métiers d’Art
   sharpens artisan creativity and innovation in all its forms, through
   shared projects, exchanges between “métiers” and external partnerships.

   In this way, within the leather “métiers”, LVMH Métiers d’Art joined
   forces with the Koh brothers in order to develop the Heng Long tannery
   in Singapore. Founded in 1950, it is now the leader in the tanning of
   crocodile hides. In 2012, LVMH acquired the Roux Tanneries, one of the
   last remaining French tanneries specialized in tanning calf hides,
   founded in 1803.

   In 2015 LVMH acquired a stake in the Spanish tannery Riba-Guixà, a
   leading specialist in Entrefino lambskin processing.

   LVMH has always been devoted to supporting the talent of tomorrow. In
   2014, the Group reaffirmed this commitment with the creation of the
   LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers.

   Its concept, content and international scope are unprecedented, and
   each edition of the LVMH Prize recognizes the talent of a particularly
   outstanding designer, selected by a jury of Artistic Directors from our
   Houses.

   “The LVMH Prize aims to support young fashion designers. This
   sponsorship initiative reflects the values of our Group: our designers
   single out the talent of tomorrow, and they are rewarded and supported
   through the development of their House. Our ambition is to nurture the
   vitality and creativity of the fashion world at the international
   level. As a leader in our sector, it is our responsibility to discover
   young talents and help them to develop,” explains Delphine Arnault,
   Executive Vice-President of Louis Vuitton.

   The winner of the LVMH prize will receive a 300,000 euro grant and
   personalized assistance in the development of his or her company from a
   specific team within the Group, over a period of twelve months, as from
   the presentation of the LVMH Prize. This assistance is available from
   all the areas of expertise which may interest a burgeoning fashion
   House (production and distribution, image and communication, marketing,
   intellectual property, and so on).

   LVMH also rewards three young fashion design graduates, offering them
   the chance to spend a year with the creative team at one of the Group’s
   Houses.

   Since its first edition, the LVMH Prize has rewarded several talents:
   Thomas Tait, Miuniki, Hood by Air, Marques’Almeida, Simon Porte
   Jacquemus, Grace Wales Bonner, Vejas Kruszewski, Marine Serre, Kozaburo
   Akasaka, Masayuki Ino, Rok Hwang, …

   Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur… DARE. This acronym resonates
   perfectly with the values of the LVMH Group: creativity and innovation,
   entrepreneurial sprit and excellence figure at the heart of this
   groundbreaking talent development program for Group employees, inspired
   by open innovation.

   Following a call for ideas sent to managers and high-potential talents
   from across the Group, 60 “idea sponsors” from 40 Maisons and 15
   countries are selected to take part in each DARE session. For three
   days, participants try out new approaches to working and collaborating
   inspired by a startup spirit and then test their entrepreneurial
   mettle.

   After a pitch session, ideas from 12 participants are selected by the
   entire group of attendees. These ideas are then taken forward by teams,
   leading up to a Grand Finale with presentations to a jury of LVMH top
   executives, joined by  entrepreneurs from outside LVMH, which names
   three winners.


   Twenty students and interns from our partner schools are also selected
   to be part of the DARE experience and join one of the 12 teams.


   Participants are supported by mentors – CEOs from LVMH Maisons and
   outside entrepreneurs – who attend all the sessions to help them refine
   their business model, test their prototype and prepare their final
   pitch. This is a unique opportunity for participants to see how their
   ideas stand up in the eyes of experienced experts.

   The three winning teams receive support from an LVMH sponsor to develop
   their project. They may also join the LVMH Maison des Startups at the
   Station F incubator.

   The DARE initiative addresses all the priorities of the LVMH Group
   around the world, from gender equity to sustainable development.
   Sessions are organized in Europe, the United States and Asia.

   LVMH created the LVMH Innovation Award in 2017 to recognize promising
   startups from France and other countries.

   The award reaffirms the importance of initiative and new ideas,
   resonating with the Group’s core values of excellence, creativity,
   innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

   The LVMH Innovation Award is open to any startup created within the
   past five years with a valuation of under $100 million, fewer than 50
   employees, and whose solutions are relevant to the challenges addressed
   by the LVMH Group and its Maisons.

   Each year 30 startups are chosen as finalists and invited to be part of
   the LVMH Lab during the Viva Technology Show in Paris, which brings
   together the game changers who are driving the digital transformation
   around the world. Co-organized by Publicis Group and media group Les
   Echos, this major event – of which LVMH is a partner – enables
   businesses that are leaders in their industry to build strong
   relationships with startups and help them grow.

   The finalists present pitches to a jury of recognized digital experts,
   which then selects the winner. The winning startup receives support and
   advice from LVMH Group investment specialists and develops a
   partnership with LVMH and its Maisons. Both the winner and the finalist
   startups selected for the LVMH Innovation Award also have an
   opportunity to join the LVMH program at the STATION F incubator.

   The startups that have won the LVMH Innovation Award since its creation
   are Heuritech (deep learning), Oyst (e-commerce solution), VeChain
   (blockchain) and Kronos Care (post-purchase solution).

   LVMH has created an accelerator program at the STATION F startup campus
   that welcomes 50 international startups each year.

   This initiative will drive co-creation by LVMH Maisons and startups to
   bring new services and innovative products to market. By launching La
   Maison des Startups in the heart of the world’s biggest startup campus,
   LVMH reaffirms its values of innovation, entrepreneurial spirit and
   excellence, the pillars that anchor the Group’s growth.

   La Maison des Startups will accelerate collaboration between LVMH
   Maisons and startups whose solutions have potential in the luxury
   industry, giving entrepreneurs privileged access to the unique
   ecosystem formed by the Group’s 70 Maisons. The program’s distinctive
   multi-sector approach enables engagement with entrepreneurs whose
   innovations are relevant to the different LVMH business groups: Wines &
   Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Perfumes & Cosmetics, Watches &
   Jewelry and Selective Retailing.

   With 89 workstations, the LVMH program at STATION F will welcome 50
   international startups each year during two six-month terms. The first
   group joined the campus in November 2017.

   Over half the startups that have joined the program were selected after
   competing for the LVMH Innovation Award at the Viva Technology show.
   LVMH managers whose projects won awards at the different editions of
   DARE LVMH, an initiative that encourages intrapreneurship in the luxury
   industry, are also invited to STATION F to launch their projects.

   In addition to a unique workspace and environment that inspire
   innovation, the LVMH program at STATION F lets entrepreneurs benefit
   from personalized coaching and support from LVMH experts. A series of
   workshops allows the startups to familiarize themselves with challenges
   facing the luxury industry, and pitch sessions are regularly organized
   to let them present the development of their solutions to
   representatives of LVMH Maisons.

   The LVMH Group launched the website WeCareForModels.com in 2018 to
   support the Charter on working relations with fashion models and their
   well-being, drawn up in September 2017 in conjunction with Kering.

   The site reiterates the commitments made by the two groups and proposes
   expert advice for fashion models from nutritionists and coaches,
   encouraging them to play an active role in shaping their profession.

   WeCareForModels.com drives momentum initiated by the Charter to promote
   responsibility, transparency and empowerment, reflecting the two
   groups’ active commitment to eliminating certain behaviors and
   practices that are not compatible with their values, while raising
   awareness among models that they have an active role to play in
   promoting these changes.

   This initiative has strong support from the CEOs and creative directors
   of houses at the two groups, as well as other industry stakeholders
   such as Elle magazine. It is designed primarily for fashion models, but
   also for all those who play a role in their working conditions and
   well-being, spanning both the world of fashion and the public.

   LVMH continually reaffirms a commitment to a diverse workforce,
   reflecting the reality of its businesses and creating an invaluable
   source of performance. This commitment to diversity inspired the
   creation of the EllesVMH en 2007.

   The EllesVMH encourages the professional development of women in all
   positions and at every level of the organization through a variety of
   initiatives.

   “Diversity is a tremendous source of complementary skills and wealth,
   making it a key success factor for LVMH and its Maisons,” says Chantal
   Gaemperle, Group Executive Vice President Human Resources & Synergies.
   “We have an amazing pool of talent at LVMH. Providing inspiring career
   growth opportunities for these ambitious women and men is essential to
   let us meet the challenges we face today and in the future.”

   In addition to the active engagement of our executives and an HR policy
   that encourages true gender diversity – spanning recruitment, training,
   pay equity, career appraisal interviews, maternity or paternity leave –
   three tangible levers have been established:
     * Actions at the Group level including training, coaching, mentoring
       and support for gender diversity programs..
     * A regional network encourages LVMH staff to take part in local
       events and initiatives tailored to the specificities of each
       market.
     * Each Maison also deploys actions aligned with its culture, values
       and strategic priorities.

   In 2013 the LVMH Group and 32 of its Maisons signed the United Nations
   Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEP). In fall 2014 the heads of LVMH
   Maisons based in the United States also signed the charter, bringing
   the total number of LVMH signatories to 41.

   Between 2007 and 2018 the percentage of women in key positions at LVMH
   rose from 23% to 42%. This puts LVMH on track to achieve its new goal
   of 50% women in top management positions by 2020.

   In 2019, LVMH Group companies with over 1,000 employees in France have
   calculated their Gender Equality Index. The consolidated score at the
   LVMH Group level is 90 points (out of 100).
