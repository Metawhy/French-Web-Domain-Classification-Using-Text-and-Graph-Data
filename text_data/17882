   When your computer is getting full, BleachBit quickly frees disk space.
   When your information is only your business, BleachBit guards your
   privacy. With BleachBit you can free cache, delete cookies, clear
   Internet history, shred temporary files, delete logs, and discard junk
   you didn't know was there. Designed for Linux and Windows systems, it
   wipes clean thousands of applications including Firefox, Internet
   Explorer, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari,and more. Beyond
   simply deleting files, BleachBit includes advanced features such as
   shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free disk space to hide
   traces of files deleted by other applications, and vacuuming Firefox to
   make it faster. Better than free, BleachBit is open source.
