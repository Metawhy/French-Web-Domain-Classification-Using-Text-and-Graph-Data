designer dad

   You could say that design was born in me a little. My Mom's degree is
   in interior design and my Dad designs roofs. He's actually pretty
   awesome. He designs them and bids on them. He used to be a lot more
   involved in the building process than that but he is unable to get on a
   roof anymore.
   The last roof he was able to stand on that he designed happened to be
   this one.
   [Exterior_F_1.jpg]
   Isn't that one beautiful copper roof!?
   Yes, my Dad designed that. It is The Grand America Hotel. It's also the
   location of Alt Design Summit. So it's been on my mind the last 24
   hours or so :)
   When I was growing up, we would take road trips to see the different
   roofs my Dad designed and built. I remember thinking it was kind of
   lame to take the always take the scenic route out of our way to see
   these buildings. Now I find myself always pointing out his handiwork to
   my family while we are in the car. Every time we go to Salt Lake we
   pass this hotel on the freeway and every time I talk about how cool
   their grandpa is.
   .......................................................................
   .................
   And just a reminder to please go LIKE and RE-PIN my little crown pin.
   I'm starting to get closer but my ticker seems to not be working past
   21 re-pins when there has been over 50. Sooooo especially if you were
   one of the first 20 pinners you might want to help me out with another
   pin. I really, really appreciate all the love and support on this
   contest. I have some great competition.
   PIN IT HERE
   THANK YOU!!!!!!!!

puffin classics

   One draw back to having all your Christmas shopping done before
   Thanksgiving isseeing something beyond awesome in December. And also
   the kids changing their minds when they see new stuff. Both problems
   were accounted for last night at Costco. The second they will get over
   but the first, I'm not so sure I will.
   When we walked through the book aisle my heart skipped a beat when I
   picked up this beautiful set of Puffin Classics.
   [42713896437400413_8F7KXIDq_c.jpg]
   Oh I wanted it bad. But, book buying is over. Of course these would be
   for my kids....maybe even more for me. I love beautiful books, it's
   even better when they are classics that I want my children to read. I
   stayed strong and walked away. We'll see if I can make it through the
   next few weeks without running back. The Costco price of $48 for the
   set might make me crazy not to. There are always birthdays to save them
   for, am I right?

obsess much: antler wreaths

   I officially want an antler wreath above my bed.
   [157977899398455409_Gsnpaljb_c.jpg]
   Love.
   And you can get a fabulous resin antler wreath for about $795 at Oly
   [antler_wreath_large.jpg]
   Or you could get the look for less at Restoration Hardware {I've never
   said that before}for $239. Even less for smaller sizes.
   [269019777712804250_VKSKqmVw_c.jpg]
   Maybe, just maybe it's something that could be a DIY??? I'm going to
   look into it.
   I'm pretty sure this needs to happen over my bed, asap.

someting strange

   Something strange happened last night. I should have been expecting it
   but I wasn't. I had just finished putting the Christmas decorations up
   and was leaving my living room. I turned around and immediately wanted
   to redecorate the one room in my home that is pretty much
   finished......uh oh.
   Suddenly I wanted to trade out all the color for a completely neutral
   palette. Maybe it was all the Christmas chaos in the room. Maybe it was
   a fluke. But there is a big part of me who wants to trade out my coral
   pillows for Keri Russell's brownstone.

   [04-keri-russell-dining-room-lgn.jpg]
   [07-keri-russell-bedroom-lgn.jpg]
   We'll see what comes of it. Definitely can't do anything until after
   the holidays. In the meantime maybe I will decorate some of the other
   rooms in my house.

prepare to deck

   I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving! My kids had the entire
   week off and we spent it with family in Utah. Thankfully, we arrived
   home safely last night. It's so nice to come home after a trip. This
   time is especially fun because I am excited to deck my halls.
   The tree goes up while the kids are at school this afternoon. I will
   rearrange my living room and set up shop so we can decorate it together
   tonight. I love decorating my tree! And my kids are more excited than
   ever this year to help so that makes it more fun.
   I am also excited to bust out my basket tree skirt I got on super
   clearance in January from Terrain. Check out this years bell shaped
   one. So cute!
   [Picture+63.png]
   After the tree is up tonight I will start wrapping because oh yes, my
   shopping was done well before Black Friday. Just the way I like it! I
   am determined to enjoy this entire Christmas season this year and I am
   already enjoying my head start :)

i love nate berkus

   I really do! And how can't you? Did you get anything from his Target
   sale? I totally missed it. Boo. But, I do really, really want his new
   book.
   [nate-berkus-book-cover.jpg]
   Until I can get my hands on a copy I will just enjoy perusing through
   his website and all the pretty spaces.
   I spied a little Beverly Hills action :)

   This one is my all time favorite room of his. Love.

   Oh Nate, you are perfection!

before and after: striped chair

   I have been anxiously waiting to show you this chair. And wouldn't you
   know when I finally can, my pictures look terrible! I dropped it off at
   my client's house last night so I can officially share it with the rest
   of the world. The before shot does not give justice to the bad shape it
   was in.
   Before
   [Boise+City-20120822-00525.jpg]
   After {which doesn't really do justice either}
   [f2d3c3a82eab11e2957722000a1f9a39_7.jpg]
   \I promise to take better shots next time I am at her house. But, dude
   this is an awesome chair. I wanted to keep it! More pictures to come,
   at least my instagram picture turned out a little.
   I fixed up a few cracks, painted it in high gloss black, and
   reupholstered it myself. And I'm only a little proud of it ;)

sewing lessons

   Last night at a church function, I won two hours of sewing lessons with
   a pro. I fought hard for it :) I knew since the same event last year
   that this was what all my points would go to. And they did. Sure I can
   sew an envelope back pillow or some crazy simple curtains. But after my
   classes I am hoping to be able to quickly sew up some fancy smanchy
   pillows with piping and a zipper. Time to bust out my 20 by 20 remnant
   of imperial trellis that I've been too afraid to touch. Woot!
   [2707213.jpg]
   If I play my cards right I am hoping I can squeeze in a lesson on roman
   shades. I would have to sew really fast to fit that in. But how awesome
   would it be to sew my own. Wish me luck. I'm so excited!
   And don't miss tomorrow. I have my favorite before and after ever to
   show you!! I have been waiting to let my client see it first and I am
   delivering it tonight. I can't wait.

MMB: beverly hills what a thrill

   Last week I had the pleasure of watching Troop Beverly Hills with my
   daughter. It was so much fun! Troop Beverly Hills is my favorite 80's
   movie. And there is some stiff competition there! I fell in love all
   over again with those yellow stripes, khaki uniforms and green berets.
   Such a good movie!
   [Troop-Beverly-Hills-Shelley-Long-9.jpg]
   And as you can see, it inspired today's mood board.

   chair / green pillow / sofa / ceramic table

i wanna be that kid

   Man, I want to be a Land of Nod kid. It's almost like Anthropologie for
   babies! Almost :) But, take a look and you will find you don't have to
   be a kid to want some of their stuff in your house.
   [big-band-rug-pink.jpg]
   Okay, maybe the rug is a little girly, but if my husband wasn't so
   manly I would totally use it somewhere.
   [poppies-and-pansies-rug.jpg]
   This one I might just use anyway...I love it!
   [heirloom-rug-pink.jpg]
   The Heirloom Rug is sure to make it's way into a current design I'm
   working on. Finally found the perfect rug!
   You know what, just look at all the rugs! They are gooood.
   I'm still super duper in love with this lamp.
   [between-a-rock-lamp-base-gold.jpg]
   Look how cozy this pendant is!
   [cardigan-pendant-cream.jpg]
   I would love a big W.
   [w-magnificent-metal-letter.jpg]
   And last week I was talking with some ladies about how no one had
   lowercase kraft letters. Wrong!
   [crafty-kraft-paper-letters.jpg]
   Anyway, it's good to be a kid!
