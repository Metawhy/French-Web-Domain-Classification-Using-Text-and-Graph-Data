Friday Fun Fact

   The rod of Asclepius is an Ancient Greek symbol associated with
   astrology and with healing the sick through medicine. It consists of a
   serpent entwined around a staff. Asclepius, the son of Apollo, was
   practitioner of medicine in Ancient Greek mythology.
   This is a great picture! Symbolizing the use of healthy foods as
   "medicine".

   Every organ in your body is affected by the food/ beverages you are
   consuming. Give them what they need, and they will be in happy
   harmony.

   An easy way to meet the whole grain requirements your body needs is to
   switch your pasta to whole grain. You can do this gradually by using
   half whole grain, and mix it with what you would normally use. Then
   make the switch completely to whole grain. It has a great flavor, and
   if you are trying to entice your kids to be healthier, this is an easy
   way to get it in their diets and even yours!

   Sometimes getting on the healthy track, means getting your body in
   shape. For many of us it is difficult and almost impossible to
   visualize end results. This website shows a model of your body before
   and after weight change (can be increase or decrease). This tool would
   be a good motivator to see what you would look like at whatever your
   goal may Be. **Remember that consuming a balanced meal is important,
   and that you should continually eat a variety of foods from each of the
   food groups each day.**
