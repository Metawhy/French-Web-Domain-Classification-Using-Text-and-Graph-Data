Welcome to CDIO!

   The CDIO™ INITIATIVE is an innovative educational framework for
   producing the next generation of engineers. The framework provides
   students with an education stressing engineering fundamentals set in
   the context of Conceiving — Designing — Implementing — Operating (CDIO)
   real-world systems and products. Throughout the world, CDIO Initiative
   collaborators have adopted CDIO as the framework of their curricular
   planning and outcome-based assessment. CDIO collaborators recognize
   that an engineering education is acquired over a long period and in a
   variety of institutions, and that educators in all parts of this
   spectrum can learn from practice elsewhere. The CDIO network therefore
   welcomes members in a diverse range of institutions ranging from
   research-led internationally acclaimed universities to local colleges
   dedicated to providing students with their initial grounding in
   engineering.
