Hello, Homestead Revival Friends!

   It's been a while, I know. Too long in fact. Thank you to everyone who
   still reads and references Homestead Revival's archives.
   The nearly 3+ year absence has been needed to re-establish our
   homestead in a new location. I took a full time job (and I do mean FULL
   time at 8-10 hours a day) when my husband went on disability, and it's
   taken some time to get to a place where I can think about writing
   again.
   And, a new season of life gives me an opportunity to write about
   something new. Therefore, I've started a new website to focus on a
   particular niche that I enjoy - planning, organization, and
   productivity at The Orderly Place. If you want to take a look, please
   stop by. As of January 2019, the pages are still a bit empty, but Lord
   willing, they will fill out little by little.

   I look forward to seeing some familiar names in the comments section!
   Blessings,
   Amy

Pie Safe Love!

   On my last post I showed you MOST of the dining area... but not all of
   it. There was one wall that was in progress. Since moving in 3 months
   ago, I moved several different pieces of furniture from around the
   house into that spot trying to find just the right thing.
   I thought I had figured it out, but when I had an opportunity to trade
   a piece of furniture I owned for a pie safe I had admired for literally
   YEARS, I jumped on the opportunity! My cohort-in-swap is just as happy
   with her end of the bargain, so it was a sweet day for all. Take a
   look...
   [Pie%2BSafe.jpg]
   Once we move into the new digs, this will hopefully have ship-lap
   siding behind it and the wire shelving will be in the laundry room.
   {{Sighhhhh...}} I'm in pie safe love!
   Thank you, W!

No Pantry? No Problem.

   So I created one...
   [IMG_4356.jpg]
   BTW... as you scroll through the photos you need to know that editing
   them takes a ton of time. So in keeping with simplifying my life, I'm
   using my iPhone, making only a few minor adjustments so you can see
   what is in the photo (light v. dark; shadows removed), and that's about
   it. And that folks, is as good as it's going to get. :-)
   [IMG_4355.jpg]
   Don't you just love my folding chairs? I know... I'm quite the trend
   setter! Truth is, we sold the big farmhouse table and chairs. And until
   I find what I want, these work just fine. I did pick up two wicker
   chair that I love! Not sure if I'll keep them at the table, but so far
   I like it.
   The dining table has been in the family since the late 1800's. I grew
   up eating all my meals on it. This one stays.
   And the light fixture? It's a rental. Some things just have to stay as
   they are. If we were living here long term, I'd swap it out temporarily
   and replace it before leaving, but probably won't do that this time
   around.
   On the plus side... I adore all these windows!! It's like having a
   sunroom. Morning light pours through and this is where I drink my
   coffee and read my bible each morning unless I'm soaking it in on the
   back patio.
   [IMG_4354.jpg]
   Anyway, back to the pantry and the reason for the post. In the last
   house, I had a HUGE walk in pantry... about 20' x 8'? I can't tell you
   how much stuff was in there, but a LOT.
   Part of our goal for selling the big house was to downsize and simplify
   our lifestyle. It's easy to become a slave to your house and it was
   swallowing us up. The rental has no pantry space at all and it's likely
   our new home won't either (still working on the plans in case we
   build). So something had to give.
   [IMG_4324.jpg]
   I sorted everything from the pantry, kitchen, and dining area that was
   in the big house and kept only what I LOVED or USED regularly. Some of
   it actually fit in our rental kitchen, but what didn't had to fit in
   the dining room on these new wire shelving racks (we opted for Trinity
   Brand EcoStorage with free Prime shipping after LOTS of research). I
   purchased an extra shelf for each and a wire basket that slides out for
   one of the racks. And ladies, I put one together by myself, so you can
   do it, too!
   [IMG_4327.JPG]
   Baskets hide things that are necessities, but aren't so lovely to look
   at... like pot lids, paper goods, stainless steel and glass water
   bottles, zip lock bags, and empty egg cartons.
   [IMG_4326.JPG]
   [IMG_4328.JPG]
   [IMG_4329.JPG]
   [IMG_4330.JPG]
   Hooks on the end hold pots, aprons, baskets, hats, etc.  LOVE this
   feature!
   [IMG_4335.jpg]
   [IMG_4351.jpg]
   I would like to report that keeping food in bulk worked well... just in
   case we had an emergency. We just couldn't rotate it fast enough to
   keep it from spoiling, despite freezing extra grains, using every
   method possible for long term storage, etc. So I decided to reduce the
   amount of food storage.
   Since I already was using the large Anchor Hocking jars for grains, I
   just decided that whatever they hold will be my limit unless I can
   squeeze some in the freezer. Each of the 2 gallon jars holds roughly 10
   lbs. of wheat, flour, rice, oats, etc. I have more in the kitchen, but
   I keep a couple on the shelves.
   [IMG_4337.JPG]
   While wire shelving isn't traditional, antique, or even rustic, it does
   have that industrial look that's so popular right not. When I travel to
   the Big City, one of my favorite places to shop is Sur La Table and
   once I was fortunate to shop at a Dean & Deluca! Now when I walk in my
   dining room, I feel like I'm right back in one of those gourmet cooking
   stores.
   [IMG_4331.jpg]
   I made one additional purchase that I had research for a LONG time. I
   invested in a quality bread box. With all the money I made selling the
   big farmhouse furniture, I was able to splurge a bit without dipping
   into our monthly budget. This Wesco bread box is a dream! I had debated
   off and on about buying a vintage granite enamel ware bread box, but my
   OCD tendency kept kicking in when I thought of storing my bread in a
   box that I had no clue as to it's prior use. I love my antiques, but a
   new bread box for me, please.
   [IMG_4340.JPG]
   Here are a few other reasons I like the open wire shelving:
   • I can see all the things I love. Like in The Sound of Music when
   Julie Andrews sings "These are a few of my favorite things...", these
   are my things that are my favorites. No more hiding behind cupboard
   doors or in a hidden pantry. It's truly out in the open. But it means I
   had to put a bit more thought into the arranging. Could I get more on
   these shelves? Of course. But why look at all the regular pantry/can
   goods when I can look at my pretty things? All that other stuff now
   fits into a couple of kitchen cabinets or in jars on the counter.
   [IMG_4341.JPG]
   • Second, it's dry here in the southwest and that means dust. More than
   most of you can ever imagine! It gets EVERYWHERE and FAST! I've thought
   of Sarah, Abraham's wife many a time and reminded myself that I COULD
   be living in a tent in the dirt and sand all my life. It helps me stay
   content with my own dust! Wire shelving collects very little dust.
   Almost none in fact. I do have to dust the items on it, but it's MUCH
   easier to manage.
   [IMG_4338.JPG]
   • Easy access... everything is within reach and a breeze to put back. I
   LOVE this about my wire shelving!
   [IMG_4342.JPG]
   • They're portable and easy to move. I can move my shelves to mop under
   them and I can take them with me to the next house. Piece of cake.
   [IMG_4343.JPG]
   • If I ever want to go back to a traditional hutch or other furniture,
   these wire racks can easily be repurchased for storing items long term
   in the garage, Costco extras, craft supplies, you name it! These won't
   make it to Craigslist anytime soon.
   [IMG_4345.jpg]
   • Modest pricing makes these affordable. Buying one a month is so much
   cheaper than a piece of furniture! And this stuff is industrial
   quality. I think every shelf holds something like 50# (don't quote
   me!).
   [IMG_4347.JPG]
   [IMG_4348.JPG]
   [IMG_4349.JPG]
   [IMG_4350.JPG]
   So there you have it. A pantry in the dining room. In the next post,
   I'll try to show you where all the REAL "pantry items" are housed.

A New Homestead Journey

   I did not expect to find myself on this path.
   Just a little over a year ago, I was a SAHM living in a big farmhouse
   and homeschooling. My husband had full time employment and we were
   planning a wedding for our oldest daughter.  On the negative side, we
   had a growing medical debt, the "farm" was weighing us down, and stress
   was growing within the family.
   How much can life change in 1.5 years? Quite a lot.
   [SOLD.jpg]
   We no longer have the big farmhouse, but a much smaller rental with
   half the amount of land and even less useable land space (and lots of
   cash in the bank!). No debt. Husband retired. Girls went back to a
   small private school. I went back to work full time. And the farm is
   now "La Petite Farm" (that should explain a lot, but will follow up
   with details in a future post).
   Thankfully, the stress has been greatly reduced and we are starting to
   find our stride in our new lifestyle. Our first grand baby is due any
   day (it's a boy!) and I while we have some general plans, nothing is
   set in stone as to what we will do next.
   However, I do know we are on a different homestead journey than
   before. No promises here, but if I can squeeze in a minute or two once
   or twice a week to journal about it here, then I'll give it a whirl.
   One thing is for sure, any blogging I do will be short and sweet,
   comments turned off, and no link ups, etc. Just one woman's quiet
   little corner of the world on the world wide web.
   So if you read Homestead Revival before and thought 1) I wish I had her
   life!, 2) I could never do that because I don't have the option to
   stay-at-home, 3) I can't afford a house and farm like that, 4) I rent,
   so I can't do any farming, 5) or any other 'ol thing that comes to
   mind.... just stay tuned. It looks a lot different around here and the
   posts on this blog will too!
   About the comments turned off... I love to read what people say! It's
   so gratifying to hear someone loves my blog or they got a great tip.
   But the truth is... it puffs up. And it takes up a lot of extra time I
   just don't have right now. So if you want to give Homestead Revival a
   shout out, thank you! Just share the blog with a friend and say a
   little prayer for us. Enough said on that.
   So... here's to a new journey! Let the story begin.

Understanding Companion Planting

   From bacteria in yogurt making to the Amazon anywhere something grows
   there is an ecosystem. As homesteaders our goal is to cultivate the
   perfect ecosystem for plants and repelling the pests that would destroy
   it. Companion planting is more than not planting cabbage where you
   planted tomatoes. It is giving your garden a healthy environment from
   soil acidity to
   succession planting.
   [Screenshot%2B2014-12-04%2B14.55.03.png]
   Ecosystems and Monocultures
   An ecosystem is a biological community of different organisms and their
   physical environment. Like the human body any ecosystem needs to
   maintain a careful balance. Too much of anything could harm it
   irreparably. In traditional agriculture monocultures are developed that
   skew the balance and cause pest and disease to take over. The
   pesticides kill the good with the bad and as the diseases become more
   virulent they use stronger pesticides.  Studies have shown the effects
   of different waves of environmental damage from monocultures. This is
   an extreme example of how important maintaining balance is.
   [Allium.jpg]
   What is Companion Planting?
   There are complicated charts and whole books about  what should be
   planted where. Each plant has its own preferences and needs which are
   provided by others. Taking the time to plan garden styles and placement
   all comedown to the details of plant placement. Taller plants can
   shelter shorter ones, space can be used more efficiently, pests can be
   repelled, and pollinators can be attracted.
   Know the Main Plant Families
   The Allium family is made up of onions, leeks, garlic, leeks, shallots,
   chives, and scallions. Brassicas include cabbage, Brussel sprouts,
   kohlrabi, and cauliflower. Some of the more well known Legumes are
   lentils, pole and green beans, and peanuts. Nightshades include
   tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and peppers. Each of these families are
   very large and include many more fruits and vegetables. The Gourd
   family includes cucumber, melons, squash, and your handy dandy luffa
   sponge. There are always exceptions, but here is the general rule.
   [Brassicas.jpg]
   Alliums like Brassica and Solanum, but dislike Legumes
   Brassicas like Alliums, but dislike Nightshades
   Nightshades like Alliums, but dislike Brassicas and Legumes
   Legumes like Nightshades and Brassicas, but dislike Alliums
   Gourds like Legumes and Alliums, but dislike Nightshades
   Some of these are so repellent you can’t plant them in the same ground
   like Brassicas and Nightshades. Others, like Legumes, are more
   selective for example bush beans like Brassicas less than they like
   Nightshades.
   [Gourds.jpg]
   2. Carrots and Beets
   Carrots and beets are from different families, but both families are
   difficult to just plant by family. Carrots are from the Apiaceae family
   which also includes parsley and celery. Alliums like Carrots, but hate
   Parsley. The similarity is the division.
   Beta vulgaris, the family that contains chard and beets, like bush
   beans, but dislikes pole beans.
   [Legumes.jpg]
   3. Radishes Drive Off Pests!
   Planting radishes near Gourds, Legumes, Brassicas, and Nightshades will
   drive off many types of beetles. It is best to let some radish go to
   seed to drive off the pests through the growing season.
   Many plants drive off pests and discourage other infestation. Potatoes
   drive off the Mexican Bean Beetle and Beans do the same for the Potato
   Beetle.
   [Nightshades.jpg]
   4. Always use Marigolds
   Not only do they drive off beetles, nematodes, and flies, but their
   roots excrete a strong natural pesticide
   This is the end of our Early Garden Planning series, so we will be
   looking at future series and other posts after Christmas.

Square Foot Gardening vs. French Intensive

   [Screenshot%2B2014-11-30%2B18.17.27.png]
   While there are many alternative methods we will discuss in future
   posts like straw bale gardening, today we are focusing on the main
   ones, Square Foot Gardening and the French Intensive Method. Each
   system is a tool that gives something to your garden like time
   management, companion planting options, and food production. They also
   leave something wanting whether it is water use or space.
   In my first garden we used raised beds to grow tomatoes and sunflowers
   at the bottom of a revine behind our house. The hill was steep and I
   remember long hikes up and down the hill to bring water and haul
   produce.  Even then we had our garden far away from our house. Raised
   beds are a staple in a high dry mountain town like ours. The dirt is
   hard and rocky for the most part and it takes years to rebuild topsoil
   eroded away. The only thing that does love the dirt are the gophers
   whose holes turn the ankles of unobservant adventurers.
   [IMGP3541-1.jpg]
   Raised beds at their simplest are a sturdy wood box with gopher wire on
   the bottom filled with clean dirt. The soil is in good condition, it
   drains well, and is easy to work with.  Season extending is made easier
   in both spring and winter by warmer soil and easily contained areas.
   Dormant weeds aren't a problem and the loose dirt makes new weeds easy
   to handle. The only draw back is the investment and periodic
   replacement.
   Square Foot Gardening
   I have used wood scraps to build a small raised bed in my front yard
   for my cold weather crops with Square Foot Gardening. The Square Foot
   Method is a way of using the raised bed space as efficiently as
   possible. We have a 4'x4' square box with twine dividing each square
   foot off. The best way to divide the box up is to use a simple wooden
   grid as seen in Amy's garden below.
   [IMGP3636-1.jpg]
   Each square can be divided even further for plants with closer spacing
   like radishes and carrots. Bigger plants like squash or cabbage take a
   full square while smaller produce is planted close together to create a
   mulch like covering for the soil preventing weed growth. Mel
   Bartholomew, the author of The All-New Square Foot Gardening Book, also
   uses a soil mix of one third peat moss, compost, and vermiculite. He
   says you should switch it out every year in order to reduce weeds and
   ensure enough nutrient for the next crop.
   [IMGP3635_2-1.jpg]
   There are drawbacks to Square Foot Gardening. Like raised beds there
   are start up and maintenance costs. Not only the materials for the
   raised beds, but also the soil, a.k.a. Mel's Mix,  which runs eight
   dollars per cubic foot.
   The biggest issue with square foot gardening is that it does not give
   back to the land around  and it drains the nutrients from the raised
   bed with no long term return. While cover crops are suggested, the
   emphasis is to continue bringing in the best, use it, and ditch it.
   This does make gardening prep easy, but it is not very responsible.
   The French Intensive Method
   The French Intensive Method is incredibly detail oriented. I like this
   one because it uses the land and feeds it with loads of compost and
   aeration. It is very water conscious and also very productive. It is
   not related to the raised bed methods and requires more patience as
   well. Like the Square Foot Method the plants are spaced so that the
   mature leaves barely touch leaving a vegetable mulch on top of the
   compost soil. Double digging came from this method where they turned
   over 24 inches of dirt for deep aeration.
   A clever combination of raised beds and the French Intensive Method was
   developed by Alan Chadwick called the Biodynamic French Intensive
   System. He includes beds planted north to south for maximum sunlight,
   careful cultivation of a luxurious green house layer, management of
   water so the plants receive just enough. Like the Square Foot Method
   beds are planted to be comfortable to reach into and everything planted
   closely together. Slim walkways only inches wide allow the beds to keep
   the right temperature and foster a warm environment. Of all of the
   methods this one is the most labor intensive involving double dug beds
   slightly raised for good drainage and, most difficult of all, the
   ability to straddle and squat over your beds while planting.
   Each system we have looked at has a unique purpose and goal. Square
   foot gardening is made to be easy on the gardener while French
   Intensive gives back to the land a lot more. I agree with Alan Chadwick
   that there is something worthwhile in both of these methods. At my
   house we double dig and then mix all of our dirt with peat moss, worm
   castings, and compost. The compost is from horse, goat and chicken
   manure and kitchen scraps. There are Square Foot Gardening years and
   French Intensive years. The most important thing is to keep growing.
   In our next post in the series we'll be talking about companion
   planting!
