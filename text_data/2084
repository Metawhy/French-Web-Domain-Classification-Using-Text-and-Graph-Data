Posted 2018-12-31FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   I am glad to finally announce the next patch release of FluxBB: version
   1.5.11.

Feature updates

     * Increase minimum password length
     * Prohibit links in topic subjects (based on existing anti-spam
       permission)
     * Allow longer SMTP passwords
     * Return correct HTTP status code on error and maintenance pages (to
       prevent search engines from indexing)
     * Prevent duplicate bans
     * User profiles: Use user's date/time formats, not the viewer's
     * Improve error message for very short searches

   Please check out the details in the full changelog. In addition, this
   release fixes nine bugs, some of which affect...

Security

     * Proper CSRF protection for rebuilding the search index, logging in
       and promoting users
     * Stop using insecure random number generator on certain PHP versions
     * Fix insufficient escaping of HTML output in installer and error
       pages

   This release has benefited from contributions by jasonrohrer, nsuchy
   and Visman. Thank you!

   I also want to thank TheBritain, Visman, Li of SEC Consult
   Vulnerability Lab and Omar Kurt of Netsparker for respectfully and
   responsibly disclosing security-relevant issues.

Project update

   As you know, this is the first release in a long time. I have decided
   to continue giving FluxBB the maintenance it deserves. However, I need
   support to achieve this. Before I announce all of my plans, as a token
   of goodwill and to regain some trust, I plan to release the
   long-awaited v1.6 within the next few weeks. This release will clean up
   some of the dusty bits under the hood of FluxBB. By removing support
   for old PHP and browser versions, we can lay the foundations to
   carefully modernize the codebase, while staying true to the spirit of
   FluxBB. This means that 1.5.11 is the last release to support PHP 4
   (which is horribly outdated). In addition, 1.6 will get some
   much-needed love in the realm of security hardening.

   With that out of the way: please go ahead and download the new version
   on the downloads page. If you are upgrading an existing forum, you can
   find instructions and resources on the upgrade page.

   Enjoy using FluxBB and stay tuned for more news on v1.6!

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi,

   I'm really sorry Franz, but, for the moment, I won't update my forum to
   1.5.11. This means I won't update the Mod Installer plugin and
   associated mods like VSABR.
   In the names of those who participated in this update, Visman appears
   and I thought some of these changes had been taken into account, but
   the parser did not change by an iota between 1.5.10 and 1.5.11, which
   means, for example, that the "create_function()" (obsolete since PHP
   7.2) have not been replaced by "function() {...}.
   At my age, I am in favour of the slightest effort, which means that I
   absolutely do not want to have to reintegrate the modifications of
   Visman's parser (which I thank very much) after having updated to
   1.5.11.
   I am the only developer of Wampserver and I already have a lot of work
   to do with it, so I try not to change my workload.

   With kind regards.

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi Otomatic,

   thanks for your comments. As mentioned above, 1.6 will be coming soon,
   which fully supports PHP 7.2.
   And no worries, I fully understand the single-developer thing. wink

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hello,

   Many thanks, the hdiff doesn't look so heavy, I think any security
   improvement is worth the upgrade.

   Fluxbb is still the best forum CMS, all I miss is php 7.2 support but
   7.1 is running fine for now wink

   Best wishes for new year coming to all of you!

   In the end, I thought I had to support the other single-developers. It
   only took me four hours to update my forum in 1.5.11, those four hours
   including the evolutions of my public and private mods and plugins.
   This is why these mods and plugins for FluxBB 1.5.11 are now available
   in Resources.

   Cheer up, single-developers! wink

   Please update Fluxbb, if you have to pay to have updates or new
   features more often as on phpbb it doesn't bother me.

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi,

   Why do you want updates often?
   A product, whatever it may be, that works well and provides the
   services for which it was designed, does not specifically need to be
   updated.
   It is to confuse innovation with progress.
   A French author, Henry de Montherlant, wrote fifty years ago:
   Today, the ideal of progress is being replaced by the ideal of
   innovation: it is not a question of being better, it is only a question
   of being new, even if it's worse than before, and that's obviously the
   case.
   And it is still relevant today.

   Hello,

   We were waiting for her, she arrived, hoping this update would restart
   the machine with the 1.6.

   Did someone apply the update and have no problems after that? No bugs?

   Well, I am trying to revive the project a bit, to provide those still

   Do you still run a FluxBB forum somewhere?

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi,

   Dear blabla, before you made any disguised advertising for PhpBB and
   quoted my message, you should have read my answer afterwards and you
   would have seen that your quotation was not necessary.

   The more shitty ads you do for any product, the less I'd want to use
   it.

   Anyway, PhpBB is much too heavy for the use I want to make of it, it's
   a real gas plant.

   You wear your nickname "blabla" very well, since you speak for nothing.

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hello and thanks for this new release. I would to know how to update
   the french translation as it appear that the last french language pack
   is for v1.5.9

   Edit: Otomatic, je peux t'aider à mettre la traduction française à jour
   si tu veux. Tu dois juste me donner la marche à suivre.

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   This is not the answer to my question. My question is : how to know
   which strings have changed since v1.5.9 ? When I know this, I could
   translate the missing files and make a pull request on github.

FluxBB is fast, light, user-friendly forum software for your website.

   choice of forum for your website.

     * Easy installation and setup
     * Open-source (GNU General Public Licence)
     * Clean administration interface
     * Flexible permission system
     * Lots of community modifications

   [ Full feature list ] [ Tour of FluxBB v1.5.11 ]

     * Download FluxBB v1.5.11

Posted 2018-12-31FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   I am glad to finally announce the next patch release of FluxBB: version
   1.5.11.

Feature updates

     * Increase minimum password length
     * Prohibit links in topic subjects (based on existing anti-spam
       permission)
     * Allow longer SMTP passwords
     * Return correct HTTP status code on error and maintenance pages (to
       prevent search engines from indexing)
     * Prevent duplicate bans
     * User profiles: Use user's date/time formats, not the viewer's
     * Improve error message for very short searches

   Please check out the details in the full changelog. In addition, this
   release fixes nine bugs, some of which affect...

Security

     * Proper CSRF protection for rebuilding the search index, logging in
       and promoting users
     * Stop using insecure random number generator on certain PHP versions
     * Fix insufficient escaping of HTML output in installer and error
       pages

   This release has benefited from contributions by jasonrohrer, nsuchy
   and Visman. Thank you!

   I also want to thank TheBritain, Visman, Li of SEC Consult
   Vulnerability Lab and Omar Kurt of Netsparker for respectfully and
   responsibly disclosing security-relevant issues.

Project update

   As you know, this is the first release in a long time. I have decided
   to continue giving FluxBB the maintenance it deserves. However, I need
   support to achieve this. Before I announce all of my plans, as a token
   of goodwill and to regain some trust, I plan to release the
   long-awaited v1.6 within the next few weeks. This release will clean up
   some of the dusty bits under the hood of FluxBB. By removing support
   for old PHP and browser versions, we can lay the foundations to
   carefully modernize the codebase, while staying true to the spirit of
   FluxBB. This means that 1.5.11 is the last release to support PHP 4
   (which is horribly outdated). In addition, 1.6 will get some
   much-needed love in the realm of security hardening.

   With that out of the way: please go ahead and download the new version
   on the downloads page. If you are upgrading an existing forum, you can
   find instructions and resources on the upgrade page.

   Enjoy using FluxBB and stay tuned for more news on v1.6!

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi,

   I'm really sorry Franz, but, for the moment, I won't update my forum to
   1.5.11. This means I won't update the Mod Installer plugin and
   associated mods like VSABR.
   In the names of those who participated in this update, Visman appears
   and I thought some of these changes had been taken into account, but
   the parser did not change by an iota between 1.5.10 and 1.5.11, which
   means, for example, that the "create_function()" (obsolete since PHP
   7.2) have not been replaced by "function() {...}.
   At my age, I am in favour of the slightest effort, which means that I
   absolutely do not want to have to reintegrate the modifications of
   Visman's parser (which I thank very much) after having updated to
   1.5.11.
   I am the only developer of Wampserver and I already have a lot of work
   to do with it, so I try not to change my workload.

   With kind regards.

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi Otomatic,

   thanks for your comments. As mentioned above, 1.6 will be coming soon,
   which fully supports PHP 7.2.
   And no worries, I fully understand the single-developer thing. wink

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hello,

   Many thanks, the hdiff doesn't look so heavy, I think any security
   improvement is worth the upgrade.

   Fluxbb is still the best forum CMS, all I miss is php 7.2 support but
   7.1 is running fine for now wink

   Best wishes for new year coming to all of you!

   In the end, I thought I had to support the other single-developers. It
   only took me four hours to update my forum in 1.5.11, those four hours
   including the evolutions of my public and private mods and plugins.
   This is why these mods and plugins for FluxBB 1.5.11 are now available
   in Resources.

   Cheer up, single-developers! wink

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi,

   Why do you want updates often?
   A product, whatever it may be, that works well and provides the
   services for which it was designed, does not specifically need to be
   updated.
   It is to confuse innovation with progress.
   A French author, Henry de Montherlant, wrote fifty years ago:
   Today, the ideal of progress is being replaced by the ideal of
   innovation: it is not a question of being better, it is only a question
   of being new, even if it's worse than before, and that's obviously the
   case.
   And it is still relevant today.

   Hello,

   We were waiting for her, she arrived, hoping this update would restart
   the machine with the 1.6.

   Did someone apply the update and have no problems after that? No bugs?

   Well, I am trying to revive the project a bit, to provide those still

   Do you still run a FluxBB forum somewhere?

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hi,

   Dear blabla, before you made any disguised advertising for PhpBB and
   quoted my message, you should have read my answer afterwards and you
   would have seen that your quotation was not necessary.

   The more shitty ads you do for any product, the less I'd want to use
   it.

   Anyway, PhpBB is much too heavy for the use I want to make of it, it's
   a real gas plant.

   You wear your nickname "blabla" very well, since you speak for nothing.

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   Hello and thanks for this new release. I would to know how to update
   the french translation as it appear that the last french language pack
   is for v1.5.9

   Edit: Otomatic, je peux t'aider à mettre la traduction française à jour
   si tu veux. Tu dois juste me donner la marche à suivre.

Re: FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   This is not the answer to my question. My question is : how to know
   which strings have changed since v1.5.9 ? When I know this, I could
   translate the missing files and make a pull request on github.

Posted 2018-12-31FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   I am glad to finally announce the next patch release of FluxBB: version
   1.5.11.

Feature updates

     * Increase minimum password length
     * Prohibit links in topic subjects (based on existing anti-spam
       permission)
     * Allow longer SMTP passwords
     * Return correct HTTP status code on error and maintenance pages (to
       prevent search engines from indexing)
     * Prevent duplicate bans
     * User profiles: Use user's date/time formats, not the viewer's
     * Improve error message for very short searches

   Please check out the details in the full changelog. In addition, this
   release fixes nine bugs, some of which affect...

Security

     * Proper CSRF protection for rebuilding the search index, logging in
       and promoting users
     * Stop using insecure random number generator on certain PHP versions
     * Fix insufficient escaping of HTML output in installer and error
       pages

   This release has benefited from contributions by jasonrohrer, nsuchy
   and Visman. Thank you!

   I also want to thank TheBritain, Visman, Li of SEC Consult
   Vulnerability Lab and Omar Kurt of Netsparker for respectfully and
   responsibly disclosing security-relevant issues.

Project update

   As you know, this is the first release in a long time. I have decided
   to continue giving FluxBB the maintenance it deserves. However, I need
   support to achieve this. Before I announce all of my plans, as a token
   of goodwill and to regain some trust, I plan to release the
   long-awaited v1.6 within the next few weeks. This release will clean up
   some of the dusty bits under the hood of FluxBB. By removing support
   for old PHP and browser versions, we can lay the foundations to
   carefully modernize the codebase, while staying true to the spirit of
   FluxBB. This means that 1.5.11 is the last release to support PHP 4
   (which is horribly outdated). In addition, 1.6 will get some
   much-needed love in the realm of security hardening.

   With that out of the way: please go ahead and download the new version
   on the downloads page. If you are upgrading an existing forum, you can
   find instructions and resources on the upgrade page.

   Enjoy using FluxBB and stay tuned for more news on v1.6!
