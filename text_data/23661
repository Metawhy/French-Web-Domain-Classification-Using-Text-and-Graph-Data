   co-Chief Scientist of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA)
   Conservation Trust, where she leads the science program for the worlds’
   largest and deepest UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a natural
   climate laboratory and which is fully closed to all commercial
   extractive activities. Rotjan is also the founder and co-Chair of the
   PIPA Scientific Advisory Committee. She is a member of Women Working
   for Oceans (W2O) and the Explorers Club, and is a Faculty Associate at
   the Boston University Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the
   Longer-Range Future. She is a member of the Board of Directors for The
   Nature Conservancy – Caribbean, and the Friends of the Middlesex Fells.

   Originally from Denver, Colorado, Brianne Dent completed her Bachelors
   of Science degree at the University of Denver in 2002. She relocated to
   Boston in 2003, where she worked as a veterinary technician and
   volunteered at the New England Aquarium.  In 2005 she joined the New
   England Aquarium full time as an Aquarist and eventually became the
   Senior Aquarist responsible for the Tropical Gallery.  She was
   responsible for caring for a variety of Indo-Pacific fish species,
   cephalopods and corals. Brianne has reared countless generations of
   cuttlefish and several generations of banggai cardinalfish (Pterapogon
   kauderni). Brianne joined the Rotjan lab in 2019 as a senior research
   technician and uses her skills as an aquarist to keep the lab running
   smoothly.

   jointly between the Rotjan Lab and the Kagan Lab (Harvard Medical
   School, Department of Virology). She recently was aboard the R/V Falkor
   in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area to collect deep sea microbes for
   her dissertation work. Her paper on fluorescent E. Coli being vectored
   into Astrangia poculata corals on microplastic beads was recently
   published. Come back to learn more about Anna. :-)  @RatherLargeNerd
   Kennedy Dive cert Brian RC Kennedy is a second year PhD student in the

   Ocean Exploration and Research working on board the NOAA Ship Okeanos
   Explorer. During his time with NOAA he served as NOAA Corps officer and
   a civilian managing ocean exploration expeditions as well as leading
   OER’s telepresence efforts. Brian’s research interest are broad,
   including but not limited to deep sea ecology, ocean exploration and
   the technology to better access and document the deep ocean, all of
   whch can be showcased in his first, first-authored paper in Frontiers
   in Marine Science! Brian has been part of the first deep-sea dives in
   both the Phoenix and Gilbert archipelagos, in collaboration with Rotjan
   and others. @BrianRCKennedy
   laura Laura DiRoberts is finishing up her time as a masters student at
   Boston University.  Laura has a BA in Marine Biology from Salem State
   University and a BS in Environmental Science from the University of
   Saint Joseph.  Prior to coming to BU, Laura interned at the Ocean
   Alliance in Gloucester, MA on the snotbot project.  Her research is
   focused on symbiotic mediation of nitrogen cycling in the temperate

   anthropogenic nutrient loading. Fun fact from Laura: David Bowie has
   always been my favorite musician, and I saw him live three times.
   Caroline Fleming is a first year masters student. She recently
   graduated from College of the Holy Cross, where she worked on the
   phenotypic plasticity of Lytechinus variegatus sea urchin larvae in
   various feeding conditions under Dr. Justin McAlister. An
   ecophysiologist at heart, Caroline has dipped her toes in population
   ecology, phylogeography, and epigenetics, and hopes to have found her
   home in investigating the dynamic energy budget of Astrangia poculata
   in the Rotjan lab. When not in the lab or riffling through the nearest
   tide pool, you can find Caroline putting her Art History minor to work,
   or hiking to the top of just about any peak she can
   find. @cflemsscientist

   various institutions on mapping and GIS projects within the Pacific and
   the Phoenix Islands. Sarah holds project experience in spatial
   analysis, custom script tools, spatial databases and a has special
   passion for cartography. While she is especially enthusiastic about
   deep sea research, her broad research interests involve geostatistics
   and 3D modeling. She enjoys spending her free time away from computer
