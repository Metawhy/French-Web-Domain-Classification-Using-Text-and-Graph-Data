   Posted on November 28, 2016 by tacsgames

   Oh no! Part way through their epic battle, the octopus and submarine

   them to work together to escape these deadly depths? To complete each
   level, you must navigate the maze without crashing. You won’t stop
   spinning so timing is everything!

Factotum Out Now (Wii U NA)

   Posted on August 20, 2015 by tacsgames

   Factotum_1016x302

   If you’re in North America, Canada, Brazil or Mexico you can download
   your copy of Factotum right now from the Nintendo e-Shop.


   You’re in deep space and something’s collided with the ship. Main power
   is offline and you’re trapped. It’s lucky you have access to this
   walker control terminal. It’s a little old but with these two robots
   and some clever thinking you might be able to get power back on-line
   and save the day.

   Control two walker robots and puzzle your way through 30 levels to
   restore power, reactivate the life support and solve the mystery of the
   collision. An unknown voice on the other end of the terminal is your
   only guide.

   Find the data-stream collectables in each level to unlock Miiverse
   stamps. Use them in the walker control terminal to call for help or
   broadcast help to others.

   Don’t forget to collect some data-streams, unlock Miiverse stamps and
   join us on Miiverse for some extra fun!

   Take flight and prove yourself in over 200 challenges across seven very
