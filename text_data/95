   freely to pass relevant data to any of the other listed companies.

   We use the services of:
     * Dropbox, Inc., a web-based file sharing services company, to share
       information between our board directors and our staff;  Dropbox,
       Inc. is registered under the ‘Privacy Shield’ arrangements; a copy
       of its registration can be found here; and

   part of our business or assets.

     * protect the rights, property, or safety of any of the companies
       listed above at 1. (Introduction), our employees, customers, or
       others.

7. Your rights

   The data protection legislation gives you a number of rights.  These
   rights include the following:
     * a right to data erasure;
     * a right to make a “subject access request”, which is a request for
       a copy of the data which we hold about you;
     * a right of correction (or, where appropriate, erasure) of data
       which we hold about you where this is inaccurate;
     * a right to data portability;
     * a right to withdraw your future consent to our processing your
       personal data;
     * a right to contact and make enquiries of our data protection
       co-ordinator, who can be contacted as follows:
          + by email: fast@fast.org ; or
          + in writing: Data Protection Co-ordinator, Federation Against
            Software Theft, 50 Station Road, Amersham, Bucks, HP7 0BD;
            and
     * a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office.

   If you exercise any of these rights, please be aware that in order to
   protect your privacy, we may require you to undergo some verification
   tests to ensure that we are dealing with you.

   You also have the right to be informed of the matters stated in this
   privacy policy.

   There are three legal bases upon which we collect, process and transfer
   your personal data, as described in this privacy policy:
     * Contract - to consider potential or to fulfil actual contracts with
       you.  If you are not able to provide this data, it is possible that
       we will be unable properly to perform our side of any contract with
       you.
     * Legitimate Interest - in order to consider potential or to fulfil
       actual contracts with you and others, we need to collect and
       process personal data about you.
     * Consent - also we may rely on your consent for us to use your
       personal data.

8. Data Retention

   We normally hold and process your data for a maximum of seven (7) years
   from the date when you last interacted with our services.  In this
   context, “interact” means being a member or enquiring about becoming a
   member.

   In any event, we will stop the processing of your data where you ask us
   to do so by contacting us at fast@.fast.org or by post to Data
   Protection Officer, Federation Against Software Theft, 50 Station Road,
   Amersham, Bucks, HP7 0BD. The only circumstances in which we will not
   do so are where we have a legal obligation or a legitimate interest to
   continue processing your data.

   Our websites and email bulletins may contain links to and from the
   websites of third parties.  If you follow a link to any of these
   websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy
   policies.  We do not set, and are not responsible for, any of those
   policies.

9. Analytic Suppliers

   By “Analytic Supplier”, we mean any company such as: Facebook, Google,
   Twitter and Microsoft. Analytic Suppliers supply us with statistical
   information on how users interact with our website to help us improve
   our user experience.

   In common with many organisations that use the internet, we
   occasionally use your personal data to help Analytic Suppliers match
   relevant advertisements to you using the data analytics of those
   Analytic Suppliers.  However, we only use the data in that way where
   you are a subscriber to the services of Analytic Suppliers and have
   therefore agreed to this service by acceding to the relevant Agreements
   of those Analytic Suppliers.

   We do not control the countries outside the United Kingdom in which any
   Analytic Supplier processes data.

   In using Analytic Suppliers we may send your data to countries outside
   the United Kingdom as explained above in 4. Storage of personal data.

10. Changes to our Privacy Policy

   Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be
   posted on this page. Please therefore check this page on a regular
   basis.  Where we make any substantial change to this privacy policy, we
   will notify you by email.
