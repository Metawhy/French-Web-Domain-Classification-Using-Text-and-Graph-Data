   I am a maître de conf&eacuterences (MdC) in algebraic geometry at the
   Institut de Math&eacutematiques de Bordeaux. I am a member of the
   Number Theory Group (&Eacutequipe de Th&eacuteorie des Nombres).

  ↝ Research

   My research interests are in birational geometry, especially
     * Fano varieties and fibrations;
     * Mori fibre spaces and minimal model program;
     * rationally simply connected varieties;
     * surfaces in positive characteristic;
     * algebraic subgroups of the Cremona group.

   During the academic year 2018/19 I was a FMJH post-doc in algebraic
   geometry at the Laboratoire de Mathématiques de Versailles, Université
   Paris Saclay, funded by the Programme Sophie Germain. I was a member of
   the Algebra and Geometry team and my supervisor there was Nicolas
   Perrin.
   In the period Sep 2016 - Aug 2018 I was a postdoc at the Mathematisches
   Institut, HHU Düsseldorf, where I was a member of the Algebra and
   Number Theory research group. My supervisor there was Benjamin Klopsch.
   During the academic year 2015/16 I was a postdoc at the Mathematisches
   Institut, Universität Basel, where I was a member of the Algebra and
   Geometry research group. My supervisor there was Jérémy Blanc.
   I obtained my PhD at the Department of mathematics, Imperial College
   London. I was a member of to the Geometry group and my supervisor was
   Paolo Cascini. During the last months of my PhD, I visited IMPA for the
   Thematic Program on Algebraic Geometry.
