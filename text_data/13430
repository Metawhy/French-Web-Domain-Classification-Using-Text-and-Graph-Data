       of Poland</span></a><br /><br />In Sep 1939, unlikely allies
       Germany and Soviet Union jointly invaded Poland, starting the war
       in Europe. Over five million would die during the German-Soviet
       invasion, the occupations, and the later Soviet invasion, which
       represented a staggering 14% of the Polish population.<br /><br

       1944, the Allies gambled on a thrust into German-held territory,
       aiming to pry an opening into the open plains of Northern Germany.
       The operation ultimately failed as the attack was too narrow and
       the long supply lines, flanks exposed, nearly broke down.<br /><br

       General William Rupertus had estimated that Peleliu in the Palau
       Islands could be taken in four days. The battle would last over two
       months, costing the Americans over 1,500 deaths and 6,000 wounded.
       The Japanese lost over 10,000 killed.<br /><br /><a
