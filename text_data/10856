Getting Started

   Framadrop is a free (as in free speech) online service to share files
   in a confidential way.
    1. If needed you can choose a delay of online availability.
    2. Paste the file to share.
    3. Then share the given link with your contacts.

   Your images are encrypted and hosted on our server and we have no means
   to decrypt them.

   If you need help to use this program, here is a video tutorial courtesy
   of arpinux, a kind guide to newcomers on HandyLinux GNU/Linux distro.

The software

   Framadrop is derived from Lufi software created by Luc Didry

   Lufi is under the free license AGPL.

   The sources of Framadrop are available on our software forge

   This site works very well with Firefox and Chrome, but not well on
   Safari and not at all on Internet Explorer.

Grow your own

   If you want to contribute to development, patch or suggest improvements
   or simply download, just hop on Development site.

   If you wish to install your own instance and be independent from the
   online service, we can help you on:
