What is Helpdesk Office®?

   Helpdesk Office® is a Business-to-Business (B2B) and
   Business-to-Consumer (B2C) customer service software for small
   businesses.

Why is Helpdesk Office® best for small businesses?

   Small businesses are the bloodstream of the United States economy.
   Every year they generate over 1 million net new jobs. Yet, they face
   many obstacles that prevent their growth, such as lack of financial
   capital, know-how, and data security. These are some of the many
   reasons why millions of small businesses cease to exist each year. For
   example, did you know that over 50% of small businesses do not adopt
   new technology because it's too expensive, 25% because it's too
   complicated, and over 60% never reopen after a cyber attack? Helpdesk
   Office® was developed from the ground up having a small business in
   mind, so Helpdesk Office® is affordable, simple, and secure.

How can Helpdesk Office® help your business grow?

   Helpdesk Office® makes your customer service easy, improves user
   experience, and increases productivity.

Simple

   Ease of doing business gives you more time to focus on your customers
   and business growth. Helpdesk Office® has a simple and intuitive
   interface which facilitates smooth software integration into your
   business processes. It provides an exceptional user experience for your
   customers and employees by creating a joyful and productive
   environment.

Secure

   Security breaches are among the biggest threats to a small business.
   Many small businesses never reopen after a cyber attack due to lost
   revenues and customer damages. Helpdesk Office® is integrated with
   Cloudflare and it uses the latest encryption to protect your data in
   transit and at rest.

Affordable

   Lack of financial capital is the single largest threat to a small
   business. Being a small business, we understand that high prices
   prevent many from having great software, thus Helpdesk Office® is
   affordable!
