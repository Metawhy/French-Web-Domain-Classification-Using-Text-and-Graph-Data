Chart of the Day:A comparison benchmark of add-to-basket rates with
conversion rates?

   Do you call it add-to-cart or add-to-basket? It depends where you are
   based - cart is most common in the United States, basket is more common
   in the UK and Australia.

   Regardless of what you call it, adding an item to the cart is an
   important micro-conversion step to measure and benchmark for retailers.
   While it is common to compare conversion rates, naturally this measures
   the efficiency of the overall process including both category or
   product views, basket adds and checkout.

   Add-to-basket rates give additional information about how appealing
   individual products are based on description and visuals on the product
   page. It shows intent to purchase by interactions with the site (Act in
   the Smart Insights RACE Planning conversion funnel). Google has several
   definitions in its Enhanced Ecommerce tracking and they neatly avoid
   the use of basket or cart. These measures include:
     * Product Adds (to carts)
     * Product Removes (from carts)
     * Cart-to-Detail Rate (number of products added per number of
       product-detail views)

   Of course, the overall conversion may take place over several sessions
   in practice.

What is an add-to-cart conversion rate?

   As with all KPIs, we have to be careful to define add-to-basket rates
   since it can vary by the type of analytics system you're using. As with
   Ecommerce conversion rates, it can be stated as the ratio of adds to
   visitor sessions or unique visitors. Because of the difficulty in
   identifying unique visitors, it's common, as with Google Analytics to
   measure conversion to visitor sessions. We also have to think whether
   it's based on views of the basket or cart rates, or clicks on the
   button. Since it's easier to measure clicks, it's generally the case
   that it's based on button clicks, but that does vary by system.

   So we can define add-to-cart conversion rate as:

     The percentage of visitors sessions to a website that involve a
     click on the add-to-cart or add-to-basket buttons.

Average add-to-cart rates by device

   Unfortunately Google doesn't publish average add-to-cart rates, but
   fortunately, there is a good source in the regularly updated Monetate
   Ecommerce research benchmarks.

   The most recent compilation from Monetate shows that:
     * The average add-to-cart rate is 10.9% (amongst their customers)
     * Add-to-cart is slightly  lower on smartphone (9,4%) compared to
       desktop (12.5%)
     * Tablet rates are simila to desktopr, but slightly lower than
       desktop (10.3%)
     * Conversion rates overall are at roughly one-third of this rate
       (3.3% in Q3)

   The lower add-to-cart rate on smartphone compared to desktop is similar
   to the pattern for retail conversion rates, but with less difference -
   conversion rates to sale on smartphone is around half that on desktop.
   Why is this? Well it has to be a combination of user preference to
   purchase on desktop and usability challenges on smartphone. Perhaps the
   difference between the United States and UK in the chart shows how this
   can be optimised. Closer similarity in add-to-cart rates perhaps shows
   people are adding to basket on smartphone and then completing sale on
   desktop. A theme explored in the Monetate research for Q4 2017.

   Ecommerce conversion rates, it can be stated as the ratio of adds to
   visitor sessions or unique visitors. Because of the difficulty in
   identifying unique visitors, it's common, as with Google Analytics to
   measure conversion to visitor sessions. We also have to think whether
   it's based on views of the basket or cart rates, or clicks on the
   button. Since it's easier to measure clicks, it's generally the case
   that it's based on button clicks, but that does vary by system.

   So we can define add-to-cart conversion rate as:

     The percentage of visitors sessions to a website that involve a
     click on the add-to-cart or add-to-basket buttons.

Average add-to-cart rates by device

   Unfortunately Google doesn't publish average add-to-cart rates, but
   fortunately, there is a good source in the regularly updated Monetate
   Ecommerce research benchmarks.

   The most recent compilation from Monetate shows that:
     * The average add-to-cart rate is 10.9% (amongst their customers)
     * Add-to-cart is slightly  lower on smartphone (9,4%) compared to
       desktop (12.5%)
     * Tablet rates are simila to desktopr, but slightly lower than
       desktop (10.3%)
     * Conversion rates overall are at roughly one-third of this rate
       (3.3% in Q3)

   The lower add-to-cart rate on smartphone compared to desktop is similar
   to the pattern for retail conversion rates, but with less difference -
   conversion rates to sale on smartphone is around half that on desktop.
   Why is this? Well it has to be a combination of user preference to
   purchase on desktop and usability challenges on smartphone. Perhaps the
   difference between the United States and UK in the chart shows how this
   can be optimised. Closer similarity in add-to-cart rates perhaps shows
   people are adding to basket on smartphone and then completing sale on
   desktop. A theme explored in the Monetate research for Q4 2017.
