WALL CHARTS ON THE WALL B+W

   I HAD TO WAIT FOUR DAYS BEFORE MY WALL CHARTS COULD BE PRINTED IN
   COLOUR, BUT I DID GET SOME BLACK AND WHITE COPIES TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD
   LOOK ON THE WALL AND ALSO TO HAVE A PROPER LOOK AT THE HEADINGS. IN THE
   PICTURES BELOW THE IMAGES ON THE RIGHT HAVE THE HEADING REMOVED.
   I DID THIS BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE
   WORK, BUT DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE BEING USED FOR EDUCATIONAL
   PURPOSES, A HEADING IS NECESSARY.

WORK IN PROGRESS PHOTOGRAPHS

   THESE WERE PICTURES I TOOK OF THE WALL CHARTS BEFORE PRINTING. ALL THE
   COMPONENT PIECES WERE LAID OUT WITH THE TEXT BEFORE BEING STUCK DOWN.
   IN THESE PICTURES THE WALL CHARTS STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL TEXT WHICH
   WAS LATER CHANGED DUE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROJECT. THESE DO
   HOWEVER, GO SOME TO GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF THE COLOUR AND BASIC LAY OUT:
   PEASANTS:
   NOBLES:
   WAR:

MEDIEVAL FOOD

   A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE AND INTERESTING WEBSITE ABOUT MEDIEVAL FOOD AND
   THE DEPENDANCE ON CLASS AS TO WHAT FOOD YOU ATE:
   http://www.medieval-life.net/food.htm
   THIS IS A WEBSITE THAT IS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT HISTORY FOR CHILDREN.
   IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR ME TO SEE HOW THEY WRITE ABOUT FOOD FOR CHILDREN,
   AS IT MIGHT GIVE ME IDEAS ABOUT THE TONE MY WORKSHEETS SHOULD TAKE,
   THIS IS HOW THEY TALK ABOUT MEDIEVAL FOOD:

  JOUSTING

   THE NOBLES ALSO WATCHED JOUSTING COMPETITIONS AS A FORM OF
   ENTERTAINMENT. THERE WERE FEW WARS DURING THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD AND
   KNIGHTS NEEDED WAYS TO STAY FIT AND PRACTICE THEIR COMBAT SKILLS WHILE
   THERE WAS PEACE.
   JOUSTING COMPETITIONS REQUIRED GREAT HORSE SKILLS AS WELL AS COMPETENT
   SKILLS WITH WEAPONS, WITH THE OBJECT OF THE JOUST BEING TO KNOCK YOUR
   OPPONENT OFF OF HIS HORSE USING A LONG POLE CALLED A LANCE.
   THEY WOULD FIGHT IN THE HONOUR OF A LADY, OFTEN THE WIFE OR DAUGHTER OF
   A NOBLE.
   THEY WOULD CHOOSE THEIR OPPONENT BY THEIR HERALDRY I.E COAT OR
   ARMS/SHEILD

  MEDIEVAL BANQUETS AND ENTERTAINMENT

   MEDIEVAL JESTERS:
   JESTERS WERE USED TO ENTERTAIN THE NOBILITY DURING THE EVENINGS AND
   WERE ALSO KNOWN AS CLOWNS, BUFFOONS OR FOOLS.

   MEDIEVAL MUSIC / MUSICIANS:
   MUSIC ALSO PLAYED A BIG PART IN THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE NOBLES.
   INSTRUMENTS AROUND IN THE EARLY MEDIEVAL ERA WERE:
   WOODEN FLUTE
   RECORDER
   PAN FLUTE (PAN PIPES)
   LUTE
   MANDORA (SMALL GUITAR/LUTE)
   PSALTERY (STRINGED INSTRUMENT - HARP FAMILY)

  DEFENSE

   A SIGNIFICANT PART OF A NOBLES DAY WAS TAKEN UP WITH PRACTISING HIS
   SKILLS WITH THE LONGBOW, SWORD OR HUNTING (WHICH WOULD ALSO IMPROVE HIS
   HORSE RIDING AND COMBAT SKILLS). BUT HE ALSO HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS
   CASTLE WAS SAFE AGAINST ATTACK, WHICH INVOLVED A SERIES OF DIFFERENT
   THINGS THAT WOULD EITHER FRIGHTEN PEOPLE OR ATTEMPT TO KILL THEM OR
   BOTH.
   THESE WERE PICTURES I TOOK AT MOUNTFITCHET, WHICH I HAVE BEEN USING AS
   REFERENCE:
   WATCH TOWER:
   LARGE CATAPULT (NEAR THE BACK OF THE CASTLE WALLS - LARGE STONES):
   SMALL CATAPULT (FRONT OF THE CASTLE WALLS - SMALL STONES AND DEBRIS):
   THE CASTLE BOUNDARIES:
   THE MOAT SURROUNDING THE CASTLE WAS A DRY MOAT (NO WATER) WITH
   SHARPENED STICKS IN IT SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET IMPALED IF THEY TRIED
   TO CHARGE THE CASTLE:
   THE MAIN GATE (HAD THE SHIELD SO THAT PEOPLE KNEW WHO'S CASTLE IS WAS.
   SAME WITH THE FLAGS. ALSO THE SEVERED HEADS OF CAPTURED ATTACKERS WERE
   PUT ON STICKS TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE OFF!)
