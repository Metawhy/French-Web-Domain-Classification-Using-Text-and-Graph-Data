UPDATE #3

   aupaysdesmerveillesblog.be After a very long break, it’s finally time
   to pick up blogging again.  As of thursday, you’ll be able to find me
   at aupaysdesmerveillesblog.be for more beautiful interiors, more
   interesting places in wonderful cities, more inspiring people, more
   amazing architecture and more pretty things.  (No more Things that make
   me smile posts though, but you can still go through my archives here or
   find new additions on this pinterest board, and no more images of other
   photographers and artists, but you can still find those on my tumblr.)
   This blog will disappear (but no worries, I’ve transfered all posts to
   my new website and this url will redirect there as well), so make sure
   to update your links to aupaysdesmerveillesblog.be!

   In the meantime you can stay up to date through facebook, instagram or
   twitter and I’m hoping to see you at aupaysdesmerveillesblog.be on
   Thursday, now it’s back to work to get everything up and running!

UPDATE #2

   Schermafbeelding 2015-02-25 om 11.25.12

   A long long time ago, I promised a room tour… and here it is!  Not on
   this blog, but over at the ikea family live magazine! You can find it
   in dutch here and in French here.  No English, but it’s mostly pictures
   anyway.  These pictures were taken in the summer, so obviously things
   have already changed a lot here (for example, I have an actual bed
   now!), but I’m still pretty happy with the result of this article.  And
   there’s more good news: if everything goes according to plan, I should
   be able to start on the new Au Pays Des Merveilles next week and
   hopefully I’ll be back soon with more pretty things, more interior
   inspiration and more travel tips!

   In the meantime, stay up to date through facebook, instagram and
   twitter, and you’ll be the first to know when Au Pays Des Merveilles is
   back!

UPDATE

   AU PAYS DES MERVEILLES UPDATE

   Almost 4 months ago I announced that I’d be taking a break from
   blogging until I would graduate one month later… Today that diploma is
   in my hands, but I’m not blogging again just yet.  I’ve been working
   hard the past months, doing student jobs for a last time but also as an
   intern for Baroness O.  That ended about week ago and now I’m doing
   some freelance photography jobs while looking for a day job.  But
   first, I’m taking a well deserved vacation to Barcelona!  After that,
   the relaunch of Au Pays Des Merveilles is the first thing on my agenda
   and I am really looking forward to start blogging again!

   It’s been quiet here, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been active in
   the blogosphere.  I’ve already been preparing some content for the new
   Au Pays Des Merveilles, but I’ve also been active on some other blogs.
   During the last week before my graduation, I kept a photo diary for
   Laura Pauline K. which you can find here, while this week I am guest
   blogging for Antwerpen Streetstyle, showing you the most fashionable
   architects and the most remarkable architecture in the city.  (My first
   post is already online here!) You can also find a some of my photos
   from Interieur Kortrijk on the Baroness O. blog, here, here and here.
   (And if you didn’t see them yet, make sure to check out the DIY’s that
   we designed for Interieur Kortrijk here!)  If you’re curious to see
   what I’m up to, you can follow me on facebook, instagram and twitter,
   where I’ll keep you up to date on the relaunch of the blog and the next
   guest posts for Antwerpen Streetstyle.

   See you soon!

TAKING A BREAK

   hannelore veelaert via au pays des merveilles

   photo by me

   You’ve probably noticed it’s been a lot more quiet here in the past few
   months than usually.  There’s two reasons for that.  First, I’m
   graduating in a month and most of my time has been going towards
   finishing my thesis.  Also, I’ve been thinking a lot about where I want
   to go with this blog and I’m slowly figuring out what Au pays des
   merveilles should be all about.  Being so busy for university, I
   haven’t had the time yet put my ideas into reality and it feels a bit
   awkward posting here while in my head I’m planning a total makeover for
   this blog.  So, considering everything that is going on right now, it
   seems like the perfect time to take a break and focus on finally
   getting my hands on that diploma.   I’m super excited for what’s to
   come!  Even though right now my future plans exist only in my head, I
   want to do it right and therefor I’m putting the blog on hold so I can
   come back in full force somewhere in September.  In the meantime, you
   can still follow me on facebook, instagram, pinterest, tumblr and
   twitter, as sharing my photos and things I’m inspired by is just
   something I can never let go.  So, wish me good luck and see you in
   September!

PLAYLIST #3: WHIZ

   whiz' playlist via au pays des merveilles

   Last week, I shared the photos I took of Whiz while they were
   recording.  I asked them to compose a playlist with their biggest
   musical heroes and most important influences, to give you an idea of
   what they sound like.  I’ll leave it up to these nine tracks to
   convince you of their great taste in music, so enjoy! Continue reading

WHIZ

   whiz recordings by hannelore veelaert via au pays des merveilles

   A few months ago, Whiz (former Roadburg and The Galacticos) invited me
   into their studio to take some photos while they were recording their
   album with Koen Gisen (also known as An Pierlé’s White Velvet).
   Somehow I didn’t get around sharing these photos, but this seemed like
   the perfect timing to introduce them on the blog.  Now that the
   festival season started, the band is doing a few concerts so head on
   over to their facebook page for more info.  To give you a sense of what
   they sound like, the boys have composed a playlist of their musical
   heroes.  Check back here on Monday to hear their influences!

   By the way, this is exactly the kind of photography job that I love:
   people doing their thing while I can observe and try to capture the
   atmosphere.  (The space being dark and quite small, it wasn’t the
   easiest task with the limited material I have, but in the end it didn’t
   turn out so bad.)  I can’t wait to have more time on my hands again to
   photograph!  Chop chop, back to work now. Continue reading →

PRETTY THINGS: tote bags

   pretty things tote bags via au pays des merveilles

   My daily bag is most definitely a canvas tote.  Whether you need to
   bring just your daily necessities, do some groceries on the way home or
   bring an extra sweater: it always fits and it’s never too bulky.
   There’s just one problem: they don’t last a very long time.  Now that
   my favorite tote bag (I’m talking about the white version of the “my
   bauhaus is better than yours” tote from this post, which already
   replaced the black version) has  developed holes big enough for my keys
   to fit through, it’s time to think about replacement.  I’ve been
   keeping an eye out for a pretty substitute and I’ve gathered my finds
   here.  Number 2 is probably my favorite, although I have a hard time
   picking just one.  (Especially when I look back at this post from two
   years ago, where number 4 and number 6 caught my attention again.)
   Which one would you pick?  (And feel free to share if you found other
   great designs!) Continue reading →

       Mooie kamer heb je! Mij hebben ze ook gecontacteerd voor zo’n
       fotoreeks, maar ik heb toch maar gepast, ik ben nogal perfectionist
       en wil dat alles er zou uitzien ‘gelijk de boekskes’. Onmogelijke
       opdracht hier, die jou wel gelukt is!
       Benieuwd naar de nieuwe blog!

   AU PAYS DES MERVEILLES UPDATE

   Almost 4 months ago I announced that I’d be taking a break from
   blogging until I would graduate one month later… Today that diploma is
   in my hands, but I’m not blogging again just yet.  I’ve been working
   hard the past months, doing student jobs for a last time but also as an
   intern for Baroness O.  That ended about week ago and now I’m doing
   some freelance photography jobs while looking for a day job.  But
   first, I’m taking a well deserved vacation to Barcelona!  After that,
   the relaunch of Au Pays Des Merveilles is the first thing on my agenda
   and I am really looking forward to start blogging again!

   It’s been quiet here, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been active in
   the blogosphere.  I’ve already been preparing some content for the new
   Au Pays Des Merveilles, but I’ve also been active on some other blogs.
   During the last week before my graduation, I kept a photo diary for
   Laura Pauline K. which you can find here, while this week I am guest
   blogging for Antwerpen Streetstyle, showing you the most fashionable
   architects and the most remarkable architecture in the city.  (My first
   post is already online here!) You can also find a some of my photos
   from Interieur Kortrijk on the Baroness O. blog, here, here and here.
   (And if you didn’t see them yet, make sure to check out the DIY’s that
   we designed for Interieur Kortrijk here!)  If you’re curious to see
   what I’m up to, you can follow me on facebook, instagram and twitter,
   where I’ll keep you up to date on the relaunch of the blog and the next
   guest posts for Antwerpen Streetstyle.

   See you soon!
