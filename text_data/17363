                                     HOR
              International Workshop on Higher-Order Rewriting
     __________________________________________________________________

   Workshop Topics
   The aim of HOR is to provide an informal and friendly setting to
   discuss recent work and work in progress concerning higher-order
   rewriting.
   HOR is a forum to present work concerning all aspects of higher-order
   rewriting. The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics for the
   workshop:
     * Applications: proof checking, theorem proving, generic programming,
       declarative programming, program transformation.
     * Foundations: pattern matching, unification, strategies, narrowing,
       termination, syntactic properties, type theory.
     * Frameworks: term rewriting, conditional rewriting, graph rewriting,
       net rewriting, comparisons of different frameworks.
     * Implementation: explicit substitution, rewriting tools, compilation
       techniques.
     * Semantics: semantics of higher-order rewriting, higher-order
       abstract syntax
