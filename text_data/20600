Street Corn Avocado Toast

   Street corn avocado toast is an easy meal and totally acceptable any
   time of the day!

   I have an avocado toast problem.

   But I guess I don’t see it as a “problem.” What’s problematic about
   healthy fats spread on whole-grain toast?

   time of the day!

   NOTHING.

   As you probably already know, avocado toast is a staple at our house,
   so I’m always looking for ways to mix it up. Topping it with eggs and
   cheese is standard and definitely one of my favorite ways to
   have avocado toast, but I also love it with everything bagel seasoning,
   togarashi, a drizzle of tahini, fresh cucumbers… Ok, with just about
   anything. (It also makes frequent appearances on instagram!)

   And I definitely like avocado toast with traditional street corn
   flavors. Think about it. Roasted corn, fresh lime juice, a bit of spice
   from chili powder, and salty cojita (or feta!) cheese. All atop creamy
   avocado…we have alllll of the bases covered. Creamy, crunchy, salty,
   sweet, acidic, spicy.

   And it’s easy. Which is definitely my favorite type of recipe.

   And it’s versatile. Sound good for breakfast? Go for it. Need a quick
   lunch? Perfect. Looking for a no-cook summer dinner? Done.
