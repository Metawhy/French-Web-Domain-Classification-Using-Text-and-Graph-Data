Paintings by Richard Ahnert

     Toronto-based artist Richard Ahnert takes anthropomorphic painting
     to a new level, lacing it with a quiet, yet unmistakable animism -
     an abiding kinship between human and animal.

     Richard graduated with honors from the Arts York Program at
     Unionville HS with a Major in Visual Arts and went on to study
     Technical Illustration and Graphic Design at York University and
     Seneca College, graduating with the Presidents Honor Roll for
     Highest Academic Achievement.

   To say I am behind the curve with reading this year is a massive
   understatement. To say I am behind the curve as pertaining to blogging
   and photos would be putting it politely.
   .
   .
   2018 has been a year of reflection and rearranging my priorities to
   better suit my mental health. Early in the year I made the decision to
   let social media has fall by the wayside and spend more time being
   present in reality. This decison has lead to remarkable improvement in
   many areas in my daily life. So, as I put a close to the end of a year
   dedicated to healing and mental health it is only fitting that my
   favorite book this year has been Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by
   Gail Honeyman.
   .
   May your 2018 go out with a whisper and your 2019 begin with a roar.

City Lights is hiring a new floor manager

   citylightsbooks:

     image

     City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco is looking to hire a Floor
     Manager/Bookseller. This Floor Manager will work in conjunction with
     the General Manager to ensure the smooth operation of the bookstore.
     While the General Manager oversees the operations of the bookstore
     as a whole, the Floor Manager will coordinate the day’s activities
     on the floor: supervising all bookstore staff, directing workflow,
     assuring books are getting received and shelved in a timely manner,
     attending to customers, troubleshooting computer issues and
     attending to facilities needs.

     The Floor Manager is also expected to take initiative to propose
     systems improvements, new projects (e.g. a more thorough
     new-employee training program, inventory control, etc.), and
     possible improvements to the overall workplace environment.

     The Floor Manager will report directly to the General Manager and
     will sit in on management meetings on a regular basis.

     The Floor Manager will serve as a conduit between the management and
     the bookstore staff. It will be the Floor Manager’s role to help
     convey to the staff initiatives directed by Management. The Floor
     Manager will also communicate staff concerns, recommendations and
     problems directly to management.

     AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE
