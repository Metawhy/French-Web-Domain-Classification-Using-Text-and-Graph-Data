ABSTRACT

   ABSTRACT

   In contrast to its popularity, astonishingly few facts have become
   known about the biology of the Goliath Frog, Conraua goliath. We herein
   report the so far unknown construction of nests as spawning sites by
   this species. On the Mpoula River, Littoral District, West Cameroon we
   identified 19 nests along a 400 m section. Nests could be classified
   into three types. Type 1 constitutes rock pools that were cleared by
   the frogs from detritus and leaf-litter; type 2 constitutes existing
   washouts at the riverbanks that were cleared from leaf-litter and/or
   expanded, and type 3 were depressions dug by the frogs into gravel
   riverbanks. The cleaning and digging activities of the frogs included
   removal of small to larger items, ranging from sand and leaves to
   larger stones. In all nest types eggs and tadpoles of C. goliath were
   detected. All nest types were used for egg deposition several times,
   and could comprise up to three distinct cohorts of tadpoles. Nests
   seemed to be clustered. Camera trapping revealed that nests are guarded
   by adult frogs at night. The breeding nests may allow the frogs to
   deposit their eggs away from the torrent rivers, and potential egg and
   tadpole predators. As nest construction, at least in some cases,
   requires the removal of large and heavy items, we hypothesize that this
   can only be achieved by decent sized frogs, possibly explaining the
   unique size of the species.

Introduction

   Amphibians have evolved the most diverse reproductive strategies of all
   terrestrial vertebrates (Duellman and Trueb 1986 Duellman WE, Trueb L.

   and behavior of Amphibians. Chicago: Chicago University Press; p.

   still discovered (e.g. Iskandar et al. 2014 Iskandar DT, Evans BJ,
   McGuire JA. 2014. A novel reproductive mode in frogs: a new species of
   fanged frog with internal fertilization and birth of tadpoles. PLoS

   living species, the Goliath Frog, Conraua goliath (Boulenger, 1906

   G.L. Bates in South Cameroon. Ann Mag Nat History. 17:317–323.

   along streams in lowland and mid-altitude rainforest from southwestern
   Cameroon into Equatorial Guinea (IUCN 2019 IUCN SSC Amphibian

   threatened species 2019: e.T5263A96062132. Downloaded on 02 April
   2019. [Google Scholar]; Figure 1). In contrast to its degree of
   popularity, astonishingly few facts have become known about its
   biology. Previous studies address the taxonomy of the species (Lamotte
   and Perret 1968 Lamotte M, Perret J-L. 1968. Révision du genre Conraua

   of the Bakossi people around mount Manengouba, Cameroon, with special
   consideration of the hairy frog, Trichobatrachus robustus. Salamandra.
   44:23–34. [Google Scholar]), but very little is known about its
   reproductive biology and behavior. One study, Sabater-Pi (1985

   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), reported
   details concerning the larval development and some aspects of the
   species’ reproduction; however, without mentioning any kind of parental
   care. During recent field work, we have been repeatedly informed by
   local Goliath Frog hunters, that this species constructs nests for egg
   deposition and guards the tadpoles. We thus decided to improve
   knowledge surrounding the reproductive biology of C. goliath and
   investigate whether these frogs exhibit nest construction and parental
   care.

Material and methods

   From February to May 2018 we repeatedly searched a 400 m long section
   (4°38ʹ15ʺN, 9°43ʹ07ʺE to 4°38ʹ25ʺN 9°43ʹ9ʺE) along the Mpoula River
   near the city of Penja, Littoral District, western Cameroon (app. 200 m
   a.s.l.), for Goliath Frog nesting sites (Figure 2). Mpoula River
   comprises very different habitats. Very turbulent rocky sections of the
   river, not wider than 5 m with cascades and small waterfalls of 20 to
   120 cm height, could be followed by calm sandy areas of more than 50 m
   width and less than 10 cm water depth; or deep (> 1.5 m) stagnant,
   muddy sections. Most of the original gallery forest has been converted
   into small plantations and gardens, and a banana plantation nearly
   reaches the riverbed. Only on very steep sections of the river bank,
   gallery forest still persists. During our survey we witnessed ongoing
   slash and burn clearing of remaining forest parts, as well as pesticide
   spraying by airplane (plantation) and hand-pumps (villagers).

   In total we surveyed this section on 12 days, searching for new
   breeding sites and assessing the use in already known sites. During
   four nights we focused on behavioral observations. Searching for
   breeding sites was conducted by two people, wading in parallel along
   both banks. Potential nests were initially identified by the presence
   of C. goliath tadpoles or eggs (Figure 5(b,c)). After we learned what
   to look for, we identified and registered all similarly structured
   sites, regardless of eggs or tadpoles’ presence. In order to
   distinguish nests from non-nests; i.e. when concerning rock pools and
   water-filled depressions in sandbanks, we checked if these places had
   been apparently cleared from leaf-litter and other detritus, and if the
   excavated material piled up at the edges (and looked different to what
   would be expected to be caused by the water current). The structure,
   position, diameter and maximum depth of any potential nest was
   recorded. During each visit of the area each nest was checked for the
   presence of eggs, tadpoles, distinct tadpole size classes, predators,
   water depth and temperature. For spatial analysis of nest clusters, GPS
   coordinates were Z transformed and the k means clusters computed using
   R software version 3.4.3.

   For the nocturnal observations, we focused on the nesting site that
   showed the most recent changes between the last and the respective
   actual day visit. In particular, we decided to surveil one nest (#16;
   Figures 2 and 5(a)) with a 16-megapixel, low-glow infrared camera trap
   (BestoU®, Model 16). After realizing that the motion detector, 3 m from
   the nest, was not sensitive enough to record apparent frog activities,
   we decided to use the time-lapse option of the camera, taking pictures
   every 20 seconds, starting from shortly before nightfall for a duration
   of 11 h. The camera was positioned approximately 1.4 m above water
   level and 3 m from the nest.

   In addition, we interviewed three local frog hunters and one frog
   hunter from the Nkongsamba region, as well as two villagers, having
   their gardens on the shore of the Mpoula River, for their knowledge on
   C. goliath breeding habits.

Results

Nest numbers, sites and characteristics

   From February 27 to May 5, we recorded a total of 22 sites along the
   river (Figure 2), which were used by Goliath Frogs as breeding sites.
   Identification of these sites was due to the above-mentioned criteria.
   Seven sites were found on the first day, and another nine on the second
   visit. Two more sites were detected on the third visit and another
   three on the fourth. Lastly, one site was identified on the eleventh
   visit (Table 1). Nineteen of these sites were round to oval
   water-filled depressions (mean maximal depth 9.1 ± 2.1 cm) not
   exceeding 140 cm in diameter (mean diameter 102.8 ± 14.5 cm). Three
   sites were smaller, measuring <60 cm in diameter (Table 1), showing all
   above mentioned features, but were never (during our survey) completed
   or used as nests.

   The origin and structure of the nest sites allowed them to be grouped
   into three types (Figure 3). Type 1 (Figure 3(a)) comprised rock-pools
   (N = 2), situated on larger rock faces within the river bed. Thus frogs
   were using pre-existing structures for breeding. Eggs or tadpoles
   revealed the identity as nest; however, the lack of leaf-litter and
   other organic sediments, especially in respect of the near surrounding,
   was striking. Type 2 nests (N = 14; Figure 3(b)) were naturally
   existing washouts or shallow pools close to the river bank, which
   seemed to have been enlarged by the frogs and again were cleared from
   sediments such as leaf-litter. Similarly, type 3 nests (N = 6; Figures
   3(c)) and 5(a)) were shallow water filled depressions with gravel or
   sandy ground, encircled by larger stones and rocks. The uniform
   structure of small gravel or sand in the center, lacking any other
   larger stones (only massive rocks remained) but surrounded by large
   stones, some of them quite apparently being moved recently (stones
   turned up-side-down as visible from surfaces apparently being formerly
   in the ground and now exposed and vice versa) indicated that these
   nests had been created by the frogs, pushing the stones to the edges
   (some of the moved stones having a weight of up to 2 kg).

   One main aspect that all nests had in common was that the substrate
   seems to have been cleaned, because leaf-litter and other detritus were
   absent from these sites. Other similarly sized puddles and rock pools
   along the river, which were not being used as nests, contained these
   elements. This suggests the items had been actively removed from the
   nests. Particularly in type 2 and 3 nests (see below) these sediments,
   leaf-litter and gravel, had been pushed to the edges of the nest, there
   forming a dam like structure, being most obvious in type 3. All nests
   could be completely isolated from the river (at least until water level
   rises) or were connected by shallow in- and outflow. Type 3 nests
   allowed a kind of ‘filtered’ in- and outflow of water due to the stone
   and gravel barrier.

Nest site use

   In 14 nests we found C. goliath eggs, attached to the ground (solid
   rock, stones, pebbles, branches or leaves; Figure 5(b)), scattered or
   clustered (numbers usually varied between 20–150 eggs per 100 cm^2) but
   always spread across the entire area of the nests. Exact clutch size
   could not be recorded as eggs, especially older ones, merged to a grey
   mass with sand and other material sticking to the egg capsules, making
   it impossible to identify the individual eggs without destroying them.
   Based on what was countable we estimated for most nests that egg
   numbers varied from 150 to 350. However, in two cases we counted 709
   and 678 eggs in one quarter of a nest. In those two nests the eggs were
   more or less homogenously scattered across the nest sites. We therefore
   estimate that each nest comprised about 2700–2800 eggs, respectively.
   Four nests did not show recent traces of breeding activity but had been
   defined as nest sites due to their structure (typical type 2 nests, see
   above). Nest 11 was dried up, nests 6, 12 and 13 showed signs of traps
   that local poachers typically use to catch C. goliath (elastic branches
   tied together to form a tennis racket like frame, to which 15 to 25
   fishhooks are attached on 20 to 30 cm long fishing lines; Figure 4).
   Nests 7, 8 and 17 showed recent frog activity, i.e. the ground cleared;
   however, it seemed that we and/or poachers scared off the frogs, which
   subsequently did not come back. In one case (nest 15) the frogs seemed
   to have terminated the construction work. We thereafter found a new
   nest (nest 16) 2.5 m apart (Figure 5(a)).

   Several nests were repeatedly used (Table 1), indicated by up to three
   distinctly different sized cohorts of tadpoles. Heavy rainfall could
   trigger raising water levels that lead to spill-outs of eggs and
   tadpoles in all three nest types. Dropping water level after a period
   of five days without rainfall resulted in the drying up of one nest
   (nest 9, type 3). Later this nest dried out permanently and a new nest
   was constructed in close vicinity (nest 22, type 3). One nest was
   permanently dry (nest 11, type 2). Small shrimp (Caridina evae 2009)
   and fish were observed in some type 2 nests connected to the river.
   Nest sites were clustered, not evenly distributed, along the river
   bank, i.e. six clusters best explained the distribution of the spatial
   data (>98%, based on k means; see Figure 2).

   In the 14 active nests, defined as tadpoles or eggs being present at
   least once during our study period (Figure 5(b,c)), we recorded a total
   of 27 clutches (all eggs of identical age, found at one site, were
   defined as belonging to the same clutch). In nine cases eggs
   disappeared within one or two days. Three clutches were spilled out due
   to heavy rainfall, one dried out and three clutches were eaten by the
   shrimp. Two clutches decayed for no obvious reason. In 12 consecutive
   visits we made 195 single observations in 19 nests (red and green
   cells; Table 1). In 156 cases (80%) we identified the nest as
   functional, based on water being present in the nest (green cells;
   Table 1). In 82 (52%) of these 156 events the nests were in use, i.e.
   eggs and/or tadpoles present (Table 1).

Egg and tadpole predators and nest guarding and maintenance

   Nests in use comprised all developmental stages, from eggs to froglets.
   If undisturbed, e.g. no spilling-over of the nests, tadpoles finished
   their development in the nests. Conraua goliath froglets were
   frequently observed near the nests. Several shrimp were repeatedly
   observed feeding on eggs (N = 3). In the presence of shrimp, tadpoles
   formed schools (N = 6), usually moving as far as possible from the
   shrimp. When visiting nests during the night, adult C. goliath were
   always (N = 16) recorded in close vicinity (~3 m) of active nesting
   sites. As any sound, movement, or the light of our torches triggered
   the frogs to escape, typically by jumping into the river (up to 5 m
   jumps), direct observations of the frogs were difficult. However, we
   once observed a frog sitting in a nest, partly cleared from organic
   sediments. Over five days, we were able to follow the construction of a
   nest, from the first apparent digging attempts to egg deposition. The
   frogs jumping away at our appearances indicated that they are usually
   present close to active nests. In order to check for such behavior, we
   installed a camera on nest 16. The images (Figure 5(a)) revealed that a
   large frog of unknown sex, sat or moved around the nest shortly after
   nightfall from 6:36 pm to 5:32 am, just minutes before dawn. The frog
   changed its position approximately every 30 to 90 minutes, sitting
   within the nest, on the edges of nests and sometimes up to 3 m from the
   nest. During this entire period, a second larger frog briefly
   approached as well, not triggering any notable reaction of the first
   frog (see video in Supplementary Material).

   In most cases we have no evidence that active nests have been cleaned
   by adults, although they seemed to contain much less leaf-litter or
   detritus than non-active nests and similar structures along the river.
   However, some leaf-litter accumulated again while tadpoles developed.
   This was also the case in nests where new clutches were deposited in
   short sequence and tadpoles and eggs were present at the same time (see
   ‘E, T’ in Table 1). In contrast, after longer periods without
   deposition of new clutches, we could observe repeated cleaning activity
   in existing nests (see oc in Table 1). In those cases where nests still
   contained tadpoles, tadpole numbers were reduced after cleaning,
   indicating that tadpoles were washed into the river due to the digging
   activity.

Observations by frog hunters and farmers

   The digging behavior of Goliath Frogs was never directly observed by
   us. Our interpretation is based on indirect clues (the moved material
   and the structure of the nests) and respective reports by frog hunters
   (N = 4) and local farmers (N = 2). However, it was not certain how many
   of the interviewees have directly witnessed the behavior or have
   repeated secondary information to us. The most detailed description we
   got (from one frog hunter) was that the male would construct the nest
   while the female waits in proximity. Once the nest is finished, the
   male whistles to attract the female, which then is grasped by the male
   and eggs are deposited. Afterwards the female would guard the nest and
   subsequently open the nest towards the river.

Discussion

   Our results confirmed the reports of local frog hunters that Goliath
   Frogs provide some parental care by (i) using nests for oviposition
   which are at least somehow cleaned (type 1 nests), or even constructed
   (type 2 & 3), and (ii) presumably guarding eggs and tadpoles. While
   nest construction has been known from several South American
   leptodactylids (Heyer 1978 Heyer WR. 1978. Systematics of the fuscus
   group of the frog genus Leptodactylus (Amphibia, Leptodactylidae). Sci

   Bornean dicroglossid (Inger 1966 Inger RF. 1966. The systematics and
   zoogeography of the Amphibia of Borneo. Fieldiana Zool.
   52:1–402. [Google Scholar]), such behavior so far was unknown from
   African species. Although we are lacking direct observations of the
   nest construction, several facts indicate that the nests indeed were
   established and used by C. goliath. All three nest types showed a
   common feature: a ground cleaned from leaf-litter and debris,
   excavation piling up on the edges of the nests. This feature is
   particularly striking in comparison with the condition of surrounding
   puddles, which always have thick layers of leaves, debris and
   heterogeneous sand or gravel ground. That a ‘clean’ ground was due to
   the frogs’ activity was underlined in a nest where a Goliath Frog
   apparently just had started with the cleaning process and continued the
   following days. The most convincing argument, that the frogs
   deliberately cleaned and/or constructed these sites, was due to the
   fact that eggs were deposited after a site had been established and
   cleaned, and that new nests were established in close vicinity to nests
   which became dysfunctional, i.e. which dried up or get submerged by
   raising water levels.

   Attaching eggs to substrate is a well-known behavior in anurans to
   prevent the displacement of single eggs and clutches and thus is
   particularly often observed in stream breeders (Duellman and Trueb 1986
   Duellman WE, Trueb L. 1986. Biology of amphibians. New York (NY):
   McGraw‐Hill Co.; p. 670. [Google Scholar]). Conraua goliath attaches
   its eggs, under water, singly or in small groups to rocks, gravel or
   larger pieces of wood (Sabater-Pi 1985 Sabater-Pi J. 1985. Contribution
   to the biology of the Giant Frog (Conraua goliath, Boulenger).
   Amphibia-Reptilia. 6:143–153.
   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar], this paper).
   The cleaning of the ground from leaf-litter and other debris may be in
   order to help preventing eggs from being attached to lose structure and
   thus potentially washed away. The preparation of such a nest site might
   also be meant to attract females to that site. However, apart from the
   observation of one frog hunter, telling us that females are close by
   when males are constructing nests, we have no observation supporting
   this assumption. Finally, a cleaned substrate may facilitate the
   monitoring of potential egg and larval predators. It is known that some
   frogs are able to detect the presence of predators and avoid those
   sites for spawning (Resetarits and Wilbur 1989 Resetarits WJ, Wilbur
   HM. 1989. Choice of oviposition site by Hyla chrysoscelis: role of
   predators and competitors. Ecology. 70:220–228.

   doi:10.1007/s004420050073.[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science
   ®] , [Google Scholar]). However, whether C. goliath is able to judge
   breeding sites for the presence of predators or not, is unknown. The
   use of existing (type 1 & 2) or constructing (type 2 & 3) nests which
   are, at least partly, isolated from the river bed may help to reduce
   predators’ presences (i.e. fish and shrimp), and prevent the eggs from
   being washed away. However, fluctuating water levels may bring in
   predators and/or spill out eggs and tadpoles, or result in total
   mortality when eggs and tadpoles, trapped within the nest, dry up.
   Roughly half of the recorded egg losses were caused by nests drying up
   or being over-flooded.

   Breeding activity of anurans is usually strongly influenced by
   environmental triggers, such as rainfall, influencing the availability
   and suitability of breeding sites (Wells 2007 Wells KD. 2007. The
   ecology and behavior of Amphibians. Chicago: Chicago University Press;
   p. 1148.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). By digging nests into the
   riverbed, Goliath Frogs are less dependent on existing structures
   suitable for egg deposition (presence of non-torrent water, absence of
   predators), both during the dry season when natural pools might be dry,
   and the wet season when the river bed is rising. Constructing (nest
   types 2 & 3) or modifying (types 1 & 2) suitable nest sites may thus
   allow the frogs to prolong the possible breeding season and increase
   the number of breeding sites that match their demands, e.g. concerning
   water presence and predator absence.

   The different nest types may have different advantages and
   disadvantages. Nest type 1 was the ‘easiest’ to use, as only the
   cleaning of the substrate was required. However, these nests turned out
   to be the least reliable, as spilling over of the nests, usually
   positioned in the river bed or on the bank of the river, occurred
   frequently. Besides eggs, the young tadpoles may be vulnerable to (i)
   washing out of the nests by overflows and (ii) having predators enter
   the nests. Freshly hatched tadpoles lack several morphological
   adaptations for torrential lifestyles, including a streamlined body,
   muscular tail, and mouth sucker, which typically develop in Gosner
   stage 26 or 27 (Gosner 1960 Gosner KL. 1960. A simplified table staging
   anuran embryo and larvae with notes on identification. Herpetologica.
   16:183–190. [Google Scholar]; Sabater-Pi 1985 Sabater-Pi J. 1985.
   Contribution to the biology of the Giant Frog (Conraua goliath,
   Boulenger). Amphibia-Reptilia. 6:143–153.
   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). Rock pools
   with smooth ground will certainly be the nest type that offers the
   least protection from being washed out, whereas coarse gravel nests,
   offering interstitial gaps, might enhance the chances for eggs and
   tadpoles to not be displaced. However, if the water level does not show
   major fluctuations, a rock pool might be a suitable nesting site,
   offering the advantage of requiring only minimal effort by the adults.
   In contrast type 2, and in particular type 3 nests were less likely to
   be over-flooded, but instead have a higher risk of drying up during
   periods of dropping water levels. In addition, they need much effort
   from the frogs to be established. We believe that the use of different
   nest types thus might reflect trade-offs between availability of sites,
   construction costs and survival probabilities of the offspring.

   The clustered distribution of the nests indicates that Goliath Frogs
   may have territories. This has already been suggested by Sabater-Pi
   (1985 Sabater-Pi J. 1985. Contribution to the biology of the Giant Frog
   (Conraua goliath, Boulenger). Amphibia-Reptilia. 6:143–153.
   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). However,
   this needs further investigation, as we were not able to track the
   locations of individual frogs in our study. Additionally, it is unclear
   which sex is (i) responsible for the construction or cleaning of nest
   sites, and (ii) responsible for defending or guarding the nest sites.
   The relatively small clutch and egg size in most nests, compared to the
   frogs’ body size, might indicate that females do not deposit all their
   eggs at once, but that several smaller clutches are placed in the same
   or different nest over a certain period (Wells 2007 Wells KD. 2007. The
   ecology and behavior of Amphibians. Chicago: Chicago University Press;
   p. 1148.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar], and references therein). This
   could also explain the presence of different cohorts of tadpoles in the
   same nest.

   Our new findings of the reproductive biology of C. goliath, i.e. the
   active establishing of nests, suggest as well an explanation for the
   question, why Goliath Frogs have become the biggest anuran species in
   the world. Digging out a nest that exceeds 1 m in diameter and 10 cm in
   depth, by moving coarse gravel and stones of several kilograms, is a
   serious physical task, and suggest a potential explanation for why
   Goliath frogs are among the largest frogs in the world. Other frog
   species that are known to conduct arduous labor when preparing spawning
   sites are as well at the upper limits of anuran body size range.
   Examples are male African Bullfrogs (Pyxicephalus adspersus) which
   guard tadpoles and are digging channels to allow tadpoles to escape
   drying pools (Balinsky and Balinsky 1954 Balinsky BI, Balinsky JB.

   that construct nests. Another large African frog, Aubria subsigillata,
   also seems to guard tadpoles (Jongsma and Emrich 2012 Jongsma GFM,
   Emrich A. 2012. Aubria subsigillata (brown ball frog). Parental care.
   Herpetol Rev. 43:630–631. [Google Scholar]), but it is not clear which
   sex is performing this activity. Interestingly a close relative of the
   Goliath Frog, the much smaller Conraua crassipes (Buchholz and Peters,
   1875) (maximum SVL 81 mm), has become known to build sandy heaps on
   which they sit, just above the water surface (Amiet 1990 Amiet J-L.

   phonation bouche ouverte chez Conraua crassipes (Buchholz & Peters,
   1875). Alytes. 8:99–104. [Google Scholar]). Thus the capability to
   modify the environment to some extent might be a feature of this family
   of frogs.

   Table 1. Consecutive observations of 22 Conraua goliath nesting sites
   over 12 survey days: no = nest number, t = nest type (see text for
   definitions), Ø = maximum diameter [cm], d = maximum depth [cm], green
   cells: nests being usable (water depth > 4 cm); red: nests not usable
   (water depth < 4 cm); blue: nesting site incomplete; white: no
   observation. Capital letters refer to present fauna: - = nest empty, E
   = eggs, T = tadpoles, S = shrimp; du = dried up, sm = submerged (former
   boundaries under water not clearly defining the nest any longer),
   so = spilled out (no eggs or tadpoles detectable, sometimes remaining
   egg capsules), oc = ongoing construction; red capital letters refer to
   events were eggs were eaten or rotting; green capital letters refer to
   new clutch.

   Example how to read the table: on March 3 a new clutch was found in
   nest 10 (type 1 nest, rock pool); the following observation (March 8)
   revealed no eggs, tadpoles or egg capsules. Water level after excessive
   rainfalls in the days between 3 and 8 March presumably had been spilled
   out the eggs.

   ABSTRACT

   Erotic topics are common in dreams. This study’s objective was to find
   and explain factors influencing the frequency of these erotic dreams
   using an online survey in a German sample with a broad age range. 2907
   participants estimated what percentage of their recalled dreams
   contained erotic motifs and provided both demographic and dream related
   information. On average, participants estimated that 18 percent of
   their dreams are erotic-related. This mean value was higher than the
   figures of previous diary studies. While men’s dreams contain erotic
   themes more often than women’s and a younger age increased erotic dream
   frequency, the education of the participants had no influence on the
   percentage of erotic dreams. Referring to the continuity hypothesis,
   gender differences can be explained with the amount of time spent with
   sexual thoughts and fantasies in waking life and increased with the
   participant’s age, suggesting a cohort effect. Future research should
   investigate the relationship between erotic dreaming and variables like
   personality, psychopathology, and physiological measures like
   testosterone.
   KEYWORDS: Erotic dreams, continuity hypothesis, gender differences, age
   effects

   ABSTRACT

   Intimate partner violence (IPV) by men against their partners is one of
   the most glaring indicators of women's lack of empowerment. Drawing
   upon the 2010 Ecuador Household Asset Survey (EAFF) and the 2010 Ghana
   Household Asset Survey (GHAS), nationally representative surveys for
   Ecuador and Ghana, respectively, this study investigates the
   relationship between women's ownership of assets and physical and
   emotional abuse by spouses against currently partnered women over the
   previous twelve months. It uses the value of a woman's total assets
   compared to those of her partner as the main proxy for a woman's
   bargaining power. Differentiating between physical and emotional
   violence in both countries, the study finds that women's share of
   couple wealth is significantly associated with lower odds of physical
   violence in Ecuador and emotional violence in Ghana. Moreover, the
   association between women's share of couple wealth and IPV is
   contingent on the household's position in the wealth distribution.

ABSTRACT

   ABSTRACT

   In contrast to its popularity, astonishingly few facts have become
   known about the biology of the Goliath Frog, Conraua goliath. We herein
   report the so far unknown construction of nests as spawning sites by
   this species. On the Mpoula River, Littoral District, West Cameroon we
   identified 19 nests along a 400 m section. Nests could be classified
   into three types. Type 1 constitutes rock pools that were cleared by
   the frogs from detritus and leaf-litter; type 2 constitutes existing
   washouts at the riverbanks that were cleared from leaf-litter and/or
   expanded, and type 3 were depressions dug by the frogs into gravel
   riverbanks. The cleaning and digging activities of the frogs included
   removal of small to larger items, ranging from sand and leaves to
   larger stones. In all nest types eggs and tadpoles of C. goliath were
   detected. All nest types were used for egg deposition several times,
   and could comprise up to three distinct cohorts of tadpoles. Nests
   seemed to be clustered. Camera trapping revealed that nests are guarded
   by adult frogs at night. The breeding nests may allow the frogs to
   deposit their eggs away from the torrent rivers, and potential egg and
   tadpole predators. As nest construction, at least in some cases,
   requires the removal of large and heavy items, we hypothesize that this
   can only be achieved by decent sized frogs, possibly explaining the
   unique size of the species.

Introduction

   Amphibians have evolved the most diverse reproductive strategies of all
   terrestrial vertebrates (Duellman and Trueb 1986 Duellman WE, Trueb L.

   670. [Google Scholar]; Haddad et al. 2005 Haddad CFB, Prado CPA. 2005.

   and behavior of Amphibians. Chicago: Chicago University Press; p.
   1148.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), and new reproductive modes are
   still discovered (e.g. Iskandar et al. 2014 Iskandar DT, Evans BJ,
   McGuire JA. 2014. A novel reproductive mode in frogs: a new species of
   fanged frog with internal fertilization and birth of tadpoles. PLoS

   doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0116154.[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science
   ®] , [Google Scholar]). One of the most famous frogs is the largest
   living species, the Goliath Frog, Conraua goliath (Boulenger, 1906
   Boulenger GA. 1906. Descriptions of new batrachians discovered by Mr.
   G.L. Bates in South Cameroon. Ann Mag Nat History. 17:317–323.

   Scholar]), reaching more than 34 cm snout-vent-length and occurring
   along streams in lowland and mid-altitude rainforest from southwestern
   Cameroon into Equatorial Guinea (IUCN 2019 IUCN SSC Amphibian
   Specialist Group. 2019. Conraua goliath. The IUCN red list of
   threatened species 2019: e.T5263A96062132. Downloaded on 02 April
   2019. [Google Scholar]; Figure 1). In contrast to its degree of
   popularity, astonishingly few facts have become known about its
   biology. Previous studies address the taxonomy of the species (Lamotte
   and Perret 1968 Lamotte M, Perret J-L. 1968. Révision du genre Conraua
   Nieden. Bull l’Institut françaises d’Afrique noire.
   30:1603–1644. [Google Scholar]), the tadpoles (Lamotte et al. 1959

   keep it in captivity (Gewalt 1977 Gewalt W. 1977. Einige Bemerkungen

   1996. Vom Goliathfrosch in Südkamerun. TI Mag. 28(129):44–47. [Google
   Scholar]), and its consumption as bush meat (Gonwouo and Rödel 2008

   of the Bakossi people around mount Manengouba, Cameroon, with special
   consideration of the hairy frog, Trichobatrachus robustus. Salamandra.
   44:23–34. [Google Scholar]), but very little is known about its
   reproductive biology and behavior. One study, Sabater-Pi (1985
   Sabater-Pi J. 1985. Contribution to the biology of the Giant Frog
   (Conraua goliath, Boulenger). Amphibia-Reptilia. 6:143–153.
   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), reported
   details concerning the larval development and some aspects of the
   species’ reproduction; however, without mentioning any kind of parental
   care. During recent field work, we have been repeatedly informed by
   local Goliath Frog hunters, that this species constructs nests for egg
   deposition and guards the tadpoles. We thus decided to improve
   knowledge surrounding the reproductive biology of C. goliath and
   investigate whether these frogs exhibit nest construction and parental
   care.

Material and methods

   From February to May 2018 we repeatedly searched a 400 m long section
   (4°38ʹ15ʺN, 9°43ʹ07ʺE to 4°38ʹ25ʺN 9°43ʹ9ʺE) along the Mpoula River
   near the city of Penja, Littoral District, western Cameroon (app. 200 m
   a.s.l.), for Goliath Frog nesting sites (Figure 2). Mpoula River
   comprises very different habitats. Very turbulent rocky sections of the
   river, not wider than 5 m with cascades and small waterfalls of 20 to
   120 cm height, could be followed by calm sandy areas of more than 50 m
   width and less than 10 cm water depth; or deep (> 1.5 m) stagnant,
   muddy sections. Most of the original gallery forest has been converted
   into small plantations and gardens, and a banana plantation nearly
   reaches the riverbed. Only on very steep sections of the river bank,
   gallery forest still persists. During our survey we witnessed ongoing
   slash and burn clearing of remaining forest parts, as well as pesticide
   spraying by airplane (plantation) and hand-pumps (villagers).

   river discharges southwards.

   In total we surveyed this section on 12 days, searching for new
   breeding sites and assessing the use in already known sites. During
   four nights we focused on behavioral observations. Searching for
   breeding sites was conducted by two people, wading in parallel along
   both banks. Potential nests were initially identified by the presence
   of C. goliath tadpoles or eggs (Figure 5(b,c)). After we learned what
   to look for, we identified and registered all similarly structured
   sites, regardless of eggs or tadpoles’ presence. In order to
   distinguish nests from non-nests; i.e. when concerning rock pools and
   water-filled depressions in sandbanks, we checked if these places had
   been apparently cleared from leaf-litter and other detritus, and if the
   excavated material piled up at the edges (and looked different to what
   would be expected to be caused by the water current). The structure,
   position, diameter and maximum depth of any potential nest was
   recorded. During each visit of the area each nest was checked for the
   presence of eggs, tadpoles, distinct tadpole size classes, predators,
   water depth and temperature. For spatial analysis of nest clusters, GPS
   coordinates were Z transformed and the k means clusters computed using
   R software version 3.4.3.

   For the nocturnal observations, we focused on the nesting site that
   showed the most recent changes between the last and the respective
   actual day visit. In particular, we decided to surveil one nest (#16;
   Figures 2 and 5(a)) with a 16-megapixel, low-glow infrared camera trap
   (BestoU®, Model 16). After realizing that the motion detector, 3 m from
   the nest, was not sensitive enough to record apparent frog activities,
   we decided to use the time-lapse option of the camera, taking pictures
   every 20 seconds, starting from shortly before nightfall for a duration
   of 11 h. The camera was positioned approximately 1.4 m above water
   level and 3 m from the nest.

   In addition, we interviewed three local frog hunters and one frog
   hunter from the Nkongsamba region, as well as two villagers, having
   their gardens on the shore of the Mpoula River, for their knowledge on
   C. goliath breeding habits.

Results

Nest numbers, sites and characteristics

   From February 27 to May 5, we recorded a total of 22 sites along the
   river (Figure 2), which were used by Goliath Frogs as breeding sites.
   Identification of these sites was due to the above-mentioned criteria.
   Seven sites were found on the first day, and another nine on the second
   visit. Two more sites were detected on the third visit and another
   three on the fourth. Lastly, one site was identified on the eleventh
   visit (Table 1). Nineteen of these sites were round to oval
   water-filled depressions (mean maximal depth 9.1 ± 2.1 cm) not
   exceeding 140 cm in diameter (mean diameter 102.8 ± 14.5 cm). Three
   sites were smaller, measuring <60 cm in diameter (Table 1), showing all
   above mentioned features, but were never (during our survey) completed
   or used as nests.

   The origin and structure of the nest sites allowed them to be grouped
   into three types (Figure 3). Type 1 (Figure 3(a)) comprised rock-pools
   (N = 2), situated on larger rock faces within the river bed. Thus frogs
   were using pre-existing structures for breeding. Eggs or tadpoles
   revealed the identity as nest; however, the lack of leaf-litter and
   other organic sediments, especially in respect of the near surrounding,
   was striking. Type 2 nests (N = 14; Figure 3(b)) were naturally
   existing washouts or shallow pools close to the river bank, which
   seemed to have been enlarged by the frogs and again were cleared from
   sediments such as leaf-litter. Similarly, type 3 nests (N = 6; Figures
   3(c)) and 5(a)) were shallow water filled depressions with gravel or
   sandy ground, encircled by larger stones and rocks. The uniform
   structure of small gravel or sand in the center, lacking any other
   larger stones (only massive rocks remained) but surrounded by large
   stones, some of them quite apparently being moved recently (stones

   fishhooks set above breeding habitats (a, c) or with traps (b).

   One main aspect that all nests had in common was that the substrate
   seems to have been cleaned, because leaf-litter and other detritus were
   absent from these sites. Other similarly sized puddles and rock pools
   along the river, which were not being used as nests, contained these
   elements. This suggests the items had been actively removed from the
   nests. Particularly in type 2 and 3 nests (see below) these sediments,
   leaf-litter and gravel, had been pushed to the edges of the nest, there
   forming a dam like structure, being most obvious in type 3. All nests
   could be completely isolated from the river (at least until water level
   rises) or were connected by shallow in- and outflow. Type 3 nests
   allowed a kind of ‘filtered’ in- and outflow of water due to the stone
   and gravel barrier.

Nest site use

   In 14 nests we found C. goliath eggs, attached to the ground (solid
   rock, stones, pebbles, branches or leaves; Figure 5(b)), scattered or
   clustered (numbers usually varied between 20–150 eggs per 100 cm^2) but
   always spread across the entire area of the nests. Exact clutch size
   could not be recorded as eggs, especially older ones, merged to a grey
   mass with sand and other material sticking to the egg capsules, making
   it impossible to identify the individual eggs without destroying them.
   Based on what was countable we estimated for most nests that egg
   numbers varied from 150 to 350. However, in two cases we counted 709
   and 678 eggs in one quarter of a nest. In those two nests the eggs were
   more or less homogenously scattered across the nest sites. We therefore
   estimate that each nest comprised about 2700–2800 eggs, respectively.
   Four nests did not show recent traces of breeding activity but had been
   defined as nest sites due to their structure (typical type 2 nests, see
   above). Nest 11 was dried up, nests 6, 12 and 13 showed signs of traps
   that local poachers typically use to catch C. goliath (elastic branches
   tied together to form a tennis racket like frame, to which 15 to 25
   fishhooks are attached on 20 to 30 cm long fishing lines; Figure 4).
   Nests 7, 8 and 17 showed recent frog activity, i.e. the ground cleared;
   however, it seemed that we and/or poachers scared off the frogs, which
   subsequently did not come back. In one case (nest 15) the frogs seemed
   to have terminated the construction work. We thereafter found a new
   nest (nest 16) 2.5 m apart (Figure 5(a)).

   of nest 16 (compare text and Supplementary Material); (b) eggs attached
   to cleaned nest ground; (c) tadpole in advanced developmental stage,
   the white dots above its head and at the left margin, are new eggs.

   Several nests were repeatedly used (Table 1), indicated by up to three
   distinctly different sized cohorts of tadpoles. Heavy rainfall could
   trigger raising water levels that lead to spill-outs of eggs and
   tadpoles in all three nest types. Dropping water level after a period
   of five days without rainfall resulted in the drying up of one nest
   (nest 9, type 3). Later this nest dried out permanently and a new nest
   was constructed in close vicinity (nest 22, type 3). One nest was
   permanently dry (nest 11, type 2). Small shrimp (Caridina evae 2009)
   and fish were observed in some type 2 nests connected to the river.
   Nest sites were clustered, not evenly distributed, along the river
   bank, i.e. six clusters best explained the distribution of the spatial
   data (>98%, based on k means; see Figure 2).

   In the 14 active nests, defined as tadpoles or eggs being present at
   least once during our study period (Figure 5(b,c)), we recorded a total
   of 27 clutches (all eggs of identical age, found at one site, were
   defined as belonging to the same clutch). In nine cases eggs
   disappeared within one or two days. Three clutches were spilled out due
   to heavy rainfall, one dried out and three clutches were eaten by the
   shrimp. Two clutches decayed for no obvious reason. In 12 consecutive
   visits we made 195 single observations in 19 nests (red and green
   cells; Table 1). In 156 cases (80%) we identified the nest as
   functional, based on water being present in the nest (green cells;
   Table 1). In 82 (52%) of these 156 events the nests were in use, i.e.
   eggs and/or tadpoles present (Table 1).

Egg and tadpole predators and nest guarding and maintenance

   Nests in use comprised all developmental stages, from eggs to froglets.
   If undisturbed, e.g. no spilling-over of the nests, tadpoles finished
   their development in the nests. Conraua goliath froglets were
   frequently observed near the nests. Several shrimp were repeatedly
   observed feeding on eggs (N = 3). In the presence of shrimp, tadpoles
   formed schools (N = 6), usually moving as far as possible from the
   shrimp. When visiting nests during the night, adult C. goliath were
   always (N = 16) recorded in close vicinity (~3 m) of active nesting
   sites. As any sound, movement, or the light of our torches triggered
   the frogs to escape, typically by jumping into the river (up to 5 m
   jumps), direct observations of the frogs were difficult. However, we
   once observed a frog sitting in a nest, partly cleared from organic
   sediments. Over five days, we were able to follow the construction of a
   nest, from the first apparent digging attempts to egg deposition. The
   frogs jumping away at our appearances indicated that they are usually
   present close to active nests. In order to check for such behavior, we
   installed a camera on nest 16. The images (Figure 5(a)) revealed that a
   large frog of unknown sex, sat or moved around the nest shortly after
   nightfall from 6:36 pm to 5:32 am, just minutes before dawn. The frog
   changed its position approximately every 30 to 90 minutes, sitting
   within the nest, on the edges of nests and sometimes up to 3 m from the
   nest. During this entire period, a second larger frog briefly
   approached as well, not triggering any notable reaction of the first
   frog (see video in Supplementary Material).

   In most cases we have no evidence that active nests have been cleaned
   by adults, although they seemed to contain much less leaf-litter or
   detritus than non-active nests and similar structures along the river.
   However, some leaf-litter accumulated again while tadpoles developed.
   This was also the case in nests where new clutches were deposited in
   short sequence and tadpoles and eggs were present at the same time (see
   ‘E, T’ in Table 1). In contrast, after longer periods without
   deposition of new clutches, we could observe repeated cleaning activity
   in existing nests (see oc in Table 1). In those cases where nests still
   contained tadpoles, tadpole numbers were reduced after cleaning,
   indicating that tadpoles were washed into the river due to the digging
   activity.

Observations by frog hunters and farmers

   The digging behavior of Goliath Frogs was never directly observed by
   us. Our interpretation is based on indirect clues (the moved material
   and the structure of the nests) and respective reports by frog hunters
   (N = 4) and local farmers (N = 2). However, it was not certain how many
   of the interviewees have directly witnessed the behavior or have
   repeated secondary information to us. The most detailed description we
   got (from one frog hunter) was that the male would construct the nest
   while the female waits in proximity. Once the nest is finished, the
   male whistles to attract the female, which then is grasped by the male
   and eggs are deposited. Afterwards the female would guard the nest and
   subsequently open the nest towards the river.

Discussion

   Our results confirmed the reports of local frog hunters that Goliath
   Frogs provide some parental care by (i) using nests for oviposition
   which are at least somehow cleaned (type 1 nests), or even constructed
   (type 2 & 3), and (ii) presumably guarding eggs and tadpoles. While
   nest construction has been known from several South American
   leptodactylids (Heyer 1978 Heyer WR. 1978. Systematics of the fuscus
   group of the frog genus Leptodactylus (Amphibia, Leptodactylidae). Sci

   Bornean dicroglossid (Inger 1966 Inger RF. 1966. The systematics and
   zoogeography of the Amphibia of Borneo. Fieldiana Zool.
   52:1–402. [Google Scholar]), such behavior so far was unknown from
   African species. Although we are lacking direct observations of the
   nest construction, several facts indicate that the nests indeed were
   established and used by C. goliath. All three nest types showed a
   common feature: a ground cleaned from leaf-litter and debris,
   excavation piling up on the edges of the nests. This feature is
   particularly striking in comparison with the condition of surrounding
   puddles, which always have thick layers of leaves, debris and
   heterogeneous sand or gravel ground. That a ‘clean’ ground was due to
   the frogs’ activity was underlined in a nest where a Goliath Frog
   apparently just had started with the cleaning process and continued the
   following days. The most convincing argument, that the frogs
   deliberately cleaned and/or constructed these sites, was due to the
   fact that eggs were deposited after a site had been established and
   cleaned, and that new nests were established in close vicinity to nests
   which became dysfunctional, i.e. which dried up or get submerged by
   raising water levels.

   Attaching eggs to substrate is a well-known behavior in anurans to
   prevent the displacement of single eggs and clutches and thus is
   particularly often observed in stream breeders (Duellman and Trueb 1986
   Duellman WE, Trueb L. 1986. Biology of amphibians. New York (NY):
   McGraw‐Hill Co.; p. 670. [Google Scholar]). Conraua goliath attaches
   its eggs, under water, singly or in small groups to rocks, gravel or
   larger pieces of wood (Sabater-Pi 1985 Sabater-Pi J. 1985. Contribution
   to the biology of the Giant Frog (Conraua goliath, Boulenger).
   Amphibia-Reptilia. 6:143–153.
   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar], this paper).
   The cleaning of the ground from leaf-litter and other debris may be in
   order to help preventing eggs from being attached to lose structure and
   thus potentially washed away. The preparation of such a nest site might
   also be meant to attract females to that site. However, apart from the
   observation of one frog hunter, telling us that females are close by
   when males are constructing nests, we have no observation supporting
   this assumption. Finally, a cleaned substrate may facilitate the
   monitoring of potential egg and larval predators. It is known that some
   frogs are able to detect the presence of predators and avoid those
   sites for spawning (Resetarits and Wilbur 1989 Resetarits WJ, Wilbur
   HM. 1989. Choice of oviposition site by Hyla chrysoscelis: role of
   predators and competitors. Ecology. 70:220–228.

   doi:10.1007/s004420050073.[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science
   ®] , [Google Scholar]). However, whether C. goliath is able to judge
   breeding sites for the presence of predators or not, is unknown. The
   use of existing (type 1 & 2) or constructing (type 2 & 3) nests which
   are, at least partly, isolated from the river bed may help to reduce
   predators’ presences (i.e. fish and shrimp), and prevent the eggs from
   being washed away. However, fluctuating water levels may bring in
   predators and/or spill out eggs and tadpoles, or result in total
   mortality when eggs and tadpoles, trapped within the nest, dry up.
   Roughly half of the recorded egg losses were caused by nests drying up
   or being over-flooded.

   Breeding activity of anurans is usually strongly influenced by
   environmental triggers, such as rainfall, influencing the availability
   and suitability of breeding sites (Wells 2007 Wells KD. 2007. The
   ecology and behavior of Amphibians. Chicago: Chicago University Press;
   p. 1148.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). By digging nests into the
   riverbed, Goliath Frogs are less dependent on existing structures
   suitable for egg deposition (presence of non-torrent water, absence of
   predators), both during the dry season when natural pools might be dry,
   and the wet season when the river bed is rising. Constructing (nest
   types 2 & 3) or modifying (types 1 & 2) suitable nest sites may thus
   allow the frogs to prolong the possible breeding season and increase
   the number of breeding sites that match their demands, e.g. concerning
   water presence and predator absence.

   The different nest types may have different advantages and
   disadvantages. Nest type 1 was the ‘easiest’ to use, as only the
   cleaning of the substrate was required. However, these nests turned out
   to be the least reliable, as spilling over of the nests, usually
   positioned in the river bed or on the bank of the river, occurred
   frequently. Besides eggs, the young tadpoles may be vulnerable to (i)
   washing out of the nests by overflows and (ii) having predators enter
   the nests. Freshly hatched tadpoles lack several morphological
   adaptations for torrential lifestyles, including a streamlined body,
   muscular tail, and mouth sucker, which typically develop in Gosner
   stage 26 or 27 (Gosner 1960 Gosner KL. 1960. A simplified table staging
   anuran embryo and larvae with notes on identification. Herpetologica.
   16:183–190. [Google Scholar]; Sabater-Pi 1985 Sabater-Pi J. 1985.
   Contribution to the biology of the Giant Frog (Conraua goliath,
   Boulenger). Amphibia-Reptilia. 6:143–153.
   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). Rock pools
   with smooth ground will certainly be the nest type that offers the
   least protection from being washed out, whereas coarse gravel nests,
   offering interstitial gaps, might enhance the chances for eggs and
   tadpoles to not be displaced. However, if the water level does not show
   major fluctuations, a rock pool might be a suitable nesting site,
   offering the advantage of requiring only minimal effort by the adults.
   In contrast type 2, and in particular type 3 nests were less likely to
   be over-flooded, but instead have a higher risk of drying up during
   periods of dropping water levels. In addition, they need much effort
   from the frogs to be established. We believe that the use of different
   nest types thus might reflect trade-offs between availability of sites,
   construction costs and survival probabilities of the offspring.

   The clustered distribution of the nests indicates that Goliath Frogs
   may have territories. This has already been suggested by Sabater-Pi
   (1985 Sabater-Pi J. 1985. Contribution to the biology of the Giant Frog
   (Conraua goliath, Boulenger). Amphibia-Reptilia. 6:143–153.
   doi:10.1163/156853885X00047.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). However,
   this needs further investigation, as we were not able to track the
   locations of individual frogs in our study. Additionally, it is unclear
   which sex is (i) responsible for the construction or cleaning of nest
   sites, and (ii) responsible for defending or guarding the nest sites.
   The relatively small clutch and egg size in most nests, compared to the
   frogs’ body size, might indicate that females do not deposit all their
   eggs at once, but that several smaller clutches are placed in the same
   or different nest over a certain period (Wells 2007 Wells KD. 2007. The
   ecology and behavior of Amphibians. Chicago: Chicago University Press;
   p. 1148.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar], and references therein). This
   could also explain the presence of different cohorts of tadpoles in the
   same nest.

   Our new findings of the reproductive biology of C. goliath, i.e. the
   active establishing of nests, suggest as well an explanation for the
   question, why Goliath Frogs have become the biggest anuran species in
   the world. Digging out a nest that exceeds 1 m in diameter and 10 cm in
   depth, by moving coarse gravel and stones of several kilograms, is a
   serious physical task, and suggest a potential explanation for why
   Goliath frogs are among the largest frogs in the world. Other frog
   species that are known to conduct arduous labor when preparing spawning
   sites are as well at the upper limits of anuran body size range.
   Examples are male African Bullfrogs (Pyxicephalus adspersus) which
   guard tadpoles and are digging channels to allow tadpoles to escape
   drying pools (Balinsky and Balinsky 1954 Balinsky BI, Balinsky JB.

   that construct nests. Another large African frog, Aubria subsigillata,
   also seems to guard tadpoles (Jongsma and Emrich 2012 Jongsma GFM,
   Emrich A. 2012. Aubria subsigillata (brown ball frog). Parental care.
   Herpetol Rev. 43:630–631. [Google Scholar]), but it is not clear which
   sex is performing this activity. Interestingly a close relative of the
   Goliath Frog, the much smaller Conraua crassipes (Buchholz and Peters,
   1875) (maximum SVL 81 mm), has become known to build sandy heaps on
   which they sit, just above the water surface (Amiet 1990 Amiet J-L.

   phonation bouche ouverte chez Conraua crassipes (Buchholz & Peters,
   1875). Alytes. 8:99–104. [Google Scholar]). Thus the capability to
   modify the environment to some extent might be a feature of this family
   of frogs.

   ABSTRACT

   Erotic topics are common in dreams. This study’s objective was to find
   and explain factors influencing the frequency of these erotic dreams
   using an online survey in a German sample with a broad age range. 2907
   participants estimated what percentage of their recalled dreams
   contained erotic motifs and provided both demographic and dream related
   information. On average, participants estimated that 18 percent of
   their dreams are erotic-related. This mean value was higher than the
   figures of previous diary studies. While men’s dreams contain erotic
   themes more often than women’s and a younger age increased erotic dream
   frequency, the education of the participants had no influence on the
   percentage of erotic dreams. Referring to the continuity hypothesis,
   gender differences can be explained with the amount of time spent with
   sexual thoughts and fantasies in waking life and increased with the
   participant’s age, suggesting a cohort effect. Future research should
   investigate the relationship between erotic dreaming and variables like
   personality, psychopathology, and physiological measures like
   testosterone.
   KEYWORDS: Erotic dreams, continuity hypothesis, gender differences, age
   effects

   ABSTRACT

   Intimate partner violence (IPV) by men against their partners is one of
   the most glaring indicators of women's lack of empowerment. Drawing
   upon the 2010 Ecuador Household Asset Survey (EAFF) and the 2010 Ghana
   Household Asset Survey (GHAS), nationally representative surveys for
   Ecuador and Ghana, respectively, this study investigates the
   relationship between women's ownership of assets and physical and
   emotional abuse by spouses against currently partnered women over the
   previous twelve months. It uses the value of a woman's total assets
   compared to those of her partner as the main proxy for a woman's
   bargaining power. Differentiating between physical and emotional
   violence in both countries, the study finds that women's share of
   couple wealth is significantly associated with lower odds of physical
   violence in Ecuador and emotional violence in Ghana. Moreover, the
   association between women's share of couple wealth and IPV is
   contingent on the household's position in the wealth distribution.
   KEYWORDS: Spousal violence, intrahousehold bargaining, Africa, Latin

   ABSTRACT

   People in many parts of the world commonly share their beds not only
   with human partners but also with dogs and cats. Self-report and
   actigraphy data have shown that sleeping with an adult human partner
   has both positive and negative impacts on human sleep, but there has
   been little exploration of the impacts that pets have on human sleep
   quality. We collected survey data online from 962 adult women living in
   the United States to investigate relationships between pet ownership
   and human sleep. Fifty-five percent of participants shared their bed
   with at least one dog and 31% with at least one cat. In addition, 57%
   of participants shared their bed with a human partner. Our findings did
   not show a strong relationship between pet ownership status or
   bedsharing conditions and sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh
   Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), although according to this measure, a high
   percentage of study participants did experience sleep quality deficits.
   It is possible that pet ownership contributed to the high global PSQI
   scores we observed, especially since all but 7% of participants resided
   with dogs and/or cats. Other measures included in this study indicate
   that dogs and cats, and where they sleep, may indeed affect sleep
   habits and perceptions of sleep quality. Dog owners had earlier
   bedtimes and wake times than individuals who had cats but no dogs.
   Compared with human bed partners, dogs who slept in the owner’s bed
   were perceived to disturb sleep less and were associated with stronger
   feelings of comfort and security. Conversely, cats who slept in their
   owner’s bed were reported to be equally as disruptive as human
   partners, and were associated with weaker feelings of comfort and
   security than both human and dog bed partners. Follow-up research is
   necessary to determine if pet owners’ perceptions of pets’ impacts on
   their sleep align with objective measures of sleep quality.
   Keywords: cats, companion animals, dogs, human–animal
   interaction, pets, sleep habits, sleep quality

   ABSTRACT

   The present study examined the beliefs of individuals with normative
   identities regarding sex, gender and sexual orientation. Data were
   collected from 691 heterosexual cisgender women and men using an online
   survey. Participants indicated their agreement regarding their beliefs
   about the nature of sex, gender and sexual orientation along four
   dimensions: fixed, binary (i.e. essentialist beliefs), fluid and
   continuous (i.e. social constructionist beliefs). Data analyses for the
   present study centred on four 2 (Participant Gender Identity: Woman vs.
   Man) × 3 (Identity Construct: Sex vs. Gender vs. Sexual Orientation)
   mixed ANOVAs. Findings suggested that sex, gender and sexual
   orientation are understood to be distinct and that essentialist and
   constructionist beliefs follow reverse patterns. Heterosexual cisgender
   adults rated sex as the most fixed and binary, followed by gender, and
   then sexual orientation. Conversely, participants rated sexual
   orientation as the most fluid and continuous followed by gender, and
   sex. Men consistently rated all three constructs as more fixed and
   binary and less fluid and continuous than did women. Discussion focuses
   on the utility of investigating normative beliefs about sex, gender and
   sexual orientation as parallel constructs.
   KEYWORDS: Essentialism, sex, gender, sexual orientation, social
   constructionism

   Abstract

   In the UK, incinerators are still seen as a satisfactory answer to the
   problem of getting rid of the increasing quantities of waste, including
   increasing amounts of synthetics. This report examines the scientific
   evidence from all sources concerning the health implications of waste
   incineration, and its costs, explicit and hidden.

   The report reviews what is known about the range of pollutants released
   by incinerators and their health effects. The major air pollutants are
   fine airborne particulates (2.5 µm diameter and smaller), toxic metals,
   and organic chemicals. The precise content of the emissions varies with
   the material incinerated: emitted chemicals include persistent organic
   pollutants, hormone disrupters, and carcinogens, but not all the
   organic components have been identified. In addition, the ash produced
   includes large quantities of highly toxic fine fly ash (air pollution
   control residues), which pose important long‐term health risks.

   Dangers from chemicals have been overlooked in the past: chemicals such
   as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
   were regarded as safe on introduction, but were banned many years later
   because of widespread ill‐effects. Incineration is a source of emission
   of heavy metals and these have a range of harmful health effects. In
   the last 10 years, the health dangers of another major incinerator
   emission, fine particulates, have become widely recognized. These are
   associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, but also with a
   linear increase in mortality (with no safe level), particularly from
   cardiovascular causes. Fine particulates are inspired deep into the
   lungs and carry other toxins, adsorbed to them, into the blood stream.

   Increased adult lung cancer and all cancers have been found in the
   vicinity of incinerators: the peak seems to occur at least 14 years
   after incinerator start‐up. There have been no direct studies of the
   incidence of cardiac illnesses around incinerators, but as incinerators
   are a major source of fine particulates, and ischaemic heart disease is
   a relatively common cause of death, substantial excess cardiac
   mortality and morbidity would be predicted. The foetus and infant are
   particularly susceptible to damage from toxins and carcinogens, and
   there are indications that some effects may be passed to the next
   generation. Increased birth defects and an increased incidence of
   childhood cancers have been demonstrated around incinerators.

   Health costs should always be considered in determining strategies for
   waste disposal. Other methods are available that are safer and cheaper
   in the long term and far cheaper if the high health costs of
   incineration are taken into consideration. We recommend that these more
   modern methods should be used, and that a more stringent and
   independent monitoring system should be introduced. In our view,
   incinerators, with their high risks and high health costs, are a poor
   choice of technology for waste disposal: more modern and safer
   technologies should be used in the future. Tackling the problems of
   both the amount and the nature of waste generated is also of critical
   importance.

   Abstract

   A critical analysis of the present situation on the global water
   resources assessment is made. Basic data and methodological approaches
   used by the author for the assessment and prediction of water
   resources, water use and water availability on the global scale are
   briefly described. On the basis of data generalization of the world
   hydrological network new data are given on the dynamics of renewable
   water resources of the continents, physiographic and economic regions,
   selected countries as well as on the river water inflow to the world
   ocean. The results of the assessments for the 20^th century and for the
   future before 2010–2025 on the water supply for municipal, industrial
   and agricultural needs as well as an additional evaporation from
   reservoirs are presented. Loads on water resources and water
   availability depending on socio-economic and phisiographic factors are
   analyzed; regions of water scarcity and water resources deficit are
   discovered. Possible ways of water supply improvement and elimination
   of water resources deficit in different regions and countries are
   discussed

   Abstract

   Agriculture is the largest contributor to biodiversity loss with
   expanding impacts due to changing consumption patterns and growing
   populations. Agriculture destroys biodiversity by converting natural
   habitats to intensely managed systems and by releasing pollutants,
   including greenhouses gases. Food value chains further amplify impacts
   including through energy use, transport and waste. Reducing the food
   system’s toll on biodiversity is a critical challenge. The ‘sparing or
   sharing’ debate contrasts two response pathways: intensifying
   agriculture to release other land for protection versus
   biodiversity-friendly farming over larger areas. Most conservation
   policies focus on intensification and set-aside but recent research
   challenges these assumptions. The Global Land Outlook of the UN
   Convention to Combat Desertification highlights how modern farming is
   undermining the sustainability of large land areas. Intensification has
   not solved the biodiversity crisis and has often made it worse.
   Effective responses must involve both producers and consumers, and
   require a mixture of conservation, sustainable management and
   restoration. Agricultural land serves many purposes beyond food
   production and mechanisms are needed to pay farmers for wider
   stewardship of land resources. A multifunctional landscape approach
   balances different needs at a landscape scale while incorporating
   site-level specificity on land use, demand, and condition. At the same
   time, consumers play a critical role in reducing unsustainable food
   waste. Many of the techniques and strategies for biodiversity-friendly
   farming systems exist; the challenge is to bring them to scale.
