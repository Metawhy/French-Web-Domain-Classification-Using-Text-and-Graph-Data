What Parents Have to Say…

   There's always something new for us to discover, as well as old
   favorites. I am so grateful to have activities handed to us... Fun and
   easy ones that can be put together in a moment's notice! You're awesome
   Jamie and I appreciate you sharing your activities and ideas!! -
   Melissa C.
   "I absolutely love that this takes all the prep work out of engaging my
   children. It is so easy to just put up the calendar, and glance at it
   for inspiration when we are in a funk." - The Activity Room Member,
   Rachel
   I have found it impossible to Google ideas from a million different
   sites, get organized, shop for supplies, etc. This is exactly what I
   have been searching for! Thanks for making something so organized and
   easy to use. - Early Years Activity Plans User, Melissa C.
   This takes down the need to scour the internet for ideas. It's like
   looking for a recipe on the internet, so many options that often times
   it is less overwhelming to look in a book on the shelf than stress
   about too many options. - Early Years Activity Plans User, Robyn G
   Thank you so much for these activities. They have proven to me that I
   CAN be that mom that does cool and creative things with her kids! And
   those cool and creative things can actually be quite simple! What a
   revelation. Thank you!! - 7 Day Challenge, Katie M.
   I feel like a new mama having so many fun ideas. I used to dread the
   afternoon, after naps, as it was so boring doing the same thing day
   after day but now I look forward to our "play" time! - Haley S.
   You have changed how I spend time with my kid in so many positive ways!
   I am now one happy dad that no longer wonders what I am going to do
   with this little guy for the next 12 hours :P Your site was this first
   time dad life saver! - Jack C.
   It is hard to think of things to keep the 3 year old entertained and
   engaged while taking care of the baby. Everything we have tried so far
   from your website, the three year old has loved. Your ideas are so
   simple and he can do them for hours. HEAVEN! - Karen I.
