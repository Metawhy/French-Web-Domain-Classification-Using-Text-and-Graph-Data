Moody Bathroom Reveal | One Room Challenge | WEEK 6
       We made it. We are here. We are done! It’s very thrilling to have
       successfully completed the One Room Challenge for the very first
       time. I’ve had so much fun following along with the other guest
       participants on Instagram while working hard on my own bathroom
       makeover.
       [bathroom12-2-01.jpeg?resize=740%2C1131]
       When I began planning the bathroom makeover I looked back at some
       of our design inspiration for the space from when we moved into our
       house two years ago. All of my inspiration required huge guts to
       the room: new shower, new vanities, new floors … you catch my
       drift. The thing was though, I really didn’t want to spend our time
       and resources on such an expensive project anymore. Let me remind
       you of the before.
       [IMG_20181003_151354.jpg?resize=740%2C987]
       I looked around the space and asked myself how could I salvage this
       situation with its blah grey vinyl floors and black cultured marble
       sink and countertop.
       [bathroom16-01.jpeg?resize=740%2C1171]
       The answer was that I could give this space a whole new life with a
       moody black and wood look. I counted on black, white and wood to
       mask the scalloped sink and a fun modern bath rug to spruce up the
       bland grey floor. Of course, the pièce de résistance, a stunning
       natural brass light fixture from Kichler, was going to be the
       blinding sparkle that turned the bathroom from rough to diamond.
       [bathroom8-01.jpeg?resize=740%2C1125]
       I can’t even you guys. It’s a stunner in photos but they don’t even
       begin to do the vanity light justice. It’s so gorje in real life
       and the finish is spectacular. The halogen lightbulbs it came with
       are excellent for a bathroom — not too soft, not to daylight and
       perfectly bright. Kichler knows their stuff.
       [bathroom7-1-01.jpeg?resize=740%2C1035]
       This makeover is exactly what our family needed for our main
       bathroom. We were incredibly short on storage and now we are
       overflowing with storage and organization. Thank you One Room
       Challenge for spurring me on to get this project done!

One Room Challenge | Hideaway Garbage Can | Week 5
       One of my big must-haves for my One Room Challenge bathroom
       makeover was installing a window seat in a wide open space at the
       far end of the room. To make that happen I needed to relocate the
       bathroom garbage from a bin on the floor to inside the cabinetry.
       [IMG_20181019_135821.jpg?resize=740%2C987]
       I shopped around a settled on a pullout garbage from Knape & Vogt,
       which are carried by Home Depot. I liked this garbage bin because
       the rack and track were all metal construction.
       The installation was so easy. You just screw down the track in four
       places and snap the rack to the track. The bin easily lifts out for
       emptying and it slides very nicely on the track. I’m trés happy!

       Easy peasy lemon squeezey! Thank you Vogt & Knape for making me
       bathroom dreams come true.

One Room Challenge | DIY Towel Bar and Toilet Paper Holder | Week 4
       It’s a wrap on week four of the One Room Challenge and this week
       I’m sharing a DIY project for you guys. This DIY towel bar, hook
       and toilet paper holder project was an idea inspired by some
       tutorials for making your own budget-friendly lucite towel bars.
       I’ve given the concept a wood twist to customize the look of my
       bathroom makeover with some help from the folks over at Urbanest
       Living.
       [IMG_20181019_195138_193.jpg?resize=740%2C925]
       I really wanted a very specific wood and black look for my towel
       bar, towel hooks and toilet paper roll holder. I also wanted the
       wood to be stained to match the other wood elements in the bathroom
       makeover. To make this project happen I needed something very
       specific: matte black ceiling mounted curtain rod holders, which I
       sourced from Urbanest Living. This was such an easy DIY with huge
       impact for my One Room Challenge bathroom.
       [IMG_20181019_113941.jpg?resize=740%2C555]

DIY Towel Rod and Toilet Paper Holder

MATERIALS
          + ceiling mounted curtain rod brackets in size 1 1/8″
          + 1 1/8″ wood dowel
          + chop saw
          + measuring tape
          + stain (I used Verathane gel stain in Provincial)
          + wax or clearcoat
          + fine grit sandpaper (220+)
          + Philips screwdriver and drill
          + level

INSTRUCTIONS
       STEP 1. Decide on the length of your towel bars, hooks and toilet
       paper roll holder. Each of my pieces has a two inch overhang on the
       ends.
       Towel bar: 23″
       Towel hooks: 4″
       Toilet paper roll holder: 9″
       STEP 2. Measure, mark and cut the dowel into the correct lengths.
       The dowel will already be fairly smooth, but use a fine grit
       sandpaper to clean up the cut edges and remove any markings on the
       dowel pieces.
       STEP 3. Stain the dowel and let dry. Follow the instructions on the
       can of stain. Make sure to seal the wood with a wax or poly clear
       coat. You don’t want any stain residue marking up your towels!
       [IMG_20181019_114043.jpg?resize=740%2C987]
       STEP 4. Take a look at your brackets. Each bracket will have a
       small screw set in it. This is how you will tighten your dowels in
       place and secure them. Because the dowel is made of soft wood you
       will be able to hand turn the screw into the wood with a Philips
       head screw driver.
       Place the brackets on the dowels and figure out how much overhang
       you would like. As I said, I used a 2″ overhang.
       [IMG_20181019_114937.jpg?resize=740%2C987]
       [IMG_20181019_114759-1.jpg?resize=740%2C987]
       STEP 5. Mount to wall using supplied anchors and screws. You will
       need a long drill bit to screw the brackets to the wall. If it’s
       easier you can secure the dowels after your brackets have been
       mounted to the walls instead of before. Make sure you use a level!
       [IMG_20181019_132023.jpg?resize=740%2C987]

One Room Challenge | Open Shelving Love | WEEK 3
       Welcome to week number three of the One Room Challenge. I can’t
       believe that I am wrapping up the third week of the challenge
       already. It’s been so much fun transforming our main bathroom and
       painting as already had a huge impact.
       [IMG_20181017_201451_653-1.jpg?resize=740%2C740&#038;ssl=1]
       The big project on my to-do list this week was to paint, create and
       install these diy open shelves for the bathroom. This bathroom has
       some serious shortage of storage space, as there is no closet! Oh
       the woes.
       I covered the boring grey walls with Simply White by Benjamin Moore
       and then used PPG Paints Manor Hall Interior in Black Magic from
       House Rules Design Shop for the backdrop of the shelving. What a
       fun name right?! How could it not be the right paint for this
       bathroom makeover and it went on so beautifully.
       House Rules Design Shop is headed by Heather Smillie of HGTV fame
       and I knew that she would be able to provide a high quality paint
       at a smart price that would knock this project out of the park. I
       am also using PPG paint for the vanity, in the same colour. If you
       live in the Bruce – Grey area then it is worth a trip to Hanover to
       visit this store!
       The shelves are 2×12 pine from Home Depot stained with Verethane
       Gel Stain in provincial, and are held in place with simple black
       wall brackets, also from Home Depot. I thrifted all of the storage
       baskets and vessels that are on these shelves, mostly from The
       Salvation Army and also Value Village. To refresh, check out the
       WEEK 1 post to see what the space looked like before.
       Stay tuned over the next three weeks to see the full
       transformation. And, head over to Instagram to keep up with all the
       One Room Challenge crazy and check out my story highlights for a
       time lapse video of how I styled the shelves.

One Room Challenge | Honeymoon Over | WEEK 2
       I think this is what they mean when they say the honeymoon phase
       has ended. Last week was all joy and excitement for the One Room
       Challenge. I was buzzing on inspiration and the thrill of working
       with some sweet companies (see the paint colour I picked for the
       vanity!!!)
       [Screenshot_20181011-1551142.png?resize=740%2C959]
       This week I am like, w.t.f. it’s almost Friday and I haven’t
       finished sanding the vanity – my goal this week is prep and I’m not
       done prepping. I was swamped with therapy appointments, some of
       them intense. I’m tired and I wallowed yesterday in misery. A voice
       in my brain kept tellinge me this wasn’t a smart idea, that I can’t
       do it, that it’s too much, that the products I need won’t arrive in
       time.
       That voice is an evil voice. It’s the voice that keeps you from
       being your best self. Today I visited one of my AWESOME sponsors:
       House Rules Design Shop, headed up by the wonderful Heather Smillie
       of HGTV fame. I was refreshed by her design brilliance and being in
       her thriving, inspiring store. I also saw my psychotherapist and
       she spoke reassurance of who I am and what I am capable of.
       The bathroom faucet is on the way. The paint is sitting on my
       basement staircase and the cabinet is almost ready. I can do this.
       If you are ORCing too, then I want to say the same to you. If a
       voice of doubt is gnawing at you then put it in its place because
       you are able, you are awesome.
       [IMG_20181011_160202.jpg?resize=740%2C987]
       [IMG_20181011_160413.jpg?resize=740%2C987]
       I can’t wait to share my experience working with the PPG Paints I
       am using on this vanity and the walls in next week’s post.
