Good Nutrition When You are Trying to Get Fit

       Getting in shape requires more than just regular exercise. Working
       out puts extra demand on your body and while these are good demands
       to make you will need to fuel your workouts with the right food.
       That means eating whole, fresh foods at least 80% of the time and
       only allowing yourself to have something less-than-healthy about
       20% of the time or less. This will allow you some wiggle room and
       make staying on track easier.

What Should You Be Eating?
       The types of food you are putting in your body is extremely
       important when you are trying to reach a higher level of fitness.
       Whole foods that are as close to their natural state as possible
       are the best. When you need to eat pre-made or packaged food you
       should stick to foods with only 3-6 ingredients and you should
       recognize everything on the ingredient list.
       If you have a favorite food that does not meet this criteria you
       should learn to make it for yourself. Even if it is an “unhealthy”
       food it will be better for you if it is homemade and you know what
       is going into it. Do this as often as you can and try to only eat
       at restaurants once or twice a month at the most.
       Once you have committed to cooking meals and eating at home you
       will need to follow some simple guidelines. You should avoid white
       flour and other white starches. Whole grains, brown rice, ancestral
       grains (like quinoa) and sweet potatoes should be the starches that
       you stick too. Peas and corn make good complex carbohydrate choices
       as well.
       Most of your diet should come from fruits and vegetables. Organics
       if you have access and can afford them. If you cannot afford
       organics then wash your vegetables and fruits well and remember
       that just eating vegetables and fruits is a step in the right
       direction.
       Lean meat such as turkey and fish should be treated like a garnish
       on your plate. Get plenty of protein, but do not over do it. Four
       ounces of lean protein is plenty. A 16oz steak is enough food for 4
       people.
       Also remember your healthy fats such as avocado, coconut and olive
       oil, and even a little organic butter. A little fat helps your body
       absorb the nutrients in your vegetables, so do not shy away from
       these. Just remember to use them sparingly. Follow these rules and
       you will have a balanced diet perfect for getting fit and staying
       healthy.
