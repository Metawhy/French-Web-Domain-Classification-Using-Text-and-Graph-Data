Can These Seabirds Adapt Fast Enough to Survive a Melting Arctic?

   On a remote Alaskan sandbar, under the watchful eye of a devoted
   scientist for more than four decades, climate change is forcing a
   colony of seabirds into a real-time race: evolve or go extinct.

   Winter 2017

   On Cooper Island, there aren’t many rules. But one rule that is
   wordlessly respected is you never look directly at South Beach, because
   South Beach is the designated bathroom, sited on a gravel sandbar so
   flat you can take a headcount of all inhabitants from a mile away, no
   lenses required.

   Another rule is you shouldn’t go out alone, but if you do, you should
   take a walkie-talkie and a shotgun, because you never know when a polar
   bear might show up, and if one does, you don’t want the polar bear
   between you and the cabin, the only structure on the island that might
   sustain a clawed assault.

   Not that I know how to fire a shotgun, much less how to disable a
   starving bear keen on making me its meal. But rules are rules, so I
   carry one anyway.

   When camping on an island a short boat ride from the northernmost point
   of Alaska, it’s difficult not to fixate on the bears, one of the few
   remaining animals that make humans prey. When bears do visit, though,
   they’re still not the most charismatic megafauna on Cooper Island. That
   distinction goes to George Divoky, a septuagenarian who’s spent nearly
   11 cumulative years here. By the time I reach Cooper Island on August
   7, Divoky has been here for two months. Between his mop of gray hair
   and unkempt beard—there are no mirrors in the South Beach
   bathroom—shine bright darting eyes that don’t miss much. He wears what
   you might expect of an Arctic field ornithologist: rain pants and a
   parka flecked with splatters of bird poop and undergirded with
   wool-sweater strata.

For 43 years, Divoky has spent every summer here, usually in a tent, and
usually by himself. But the colony of Black Guillemots holds an even greater
claim to the place.


   But few remember Divoky for his appearance; it’s the words that pour
   from his mouth like water from a burst dam that define him. Any object
   in his periphery can inspire a story, told in fractal spurts and with
   oppressive detail, and if he’s interrupted—by a question, a task,
   another thought—he’ll return to his story minutes later, as if the
   world paused in wait of his next word.

   His lingual floodwaters can be disorienting and, to some, off-putting.
   A lifelong outsider in self-imposed exile, Divoky commands a
   conversation and is prone to unwittingly drowning out its more subdued
   participants with his contrarian convictions. But it’s hard to blame
   him, for you, the conversant, are the odd one here on Cooper Island, a
   mere visitor in his world. For the past 43 years, he’s spent every
   summer here, usually in a tent, and usually by himself.

   Even so, the island’s other seasonal inhabitants—the colony of Black
   Guillemots that nest here every summer—hold a greater claim to Cooper
   than Divoky. They are the reason he’s here, and their progenitors were
   here first. It was July 6, 1972, when a Coast Guard icebreaker dropped
   him off for a seabird survey, that he discovered 10 pairs of the
   handsome seabirds nesting under scattered debris—ammo boxes,
   floorboards, and innumerable wood planks—abandoned by the U.S. Navy
   after the Korean War. His find was a northern range expansion for the
   species in Alaska.

   human inhabitants gather to cook, eat, warm up, and socialize. Photo:

   Like a kid flipping rocks to find salamanders, a 26-year-old Divoky
   flipped boards and boxes to search for eggs and create new nesting
   crevices. By the end of the summer, his nest count for the island was
   up to 18. When he returned to Washington, D.C., for a fellowship at the
   Smithsonian, he couldn’t stop thinking about Cooper Island. He was
   struck by the scientific potential of its accessible nest sites and
   seduced by the opportunity to indulge himself in solitary nature. He
   soon relocated to Fairbanks, Alaska, and by 1975 got his hands on
   enough funding to return to Cooper Island for an entire summer. He
   hasn’t missed one since, serially sacrificing employers and girlfriends
   who demanded he choose between them and the guillemots.

   “You have to be careful what you fall in love with in your twenties,”
   he says, unprompted, one evening. “I fell in love with this island.”

   Divoky returned each summer to watch the colony mature, collecting
   meticulous data—growth, breeding, feeding, kinship—on every nesting
   pair and chick, and banding every adult and fledgling. The colony
   thrived, and grew to 200 breeding pairs by 1989. Since then, it’s taken
   a turn for the worse, slowly at first and then into free-fall, and
   Divoky now cares for an island and its birds in decline. “I used to see
   chicks hatch, and I’d see them grow, and they had an 85 to 90 percent
   chance of flying away,” he says. This year 85 pairs bred on the island,
   fledging just 45 chicks out of 120 hatched—not enough to maintain the
   colony’s population.

   predators decimated the colony, birds began nesting in plastic cases.

   Nearly all the causes for this decline—changes in food, competitors,
   and predators—track the warmer air, warmer ocean water, and retreat of
   sea ice near Cooper Island, all symptoms of global climate change
   caused by carbon dioxide. These molecules build up in the atmosphere
   and trap heat, like the layers of blankets required to sleep through
   the night on a sandbar on the Beaufort Sea. Somewhat ironically, if it
   weren’t for climate change, guillemots may never have nested on Cooper
   in the first place: Until the late 1960s, snow blanketed the ground for
   too much of the summer.

   “During my research lifetime, Cooper Island will no longer be able to
   support this species,” Divoky says. “It went from too cold to too warm.
   It should have taken centuries, not decades.”

   And yet he keeps coming back to watch his beloved island decline,
   collecting as much data as he can along the way. Through his ruthless
   devotion, Divoky has created one of the few ecological studies with
   enough long-term, rigorously collected data to illuminate how climate
   change will force populations through an evolutionary bottleneck unlike
   any seen since the last ice age. And the only reason we have even this
   glimpse is because of Divoky, a rare bird indeed.

How a Breeding Colony Loses Ground

   Data Visualization by Katie Peek

   Every summer, Mandt’s Black Guillemots gather at Cooper Island to
   breed. A single pair—they mate for life—may produce about two dozen
   chicks during their 20-year lifetimes. But since 1990, the guillemots’
   numbers have been dropping; fewer of those chicks are surviving to
   adulthood. Because George Divoky has collected 43 years of data at
   Cooper Island, it’s possible to see why.

   Cooper Island Divoky began tracking Mandt's Black Guillemots here in
   the 1970s, and he watched their numbers grow for two decades. Today,
   the island hosts half as many pairs as in 1990. Extent of sea ice in

1: Because the Arctic is warming, sea ice is farther away during the summer
breeding season.

   Cooper Island was once ideally situated for Mandt's Black Guillemots,
   which hunt along the sea-ice edge. But since 2003, offshore waters have
   grown warmer and more ice-free by September—and less favorable to prey.

2: Arctic cod are following the ice north, so Mandt’s Black Guillemots must
rely on fourhorn sculpin.

   Arctic cod tend to track the ice edge, where they feed on plankton
   common along the edges. When sea ice is near Cooper Island, Mandt’s
   Black Guillemots feed the cod to their young almost exclusively. But in
   the widening open sea, guillemots catch fourhorn sculpin instead.
   Sculpin are the same size as cod, but their bonier bodies are more
   difficult to digest.

   From 1975 through 2002, cod dominated chicks' diets for the entire
   season. But since 2003, the dominent prey has shifted mid-summer to
   sculpin each year except for 2006. When sculpin take the place of cod,
   chicks grow more slowly—and more of them starve.

4: And guillemots have more predators, too.

   As Arctic waters have warmed, polar bears that used to hunt from atop
   the sea ice have made their way to Cooper Island instead, and the
   number of Horned Puffins has also increased—with deadly consequences
   for guillemot chicks. In 2009, puffins and polar bears together took 80
   percent of the chicks. They've killed fewer chicks since 2011, when
   Divoky installed predator-resistant plastic nest cases for the birds.

5: Too few chicks survive, so the numbers drop.

   With worse food sources and more predators, fewer chicks than ever are
   fledging from Cooper Island. Today, each breeding pair fledges 0.5
   guillemots annually on average—far behind the 1.1 needed to hold the
   population steady.

   E

   very day goes about the same on Cooper Island. We get up, share
   breakfast in the cabin, and begin the rounds: visiting every nest to
   check up on the chicks’ growth.

   Divoky gingerly lays his shotgun on the ground, then sits cross-legged
   in front of a nest and slowly lifts its lid until rasping peeps resound
   from the interior—that’s the chicks. Working quickly, he scoops up a
   black fluffball, places it in a bag to weigh it, scribbles its weight
   in his notebook, presses its wing to a six-inch ruler, scribbles its
   length in his notebook, and then releases the chick back to its nest.
   He repeats the process with the second chick, if there is one.

   When a guillemot chick hatches, it weighs 35 grams (a little over an
   ounce). To survive its first winter at sea, it needs to bulk up by an
   order of magnitude, reaching 350 grams within five weeks, and grow
   wings long enough to navigate rough waters—rapid development requiring
   a lot of fish to fuel it. Mandt’s Black Guillemots, a subspecies that
   lives wedged between Alaska and Russia along the sea ice edge,
   specialize in one fish: Arctic cod. They’re fatty and common and easy
   to find because they feast on plankton blooming at the ice edge, a
   visible landmark. Parents spend their days winging to the ice to catch
   cod and ferrying it back to insatiable chicks. To keep track of the
   parents’ comings and goings, Divoky added a few data-collection gadgets
   in recent years: geolocators to follow their locations year-round and,
   during the breeding season, time-depth recorders to let him calculate
   how far, how deep, and how often guillemot parents dive to chase fish.

   For many summers, he did all this work himself, but now he gets outside
   help during the busiest weeks. Often crouched beside him in early
   August is Penelope Chilton, a field technician who’s worked with Divoky
   for a decade, or Erin Brown, a McGill University undergrad and Cooper
   first-timer. As he goes through the rounds, he relates stories about a
   nest’s prior inhabitants: “Over 22 years, WOGy [named for its
   white-orange-gray leg bands] was the only vertebrate I saw annually,
   because sometimes I didn’t see my family members, and I had different
   girlfriends. WOGy was the constant.” Or he narrates the chicks’
   relative progress: “The chicks aren’t gaining weight like they did
   yesterday. But then all the world’s carbon would be caught up in
   guillemot chicks.”

   The monotonous routine, performed the same way for decades, makes for a
   uniquely detailed dataset. “The strength of George’s work has been in
   his utter tenacity to go back and go back and go back and get those
   data every year,” says Julia Parrish, a University of Washington
   ecologist who studies seabirds as monitors of ocean health. She
   compares him to the carbon-dioxide sensor near the peak of the
   13,680-foot-high Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa that documents the rise of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide as the infamous Keeling Curve. “That is a
   long-term dataset collected year in and year out in the same way and in
   the same place,” she says. “Applying that same technique to
   biodiversity means that researchers have to be there. The number of
   people in the world who are willing to do that is vanishingly rare, and
   George is one of them.”

   its ankle. His location data show that the birds closely track the sea
   ice edge when they're not on Cooper Island. Photo: Peter Mather

   His study also has particular power because of dumb luck: It happens to
   cover a period of rapid atmospheric warming. Most scientists studying
   the biological impacts of climate change can’t define “normal” for a
   given species or ecosystem, and now it’s too late; the effects are
   manifest. But Divoky spent his first 28 years following individual
   birds, individual chicks, their partners, their offspring, through
   their entire lives—surely enough data to describe a normal, functioning
   Mandt’s Black Guillemot colony. “At one point, he had the whole story
   told in his mind,” says Stan Senner, vice president of bird
   conservation for Audubon’s Pacific Flyway and Divoky’s long-time
   friend. “The birds are there, the ice is near shore, the cod are
   associated with the ice, the birds don’t have to go very far, they get
   the cod. Life is good.”

   Then everything changed. For the first 28 years of Divoky’s study,
   chicks ate cod almost exclusively. But in 2003 parents began serving
   fourhorn sculpin, an ugly fish with a lumpy head and spiny fins. Divoky
   would find chicks choked dead with enormous sculpin lodged in their
   throats. Parents eventually learned to catch smaller sculpin, but
   chicks still suffered. “It takes a long time to break down all that
   cartilaginous mass” in sculpin fins, Divoky says. Just one fish is
   enough to fill a chick’s stomach. “It’s like, ‘I can’t get anything
   else down, I’ve still got the last sculpin head in my stomach.’"

   The ensuing hunger makes siblings turn aggressive: In many nests the
   larger chick bullies the smaller one, sometimes to starvation. As we
   examine one nest, Divoky points to matted, thin feathers on the back of
   one beta’s neck—physical evidence of aggression. Under the sculpin
   regime, chicks grow more slowly and fledge at less than 300 grams.
   Nearly one quarter starve in their nests.

   on the gravel after being removed from its nest. Out of 120 chicks that
   hatched this summer, only 45 fledged. Photo: Peter Mather

   It’s an ugly scene, but the parents are doing their best as they face a
   novel Arctic landscape. The sea ice that previously drifted and
   persisted near the island through the summer is now melted and
   effectively gone—sometimes hundreds of miles away—by August or even
   July. Arctic cod can’t survive in warm water south of the ice, and
   guillemot parents can’t fly fast enough to make additional trips to the
   edge every day. So they’ve decided that more sculpin, for all its
   faults, is a better bet than fewer cod. “This is a pivotal time,”
   Divoky says. “You can see the size of the chicks now. They need all the
   energy they can get. And the primary prey is gone.”

   Seabird parents at other colonies face the same conundrum as Cooper’s
   guillemots. Four-hundred miles southeast is Herschel Island, where
   Cameron Eckert, a conservation biologist at the Yukon Department of
   Environment, monitors the descendants of Mandt’s Black Guillemots found
   nesting beneath floorboards in the 1970s. There, the birds switched
   from Arctic cod to eelblennies, “and when they get desperate, they
   switch to sculpin,” Eckert says. Another 1,600 miles southeast is Coats
   Island, in north Hudson Bay, where Kyle Elliott, a McGill University
   ecologist (and Erin Brown’s thesis advisor), studies Thick-billed
   Murres who switched from cod to capelin, a lower-calorie fish.

   “What we’re seeing is not necessarily about where we’re studying. It’s
   happening across the Arctic,” Elliott says. “They’re able to switch to
   other prey, but the population is declining. These really are
   Arctic-cod species. And as the ice disappears and [the birds’] range
   moves farther north, eventually they’ll be squeezed out at the top.”

   If seabirds are barometers of ocean health, then Arctic birds are
   screaming that there’s a major shift in the system, a shift so extreme
   the barometers themselves are now changing. Make no mistake: These
   seabirds, and other species across the Arctic, are entering a period of
   rapid natural selection that will lead to either their extinction or
   evolution.

Make no mistake: These seabirds, and other species across the Arctic, are
entering a period of rapid natural selection that will lead to their
extinction or evolution.


   Mandt’s Black Guillemots, the ice-adapted subspecies of Black
   Guillemot, likely evolved some 25,000 years ago, according to evidence
   from mitochondrial DNA. Their speciation may have been triggered by a
   very different evolutionary bottleneck. During the last ice age,
   glaciers blanketed the north. Divoky speculates that most ancestral
   Black Guillemots who found themselves iced in couldn’t survive the new
   conditions, but a small number may have had an advantage: They could
   find Arctic cod in small cracks in the ice. In short, they adapted and
   evolved, and today descendants of those survivors nest on Cooper
   Island.

   Now the population is marching through another bottleneck, except this
   time it’s caused by warming, and this time the survivors will be birds
   who can hunt for anything besides cod. “There are guillemots here who
   have just gotten by,” Divoky says. “But when crunch time comes, it’s
   going to be the ones that are really fit [that survive]. And this is
   crunch time.”

   A

   t 9 one evening, after a meal of beans, rice, and rehydrated mushrooms
   cooked on the cabin’s two-burner stove, I stand outside and squint at a
   clump of snow about three-quarters of a mile from camp. There isn’t any
   snow on the island, though, and the clump is moving, which means one
   thing: polar bear. Its bum is muddy, its white coat tinted brown. It
   glances up, distracted, at Arctic Terns dive-bombing overhead as it
   climbs atop a green mound of beach ryegrass. Its hips relax; its
   shoulders press into the ground; and finally its head rests on its
   front paws.

   “You think a polar bear is scary. But then you see them all tuckered
   out,” Divoky says. “It’s like, ‘I’m not going to die, and all I can do
   now is sleep because I’m just exhausted.’”

   Most polar bears used to hunt seals on the ice all summer long. But
   over the past 16 years, the average Beaufort Sea summer gained 36 days
   of open water, and more bears have been coming ashore, spending an
   extra 31 days on land to match. To travel between land and ice, they
   sometimes undertake monumental swims; one GPS-tracked mother swam 420
   miles in nine days, non-stop. When they reach land, they’re ready for a
   nap. And when they wake, they’re hungry.

   A guillemot chick is chump change compared to an ice seal, but these
   are desperate times. In 2002 12 polar bears visited Cooper Island—more
   than double the total number Divoky observed in his first 26 years. He
   installed his 8-by-12-foot fortress the very next year, a worthwhile
   endeavor because the bears haven’t relented. Except for 2006, a
   particularly cold year, when even Arctic cod were plentiful, bears have
   been constant features of Cooper’s landscape—and constant terrors for
   the guillemots. Every summer, bears raid nests to snack on chicks and
   any adults they can catch.

   As a result, guillemots, themselves coping with climate-change-induced
   food scarcity, must also cope with the fallout as other species adapt,
   and not just polar bears. In the mid-1980s, Horned Puffins migrated
   north from subarctic waters and began nesting on Cooper Island. Like
   Black Guillemots, Horned Puffins nest in crevices, which are scarce in
   the open water north of Alaska, and any tunnel excavated in permafrost
   will warm and collapse on itself. So puffins compete with the
   guillemots for territory, and do so aggressively, even killing chicks.
   “It’s gruesome, to have an older chick that’s almost ready to fledge
   and it looked like someone took vice grips and just crushed the skull,”
   Divoky says. In 2009 the pressure from the pair of interlopers
   overwhelmed the colony: From 184 hatched chicks, polar bears killed 90,
   and Horned Puffins killed 81. A single chick fledged.

   Enough was enough: If Divoky got a bunker, the birds should get
   bunkers, too. In 2011, he destroyed the wooden nest sites and replaced
   them with plastic cases with guillemot-sized holes cut into the sides.
   The cases aren’t entirely resistant to polar-bear
   intrusions—occasionally a bear manages to shake a chick free—but bears
   don’t have the thumbs required to unclip the lid. “I wouldn’t [put out
   the cases] if I thought it would make any difference in polar bear
   survival,” Divoky says. “But if they’re opening [a chick’s] body cavity
   and only eating the livers, what good can it be doing?”

   birds socialize and rest when they're not hunting or incubating. Photo:

   Additionally, he reasons, his study’s value in documenting
   climate-change adaptation is too great to sacrifice to a few hungry
   bears. “I’m not trying to conserve [guillemots]; I’m trying to study
   them,” he says. “I had to do the cases to study them.”

   Divoky and the birds have bunkers, but the rest of the island’s human
   inhabitants are stuck in tents. Our encampment is surrounded by what
   Divoky calls a “polar-bear-proof” electric fence, but the fence is
   barely a meter high; it’s not hard to imagine a bear plowing right
   through it. So I sleep with a shotgun by my side and hope that if the
   worst comes to pass, someone else fires first.

   At 5 o’clock one morning, Divoky’s voice crackles through the
   walkie-talkie: “Polar bear outside camp.” I extract myself from my
   sleeping bag, hurriedly lace up my boots, stumble outside, and freeze:
   There, not 20 feet away, The Bear rolls through the mist. What can only
   be a primal fear response sublimates my thoughts. My entire being
   focuses on the predator; space and time still. I don’t remember that I
   left my gun inside the tent.

   The bear doesn’t even pause to investigate. It marches across Cooper
   Island, sniffing at the occasional plastic case, before it disappears
   back into the sea.

   After my primal terror subsides, I feel only sympathy. The bear, like
   countless Arctic animals facing novel, warmer environments, is merely
   trying to survive. “I don’t know what it is one can do” to help these
   animals, Audubon’s Senner says. “In the end you circle back to the
   idea: ‘Well, we have to do what we can to reduce carbon emissions.’ You
   want to try and maintain areas like the coastal plain of the Arctic
   National Wildlife Refuge, where the wildlife at least have a chance to
   adapt to changing conditions free from the stress of industrial
   development. And you want to have big areas that are protected to give
   birds as much opportunity as possible for their own Plan B and Plan C.”

   All they need, then, is space and time.

   T

   his summer, half of Cooper’s nests failed, and nearly all of the
   remaining nests fledged a single underweight alpha. Each day, our nest
   checks turn up dead chicks. When we discover my first, Divoky kneels in
   the gravel, cradles the limp bird, its black fluff matted, in his
   hands, and then delicately tears its breast open like the skin on
   rotten fruit. Its stomach is empty.

   Somehow, from all this death emerges something like hope: six parents,
   paired into three couples, who have the makings of survivors. “There
   were six individuals who were reproducing like it was 1979,” Divoky
   tells me after his return to civilization in September. “And they
   weren’t just getting two chicks out the door: One of them had a
   400-gram chick!”

   the video to give it a whirl. Video: Peter Mather

   Those birds, and others like them, may be the future of the species. If
   those chicks thrived because of advantageous genes—maybe the chicks can
   process sculpin, or the parents are generalists who can hunt in open
   water—they’ll pass those genes on to their progeny. Maybe those genes
   will lead some birds through the bottleneck and into the next iteration
   of Mandt’s Black Guillemots. “It would be both very interesting and
   very depressing to see the colony get down to less than 10 pairs, but
   10 pairs who can figure things out,” Divoky says.

Divoky kneels in the gravel, cradles the limp bird, its black fluff matted,
in his hands, and then delicately tears its breast open like the skin on
rotten fruit. Its stomach is empty.


   Whoever those survivors might be, Divoky will know them intimately,
   including detailed growth and survival data for every chick they’ve
   raised, and likely the histories of their parents, too. “He probably
   knows most or all individuals on the island,” says Christophe Barbraud,
   a population ecologist at the National Center for Scientific Research
   in Paris. In June Barbraud was awarded funding to analyze long-term
   datasets on eight Arctic and Antarctic species as they adapt to climate
   change—including Divoky’s guillemots. Next year a postdoctoral
   researcher will be dedicated to Divoky’s dataset full-time. “His
   dataset is huge,” Barbraud says. “I’m not sure one postdoc will be
   enough, but at least we’ll start.”

   This is potentially groundbreaking work, the first step in
   understanding how populations and species adapt to rapid climate
   change—and whether people can do anything to help them. “That is not a
   system that we’re going to maintain by flying in frozen fish for all
   the chicks,” Parrish, the seabird ecologist, says. “You can provide
   great nesting habitat, but you actually can’t make the ice closer. You
   might be able to ward off a bear here and there, but the large-scale
   changes that are also making those predators hungrier—that’s going to
   overwhelm.”

   “There’s a point at which the world is going to overwhelm George and
   overwhelm that colony,” she continues. “He’s going to end up on a
   barrier island with no birds and/or a barrier island that’s underwater.
   We know that’s going to happen. He knows it, too. And it doesn’t stop
   him.”

   Indeed, Divoky is already fundraising for his nonprofit Friends of
   Cooper Island to gather as much data as possible during these crucial
   years of adaptation. He’s hoping to continue his work on Cooper Island
   until at least 2025, the 50th anniversary of his study as well as the
   year when some models predict an ice-free Arctic summer.

   Really, though, the renewed urgency is only an excuse; Divoky would
   return regardless. He didn’t dedicate his life to Cooper Island to
   document the effects of climate change; it’s something that happened to
   him—and the birds—along the way. He returns because guillemots comprise
   a significant part of his social circle, and because he needs to know
   what happens next. “To maintain a long-term relationship, you have to
   keep things interesting,” Divoky says, “and Cooper Island has stayed
   interesting.”

   Important Bird Areas. Across this expansive flyway, such iconic bird
   species as the Greater Sage Grouse, Sandhill Crane, and Yellow-billed
   Cuckoo drive Audubon's work to protect threatened ecosystems.
