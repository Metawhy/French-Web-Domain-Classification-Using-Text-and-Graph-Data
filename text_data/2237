All Aboard! 15 Modern Houseboats, Boatels & More Floating Architecture

   Article by SA Rogers, filed under Houses & Residential in the
   Architecture category
   [seahorse-villa-2-960x627.jpeg]

   Often designed with potential climate-change-induced flooding in mind,
   these houseboats, floating hotels and other water-based structures
   prove you don’t need land to live a life of luxury. The projects
   include a boat acting as a camera obscura, a structure that turns
   seasonal flooding into an opportunity for fun, an apartment complex on
   the waters of Amsterdam and an update on Dubai’s seemingly fantastical
   Seahorse Villa vacation homes.

Guntû Floating Hotel in the Seto Island Sea

   With its gabled roof and wooden construction, Guntû by architect
   Yasushi Horibe could easily be built somewhere on land almost exactly
   as it is. The luxury floating hotel features gorgeous passenger suites
   looking out onto the water along with a range of high-end amenities.
   You won’t find any of the typical ugly plastic cruise ship surfaces
   here; everything is lined with timber for the feeling of home.

Atelier LAVIT’s Floating Hotel in France

   Ten timber structures float on the surface of a lake in southeastern
   France, near the city of Avignon. The Narcissus project by Atelier
   LAVIT is an eco-hotel with a structure that aims to “evoke primitive
   buildings on the shore of the lake; floating on the water like rafts or
   on pilotis like palafittes [stilt houses].”

2BOATS: Floating Photographic Platforms Travel Europe

   One is a charming wooden shack, made of scraps, looking like something
   a fisherman would build. The other, the Obscurabus, is almost invisible
   in the water. Together they form ‘2BOATS,’ floating photo studios
   meandering their way through Europe’s rivers and canals to see the
   continent from a unique perspective. The wooden one, by Claudius
   Schulze, hosts workshops and discussions, while Maciej Markowicz’s
   creation is an oversized camera obscura.

3 Nautilus Hausbootes

   A company called Nautilus makes a series of ‘hausbootes’ in various
   sizes, including the Nautino Mini, the Nautino Maxi, the Nautino
   Adventure, the Vagabund, the EI-Home and the Nautilus. Pictured here
   are the latter three. Each one boasts an eye-catching design and
   multiple terraces; check out the screened roof hatch on top of the
   Nautilus, which can host up to 8 adults and 2 children. The Vagabund is
   more compact, suited for smaller families or for use as a floating
   office, while the EI-Home is a more robust residence.

Hello Good Buy: Black Friday Outside The Box

   Article by Steve, filed under Guerilla Ads & Marketing in the Design
   category

   Black Friday
   Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, marks the
   unofficial start of the annual Christmas shopping season in a big, bad,
   bargain-hunting way!

A History Of Hysteria

   Black Friday history (images via: Carter BloodCare and Market Oracle)

   Black Friday may be a very modern socioeconomic phenomenon but it has a
   long and convoluted history dating back to September 24th, 1869 when
   plunging gold prices triggered a stock market panic… hold on, that may
   not be the Black Friday we’re discussing here.

   Fast forward to 1966 when the Philadelphia Police Department, dreading
   the approach of yet another chaotic post-Thanksgiving shopping frenzy,
   dubbed the infamous event Black Friday. Within a decade the term was
   being applied to similar shop-a-paloozas busting out all over the USA,
   Canada, the UK and more!

   Black Friday history (images via: The Truth About Cars and Brenternet)

   By 1980, retailers began to use Black Friday as a convenient term for
   the point where red ink turned to black: losses to profits, in other
   words. It took a while for both sides of the economic equation to get
   in sync over Black Friday, however, but when they did some good things
   happened. In 2003, Black Friday officially grabbed top billing as the
   Busiest Shopping Day of the year and although it slipped to second
   place in 2004, Black Friday’s been King of the Hill ever since. No
   offense, Hank.

Lines & Tents & Buyers, Oh My!

   Black Friday lineup (images via: Visit Minot and Now Public)

   Unlike the more recent emergence of Cyber Monday, Black Friday makes
   itself apparent by the appearance and behavior of the people doing the
   actual shopping. Up close and personal, take no prisoners, in your face
   shopping the likes of which the world has never witnessed! Thanks to
   teh intarwebs, we all can witness these aspects vicariously beginning
   with the long (in length and in time) lineups snaking down the streets
   outside various big box stores.

   Black Friday lineup Target (images via: Jabeta, Examiner and
   999ThePoint)

   Stoked by advertising on television, in newspaper flyers, on the radio
   and online, shoppers eager not to let those juicy bargains slip through
   their fingers stake out prime spots outside their targeted stores
   (possibly including Target).

   Black Friday lineup (image via: Citizenside)

   Whether in rows of tents or standing in single file, Black Friday
   shoppers are a remarkably orderly bunch for the most part. All that
   changes once the doors open, however, then it’s every man, woman, child
   and cat for themselves.

Rush OWWer

   Insider, Goodlawd and Times Newspapers Limited)

   Stampedes not seen since the great cattle drives of the 19th century or
   the great Hindu festivals of the 20th burst into fluid motion as each
   store’s official Black Friday opening hours strike, and if you were
   lucky enough to be among the first in line outside you’d better not be
   unlucky enough to trip and fall once the human avalanche gathers steam
   and begins its unstoppable roll. In such situations people easily lose
   their heads, not to mention their wigs.

   Island Newsday and NY Daily News)

   Shoppers aren’t alone in looking danger in the eyes once the doors
   swing open – store staff attempting to ensure safety for all by
   directing the flow often find themselves in the wrong place at the
   wrong time. The most well-known and certainly most tragic such incident
   took place at a Valley Stream, NY WalMart store on November 28th of
   2008 just after 5:00AM.

   Black Friday WalMart (image via: StarzLife)

   As the store doors opened, hundreds of cold, impatient and uncaring
   shoppers busted the entrance door right off its hinges in their
   desperate search for bargains. One 34-year old Wal-Mart employee was
   unable to avoid the furious flood of shoppers and was trampled to
   death.

Posts With The Most: 12 Cool & Creative Traffic Bollards

   Article by Steve, filed under Street Art & Graffiti in the Art category
   [Traffic-Bollards-Leicester-1-960x720.jpg]

   Never mind the bollards? Uh-uh: these traffic stoppers halt wayward
   vehicles like no traffic cone can. The best bollards, though, are
   designed to look great!

   Traffic Bollards Leicester 3

   Leicester City Council faced a conundrum in early 2014: children
   walking to and from Whitehall Primary school were endangered by
   vehicular road traffic. The street had no sidewalks; only a row of
   metal traffic bollards. The council’s ingenious solution was to modify
   the bollards to look like children, many wearing the school’s red
   uniforms. Kudos to Flickr user KiranParmar for capturing these kinda
   creepy “Stepford Children” in their native habitat.

   Not only do the modified bollards remind drivers to be aware of
   pedestrians, the scheme is much cheaper than laying down sidewalks. One
   would hope older ex-students don’t try to re-enact the infamous mailbox
   scene from the 1993 film Dazed and Confused… a metal bollard beats a
   wooden baseball bat every time.

Lean Design

   Leaning Tower Pisa Traffic Bollard

   “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,” and when traffic tilts
   your traffic bollard, make it look like the Leaning Tower of Pisa of
   course! Kate McGovern snapped this tilted but still functional bollard
   somewhere in Philadelphia. Compromised or not, the bollard seems in
   better shape than the surrounding pavement while providing some
   unexpected visual interest.

Minions Of Bollards

   Who knew the 2010 movie Despicable Me was so popular… in Penang,
   Malaysia! Located on Soo Hong Lane off Armenian Street in Penang’s
   inner George Town neighborhood, the charming street art installation
   was painted by Lithuanian-born artist Ernest Zacharevic early in 2013
   as part of a city-sanctioned campaign to beautify Soo Hong Lane.
   Unfortunately, Zacharevic had to be recalled to repaint at least one of
   the not-so-despicable bollards which was defaced – literally – by
   vandals.

   One popular bollard design features a narrowed area near the top to
   facilitate the attachment of ropes, chains and the like.
   Coincidentally, these particular bollards bear a cursory resemblance to
   LEGO men… and a little artistry (plus some yellow paint) enhances the
   effect even more. The oddly one-eyed LEGO men bollards above come to us
   courtesy of French street artist Le CyKlop (which explains much) and
   can be found along the Canal de l’Ourcq in Paris

   Every article in the WebUrbanist archives falls into exactly one of
   five main categories and one of five subcategories within each main
   category. Below you will find all thirty resulting categories, from
   broad subjects to more specific sub-sections.

   Architecture is the art we live in, from individual houses, apartments
   and condos to skyscrapers, parks and cities. Expect amazing real
   buildings as well as stunning conceptual designs, underground
   structures to towering spires.

   Abandoned Places: Real-life urban exploration and building infiltration
   can be challenging, dangerous and even illegal. Here is a chance to try
   your hand at urbex from the comfort of your computer, virtually
   visiting abandoned buildings, towns and cities.

   Cities & Urbanism: Beyond classic ideas of city construction lie
   shocking suburban sprawl, brilliant urban renewal and liminal spaces in
   between. Many of these are projects on the fringe, sometimes literally
   – obscure, offbeat, ingenious and inventive.

   Houses & Residential: Waking, sleeping, loving and living, we spend so
   much time at home it seems a shame not to make your place of residence
   both functional and unique. These dwelling designs will shock, amaze,
   intrigue and inspire your own projects.

   Offices & Commercial: Working, recreating, traveling or shopping,
   private spaces outside the home occupy much of our lives. Hopefully we
   can all aspire to occupy such stunning offices, stores, hotels,
   restaurants and bars as those found here.

   Public & Institutional: Civic structures shape our cities. From
   sensational schools, colleges and universities to magnificent museums,
   theaters and opera halls, the best stand out from the crowd as objects
   rather than infill, signal amid noise.

   Art is meant to be shared. Urban art inspires us in part because it is
   open to the public, subject to discourse, real and immediate. Check out
   our extensive collection of artworks gathered from around the world,
   from artists both veteran and innovative.

   Drawing & Digital: Novel twists on existing traditions emerge as new
   tools and unique techniques allow artists to draw, paint and illustrate
   in fresh ways, from computer-generated wonders of three-dimensional
   realism to fresh forms of abstraction.

   Installation & Sound: Art on the wall is one thing, but installations
   engage us with texture, light, colors and sounds, surrounding us and
   begging for interaction. Many challenge conventions of the art world as
   well as the context of art itself.

   Photography & Video: Using everything from trash-can cams to pinhole
   cameras to high-tech digital devices, these photographers and
   cinematographers will amaze you with mind-bending techniques in static
   images and fluid movies alike.

   Sculpture & Craft: From public works to private masterpieces, refined
   sculptures to clever crafts, here are some of the most beautiful,
   strange, surreal and sublime examples of physical art projects not made
   merely for hanging on walls.

   Street Art & Graffiti: From 3D graffiti to light art, these works
   reflect the cutting edge of contemporary urban expression. Expect
   unique techniques, creative materials, and unusual strategies
   challenging conventions like stencils and spray paint.

   Design exists at the intersection of art and function, with objects
   that derive beauty in part from appearance but also from use. Graphic,
   furniture, industrial and interior designs here are typically atypical,
   envelope-pushing creations that turn traditions on end.

   Fixtures & Interiors: If you want to change spaces, moving may not be
   the answer – from nuts-and-bolts appliances and fixtures to materials,
   surfaces and finishes, single objects to entire rooms, here are some
   inspirational and ideas for interiors.

   Furniture & Decor: Beyond the broad strokes, details are what really
   make or break living spaces. Explore unique and offbeat furnishings
   (including tables, desks, chairs and more) for bedrooms, bathrooms,
   dining rooms and home offices.

   Graphics & Branding: For those who love logos and layouts, these
   posters, typographies and illustrations (both online and offline)
   involve subtle twists and double meanings. Many have won both
   mainstream and independent awards.

   Guerrilla Ads & Marketing: Once offbeat and now commonplace, guerrilla
   tactics allow advertisers and activists to reach audiences when and
   where they least expect it, whether they mean to sell or convince you
   of something.

   Products & Packaging: In a world of shiny new toys, the design of
   containers has become in many cases as important as the objects within.
    These industrial designs show the range of potential inside wrappers,
   boxes, bags and more.

   Technology: Innovations, creations and aberrations found here are meant
   to incite conversations about the past, present and future
   relationships of humans and the technologies that permeate the human
   experience in ever-more-unpredictable and amazing ways.

   Concepts & Prototypes:  The future is now, but it does not end here.
   Here you will find concept technologies and designs that are much
   closer than most people realize, including exciting inventions ready to
   make the leap from virtual to actual reality.

   Gadgets & Geekery: From cool new toys to geeky memes, these articles
   are less about a subject than about a mentality or demographic – those
   of us who appreciate nerdy math or physics humor, geek graffiti and
   scientific silliness in general.

   Gaming & Computing: For the more serious gamer and technophile, these
   vintage adverts, classic games, new systems and computers are for the
   dedicated fans who enjoy inside jokes as well as innovative software
   and hardware.

   Vehicles & Mods: Despite the rise of location-independent digital
   technologies, we still live in a physical world with fixed geographies.
   These art cars, vehicle hacks and futuristic rides are about more than
   getting from point A to point B.

   Vintage & Retro: And for those who enjoy the fast-paced history and
   evolution of technology, there is nothing like a trip down memory lane.
   Here are visions of the future past, and ideas that once seemed
   inevitable that may never come to pass.

   Travel: Step outside of your comfort zone to research wonders of the
   world and boutique hotels, or go on an adventure with parkour, free
   running, building jumping and rooftopping. This section is for
   cosmopolitan globetrotters seeking something off the beaten path.

   7 Wonders Series: Largely responsible for launching WebUrbanist to fame
   in the first place, these articles go beyond the original (and new) 7
   Wonders of the World into the realm of deserted cities, remote islands,
   engineering marvels and more.

   Boutique & Art Hotels: Whether you want to travel the world in luxury
   and style or immerse yourself in local vernacular, there is sure to be
   a unique, offbeat and amazing hostel, tree hotel or underwater resort
   in this section to suit your desires.

   Culture & Cuisine: Finding a place to stay is only half the fun. From
   restaurants and bars to and art and architecture, skip the tourist
   stops in your guide book and delve right into the local dive pub,
   kitsch cafe or other attraction to get the full experience.

   Destinations & Sights: Picking exotic destinations is as much an art as
   science. Many of the locations suggested here are the out-of-the-way,
   world-of-mouth wonders most travelers miss when reading through
   conventional articles and typical websites.

   Urban Exploration:  From building jumping and roof-topping to planking,
   parkour and free running, these images and videos of the breathtaking
   infiltrations and explorations show unusual and clever ways to interact
   with urban environments.

   menu bar (above) or access the category system below via the drop-down
   menu on the sidebar (right) from any page of the site.

Meal of Worms: Kitchen Farm for Growing Edible Insects at Home

   Article by Urbanist, filed under Products & Packaging in the Design
   category
   [insect-meal-worms-960x686.jpg]

   Helping you grow and harvest edible mealworms right on your kitchen
   counter, the world’s first desktop-sized insect hive aims to aid a
   rebranding of an unpopular but nutrient-rich source of protein.

   edible insect farm

   The Livin Farm by Katharina Unger and Julia Kaisinger is just a few two
   feet tall and contains eight shelves for housing mealworms at various

   savings is: less space, water and energy are needed for this system to
   work.
