   Buy shoes that are comfortable, no matter what the size says. If the
   shoe is described as exactly your size and proper width, that doesn’t
   necessarily mean it’s going to fit you comfortably. The maker, style
   and material can all affect how a shoe fits, so go with what feels
   best.

   Always consider comfort as well as style when you pick out your wedding
   day shoes. The fact is that you will be on your feet for long periods
   of time, so you don’t want to be in pain. Indeed, you could even buy a
   couple of pairs, one for the ceremony and another for the reception.

   When shopping for a new pair of shoes, select a size in the shoe you
   want that fits the larger foot. Nobody’s feet are exactly the same size
   and one is usually a little larger. Make sure the shoes are comfortable
   on the larger foot before you make the decision to buy.

   There is no reason to buy a shoe with a heel higher than three and a
   half inches! You can look sexy and be comfortable as long as you stick
   to a height which you can actually walk in. Breaking your ankle as you
   attempt to navigate a brick walkway doesn’t look pretty on anyone.

   Fashionable shoes can ruin your feet, so to protect them, wear properly
   fitting, comfortable, flat shoes. If you take care of your feet, you
   will not only be in less pain when you do wear dress shoes, but your
   feet will look better in sandals as well, leaving you healthy and
   happy.

   No matter how cute a pair of shoes may be, do not purchase them if they
   do not fit. Some people think that their shoes will eventually stretch
   to fit their feet comfortable. The truth is that this usually does not
   happen; the shoes will still be snug after many uses.

   When shopping for a pair of shoes, try to go as late in the day as
   possible. At the beginning of the day, you have not been on your feet a
   lot. So, you have no idea how shoes will fit later in the day. This
   means your shoes may not fit comfortable in the later hours.

   If you want to buy shoes which will stand the test of time, shopping at
   discount stores won’t provide you with the best investment. Higher end
   brands provide shoes which are not only durable, but also comfortable.
   When you buy an expensive pair, you are investing in a long life.
