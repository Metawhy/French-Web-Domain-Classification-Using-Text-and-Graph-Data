Reproduction rights

   In accordance with public intellectual property law, in particular
   Article L. 122-5 of the French Intellectual Property Code, there is no
   restriction on the reuse of "official documents":
   -   statements, speeches, press packs and communiqués;
   -   circulars, guidelines and other regulatory documents;
   -   CERFA forms.
   As a matter of etiquette, however, any partial or complete reproduction
   of such content should clearly state the author’s name, the source and,
   where relevant, include a link to the original online document on the

   All other content on the embassy website is covered by copyright. Any
   reproduction is therefore subject to the author’s consent in accordance
   with Article L. 122-4 of the French Intellectual Property Code.
   This applies in particular to texts prepared by the embassy staff in
   order to provide the French and foreign public, via the internet, with
   information about the embassy’s activities, about foreign policy in
   general and, more specifically for foreign visitors, with a
   presentation of France. Such content may not be freely reproduced
   without first obtaining permission and without stating the source.
   Such information may be reused for non-commercial, and especially
   educational, purposes provided that the integrity of the information is
   respected, that its meaning, scope or application is not changed in any
   way, and that the origin and date of publication are specified.
   Such information may not be used for commercial or promotional purposes
   without express permission and without obtaining a licence to reuse
   public information. The use of public information to create a product
   or service intended to be made available to third parties, free of
   charge or for valuable consideration, is deemed to constitute reuse for

Hypertext links to the embassy website

   Any public or private website may, without prior permission, establish
   a link (including a deep link) to the information provided by the
   embassy.
   For websites, the authorised reproduction of content must very clearly
   state the document’s origin in the form of an internet address:
   www.ambafrance-uk.org
   The words "All rights reserved" should be added at the bottom of each
   page.
   "Deep links" pointing directly to the desired document should be
   preferred to the reproduction of content.
   In such cases no prior permission is needed to establish links to the
   www.diplomatie.gouv.fr website, though explicit mention of the Ministry

   subject consulted.

What is an RSS feed?

   RSS is an internet content syndication format.
   Syndication is a way of exchanging information (text, links, images)
   between websites, which are automatically updated.
   In particular, it allows a website to display information from another
   site while keeping its own layout and graphic style.
   Whether you are a webmaster or a user of information aggregation
   software, the site offers you a free RSS feed containing the latest
   news published on the homepage. Each link proposed gives the date and
   time of publication, the title of the document and a short summary
   where available.
   To retrieve the RSS feed, click on this icon at the bottom of the
   website page.
   An acronym for Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication, RSS is
   based on the XML standard.
   All RSS files must comply with the XML 1.0 specification published on
   the website of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

   government accessibility guidelines (Référentiel Général d’Accéssiblité

   all, except in the event of force majeure.
   We are committed to constantly improving the accessibility of our
