Mathematicians build code to take on toughest cyber attacks

   March 26, 2015

   By Rebecca Phillips, University Communications science writer

   Hamlin PULLMAN, Wash. – Washington State University mathematicians have
   designed an encryption code capable of fending off the phenomenal
   hacking power of a quantum computer.

   Using high-level number theory and cryptography, the researchers
   reworked an infamous old cipher called the knapsack code to create an
   online security system better prepared for future demands.

   The findings were recently published in the journal The Fibonacci
   Quarterly.

Quantum computers are near

   Quantum computers operate on the subatomic level and theoretically
   provide processing power that is millions, if not billions of times
   faster than silicon-based computers. Several companies are in the race
   to develop quantum computers including Google.

   breaking the Nazi Enigma code, which was also the subject of the recent
   film, “The Imitation Game.” (Photo by Rebecca Phillips, WSU)

   Internet security is no match for a quantum computer, said Nathan
   Hamlin, instructor and director of the WSU Math Learning Center. That
   could spell future trouble for online transactions ranging from buying
   a book on Amazon to simply sending an email.

   Hamlin said quantum computers would have no trouble breaking present
   security codes, which rely on public key encryption to protect the
   exchanges.

   In a nutshell, public key code uses one public “key” for encryption and
   a second private “key” for decoding. The system is based on the
   factoring of impossibly large numbers and, so far, has done a good job
   keeping computers safe from hackers.

   Quantum computers, however, can factor these large numbers very
   quickly, Hamlin said. But problems like the knapsack code slow them
   down.

   Fortunately, many of the large data breaches in recent years are the
   result of employee carelessness or bribes and not of cracking the
   public key encryption code, he said.

A new public key code

   Looking to protect future online information, Hamlin and retired
   mathematics professor William Webb turned to the long-abandoned
   knapsack code. To bring it up to quantum level – and possibly use it as
   a new type of public key encryption – the researchers first engineered
   new numbering systems for the code.

   “We used alternate ways of representing numbers,” said Hamlin.

   In effect, they created new digital systems with much greater
   complexity than society’s day-to-day decimal and binary systems.

   “By using very complicated number strings, we produced a new version of
   the knapsack code that can’t be broken by the usual cyber attack
   methods,” said Webb.

   As a result, Hamlin and Webb believe the redesigned knapsack code could
   offer a viable alternative for public key encryption with quantum
   computing.

Knapsack code

   The knapsack problem is a theoretical puzzle dating back to at least
   1897 and is very difficult to solve in its most general form.

   “Basically, it asks if you have one big number (the knapsack) and lots
   of small numbers (objects), what is the subset of small numbers (or
   objects) that will perfectly fill the knapsack? The concept was used to
   create a code called the knapsack code,” explained Webb.

   “The knapsack code was originally suggested as a tool for public key
   encryption in the 1970s, but it was broken by two different methods and
   people lost interest in it,” he said.

   Webb’s idea to bring it out of storage was at first an intellectual
   exercise.

   “Knapsack is a simple, elegant code but it was broken,” said Webb. “We
   wondered if it could be fixed and redesigned to be secure. The
   challenge was intriguing.”

   Hamlin said they made corrections at the fundamental level of the code,
   which repaired many of its weak spots. This let it block a greater
   array of cyber attacks, including those using basis reduction, one of
   the decoding methods used to break the original knapsack code, he said.

   “Basis reduction is a big hammer to use against this code and, after
   testing, we think it’s secure against this type of attack and would
   offer an alternative code for quantum computing,” Hamlin said.

   Webb said although it still needs outside testing, the remodeled
   knapsack code holds promise for making future online computer
   transactions considerably more secure.

   “Essentially any time you want to send secure messages over the
   Internet, you need a public key code. This is another candidate for a
   useful code,” he said.

   WSU Associate Professor Bala Krishnamoorthy also took part in the
   research.
