North Korea on Friday secured qualification for its first athletes at South
Korea's Pyeongchang Olympics in February when figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and
Kim Ju-Sik finished in the top six in a qualifying event on Friday.

   The pair successfully completed a solid short programme on Thursday and
   produced an even better free skate performance to make sure of one of
   five Olympic qualifying spots on offer with Kim pumping his fists at
   the end of their routine.

   The International Skating Union confirmed to Reuters their
   qualification for Pyeongchang, with Russia and Germany, who were top,
   having already qualified for the Games in South Korea.

   North Korea did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi winter Games.

Kailani Craine keeps her cool to lead Nebelhorn Trophy

   Craine keeps her cool to lead Nebelhorn Trophy

Figure skater Kailani Craine shook off the nerves to take herself to the cusp
of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games after a stunning display in the
Nebelhorn Trophy.

   The Australian national champion stole the show on the second day in
   Germany, setting a new personal best in the ladies' short to take the
   lead ahead of Saturday's free skate.

   Her score of 58.02 points was enough to take her beyond Matilda
   Algotsson of Sweden, she too registering a personal record with a tally
   of 56.91.

   German home favourite Nathalie Weinzierl also took her place on the
   podium in the Olympic qualifying event, sitting in third in her bid to
   go to PyeongChang.

   Craine said: "Of course, I was nervous, because it's an Olympic spot,
   my dream on the line, but I definitely prepared.

     " I couldn't have done anything else in training to prepare for this
     moment. I've been really present in my training and I tried to mimic
     competition in my training."

   Meanwhile, North Korean figure skaters have assured themselves of a
   place in South Korea after Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik finished sixth in
   the pairs programme.

   The pair had sat fifth after Thursday's short programme, with a free
   skate sixth-place effort enough for them to guarantee an Olympic Winter
   Games berth.

   The winners of the Nebelhorn Trophy, Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir
   Morozov of Russia, had already secured their spot thanks to their
   performance at the ISU World Figure Skating Championships 2017.

   The world bronze medallists scored 140.94 points and totalled 218.46
   points to win the event, with Morozov threatening an improved
   performance still to come.

   "It was not 100 per cent yet, but it was our first competetion. It was
   a good way for us to start the season like this in Oberstdorf," he
   said.
