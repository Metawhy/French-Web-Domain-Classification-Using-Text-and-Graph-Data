Double Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu to miss worlds

   Double Olympic champion Hanyu to miss worlds

Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, who last month became the first male in 66 years to win
back-to-back Olympic gold medals in men's figure skating, will not defend his
world title later this month, the Japan Skating Federation said on Wednesday.

   The 23-year-old cast doubt on his participation in Milan after his
   Olympic triumph in Pyeongchang, saying repeatedly that healing the
   right ankle he injured in a training fall late last year was his
   priority.

   "According to the results of a medical examination, I will be unable to
   take part in the worlds," Hanyu said in a statement, thanking his fans
   for their support.

   "I will make every effort to recover as soon as possible through
   treatment and rehabilitation."

   Last week, the double world champion told a news conference that he
   hoped to eventually successfully land a quintuple jump and break the
   five-spin barrier.

Alina Zagitova edges Evgenia Medvedeva in Russian battle for women's figure

Alina Zagitova edged compatriot Evgenia Medvedeva to become the women's
figure skating champion and claim a first gold in Pyeongchang for the Olympic
Athletes from Russia.

   The OAR pair could not be separated in Friday’s free skate, though it
   was Zagitova’s superior short-program score which handed the
   15-year-old gold at the expense of the two-time reigning world
   champion.

   A valiant display from Kaetlyn Osmond saw the Canadian take bronze,
   though the seven-point difference between herself and second-placed
   Medvedeva highlighted the Russian duo’s dominance on the ice.

   The stunning showdown between Zagitova and Medvedeva began on
   Wednesday, where the short-program world record was broken twice.

   Medvedeva had initially claimed it with an 81.61, but it soon belonged
   to Zagitova when she posted 82.92 barely 15 minutes later.

   It meant Zagitova had a slender lead of 1.31 points going into Friday’s
   free skate, and she was able to put the pressure on her team-mate when
   going out third last – with Osmond sandwiched between the duo as the
   penultimate skater, having scored 78.87 with her short-program routine.

   Zagitova’s 156.65 in the free skate saw her total 239.57, laying down
   the score to beat for the final two skaters.

   As expected, Osmond’s 152.15 saw her slot into second, and quite
   staggeringly, Medvedeva went on to score an identical 156.65 to finish
   with the silver medal.

   The points difference from the short program ultimately handed gold to
   Zagitova, who became the second youngest figure skating champion after
   American Tara Lipinski in 1998.
