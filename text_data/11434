Megan Nielsen Studio Grand Opening!!

   09.30.2019 by Meg // 14 Comments

   Megan Nielsen Patterns Studio Grand Opening!! Megan Nielsen Patterns
   Studio Grand Opening!!

   My friends I feel like I have been waiting years to write this post and
   I’m so excited to final share all about the grand opening of my studio
   space!

   As you know I’ve been working from home for the past 10 years and as
   much as I have loved it, it also came with it’s complications. This
   year I started feeling like we had outgrown the space. There wasn’t
   enough room for me and my team to work comfortably, and I was also
   feeling like I needed a bit more separation of my work and home life.

   When I drove by this space one day I thought it was exactly what I had
   been dreaming of! There is room for my whole team to work comfortably
   and for me to do some things that were never possible in my home
   workspace – like making my workspace open to the public so that we can
   connect more with the local sewing community! I am really loving being
   able to meet so many other makers and share our love of sewing.

   This space allows me to display our pattern samples publicly, which i
   love, because i think makes it so much easier to get your head around
   the details and features of each design when you can hold them and
   touch them.

   As you know I am incredibly passionate about sustainability in fashion
   and sewing, and textile waste is something that is incredibly worrying
   to me. I wanted to be able to offer a sustainable source of fabric to
   Perth makers, so I have been working closely with amazing local fashion
   labels to stock their deadstock fabric from their manufacturing. This
   has been an incredibly satisfying new aspect of my business – seeing
   fabric that was once waste and unused, finding a new use is so
   exciting! I feel like we are creating a little sustainable loop here in
   Perth and i love it!

   I will share a proper tour of our studio once we are fully settled in,
   but for now I thought you might enjoy seeing a few snaps from our grand
   opening a few weeks ago. It was an amazing and overwhelming day with
   over 300 makers visiting the studio there was barely room to move for a
   few hours, and my heart is just so full with the amazing support i’ve
   received from the Perth sewing community. I commissioned local artist
   Chris Nixon to create a gorgeous sewing mural ready for our opening,
   and he did an amazing job and I love how it turned out!! I also ordered
   special logo cookies for the occasion and we had free flowing champagne
   for everyone who stopped by, and it was just such a fun day celebrating
   the opening.

Introducing the Mini Eucalypt woven tank and dress!

   09.11.2019 by Meg // Leave a Comment

   Introducing the Mini Eucalypt woven tank and dress sewing pattern by
   Megan Nielsen!

   This pattern has been in the works so long i’ve actually lost track of
   how long – but I am so excited to be able to share it with you now!

   Mini Eucalypt is a hardworking wardrobe staple woven tank top and dress
   pattern. This is absolutely 100% the most used kids pattern in my
   house. I have used it to make my girls endless summer tops and dresses
   and even pajamas! I’ve hacked it to make gathered dresses and crop tops
   and it’s basically the base i start with when i make them anything
   woven.

   This is a fantastic beginner pattern that will help you learn new
   techniques or if you’re an experienced sewer, is a super quick and
   satisfying make. It uses very little little fabric and is my favourite
   way to use up my scraps – i turn them into bias binding to use as the
   facings. If you need some extra help sewing, all of the Eucalypt
   pattern tutorials will apply to this pattern as well.

   Lets run through what’s included in the pattern.

   Introducing the Mini Eucalypt woven tank and dress sewing pattern by
   Megan Nielsen!

View A is a woven tank top // View B is a woven tank with centre front seam

   This is probably the view we use the most. It’s a fabulous little
   summer top that is quick to sew and uses minimal fabric. I love using
   this to make my girls summer pjs as well as tops. one of my favourite
   hacks is to slash the pattern half way down the side seam and add a
   gathered skirt. It makes such a lovely dress!

   Megan Nielsen!

View C is a woven tank dress

   This basic tank dress is a great summer dress option, and i’ve also
   used it to make super cut nighties for my girls. The fit is roomy which
   makes it easier to slip on and off over their heads.

   Megan Nielsen!

View D is a woven tank dress with centre front seam

   For some reason i love sewing View D in a heavier fabric with feature
   stopstitching to use as a pinafore style dress. One of the great things
   about the loose fit of this pattern is that it’s incredibly easy to
   layer over long sleeves for winter which helps to stretch your little
   ones wardrobe.

   If you want to try adding something down the centre front this is a
   great option – we’ve even done tutorials on the blog for how to add
   button plackets to the adult Eucalypt and the steps are the same!

   Megan Nielsen!

   I love sewing up these tops and dresses in my leftover fabrics. The
   simple lines really allow the fabric to be the feature, and the fit is
   so roomy and comfortable that it’s always a hit with the kids.

   I really hope you love this pattern as much as i enjoy it!

   We’d love to see what you’re creating from the new Mini Eucalypt
   pattern ! Don’t forget to tag your
   creations #MNminieucalypt and @megannielsenpatterns to share what
   you’ve been working on, and check out what everyone else is up to!

Introducing the Mini Cottesloe swimsuit!

   09.10.2019 by Meg // 2 Comments

   Megan Nielsen Mini Cottesloe swimsuit! Four super adorable and
   practical kids swimsuit variations in one great pattern!

   I’m so excited to introduce you to the Mini Cottesloe swimsuit pattern!
   I started working on this pattern very shortly after I began work on
   the womens pattern. Making my own swimsuits made me extra irritated
   when I couldn’t find appropriate swimsuits for my girls. After an
   incredibly frustrating experience trying to find Bunny a bikini that
   she could swim laps in that was athletic and age appropriate, she asked
   if she could have the same one i had made myself. I love it when my
   kids ask me to make things! So I got to work and from the very first
   samples i could tell i was going to love this pattern for my girls.

   Mini Cottesloe has been thoughtfully designed with age appropriate
   details and active little lifestyles in mind. The views in this pattern
   roughly align with the adult pattern, but with adjustments to the
   design for little ones. What I love about this pattern is that not only
   does it make adorable, practical and comfy swimsuits – but you can use
   it for so many other things too! By changing your fabric choice you can
   make leotards, underwear, trainer crop tops – there are so many
   options!

   Lets have a closer look at all the views!

   Megan Nielsen Mini Cottesloe swimsuit! Four super adorable and
   practical kids swimsuit variations in one great pattern!

View A is a one piece swimsuit with back ties

   This is Birdie’s favourite view! View A includes a low back and back
   ties and is able to be fully lined if you need it to be. You can easily
   omit the ties if you would like, but for kids I would recommend keeping
   them as they are such active little souls that I think the extra
   security is necessary to stop the straps slipping off when they jumping
   around.

View B is a high back one piece

   This is your classic one piece swimsuit and you really can’t go wrong
   with it. This is a fabulous option if your child is swimming laps in or
   you just want something with clean lines that shows off your swim
   fabric. You can also use this view to make gorgeous leotards for dance
   classes, and we’ve already had some testers report doing this with
   excellent results. As with all views you can fully line this swimsuit
   and instructions are included in the pattern.

   practical kids swimsuit variations in one great pattern!

View C is a low rise bikini

   This is Bunny’s favourite view! Bunny loves wearing a bikini to swim
   because it’s so much easier for bathroom breaks. Especially when school
   swim lessons come around every year, its much easier to wear under her
   uniform until it’s lesson time. The bikini top for the mini pattern is
   longer line that the adult pattern and provides a bit more coverage to
   make it child appropriate. It’s also worth mentioning that the low rise
   here isn’t as low on the adult pattern, again to make it more kid
   friendly. This is a fantastic view for using as underwear and i’ve used
   the bottoms especially to make my girls so many pairs of comfy undies
   from my knit fabric scraps. We’ve also used the bikini top to make
   Bunny some cute trainer crop tops as she is entering that preteen stage
   of life. As with the adult pattern this view includes an optional wide
   waistband if you would like it. I highly recommend trying this view!

   practical kids swimsuit variations in one great pattern!

View D is a high waisted bikini with bands

   Much like the adult pattern this view includes a higher waistline and
   wide waistband as well as a wide underbust band. As with all views this
   one can be fully lined. Birdie is not really fan of bikinis in general
   as she doesn’t like her tummy out, so this is her preferred bikini view
   as it only really shows a small amount of abdomen. So possibly a really
   good option if you want the benefits of a bikini (easy bathroom breaks)
   without being too exposed.

   It’s also super easy to take the bikini top from View C or D and
   lengthen it to a tankini OR add a circle skirt or gathered rectangle to
   the bikini top to make a cute skater dress for summer. Honestly the
   amount of hacking potential in this pattern is beyond silly ;)

   If you need some extra help constructing your suit, you can follow the
   Cottesloe swimsuit sewalong as all the steps are exactly the same with
   the exception of the shelf bra as that isn’t necessary for this age
   group.

   If you’re wondering about how this pattern flows into the adult
   pattern, as with all my childrens patterns it’s been carefully graded
   so that once your child has grown beyond the size 12, they should be
   ready to step right into the women’s size 0.

   practical kids swimsuit variations in one great pattern!

   I love this pattern SO much and honestly wouldn’t want to put my girls
   in anything else anymore. I hope you enjoy making it up as much as I
   do! If you’re wondering about the adorable swim lycra i have used for
   these samples they are all from Ellie Whittaker studio.
