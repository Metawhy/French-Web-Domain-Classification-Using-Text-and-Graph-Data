   Food finds me at my worst. Unlike photography, my (maybe) first
   creative love, food is there for me when I’m, quite literally, gutted.

   On the days my anxiety peaks, baking keeps my body clear of my mind. A
   physical distraction with an emotional payoff (considering the baked
   good turns out, that is). I can keep my days filled with tarts,
   muffins, sweet breads and perhaps, pavlovas (failed or otherwise).  A
   (sweet) physical task is the biological cure for a busy mind.

   When depression sulks in, so does soup. The prep itself feels like a
   virtuous task, meditative in its way and duly, an act of self-care.
   Soup feels like medicine, the creation and the feat, soothing what ails
   you, whether it’s thick or brothy.

   Food finds me at my best and at my worst. When I’m feeling in love,
   impassioned, inspired, hot, cold, self-loathing, panicked, filled with
   grief, existential, anxious, sad, lethargic, tapped out from all
   things; gutted. I find even when I feel I can’t possibly cook, I do.
   Food always finds me.

SAVORY SUMMER SNACKS | siggi's

   August 25, 2017 sassy kitchen

   Between busy schedules, blood sugar drops and long-shoot days, I find
   myself subsisting on mostly nut & seeds during the busiest times.
   Instead of cramming in yet another date-sweetened bar, I’m trying to
   snack with a more vegetable-focus during these busy, Summer months.
   Some meals will still be eaten out of tupperware hunched over my
   computer, but when I make the effort, I have some ideas for *inspired*
   mini meals that require little prep and huge payoff.

   I’m sharing two recipes, both savory, vegetable-forward snacks that
   will sustain you throughout your day when pastries won’t.  I teamed up
   with siggi’s, a delicious yogurt with simple ingredients, not a lot of
   sugar and powerful snacking powers.  I’m sharing my radish-top green
   sauce, which if you follow me on instagram, you know I’ve been making
   consecutively for weeks now.  This recipe will make a batch, so use it
   as a dip, sauce on quinoa or grain bowls, and even on soft eggs as I do
   here.  For your Summer snacking & beyond...

SOFT EGGS WITH MICROGREENS, & RADISH TOP YOGURT SAUCE (SERVES 1) gluten-free

   I’m always looking for ways to use vegetable tops & scraps in a way
   that it’s actually inspiring and not a chore.  This radish-top green
   sauce is my favorite way to use radish leaves.  It’s bright & herby,
   perfectly light on summer and I use it on everything.  I even eat it
   with carrots and radishes as a dip for a quick go-to snack & since
   there’s yogurt in it, there’s enough protein and fat to hold you over.
     * 2 large eggs
     * Handful of watercress or microgreens
     * Flaky sea salt
     * Freshly ground pepper

RADISH SAUCE:

     * 1 bunch radishes stems
     * 1/4 avocado
     * 1 lemon, juice
     * 1 small bunch of parsley, stems and leaves
     * 2/3 cup siggi’s 0% plain yogurt
     * 1 garlic clove
     * 1/4-1/3 cup olive oil
     * 1/4 cup water
     * Sea salt to taste
     * Freshly ground pepper

   Make Radish Top Sacuce: Bring a kettle to boil.  Add your radish greens
   to a colander. Once water is boiling, pour over radish greens until
   they turn bright green and begin to wilt.  Then, rinse with cold water
   until cool to the touch.

   Add radish greens to blender with the remaining ingredients.  Blend
   until super smooth and set aside.

   Add at least 4 inches of water to a small saucepan and bring to a boil
   (basically enough water to cover eggs).   Once water boils, lower heat
   slightly, and slowly lower eggs into the bowl (one at a time) with a
   slotted spoon.  Let boil for 6 1/2 minutes exactly.  While it boils,
   prepare a bowl of ice water.  Once the eggs are finished, dunk them in
   the ice bath and let cool for a few minutes before shelling.

   To serve, add eggs to a small bowl with flaky sea salt and freshly
   ground pepper.  Add a handful of greens (arugula, microgreens,
   watercress,etc) and a dollop of radish to top.  Enjoy immediately.

SAVORY YOGURT BOWL WITH CUCUMBER, FRESH HERBS, TOASTED NUTS & OLIVE OIL
(SERVES 1) gluten-free

   I seriously love this idea.  I often eat yogurt with fruit and millet
   granola, but in an attempt to eat more vegetables and conquer the many
   herbs always in my fridge, this savory yogurt bowl is perfect.  You
   could even top it with a savory granola or other veggies like radishes
   or carrots.  I love this with cucumber because it’s light and feels
   perfect for warm weather months, but also has real staying power.
     * 5.3 oz. 0% siggi’s plain yogurt (or one individual yogurt
       container)
     * 1 kirby cucumber, diced
     * 2 oz. toasted pistachios, roughly chopped
     * 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (dill & parsley), finely chopped
     * Drizzle of olive oil
     * Flaky sea salt
     * Freshly ground pepper

   In a small bowl, layer yogurt with cucumber, toasted nuts and a handful
   of chopped herbs.  Drizzle with olive oil, then season with flaky sea
   salt and freshly cracked pepper. Enjoy immediately.

CHICKPEA, SWEET CORN & CHERRY TOMATO TOSTADAS WITH AVOCADO CILANTRO PESTO

   August 14, 2017 sassy kitchen

   As a native Californian (southern), I gravitate towards two things:
   mexican food & hippie vegetarian.  Although I’m technically an
   omnivore, you’d never know because I crave birdseed, salads and use
   chickpeas/peas/beans/lentils (also known as PULSES), as my main protein
   source.

   I’ve collaborated with USA Pulses & Pulse Canada for their *Half-Cup
   Campaign* in attempt to inspire us all to eat more pulses (do you need
   a reason!?).  I will add a chickpea to pretty much anything, but if you
   need inspiration for more recipes, try here or the PULSES official site
   for more ideas.

   These tacos are fresh and Californian, light enough for summer with a
   creamy/spicy sauce you’ll want to put on everything.   It's favorite
   weeknight meal to date that's quick & perfect for busy days.

CHICKPEA, SWEET CORN & CHERRY TOMATO TOSTADAS WITH AVOCADO CILANTRO SAUCE
(Serves 4) gluten-free, vegan

   Tostadas are one of my favorite weeknight meals that are quick to throw
   together in 20 minutes or less and have a huge flavor payoff.  I make
   this same recipe with whatever bean or lentil I have on hand
   (pinto/black beans are great!).  Perfect for busy nights or when all
   you have in your pantry is a can of beans and vegetable scraps on their
   last leg.
     * 2 tablespoon olive oil
     * 2 garlic cloves, minced
     * 1 spring or red onion, roughly chopped
     * 1 jalapeno, minced
     * 2 ears of corn, sliced off the cob
     * 2 cups cooked chickpeas
     * 1 lime, juiced
     * 1 teaspoon tamari
     * 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
     * 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
     * 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
     * 1 teaspoon sea salt
     * Freshly ground pepper, to taste
     * Shredded red cabbage, to top (opt.)
     * Hot sauce, to serve
     * Limes, to serve

Avocado Cilantro Pesto:

     * 1/2 avocado
     * 1 large bunch of cilantro, stems and leaves
     * 2 limes, juiced
     * 1/4 cup walnuts
     * 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
     * 2 jalapeños, roughly chopped
     * 1 teaspoon sea salt
     * 1-2 tablespoons honey, to taste
     * 2 tablespoons olive oil
     * Splash of water

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

   Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.  Add garlic,
   onion and jalapeño, stirring often until they begin to soften - about
   3-4 minutes.  Then, add corn, chickpeas, tamari, lime, spices and
   seasoning.  Stir well to combine and cook over medium heat for 5-7
   minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in cherry tomatoes.

   Add tortillas in a single layer, straight on to the baking sheet.  Bake
   for 10-12 minutes or until crisp (hard) and browned.  Set aside to
   cool.

   In the meantime, make avocado cilantro sauce:  Add all items to a
   blender and blend until smooth, adding extra water as needed to blend.

   To serve, spread avocado sauce over each tostada, layer a heaping
   spoonful of chickpea mixture, then top with red cabbage, hot sauce, and
   a squeeze of lime.  Continue with remaining tortillas. Serve
   immediately!
