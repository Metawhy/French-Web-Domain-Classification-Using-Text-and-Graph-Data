It's HERE!

   As gamers, we all demanded it: A place where we can learn about the
   videogame industry's rich history, where it's heading next, and how we
   can all be a part of it. A place where we can meet and expand our vast
   community of creative and competitive minds. A place that exudes FUN in
   a permanent home where on any given day we can play the games of
   yesterday, today AND tomorrow. It's HAPPENING in Frisco, Texas!

   Take a look at upcoming events here.
