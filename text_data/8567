How digital transformation opened new channels for growth

With help from EY professionals, Royal Caribbean’s digital-first approach is
transforming their business and the cruising experience.

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world
   works.

How can technology transform the business of adventure?

Across its family of brands, Royal Caribbean prided itself on leading-edge
innovation in ship design. It was time to bring the guest experience into the
Transformative Age.

Cruise guests want maximum fun with minimum hassle

   Time is precious, now more than ever. Almost every minute is assigned
   and accounted for in the hustle and bustle of the day.

   So when people get a chance to take a holiday from their busy lives,
   they want a frictionless experience that supersizes the vacation fun
   and minimizes the hassle factor. They want a feeling of being away
   while at the same time having all the connected comforts of home.

   For Royal Caribbean, this meant redesigning the entire customer journey
   and introducing a range of integrated technologies to bring the guest
   experience into the Transformative Age.

     We’re always thinking about tomorrow, and that requires constantly
     looking to be the disruptor, not the disruptee.

   Jason Liberty
   EVP & CFO, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Royal Caribbean saw an opportunity to provide a fully integrated
shore-to-ship digital experience

   Involving everything from zip lines to flow riding to ice skating,
   Royal Caribbean’s ship design has always been at the leading edge of
   innovation to attract a growing number of cruise passengers (from 17.8
   million per year in 2009 to an expected 27.2 million in 2018). However,
   in looking at industries such as amusement parks, casinos and airlines,
   which have been offering mobile check-in and bespoke apps to customers
   for years, Royal Caribbean realized it had an opportunity to improve
   its ability to offer guests a fully integrated shore-to-ship digital
   experience.

   The rapid pace of digital transformation has led to heightened customer
   expectations— and organizations know they need to innovate if they want
   to keep up. EY findings show that 50% of CEOs do not believe their
   companies have implemented the necessary steps to counter disruption.
   Failure to do so can put market leadership and capitalization at risk.

   The risk of being disrupted
   50%

   of CEOs do not believe their companies have implemented the necessary
   steps to counter disruption.

   To remain competitive on every level, Royal Caribbean recognized it
   needed to deliver a seamless connected experience on land and at sea
   that allowed their guests to get the most from their cruise experience.
   Understanding it needed the right partner, Royal Caribbean looked to EY
   professionals to help it cruise into the digital age.

Digital doesn’t disrupt our business but accelerates our business.

   Jay Schneider

   SVP, Digital, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.


Moving from analog to digital required a radical technological rethink

   When EY came onboard, Royal Caribbean was still in the early stages of
   its digital thinking. Guests had limited visibility to activities and
   amenities through a web portal and a minimalist app. Once aboard, they
   received a daily printed newsletter detailing the events, activities,
   restaurants and menus, shore excursions and ports of call for the day.
   Further, to participate in an event or excursion, guests had to line up
   and sign up with the crew on a first-come, first-served basis.

   This analog approach was limiting, particularly for generations who
   were more accustomed to a digital-first mindset and were looking for a
   more streamlined and frictionless experience.

   “People today expect the ease of technology in everything they do,”
   says Richard Fain, Chairman and CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.
   “They find it saves them time and effort, especially when on vacation,
   where time is one of the most important commodities they have.”

This was an opportunity for Royal Caribbean to think differently about
connecting with their guests, with their employees and also with new revenue
streams.

   Raj Mirchandani

   EY Advisory Account Leader for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.


   “This was an opportunity for Royal Caribbean to think differently about
   connecting with their guests, with their employees and also with new
   revenue streams,” Raj Mirchandani, EY Advisory Account Leader for Royal
   Caribbean Cruises Ltd., explains. “Done right, this could lead to new
   ways of operating that provide not just what today’s digitally savvy
   customers expect, but something that fundamentally changes their
   perception of what it means to go on a cruise.”

   Of course, developing a digital experience that worked on ship and
   shore, across a fleet of 40 ships, was no easy task. The EY team needed
   to think about digital from every angle throughout the company’s entire
   business.

   works.

Providing experiences on-demand that are available with a click and a swipe

Out front and behind the scenes, the EY team is helping Royal Caribbean give
guests control over every aspect of their voyage.

Facial recognition that speeds up boarding is just one feature of a new
seamless customer experience

   “Often, EY clients will come to us, and they’ll say, ‘We want to
   rethink the customer experience in a new digital way,’” says Cheryl
   Grise, EY Advisory Lead, Southeast Region. “And as you start to probe
   and ask more questions, you realize they’re saying a lot more than
   that. What we learned is that Royal Caribbean wasn’t just asking for
   the customer experience to be digitized; they were also asking how to
   become a fully equipped digital organization.”

   From having guests check in using facial recognition to facilitate
   faster boarding; to informing them via text that their luggage had
   safely arrived in their stateroom; to exploring, planning and booking
   activities through an app that puts every onboard adventure for every
   age at guests’ fingertips, the EY team is helping Royal Caribbean
   create a seamless customer experience.

The guest experience gets a digital facelift

   EY and Royal Caribbean professionals used data and analytics to create
   a personalization engine that gives guests mobile control over many
   different touchpoints in their cruising experience. Through the
   personalization engine, the app learns, tracks and helps crews respond
   to passenger preferences from the moment of boarding, providing
   recommendations based on their behavior so that guests can enjoy the
   adventure on their own terms.

   Behind the scenes, teams of EY and Royal Caribbean technology, digital
   and business professionals worked together to solve the challenges
   associated with creating an uninterrupted digital experience, whether
   it was onshore through fiber optics, or through satellites while at
   sea.

Innovative digital technology works to detangle layers of backend legacy IT
systems

   As part of an evolutionary rebuild, EY professionals initially focused
   on reconfiguring Royal Caribbean’s IT systems so that they could
   recognize each guest as an individual, authenticate and offer
   intelligent personalization, and customize every aspect of their
   itinerary. The teams used mobile, cloud, machine learning, and data
   analytics technologies to detangle a complex, layered legacy technology
   infrastructure. The result — a rebuilt IT platform that is modern,
   scalable and resilient.

Intelligent personalization and integrated automation provide a more
profitable cruising experience

   What this means in real terms is that once a guest has downloaded the
   app, snapped a selfie and turned on their Bluetooth, the new app uses
   integrated automation and intelligent personalization to let them
   explore activities they’d be likely to enjoy. The app also allows
   guests to do things like pull up a drink menu and input an order, which
   a cruise employee later delivers directly to them with the help of
   beacon technology. In addition, based on information guests input into
   the app, it can automatically alert servers to any food sensitivities
   and allergies so that guests won’t have to worry about their health and
   safety while onboard.

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world

The whole journey–transformed

Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation helps families have the best
vacation time of their lives.

Beyond technology, Royal Caribbean reimagines its operating model to deliver
experiences on-demand.

   For Royal Caribbean, digital transformation means more than developing
   an app or deploying digital technology. It’s about changing the entire
   operating model and creating a digital mindset across the organization
   that focuses on providing a frictionless experience in every
   interaction for every guest.

   The EY team positioned Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey
   to begin by looking first at the guest and employee experiences,
   developing a digital vision for the enterprise and making incremental
   changes to each. This will evolve to cover the whole end-to-end
   cruising experience — from booking to boarding to cruising. Meanwhile,
   the EY and Royal Caribbean teams are considering the employee
   experience and how Royal Caribbean can give them greater levels of
   engagement with purpose, as well as the digitally connected advantages
   cruise guests now enjoy.

If I do my job right, you won’t even notice the technology. You’ll just
notice really amazing experiences.

   Joey Hasty

   Innovation and Transformation Lead, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.


EY helps Royal Caribbean take a digital transformation journey that allows
guests to enjoy their adventure, their way

   When holiday-seekers set about booking a vacation, they are often
   overworked, overloaded and overtired. Their vacation is a chance to
   leave that burden behind — as much as they can.

   With the EY team’s help, Royal Caribbean was able to realize its
   objective of offering guests a fully integrated shore-to-ship digital
   experience. A redesigned terminal experience supports facial
   recognition for faster boarding so that guests can start vacationing
   earlier. Integrated automation and intelligent personalization improve
   guest satisfaction, increase onboard revenue and lower costs.

   Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey is a win-win for
   cruise guests and the company’s bottom line. Seamless, personalized
   experiences allow guests to enjoy their adventure, their way, while new
   in-app revenue opportunities lead the way for more profitable growth.

   a cruise employee later delivers directly to them with the help of
   beacon technology. In addition, based on information guests input into
   the app, it can automatically alert servers to any food sensitivities
   and allergies so that guests won’t have to worry about their health and
   safety while onboard.

The whole journey–transformed

Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation helps families have the best
vacation time of their lives.

Beyond technology, Royal Caribbean reimagines its operating model to deliver
experiences on-demand.

   For Royal Caribbean, digital transformation means more than developing
   an app or deploying digital technology. It’s about changing the entire
   operating model and creating a digital mindset across the organization
   that focuses on providing a frictionless experience in every
   interaction for every guest.

   The EY team positioned Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey
   to begin by looking first at the guest and employee experiences,
   developing a digital vision for the enterprise and making incremental
   changes to each. This will evolve to cover the whole end-to-end
   cruising experience — from booking to boarding to cruising. Meanwhile,
   the EY and Royal Caribbean teams are considering the employee
   experience and how Royal Caribbean can give them greater levels of
   engagement with purpose, as well as the digitally connected advantages
   cruise guests now enjoy.

If I do my job right, you won’t even notice the technology. You’ll just
notice really amazing experiences.

EY helps Royal Caribbean take a digital transformation journey that allows
guests to enjoy their adventure, their way

   When holiday-seekers set about booking a vacation, they are often
   overworked, overloaded and overtired. Their vacation is a chance to
   leave that burden behind — as much as they can.

   With the EY team’s help, Royal Caribbean was able to realize its
   objective of offering guests a fully integrated shore-to-ship digital
   experience. A redesigned terminal experience supports facial
   recognition for faster boarding so that guests can start vacationing
   earlier. Integrated automation and intelligent personalization improve
   guest satisfaction, increase onboard revenue and lower costs.

   Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey is a win-win for
   cruise guests and the company’s bottom line. Seamless, personalized
   experiences allow guests to enjoy their adventure, their way, while new
   in-app revenue opportunities lead the way for more profitable growth.

How to use IoT and data to transform the economics of a sport

Cycling has a monetization problem. Velon, with the help of EY teams, is
changing this through realtime data and the Internet of Things (IoT).

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world
   works.

How can you turn spectators into fans?

Cycling has a money problem; but with a huge fanbase to draw from, can the
sport create a platform that can effectively engage and monetize global
viewership?

   On the face of it, cycling should be easy to monetize. With more than a
   billion bicycles in the world, it’s an activity as ubiquitous as
   watching TV or going on the internet – a fundamental part of modern
   living.

   Yet, despite growing media attention and an expanding fanbase, the
   sport of cycling has been stubbornly resistant to effective
   monetization. Velon, a consortium dedicated to resolving this issue,
   came to EY teams for help.

   Velon brings together 11 teams that compete in professional cycling
   around the world. They came together to answer one critical question:
   how do we improve the economics of the sport?

     Pretty much everybody we explained the idea to said, "Forget it.
     You're crazy.

   Graham Bartlett
   CEO, Velon

   “I’ve worked in sports for 20 years, and pro road cycling has by far
   the most dysfunctional economic model,” says Graham Bartlett, CEO,
   Velon. “It really doesn’t work. The reaction to that was to form and
   create Velon.”

   Why has professional cycling been so dysfunctional? Global commercial
   cycling revenues are only $600 million – compared to $8.2 billion in
   the NFL, and $16.8 billion between just the five biggest European
   soccer leagues.

   The difference is these sports benefit from being able to host large,
   ticketed events in one place. Cycling, where races cover thousands of
   miles of open road, does not have this luxury. Without equivalent
   infrastructure, cycling struggles to achieve the commercial heights of
   other sports

   Ironically, with pro cycling it's the most dedicated fans – those
   waiting by the roadside – that can miss out the most. More casual
   viewers, watching on TV or listening on the radio, can get a more
   holistic coverage of the race: fans by the roadside can only catch a
   glimpse of the cyclists as they go past.

   But cycling does have its own assets: professional cyclists generate
   huge amounts of data, from heart rate, to bike speed to information
   about the terrain on which they are riding. Properly captured, this
   data presents a huge opportunity for cycling superfans to develop
   closer, and more intimate engagements with the sport and their
   favourite teams and riders.

   Velon has close access to these opportunities – the teams they
   represent generate terabytes of raw data every year. Velon’s goal was
   to capture, transform, and deliver this data to a global cycling
   audience of 565 million people.

   “We came up with this fascinating problem, which is how do you transmit
   thousands of data points per second out of a live sporting event while
   it moves from Bologna to Rome, all across the Alps and everywhere
   else,” remembers Bartlett. “Pretty much everybody we explained it to
   except the guys at EY said, ‘Forget it. You're crazy. You can do that
   at a stadium – and even then it's difficult – but to do it in a bike
   race that moves 200 miles down the road every day? No chance.’ EY teams
   looked at it and said, "This is a fantastic IoT challenge.’"

   And if this crazy challenge could be overcome, EY and Velon would have
   the opportunity to give fans worldwide a first-class platform through
   which to directly engage with cycling – and create the foundations for
   a truly effective commercial cycling economy.

   works.

Converting spectators into fans through data

By using IoT solutions to leverage the data generated by professional
cyclists, EY and Velon were able to build an app that brought cycling
straight to the fans.

   EY and Velon’s approach was to create an IoT solution that could
   collect the vast amounts of potential data from cyclists in races
   around the world, and turn it into interactive, revealing data
   highlights and stories, putting viewers at the heart of the race, and
   giving them deep insights into their favorite cyclists and teams
   through a dedicated app. The digital experience could then become a new
   one-stop-shop for cycling fans everywhere, building and growing a large
   audience of cycling fans and potential consumers, and forming the
   foundation for a more sustainable cycling economic model.

   “In 2015 this was a theory. It was an idea. Nobody had brought it
   alive. Some people had sort of dipped their toe in this water a few
   years before, on a very small scale, but what we wanted to do was do it
   on a massive scale,” explains Bartlett. “We wanted to show every rider
   and let people see them in ways that no one had ever done in any sport
   before, never mind road cycling.”

   Bringing together multiple teams from around the world, including the
   US, Australia, India, Denmark, and the UK, EY teams worked with Velon
   to create a platform that could achieve these aims. The solution had
   three parts:

1.  A robust IoT system to capture and transmit the required data

   The first step was to find an IoT device that could collect the
   necessary data from the cyclists. This is a small device that is placed
   under the saddle of bikes in the professional peloton. The device
   captures critical information about the cyclists as they aparticipate
   in races – all of which is  bothuseful for the teams in tracking
   performance, and fascinating for fans to follow the progress of the
   race. The information it provides includes:
     * Power
     * Cadence (the speed at which the cyclist peddled)
     * GPS information (location, bike speed, and direction of travel)
     * Heart rate information

   Velon device montage

   While it may be relatively easy to capture this data from a stationary
   exercise bike in a gym, out in the field for a sport in which races
   cover dozens of miles a day – often through remote countryside with
   limited connectivity – the logistics were staggering.

   To make matters worse, the devices also need to be removed and charged
   overnight. As races often continue for several days – and bike parts
   are changed regularly during that time – special care needs to be taken
   to ensure that each cyclist is paired with the correct device each
   morning to build up the correct aggregate race data. With data becoming
   ever more fundamental to the sport, one error in refitting a device
   could create significant problems for the teams, organizers,
   broadcasters, and Velon alike – and potentially lose the trust of the
   fans.

   “It’s been an incredibly complicated technical challenge to get that
   information, and then do something sensible with it, that we can drive
   insight from, visualize, and show to consumers in a meaningful way,”
   says Michael Henry, Director, EY Analytics. “We’re taking vast amounts
   of information across bikes that move up to 100kmph, and they’re
   travelling across thousands of miles for eight hours at a time. So
   we’ve got some incredible technical challenges when doing that, over
   mountains and incredibly isolated terrain, for long periods. We had
   challenges with water-proofing, battery life, and also the precision
   and accuracy of the bikes and where they are.”

2.  A trusted, secure central data aggregation platform

   After gathering the data on the bikes, it needs to be relayed to a
   central aggregation platform, which aggregates rider data and combines
   it with external information sources (such as team names, stats and
   route maps) to enable deeper analysis and insight.

   Even seemingly simple information like calculating rider speed can
   prove surprisingly complex out on the road, with patchy data signals
   and GPS coverage – to calculate speed required combining on-bike
   cadence and power data with GPS data, as no one information source
   would be sufficient alone.

   To compound the challenge further – some of the data being collected
   needed to be kept proprietary to the individual racing teams. After
   all, these teams are in competition, and use data to benchmark, analyze
   and improve their performances – all in a sport that generates prize
   money and sponsorship opportunities for the winners. While some of the
   aggregated data is made public, there also needs to be clear firewalls
   between sensitive information that could give competitors unfair
   insights into each other’s’ performance and tactics.

   “We are the guardian in the middle, owned and trusted by those teams,
   and they put their faith in us,” explains Bartlett. “That's why working
   with a collaborator like EY teams is essential, because you have to
   have a degree of certainty and trust that the right firewalls and the
   right positions are there, and make sure that nobody could get into
   that data. That's what we have with EY teams.”

   The solution was the EY data platform, which provides a broad
   capability for high speed streaming ingestion, storage, cognitive
   analytics and artificial intelligence. Within the Velon project, this
   provided the backbone for building the aggregation and analytics
   functions of the app.

3.  A platform for communicating those data and insights to the wider viewing
public

   The final part of the process, and of the experience, was to create a
   consumer facing platform that transformed this data into an engaging
   user experience. As Barlett puts it, “If you put onboard live cameras
   on one bike in one race, it's not interesting. If you put them on 11
   bikes, 11 teams, all of a sudden you've got an actual broadcast feed
   people will pay for. So Velon, by covering a bigger grouping and being
   a true collective, is able to do things that any individual team on its
   own can't do economically.”

   Ultimately, the user-facing app aims to give cycling fans the same kind
   of all-in-one experience fans of other sports would experience in a
   stadium: a constant overview of the state of play, running commentary
   and statistics, and a sense of community and participation in the event
   itself. As Robin Hutchinson, EY Global Digital Products and Solutions
   Leader, explains, “the app means they can watch the broadcast sitting
   on the side of the road, uploading pictures, consuming the data, and
   really getting a great experience. It changes what cycling looks like
   to the fan.”

   This third element will continue to evolve, Bartlett says: “Right now,
   we know that the fan experience that Velon is giving to people is not
   what we want it to be. We can see the future of this is in making it
   simple, contextual, engaging, and relevant – that is absolutely what
   this new deal with EY teams are all about. This is why we’re involving
   other people within the Global EY network to help us to realise that –
   because ultimately fan engagement is what this is all about.”

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world
   works.

Integrating the fan into the sport for a richer experience

Creating a one-stop-shop for global cycling fans, laying the foundations for
an effective cycling business model.

   The platform has seen considerable success. Over more than two years of
   gradual rollout and development, nearly a million people have
   participated in some part of the Velon app ecosystem, and millions more
   have consumed the data via TV broadcasts.

   “What we’re basically providing is a second-screen experience. You’re
   inside the race, you get to see things that the motorcycles and the
   cameras don’t capture, you get to see things helicopters don’t capture,
   and that’s all broadcast to you in a way that gives you more fidelity
   for what’s happening in that race,” says Hutchinson.

   Curating this successful fan engagement, and creating a centralized
   platform for cycling, can then help Velon answer underlying questions
   about cycling’s economic viability.

   The platform offers Velon several routes for monetization. Sponsor and
   advertiser revenue is a clear and obvious route. A freemium model of
   the app is also being built, giving fans access to enhanced services
   and additional features, such as the ability to compare their own
   performance to that of professional racers. A third avenue is to
   leverage customer data provided via the app to support commercial
   relationships with alternative and third-party models.

   But at its heart, EY teams and Velon’s platform proves that, with the
   right data and experience, it’s possible to create a whole new way of
   talking with fans, radically transforming how they engage with their
   sport and promoting cycling more generally. This in turn promotes
   healthier lifestyles, more sustainable transport, and creates a more
   profitable, more innovative, talent-hungry cycling business sector.

   “Without EY teams we wouldn’t have been able to realize this vision.”
   says Velon CEO Graham Bartlett “The NBA aren’t doing it yet, the NFL
   aren’t doing it, nobody’s doing it. But we’re doing it. We’re already
   doing it. We’ve been doing it for over a year now. And we’ve been able
   to do that because of the collaboration with EY. Without them helping
   us build that vision, we wouldn’t be in the place that we are now.”

   Velon’s app also points the way forward for more data-enabled sport in
   general. “What is clear is that the way fans interact with sport is
   changing,” says Tom Kingsley, EY Sport Industry Group Leader in the UK.
   “Whether in a stadium, by the side of a road, or watching at home, fans
   want a much more immersive experience. What we’re developing for Velon
   will significantly improve the way cycling fans can engage with their
   sport. That has to be a good thing for fans, for teams and for the
   sport as a whole”
