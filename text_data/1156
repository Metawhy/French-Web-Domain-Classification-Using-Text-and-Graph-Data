Everywhere Travel

   If I could travel anywhere, where would I go? Everywhere!

Travel-velocity slow to stop

   Travel is tough when the view looks like this. For me actually it isn't
   the rain that keeps me home but the city view. I love my San Francisco
   view plain and simple. It makes it difficult for me to leave. Crazy?
   Maybe.
   I certainly have friends who can't wait to get away to somewhere warm
   and dry by the time February and March arrive. They either live in the
   snow and are tired of shoveling the white stuff and driving through it,
   or they live in the northern wet and muddy regions. However for me, I
   can't complain because for the most part our weather in San Francisco
   is mild compared to places like Seattle or Boston.
   So, I think I will sit here and enjoy this passing storm, not complain
   when I have to put on a rain slicker to take the dog out for a walk,
   and contemplate my return to Japan. I am due for an Asia adventure and
   it has been quite a few years since a flight took me in that direction.
   So far three good reasons: Japanese friends are having babies, I'm
   interested in experiencing Vietnam, and I would like to go back to Bali
   again.

Do these Creative People travel?

   These detailed sculptures made from household items are hilarious. The
   way they were photographed helps too.  Now my question is: does travel
   spark creativity like this or are they already creative and naturally
   came up with these great images?

Lions and Tigers Oh My!

   Falling back in love with San Francisco, I have been exploring my city
   by foot and by neighborhood.  Recently I went to the re-opened and
   completely renovated California Academy of Sciences.
   This science hall could be an entire day if you want or a healthy four
   hours.  They have exhibits like this one, with incredible life-like
   lions and tigers.  If you stay longer, I suggest adding a visit to the
   Planetarium to rest your feet while you enjoy the view.

Oxbow Public Market in Napa helps fill the void

   Day trips from San Francisco. Why leave this great city and head north?
   On a sunny day it would be a tough call but unless you left really
   early and plan to stay in Tahoe to ski, my favorite incentive to head
   north across the Golden Gate Bridge would have to be to check out
   Napa.  Downtown Napa around the waterfront has been getting a much
   needed face-lift since COPIA closed.
   COPIA was wonderful and I will miss Julia's Kitchen as well as the good
   intentions of this wine, food and arts center.  However what is a great
   surprise and treat is my discovery of the Oxbow Public Market across
   the parking lot.

                         Fresh Oysters at Hog Island

   This marketplace reminded me a little of the San Francisco Ferry
   Building Marketplace.  The vendors are all local and focused closely on
   good quality products. They compliment each other and include: Ritual
   Coffee Roaster, Fatted Calf, C Casa Taqueria, Three Twins Ice Cream,
   Five Dot Ranch, Hog Island Oyster Co. to name just some of the great
   food choices.

                          Best Oysters Rockefeller!

   Besides the fresh oysters, we also had a homemade hot dog that was
   amazing at Five Dot Ranch.  They asked our feedback and I was happy to
   describe how the flavor was perfection and we'd be back for sure.  What
   was delicious but I could have eaten more was the duck taco from C Casa
   Taqueria.  I think next time I will get a whole or half duck to take
   home too. They looks divine on the rotisserie!
   We definitely plan to return for more and maybe get in a little kayak
   down the Napa River when the temperatures warm up.

Uniquely Japanese New Year

                                [2062.jpg]
                      Photo courtesy of Mainichi Daily

   These are "shimekazari" -- traditional New Year's decorations made with
   sacred Shinto rope of rice straw and other ornaments -- in the shape of
   samurai topknots.
   When we lived in Japan you could find versions of these mounted on the
   sides of buildings and on someone's front door. I will never forget
   seeing the side of the Meiji-ya Grocery Store building in Hiroo.  Hiroo
   is a neighborhood filled with embassies and western families.  The
   Meiji-ya had both western Christmas decorations mixed in with the
   Japanese.
   I love how uniquely Japanese these New Year's decorations are in their
   symbols.  Each section is specific in how it relates to the new year,
   prosperity, good health et al.
   What is a little sad is that the skill and knowledge on how to make
   something like this, is fading within the country.

   Giving Fearlessly: Cleo and the Song of the Sea
   We love taking our dog to the beach. On the edge of town, where the
   hang gliders soar off of wind swept cliffs, is a wonderful stretch of
   beach that allows off-leash play for dogs. Our big German
   Shepherd-Siberian Husky girl loves chasing shore birds and having loads
   of space to stretch her legs while running across the cool wet sand.
   One afternoon, during a rare heat wave, the three of us were enjoying
   the quiet empty beach. The temperature was mild, which is rare because
   the cold Pacific Ocean temperatures ensure the need for even a light
   windbreaker on the sunniest of days. We walked for an hour in almost
   humid conditions. The warm mist and low tide encouraged my imagination
   to create a stranded pirate ship just past the breakers.
   [ManCompanionDog.jpg]
   We didn't see anyone, only a few sand dollars and few birds but I did
   capture some unusual photos.  This photograph above highlights the
   special solitude of our beach walk that day and it is a beautiful
   reminder of the unique relationship between man and dog.
   I've read that dogs make us human, and this photo of quiet
   companionship seems to support that theory. My husband didn't realize
   that I had captured this wonderful moment. He was enjoying the walk
   with our dog too much to pay that much attention to what images I was
   snapping my lens at. When we got home and I saw this amazing moment
   captured, I knew it would have to become a gift.
   A few months later, after I turned this photo into a canvas, it was
   wrapped and under our Christmas tree.  To my husband's surprise and
   delight, it became one of the best gifts I've ever given him.  He has
   it hanging today near his desk as a reminder of how fortunate we are to
   live where we do and to have found such a wonderful rescue dog at the
   SPCA.

Another side to San Francisco

                               [DSC01743.JPG]
        Recycling that is often condemned but rarely seen in daylight

   Here is one side of the green movement in San Francisco that you don't
   see very often, at least not in daylight.  Residential neighborhoods
   regularly get men and women walking the streets and plucking cans and
   bottles from public and private trash cans.  They carry their bags this
   way or if part of a larger crew, they will covertly meet up with a
   truck parked or idling further down the street.
