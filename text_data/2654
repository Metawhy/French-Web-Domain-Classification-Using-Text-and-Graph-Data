   botanical art

   Less smudgy and easier to control than charcoal, richer and darker than
   graphite ‚Äî and with no graphite ‚Äúshine‚Äù ‚Ä¶ carbon pencil is a sensitive
   and satisfying medium for botanical drawing. In a series of 12
   step-by-step video lessons, learn new techniques while drawing a wide
   range of flowers and their pollinators. Each video is accompanied by
   illustrated printable pages and a selection of licensed reference
   images.

   KEEP YOUR COURSE ACCESS FOREVER. There is no expiration date for your
   video access; the password-protected site is yours permanently.
   Beginning October 1, a new lesson will post weekly for 12 weeks. Work
   at your own pace. Unlimited instructor feedback is available anytime
   you like, via email. You do not have to complete a lesson each week ‚Äî
   your site password will never expire.

   NEW! BEGINNERS WELCOME ‚Äì THIS IS A ‚ÄúFREEHAND OPTIONAL‚Äù COURSE. Please
   don‚Äôt let a lack of drawing experience keep you from the course. Every
   lesson begins with a demo of how to draw a preliminary sketch in 2B
   pencil before we begin to layer the carbon pencils‚Ä¶ BUT if you prefer
   to concentrate on carbon pencil blending and shading now, and save the
   freehand sketching practice for later, I will also provide printable
   preliminary sketches you can transfer and use to get started. Happy to
   help!

   Dear Friends,

   I have some news ‚Äì originally, our year-long course was set to end on
   June 29, with a bonus lesson to finish out the cycle on July 7.

   However‚Ä¶ in response to a steady stream of email requests, I am
   extending the lessons for two months, through the end of August. (We
   have lots of teachers among us, and summer is their creative time!)

   Here is our itinerary for the remaining lessons:

   6-1 Beautiful Lookalikes: monarch, viceroy, queen and king butterflies
   (watercolor sketching)
   6-8 Monarch life cycle and host plant in colored pencil (botanical
   drawing)
   6-15 Trompe l‚Äôoeil Butterfly Collection in colored pencil (realism)
   6-22 Summer wildflowers with a splash (loose watercolor)
   6- 29 Summer wildflower color wheel in colored pencil (botanical
   drawing)

   The month of July will focus on birds of prey ‚Äî from the tiny shrike to
   the world‚Äôs largest raptor, the harpy eagle. Four lessons will feature
   a different bird and a different technique each week.

   Our final month, August, will focus on colored pencil and will be all
   about animals and their settings. Deer, fox, aquatic animals and even
   the domestic cat will each have a week this month‚Ä¶ with our final
   lesson going out August 31.

   The archives will be open to you permanently, starting on June 30. The
   July and August lessons will be added to the archives when we conclude.

   Thank you from the bottom of my heart, for joining me in this year of
   drawing and painting nature. üôÇ

   tape

   The tape is drawn‚Ä¶ to secure a sheet of paper that is drawn‚Ä¶ which
   contains a drawn butterfly who uses the illusion of owl eyes to
   frighten away predators. I love the medium of carbon pencil, with its
   slightly mysterious feel and lush, bottomless black values. I‚Äôm working
   on a collection of drawings now that will combine wild and tame aspects
   in a symbolic or narrative way.

Free pen-and-ink video lesson: Draw a baby robin

   07 Sunday Apr 2019

   Contrary to centuries of popular folklore, the robin is not a reliable
   sign of spring in most of the world. Hardy and unconcerned with the
   cold, robins have been known to remain straight through New England
   winters and to leave breeding grounds on the Arctic tundra not because
   the temperatures dropped, but only when food supplies grew scarce.

   The red-winged blackbird, whose migration is as regular as clockwork,
   should be our harbinger of spring. But somehow, the robin manages to
   hold on to his title year after winter-weary year.

   In this video lesson, we will use the wonderful textural qualities of
   pen and ink to draw fledgling robins, just at the brink of flight. Baby
   birds are fun to draw, because they are so angular and awkward. And all
   baby birds ‚Äî robins and otherwise ‚Äî are wonderful indicators that
   spring is well and truly here.

   Watch the video all the way through and print the illustrated pdf pages
   before you begin. Happy drawing!

   robinblog

   This week‚Äôs Journey video lesson is a fun technique ‚Äî pencil textures
   over a watercolor base ‚Äî and our subject is the robin. Lots of folks
   associate this fellow with the first return of Spring, but actually the
   robin is quite cold-tolerant and often he opts to stay put, instead of
   flying south for the winter. A better harbinger of warmer days would be
   the noisy and numerous red-winged blackbird.

   hare

   Easter is only a few weeks away, so here is a video tutorial (and a set
   of printable pdf pages) to guide you in creating a spring hare in
   watercolor and pencil. I used 140 lb. Strathmore watercolor paper and a
   #4 synthetic round brush in the demo, but feel free to substitute if
   you have different supplies.

   This video first appeared in my Draw Paint Letter yearlong course. I
   hope you enjoy it.

   Carbon pencil drawing in progress

   I was baffled, the first time an art teacher handed me a piece of
   charcoal. A quiet child who compulsively inked animals on inappropriate
   surfaces (inside textbooks, on school desks, on walls, on the arms of
   giggling classmates), I had been enrolled in a Saturday class in hopes
   that it would channel the drawing urge.

   Our subject was an uninspiring bowl of oranges ‚Äî in retrospect,
   probably not a wise choice for a classroom full of energetic
   nine-year-olds. My brittle black stick of vine charcoal snapped in half
   and peppered the paper with a galaxy of specks and smudges. After a few
   minutes, I abandoned the still life assignment and sketched a herd of
   prehistoric horses I had seen in a book on cave paintings. Dark smudged
   heads and bodies fading to pale bellies, slender galloping legs. The
   teacher did not approve.

   I did not return on the following Saturday, and for the next 51 years I
   had little interest in drawing with charcoal‚Ä¶ until I met the carbon
   pencil a few weeks ago, and immediately fell in love.

   A blend of lamp black and clay, the carbon pencil is harder than
   traditional charcoal. It produces a deliciously deep, flat black with
   none of the annoying shine that graphite can leave on the paper. The
   carbon pencil has a lot to teach me about drawing‚Ä¶ and none of it
   involves a bowl of oranges.

Mama‚Äôs Last Picnic

   11 Monday Mar 2019

   Posted by valwebb in Uncategorized

   My mom, a prolific writer, submitted this remembrance to NPR a few
   years back. When they called to arrange legal permission for its
   broadcast, they were so charmed by her soft southern accent that they
   asked her to read it aloud on the air.  She would be 83 today. She
   would be delighted that you are reading her work, and I am too. Enjoy.
   ScanMamaSized

   The author (center) with her parents, Helen and Claud Thomason


   By Margaret-Ann Allison

   The pungent aroma of baked ham curled out the kitchen window and
   wrapped around my head. I had spent the entire morning perched on a
   limb of the mango tree in our Fort Lauderdale back yard, reading a
   Nancy Drew mystery. Now the whirring of a mixer and clanking pots and
   pans briefly took my mind off the mosquito droning in my ear. The day
   of the big picnic had finally arrived.

   All summer I had looked forward to the picnic my parents had planned
   with my aunt and uncle. I had such fun with my cousins when we visited
   at their farm, but this time they would be in my territory ‚Äî the beach.

   Mama was a good cook and she loved preparing fancy menus for special
   occasions. In fact, the only thing she liked better was criticizing
   someone else. She was especially discriminating where in-laws were
   concerned. More than once it had been called to her attention that her
   sister-in-law (a well respected caterer) cooked ‚Äúthe best cakes this
   side of heaven.‚Äù Mama said, ‚ÄúHer cakes are too heavy and her icings
   taste of lard.‚Äù She shared her opinion with the Tuesday Church Circle
   group and knew it would reach the ears  for which she she had intended
   it.

   ‚ÄúMama, I‚Äôm starving!‚Äù I called as I slid to the ground and headed
   toward the screened door of the back porch.

   ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre hungry that means you‚Äôll be ready to enjoy your meal when we
   get to the picnic.‚Äù Mama had been cooking for two days, and her time
   and temper were getting short.

   ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come in on my clean floors with your sandy feet and dirty
   clothes. Go wash off at the spigot and get ready to go. The chicken is
   almost done and soon as I ice the cake, we‚Äôll leave.‚Äù

   Daddy watched in silence as Mama stuffed egg halves with a creamy
   yellow mixture she extruded from a pastry bag and twirled into stars.

   ‚ÄúIs the cooler full of ice and did you pack the cloth I put out? I
   won‚Äôt eat my dinner off those dirty wooden tables ‚Äî be sure the lid is
   clamped tight on the tea pitcher or we will have tea sloshed all over
   the trunk when we get there. Will someone please answer that phone? I
   can‚Äôt do everything,‚Äù she said, as she covered the deviled eggs with
   wax wrap and began icing a large layer cake with coconut-and-seafoam
   icing.

   As I passed the hallway I heard Daddy talking on the phone. ‚ÄúWell,
   we‚Äôre running a little late but we should be leaving in about twenty
   minutes. You go ahead and put your things on a table but save us one
   nearby. See you soon.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI was afraid of this,‚Äù came the wail from the kitchen. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll arrive
   and your sister-in-law will have her gourmet feast spread out and
   she‚Äôll stand there sneering at my offering. I should have baked some
   beans to go with the potato salad. I just know she‚Äôll bring one of
   those seven-spice pound cakes she is so proud of.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt matter what you bring if you don‚Äôt hurry,‚Äù Daddy sighed. ‚ÄúIt
   will be too dark for anyone to see it.‚Äù

   Finally the car was loaded, the gear stowed in the trunk, and as we
   backed out the drive, Mama said, ‚ÄúI feel like I did during exams when
   we were in college.‚Äù

   The twenty-minute drive was made in total silence. I was joyously
   anticipating making sandcastles and forts with my four male cousins.
   Daddy must have been counting the number of trips he would have to make
   with the baskets of food, cooler chests, towels and chairs before he
   could finally sit and visit with his brother. I‚Äôm certain that Mama was
   mentally checking the long-thought-out menu she had worked on so hard.
   This was one time her in-laws would not outshine her! The ham (baked in
   a mixture of orange juice and honey) was perfect. The fried chicken had
   just the right shade of gold on the batter. Her deviled eggs and potato
   salad looked exactly like the picture in the magazine she had copied
   the recipe from, but the crowning touch would be her homemade coconut
   cake. She had cracked and ground the coconut meat herself to assure a
   fluffy freshness.

   As our car pulled into the parking area, Mama‚Äôs worst fear was
   realized. My aunt was standing beside a table which was obscured from
   view by the crowd of relatives around it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll carry the cake,‚Äù Mama
   said, opening the car door for me, ‚Äúand you take the tea pitcher. Your
   father can bring the big hamper.‚Äù

   Mama held the cake in front of her as a warrior would his shield, and
   walked through the sand toward the tables. As the crowd parted, she
   looked confused ‚Äî and then triumphant. There, sitting atop newspapers,
   was a large jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bag of chips,  a
   jar of grape jelly, a sack of apples, a carton of Pepsi and a pitcher
   of tea.

   Eyeing the coconut cake, my aunt said, ‚ÄúI hope you didn‚Äôt go to a lot
   of trouble. I‚Äôve been so busy with my catering I haven‚Äôt had time to
   cook for my family.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI know exactly what you mean,‚Äù smiled Mama sweetly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been busy
   too, so I just threw together a few things I had in the refrigerator.‚Äù

   Mama never went on another picnic. ‚ÄúYou just can‚Äôt improve on perfect,‚Äù
   she said.
