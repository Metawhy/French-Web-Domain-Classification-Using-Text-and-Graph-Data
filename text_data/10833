   Hey Guys! Happy Monday!!
   Summer Crostini 6 Ways | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest

   I’m going to get right down to the point today because we have SIX
   cheesy crostini recipes to chat about, so there is ZERO time to waste.
   I mean, we need to talk all things burrata, blue cheese, goat cheese,
   cheddar, brie and feta.

   Basically all the cheeses…obviously.

   The 4th of July is just one week from today and the new Tieghan is all
   about party appetizers. They’ve quickly become some of my favorite
   recipes to create…hello cheese boards, crostini, dips, sliders and
   foods on sticks. So fun, so cute and SO GOOD!

   I have been wanting to create a post like this for a while. I love the
   concept of sharing ideas like this, where you can pick and choose your
   favorite combos or even make them all. Plus, a lot of times I can have
   so many flavor combos that I am dying to tell you all about. Choosing
   just one is the hardest thing for me, like the hardest. So I finally
   just gave in and decided, screw it, let’s do crostini 6 ways.

   You can make them all or make just one or two, either way I feel like
   everyone should be able to enjoy something from this post.

   ALSO, how fun would it be have a little 4th of July crostini party with
   all these? Everyone could try each combo and pick their favorites.
   Plus, did anyone notice the reds, whites and blues?!? Okok, so maybe
   they’re not that obvious, but there is red, white and blue happening
   here, which makes these pretty festive for the fourth… just saying,

   Alright, so let’s talk shop already. Here’s the run down of each
   crostini you see in these photos. Instead of providing you guys with
   full recipes, measurements and all that stuff, I thought it would be
   better to just list what I put on each piece of bread in order of the
   way I assembled them. When I make crostini or things on toast, I never
   measure out anything closely, it’s just a little of this and a little
   of that, you know? Feel free to take these ideas and use them as a base
   to make your own fun crostini creations. It’s summer and summer is all
   about flying by the seat of your pants right?!?

   Ahh, wait, I don’t think I’ve ever done that…never mind. Just have fun
   with these and use them as a guide to help you build the best ever
   crostini station in all the land. Your friends are going to be so
   jealous of your epic crostini making skills.

   YES…clearly I am a little competitive. ?

   Summer Crostini 6 Ways | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest Sooo here we
   go… Summer Crostini 6 Ways!

   Crostini 1: crusty grilled sourdough bread, smashed avocado, charred
   corn, cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, crumbled feta, lemon zest, kosher
   salt + pepper. This one is basically summer on toast. You can’t beat
   its simpler classic flavors. Everyone love it.

   Crostini 2: crusty grilled sourdough bread, fig preserves, burrata
   cheese, prosciutto, fresh fig, fresh thyme + basil, flaky salt + pepper
   and a drizzle of honey (or honeycomb). Possibly my favorite combo of
   all, this one is just mouth-wateringly GOOD. But I do really love figs,
   and I also really LOVE burrata.

   Crostini 3: crusty grilled honey whole wheat bread, goat cheese, fresh
   cherries, fresh basil, aged balsamic vinegar, olive oil, flaky salt and
   pepper. Umm, YUM… cherries all summer long… please and thank you!

   Crostini 4: crusty grilled honey whole wheat bread, melted cheddar
   cheese, blueberry jam, fresh thyme + honey + fresh blueberries for
   garnish. Promise this one is not as weird as it may seem. It’s
   surprisingly delicious, and if you love the combo of sharp cheddar to
   sweet fruit you will love this toast.

   Crostini 5: crusty grilled sourdough bread, blue cheese, grilled
   peaches, chipotle honey + toasted pumpkin seeds and a sprinkle of flaky
   salt. OK, I lied, this one might just might be my favorite. The combo
   of bold blue cheese, to sweet grilled peach, to smoky sweet chipotle
   honey is truly one of the best things ever. DO IT.

   Crostini 6: crusty grilled sourdough bread or honey whole wheat bread,
   melted Brie, fresh strawberries, basil, aged balsamic vinegar, sweet
   honeycomb (or just a drizzle of honey) and a pinch of flaky salt. I
   mean, I mean!?!? Does that even need more of an explanation? This one
   is mom’s favorite.

   And DONE. Don’t those all sounds kind of amazing?!? And yes, I really,
   really like my cheese and fruit combos…you can just never go wrong
   there.

       Thanks so much for these great crostini ideas !! They are just what
       I needed because I
       can’t have a 4th of July BBQ this year! We will have these with
       champagne to say good-bye here in my old house as I move on to a
       new flat. Just me and my lovely small family!! PERFECT. Happy
       Monday back to you. All the best, Danielle ( an American living in
       the UK. )

       What a gorgeous looking crostini. Summer got just better with these
       little treats. Though all 6 crostini looks fab, Crostini 1 would be
       my fav! 😀

       I have an excellent cup of coffee in front of me, but I am about to
       get a second cup. Here I am wishing I could have one or two of the
       above to accompany that second cup. Your food photography has a way
       of capturing my attention and prompting me to get into the kitchen.
       Loving the crostini recipes and opening your morning e.mails ~!!

       I’m pretty much a fan of anything that involves bread, so I’m all
       about these wonderful seasonal creations! And I love that you
       played around with different types of breads (and that they’re all
       grilled… because grilled bread is magical).

       All of these look so good that I’m not sure I could choose! Maybe
       because I’m obsessed with cherries,, I would go for that one first!

            Hey Pam! Thank you so much! Whipped burrata is just burrata
            that you whisk vigorously with a spoon until smooth and
            creamy. Not as fancy as it sounds but super good! Let me know
            if you have other questions, thanks!

       I cannot even!! I literally am sitting here at my desk and feel my

       imagine how amazing they will taste! I actually am planning on
       making a kalamata olive, marinated artichoke heart and tomato
       bruschetta tonight, but one of these might make the dessert
       platter!!

       and I don’t have cheese, but I’m sure I can find a good vegan cream
       cheese substitute and use whole wheat sourdough for these recipes!

       Can I ask how you char your corn? Is there a way to do it inside
       instead of on a grill? I have a gas stove and oven, please guide
       me! So many of your amazing recipes have charred corn in them.
       Can’t wait to try them all!

       Your photography is as amazing as your recipes! You really need to
       do a cookbook! It would be a beautiful addition to any
       cook’s/foodie’s collection and proudly displayed! I would give as
       birthday, Christmas, wedding shower or hostess gifts!
       Like you, I love to create new options for crostini, always a crowd
       pleaser. THANKS for inspiring me with new and gorgeous ideas! My
       friends always request my Classic tomatoe & basil over herbed goat
       cheese on a French baguette toasted with olive oil and cayenne, but
       next garden party I am going to mix it up!

       These all look and sound delicious. Looking forward to creating a
       few of my own and try these. One question, in the #5 crostini you
       mention a Chipotle Honey, which sounds amazing. Did you make this
       by adding the two ingredients together or is something you bought?

            It’s literally just a little honey and a chipotle pepper mixed
            together. I use 1/2 cup honey and 1-2 peppers. Please let me
            know if you have other questions. Hope you love this recipe!
            Happy Holiday’s 🎄 🙂

   BOO! Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars. You don’t need to be a professional
   baker to make these deliciously EASY homemade Halloween treats. These
   bars require no oven time, use just 6 pantry staple ingredients, are
   made without extra sugar, and take almost no effort to make. Best part?
   They’re fun to make no matter what your age!
   BOO! Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars on serving trey with candy pumpkins
   and a spoon

   BOO! It’s Friday, it’s October, and that means I’m finally sharing some
   Halloween inspired treats.

   You know what I love most about Halloween? No matter what age you are,
   it’s an excuse to dress up, have fun, eat candy, and just let the kid
   in you shine for a day. For someone who’s way too serious most of the
   time, this is so good for me. All month long I have so much fun being
   creative and making Halloween inspired treats, crafts, and of course,
   cocktails.

   These bars are some of my favorites of the month for two reasons.

   One, and most importantly, these bars are GOOD. Like so deliciously
   good. You all know I love the combo of chocolate and peanut butter. In
   fact I’ve been called out for using it too much…sorry, but not really
   because I love it!

   Peanut butter and chocolate. Simple and Perfect.

   Two, these bars are EASY. So, so, so easy. Easy enough that if you can
   make yourself a peanut butter sandwich, you can certainly make these
   bars. It’s true.
   BOO! Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars before chilling in pan

   As mentioned, these are made using six pantry staple ingredients.
   Honey, maple syrup, peanut butter, chocolate, and white chocolate,
   that’s it. Yep, no additional sugar.

   To make the bar base, melt together the honey, maple, and peanut butter
   until smooth and creamy. Stir in the corn flakes and dump the mixture
   out onto a baking pan.

   Now add a very thick, even layer of melted chocolate (you can use dark,
   semi-sweet, or milk, use you favorite!). Next, take some melted white
   chocolate (use high quality, trust me it makes a difference) and dollop
   it in teaspoon and tablespoon size right over the chocolate. Grab a
   skinny stick (I used the end of a skinny spoon) and gently pull the
   white chocolate down to create a “ghost” shape (see above photo). Add
   eyes using sprinkles or melted chocolate.

   Chill. Cut into bars.

   And DONE.
   BOO! Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars before making ghost

   See? Pretty easy, right?

   And don’t stress about making these perfect. The more imperfect, the
   spookier they look.

   Also, you will notice that my ghosts do not have mouths. I wish I could
   say this was intentional, but it was really just a careless mistake on
   my part. You know what though? I kind love these little guys just the
   way they are. They’re nothing close to a perfect looking ghost, but
   each is unique, ghostly, and fun.

   trey

   Honest truth? No matter how much I would LOVE to be skilled in
   decorating beautiful desserts, it’s not my talent. I can’t pipe
   frosting all that well, I can’t make perfectly frosted sugar cookies
   with royal icing, and I am not going to spend five hours trying to make
   my Halloween treats look perfectly “spooky”.

   Nope, I’m not a pro at decorating and I’m fine with that. Over the
   years I’ve learned to love and embrace the “imperfect” look. The
   awesome thing about Halloween treats is that the more imperfect they
   look, the better.

   It’s all about that messed up, spooky vibe, so embrace your mistakes,
   especially with these bars. No one ghost should look another.
   side angle photo of BOO! Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars

   Above all, have fun and be creative with these! These bars are great
   for making with kids, and enjoyed by EVERYONE. You can pack them up and
   take them to the school Halloween party, or serve them at your adult
   filled Halloween bash.

   Whatever route you go, these ghostly bars will be loved and devoured.
   Hence, making a double batch is highly recommended.

   Lastly, if you make these spooky chocolate peanut butter bars, please
   be sure to leave a comment and/or give this recipe a rating! Above all,
   I love to hear from you guys and always do my best to respond to each
   and every comment. And of course, if you do make this recipe, don’t
   forget to also tag me on Instagram! Looking through the photos of
   recipes you all have made is my favorite!

   The Recipe

BOO! Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars

   These bars require no oven time, use just 6 pantry staple ingredients,
   and take almost no effort to make. Best part? They're fun to make no
   matter what your age!
   Prep Time 20 minutes
   Cook Time 10 minutes
   Total Time 30 minutes
   Servings 0 about 16-18 bars
   Calories 296 kcal

Ingredients

     * 1/2 cup honey
     * 1/2 cup real maple syrup
     * 1 cup creamy peanut butter
     * 6 cups corn flakes
     * 8-12 ounces semi-sweet or dark chocolate, melted
     * 6 ounces white chocolate, melted
     * black sprinkles, for decorating (optional)

Instructions

    1. 1. Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper.
       2. In a large, microwave safe bowl, melt together the honey, maple,
       and peanut butter until smooth, about 30 second to 1 minute. Stir
       in the corn flakes, tossing well to combine. Spread the mix out
       into the prepared pan, packing it in tightly.
       3. Melt the chocolate chips and pour the melted chocolate over the
       bars, spreading in and even layer.
       4. To make the ghosts. Melt the white chocolate, then spoon a small
       dollop (1 teaspoon for small ghosts  and 1 tablespoon for large
       ghosts) of white chocolate onto the chocolate, making sure each
       ghost is 1 inch apart from each other. Using a wooden skewers or
       the end of a skinny spoon, gently drag the white chocolate into a
       ghost shape, don't worry about making these perfect, the more
       imperfect they look, the better.
       5. Insert 2 small sprinkles for eyes or use additional melted
       chocolate.
       6. Transfer the bars to the fridge and chill 1 hour or until set.
       Using a sharp knife, cut around the ghost, creating irregular
       shapes. Keep in the fridge until ready to serve. BOO!

Recipe Notes

   *These bars are GOOEY and we like them this way. If you'd like a bar
   that's less gooey, reduce the maple 1/4 cup and use 1/4 cup brown
   sugar.

       Hello!!
       These look so cute and so good I really want to try making these!!
       I was wondering though how did you get the chocolate to harden? I
       was thinking when I made your brownies with chocolate peanut butter
       and rice crispys the chocolate layer never hardened and stayed
       fudge like, even when I put it in the fridge. Is it suppose to be a
       hardened chocolate layer? How do I make sure I achieve and that and
       not a poor attempt for fudge? Thank you!

            HI! Hmm, that is so odd. I have never had my chocolate not
            harden up, especially once chilled. What kind of chocolate are
            you using? Are you mixing anything into the chocolate that
            might cause it to not harden? Hope I can help and sorry for
            the trouble!

       This looks delish! I always make a cute Halloween treat for my kids
       and this will be it this year! If you were to use Rice Krispies
       instead, would you use the same measurements?

            October 13, 2018 at 11:02 PM
            Hi! I would probably use close to 7 cups rice krispies since
            rice krispies are a bit smaller in size, but just add more as
            needed until you feel like you have a good peanut butter to
            cereal ratio. Please let me know if you have any other
            questions. I hope you love this recipe. Thanks so much!

            I do! Use an equal amount or up to 1 cup more rice krispies
            since they are a bit smaller in size. Please let me know if
            you have any other questions. I hope you love this recipe.

       This recipe in your cookbook calls for an additional 1/2 cup sugar.
       Why is it omitted here?

       These turned out so cute and they were easy! The only problem I had
       was, even after chilling, the corn flake layer was gooey and a
       little more moist then I think would have been ideal. Not sure if
       it was our ingredients or we measured something wrong, or if that’s
       just how they are. I would make them again though, but I might
       experiment with the ingredients a bit to see if I could get a less
       moist bottom layer.

            Hey CJ! The bottom layer is meant to be gooey. If you want
            something drier, try adding more cornflakes to “soak” up the
            peanut butter. Please let me know if you have any other
            questions. So glad you love this recipe. Thanks so much!

       Chocolate peanut butter ANYTHING is a winning combination. I love
       cereal bars–they are super crunchy, sweet, and perfect for any
       snack. Happy Halloween!

       Loved these BUT as others have noted, they were super gooey and the
       bottom did not hold well together. They were delicious (what’s not
       to love with PB and chocolate?!) but I followed the recipe as is
       and let them sit overnight and still barely hold together. Would
       need to adjust the recipe to consider making again.

       How did you make the spiderwebs? Concentric circles and used
       toothpick to pull from the middle? I think I’m going to make a
       double batch for a Halloween potluck at work!

            Hey Alix!
            To make webs, pipe the white chocolate into circle spirals.
            Starting at the center of each spiral, drag a toothpick across
            the chocolate moving out to create a webbing effect. Repeat
            this process around the entire circle and then and the
            remaining spirals.
            Please let me know if you have other questions. I hope you
            love this recipe! thanks so much! xTieghan

       I made these last night and t hey came out great! I opted for the
       version with brown sugar and less maple syrup so they’d be less
       gooey. They seem to be holding together nicely. I’m giving them to
       friends who are watching my cats while I go away on vacation. I am
       sure they will be a hit. My ghost making skills are pretty poor
       though but they sure do taste delicious!! Thank you for the great
       recipes. Oh also super easy to make!!

       Hi, I made these bars tonight and they really are yummy. Since
       Halloween is over, I decided to just do a random drizzle with the
       white chocolate. I used Nestle toll house white chocolate chips but
       they didn’t want to melt. I put them in the microwave and they
       became very dry so I started over using a double boiler. That was
       better but it still didn’t melt enough for drizzling. Did I use the
       wrong kind of white chocolate? Even though they weren’t beautiful,
       they tasted great! I will try again after I hear from you. Thanks
       for your time.

            Hey Becky! Some brands of white chocolate do not melt well. I
            recommend ghirardelli white chocolate and melted at a very,
            very low temperature. LOW heat on the stover, stirring
            consistently is best. Please let me know if you have any other
            questions. So glad you love this recipe. Thanks so much and
            happy Thanksgiving! xTieghan

       I’ve made these bars twice. Once as a gift and received lots of
       compliments and again this week for our company cookie swap. These
       bars won the cookie swap contest!! So easy to make and SO

   Thanks for joining me for another Nine Favorite Things post.Happy first
   Sunday of October! Hoping you all are enjoying fall as much as I am! Up
   here in the mountains, we (very sadly) are on the downward side of the
   fall foliage peak. Our fall leaves were the absolute prettiest (see
   photos below). I am so sad our colors are waning, but loving our still
   warm days and cool crisp nights. Fall is my favorite. All things cozy,
   all the time.At this moment in time I'm feeling the full emotional
   spectrum...excited, so happy, grateful, nervous, anxious...basically
   everything. As we get closer and closer to the release of HBH Super
   Simple, my nerves continue to build. I just hope so much that you all
   will love this cookbook. It's always so scary putting something out
   into the world, but fingers crossed you all will love the new recipes.
   I hope you'll find them delicious, easy, and very

   recipes, photographing my creations, feeding my family, and making one
   giant mess in the process. My hope is to inspire a love for food in
   others, as well as the courage to try something new.
