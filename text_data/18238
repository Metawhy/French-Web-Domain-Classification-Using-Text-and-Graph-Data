   Come Visit Strands of Pearls
   [Audrey-in-How-To-Steal-a-Million-audrey-hepburn-4476191-720-480.jpg]
   "For attractive lips,Speak words of kindness. For lovely eyes, Seek out
   the good in people. For a slim figure, Share your food with the hungry
   For beautiful hair, Let a child run his/her fingers through it once a
   day. For poise,Walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone.
   People, even more than things, Have to be restored, renewed, revived,
   reclaimed,And redeemed; never throw out anyone. Remember, if you ever
   need a helping hand, You will find one at the end of each of your arms.
   As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands; One for
   helping yourself, and the other for helping others"
   Audrey Hepburn [Eloise2.jpg] [FF001.jpg] Strands of Pearls also
   celebrates some of my favorite things- curling up with a book that
   makes you forget which century you are in, watching any Cary Grant
   movie, reading cookbooks, poking through antique shops in search of
   whatever you are collecting this week, planning the perfect getaway,
   buying a new bag, redecorating your home and maybe even your life...and
   oh if you are going to spend time with me, there is a good chance you
   will be knitting! Please come visit when you can. I will share my
   favorite finds from my favorite places in life to play. All things
   irresistible, inspiring and full of joy! [xy.jpg] Strands of Pearls

   seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out
   into the open and has other people looking at it. Winnie the Pooh, The
