Huawei set to unveil mapping service in October

   Huawei Technologies Co said it plans to unveil its own mapping service
   in October, as the Chinese tech giant works hard to cope with the US
   government's ban on using Google Map in its overseas smartphones.

   Huawei's mapping service, known as Map Kit, is not directly for
   consumer use, but is designed to encourage software developers to come
   up with applications based on its mapping capabilities.

   Huawei Map Kit will be connected to local mapping services and covers
   150 countries and regions.

   The US travel aggregator website Booking Holdings is among the software
   companies that are partnering with Huawei on the mapping service, a
   source familiar with the matter told China Daily.

   The move is crucial to maintaining Huawei smartphones' overseas
   popularity. Zhang Pingan, president of cloud services at Huawei's
   consumer business group, said that more than 50 percent of mobile
   applications are location-based services relying on mapping
   capabilities.

   Huawei Map Kit will be available in 40 languages. It will offer
   real-time traffic conditions and a highly sophisticated navigation
   system which can recognize a car changing lanes. It will also support
   augmented-reality mapping, Zhang said.

   Washington put Huawei on its Entity List in May, banning it from buying
   US technologies without special government approval. Starting in late
   July, some US suppliers have been gradually resuming sales to Huawei,
   but the Chinese company still does not have access to crucial US
   technologies such as updates of Google's Android operating system and
   Google Map in its new smartphones.

   Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, said the US
   government restrictions reduce the annual shipment forecast of its
   smartphones from about 300 million units to around 240 million units in
   2019.

   Xiang Ligang, director-general of the telecom industry association
   Information Consumption Alliance, said though Huawei is a latecomer in
   mapping service, it has telecom base stations in over 160 countries and
   regions, which can offer complementing information to satellite
   positioning data and thus provide better mapping services.

   The move is part of Huawei's broader push to build a more robust mobile
   application ecosystem. The company unveiled its in-house operating
   system HarmonyOS on Friday, and there is a pressing need for it to
   attract more software developers to make applications for the system.

E-shoppers embrace smart apps

   Intelligent software helps customize product recommendations and sales

   Chinese e-retailers are using artificial intelligence or AI to enhance
   and redefine the entire shopping experience for the consumer.

   In doing so, they are dispelling the notion that the newage technology
   is all about driverless cars, futuristic robots and supercomputers such
   as the Go (that beat human players in a complex board game).

   For instance, Tencent Holdings Ltd, known for its killer app WeChat and
   video game apps, is deploying AI to recommend products and services to
   users of its mobile wallet WeChat Pay.

   Such users win virtual red packets containing real cash for offline
   purchases, which can be redeemed later in online shopping at partner
   sites.

   According to Ren Yuxin, Tencent's chief operating officer, the company
   is also empowering partner merchants to personalize their virtual
   storefronts for individual visitors. The idea is to offer real-time,
   tailor-made product recommendations based on a variety of factors like
   age, gender, location and purchasing power.

   Tencent has also teamed up with China's second-largest online site
   JD.com, offering merchants customized content marketing opportunities
   via WeChat's Moments, an information-sharing function, banking on
   algorithms that analyze a person's interests, location and purchasing
   power.

   Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the world's largest e-commerce site by
   transaction volume, has embedded AI into its digital infrastructure,
   aiming to provide more precise search results and relevant product
   recommendations to users, and thus drive sales.

   The tech giant has developed a so-called "E-commerce Brain" to
   understand people's needs and deliver relevant holistic
   recommendations.

   By adopting real-time online data to build models to predict what
   consumers want, the system generates recommendations for not only
   products they have shown an interest in but related products and other
   information.

   "Alibaba's Brain can home in on a consumer's predilections for certain
   products, price ranges, brands, product specifications and other key
   parameters," said Zhao Binqiang, an algorithm expert at Alibaba who now
   leads the firm's digital marketing unit.

   The software works in tandem with Alibaba's vast social media networks.
   Algorithms allow the system to determine correlations between content
   consumption and purchasing behavior.

   For example, if a mother has purchased diapers via Alibaba's Taobao
   site, she is likely to receive maternity and child-care related content
   from Weitao, a micro-blogging service for brands, or from Taobao
   Headlines, a sister newsfeed. Via such online destinations, she might
   receive sponsored content on products such as infant formula or
   supplements.

   Alibaba also introduced an AI-powered electronic assistant or chatbot
   called Ali Xiaomi (Ali Assistant) to handle up to 95 percent of general
   inquiries ranging from refunds to complaints.

   According to Alibaba, the chatbot, when provided with a text or voice
   description or even a photo, can even help users find products,
   returning a list of recommendations that they could filter by brand,
   color and other characteristics.

   A Goldman Sachs report earlier this year said, "Big data, cloud
   services and the coming of age of machine learning technology should
   continue to deliver a personalized shopping experience to consumers and
   targeted marketing solutions to brands and merchants."

   Now, fake hairy crabs
   ( 2003-10-21 16:43) (eastday.com)

   Hairy crab lovers should also try crustaceans bred in Hongze Lake or
   Boyang Lake, two large freshwater pools, instead of just sticking to
   those from the famous Yangcheng Lake, fishery experts suggested
   yesterday.

   The advice comes after many fake crabs purported to be from the
   Yangcheng Lake, regarded as China's best origin of hairy crab, were
   found in local markets.

   "If you see a crab with a 'Yangcheng Lake' imprint on its shell, don't
   be fooled as such laser prints can be made on any crabs for a certain
   fee," said an anonymous vendor at the Tongchuan Road Aquatic Products
   Market, the largest local market of its kind.

   More than 100,000 tons of hairy crabs bearing the "Yangcheng Lake"
   stamp were sold last year. However, the output of authentic ones was
   just 1,500 tons, the Yangcheng Lake Crab Trade Association, which
   manages production and sales of the delicious aquatic product, said.

   In a bid to curb fakes, the association began issuing intelligent cards
   to breeders this year. With the card, breeders can have crabs printed
   with a laser tag of trademarks and a serial number.

   But some breeders have been known to lend their cards to other dealers.

   What's more, some unscrupulous businessmen have bought special printers
   to produce fake laser tags, selling them in towns around Yangcheng
   Lake.

   Paying 0.5 yuan (6 US Cents) for each tag, breeders can print any brand
   name on the crabs.

   "The association has 11 laser printers. But private operators own more
   machines," Yang Weilong, director of the association, bemoaned.

   When authentic crabs are mixed with fake ones carrying the same prints,
   the breeders themselves can't distinguish them, he added.

Ban extended to more Taiwan food imports

By He Dan (China Daily)
Updated: 2011-06-05 08:03

          [A.jpg] Large Medium Small

          Two mainland brands also restricted in action against plastic
          additives

          BEIJING - The mainland's top quality watchdog has stepped up its
          ban on imports of products from Taiwan that have been
          contaminated by an industrial chemical used to soften plastic
          packaging.

          In its latest update on the import ban posted on its official
          website on Saturday, the General Administration of Quality
          Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said the mainland
          would suspend imports of 858 kinds of products, including
          beverages, food products and food additives, made by 255
          companies in Taiwan.

          On the blacklist: asparagus juice made by the popular brand
          Uni-President as well as a number of children's products, such
          as the nutrition brand Karihome made by Taiwan Direct Biological
          Technology Company.

          Meanwhile, the State Food and Drug Administration has suspended
          the production and sale of two health products for containing
          toxic phthalate acid esters (PAEs) made by two companies in the
          mainland on Friday.

          The banned products are Lingzhi spores powder produced by
          Beijing Xiehe Medicine Industry Co, Ltd and pills of multi-amino
          acid made by Qingdao Meizhong Natural Biotechnological products
          Company in Qingdao city, in East China's Shandong province.

          The administration stipulated in a notice on its official
          website that other health-food companies should also stop
          producing products containing the inedible plasticizer. It also
          requires the producers to recall all the illegal products in the
          market.

          Taiwan list expanded

          The new list of banned Taiwan products is much longer than the
          original one issued by the AQSIQ on June 1, when the quality
          watchdog said the mainland would suspend imports of 22 kinds of
          beverages, food products and food additives from Taiwan that are
          produced by companies suspected of using bis (2-ethylhexyl)
          phthalate (DEHP).

          The food-safety commission under the State Council, or cabinet,
          has also ordered increased inspections and instant recalls of
          beverages, food products and additives contaminated with DEHP.

          The cancer-causing plasticizer DEHP in food and drinks can lead
          to kidney or testicular damage and fertility problems, if
          consumed regularly and accumulated in human bodies. Children are
          the most vulnerable group to such hazardous effects.

          Economic impact

          The DEHP scandal will act as a hard hit on the beverage industry
          in Taiwan, which is expected to suffer a loss of NT$500 million
          (113.6 million yuan), Chang Jui-chuan, secretary general of the
          Taiwan Beverage Industries Association, was quoted by Taiwan
          Central News Agency as saying.

          So far, it is not clear whether food and beverage producers in
          the mainland have been illegally adding DEHP to their products,
          experts said.

          However, about 20 kinds of plasticizers have been widely used in
          commodities such as packing materials, plastic containers for
          cooking oil and toys, which have potential risks for the
          public's health, said Dong Jinshi, executive vice-president of
          the International Food Packaging Association.

          "For example, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) wrappers usually contain
          DEHP. If these are being used to wrap food with high fat or
          being heated in a microwave, the food will be polluted," Dong
          told China Daily on Saturday.

          Dong pointed out that some food producers' lack of the knowledge
          about what additives can be used and how to use them is an
          important reason for the soaring food accidents.

          "The government should make it compulsory for food producers to
          learn relevant information and regulations to prevent more food
          scandals from happening," Dong said.

          Given the expanding trade in agricultural and food products
          between the mainland and Taiwan, it's urgent for the two sides
          to strengthen cooperation in food-safety management, said Sang
          Liwei, a food-safety lawyer and the China representative of the
          Global Food Safety Forum.
