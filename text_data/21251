   market opportunities.
   Then align sales and marketing around the best targets.

FIND YOUR BEST MARKETS. ENGAGE WITH INTELLIGENCE. OPTIMIZE FOR GROWTH.

   Successful CMOs and CROs are deliberate about growth. They understand
   their best customers and know exactly who to target. Then they give
   their teams the go-to-market tools to make it happen.

   InsideView Go-To-Market Solutions give you that same power, letting you
   pinpoint the types of customers you want to win, then showing you who
   they are — even if they’re not in your CRM system.

   When it’s time for sales and marketing to execute, they’ll get
   everything they need to win. InsideView fuels their go-to-market
   strategies. They’ll know who to target, why and when to reach out, and
   how to connect. And your leadership teams will track and analyze market
   performance, at every stage of the funnel, to adjust and optimize in
   real time.

IT’S TIME TO OWN THE WORLD THAT MATTERS.

   Companies meeting or exceeding their revenue targets are 2.3 times more
   likely to report high levels of sales and marketing alignment. At the
   same time, fewer than half (only 47%) of sales and marketing
   organizations work as aligned teams. What’s worse, just 15% of
   companies claim their teams are orchestrated in their go-to-market
   efforts.

   Alignment is not only foundational to modern targeted go-to-market
   strategies, it directly leads to 36% more growth, 36% higher customer
   retention rates, faster profit growth, higher win rates, and more reps
   making quota.
