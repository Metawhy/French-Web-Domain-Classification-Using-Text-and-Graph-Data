   Habitat

Where do African buffalo live?

   They inhabit a wide range of habitats, including semi-arid bushland and
   montane grasslands to coastal savannas and lowland rainforests — as
   long as they are close to a water source. In general, they are
   distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa and are found throughout the
   northern and southern savanna as well as the lowland rainforest.


   Physical Characteristics

What is a buffalo?

   There is only one species of buffalo in Africa, but four distinct
   subspecies exist: forest buffalo, West African savanna buffalo, Central
   African buffalo, and southern savanna buffalo.

   Savanna buffaloes are large, heavy cow-like animals. They vary greatly
   not only in size but in the shapes of their horns and their coloring.
   Adults are usually dark gray or black (or even look red or white if
   they have been wallowing in mud of that color) and the young are often
   reddish-brown. The smaller forest buffalo maintains the red color even
   as an adult, although in western Uganda, many savanna buffaloes are
   also red or pale orange instead of black. Adults lose hair as they age.

   Both males and females have heavy, ridged horns that grow straight out
   from the head or curve downward and then up. The horns are formidable
   weapons against predators and are used when jostling for space within
   the herd; males use the horns in fights for dominance.

   Behavior & Diet

Grass forms the bulk of the buffalo’s diet.

   Food sources play more of an important role than predation in
   regulating population numbers. Without fresh green feed, buffaloes
   deteriorate rapidly. They devote a large portion of their time to
   grazing and feeding. After grazing on grass, just like cows, they spend
   time chewing their cud (or bolus) to extract even more nutrients from
   their food.

Buffalo sometimes congregate by the thousands.

   They can live in herds of a few hundred but have been known to
   congregate in thousands in the Serengeti during the rainy season.
   Congregating in large herds is one of their many anti-predator
   adaptations. Large herds decrease the possibility of any individual
   being singled out by lions. The females and their offspring make up the
   bulk of the herd. Males may spend much of their time in bachelor
   groups. These groups are of two types, those that contain males from 4
   to 7 years old and those that have males 12 years and older. The older
   bulls often prefer to be on their own.

Births typically occur during the rainy season.

   Females have their first calves at age four or five. They usually calve
   only every two years, and most births occur at the end of the rainy
   season when abundant grass improves the nutritional level for females
   when they are pregnant or nursing. The female and her offspring have an
   unusually intense and prolonged relationship. Males do not invest in
   their offspring. Calves are suckled for as long as a year and during
   this time are completely dependant on their mothers. Female offspring
   usually stay in the natal herd, but males leave when they are about
   four years old.

Buffalo’s senses are quite poor.

   Their sight and hearing are both rather poor, but their scent is well
   developed in African buffalos. They also seem to have a relatively
   difficult time regulating body temperature—the reason why they feed
   mostly at night. Although they are quiet for the most part, the animals
   do communicate. In mating seasons they grunt and emit hoarse bellows,
   and a calf in danger will bellow mournfully, bringing herd members
   running at a gallop to defend it.

Challenges

African buffaloes frequently come into conflict with humans.

   Outside national parks, these giants are considered crop pests and are
   seen as dangerous animals due to their size, aggressive nature, and
   formidable horns. In East Africa, they are known to break fences, raid
   cultivated crops, and they may even spread bovine diseases to
   livestock. In the past, they suffered their most dramatic population
   decline during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s. This also
   coupled with pleuro-pneumonia and caused mortalities as high as 95
   percent among livestock and wild buffalo.

Habitat fragmentation threatens the African buffalo.

   Their habitat is threatened by fragmentation, which is caused when land
   is divided by unsustainable development.

Solutions

   Our solutions to conserving the buffalo:
     * Work with governments.
       African Wildlife Foundation works with government entities to help
       plan and propose alternative solutions to habitat fragmentation by
       providing its scientists as resources to assist in proper planning
       to ensure a balance between growth and modernization and wildlife
       conservation.
     * Engage communities.
       We work with communities to help meet their agricultural needs
       through proper planning and techniques for sustainable agricultural
       growth. By providing these resources, AWF is able to minimize land
       used for agriculture, thereby minimizing impact on local wildlife,
       while helping to minimize food security and income for people.
