Help support a great cause by buying this 1969 Honda Z50A K1

   I recently met the man who runs Lil’ Bikes Restoration in Brownsburg,
   Indiana. He restores Honda Z50 and CT70 motorcycles.

   Over the course of the next week, he’s auctioning off a 1969 Honda Z50A
   K1. The proceeds will go to breast cancer awareness via the American
   Cancer Society.

If you’re looking for a casual jacket with some protection built-in, check
out the Scorpion Covert Hoody.

   The Scorpion Covert Hoody is a unique item that looks like street
   clothes. It’s nice riding in regular street clothes, but we all know
   that regular street clothes don’t offer much protection at all, which
   is why this jacket makes so much sense.

   It’s simple, looks like pretty much any other hoody you’d grab off the
   shelf, and offers some much-needed protection.

   alternative. It offers some minor protection with a casual look and

   Lil’ Bikes Restoration Breast Cancer Awareness 1969 Honda Z50A K1

Help support a great cause by buying this 1969 Honda Z50A K1

   I recently met the man who runs Lil’ Bikes Restoration in Brownsburg,
   Indiana. He restores Honda Z50 and CT70 motorcycles.

   Over the course of the next week, he’s auctioning off a 1969 Honda Z50A
   K1. The proceeds will go to breast cancer awareness via the American
   Cancer Society.

If you’re looking for a casual jacket with some protection built-in, check
out the Scorpion Covert Hoody.

   The Scorpion Covert Hoody is a unique item that looks like street
   clothes. It’s nice riding in regular street clothes, but we all know
   that regular street clothes don’t offer much protection at all, which
   is why this jacket makes so much sense.

   It’s simple, looks like pretty much any other hoody you’d grab off the
   shelf, and offers some much-needed protection.

15 Best Cafe Racer Gloves

   15 Best Cafe Racer Gloves

Looking for the best cafe racer gloves? This is the list for you.

   Owning a cafe racer is a way of life. It’s a style and a culture that’s
   unlike other sub-segments of the motorcycling community. As a part of
   that, you should have the right cafe racer gear too.

   I’ve discussed cafe racer helmets and jackets before, but now I want to
   focus on one of my personal favorite pieces of gear, gloves. The
   following 15 pairs of gloves are imbibed with cafe racer style and give
   you some added protection, too. Here’s the list.

Simpson M50 Helmet

   Simpson M50 Helmet

The Simpson M50 Helmet offers retro styling with a modern design.

   The Simpson M50 Helmet takes the classic design that Simpson usually
   has with its lids to a whole new level. The helmet design is extremely
   retro and extremely handsome.

   The style blends a kind of streetfighter with a vintage motocross
   design into a new helmet that can be worn on anything from a cruiser to
   a cafe racer to a scrambler to a streetfighter. If you have a badass
   bike, this is the helmet for you.

Mounsiff Yettefti’s Suzuki GSX400 Cafe Racer

   Mounsiff Yettefti’s Suzuki GSX400 Cafe Racer

This Suzuki GSX400 Cafe Racer is one of the most interesting I’ve ever seen.

   My hat is off to Mounsiff Yettefti. The man has built one of the most
   interesting and beautiful Suzuki GSX400 Cafe Racer motorcycles in the
   world.

   The fashion addict has a motorcycle that is as stylish and
   eye-catching. Yettefti lives in Amsterdam in the Netherlands so there’s
   likely no chance I’ll ever see this bike in person, but I sure would
   love to.

Scorpion EXO-CT220 Helmet Review

   Scorpion EXO-CT220 Helmet Review

The Scorpion EXO-CT220 helmet is a modern open-face lid.

   Love the feel of an older open face helmet, but sick of the old-school

   thoroughly modern and brings with it good style, too.

   Here are some thoughts about this unique helmet.
