Where are the old apps and pages?

   The old apps and pages are still available here. They will be migrated
   from the old site as updated versions are published.

How to use this site

   This site is a repository of apps for owners of Drobo NAS devices, such
   as the DroboFS and the Drobo5N. Its primary audience is the heavy-duty
   Linux users, the kind that thinks package management is for newbies,
   but we also try to accomodate end-users as much as possible.

   In other words, what is offered here is the lowest level possible of
   instructions to get from the source code (of both application and
   libraries) all the way to packaging the binaries as DroboApps. This
   means also instructions on how to setup the cross-compiling
   environment.

   With that being said, not everyone has the time to start the procedure
   from scratch. Therefore, each DroboApp will have a "releases" page with
   links to ready-to-deploy packages and some additional instructions to
   install and configure each app.

   Most of the time, it is just a matter of downloading the TGZ file,
   copying it in the DroboApps share of your Drobo, and rebooting it.

   All the DroboApps are packaged in a way that makes them as ready-to-go
   as possible, and many will just work out-of-the-box without any further
   configuration. Additional configuration, if necessary, will be
   indicated in the releases' description.

What should I install on my Drobo5N/DroboFS?

   It depends on what you want to do with it. If you are a command-line
   fellow, then start with OpenSSH, bash, and wget with SSL support. After
   that have a look at the other command-line utilities. If you need to
   remote admin the Drobo, you might want to install OpenVPN and Puppet.
   Developers will be interested in git.

   Both the Drobo5N and the DroboFS make for pretty decent
   torrent/newsgroup downloader boxes. Have a look at rtorrent,
   transmission and nzbget. If you are thinking about automating your
   downloads, you'll probably also need Lighttpd, PHP, and Python (and
   some of the Python packages too). These are fairly large DroboApps and
   might be a little complicated to setup, so head on to the DroboSpace
   forums to get some help.

   While the DroboFS is a pretty capable file/media server, the Drobo5N is
   an excellent choice. You can host your own content or blog using Apache
   and MySQL (use a Drobo5N for an optimal performance). If you want to
   access it over the internet, ProFTPd seems to be the best FTP server
   available. If you are in an Unix environment (*BSD, Linux, Mac OS X),
   you might want to get the kernel version of the NFS server. If you are
   looking to stream media to TVs/DVD players/set-top boxes/Android
   devices, then minidlna is the app for you. Unfortunately, due to
   Apple's restrictive policies and DRM schemes, there isn't a good
   solution to serve Apple media (movies in particular) available so far.

   Finally, both the Drobo5N and the DroboFS are the perfect backup
   destinations. If you are a Linux user, then you might wanna pickup the
   latest rsync. The CrashPlan client can backup your Drobo5N/FS to the
   cloud.
