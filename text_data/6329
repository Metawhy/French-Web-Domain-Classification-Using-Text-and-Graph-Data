   ‚ÄúTo remove physical obstacles asanas (postures) need to be practised.
   To remove obstacles from the pranic sheath and the breathing pattern,
   pranayama is advised. To remove obstacles from the mind yogic
   meditation is engaged in. For swift success, these three methods need
   to be combined.‚Äù

ABOUT ASHTANGA YOGA

   green underline

   Ashtanga yoga is a lifelong spiritual practice for those seeking
   clarity and self-realisation. It is a holistic practice that purifies
   the body, breath and mind, leading you to the knowledge of your
   innermost nature.


   It was first described by an ancient sage called Patanjali in his
   infamous text, the Yoga Sutras. He defined yoga as ‚Äúthe stilling of the
   fluctuations of the mind‚Äù, and Ashtanga means ‚Äúeight limbs‚Äù. So
   Ashtanga yoga is the practice of these eight limbs in order to
   experience the calm and peaceful state of yoga.


   The eight limbs include: the yamas and niyamas (observances and
   restraints), asana (postures), pranayama (breath control), pratyahara
   (sense control), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation) and
   Samadhi (absorption).


   It is my goal to always stay true to this original definition of
   Ashtanga yoga and share my knowledge of all aspects of yoga, not just
   the physical practice.
   ABOUT PRIVATE YOGA

IS ASHTANGA YOGA FOR ME?

   Ashtanga yoga is suitable for everyone. It is a transformational tool
   for deep healing and may be beneficial for you if:


     * you have pain in your body or are recovering from an injury
     * you want to gain strength and flexibility
     * you are suffering with stress or anxiety
     * you want to transform your outlook on life and the world around you
     * you want to experience mystical states and connect with a higher
       power
     *

   I look forward to supporting you on your Ashtanga yoga journey.

   Instagram post 2133612556745745718_251881666 Slow Sunday mornings ‚òïÔ∏èü•∞ .
   My friends over at @organicbasics gifted me some of their gorgeous new
   eco undies and I‚Äôm in love! Can I tell you more about them? . This
   fabric is made from wood pulp, woven into the softest of threads - it
   feels so luxurious on the skin. The production process is free from
   toxic chemicals, uses far less water and emits far less CO2 than
   conventional cotton (see their website for the full stats). They also
   work with trusted factories, certified to be free of forced or child
   labour. . I love discovering new ways to switch up my old, less
   eco-conscious habits for planet-positive ones but it can be a little
   overwhelming. My approach has just been to wait until I really need
   something new and then research the best eco options. Thanks
   @organicbasics for making my underwear switch a really easy decision! .
   They will definitely cost you more up front than a 5 pack of knickers
   from H&M but they will last you much longer AND they are kinder to the
   planet... so if you have the means, I really recommend giving them a
   try üëçüèº . Oh, and use my code for 10% off! NATHOB3 . #organicbasics

   Instagram post 2131241131850373809_251881666 Last week I wrote to
   everyone on my email list to see if they had any burning questions for
   #GregorMaehle . I chose 5 of my favourites and asked him over dinner on
   our last night! I‚Äôm sharing the answers with my email fam today so if
   you‚Äôd like to read them make sure you sign up now (link in my bio).
   Here are the questions we asked: . 1Ô∏è‚É£How do you get over fear of
   #inversions ? . 2Ô∏è‚É£When are you going to write a biography of your
   fascinating (and scandalous) life stories?! . 3Ô∏è‚É£As a newly budding
   yogi, what's the one thing you wish your teachers had taught you? .
   4Ô∏è‚É£Why does the #pranayama you teach differ from the sequence Pattabhi
   Jois taught his students when he was alive? . 5Ô∏è‚É£What does your daily
   practice routine look like? . Sign up now to receive the answers in
   your inbox! As you might recall from my spam (sorry) I loved this
   retreat <3 It is so fab as a young teacher to be able to learn from
   Gregor as he is adjusting asanas. But he also teaches me how to assess
   everyone‚Äôs pranayama technique as well. Having 30 bodies in a room to
   study and assist is really a dream come true! Feeling so lucky and
   inspired to help others learn these life changing practices üíì .
