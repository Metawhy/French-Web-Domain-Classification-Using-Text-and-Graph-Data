Hello + Update

   Leave a reply

   Hello to my friends!

   I’ve taken a bit of a blogging break to focus on my family. As moms,
   it’s always the never-ending struggle to manage priorities and to keep
   our focus in the right place. The kiddos are growing faster than I
   would like, but what a joyous time! I’ve managed to catch up on your
   sweet comments and feeling super loved and blessed!

   I have some very exciting news to share with you but I must wait just a
   couple more days… stay tuned, my friends!

   Shhhhhhh... I have a secret. I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Lots of Love,
   Mary

“O” is for Overwhelmed

   2 Replies


   Hello there, Friends!


   I’m in this stage of life right now: the small-children,
   everyday-seems-like-chaos, got-to-keep-my-head-above-water, stage of
   life. And it’s a struggle sometimes not to think of it in that way.

   "O" is for OVERWHELMED :: becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Because the truth is, I absolutely ADORE this stage of life and I
   wouldn’t trade it for the world–I was born for this! I love the dirty
   diapers (yes, you heard me). I take joy in changing my babies’ diapers!
   I love the tickles and giggles. And I love those sweet moments of
   correction when God has given me the grace to say the right things and
   direct their little steps closer to the Truth. But some days I just get
   so very overwhelmed with my “to-do” list as well as the daily stuff
   that seems to pile up even faster than I can even imagine how to keep
   up with. As I lie awake with my mind spinning and trying to come up
   with a plan-of-attack for the month to come, I’m reminded of this verse
   that quickly calms my spirit and brings me back home.

   Psalm 61:2 "from the end of the earth I call to you when my heart is
   faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I," I DailyBibleMeme.com

   Lots of love,
   Mary

The Clean Oven Door Solution – For Realz!

   2 Replies

   Hi Friends!

   You can go ahead and give me the title of “Worst Blogger Ever” since I
   disappear for weeks on end without notice… yet you’re still here,
   faithful and waiting. I have many things to share with you including
   photos from a lovely trip to Belgium and Paris. But for now, I MUST
   share with you this wealth of knowledge that recently fell into my lap!

   The clean oven door solution I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Have you ever spilled something between the glass of your oven door? I
   did! It all started a few months ago when I was quickly taking a bowl
   of oatmeal out of the microwave (which is above my oven). Whoops! Down
   it went, behind the microwave door and directly into the grated vent
   holes and between the impossible-to-get-to glass panes inside the oven
   door! Ugh! I immediately took to Pinterest in search of someone’s
   tutorial on how to possibly get in there to clean it out. I read many
   articles and crazy MacGyver tricks like sticking a rag in and using a
   hanger to move it around to completely disassembling the entire unit.
   Nothing worked for me! No matter how many screws I unscrewed, I could
   not get that darn oven door open! So I lived with a gross oven door for
   a while. Until…

   My friend and homemaking genius Eryn posted a funny photo on Facebook
   on how she got a rag stuck between her oven door glass in an attempt to
   clean it out (see MacGyver reference above). She had a service man come
   out to retrieve the rag for her and he showed her how easy it is to
   disassemble the oven door for future cleanings.

   She shared this wealth of info with me and I nearly fell over finding
   out how EASY it is to remove and disassemble my oven door! Well I
   couldn’t keep this knowledge to myself so here it is. Are you
   ready? The key is unlocking the door hinges so that you can lift the
   door off of the frame. See photos below showing step-by-step.

   This is what your hinge should look like now: The clean oven door
   solution I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Place fingers as shown as far back as possible:
   The clean oven door solution I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Pull upward as shown:
   The clean oven door solution I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Pull all the way back:
   The clean oven door solution I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   The clean oven door solution I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   This is what your unlocked hinge should look like:
   The clean oven door solution I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Once both sides are unlocked, place your oven door upright but not
   completely closed. Pull upward and out to remove the door from the
   frame (this is difficult and requires a little muscle). Once the door
   is removed, you should be able to access all the screws to disassemble
   the door and access all window panes for washing. I would advise to
   take photos as you go along so that you know how everything goes back
   together. Also, keep your screws in the same place as to not lose them.

   WARNING: Oven doors are very heavy! Remove with caution and solicit
   help if needed. Be extremely careful handling glass. Aside from the
   obvious risk of cutting yourself, this glass is very expensive to
   replace.

   Happy cleaning!

   Lots of love,
   Mary

Shoe Storage – Again!

   1 Reply

   Some of you may remember the cute little shoe bench that I painted a
   while back for the kids. And more recently the custom shoe cabinet that
   I just updated. Well, here we are again addressing the ever popular
   shoe dilemma, luckily Nicershoes made a list to help me get organized,
   since we have outgrown the shoe bench. Most of the time it’s
   overflowing and we’ve been found many times digging for that matching
   pair of shoes during crunch time when we’re trying to get out the door!

   With four little kiddos now (meaning four different shoe sizes to sort
   through), I needed a place to separate them for each child, but still
   keep them downstairs and easily accessible. My solution this time
   around is the simple plastic basket.

   Shoe organization I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   I found the baskets at Target for $5 a piece. (Smaller versions of this
   same basket can be found at the Dollar Tree for only $1 a piece.) This
   system works for us right now!  The girls know which basket is theirs
   and they also know how to put away and sort the shoes — a huge
   time-saver!

   Shoe Organization // becauseiliketodecorate.com

   The baskets fit in the closet nicely and it’s been much easier to keep
   the shoes contained now!

   Fun fact: Gabby (2nd Child) has twice as many shoes as everyone else. I
   was thinking why that was the case and then it totally made sense:
   first, she gets all the hand-me-downs. And then because she gets so
   many hand-me-downs, I feel guilty and buy her new shoes, too! #spoiled
   #notabrat

   Lots of love,
   Mary

My First Canvas Painting!

   1 Reply

   DIY to a whole new level! Have you ever dreamt of being an artist? Like
   a real one… that you’ve see in the movies? You know the picture. A
   blank canvas in front of you. Music playing in the background. Nothing
   but you and your paintbrush with a beautiful mountain or beachside view
   for inspiration. You’re wearing a beret–okay, maybe I’m taking it a
   little too far!

   My surroundings were a bit different than in my dreams. Adi was at
   school and the boys were down for a nap at the same time — it’s my
   chance! My three-year-old, Gabby, wanted to paint “like mommy.” So I
   set her up on the kitchen island with newspapers and a scrap piece of
   wood. Nick Jr. on in the background to keep her doubly entertained in
   hopes that I could create a two-hour window to pull off a painting. It
   worked save a few trips to refill Gabby with snacks and more paint
   colors. Gabby had a great time too! *wink*

   Tah-dah!
   Turn an old throw away canvas into your own custom art! //
   becauseiliketodecorate.com

   I went for a kind of pop-art style and copied a photograph of my oldest
   girl, Adi. Yes, she’s only five-years-old. I’m thinking this is a
   vision of her much older… or I’m just not a very good painter. Probably
   the latter! Anyway, I had a ton of fun and can’t wait to paint more
   pieces!

   becauseiliketodecorate.com

   My favorite part of the painting is the lips! And it’s hard to see in
   photographs, but the gold has an amazing sheen to it when the light
   hits the canvas.

   Sometimes I look at it and I’m super critical — so many things to tweak
   and fix. And other times, it catches my eye and I just love the depth
   of the colors and textures.

   From an old canvas to new custom art. DIY project. //

   Question: do you think I should add a caption to the photo?  She has a
   curious look on her face and I thought it may look good to add a
   caption bubble, but haven’t thought of anything good enough to make
   permanent. Any ideas?

   Lots of love,
   Mary

Dumpster Divin’

   3 Replies

   I’ve reached a new low… dumpster diving! Okay, okay… before you get all
   grossed out, let me explain. We have new construction in our
   neighborhood, which means construction dumpsters everywhere! And I must
   confess that I may have taken a scrap piece of wood or two that was
   sticking out of the top, and maybe a wooden pallet as well — of which
   many are thrown out almost daily. It’s tempting not to go around and
   collect things, but then my house would become a dumpster. And since I
   just had a garage sale and got rid of a lot of stuff, I must refrain.
   Anywho, let me get back on track.

   Have you ever missed trash day? Ugh! Don’t you hate it?! Well, one of
   the benefits of having new construction in your neighborhood is that
   big dumpsters make it super easy to purge your trash when you miss
   trash day. One evening when we were “dumping” our trash
   (shhhhhhhhh…don’t tell!), I saw that someone else had the same idea and
   I found this huge canvas (see picture below) leaning against the
   dumpster! I know what you’re thinking: “WHO WOULD WANT THAT?!” I know
   it’s dated and shall we say “not my favorite.” (That’s what we tell the
   kids to say when they don’t like something *wink*.)
   Transform an old canvas to new! I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Transform an old canvas to new! I becauseiliketodecorate.com

   Well, it’s a 40″ x 50″ canvas and those can get pretty pricey when you
   buy them brand-new. I’ve always wanted to play “artist,” so why not
   paint over an old canvas piece and make it my own? After all, it’s not
   going to cost me anything. So we took it home!

   Stay tuned for the BIG reveal. It may or may not be considered “good”
   art, but I’m giving myself an “A” for effort!

   Lots of love,
   Mary
