Cats from Sainte-Preuve {France}

   château de barive
   In Sainte-Preuve, in the heart of the French Champagne region, is a
   four-star hotel called Château de Barive or Domaine de Barive.
   Less than two hours from Paris, many tourists stay at the Château de
   Barive to enjoy its gorgeous interiors and spa, or to try the
   restaurant's renowned meat and fish dishes.
   But the best part... These two cats will welcome you as you enter the
   domain.

  Cats from Tangier {Morocco}

   on Wednesday, September 11, 2019

   tangier morocco
   When you visit Morocco, especially Moroccan Medinas (cities downtown),
   you notice cats in every street corner. In some cities like
   Chefchaouen, Tangier and Marrakech, cats are really everywhere and part
   of Moroccan streets and everyday life. You see them sleeping, playing,
   eating and sunbathing in unusual places.
   white cat tangier
   Moroccan cats photography has become one of my favorite kinds of
   photography. These cats are so special, charming and have their own
   character. I have pictures of cats I took years ago, and I can still
   remember when, where and how the picture was taken.
   cats of tangier
   Fixing cats is not very common in Morocco, hence their high number.
   Although some of them have owners, the majority are wild cats and live
   on the streets. That's why I always travel with cat food. If you are
   visiting Morocco, take with you a small bag of croquettes and you'll
   enjoy feeding the poor cats. They can look happy, but despite locals
   and associations efforts, many of them are hungry and need help.

  Cats from Ubud {Bali}

   on Monday, September 02, 2019

   tegalang rice fields
   Meet ‘Christina Aguilera’ and her baby kitty. Both are Balinese locals
   at the classic Tegalalang Rice Fields on the gorgeous island of Bali.
   tegalang rice fields cats
   Baby kitty loved the snuggles, and mama Christina was busy napping (I
   don’t blame her. Look how peaceful the spot).
   Make sure to give them a visit on your vacation to the island. They are
   up high with their daddy, a local rice farmer who plays the xylophone
   up in the terraces.

  Cat from Leiden {Netherlands}

   on Monday, August 19, 2019

   begraafplaats groenesteeg leiden
   Your first stop when visiting Leiden in the Netherlands should be
   Begraafplaats Groenesteeg. This 19th century cemetery not only makes
   for one of the area's prettiest walks in nature; it also has a
   four-legged gatekeeper: a cat.
   This pretty feline seems to be a fixture of Begraafplaats Groenesteeg.
   She loves rubbing herself against visitors' legs while following them
   around the cemetery. Once in a while, she sneaks away to chase after
   some geese.
   It looks like the graves are in good paws.

  Cat from London {England}

   on Sunday, August 04, 2019

   anglesea arms
   For a long time, Lily was a bit of a mystery cat. Although she can be
   found at the Anglesea Arms most days, she doesn't actually live there.
   But when live-in Australian deputy-manager Kathryn Wild comes down to
   get the pub ready for the day, somewhere around 11am, Lily will usually
   appear outside the window, peering in, patiently waiting for someone to
   open the front door for her. If Kathryn is not around, then the cleaner
   will usually oblige.
   london pub
   The elderly feline - who is predominantly white with patches of
   rusty-brown and black on her face, and a raccoon-like, bushy striped
   tail - will usually spend most of each day inside, curled up on the
   shelf of a mirrored, wood-panelled pillar facing the door or, in colder
   weather, sleeping on one of the big leather sofas beside the fire. She
   is such a fixture that she has her own food bowl, which gets filled
   twice a day. It sits below and to the left of her portrait, painted by
   local artist Jenny Abbott.

   relations

   As the pub doesn't open until 5pm Monday to Thursday, she's left
   undisturbed all afternoon.
   Later on, she grudgingly shares her domain with the paying customers.
   She used to get a little gnarly with anyone who disturbed her, but she
   has mellowed with age, says Kathryn. Then each evening, come closing
   time, she departs."She might be sleeping but I just have to say, 'Lily,
   it's time,' and she'll get up and leave straight away," says manager
   Chris Welburn.
   london catspotting
   The mystery was, where did she go? That was solved when a customer came
   in and identified Lily as her cat. She lives locally, although she
   spends far more time at the pub than at home. When her owner comes in,
   Lily always acts as though she doesn't know her.

   Despard has a fanbase that extends far beyond the north London pub
   anglesea arms cat
   It is a very cat-friendly neighborhood. The Anglesea is within what
   estate agents call Brackenbury Village, a network of pretty terraced
   streets lined with affluent homes, boutiquey shops and not much
   traffic. The pub itself is a handsome place, particularly following a
   four-month refurb in 2014 when the place was taken over by new owners
   George and Richard Manners. Predating their arrival, the pub had a
   solid reputation as one of London's original gastropubs, and it still
   has an excellent kitchen serving lunch Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
   dinner seven nights a week.
   The Manners brothers own six independent pubs across south-west London,
   each with its own character. There is one thing they all have in
   common: like the Anglesea, the Cumberland Arms and Dartmouth Castle,
   both in Hammersmith, the Swan in Chiswick, Atlas in Fulham, and Fox &
   Hounds on Latchmere Road in Battersea all have cats. Not all of them
   are as comfortable around people as Lily and some keep to the staff
   quarters upstairs, never venturing into the bar.
   ravenscourt park pub
   No one knows for sure how old Lily is, though Kathryn suspects she's
   "getting on" because she sometimes has difficulty seeing her food.
   "We now have to rattle her bowl to let her know where it is," says
   Kathryn.
   Lily still, however, maintains her peculiar habit of flipping the
   biscuits out of her bowl, one by one, before eating them.
   Read next => At Camden's Old Eagle, it's a cat that is the center of

   do cats love prawns
   What she really loves, though, are prawns.
   She has in the past leapt onto a customer's table and attempted to
   swipe the crustaceans.
   She isn't allowed in the dining room, a rule that she respects, but
   people can order food to eat in the bar and regulars sometimes buy her
   a half-pint glass of prawns of her own.
   That can get a bit messy as Lily prefers that you peel the prawns for
   her.
   can cats eat prawns
   Brisbane-native Kathryn, who started at the pub at the end of 2014,
   says it's partly Lily's fault she's still in the UK: "The plan had been
   to work the summer and then go traveling, but I grew too attached to
   Lily," she confesses. "I've just moved in upstairs and my plan is now
   to entice Lily up there to join me, permanently."

  Cats from Westende {Belgium}

   on Tuesday, July 16, 2019

   westende belgium
   Have you read the terrifying suspense book The Strangers Outside?
   If you have, you may be familiar with the location featured in these
   photos.
   In The Strangers Outside, two families go on vacation to a resort at
   the Belgian seaside village Westende. But little do they know they're
   being surrounded. Shortly after their arrival, they come face to face
   with 'the strangers outside.' When the assailants make their intentions
   known, things take a shockingly terrible turn, and an intense battle
   for survival will begin.
   westende jagerspad
   The cats on these photos live near the vacation rental where the
   story's main characters are staying and being slaughtered.
   zwerfkatten middelkerke
   To quote the book: “It was a massive complex of independent structures,
   each connected by meandering pathways. Louise’s grandmother called the
   brown houses with low flat ceilings 'military bunkers.' Even the long,
   narrow gardens looked alike. Ugly or not, they conveyed a sense of
   security, warmth, and safety.”
   westende katten
   The house where these cats live, although it's located outside of the
   complex, is featured in the book as well.
   At a certain point, a character named Claire manages to escape from the
   masked strangers and runs out of the domain and toward the only house
   that is showing some light. From behind the window, she sees a senior
   couple watching a game show on television from the comfort of their
   soft leather futon. She pounds the door and rings the doorbell, but
   despite Claire's effort to get their attention, the couple doesn't hear
   her. Meanwhile, the masked figures are approaching fast.
   zwerfkatjes middelkerke
   Westende is a lot more peaceful than in the novel, though, so the cats
   are safe. In fact, they seemed to be rather spoiled, so no need to
   worry.
   westende zwerfkatten
   Do you want to see these cats yourself?
   They live in a street named Jagerspad in Westende. The main resort from
   the novel is located in the Heidestraat, just in front.
