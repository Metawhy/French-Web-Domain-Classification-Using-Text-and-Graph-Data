   Sir Elton John today confirmed he had paid for the Duke and Duchess of
   Sussex to fly to and from his £15million mansion in Nice by private jet
   for a holiday 'inside the safety and tranquillity of our home'.

   The 72-year-old singer claimed he had ensured Prince Harry and Meghan's
   flight to and from the French Riviera last week were carbon neutral by
   making the 'appropriate contribution' to a carbon footprint fund.

   His intervention comes after the royal couple found themselves
   embroiled in another hypocrisy row today after being pictured leaving
   the south of France on Saturday in a fourth trip by private jet in just
   11 days.

How Harry and Meghan’s huge seven-ton carbon footprint could cost just £170
to offset

   Harry and Meghan's trip to Nice was estimated to have had a carbon
   footprint of just over three tons.

   The private jet generated an estimated seven times the emissions per
   person compared to a commercial flight, on which even a business class
   seat would be more carbon efficient.

   This was on top of their Ibiza trip this month which was believed to
   have had a footprint of more than four tons.

   Daren Howarth, the founder of C-Level, another carbon
   offsetting organisation, told the Telegraph that the figure might be
   closer to 12 tonnes for the Nice trip alone.

   He estimated that each passenger on a private jet emits 0.6 tons of
   CO2 for each hour flown and therefore the four-hour return flight works
   out at 2.4 tons of CO2 per passenger.

   He calculated, on the basis of five people flying in the jet, a total
   of 12 tonnes of CO2, which would cost just £168 to offset.

   Sir Elton did not vouchsafe how much he contributed to Carbon
   Footprint.

    Harry and Meghan, who have been outspoken on environmental issues in
   recent months, generated an estimated seven times the emissions per
   person compared to a commercial flight when flying home from Nice.

   Photographs of the royal couple and three-month-old Archie showed the
   family stepping on board the Cessna 680 Citation Sovereign jet on
   Saturday at about 3pm local time, having arrived in France three days
   earlier.

   Royal experts said the British public do not want to be 'lectured on
   climate change by those who don't do follow their own advice', while
   MPs said the trips do not 'fit with their public image' they project as
   eco-warriors.

   The couple visited the £15million palatial home of Castel Mont-Alban
   owned by Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish overlooking the
   Promenade des Anglais during their holiday to the French Riviera.

   The trip to Nice came shortly after Harry and Meghan, who married in
   May last year, had returned by private jet to the UK from Ibiza after a
   six-night break on the Spanish island to mark the Duchess's 38th
   birthday.

   Meanwhile, also this afternoon, the Duke and Duchess sparked fury among
   some of their followers on Instagram by posting a quote from Archbishop
   Desmond Tutu about doing 'your little bit of good'.

   The quote read: 'Do your little bit of good where you are; it's those
   little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world.' But one of
   their followers said: 'How about less gaz guzzling air travel?'

Off-setting scheme supported by Elton John ‘will have no meaningful effect on
climate change’

   Greenpeace's chief scientist has said it is 'not okay' to claim that
   private jet travel is 'carbon neutral' as a result of a donation to a
   carbon offset scheme.

   Sr Doug Parr told MailOnline: 'There's no way any current tech deals
   with the load of CO2 you've released on a personal level'.

   Sir Elton John responded to criticism of Harry and Meghan's recent
   private jet vacations by insisting he had made a donation to offset the
   carbon cost of the trips.

   The royal couple's return flights in private jets from England to
   Ibiza, and then from England to Nice, generated an estimated seven
   tonnes of CO2.

   Sir Elton wrote: 'To support Prince Harry's commitment to the
   environment, we ensured their flight was carbon neutral, by making the
   appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint™.'

   Carbon Footprint is a UK registered company run by John and Wendy
   Buckley, which provides advice to individuals and businesses on how to
   reduce their carbon footprint, and channels funding to schemes designed
   to offset carbon emissions.

   These projects include the planting of trees or the reduction of
   Brazilian deforestation.

   According to Carbon Positive Life a single tree can absorb as much as
   48 lbs (21.77 kgs) of CO2 per year, meaning it would take 321 years to
   absorb seven tonnes, although it could cost as little as £170 to
   offset.

   However in common with many carbon offset firms, many of the schemes
   run by Carbon Footprint focus on other ways to put in place systems,
   especially in developing countries, which stop carbon dioxide - which
   would otherwise have been released into the atmosphere - from being
   released.

   One scheme is focused on identifying and repairing broken boreholes in
   Uganda - so local communities get access to safe drinking water and, as
   a result, do not have to cut trees and burn firewood to boil and purify
   their drinking water in future.

   Another scheme distributes efficient cooking stoves to villagers in
   Kenya, where more than 80 per cent of the population relies on burning
   wood and charcoal to cook, producing a large amount of CO2.

   Carbon Footprint believes that scheme has helped more than 96,000
   people, prevented deforestation, provided protection from lung cancer
   and reduced global CO2 emission by 17,970 tonnes of CO2 per year in
   comparison to where those levels would otherwise be.

   Dr Parr said of the projects funded by the firm to which Sir Elton
   donated: 'They're not wrong things to be done, but they're not the
   answer that's meaningful in terms of the climate challenge we face.'

   Another said: 'Time to 'reign' in your gas guzzling, hippocratic [sic]
   ways! You personally are destroying our planet more than any of the
   average citizens. Don't you dare ever preach to us again about climate
   change.'

   Last Wednesday, Harry and Meghan had arrived in France on a 12-seater
   Cessna aircraft, despite there being more than 20 scheduled commercial
   flights from London to Nice each Wednesday costing as little as £100
   each.

   The Cessna plane would have cost more than £20,000 to hire, meaning
   Harry and Meghan could have taken 200 flights to Nice for the same
   price.

   The visit to France came after their first Mediterranean holiday of the
   summer - a trip to Ibiza which saw them fly out on August 6 before
   returning last Monday. Both journeys were again made by private jet.

   Veteran royal watcher Phil Dampier told MailOnline today: 'Whether you
   think recent criticism of Harry and Meghan is fair or not it's worrying
   to me that they don't seem to care and aren't about to change their
   behaviour.

   'They must have known that taking private jets four times in quick
   succession would leave them open to charges of hypocrisy but they just
   went ahead and did it anyway.

   'They are not unique - other royals have taken private jets, but they
   have been criticised over the years as well. I certainly don't believe
   they are getting a bad press because the British public are racist.

   'It is simply that people don't like to be lectured on climate change
   by those who don't do follow their own advice.'

   The author of 'Royally Suited: Harry and Meghan In Their Own Words'
   added: 'Some families slave away all year to afford one nice holiday
   and they shouldn't be made to feel guilty about harming the planet when
   Harry and Meghan are swanning about in luxury.'

   Meanwhile Paul Morozzo, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, told
   MailOnline: 'An airliner is over ten times as polluting as a modern
   train, and private jets are ten times more polluting still.

   'It's vitally important that all frequent fliers reduce the number of
   flights they take if we are to confront the climate emergency, and that
   means the last thing we should be doing is building new runways
   anywhere in the UK.'

   Labour MP Teresa Pearce said: 'Given the position they have taken
   publicly about being responsible on climate change, this does seem an
   anomaly which they should look at.

   'I find this quite surprising because it doesn't fit with their public
   image and the way they're so concerned about the planet and the
   environment.'

   Ken Wharfe, an ex-royal protection officer who guarded Princess Diana,
   said: 'Frankly it's hypocritical. Harry can't be preaching about the
   catastrophic effects of climate change while jetting around the world
   on a private plane.'

   Kensington Palace declined to comment on Harry and Meghan's trip when
   contacted by MailOnline today.

   Friends of the Earth climate change campaigner Aaron Kiely said last
   week: 'The Duke of Sussex speaks wonderful and stirring words on the
   environment and then he flies off on holiday to a European destination
   in a private jet.

PHIL DAMPIER: 'People don't like to be lectured on climate change by those
who don't do follow their own advice'

   'Whether you think recent criticism of Harry and Meghan is fair or not
   it's worrying to me that they don't seem to care and aren't about to
   change their behaviour.

   'They must have known that taking private jets three times in quick

   and Meghan are swanning about in luxury.

   'It's really sad to see all the goodwill that people had towards this
   couple disappear in such a short space of time.

   'They really need to understand quickly the damage they are doing and
   take steps to turn it around.

   'They could start by taking on some of the 1500 patronages of the Queen
   and Prince Philip, and get out there and do some run-of-the-mill royal
   jobs and shake a few hands.

   'Meghan gives the impression she wants to live like a Hollywood star
   protected by publicists, agents and lawyers and that's not how the
   royal family works.

   'It only survives because there is give and take and the public- who
   are paying for it - want it to succeed.

   'If they lose the public's support they are in trouble.'

   Phil Dampier is a veteran royal watcher and the author of Royally
   Suited: Harry and Meghan In Their Own Word

   'He could have taken a train and then a boat. This would have been the
   perfect opportunity to set an environmental example.'

   On August 6, the first day of the holiday to Ibiza, the only private
   plane travelling to Ibiza from Farnborough Airport was a Gulfstream
   200, which can hold up to 19 people.

   It left at 7.49am UK time and touched down on the Balearic island at
   10.49am local time.

   Six days later, on Monday of last week, a nine-seater Cessna 500
   XL, owned by NetJets, left Ibiza at 10.14am local time and landed at
   Farnborough at 11.20am UK time and is understood to have been carrying
   the royals.

   At least one leg of the journey is understood to have been booked
   through NetJets, which has earned the nicknames 'Hertz For Heirs' or
   'Uber for billionaires' because it serves the wealthy.

   It is not known who paid for the flights, which would have cost around
   £20,000 return. But NetJets are linked to Harry's close friend Nacho
   Figueras, an Argentine sportsman known as the 'David Beckham of polo'.

   Mr Figeuras is understood to own one of the jets and often uses his
   social media profiles to promote them. It is also possible they may
   have borrowed a private jet from a friend whose plane is managed by a
   hire company.

   NetJets has 750 planes for hire worldwide and boasts of offering an
   'unmatched experience' to rich clients.

   Once in Ibiza, the couple stayed in the Vista Alegre gated complex of
   sea-facing mansions and were guarded by British and Spanish state
   security personnel.

   There was also anger at the lack of transparency surrounding the trip,
   with royal representatives refusing to disclose how much it cost
   taxpayers.

   A source on the island told MailOnline the royals landed in Ibiza on
   August 6 with several taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police bodyguards.

   They added that five close protection officers from the Spanish
   security forces joined the group escorting them to their private villa.

   The most expensive villas overlooking the azure waters of Ibiza's
   Porroig Bay are listed at £20,000 per week, but the price of others on
   enquiry rises to £120,000 per week, reported the Sun.

   Buckingham Palace claimed that it was a private matter and declined to
   comment.

   Harry and Meghan's trip to France was estimated to have had a carbon
   footprint of just over three tons and their earlier trip to Ibiza was
   believed to have had a footprint of more than four tons. The carbon
   footprint of an average person in the UK is 13 tons a year.

   Meanwhile, it was reported last week that Harry and Meghan asked the
   Queen if they could live in Windsor Castle when they were planning
   their life together.

   She was said to have politely, but firmly, suggested that they move to
   Frogmore Cottage instead.

   The couple's decision to use a private jet for their Ibiza trip means
   the journey would have emitted six times more carbon dioxide per person
   than a scheduled flight from London to the Spanish island.

   The flights there and back would have given out 12.5 tons of carbon
   dioxide. There are around 14 scheduled flights from London and the
   South East to Ibiza each day.

Sir Elton John's full post on Instagram defending the Duke and Duchess

   'I am deeply distressed by today's distorted and malicious account in
   the press surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's private stay at
   my home in Nice last week.

   'Prince Harry's Mother, Diana Princess of Wales was one of my dearest
   friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his
   family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana's
   untimely death.

   'After a hectic year continuing their hard work and dedication to
   charity, David and I wanted the young family to have a private holiday
   inside the safety and tranquillity of our home.

   'To maintain a high level of much-needed protection, we provided them
   with a private jet flight. To support Prince Harry's commitment to the
   environment, we ensured their flight was carbon neutral, by making the
   appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint™.

   'I highly respect and applaud both Harry and Meghan's commitment to
   charity and I'm calling on the press to cease these relentless and
   untrue assassinations on their character that are spuriously crafted on
   an almost daily basis.'

   Their choice of transport flew in the face of their frequent public
   pronouncements on green issues.

   In an interview published in the September issue of Vogue with
   conservationist Jane Goodall, Harry revealed that he and Meghan wanted
   a 'maximum' of two children because of environmental concerns.

   The issue was guest-edited by the Duchess and she chose climate change
   activist Greta Thunberg as one of her 'forces for change' to be put on
   the front cover.

   Greta, 16, travelled to New York from England by boat because she
   refuses to travel by plane.

   The couple's string of private-jet flights also comes after Harry
   attended a 'green summit' organised by tech giant Google in Sicily at
   the end of July where he delivered an impassioned speech on saving the
   environment.

   He was reportedly barefoot as he gave his lecture to VIPs and
   power-brokers. However, it was claimed Google paid for his flights and
   a helicopter to a luxury resort where he is said to have stayed on a
   gas-guzzling super-yacht.

   Other Royals have used cheap airlines for their flights alongside the
   public. Prince Harry boarded a Wizz Air flight from Luton to
   Transylvania in 2012 and in 2015 Prince William, 37, used a Ryanair
   plane to get to Scotland.

   In 2011 he was also joined by wife Kate, also 37, on a Flybe flight to
   Zara and Mike Tindall's wedding.

   It's a palatial property fit for royals - and certainly lived up to the
   billing when Sir Elton John hosted the Duke and Duchess of Sussex at
   his £15million residence last week.

   The 72-year-old singer often spends the summer months at his home of
   Castel Mont-Alban overlooking Nice on the French Riviera with his
   husband David Furnish and their two sons Zachary, eight, and Elijah,
   six.

   Sir Elton has previously hosted the likes of David and Victoria
   Beckham, comedian David Walliams and actor couple Neil Patrick Harris
   and David Burtka at the property which was once dubbed his 'Pink

   He bought the Belle Epoque villa surrounded by the green spaces of Mont
   Boron in the 1990s and locals have described it as the 'Bel Air of
   Nice' thanks to the concentration of multimillion-pound mansions in the
   area.

   It can be seen from the Promenade des Anglais below, and local interior
   designer Bjarni Breidfjord said: 'It's quite unique for a celebrity
   like him to have bought here. No other celebrities live up there. He is
   king of that hill.'

   Sir Elton is known to enjoy staying in the exclusive area of France's
   Côte d'Azur and received the Legion d'Honneur, the country's highest
   civilian award, from President Emmanuel Macron just two months ago.

   Burtka previously said: 'Elton is a little more uptight in his real
   world, but in Nice he just relaxes. He's so fun and he laughs with his
   kids and has a good time. He just forgets about the madness of his
   life.'

   Sir Elton's home is just a 20-mile drive away from Cannes, where the
   annual film festival is held, and he is said to enjoy tending to his
   plants in the garden of the property, according to the Hollywood
   Reporter.

   The property was built in the 1920s and adapted by Sir Elton with
   designers Fred Dilger and Monique Gibson. The pool now features
   Egyptian Deco statues of the four seasons, while his bedroom has an
   Andy Warhol panting.

   Ms Gibson previously told Architectural Digest: 'It was pink for a
   while, then we painted it yellow. That's very much Elton's spirit:
   'I've enjoyed it pink; let's love it yellow.' Everything is always
   changing.'

   The home is also said to feature a tower room overlooking the
   Mediterranean, a metal mask sculpture by Roy Lichtenstein and
   slipcovers for the chairs with co-ordinate with 14 sets of china.

   Sir Elton is one of many celebrities who enjoy Nice as a playground of
   the rich – with others including actress Dame Joan Collins, U2 frontman
   Bono, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, actor Sean Connery and singer Tina
   Turner.

   The singer entered into a civil partnership with Canadian filmmaker Mr
   Furnish, 56, in December 2005, before tying the knot when same-sex
   marriage became legal in England and Wales in March 2014.

   How Princess Diana's pal Elton John became a confidante of her son
   Prince Harry and surprised guests at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's
   wedding with a rendition of Circle Of Life

   Sir Elton John's revelation today that he paid for Harry and Meghan's
   private jet holiday and that the royal couple stayed in his mansion in
   Nice is only the latest chapter of the story of Elton's life in royal
   circles.

   Over the years the Rocket Man singer has danced with the Queen, sung at
   royal weddings and funerals, and of course famously had a long and
   close friendship with Harry's mother Diana, which he referenced in his
   Instagram post today.

   Since the 1970s Elton John has been friends with the royals with both
   Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother being big fans of his music. He
   attended art events with Margaret and was a regular at Charles' Prince
   Trust annual concerts.

   And then at a lavish party in Windsor in 1981 for Prince Andrew's
   wedding, as he told a biographer: 'When I arrived, there was no one
   there but the dance band and Princess Diana. We danced the Charleston
   alone on the floor for 20 minutes.

   'Then Princess Anne came up to me and said, 'Would you like to dance?'
   What am I going to say — 'No, f- off?'

   The singer went on: 'As we're bobbing up and down, the Queen comes up
   with an equerry and says, 'Do you mind if we join you?' Just at that
   moment, the music segues into Bill Haley's 'Rock Around the Clock.' So
   I'm dancing to 'Rock Around the Clock' with the Queen of England.'

   After the party his friendship with Diana grew and he first met a young
   Prince Harry at a private lunch at Kensington Palace, given by his
   mother Princess Diana for Gianni Versace and Elton in the 1990s.

   The pair had a royal falling out subsequent to the publication of the
   coffee table book he co-created with Gianni Versace, Rock and Royalty.

   Pictures of members of the royal family, including one of the Princess
   and the boys, appeared amid a portfolio of semi-nude male models, and
   Diana feared that would upset the Queen. Royalties from the book
   benefited John's Aids foundation.

   But the pair reconciled after Versace's assassination. In July of 1997
   the designer was shot and killed in front of his Miami Beach home and
   the following week Diana comforted their mutual friend Elton at
   Versace's funeral.

   Later that same summer, Diana herself had died, in a car crash in a
   Parisian tunnel which shocked the world.

   Elton rewrote his Marilyn Monroe-inspired classic Candle In The Wind in
   honour of his friends, and Candle In the Wind 97, or Goodbye England's
   Rose shot to number 1 and won Elton a Grammy, raising millions for
   charity.

   He sang it at the funeral, telling the Telegraph: 'What was going
   through my mind was 'Don't sing a wrong note. Be stoic. Don't break
   down and just do it to the best you can possibly do it without showing
   any emotion whatsoever'

   'My heart was beating quite a lot, I have to say.'

   Two years ago Sir Elton led the tributes tributes to the Princess of
   Wales by posting a picture on Instagram of the pair together, with his
   arm around the Princess writing: '20 years ago today, the world lost an
   angel. RIP.'

   The star famously performed an alternative version of his poignant song
   Candle In The Wind in honour of Diana at her 1997 funeral, held just
   days after she was killed in a Paris car crash.

   Prince Harry later revealed that the song touched him on the day,
   telling a BBC documentary: 'Elton John's song was incredibly emotional,
   that was part of this whole trigger system which nearly brought me to
   the point of crying in public, which I'm glad I didn't do.'

   the royal couple a "high level of much-needed protection'

   He and David Furnish attended William and Kate's wedding despite only
   having met the couple a handful of times and last year he performed at
   the lunchtime reception for guests celebrating the wedding of Prince
   Harry and Meghan Markle.

   Prince Harry asked Sir Elton to perform at the reception which was
   hosted by Her Majesty The Queen at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle.

   The pop icon sang Circle of Life - made famous by the 1994 Disney film
   The Lion King - and Tiny Dancer.

   And last year the singer collaborated with the Duke of Sussex again.
   Attending the International AIDS Conference together for at least the
   second time, this time in Amsterdam, the two announced a new effort to
   continue their fight against AIDS.

   The pair launched the MenStar Coalition, an initiative aimed at
   targeting and preventing HIV infections in men, Harry said in his
   speech announcing MenStar on Tuesday.

   'I am honored to be sharing the stage with someone who has always put
   people at the center of his work, Sir Elton John,' Harry said. 'For
   over a quarter-century, Elton has worked tirelessly to fund research
   and services in communities around the world.'
