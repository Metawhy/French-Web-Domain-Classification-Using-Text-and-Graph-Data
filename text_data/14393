Programmers solve MIT’s 20-year-old cryptographic puzzle

Written By

   Adam Conner-Simons, MIT CSAIL
   Bernard Fabrot

   This week MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
   (CSAIL) announced that a 20-year-old cryptographic puzzle was just
   solved by a self-taught programmer from Belgium, 15 years earlier than
   MIT scientists expected.

   Bernard Fabrot spent the last three and a half years computing the
   solution to a puzzle first announced by MIT researchers in 1999.
   Separately, another team led by tech executive Simon Peffers is nearing
   completion of computing a solution.

   The puzzle essentially involves doing roughly 80 trillion successive
   squarings of a starting number, and was specifically designed to foil
   anyone trying to solve it more quickly by using parallel computing.

   Fabrot and Peffers took very different approaches to the puzzle. Fabrot
   used a simple Intel Core i7-6700 found in consumer PCs, and computed
   the solution using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP).
   Meanwhile, Peffers' team used a novel squaring algorithm (designed by
   Erdinç Öztürk from Sabanci University) to run on a programmable
   hardware accelerator called an FPGA. The team, which is working as part
   of a collaboration called Cryptophage, is on track to finish the puzzle
   on May 11 after only two months of computation.

   “There have been hardware and software advances beyond what I predicted
   in 1999,” says MIT professor Ron Rivest, who first announced the puzzle
   in April 1999 tied to a celebration of 35 years of research at MIT’s
   Laboratory for Computer Science (now CSAIL). “The puzzle’s fundamental
   challenge of doing roughly 80 trillion squarings remains unbroken, but
   the resources required to do a single squaring have been reduced by
   much more than I predicted.”

   The puzzle is an example of a “verifiable delay function” (VDF),
   meaning that its answer can only be solved after a certain number of
   steps. Because VDFs can also be used to create unbiased randomness,
   they’ve been proposed as potential approaches to improve the security
   and scalability of blockchain systems like Ethereum and Filecoin.

   In the original announcement, LCS promised that, if a correct solution
   was uncovered, they would open a special “time capsule” designed by
   architect Frank Gehry and filled with historical artifacts from the
   likes of Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, Ethernet co-inventor Bob
   Metcalfe, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. (Gates donated the original
   Altair BASIC that represented Microsoft’s first-ever product, which
   they developed for MITS in 1975.)

   The capsule ceremony will happen Wednesday, May 15 at 4 p.m. at MIT’s
   Stata Center.

   As the original leader of the Computation Structures Group, Professor
   Dennis led the development of dataflow models of computation and novel
   principles of computer architecture inspired by dataflow models. He is
   currently engaged in research on functional programming principles and
   related principles of computer architecture, and is applying these
   concepts in the design of a novel advanced multiprocessor chip for
   general-purpose computing.

   Prof. Dennis received the 1984 Eckert-Mauchly Award for contributions
   to the field of computer architecture, and is a Fellow of the IEEE and
   of the ACM.
