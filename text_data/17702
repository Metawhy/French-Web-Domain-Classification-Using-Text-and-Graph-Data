   Posted on 07/21/201604/15/2019 by PowerReviews Team
   powerreviews best and brightest companies

   Ratings and reviews technology company recognized for dynamic, high
   performance culture and collaborative work environment for second year
   in a row

   July 21, 2016 – CHICAGO –  PowerReviews, a leading provider of ratings,
   reviews and question-and-answer technology to more than 1,000 global
   brands and retailers, has been named one of Chicago’s Best and
   Brightest Companies to Work For® by the National Association for
   Business Resources.

   Recognized for the second consecutive year, this honor proves
   PowerReviews’ continued commitment to cultivating a positive and
   fulfilling environment for its employees. The company attributes its
   success in attracting and retaining top talent to its high-performance
   culture centered around the values of transparency and accountability.

   “Reviews create transparency between consumers and the companies they
   do business with, and transparency drives accountability,” said Matt
   Moog, CEO of PowerReviews. “We put the same principles of transparency
   and accountability to work in our culture. Every employee is empowered
   to make a positive impact on our company, our customers and our
   community.”

   PowerReviews believes that employees won’t be professionally effective
   if they aren’t personally fulfilled. To foster a healthy work-life
   balance, PowerReviews offers benefits such as flexible paid time off
   and encourages all employees to join committees that enact change both
   within the company and the local community. In addition, PowerReviews’
   unique hiring philosophy has helped the company attract a team of
   diverse employees, opening the organization to a broader set of skills
   and life experiences.

   In the past two years, PowerReviews has seen explosive growth and hired
   more than 150 people to support its continued expansion. Throughout
   this rapid growth, PowerReviews remains committed to maintaining its
   employee-centric work environment.

   Nominees for the Best and Brightest award were evaluated by an
   independent research firm on employee selection, engagement,
   development and enrichment, retention, community initiatives and
   strategic company performance.

Meet the Team: Arend Henderson from Analytics

   Posted on 03/27/201702/07/2019 by PowerReviews Team
   PowerReviews office space featured image

   Meet the Team is a recurring series on the PowerReviews blog, allowing
   you to get to know the people behind our success.

   We recently sat down with Arend Henderson, our SVP, Analytics, to chat
   about how he likes to take risks and use his creative side – to improve
   a client’s understanding of how analytics can be used to improve
   business, and to improve a wicked barbecue sauce at a 4th of July
   party.

   arend

   With about 20 years in a leadership role in analytics at other firms,
   what brought you to PowerReviews?
   On one hand, I was working heavily in the advertising industry, and
   this allowed me a new and interesting challenge on the consumer side of
   things. On a higher level, my decision to come here was a combination
   of data, the people here, and the untapped potential that analytics
   presents for the customers here.

   Looking at report data can be overwhelming for non-technical folks.
   What do you love about it?
   It’s funny, compared to many others in my field, I fall more on the
   creative side of things. But those on the outside still see what I do
   as very technical. What we can do is very special – the data available
   from ratings and reviews can tell a retailer or brand what people think
   of their products, and even how they rank compared to the competition.
   This is information that industries spend a lot of time and money
   trying to obtain, and we can coax this all from the data. That’s
   exciting.

   How do you approach the practical benefits of analytics with your
   clients?
   I find that the basics cannot be underrated, and that the focus needs
   to be on the business questions, with an eye to continuously refining
   those questions. While some folks can be dazzled by a new technique, or
   want to see some sort of chart that shows them some aspect of data, I
   may challenge them by asking what they are looking to do with the data.
   Our goal here is to provide more insightful solutions, and not just
   necessarily respond to a specific request when we may have more to
   offer our clients.

   Do you find your clients utilize their reporting capabilities to their
   greatest advantage?
   We have some great products, but sometimes the most useful tools are
   already right there, built into the reporting. The core value is in the
   tracking of site behavior and conversion, combined with the ratings and
   review information. We’re always available to talk to our clients, to
   dig deeper in order to bring out the most beneficial data, including
   how to act upon what is discovered.

   How do you explore your creative side outside of the office?
   In my free time I like to relax with my wife and two sons. I especially
   enjoy photography, and making a fantastic barbecue for friends and
   neighbors. I love when I can try something new and get an unexpected,
   delicious result.

   powerreviews best and brightest companies

   Ratings and reviews technology company recognized for dynamic, high
   performance culture and collaborative work environment for second year
   in a row

   July 21, 2016 – CHICAGO –  PowerReviews, a leading provider of ratings,
   reviews and question-and-answer technology to more than 1,000 global
   brands and retailers, has been named one of Chicago’s Best and
   Brightest Companies to Work For® by the National Association for
   Business Resources.

   Recognized for the second consecutive year, this honor proves
   PowerReviews’ continued commitment to cultivating a positive and
   fulfilling environment for its employees. The company attributes its
   success in attracting and retaining top talent to its high-performance
   culture centered around the values of transparency and accountability.

   “Reviews create transparency between consumers and the companies they
   do business with, and transparency drives accountability,” said Matt
   Moog, CEO of PowerReviews. “We put the same principles of transparency
   and accountability to work in our culture. Every employee is empowered
   to make a positive impact on our company, our customers and our
   community.”

   PowerReviews believes that employees won’t be professionally effective
   if they aren’t personally fulfilled. To foster a healthy work-life
   balance, PowerReviews offers benefits such as flexible paid time off
   and encourages all employees to join committees that enact change both
   within the company and the local community. In addition, PowerReviews’
   unique hiring philosophy has helped the company attract a team of
   diverse employees, opening the organization to a broader set of skills
   and life experiences.

   In the past two years, PowerReviews has seen explosive growth and hired
   more than 150 people to support its continued expansion. Throughout
   this rapid growth, PowerReviews remains committed to maintaining its
   employee-centric work environment.

   Nominees for the Best and Brightest award were evaluated by an
   independent research firm on employee selection, engagement,
   development and enrichment, retention, community initiatives and
   strategic company performance.

Meet the Team: Arend Henderson from Analytics

   Posted on 03/27/201702/07/2019 by PowerReviews Team
   PowerReviews office space featured image

   Meet the Team is a recurring series on the PowerReviews blog, allowing
   you to get to know the people behind our success.

   We recently sat down with Arend Henderson, our SVP, Analytics, to chat
   about how he likes to take risks and use his creative side – to improve
   a client’s understanding of how analytics can be used to improve
   business, and to improve a wicked barbecue sauce at a 4th of July
   party.

   arend

   With about 20 years in a leadership role in analytics at other firms,
   what brought you to PowerReviews?
   On one hand, I was working heavily in the advertising industry, and
   this allowed me a new and interesting challenge on the consumer side of
   things. On a higher level, my decision to come here was a combination
   of data, the people here, and the untapped potential that analytics
   presents for the customers here.

   Looking at report data can be overwhelming for non-technical folks.
   What do you love about it?
   It’s funny, compared to many others in my field, I fall more on the
   creative side of things. But those on the outside still see what I do
   as very technical. What we can do is very special – the data available
   from ratings and reviews can tell a retailer or brand what people think
   of their products, and even how they rank compared to the competition.
   This is information that industries spend a lot of time and money
   trying to obtain, and we can coax this all from the data. That’s
   exciting.

   How do you approach the practical benefits of analytics with your
   clients?
   I find that the basics cannot be underrated, and that the focus needs
   to be on the business questions, with an eye to continuously refining
   those questions. While some folks can be dazzled by a new technique, or
   want to see some sort of chart that shows them some aspect of data, I
   may challenge them by asking what they are looking to do with the data.
   Our goal here is to provide more insightful solutions, and not just
   necessarily respond to a specific request when we may have more to
   offer our clients.

   Do you find your clients utilize their reporting capabilities to their
   greatest advantage?
   We have some great products, but sometimes the most useful tools are
   already right there, built into the reporting. The core value is in the
   tracking of site behavior and conversion, combined with the ratings and
   review information. We’re always available to talk to our clients, to
   dig deeper in order to bring out the most beneficial data, including
   how to act upon what is discovered.

   How do you explore your creative side outside of the office?
   In my free time I like to relax with my wife and two sons. I especially
   enjoy photography, and making a fantastic barbecue for friends and
   neighbors. I love when I can try something new and get an unexpected,
   delicious result.
