   Linux Journal Ceases Publication: An Awkward Goodbye

IMPORTANT NOTICE FROM LINUX JOURNAL, LLC:

On August 7, 2019, Linux Journal shut its doors for good. All staff were laid
off and the company is left with no operating funds to continue in any
capacity. The website will continue to stay up for the next few weeks,
hopefully longer for archival purposes if we can make it happen.

The Bash Trap Command

   Mitch Frazier - August 7, 2019
     If you've written any amount of bash code, you've likely come across
   the trap command. Trap allows you to catch signals and execute code
   when they occur. Signals are asynchronous notifications that are sent
   to your script when certain events occur. Most of these notifications
   are for events that you hope never happen, such as an invalid memory
   access or a bad system call. However, there are one or two events
   that you might reasonably want to deal with. There are also "user"
   events available that are never generated by the system that you can
   generate to signal your script. Bash also provides a psuedo-signal
   called "EXIT", which is executed when your script exits; this can be
   used to make sure that your script executes some cleanup on exit.

Simplifying Function Tracing for the Modern GCC

   Zack Brown - July 26, 2019
   Steven Rostedt wanted to do a little housekeeping, specifically with
   the function tracing code used in debugging the kernel. Up until then,
   the kernel could enable function tracing using either GCC's -pg flag or
   a combination of -pg and -mfentry. In each case, GCC would create a
   special routine that would execute at the start of each function, so
   the kernel could track calls to all functions.

What Does It Take to Make a Kernel?

   Petros Koutoupis - July 23, 2019
   The kernel this. The kernel that. People often refer to one operating
   system's kernel or another without truly knowing what it does or how it
   works or what it takes to make one. What does it take to write a custom
   (and non-Linux) kernel?

   …

   RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT
   Company shall take reasonable steps to accurately record the personal
   information that you provide to us and any subsequent updates. You are
   encouraged to review, update, and correct any personal information that
   we maintain about you, and you may request that we delete personal
   information about you that is inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant for
   legitimate purposes, or is processed in a manner that violates any
   applicable legal requirements for the handling of personal information,
   by contacting us as provided herein. You may request to review, edit,
   correct, or delete your personal information at any time by contacting
   our support team. Your right to review, update, correct, and delete
   your personal information may be limited, subject to the law or your
   jurisdiction: (i) where the rights or safety of another person or
   persons would be encroached upon, (ii) if the information or material
   you request relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings
   between you and us, or providing access to you would prejudice
   negotiations between us or an investigation of possible unlawful
   activity, or (iii) if your requests are abusive and/or unreasonably
   excessive. Your right to review, update, correct and delete your
   information is subject to our records retention policies and applicable
   federal and state data retention laws.

   RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
   Company shall retain your personal information while you as a data
   subject maintain an account with us and thereafter for as long as it is
   necessary for purposes not prohibited by applicable laws. Upon your
   request, the data controller will either delete your personal
   information or de-identify it so that it is anonymous and not
   attributed to your identity. Requests that we delete your personal
   information can be sent to our customer support team.

   LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING
   Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
   operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
   purpose. If the processing of personal information is necessary for the
   performance of a contract to which the information subject is party, as
   is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for
   the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is
   based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing
   operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual
   measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products
   or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which
   processing of personal information is required, such as for the
   fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)
   lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal information may
   be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of
   another natural person. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1)
   lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article
   6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations
   which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal grounds, if
   processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
   pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests
   are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of
   the data subject which require protection of personal information. Such
   processing operations are particularly permissible because they have
   been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered
   that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
   client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

   CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
   BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AS THE DATA
   SUBJECT CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOU AGREE THAT LINUXJOURNAL MAY
   MAKE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT ANY TIME WITHOUT ANY GIVEN
   NOTICE AT ITS DISCRETION.
