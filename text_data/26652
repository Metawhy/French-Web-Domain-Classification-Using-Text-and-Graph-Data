              Recipe for Calming Bath Salts with Essential Oils

   Materials Needed:
   This recipe makes approx. 26 (ounces)  = 3 jars (photo showed below)
   equivalent to that amount
   You can always put the bath salts into a muslin bag (100% cotton), or
   any other container with a lid.
     * 2 1/2 Cups of  Pure Epson Salt
     * 3 Tablespoons of Pink Himalayan Salt (you can use crystals as well)
     * 3 teaspoons of Fractionated Coconut Carrier Oil
     * 6 drops of geranium essential oil ( balance emotions, PMS,
       moisturizer)
     * 6 drops of lavender essential oil ( stress, anxiety, pains, burns )
     * 6 drops of rose essential oil ( wrinkles, scars, wounds, redness )
     * 6 drops of roman chamomile essential oil (dry & irritated skin)
     * 1/2 cup of mixed dried flowers ( mine included, lavender, roses,
       white flowers ) This is just what I had handy, I wish I had dried
       chamomile that would be perfect for this recipe)

   Mix all ingredients together & thats it!
   Simple, beautiful, makes a perfect gift. I made a total of six. Gave
   three of them away to my neighbors and my mom already. I'm excited to
   make more!
   Emotional Balance Notes:
   Geranium - Strengthening, Releasing, Stabilizing
   To get from Neglected -----> Minded
   Lavender - Calming, Regenerating, Healing
   To get from Unheard -----> Expressed
   Rose - Intimate, Connecting, Radiant
   To get from Isolated -----> Loved
   Roman Chamomile - Bright, Calming, Sweet
   To get from Frustrated -----> Purposeful
   Side Note: I've been using only the purest and most potent essential
   oils that meet the strict Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade Standards
   CPTG. The doTERRA network of botanical growers and distillers.
   Find out more about doTERRA oils here.
   Essential Oils are naturally safe, intuitively simple and highly
   satisfying.

   I put some rose petals on the bottom of the glass container for looks.

   Every week my daughter & I have been enjoying taking baths together.
   Not just any regular baths, we must have roses, bath salts, candle,
   masks (I put a pure honey mask on her) while I use the Orgins brand
   Rose hydrating mask, and even spa music! Let me tell ya ladies, its
   probably one of my favorite things to do right now! We take them in the
   mornings right before her ballet class. Its actually really fun and she
   loves getting pampered and relaxed just like her mama. I just want to
   cradle her and wrap her in my arms nude and all every moment I get with
   her while she's still my little girl. After testing this amazing
   homemade calming bath salts our skin felt so smooth, so soft, no signs
   of redness or roughness, (especially eczema) we smelled like roses. We
   felt calmed and rejuvenated for the remaining of our morning. I hope to
   share more recipes with you of my passion for essential oils.
