Richard A. Birdsey, Ph.D.

   Senior Scientist

   Phone  508-444-1576   |   Email  rbirdsey@whrc.org

   Expertise   North American forests, forest management, inventory and
   monitoring, carbon cycle, climate change mitigation

   Dr. Birdsey is a specialist in quantitative methods for large-scale
   forest inventories and has pioneered development of methods to estimate
   national carbon budgets for forest lands from forest inventory data. He
   recently retired from the U.S. Forest Service as a “Distinguished
   Scientist” and was the Program Manager for global change research in
   the Northern Research Station. He was a lead author of 2 Special
   Reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which was
   awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He was a lead author of the
   first North American “State of the Carbon Cycle” report and is
   currently a member of the science team guiding the second report. He
   has contributed to several assessments of climate change in the U.S. He
   served three years as Chair of the U.S. Government Carbon Cycle Science
   Steering Group. He has published extensively on forest management and
   strategies to increase carbon sequestration, and facilitated the
   development of decision-support tools for policy and management. He was
   recognized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a major contributor
   to creating a new agricultural commodity – carbon. Dr. Birdsey is a
   member of a team of scientists developing and implementing the North
   American Carbon Program, an international effort to improve
   quantification and understand causes of carbon exchange between land,
   atmosphere, and oceans. In recent years he has been actively working
   with Mexico and Canada to improve monitoring, verification, and
   reporting to support climate change mitigation with an emphasis on
   Reducing Deforestation and Forest Degradation and promoting sustainable
   forest management (REDD+) and improving forest management in the three
   countries. He is currently working with the Forest Service National
   Forest System to implement carbon assessments for all of the U.S.
   National Forests.

A Case Where Change is Not Good

   posted on March 13, 2015

   pduffy_sm

   President & Executive Director Philip B. Duffy

   My recent travels between Falmouth and California highlight very
   vividly that both regions are experiencing weather patterns that are
   unprecedented, prolonged, and problematical—and possibly related to
   climate change. Falmouth, of course, is in the grip of a modern-day ice
   age, while California has its second consecutive winter of record
   warmth and record-low precipitation.

   Both of these weather patterns have serious societal consequences.  Our
   local friends need no reminder of the inconvenience, expense, and
   danger associated with record snow and unusual cold.  And when the thaw
   comes—late July, I would estimate—we may be treated to flooding and an
   ocean of mud. In California, the warmth and dryness are a double-whammy
   for the water supply.  The implications of low precipitation are
   obvious. Record warmth means that precipitation comes mainly as rain,
   and the snowpack—an important source of water for the summer dry
   season—is even smaller than it otherwise would be.  When summer
   arrives, the winter’s warmth and dryness will increase fire risk, and
   water scarcity will affect both agricultural and urban users.

   Whether or not these particular examples of extreme weather are in fact
   associated with climate change, there’s no doubt that some forms of
   extreme weather are.  These connections illustrate that climate change
   involves much more than gradual warming.  They also illustrate the
   silliness of oft-repeated arguments that the occurrence of cold or snow
   disproves the reality of climate change, or that climate change is
   beneficial.  Extreme weather is disruptive, expensive, and dangerous.
   Not only that, but any major change in climate is a problem, not
   because the new climate is necessarily “worse,” but because human
   systems—everything from agriculture to snow removal—are very finely
   tuned to the old one.  This is one case where “change is not good,” and
   the unprecedented rate of human-caused climate change is especially not
   good.

   Who could have guessed that climate change might cause extreme snow in
   Massachusetts or a year-long dry season in California?  These examples
   illustrate why the work we do at WHRC to understand climate change and
   its consequences, and to slow its progress, is so important.  Thanks
   for your continued support.
