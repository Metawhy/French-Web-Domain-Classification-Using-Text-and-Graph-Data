   Ubisoft says porting games to Stadia hasn't been a costly affair

Ubisoft says porting games to Stadia hasn't been a costly affair

   Ubisoft is one of the major players known to be working with Google on
   bringing existing games to the cloud-based game platform Google Stadia,
   and the company says that, at this stage, doing so hasn’t been
   incredibly costly.

   Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot and CFO Frederick Duguet briefly addressed
   Stadia during a Q&A with investors this week. While neither would
   comment on specific costs, Duguet said that, as far as platform
   commission goes, “the financial equation is good for us.”

   The original question asked how porting costs compared for Stadia
   versus traditional platforms like PC or physical consoles, though
   Guillemot didn’t offer a direct comparison in his reply.

   “The extra cost to put to make sure the games work well on Stadia is
   not that high,” said Guillemot. “It's part now of our pipelines and we
   have a good relationship with Stadia to make sure it is profitable for
   us.”

   He does note that this largely applies to current titles; what he
   describes as "2.0 types of games" will "need more work and this we will
   see more in the future action."

   Keep in mind however that Ubisoft is somewhat unique in that it
   partnered with Google to bring Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to the
   pre-Stadia Project Stream beta last year, so the two companies do have
   that existing relationship that has no doubt helped to pave the way for
   Ubisoft’s more recent steps towards Stadia.

   The company is notably launching its upcoming Uplay+ subscription
   library on Stadia in 2020, and is so far the first publisher announced
   to bring such a service to Google’s cloud-based platform. Ubisoft just
   recently unveiled more details about Uplay+, taking the time yesterday
   to detail the 100+ games that will be available when the service
   launches for PC later this year.
