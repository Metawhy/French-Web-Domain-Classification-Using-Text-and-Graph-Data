   Sumoschro French synthwave and Swedish post metal. Why the fuck not?
   Two of my favorites collide, and it actually works!

   Kyotofu So much substance, if you could touch the very core of this
   song, it would be an incredibly black void, yet opening on a
   transcendental light. Ethereally intense.

       B-Sides and Remixes, Vol. I
       by Perturbator
       supported by 213 fans who also own ‚ÄúCult of Luna & Julie Christmas
       - Cygnus (Perturbator remix)‚Äù
       I was lured in with the cinematic, industrial New Model style of
       Perturbator 2.0, but this early stuff feels like a good midpoint
       between old and new. The vocals of Dead Astronauts compiled
       together with these mean bangers, make for a really awesome
       listening experience for people who crave tasty ass jams. History
       was made here. Can't wait to hear the new future sound of
       Perturbator wherever it may take us. If James wants to start doing
       country music then screw it, I'll be there. Kris Aroo

       B-Sides and Remixes, Vol. I
       by Perturbator
       supported by 213 fans who also own ‚ÄúCult of Luna & Julie Christmas
       - Cygnus (Perturbator remix)‚Äù
       I was lured in with the cinematic, industrial New Model style of
       Perturbator 2.0, but this early stuff feels like a good midpoint
       between old and new. The vocals of Dead Astronauts compiled
       together with these mean bangers, make for a really awesome
       listening experience for people who crave tasty ass jams. History
       was made here. Can't wait to hear the new future sound of
       Perturbator wherever it may take us. If James wants to start doing
       country music then screw it, I'll be there. Kris Aroo

       Leaning more into the rock side of the 80's sound than the trilogy,
       and that's no bad thing. I fuckin love this record. ewanhoozarmy
