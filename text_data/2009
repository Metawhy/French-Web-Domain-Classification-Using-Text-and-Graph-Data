   have your academic credentials evaluated by the New York State Board of

   the U.S. legal education requirements that will satisfy eligibility

   Register and Apply online through LSAC*

   *Please note that this link will take you to the registration page for
   the LLM Credential Assembly Service. Because the LSAT is not required
   to apply for the Two-Year Global Access JD, LSAC requires that we use
   the LLM database. When you get ready to apply to Drexel you will see
   two options—an LLM application and also the Two-Year Global Access JD
   application. You would, of course, select the latter.

TOEFL or IELTS Scores

For All International Applicants

   International students must submit scores from either the TOEFL or
   IELTS exam.

   An applicant may seek a waiver for the following reasons:
    1. They have successfully completed a Bachelor’s or Doctorate in the
       U.S.
    2. They attended a university outside the U.S. in which English was
       the only language of instruction. This requires a letter submitted
       to the law school or LSAC directly from a Dean or other high-level
       administrator of the school.

   Applicants who seek a waiver will be required to do a phone screening
   with the English Language Center (ELC). The ELC will then send the law
   school their evaluation, and then the admissions committee will
   determine if a waiver may be granted.

For LLM and MLS Program Applicants

   Because the Kline School of Law carefully reviews each individual’s
   application, we strongly encourage students with lower TOEFL or IELTS
   scores to apply. Students with lower TOEFL or IELTS scores who are
   otherwise qualified for the LLM program, are often admitted conditioned
   upon completion of the Drexel English Language Center’s Graduate Bridge
   Program.
