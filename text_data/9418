Discrete curvature - November 18-22, 2013.

   Mar 22, 2013

   lnajman
   W ith Pascal Romon , we are organizing a colloquium on Discrete
   Curvature. The aim of this meeting is to bring together researchers
   from diverse backgrounds (including mathematics and computer science)
   on the common theme of discrete curvature and to make an update on the
   many achievements of the last decade. We want to promote interaction
   between various fields, so topics and participants can and should be
   varied, as long as they fit under the under the main theme. Prestigious
   speakers are already programmed.
   The meeting will take place at the CIRM, in Luminy, near Marseille
   (France), from November 18th to the 22nd, 2013.

Preprint on scene parsing

   Oct 12, 2012
   General
   lnajman
   The preprint of our upcoming IEEE Trans. PAMI on scene labeling is
   available. We use a multi-scale convolutional network trained in
   supervised mode on fully-labeled images in which each pixel is labeled
   by the category of the object it belongs to. A simple superpixel-based
   post-processing smoothes out the output labels and lines up the segment
   boundaries with image contours.

   This is the webpage for the course on Image Analysis and Processing.


   The recommended book for this course is the Digital Image Processing
   book, by Gonzales and Woods. You can find it in the ESIEE library, or
   buy it in any bookshop.


   The Programming session are under a subset of the Pink library, that we
   are developping at ESIEE. As one of the goals of these programming
   session is to develop your expertise in the C language, you do not need
   the whole library, but only a very limited subset, called PinkDev, that
   allows for very basic image operations such as reading and writing an
   image. You can download PinkDev by following the link. You then obtain
   a file name 'pinkdev.tgz'. This means this is a compressed tar file,
   you can extract the archive by running the following command line:

     tar zxvf pinkdev.tgz

   Then go inside the directory, open the README and read it. As stated in
   the README, you will find in the 'doc' directory a file called
   'tutorialEnglish.html'. Open it, and read it.

   You can now start doing some programming, and do the tutorials.


Slides

   The slides are here.
     * Introduction: part1, part2.
     * Image Enhancement
     * Image Transform
     * Image Enhancement in the Frequency Domain
     * Combinatorial optimization for image segmentation (and filtering)



The project


   The project, called Complete Graph Averaging, is described here. A set
   of image is available here.


   Your project will be managed using SVN. You have to create your
   repository using this link. You will have to save all the various
   versions of your code here. I will monitor the activity. If your
   project is submitted in its entirety in just one session, it is
   suspect. Save often, use the versionning system to highlight
   interesting releases.

   You also have to submit a report describing the major difficulties you
   encountered,. This report will also provide a reading guide for your
   code (not a copy of your code), and of course, will answer the last
   question of the project with as many details as needed.
