HOW TO CARVE A PUMPKIN

   October 18, 2018 by Aouad Abdessamad

   It’s October, and everyone knows what that means: Halloween! As soon as
   this month starts scary costumes and makeup start flooding stores, and
   all you can see everywhere are scary (at times too graphic) Halloween
   decorations.

   So we decided why you should stay behind? There is no reason for you
   not to take part in the Halloween spirit. While we know that you may
   not want to invest a lot in Halloween decorations, there is no harm in
   making some on your own.

   What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when we say, Halloween,
   or even fall? Pumpkins, right?

PICKING OUT THE RIGHT PUMPKIN

   The first step for carving a pumpkin is picking out the right pumpkin
   in the first place. It is best to shop at a local produce shop, farm or
   a supermarket that may be offering such pumpkins for sale. Try not to
   buy those pumpkins that have been shipped from distant areas as they
   might have bruises on them, and your decorations may get spoiled in a
   short period of time, which is not something you want! It is best to
   use mature pumpkins, and the way to identify a mature pumpkin is by
   pressing your fingernail lightly into its skin: if the pumpkins skin is
   punctured, it is not yet mature enough. Before you start carving,
   remember to wash the pumpkin really well to get rid of any germs that
   might be on the skin as you don’t want them getting on your hands!


THE TOOLS YOU’LL NEED

   Other than a large mature pumpkin, you’ll need a few more tools
   actually to carve the pumpkin properly. You’ll need a serrated knife
   (for bigger cuts) or a long-handled knife, a small ice cream scoop, a
   smaller knife for more delicate cuts, an apple corer (for making
   holes), tiny saws and an awl. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these
   tools are; you don’t necessarily need all of them, this is just a
   general list of tools needed for carving pumpkins. If you are doing
   this for the first time and don’t want to buy all these new blades, the
   bare minimum you need is:
     * A long-handled knife
     * An apple corer
     * A small, sharp blade

   NOTE: It is best if you don’t involve children in this process,
   especially if you are not using safe tools. As much as the kids might
   want to participate in this fun activity, it is best they are kept
   away!

Stop Buying Avocados. Plant Them in a flower pot and you will always have
Dozens of them

   July 9, 2018 by Aouad Abdessamad

   Avocado trees, probably started in Southern Mexico, were cultivated for
   quite a long time before North America was colonized. The pear-formed
   organic products are heavenly, rich nourishment that makes a great
   topping or eats alone expansion to your eating routine. The trees are
   warm season plants, effortlessly harmed by cold and snow. So, northern
   plant specialists must figure out how to grow an avocado houseplant so
   that they can enjoy this delicious fruit at home.

   Can Avocados Grow Indoors?

   Avocado trees can achieve 80 feet in stature. Most plants do
   inadequately where freezing temperatures persist. This reality prompts
   the inquiry, “Would avocado be able to trees develop inside?” The
   straightforward response to this inquiry is yes. There are many, dwarf
   varieties, which can aid the chilly and mild season gardeners to
   deliver the sound, organic products in their own home.

   The Procedure of Growing an Avocado Houseplant

   Avocado developing inside can begin with a pit. However, it is best to
   start them with a healthy, grafted, dwarf tree. Ripe avocados are grown
   from the right rootstock. A plant created from seed is less likely to
   deliver the natural product. However, it will make a stunning tree.
   Expel the pit from a ready avocado and flush off any abundant tissue.
   Push a system of toothpicks into the pit and suspend it over a glass of
   warm water. The pit should plunge an inch or so into the water at the
   scratched or dimpled end. Place the glass in the brilliant light where
   temperatures are no less than 65 degrees, Fahrenheit (18 C.). Change
   the water regularly. Before long the pit will create roots, which will
   become down into the water. In the end, stems and leaves will grow. At
   the point when the roots fill a significant part of the glass, the time
   has come to transplant to a pot.

   Growing Avocados in Containers

   Avocado developing inside is fun and simple. Move the grew pit to an
   unglazed earthenware pot that is no less than 10 inches across and
   twice as profound as the roots. Utilize a potting mix with compost
   mixed with sand for a free, quick depleting synthesis. Developing
   avocados in compartments inside likewise requires brilliant light. A
   plant will get straggly without satisfactory light. Squeeze off
   abundance development at first to advance a bushier, more grounded
   plant. Try not to expect organic product when developing avocados in
   containers. Indoor plants require cool evenings to drive bloom and for
   fruiting. They can likewise take up to ten years to get to the fruiting
   stage. On the off chance that you do get the organic product, the
   flavor isn’t comparable to those economically delivered from
   rootstocks.

10 Tips For Growing Cucumber Plants

   June 8, 2017 by Aouad Abdessamad

   Cucumbers have always been listed on the mankind’s favorite list since
   the beginning of time, and there is a reason for that. Cucumbers are
   extremely beneficial to us in so many ways that you can’t consider them
   anything less than a blessing. They keep you hydrated, fight off
   cancer, cure sunburn, provide essential vitamins and minerals, reduce
   eye bags, aid in weight loss, freshens mouth odor, stabilize blood
   pressure, good for diabetes and so much more.

   Not only this but you can also consume them in a variety of ways e.g.
   salads, pickles, cucumber juice, soups and side dishes, cucumber facial
   mask, and gels, etc. In light of these two extremely convincing reason,
   there’s only one question left to answer, and that is “where do you get
   the good and organic cucumbers from?” and with these 10 key tips, we
   are about to tell you, the answer to that can be your home.


     * Sunlight is vital for the healthy growth of the cucumber plants.
       For that, you need to choose a planting site for them that is
       direct contact with full, unhindered sunlight under normal climate
       conditions. For regions with a hot climate, however, a planting
       spot under afternoon shade will be the best spot. It will ensure
       healthy growth while not burning and drying the plant either.
     * It is very important to space your cucumber plants appropriately.
       The optimum distance between the plants is 3′ while the rows should
       be 4′ to 5′ apart.
     * Compost and aged manure is food for healthy growth. Adding suitable
       amounts of compost and aged manure to the soil provides essential
       nutrients that are necessary to be abundantly present in the soil
       where a cucumber plant is to be grown. The first addition of
       compost and manure is during planting stage. The second phase of
       addition starts when vines from the plants have grown, and the
       first layer of flowers has developed.
