       additional information in which case you may receive a separate
       privacy statement.  Some of the ways in which Wingify may collect

   information”).

   We store and use this automated information in server log files for
   system integrity and security and in order to be able to investigate
   and prosecute infringements or abuse of our Website and to cooperate

   positive user experience (product and analytics purposes).

   For these purposes, we make accessible and share automated information
   with our security team (for security and prosecution purposes),
   supervisory authorities, and qualified personnel (product, marketing,

   analyzing automated information (Google Analytics and others, see below
   in sections “Google Analytics” and “Marketing automation and customer
   relationship management (CRM).”

   We store the information required for security and prosecution purposes
   on a legitimate interest basis and the information required for

   (or, where required, by obtaining your prior consent). We store this
   data for the period necessary to pursue the purposes outlined in this
   section, or as permitted by applicable statutory laws.

   Double Opt-in procedure for EU users

   The sign-up to receive our newsletters, invitations, and other
   information takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure, i.e.,
   after signing up, you will receive an email in which you will be asked
   to confirm your registration. The registrations are logged to be able
   to prove the registration process. This includes your name, email
   address, the time of registration and confirmation, and your IP
   address.

   concerns. We may archive your message for a certain period or discard
   it, as appropriate or as required by applicable data retention laws.

5. How does Wingify use your information?

    1. Wingify uses the information collected to operate its websites to
       provide you with the Services requested and to contact you about
       your interest in the Services; to verify your information; and to
       plan and host corporate webinars, online forums, and social
       networks. Wingify may also aggregate your information with data
       that is separately provided by you on social media and third-party
       websites if visible to third parties. Wingify may also use data
       from Users, Customers, and Attendees for marketing purposes. For
       example, Wingify may use the information you provide to contact you
       to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you
       information regarding Wingify, its affiliates, and its partners,
       such as information about promotions or events.
    2. When Wingify collects information such as your name or other
       details about you, it is Wingify’s practice to provide you with
       information on how the data will be used at the time you are asked
       for it if that is not immediately apparent. When Wingify asks you
       to provide your information through a registration page or
       otherwise, you will have the option to not consent to the use of
       your personal information to contact you, in which case you may
       still be able to access other portions of this website, although
       you may not be able to access certain sections or services.
    3. Refer to heading 8. “What rights do you have in connection with the
       personal data Wingify collects?” for information on your rights,
       including the right to “opt out” of certain uses of your
       information.

6. How does Wingify address data transfers from the European Economic Area
(EEA)?

   non-EEA countries (referred to in the GDPR as “third countries”) are
   unlawful, unless there is an appropriate “level of protection for the
   fundamental rights of the data subjects”. The transfer of personal data
   outside of the EEA is prohibited unless one or more of the specified
   safeguards, or exceptions, apply:

     "We ran a series of A/B tests based on the data we gathered by using
     Heatmaps, Scrollmaps and Surveys available on the VWO Platform. It
     helped us to identify key elements on our websites that needed a
     deeper look."

     "Earlier, we had to use JavaScript variables to make sure a user can
     only enter one experiment. Therefore, we never ran more than two
     experiments on one page simultaneously.  With VWO, it is
     straightforward and intuitive to validate multiple hypotheses
     simultaneously, while keeping the data reliable. It is easy to set
     up and works wonderfully, we absolutely love it and helps us run
     many more experiments."

     "We have been using VWO for almost 4 years now and the software
     still surprises us. It is very easy to work with and support is
     always available for help in case of development challenges. The
     extra features like heatmaps, session recordings and the surveys
     help us to easily monitor the entire CRO process and connect our
     qualitative insights with A/B tests."
