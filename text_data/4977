Fashions and Fashion Police

   I recently added a game app all about fashion, creating your own looks
   and competing against other fashionistas around the world.
   Oh my! I am so addicted to this game! My husband says it is a natural
   for me, and just feeds into an addiction I already have.
   He's prob'ly right, not that I admit to it!
   Which brings me to the subject of Fashion Police.
   I think we need a mandatory class taught in all schools at the
   Elementary level, and again at the High School level about Fashion.
   What we wear, and what does it say about us?
   In my dreams, I know.
   Seriously though, how many times have you been at a store and thought
   "I wonder what made her decide to wear That in public?!".
   "Does he even own a mirror?"
   "I would be so embarrassed to go anywhere with him (or her) in that
   outfit!"
   I feel a headache comin' on.
   Insert choice of photo here.             X.           As I still can't
   figure out how to from my iPad!
   What does this have to do with trendy fashions? Apparently there are
   some of the above-mentioned wardrobe disasters now being created,
   designed, AND MARKETED to the general public now! As High Fashion! How
   do I know this? Because every item of clothing and accessories in my
   new game are available for purchase, and delivered to my door.
   This makes my fun fantasy game into a potential real life nightmare.
   Yikes!
   I feel a series of Fashion Police blogs comin' on.
   So let's start with a very basic concept.
   UNDERWEAR IS NOT MEANT TO BE A FASHION STATEMENT, NOR AN ACCEPTABLE
   ITEM OF CLOTHING TO BE SEEN OUTSIDE OF THE BEDROOM.
   Underwear is defined as something meant to be worn under clothing. In
   fact your Grandma might still refer to it as your undergarments. Under
   is the key word here.
   I don't care what color bra you are wearing. I don't want to see what
   type of  underwear you are wearing. The thong vs not is not a current
   debate burning in my mind. I don't care if you are wearing name brand
   briefs or WalMart special whiteys. Silk vs cotten blend? Nope, don't
   care.
   Underwear has some specific duties:
   1) protect the body from abrasions. Think riding a horse.
    2) keep body fluids on your body, not mine. Think sitting on a bus
   seat.
    3) holding things in place rather than flapping around. Think a plus
   size body jumping rope.
   4) makes outer garments fit better. Think Grandma in a sheath dress
   with nothing on underneath.
   Yet showing underwear outside the bedroom is becoming more frequent. Is
   this truly a progression in fashion, or are we sliding back to the
   Stone Age? I think you can guess my position on that!
   See you next time when I will approach just what is fashion? And young
   vs more mature fashion choices.

Fireworks and Dogs

   Well, I am still figuring out how to load pictures!
   In your mind, picture an antique graphic with two American flags,
   crossed at the poles.
    The flags are surrounded with vintage florals and fireworks.
   Now you see my picture, hand picked for you!
   Growing pains, bear with me.
   Our dog Tyler barks at the invasion of fireworks and thunder.
   These are 2 things we have no control over,
   so Tyler needs to modify his idea of what we need defending from.
   Not so simple!
   A work in progress, which our neighbors have been testing us with
   almost nightly for a week or more now.
   GAAAAaaaaahhhh
   We live in an unincorporated area of the county, so fireworks are
   legal,
   unless the governor declares all fireworks taboo in the state due to
   high fire risks,
   which is extremely unpopular and not good for reelection.
   We live less than 2 hours from the Wyoming border, a state which
   apparently sells the "big" fireworks that are not sold in Colorado.
   All of this means we have very large fireworks going off behind us,
    across the street and over a block.
   Poor Tyler.
   We are going to try a compression wrap on the Fourth I think.
   (Insert diagram here of how to wrap it!)
   You can purchase thunder shirts for dogs also.
   The idea is that the tighter feeling (like a tight t-shirt) brings
   security and safety to the dog.
   Let me know if you have tried this!
   We'll see if it diminishes dog duties of protection too.
   Must.
   Guard.
   The
   Family!
   The sacred dog code of reason to live

Dog Days of summer

   Is it hot enough for you?
   My personal heat index is rising as I try to figure out how to change
   blog font, text, page placement and color!!!
   I change it but as soon as I type a lettter, it reverts. Grrrrrr.....
   ...and they said write a blog! It will be fun! Relaxing! A creative
   outlet!
   Well, I AM feeling a bit creative...on how to scream in text!
   Bear with me, I'll be fine. I am also using an IPad for the first time
   to blog, so perhaps that is contributing to the bugs.
   We have been so enjoying the seasonal blueberries this time of year. We
   are trying to increase our intake of fruits and veggies. You know, that
   being healthy thing! I would prefer to go meatless, simply because I
   think it is healthier. I don't eat pork or turkey. Beef would be my
   next choice, but that is very hard to give up! Fish is a keeper I
   think.
   What are you doing to try and be healthier? Drop me a line.

   Spring has Sprung and Summer is here!
   [A%2BStroll%2BThrough%2BCantebury%2BPark%2B600dpirsz%2Bwcy.jpg]
   The hot days of summer are here.
   Fortunately I LOVE summer and sun and all the greenery that comes with
   it.
   We went for a drive over the weekend, up to Ft. Collins, Colorado.
   Moderately heavy traffic on the interstate. They are doing road
   construction, so everyone has to slow down and gawk, even though the
   workers had the day off.  Such curious creatures we are!
   The weather was beautiful, the sun was shining and all the trees are
   leafed out. It's good to get out of the house and feel the breeze,
   smell the green, soak up the sun.
   I hope that you can get outside today, and be reminded that God cares
   for you.
   til next time,
   Inkspired

Rising above the bog

   Struggling to get back in the swing of things!
   I have missed my blog, and perhaps you have too! I think I want to
   change the focus a bit, but I am not sure how yet! Been having fun on
   Facebook. You should be able to find me with this:
   Karen Kloberdans
   I just renewed my domain name - myinkspired.
   Very frustrating!!!!
   I cannot find any directions on how to rework my web page
   Myinkspired.com
   Grrrrrr. I am feeling old and rusty!
   So, I put up a temporary web site that is still under construction. You
   can find it here:
   myinkspired.myfreesites.net
   Any-who-how, I have to start somewhere!
   Now, let's try to upload a photo, shall we?
   [A%2BStroll%2BThrough%2BCantebury%2BPark%2B600dpirsz%2Bwcy.jpg]
