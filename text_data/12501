The Arising of Life

   In 2013 all tickets sold out in record time and 200+ nationalities
   gathered in Boom to experience what is now also the most listened to
   music festival on the planet. Several of those nationalities have
   travelled to the festival with a Global Journey Package, the official
   Tomorrowland Travel packages.

The Book of Wisdom

   After winning the International Dance Music Award for Best Music Event
   in Miami for the first time in 2012, Tomorrowland had officially become
   the most global festival on earth. A whopping two million people
   visited the website of the festival, hoping to score a ticket – over
   ten times more than the number of available tickets. Tomorrowland
   launches its own YouTube channel in 2012 – broadcasting DJ sets,
   interviews and behind-the-scenes features. With well over eight million
   people tuning in, Tomorrowland quickly and easily becomes the
   most-watched music festival on the planet. Its official after movie
   adds another one hundred million views (and still counting) to that
   claim.

The Tree of Life

   The demand for tickets was much higher than the years before, so in
   2011 Tomorrowland added a third day. All 180,000 tickets sold out in
   less than a day.

   Pretty much every A-list DJ in the world came to Tomorrowland.
   Spectacular stages, truly phenomenal festival grounds and – last but
   not least – DreamVille, the camping grounds that really made you
   believe you’re inside a dream. During the sixth edition, 25,000
   thousand people spent the night at DreamVille.

   2009

   In 2009, Tomorrowland was successfully launched into orbit, when for
   the first time in its history all tickets are sold-out. Once again,
   temperatures reached record-breaking levels, while surprise act Moby
   widened the festival’s profile and appeal. Belgium’s already rich
   nightlife scene –including some of the world’s most legendary labels,
   clubs, parties and artists in the history of electronic music – had
   finally stepped into to the daylight, and people were watching.

   2008

   In 2008, Tomorrowland’s real breakthrough happened. 50,000 people
   flocked together in Boom for a collective – and quite literal –
   meltdown, and they also prepared for the festival to be sent up in the
   sky and have it orbit the globe for decades to come.

   Soon enough, word also travelled outside Belgium’s borders, and come
   the third edition, people from the Netherlands, France, Germany and the
   United Kingdom travelled to Belgium to unveil the mysteries of
   Tomorrowland. More than 20,000 people were welcomed and for the first
   time, Tomorrowland took place over 2 days.

   In the second year, Tomorrowland took place in July. Word-of-mouth was
   growing stronger throughout Belgium, and with eight stages and enough
   extra space to put up three thousand sleeping beauties, the second
   edition wasn’t only bigger in terms of attendance but also in magic and
   experience.

   2005

   Sunday August 14, 2005 – a magical date in the history of Tomorrowland.
   A brand new festival popped up, transforming the town of Boom into a
   fairy tale dominion, where enchanting electronic music was to be heard
   from behind every tree and out of every rabbit hole. From the start
   Tomorrowland turned out to be a grand spectacle, unlike anything that
   came before it. But this was only the beginning of our fairy tale...
   About 10,000 people bore witness to the first edition of Tomorrowland,
   and to the magic that surrounded it (including DJ sets by Sven Väth,
   Sasha, Armin van Buuren, Erol Alkan and Justice).
