FLEETWOOD MAC ANNOUNCE EUROPEAN TOUR

   Tickets On Sale 26 October 2018 at 9am

   (LONDON, U.K. Monday 22 October 2018) – Legendary, GRAMMY-award winning
   band Fleetwood Mac announced today a European tour, set to kick off in
   June with three exclusive performances currently announced in London,
   Dublin and Berlin. Produced by Live Nation, the tour will feature the
   newly announced line-up of Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Stevie Nicks,
   and Christine McVie along with newcomers Mike Campbell and Neil Finn.

   Tickets for the tour will go on-sale to the general public starting on
   Friday, October 26th at 9am local time.

   A limited number of LaneOne VIP Packages will also be available,
   including amazing seats with premium benefits such as transportation,
   preferred entrance and more. LaneOne premium VIP packages are available
   here.

   “Fleetwood Mac has always been about an amazing collection of songs
   that are performed with a unique blend of talents. We jammed with Mike
   and Neil and the chemistry really worked and let the band realize that
   this is the right combination to go forward with in Fleetwood Mac
   style. We know we have something new, yet it’s got the unmistakable Mac
   sound,” said Mick Fleetwood.

   “We are thrilled to welcome the musical talents of the caliber of Mike
   Campbell and Neil Finn into the Mac family. With Mike and Neil, we’ll
   be performing all the hits that the fans love, plus we’ll be surprising
   our audiences with some tracks from our historic catalogue of songs,”
   said the group collectively. “Fleetwood Mac has always been a creative
   evolution. We look forward to honoring that spirit on this upcoming
   tour.”

   Fleetwood Mac was founded by Peter Green in 1967 and was named after
   Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. After Peter Green left in 1969,
   Fleetwood and McVie remained as original members, and the band has
   since featured a cast of brilliant talents. Most notably, Christine
   McVie joined the band in 1970, with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham
   joining in 1974. The enduring spirit of Fleetwood Mac stands for an
   incredible body of great music that has connected with generations of
   people all over the world for more than 50 years. Fleetwood Mac has
   sold more than 100 million records worldwide and the GRAMMY-award
   winning band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.
