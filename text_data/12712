   What is FreeNAS?


   FreeNAS is an operating system that can be installed on virtually any
   hardware platform to share data over a network. FreeNAS is the simplest
   way to create a centralized and easily accessible place for your data.
   Use FreeNAS with ZFS to protect, store, backup, all of your data.
   FreeNAS is used everywhere, for the home, small business, and the
   enterprise.

   What is ZFS?


   ZFS is an enterprise-ready open source file system, RAID controller,
   and volume manager with unprecedented flexibility and an uncompromising
   commitment to data integrity. It eliminates most, if not all of the
   shortcomings found in legacy file systems and hardware RAID devices.
   Once you go ZFS, you will never want to go back.

Web Interface

   The Web Interface simplifies administrative tasks. Every aspect of a
   FreeNAS system can be managed from a Web Interface.
   [File_Sharing_Icon.png]

File Sharing

   SMB/CIFS (Windows File shares), NFS (Unix File shares) and AFP (Apple
   File Shares), FTP, iSCSI (block sharing), and more.
   [Snapshots.png]

Snapshots

   Happy FreeNAS Users

   “I had an opportunity to implement FreeNAS 8 at a client site and it
   was glorious! I love the jail setup. I love the web interface. So much
   good stuff. You made my professional life better. I appreciate your
   work.”

   Larry Morroni,  Morroni Technologies, Inc.
   www.morroni.com

   “FreeNAS is the go to solution for managing storage. Viewers of my
   podcast often ask me about building servers for work, home and the
   cloud, when storage is involved my answer is always “Just use FreeNAS”.
   FreeNAS leaves you feeling secure in the knowledge that anyone can
   operate its web interface, but you can still benefit from the power of
   the command line.”

   Allan Jude
   Host of the weekly sysadmin podcast TechSNAP.tv

   “I heard about FreeNAS at a conference and realized it was an immediate
   necessity for one of my clients. They had an existing NAS system that
   was not being used to its potential. After I rebuilt their back-up
   system using FreeNAS, their workflow improved by probably 5 times what
   they were able to do do previously.”

   Tim Nagle
   Creative Integrations

   “Creating NFS/CIFS mounts – done. Uploading my music, pictures, videos,
   and documents – done. Sharing my uploads with my PS3, smart TV, and
   tablet – done. I have barely scratched the surface of what FreeNAS can
   do because it has been doing everything I want it to do.”

   Aaron Pierson
   Cloud Computing and Backup Administrator

   “We are a 24/7/365 operation and cannot afford any downtime. FreeNAS
   has helped build our virtualization platform to this effect and has
   provided us with a very flexible system through with a ROI not matched
   by any competitor on either the Open-Source or Closed-Source market.”

   Rob Fauls
   Southern Freight Administrator

   “I’m a big, big fan of the platform. My little FreeNAS box has been
   running without fail for almost a year now and it gets a LOT of use in
   my home. It’s practically earned family-member status.”
