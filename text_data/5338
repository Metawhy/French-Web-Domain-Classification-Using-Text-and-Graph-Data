PIANO DAY 2019

   “Why does the world need a Piano Day? For many reasons. But mostly,
   because it doesn’t hurt to celebrate the piano and everything around
   it: performers, composers, piano builders, tuners, movers and most
   important, the listener.” – Nils Frahm

   Piano Day, a annual worldwide event founded by a group of likeminded
   people, takes place on the 88th day of the year – in 2019 it’s the 29th
   March – because of the number of keys on the instrument being
   celebrated.

   The aim of the day is to create a platform for piano related projects
   in order to promote the development of musical dimensions and to
   continue sharing the centuries-old joy of playing piano. Piano Day
   welcomes all kinds of piano lovers — young and old, amateur and
   professional, of any musical direction – to join in this years
   festivities. It is intended to be the most joyful of all holidays!

JOIN IN 2019!

   The desire to celebrate this versatile instrument is growing greater
   than ever and we are happy to share this energy with you. Here is how
   you celebrate Piano Day 2019 on the 29th of March with us:

GIVE A PIANO

   There are so many pianos that are not being played for several reasons:
   they are broken, stored in piano shops or used as items of furniture
   rather than a musical instruments. At the same time there are loads of
   talented pianists who have no possibility to own a piano. Piano Day
   gives an opportunity for the holders of the unused pianos to place them
   where they can be enjoyed by a lot of people. Everybody who wants to
   share the joy of playing and listening to piano music is invited to
   participate and take action! This initiative was started last year and
   is to be continued!

   Nils Frahm has prepared special Piano Day treats.

   “In the end, every album production leaves you with the same tough task
   – making the choices for the final track selection. You leave out some
   tracks for various reasons: some of the tracks are wonderful by
   themselves, but they simple don’t fit anywhere in the album and others
   have to be left out because otherwise the vinyl would become too long
   for a cut in good quality. However, these outtakes are often as
   important as the final selection and I thought, they might be a great
   surprise for Piano Day too. I hope in this case, it’s both …“

KLAVINS M450

   The first project revealed by the Piano Day team in 2015 was the
   building of what will be the world’s tallest piano, the Klavins M450
   designed by the visionary piano builder David Klavins.

   Unlike traditional concert grand pianos, which are usually built
   horizontally, this giant is orientated vertically. Weighing nearly a
   tonne and standing at 4.5m high the M450 stretches over two floors, a
   design that allows the strings to vibrate better. However, the project
   is not about setting world records in terms of size. The aim of it is
   to expand and go to the not yet reached physical limits of the piano
   instrument and it’s sound and thereby opening doors to new musical
   possibilities and dimensions.

   Because of it’s much longer strings and larger soundboard among other
   factors, the sound of the M450 will be characterised by an even clearer
   sound with a lot more depth and richness of overtones, producing an
   unrivaled large harmonic spectrum and intensity of tone, which will
   increase the musical capabilities of the piano, for modern music in
   particular. M450 is meant to continue the centuries-old history of the
   piano instrument and and it´s evolution which had rather stagnated in
   recent decades.

THANK YOU

   Piano Day would be nothing without you – dear piano lovers all around
   the world. We want to say a heart-felt thank you for your commitment to
   the Piano Day projects. The desire to celebrate this versatile
   instrument is growing greater than ever and we are more than happy to
   share this feeling with you.
