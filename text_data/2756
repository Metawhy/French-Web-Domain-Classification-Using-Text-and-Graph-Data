   I stood in a spruce grove just as the sun rose on a cool morning in
   late June, I closed my eyes and used my other senses to explore this
   special place on the coast of Maine. The air had that clean taste found
   only in wild places. I could smell the turpentine scent of the spruce
   trees. The sphagnum moss underfoot was soft and yielding. But what I
   sensed most immediately was the auditory riot of birdsong as males of
   many bird species—most of them warblers—advertised for mates and used
   song to defend their territories.

   From off to my left in the darkness of a brushy edge I heard the
   witchity-witchity-witchity call of a Common Yellowthroat. From higher
   up in a tall spruce came the distinctive four-note song of a
   Black-throated Green Warbler. In different directions I could hear at
   least four other warbler species, among them a very insistent
   Yellow-rumped Warbler in the tree right over my head and a more distant
   Black-and-white Warbler, whose song I always associate with the squeak
   of an unoiled wheel.

   Every spring, hundreds of millions of migratory warblers like these
   leave the tropics and fly north toward the lumpy, evergreen carpet of
   spruce trees and moss that covers hills and bogs from the eastern
   seaboard all the way west into Alaska. Wherever they settle, these
   birds vigorously defend their territories against neighboring males of
   their own species; this is one reason that the arrival of the warblers
   fills the spruce woods with song, as each male stakes his claim.
   In his research published in 1958, Robert MacArthur famously included
   sketches that noted the foraging differences among warblers in the
   spruce trees. For each warbler species, he denoted areas of the tree
   where that warbler species spent most of its feeding time (clockwise
   from top: Cape May, Blackburnian, Black-throated Green, Bay-breasted,
   and Yellow-rumped warbler). Illustration by Deborah Kaspari. In his

   Cape May, Blackburnian, Black-throated Green, Bay-breasted, and
   Yellow-rumped warbler). Illustration by Deborah Kaspari.

   Yet most of these birds share their territorial space with five or six
   other species of spruce-inhabiting warblers. A black-throated green and
   a yellow-rumped may occasionally squabble for a moment, but most of the
   time they ignore one other.

   The tree-sharing of these breeding warblers is just one example of the
   ecological phenomenon of coexistence, and for the first half of the
   20th century it was a bit of a mystery: how do so many different
   warbler species manage to share the same habitat? Related warbler
   species share so many similarities in feeding and nesting habits that,
   in theory, they should compete acutely with one another, with only the
   best competitor species ultimately winning out to dominate the forest
   by itself.

   In the 1950s, a young graduate student named Robert MacArthur walked
   through these very same spruce woods and wondered himself about how
   warblers divide up their forest. He went on to publish one of the
   most-cited avian ecology studies of all time—Population Ecology of Some
   Warblers of Northeastern Coniferous Forests, a masterpiece that
   launched his illustrious career as one of the founding figures of the
   modern science of ecology.

   Last June, I walked this same woodlot in MacArthur’s footsteps with
   another young graduate student, birding while we mused together about
   how this classic piece of scientific literature has stood the test of
   time. Bik Wheeler, a Master’s candidate in search of a standout thesis
   project, was repeating Robert MacArthur’s original observations to
   track the changes in this bird community that have occurred in the
   intervening decades. I walked alongside Wheeler to indulge a dream: to
   walk through MacArthur’s spruce woods after my own 30 years of studying
   warblers in the field and the laboratory, and to visit for the first
   time a place—and its birds—that was part of my own inspiration to
   become a scientist.

   he’s finding some different warblers that are showing up in different
   places—Black-throated Green (top, left) and Yellow-rumped (top, right)
   warblers still occur there in spruce trees, but American Redstarts
   (top, center), and Black-and-white and Magnolia warblers and Common
   Yellowthroats (bottom, left to right) are scattered throughout the
   forest as well. Today scientists know that species track food resources
   across landscapes, and that the population distribution of birds can
   fluidly change in space and time. Illustration by Chloe Lam, Bartels

What MacArthur learned from the Warblers

MacArthur’s Warblers

   MacArthur discovered that the following five species of warblers on his
   study plots could coexist because each foraged in a different way and
   in different parts of a spruce tree.

   MacArthur’s key insight from observing these Maine warblers was to show
   that foraging in the same trees did not mean that each species used
   their habitat in exactly the same way. By tracking where each type of
   warbler spent most of its time, MacArthur discovered that the five
   species on his study plots could coexist because each tended to
   specialize in foraging in a slightly different way in different parts
   of these spruce trees. The species did overlap considerably, but each
   had a part of the tree to which it seemed best suited: Blackburnian and
   Cape May warblers in the crowns of the trees, Black-throated Green and
   Bay-breasted warblers splitting the middle parts of the trees, and
   Yellow-rumped Warblers around the lower trunk and branches. In essence,
   MacArthur found that instead of evolving differences in foraging
   morphology—like differing bills—these warblers had instead adopted
   differences in foraging behavior.

     MacArthur discovered that the five species on his study plots could
     coexist because each tended to specialize in foraging in a slightly
     different way in different parts of these spruce trees.

   MacArthur’s studies of these warblers helped launch his career, but
   this pioneer of ecology passed away in 1972 at the early age of only
   42, long before I was old enough to read his writings. Although his
   studies of warblers became textbook exemplars of ecological
   coexistence, his Ph.D. thesis and other published works are not
   particularly clear about the exact location of his primary study sites.
   I had long since resigned myself to the idea that their location was
   probably lost to history.

   I was therefore particularly excited when I opened my mail to find a
   letter from Wheeler, who was then just beginning his graduate studies
   at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine. I review proposals
   for a research grant program, and Wheeler was proposing to compare the
   bird community studied by MacArthur in the 1950s to the birds that live
   in those same trees today. He had researched and located MacArthur’s
   exact study site. A few emails and phone calls later, and I was off to
   Maine on an ornithological pilgrimage.

Revisiting the Spruce Woods

   I met Wheeler for the first time at five o’clock on that June morning
   in a parking lot on the coast of Acadia National Park. In a few hours
   this site would overflow with early summer tourists, but at this early
   hour we were the only people present to hear the warblers and other
   birds adding their voices to the dawn chorus. Wheeler pointed toward
   the woods to show how easy MacArthur’s famous study site is to find,
   once you know where to look: it is the sizable patch of spruce woodland
   just behind the Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse, a popular local landmark.
   In fact, you might even have an image of MacArthur’s site in your
   pocket or purse at this very moment, since the 2012 quarter coin that
   features Acadia National Park depicts this same lighthouse with
   MacArthur’s spruce trees easily visible in the background.

   the Eastern United States and Canada. Larvae go through 6 “instars,”
   starting off at a mere 2mm, and growing to about 2.5cm before pupating
   into a moth. Photo by Paul Williams.

   There are no formal trails away from the coastline, but the understory
   is fairly open and we walked easily into the woods. Well within the
   wooded study plot, I could still hear the clanking bells of navigation
   buoys, and the occasional squawk of a Great Black-backed Gull flying
   past above the tops of the spruce trees. But what struck me most was
   how poorly the trees matched my expectations. I had envisioned Robert
   MacArthur strolling through his study site with his neck sore from
   looking upward at warblers, notebook in hand as he recorded where they
   were foraging in the spruces. In my mind’s eye, those trees were living
   versions of his classic schematic diagrams: they stood in the regular
   ranks of a planted spruce plantation where every tree was the same age
   and nearly identical in height and shape, allowing the various warblers
   to separate themselves clearly into their separate feeding zones.

   But nature is messy. Instead of the overgrown Christmas-tree farm of my
   imagination, MacArthur’s site is a wild and unkempt forest, just as (I
   now realize) it must have been 60 years ago. A few old, emergent spruce
   trees rise to 80 feet or so and look something like the perfect
   pyramids in MacArthur’s published figures, but there are also smaller
   spruce trees of all sizes and shapes, along with pines and birches.

Warblers Revisited

   Warbler species in Maine’s spruce woods have changed since MacArthur’s
   study. Black-throated Green and Yellow-rumped Warblers are still
   around, but the others have been replaced by the following warbler
   species.

   It took only a minute for my ears to tell me that the warblers have
   changed, too. Two of MacArthur’s five species were clearly still
   around: at least four Black-throated Green Warblers were countersinging
   to one another, and that Yellow-rumped Warbler still sang loudly from
   somewhere in the tree right above us. Yet nowhere did I hear the
   Blackburnian, Cape May, or Bay-breasted warblers that MacArthur
   observed here in large numbers. Wheeler told me that those species no
   longer breed in these woods, and only occasionally pass through during
   migration.

   In place of those missing species, I heard other warblers: several
   American Redstarts back in the woods, the Common Yellowthroat in the
   bushes at the edge of the road, that squeaky-wheel song of a
   Black-and-white Warbler from a nearby birch tree, and both Magnolia and
   Yellow warblers singing from farther in the distance.

   It turns out that Robert MacArthur’s famous studies at this site were
   atypical even in his own day: they occurred during years of a massive
   outbreak small caterpillar called the spruce budworm. This budworm
   outbreak created an unusual richness of warbler food, and transient
   species such as Cape May Warblers that specialize in budworms moved in
   to take advantage of  this abundance. Soon thereafter, the budworm
   outbreak here ended, and these warblers moved on to other places where
   budworms had become common.

   One of Wheeler’s research questions is whether the different
   combinations of warblers present at the site now still divide up the
   spruce trees, with each species specializing on a slightly different
   zone of the vegetation. Wheeler has the advantage of dictating his
   foraging observations into a digital recorder, but otherwise his
   approach mirrors that of MacArthur, with many hours in the woods spent
   in careful observation of birds as they move about the trees.

New Discoveries

   Even after a single field season, Wheeler has discovered one truism:
   foraging warblers are very challenging to follow in dense vegetation,
   as these rapidly moving birds often disappear behind foliage or fly off
   to a distant tree. MacArthur’s sample sizes of warbler observations
   were surprisingly large given these difficulties, which he too must
   have encountered. Perhaps warblers overall were far more numerous in
   these woods in his years, or maybe he made multiple observations on the
   same bird in rapid succession, a method that we now understand to be
   statistically unadvisable but was standard practice in MacArthur’s day.

   In any event, it will take Wheeler another season or two to compile
   enough observations to contrast them with the classic patterns reported
   by MacArthur. Yet whatever Wheeler ultimately finds, his revisiting of
   this classic study system is bound to tell us something new about how
   bird species coexist across time in ecological communities, even beyond
   the foraging divisions that MacArthur documented in these woods.

   What is already clear is that—in addition to the ways in which these
   warblers divide up particular trees while foraging—the different
   species also respond in various ways to broader environmental variation
   in time and space. In these wider dynamics, each species does best
   under conditions that are slightly different.

   Put these two factors together—species that do slightly different
   things when they co-occur and that respond somewhat differently to
   habitat variation on a grander scale—and we can build on MacArthur’s
   insights. Warbler species mix and match in a grand variety of
   communities all across North America. This spruce woodlot on the coast
   of Maine still stands as an exemplar of how species coexist by being
   just a little different from one another.
