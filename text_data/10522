     Dynnex Drones customer service has been fantastic! These guys are
     quick to respond to any questions or issues, my drone was shipped
     with a tracking number sent to me within 2 days, and I recieved my
     drone about a week later. I highly recommend this company and will
     continue to do business with them in the future.

   A++ to do business with! – Shaun J.
   Verified Buyer

     DynnexDrones was a joy to work with. Fast. Friendly. Communication
     was excellent. Usually I won't write reviews, but they deserve one.
     The price point was as you would find anywhere. There is no real
     room for wiggle there, so when that's equal across board you have to
     look at other things in a seller... read more
