       The Possibilities are Endless...is a film, a hymn to happiness,
   directed, gorgeously, by Ed Lovelace and James Hall about Edwyn. About
          finding his way back to music, to life, to understanding.

Art Work and Bum Fuzz

   Posted by scott owen on May 5, 2017 at 17:15 0 Comments 0 Likes

   My Bum Fuzz unit just arrived in California along with some plectrums
   with Edwin art. It took me along time to order this unit, but the
   twenty five year gestation period for it to be built surely eclipses my
   lack of urgency. Best regards all...

Thank you for the music

   A while back I asked Edwyn if he would let me use his music on a little
   film I made.  Here is the result: Mill Mechanics

   Thanks for that.

The Eureka moment has arrived and the possibilities are REAL !
