   of this truly unique place!

ABOUT US

   This is the official website of Romeo & Giulietta’s Hideaway Inn, an
   award winning B&B/Inn situated in the center of Lake George Village.
   The purpose of this site is not only to inform our guests about our
   property and activities in the area, but also to promote Lake George as
   a romantic destination.

   Lake George has been know for decades as a great family destination and
   a great outdoor adventure spot. However, not many are aware of the
   wonderful romantic experience that Lake George can offer to couples.
   Many of our guests have commented how their stay in our Inn/B&B and the
   wonderful activities that they enjoyed together while here did wonders
   to rekindle their relationship or to bring them closer together!

   So, along with providing information about our property, suites and
   amenities we will also strive to provide couples with some ideas to
   make their trip more memorable. The “Blog” portion of our site will
   regularly contribute ideas for enjoyable activities that a couple can
   do in the area.

OUR INN/B&B

   Here at Romeo & Giulietta’s Hideaway Inn you will easily loose track of
   time! It is a great base to explore the Adirondacks from and especially
   to enjoy all of the wonderful activities that Lake George Village has
   to offer. Of course even if you never left our property your stay would
   be complete! Enjoy relaxing with your partner in our gardens, sipping a
   cappuccino in our breakfast nook, or simply rest in your beautifully
   furnished and romantically decorated suite!

   Whatever you chose to do with your time, you will savor every minute of
   your stay together here at our Inn/B&B! We have a total of 5 finely
   decorated romantic suites to choose from. A lot of our furnishing were
   brought over from Italy, others were purchased here in the states,
   however, all contribute to the renaissance style decor that adds so
   much to the atmosphere of the property.

   The Inn is family run and very different from the commercial style and
   atmosphere that is so common in a typical big hotel! Many of our guest
   comment about how they feel like that are visiting family when they
   come and stay with us. Of course with a big difference: they have a lot
   of privacy! Four of our suites are located in a beautiful stone unit in
   back of the main house, each suite has its’ own entrance, private
   bathroom and kitchenette. So, different from many B&B/Inns, privacy is
   not an issue.

THE PROPERTY NAME

   The name of the Inn —Romeo & Giulietta’s Hideaway— came about in an
   interesting way. Lake George reminded them a lot of Lago di Garda,
   which is located on the outskirts of Verona. Verona is the “hometown”
   of Romeo and Juliet (Giulietta in Italian). It is where Shakespeare was
   inspired to write the play, the house that inspired Juliet’s balcony is
   still there and has become a tourist attraction.

   The likeliness of Lago di Garda to Lake George made them brainstorm
   ideas connected to Romeo and Juliette. Until they settled on the idea
   of Romeo & Giulietta’s Hideaway (keeping the Italian spelling of
   Juliet).

   They continued with the theme as they named the separate suites coming
   up with names such as: Romeo’s Haven, The Giulietta Suite,
   Shakespeare’s Den, The Verona Suite and the Renaissance Suite.

   Their work on the property was so remarkable that they were awarded
   the VILLAGE OF LAKE GEORGE 2016 BEAUTIFICATION AWARD. Each year the
   town picks the business that they feel made the most stunning changes
   to their property and in an award ceremony in Shepard’s Park the Mayor
   hands out the award. When Jonathan saw that they were among the
   candidates he was happy, but never imagined that they would win since
   they were up against some pretty big names, however, to their surprise
   they were given the award!

A GREAT PLACE FOR A ROMANTIC GETAWAY!

   As was mentioned earlier Lake George is a great place for couples to
   enjoy each others company and rekindle or strengthen their
   relationship. Staying in such a romantic atmosphere can increase the
   effects a hundredfold! ENJOY YOUR TRIP AND THE COMPANY OF YOUR LOVED
   ONE HERE IN LAKE GEORGE!!!
