      Opt-Outs AND WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT

   If you are located in the EU and we are relying on your consent to
   process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your
   consent at any time. To withdraw your consent, or to learn more about
   your rights as a data subject, please see the EU USERS BELOW paragraph
   below. Regardless of whether you are located in the EU or elsewhere,
   you may exercise the applicable opt-out options below.


      Web Browser/Cookie-Based Opt-Out

   You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or
   remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser
   preferences. There are also many programs that allow you to manually
   delete your cookies.

   The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you
   may opt-out of receiving targeted ads/interest-based advertising from
   us, our data partners and our other advertising partners that
   participate in self-regulatory programs. You may use the NAI opt-out
   tool at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, which will allow
   you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from us and other members. The
   DAA’s opt-out tool can be found at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
   EU users who have provided their consent to our use of cookies and
   similar technologies to process their personal information (see the
   paragraph titled RIGHTS FOR EU USERS below) can use the EDAA’s opt-out
   tool which can be found at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.

   To be clear, the opt-out from targeted ads must be performed on each
   device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you
   have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be
   effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each
   device.  However, once you have opted out on one device (“Opted-Out
   Device”), we will not use any new data from the Opted-Out Device to
   identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes,
   and will not use data from another device for interest-based
   advertising purposes on the Opted-Out Device.

   If you erase or otherwise alter your cookie/device settings (including
   upgrading certain browsers or devices) you may need to perform each
   opt-out process again, unless we can match the device as outlined
   above.

   Even if you opt out of targeted ads based on cookies, you may still see
   ads based on other general factors such as webpage context or browser
   type.


      Mobile Application-Based Opt-Outs

   Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. Users
   may opt out of certain advertisements on mobile applications or reset
   advertising identifiers via their device settings.  To learn how to
   limit ad tracking or to reset the advertising identifier on your iOS
   and Android device, click on the following links:
     * iOS – https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074
     * Android – https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en

   You may also download and set your preferences on the App Choices
   mobile application(s) available in Google Play or the Apple App stores.


      Third Party Marketing Opt-Out

   If you do not want your personal information shared with any third
   party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes, then
   you may opt out of such disclosures by sending an email to
   rm-privacy@mail.rakuten.com. However, we are not responsible for
   removing your personal information from the lists of any third party
   who has previously been provided with your information in accordance
   with this Privacy Policy.


      USE OF INFORMATION

   We use information, which may include personal information, held about
   you to perform the Services and for other purposes outlined below. You
   can find out more about our Services at https://rakutenmarketing.com.

   Specifically, we use your information as follows:
     * Sharing it with third parties such as Business Customers,
       advertising partners, Ad Networks, Data Providers and corporate
       affiliates. This is in order to allow our Business Customers to
       operate online advertising campaigns, conduct internal analysis to
       perform and to improve the effectiveness of the advertising
       services we provide to our Business Customers, associated
       technologies, and the services of our corporate affiliates.
     * Combining information we collect about you with information we
       obtain from Business Customers and other partners, Ad Networks
       and/or other companies such as Data Providers including our
       corporate affiliates (pursuant to their own privacy policies). This
       is in order to provide Services to our Business Customers such as
       tools to see how their website or mobile applications are used and
       tools to enable the display of targeted advertisements across
       multiple devices. This gives the capability to conduct internal
       analysis in order to perform and improve the effectiveness of the
       online advertising services that we provide to our Business
       Customers and the services of our corporate affiliates.
     * Determining whether a web user profile fits a relevant segment
       (e.g., a web user that visits a sporting good website might fit
       within the segment of users interested in sporting goods).
     * Presenting advertisements tailored to interests you have shown. For
       example, if you are searching for information on a particular
       product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on
       other websites or applications you view with information on that
       product. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you
       will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. We may
       use Ad Networks to deliver advertisements and related services to
       you on behalf of our advertisers.
     * Determining whether multiple devices (e.g., a desktop computer and
       a mobile phone) are connected by applying probabilistic techniques
       (e.g., algorithmic and other mathematical techniques) to data that
       we collect. For example, determining the probability that a desktop
       web cookie and a mobile device belonging to the same user. We may
       supplement such probabilistic data with deterministic data (e.g.,
       unique identifiers). We may also share this device matching
       information with our Business Customers to enable them to provide
       advertising, analytics or other services.
     * Determining whether you have seen a particular advertisement before
       to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.
     * Understanding the patterns of people who see advertisements.
     * Providing insights and reporting back to Business Customers and
       other partners. This includes statistical reporting in connection
       with the activity on a website or mobile application, optimization
       of the location of ad placement, ad performance, reach and
       frequency metrics, billing, and logging ads served on a particular
       day to a particular website or application.
     * Determining the probability and nature of connections between
       devices.
     * Creating online advertising models through lookalike modeling or
       similar research methodologies.

   As noted in the paragraph above, we may share information we collect
   about you with third parties such as our Business Customers, advertiser
   partners, Ad Networks and Data Providers. Third parties are not bound
   by this Privacy Policy. As such, except as provided herein or under
   applicable law, their use of any information or other data we share
   with them, third-party cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies
   may be governed by their own privacy policy or permissions you granted
   them.

   To be clear, we may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, collect
   or create information that is not personal information such as sets of
   aggregate data and other generalized information, including information
   about browsing, usage and interactions and de-identified personal
   information that does not reveal your identity. We retain the right to
   use and disclose information that is not personal information in any
   manner permitted by law.


      DO NOT TRACK

   There is currently no universally recognized standard for Do Not Track
   signals. Accordingly, at this time, cookies used on our website and
   used in providing our services do not respond to any Do Not Track
   signals or browser settings. You may opt-out of receiving cookies by
   adjusting your web browser settings to reject cookies.


      YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

   California Law permits our customers who are California residents to
   request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal
   information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To
   make such a request, please contact us by email,
   rm-privacy@mail.rakuten.com or write to us at the address listed under
   Contact Information.


      RIGHTS OF EU USERS

   If you are located in the EU and EU data protection law applies to the
   processing of your information, we provide the controls described in
   this policy so you can exercise your right to request access to,
   update, remove and restrict the processing of your information. You
   also have the right to object to the processing of your information or
   export your information to another service.

   When you first visit a website or application, we read cookies and
   similar technologies on the internet browser of your device or in
   connection with applications you use that allows us to identify
   browsers and devices that have previously interacted with our Services
   or Business Customers.  This initial reading of cookies and similar
   technologies allows us to determine whether you or the user(s) of your
   device, have previously given consent to the use of “personal data” as
   defined under applicable EU law.

   Apart from this initial browser or device reading, if you are located
   in the EU then the references in this privacy policy to the collection
   and use of your personal data will occur only after we determine the
   appropriate legal basis to process such information: (i) consent, (ii)
   legitimate interest (as described below), or (iii) our compliance with
   a legal obligation. References to the opt-out possibilities set forth
   above will apply to you if you have first given consent to the use of
   your personal data as outlined below. Then you may choose to limit how
   we may use your personal data.  EU users also have specific rights
   which are enumerated below.


      Legal Basis For Using EU User Personal Data:

   In the EU, the processing of your personal data must rely on a legal
   basis. For these regions, there are different legal bases that we rely
   on to use your personal data, namely:
     * Legitimate interest: We may process your personal data for
       consumers, Business Customers, and our legitimate interests. For
       example, to provide or improve our Services, perform affiliate
       matching (e.g., for determining referral fees or commissions owed
       to Business Customers), manage relationships with Business
       Customers, or for security purposes and fraud prevention. When we
       process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we
       put in place safeguards to ensure that your privacy is protected
       and to ensure that our legitimate interests are not overridden by
       your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms
     * Consent: Our Business Customer and us will rely on your consent to
       use your personal data (including, without limitation, technical
       data, cookie data, usage information, and geo-location data), for
       personalized or interest-based advertising purposes. This allows
       our Business Customer and us to find other consumers with similar
       online behaviors to create lookalike modeling or to share your
       personal data with third parties for their marketing purposes. You
       may opt-out of your data usage at any time by using this Subject
       Access Request page or by using the tools outlined above.

   In  addition to the other rights outlined above, individuals based in
   the EU also have the right to be informed of the following:
     * Data Sharing: The direct recipients of your personal data include
       our corporate affiliates, as well as Business Customers such as
       advertisers and publishers in the Rakuten Ad Network.  There may
       also be indirect recipients of a limited amount of personal data
       based on your internet activity because of how advertising
       technology and digital marketing function.  Among the types of
       entities who may access data are: agencies, agency trading desks,
       retargeting entities, ad servers, privacy verification entities,
       measurement and analytics entities, data suppliers, data
       aggregators, demand-side platforms and supply side platforms, ad
       networks, and others on ours or our Business Customers’ behalf.
     * Duration of the Processing: Rakuten Marketing may actively process
       your personal data for one year from the time of your last
       interaction with our Services or the websites or applications of
       our Business Customers (“Interaction Date”).  We may, however,
       store your data in a pseudonymized or anonymized form for up to
       seven (7) years after the Interaction Date in order to comply with
       other legal requirements.  After such time we delete your personal
       data from our system(s).
     * Transfers of Personal Data: Rakuten Marketing and our Business
       Customers may be located in various countries throughout the
       world.  As a result, personal data may also be transferred from the
       EU to the United States and other jurisdictions whose laws may
       differ from those in the EU.  Rakuten Marketing relies on the
       Rakuten, Inc. Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) for legal data
       transfers outside of the EU within the Rakuten Group companies.
       The Luxembourg Data Protection Authority, acting as the lead
       authority for Rakuten, Inc., has approved the BCR.   The BCR
       ensures your personal data is protected by requiring all Rakuten
       Group companies to follow the same rules when processing your
       personal data. For more information on the BCR’s please visit
       https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html. For data transfers
       to entities outside of the Rakuten Group in countries that have not
       been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the
       European Commission, we may use specific contracts promulgated by
       the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.


      EU Data Subject Rights

   Under certain circumstances, EU users have rights under data protection
   laws in relation to your personal data, including as follows.
     * Access, Correction, Restriction, Erasure and Portability: You have
       the right to (i) access your personal data which we may have in our
       system(s); (ii) request correction of your personal data we have in
       or system(s); (iii) object to or request that we restrict the
       processing of your personal data under certain circumstances; (iv)
       request erasure of your personal data from our system(s) under
       certain circumstances; and (v) request transfer of your personal
       data out of our system(s) in a commonly used format. To exercise
       the access, correction, restriction, erasure and portability
       rights, please fill out the form located here and provide the
       verification information as stated on the form.

     * Withdrawal of Consent: Where we are relying on consent to process
       your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
       any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
       processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. In order
       to withdraw your consent, please use the go to the data subject
       access request page and submit a request.

     * Right to Lodge a Complaint: EU users also have the right to lodge a
       complaint about Rakuten Marketing processing your personal data
       with your local data supervisory authority. We would, however,
       appreciate an opportunity to address your complaint before you
       approach the supervisory authority so please contact us in the
       first instance with any complaints you may have by sending an email
       to rm-subjectrequests@mail.rakuten.com.

   Rakuten Marketing will use all reasonable efforts to facilitate your
   exercise of the above rights in accordance with applicable data
   protection laws.  Please note that in order for you to assert these
   rights, we need to verify your identity to confirm your rights. This is
   a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any
   person who has no right to receive it. In order to verify your
   identity, we may need to gather more personal data from you than we
   currently have.


      SECURITY

   We take appropriate reasonable security measures to protect against
   unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
   destruction of personal information. This includes the necessary

Always Learning

   With access to insights spanning Rakuten’s global memberships, Rakuten
   Marketing Data is comprised of rich transactional data combined with
   advertiser and publisher data from our partners. Our system is
   constantly learning, bringing your customers into sharper focus every
   minute.

Strategic Insights

   Through comprehensive analysis of our Data, we build a keen
   understanding of consumers—who they are, what they value, where they’ve
   been and where they’re going. These consumer insights, combined with
   multi-channel attributed data, enable intelligent optimization across
   every strategic campaign for increased effectiveness and scale. These
   insights don’t just sit with us; we give our clients full visibility
   and access through our reporting platform.

Powered By Intelligence

   Our AI is already in place, getting more intelligent and attuned every
   day and delivering industry-leading results. Connecting our Data with
   powerful analytical tools, our AI then puts that insight to work,
   creating the best experience for your customers—and your brand.

The Network Effect

   We work with more than 150,000 publishers around the globe and the
   biggest brands on the planet. But the foundation of our success is
   working together. When our Data, insight and intelligence are shared
   between our advertising and publisher partners, the true power of the
   network effect is revealed.

Together as One

   All of this enables you to be the catalyst for delivering stronger
   performance. Discover how our solutions for publishers and marketers
   can help you connect to today’s consumers in personalized and powerful
   ways and create meaningful experiences tailored to each individual.
