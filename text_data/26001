   Instagram post 2139694897272176966_816030995 Have you seen this book?
   Almost by Richard Torrey is the perfect book for teaching kids about
   growth mindset. Similar to the idea of "I can't do it YET", this idea
   identifies skills kids are working towards, goals they have, and things
   they can ALMOST do. That is super motivating! I suggest reading the
   book, brainstorming all the things that kids can almost do, and getting
   them to write about their "almost" goals. 👉🏼See the writing template I
   created to help! What’s your favourite book for teaching growth
   mindset? Click the 🔗 in my profile for more growth mindset ideas! *⁠ *⁠

   Instagram post 2134551662593091407_816030995 I LOVE children's
   social-emotional books! ⁠What's your favorite book to read to children?
   👇TELL ME below. HEART those you love too! ❤️⁠ ⁠ If you haven't read In
   My Heart by Jo Witek, you must and add it to your social-emotional book
   collection! It takes you through different emotions and how each makes
   your heart feel. 💗⁠ ⁠ This book is great for grades 1-5. Younger kids
   will learn how each emotion is different and begin to relate to the
   descriptions. Older kids will be able to share their own experiences
   with different emotions. An excellent book to build self-awareness!⁠ ⁠

   some ideas on how to use: ❤️During storytime or role play activities,
   kids can hold up the feeling they believe the main character or
   classmate is feeling. 🧡During morning meeting or anytime you meet to
   discuss feelings, kids can share how they are feeling by holding up a
   stick. 💛Kids can place a feeling stick in their teacher's hand or on a
