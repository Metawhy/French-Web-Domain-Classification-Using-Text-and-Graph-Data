   Even for the most world-weary traveller, there is something very
   special about Amsterdam.

   The city’s olive-green canals and handsome gabled mansions are indeed
   beautiful, but perhaps above all, it’s the flavour of the city that
   appeals – its inhabitants a creative and imaginative bunch who quite
   simply bring the place alight.

   In the 17th century, Amsterdam boomed as a trading city, its merchant
   fleet transporting goods to every corner of the globe. This was
   Amsterdam’s Golden Age, the age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and it
   witnessed the construction of the fine mansions that are such a feature
   of the city today. Yet, the grandeur did not last and, surprising as it
   may seem today, Amsterdam in the 1950s was a staid and rather
   provincial city with a hesitant future.

   The 1960s changed all that. Suddenly, Amsterdam found a new
   counter-cultural voice, becoming a hotbed of hippy action and all that
   entailed – with sit-ins and love-ins galore. Neither were the hippies
   without humour, as their well-planned ‘happenings’ focused on playful
   games highlighting specific urban problems from pollution to a lack of
   social housing.

   Young Amsterdammers were energized, and the hippy movement infused the
   city with an adventurous spirit that survives today: it’s reflected in
   a string of cultural events such as Pride and King’s Day, a platoon of
   inventive art and photography galleries, and a penchant for design,
   from designer toothbrushes to a speciality condom shop, which manages
   to stretch everyone’s imagination.

Amsterdam has an exciting contemporary art scene

   Amsterdam’s contemporary art scene is exhilarating – and intensely
   international. The city boasts the showcase Stedelijk Museum, which may
   look something like a giant bathtub from outside, but its temporary
   exhibitions are both avant-garde and highly rated. Amsterdam is also
   blessed with two top-ranking photography museums, Huis Marseille and
   Foam, a hipster hang-out popular with the young creatives who have made
   such a mark on the city. These same creatives also support a string of
   sleek, private art galleries; however, if you are looking to buy,
   prices are predictably eye-watering.

Works of art from Amsterdam’s Golden Age are world-renowned

   Amsterdam’s Golden Age witnessed an extraordinary flourishing of the
   arts – and much of it is displayed here in Amsterdam, adding greatly to
   the city’s allure. The most famous Golden Age painter was Rembrandt,
   arguably one of the greatest artists of all time, but there were many
   other talented figures, too, such as Johannes Vermeer, Frans Hals and
   Jan Steen. In the particular, the city’s premier art museum, the
   capacious Rijksmuseum, holds a wonderful, world-class collection of
   paintings from the Golden Age, most notably a hatful of works by
   Rembrandt, with its closest rival being a specialist art museum, the
   remarkable Van Gogh Museum.

The Koningsdag (King’s Day) celebrations are something to behold

   Nominally, this riotous festival is held in honour of the king –
   Willem-Alexander, who looks very much like a stereotypical banker – but
   it’s really more of a national knees-up in which even the most sensible
   of Amsterdammers seem to throw caution, and sometimes self-respect, to
   the wind. Wear something orange: it’s the national colour, and everyone
   else does, from hats and wigs through to capes and shoes. There are
   outdoor concerts, boat parties and a parade or two – if you can squeeze
   through the multitudes. Held on 27 April – or on 26 April if the 27th
   falls on a Sunday.

One word: Jenever (for the uninitiated, that’s ‘gin’)

   When you visit Amsterdam, be sure to try Dutch gin (‘jenever’), which
   is a bit weaker and a little oilier than English gin. It is served in
   small glasses and sold at a number of specialist gin bars, but is
   widely available elsewhere. Choose from oude (old) or jong (young) or
   korenwijn, which has a malty, oaky flavour. A glass of beer with a
   jenever chaser is called a kopstoot – and it will soon lay you low or
   incoherent.

The Dutch capital is a cyclist’s haven

   There is no getting away from it – Amsterdam is pancake-flat. The great
   bonus is that this makes it perfect for cycling, and that’s exactly
   what city folk do by the thousand. This is citizen cycling – so no need
   for figure-hugging lycra and other specialist clobber – and, even
   better, Amsterdam has a legion of bike-hire outlets. Cyclists can
   relax, too – well almost: motorists are especially keen not to clip
   cyclists; this is not to do with an excess of kindness, but rather
   highway rules that favour the pedallers.

Amsterdam’s modern architecture reflects a sensitive approach to city design

   Almost without exception, and this is one of its main appeals,
   Amsterdam has dodged the soaring skyscrapers that have scarred so many
   cities, opting instead for a much more organic approach –
   citizen-sensitive development at its best. In the city centre, the
   prime example is the Eye Film Museum, housed in a graceful, shimmering
   structure with sleek angular lines. Away from the centre, the Het Schip
   municipal housing estate is a high-spec, early 20th-century development
   in a flourishing Expressionistic style, while the reclaimed islands of
   the Oosterdok abound with stylish houses and apartments offering gentle
   canal and river views.

The impressive beer offering goes beyond Heineken

   The days when it was hard to get any beer apart from pilsner in
   Amsterdam are long gone, and although Heineken still rules the
   alcoholic roost, you are now spoilt for choice: a brigade of small,
   specialist bars sell all manner of domestic and imported beers –
   Belgian beers are especially popular – and there are also half a dozen
   city-based craft breweries: try, for example, the brews of either
   Brouwerij ‘t Ij or Brouwerij De Prael.

Amsterdam’s parks and green spaces are a great escape

   You don’t associate Amsterdam with green spaces, but on a hot summer’s
   day, there is nothing better than joining the locals at their favourite
   park, the Vondelpark, whose lush greenery drapes itself around a
   serpentine canal and its dinky little footbridges. For something a
   little wilder, take the tram to the wooded parkland of the Amsterdamse
   Bos, or catch a ferry over the River IJ and cycle to the small towns of
   the Ijsselmeer – rural Marken is the prettiest.

The city’s canal system has an interesting history

   With every justification, Amsterdam is famous for the beauty of its
   canals, a network of narrow waterways that surpass every expectation
   and rival Venice in their historic charm. Most visitors opt for a canal
   cruise, but there are other, better ways of enjoying the waterways: the
   canal hop on-hop off service escapes much of the tourist throng to
   explore quieter parts of the city, while the energetic can hire a
   four-seater pedalo and thrash away to see exactly how far they can get.

Amsterdam’s Pride celebration is one of the year’s happiest

   The flourishing LGBTQ community in Amsterdam is a real boon to the
   city, and the high point is Pride, held in late July and early August.
   There are street parties, exhibitions, a parade and scores of
   supporting events spread across the city centre, not to mention a
   lively and elaborate canal parade with decorated floats jamming the
   waterways.

The design stores pack a distinctive product offering

   Discovering unique and immaculately designed products in Amsterdam is
   simple. Surprises include a specialist shop devoted to the humble
   toothbrush, but the pick of the lot is Droog, a design shop par
   excellence. The emphasis here is on the domestic, but – as they so
   aptly put it – “We treat serious matters in a playful way.” Hard to
   beat.

   This charming restaurant in Amsterdam-Oost easily ranks among the best
   spots for vegan cuisine in the city (if not the entire country) and
   serves a refined selection of meat, dairy and egg-free meals inside an
   Art Deco-inspired dining room. Many of the dishes available at Mr. &
   Mrs. Watson traditionally contain animal products, but have been
   cleverly altered to meet vegan requirements, without sacrificing their
   appearance or taste. For instance, the restaurant serves a steaming
   hot, vegan fondue made from cashew nuts, plated inside a crispy white
   bun, and Dutch-style croquettes, filled with spicy chilli or Thai
   coconut curry.

   Rather than solely relying on external producers for ingredients,
   Restaurant de Kas cultivates many of the herbs and vegetables that
   appear on its menu inside its onsite greenhouse and at another, larger
   plot located just outside Amsterdam. In order to ensure its meals are
   fresh, healthy and delicious, Restaurant de Kas tailors its changing
   daily menu around its greenhouse’s and farm’s current harvest, creating
   simple, elegant dishes that are inspired by classic Mediterranean
   cuisine. The restaurant itself stands inside an enormous greenhouse
   with large plate windows, that was once owned by Amsterdam’s
   municipality. This stunning location seats 140 guests and lies in the
   centre of Amsterdam-Oost’s Frankendael Park.

   photographs of mothers from its guests, which are displayed on its
   walls, forming an enormous shrine to mums from all over the world.

   This waterborne restaurant was built inside an industrial, offshore
   platform that once served as a broadcasting station for a Dutch pirate
   TV and radio station. The tower originally stood off the coast of the
   Netherlands, but has since been moved to Amsterdam’s Houthaven harbour,
   then converted into a panoramic, modern restaurant. Nowadays, guest can
   enter REM-Eiland from a long jetty and choose between several seating
   options spread inside the platform’s metallic upper levels. REM Eiland
   mainly serves classic, brasserie-style meals that centre around premium
   cuts of meat, locally sourced fish or hearty vegetables, and offers à
   la carte and table d’hôte menus.

   Although it doesn’t strictly qualify as a restaurant, this popular food
   court in Amsterdam-West definitely deserves consideration due to the
   wide range of cuisines and other smaller snacks available within its
   walls. There are 20 different stalls located inside Foodhallen, that
   serve everything from fresh temaki (sushi hand rolls) to artisanal
   Dutch pub grub, making the venue an absolute haven for foodies. What’s
   more, Foodhallen is part of larger hub called de Hallen, housed inside
   a former tram depot, and features several other awesome cultural
   hotspots, including a nine-screen, arthouse cinema complete with bar.

   Considering its rather self-explanatory name, no prizes for guessing
   this trendy restaurant in Amsterdam-West tailors its menu around
   mussels and gin. In fact, most of the restaurant’s menu is dedicated to
   this match-made-in-heaven, with some additional space left for other
   seafood staples such as soft shell crab and shrimp burgers. There are
   five different mussel-centric dishes available alongside over a dozen
   gin-based cocktails, which are served in large wine glasses. Though
   there’s plenty of space inside Mossel & Gin, guests can also eat al
   fresco and enjoy their orders on the restaurant’s sun-soaked terrace,
   which stands in the centre of Westerpark.

   love of innovative design.

   Fancy a stay on an old dockland crane or in a refurbished tram depot?
   No problem. Amsterdam is packed with inventive boutiques, each offering
   a taste of the city’s quirky flavour. Amsterdam is a popular travel
   destination, so in all cases, booking well in advance is strongly
   advised.

   an inviting lobby where locals and hotel guests meet to shoot the
   breeze. Lively and convivial, the hotel holds a gallery featuring the

   the local supermarket. Three cheers for that.

   different world, for this is retro chic to all-encompassing effect:
   period details like the marble fireplaces jostle with the vivid, velvet
   wallpaper while lush fabrics in purple, red, black and gold abound. The
   bar and breakfast room is similarly sumptuous, inviting you to sink
   into a sofa and unwind.

   No one was quite sure what to do with the old tram depot in Amsterdam
   West, but the new owners had a brainwave, converting it into a boutique
   hotel. Imaginatively, many of the key features of the depot have been
   preserved – from the vaulted glass ceiling through to the rails in the
   dining-room floor – and the place has a really lively buzz. The hotel’s
   50-odd modern rooms and suites are spread over two floors around a
   spacious atrium.

   The four Amsterdam boutique hotels under the Conscious banner must
   surely be a signpost to the future, and their eco-conscious,
   sustainable credentials are a welcome development. Of the four, the
   Conscious Hotel Museum Square, near the Rijksmuseum, is perhaps the
   best located and claims to be 100 percent sustainable: the desks are
   made out of recycled yoghurt pots, there are ergonomic beds, the
   breakfasts are organic and there’s a living plant wall by the
   reception. An enjoyable place to stay – and one to ease your
   environmental conscience.

   For something completely different, Amsterdam offers the rare chance to
   sleep up an old crane in the former docklands that lie a quick ferry
   ride from the centre on the north side of the River IJ. In an
   extraordinary, award-winning conversion, the crane now holds three
   brightly decorated, deluxe suites perched at various levels up the
   crane, as well as a heated spa pool near the base. What’s more, if you
   want more high-flying excitement, you can even book a bungee jump.
