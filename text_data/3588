   Myanmar has called on its military to "launch operations" against
   ethnic Rakhine rebels behind a deadly attack on four police stations
   last week, a government spokesman said on January 7, as a surge of
   violence grips the restive western state. AFP

A New Dimension of Violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine State

   Ethnic Rakhine insurgents have attacked four police stations in
   Myanmar’s Rakhine State, provoking a military counteroffensive.
   Escalation could imperil both prospects for Rohingya repatriation and
   the country’s transition toward civilian rule. All sides should step
   back from confrontation and pursue talks about Rakhine State’s future.

   What’s new? Arakan Army attacks on remote police outposts in Myanmar’s
   northern Rakhine State left thirteen officers dead, prompting the
   government to order military “clearance operations” against the ethnic
   Rakhine insurgents. The looming violent escalation will be difficult to
   reverse – and will complicate efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees
   to Myanmar.

   Why did it happen? Despite the main ethnic Rakhine party’s election
   victory in 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi installed a minority National League
   for Democracy government in the state and the government imprisoned a
   popular Rakhine politician on high treason charges. These actions
   fuelled the belief among ethnic Rakhine that politics is failing them.

   Why does it matter? Rising violence in Rakhine State will deepen the
   longstanding political crisis there and undermine prospects for the
   repatriation of Rohingya refugees. It will also impede Myanmar’s
   broader peace process and political transition.

   What should be done? The military, government and insurgents should
   exercise restraint and seek a negotiated solution to the violence to
   avoid further inflaming ethnic tensions. China should work to bring all
   sides to the negotiating table. The government should initiate dialogue
   with ethnic Rakhine representatives over key political, economic and
   social issues.

I. Overview

   On 4 January – Myanmar’s Independence Day – the Arakan Army (AA), an
   ethnic Rakhine group, launched coordinated attacks on four police
   outposts in northern Rakhine State, killing thirteen officers and
   injuring nine others. The attacks followed months of low-grade violence
   in the state, including a roadside bomb attributed to the AA that
   struck the chief minister’s convoy but did little damage. The
   government has directed the military to launch “clearance operations”
   against the group, which will likely precipitate further violence and
   civilian casualties. Thousands of civilians have already fled villages
   near the raided outposts. The attacks signify a dangerous shift from
   politics to insurgency as the means of addressing ethnic Rakhine
   grievances. The state is already afflicted by the Rohingya mass flight;
   an escalated fight between ethnic Rakhine and the government would
   represent a blow to Myanmar’s political transition to civilian rule and
   be difficult to stop. All sides should step back from confrontation and
   instead discuss how best to address Rakhine grievances through
   political channels.

   The spotlight on the emergence of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army
   (ARSA) in 2016-2017, and the subsequent persecution and exodus of more
   than 800,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh, has obscured the three-way
   nature of the conflict in Rakhine State. The ethnic Rakhine, who are
   often portrayed as aggressors toward the Rohingya, have themselves been
   victims of neglect and oppression by ethnic Burman-controlled central
   governments for generations. Rakhine grievances against the ethnic
   Burman majority run deep, yet often go unacknowledged in assessments of
   the conflict in Rakhine State.
   " Renewed violence in northern Rakhine State will further diminish
   prospects for large-scale repatriation of Rohingya refugees. "

   Historically, the Rakhine have not had a powerful ethnic Rakhine
   insurgent group to give expression to their political aspirations, but
   since 2014 the AA has emerged to fill this perceived void in Rakhine
   State. A series of developments in Rakhine State over the past five
   years, including the ARSA attacks against state security forces in
   northern Rakhine State in 2016-2017 and political tensions between
   leading ethnic Rakhine figures and Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League
   for Democracy (NLD) government, has allowed the AA to gain a foothold
   in Rakhine, both militarily and politically.

   The consequences of the Independence Day attacks are likely to be
   serious. Renewed violence in northern Rakhine State will further
   diminish prospects for large-scale repatriation of Rohingya refugees.
   The attacks may also jeopardise prospects for progress in the peace
   process just weeks after Myanmar’s military announced an unprecedented
   unilateral ceasefire. Although that ceasefire did not cover Rakhine
   State, ostensibly because of operations against ARSA, the AA had
   recently made a significant peace overture to the government. The
   violence is also likely to heighten tensions between ethnic Rakhine and
   Burman political actors at both the state and national levels. The NLD
   government’s immediate response, to declare the AA “terrorists”, has
   only exacerbated these tensions.

   The military should exercise restraint in its response to the attacks,
   avoiding the violence against civilians that precipitated the flight of
   Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh, while the AA should refrain from
   further aggression targeting either the military or civilians. China
   ought to try to use its influence over the peace process to bring the
   AA and the government to the negotiating table. It should also
   encourage the military to expand its unilateral ceasefire to explicitly
   include Rakhine State. The government should initiate a dialogue about
   how best to address current tensions and future political aspirations
   with ethnic Rakhine political parties and other communal
   representatives.

II. Raising the Stakes

   Shortly before 7am on 4 January, the AA launched coordinated attacks on
   four Border Guard Police outposts in a remote area of northern Rakhine
   State’s Buthidaung township, close to the border with Bangladesh.
   Government reports state that the AA sent around 350 heavily armed
   fighters to raid the posts, which were only lightly defended. The
   defenders were forced to abandon two of the outposts but held out for
   several hours at the other two with the help of artillery and air
   support. They were eventually relieved by Border Guard and army
   reinforcements, after which AA fighters withdrew. The raiders killed
   thirteen officers and injured nine; they also seized 40 weapons and
   more than 16,000 rounds of ammunition.^[fn]“AA launches massive
   coordinated attacks on four border police outposts in Buthidaung
   township, leaves 9 injured, 13 police personnel killed”, Global New
   Light of Myanmar, 5 January 2019.Hide Footnote A day later, the group
   released fourteen police officers and four civilians whom it had
   captured in the fighting.

   The military and police had received warnings that attacks were
   planned, but appeared unprepared for the scale of the
   offensive.^[fn]Crisis Group interviews, political analysts involved in
   the peace process, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote One Border Guard
   Police commander described it as “stabbing us in the back”, suggesting
   that the AA should view ARSA as the common enemy and refrain from
   undermining government efforts to contain the Muslim group.^[fn]“AA
   backstabbed gov’t forces in Jan 4 attacks: Border guard officer”, The
   Irrawaddy, 7 January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Rather than leave the response to the military, the government took the
   initiative by calling a rare high-level meeting of senior military and
   civilian officials on 7 January.^[fn]Although this meeting featured all
   eleven members of the National Defence and Security Council, the NLD
   government did not publicly describe it as a council meeting. It also
   included additional actors, including four government ministers, the
   head of the Peace Commission and the chief of Military Affairs
   Security. The government has yet to call a council meeting since taking
   office, something for which the military has criticised it.Hide
   Footnote It ordered “clearance operations” targeting the AA – the first
   time the NLD administration had publicly issued a command to the
   military regarding military operations. Speaking to the media after the
   7 January meeting, government spokesman Zaw Htay said President Win
   Myint had directed the military to “crush the terrorists”.^[fn]At an 18
   January press conference, a military spokesman claimed that during the
   7 January meeting Aung San Suu Kyi “instructed us to effectively crush
   the AA and if not, there will be finger-pointing that [the Myanmar
   military] does not crush the AA as it is an ethnic group, but it
   crushed ARSA, who practice a different religion.” See “AA must give up
   goal of confederation: Myanmar military”, The Irrawaddy, 18 January
   2019.Hide Footnote In an apparent attempt to discredit the AA among
   ethnic Rakhine, Zaw Htay accused the group of having links to ARSA,
   saying it was operating two bases inside Bangladesh. He suggested
   foreign powers were behind the fighting, warning the Rakhine people:

     Do they want to see a cycle of violence lasting decades? … I want to
     tell the Rakhine people who are supporting [the AA]: Don’t think
     about yourself, but think about your next generation.^[fn]“Myanmar’s
     civilian, military leaders meet, vow to ‘crush’ Rakhine rebels”,
     Reuters, 7 January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Although similar language has been deployed in the fight against ARSA,
   it is highly unusual in the context of an armed organisation like the
   AA that is affiliated with a recognised ethnic group such as the
   Rakhine.^[fn]The government officially recognises 135 ethnic groups as
   indigenous. This category does not include most people of Chinese or
   South Asian descent, including the Rohingya.Hide Footnote The
   government’s response risks inflaming an already tense situation,
   widening ethnic divisions between the Rakhine and the Burmans and
   encouraging increasing numbers of ethnic Rakhine people to voice
   support for the AA. It is also a risky strategy to order the military
   response, as it means the government will be to some extent responsible
   for the conduct and consequences of military operations against the AA.

   The Myanmar military has reportedly moved troops from two light
   infantry divisions to the conflict zone and captured one AA temporary
   outpost in Buthidaung township.^[fn]“A new war rages in Myanmar”, Asia
   Times, 15 January 2019.Hide Footnote The military claims that it killed
   thirteen AA soldiers between 5-16 January, but refused to divulge its
   own losses.^[fn]“AA must give up goal of confederation: Myanmar
   military”, The Irrawaddy, 18 January 2019.Hide Footnote While further
   conflict is expected, the AA is anticipated to pull back in the coming
   months because its supply lines are stretched and the dry season will
   be drawing to a close.^[fn]Crisis Group interview, political analyst
   involved in the peace process, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote The
   military may instead focus its attention on civilians, seeking to
   undermine support for the AA by making large-scale
   arrests.^[fn]Ibid.Hide Footnote In a further concerning development for
   stability in Rakhine State, a 16 January ambush on Border Guard Police
   in Maungdaw township that left six officers injured was initially
   blamed on the AA but later attributed to ARSA after a video of the
   incident was posted to social media, apparently by the Muslim
   group.^[fn]“Fresh ARSA attack injured six police officers”, The
   Irrawaddy, 20 January 2019.Hide Footnote If ARSA is indeed responsible,
   as appears likely, it would be the group’s first significant attack in
   more than a year.
   " The toll on civilians has been steep, with at least 4,500 people
   forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in monasteries. "

   The immediate trigger for the AA attacks is not entirely clear. One
   factor may have been the Myanmar military’s declaration of a unilateral
   ceasefire on 21 December that covered five regional military commands
   in Kachin and Shan states through 30 April 2019. Although the military
   said it did not include Rakhine State because of the need to continue
   operations against ARSA, the AA appears to believe that the purpose was
   instead to redirect troops from Shan and Kachin states against it. AA
   leader Tun Myat Naing said his soldiers had targeted police posts
   because the Border Police had been working with the Myanmar military to
   carry out its “four cuts” counter-insurgency strategy against AA
   forces.^[fn]The authorities developed the “four cuts” strategy in the
   1970s, with the aim of cutting off insurgents’ access to food, funds,
   recruits and intelligence.Hide Footnote The goal of the AA attacks
   seems to be to establish a foothold in northern Rakhine State and
   solidify support among Rakhine people, thus strengthening the AA’s
   position in any future peace negotiations. “They feel this is their
   moment to push”, said one source involved in the peace process with
   close ties to AA officials.^[fn]Crisis Group interview, source close to
   the AA, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote

   In response, the EU’s Myanmar delegation issued a statement “deploring”
   the attacks but also acknowledging the “deep-rooted historical
   grievances in Rakhine State [that] can only be solved through dialogue
   and an inclusive political process”. The EU representatives called on
   the Tatmadaw to expand its unilateral ceasefire to Rakhine
   State.^[fn]“Local EU Statement on the Escalation of Violence in Rakhine
   State”, Delegation of the European Union to Myanmar, Yangon, 10 January
   2019.Hide Footnote China said it “supports the efforts by the Myanmar
   side to maintain peace and stability” and called for restraint and the
   resolution of “relevant issues through dialogue and
   consultation”.^[fn]“Chinese Embassy’s Statement on the Violence in
   Rakhine State”, Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the
   Republic of the Union of Myanmar, 5 January 2019.Hide Footnote

   The toll on civilians has been steep, with at least 4,500 people forced
   to flee their homes and seek shelter in monasteries, where they are
   receiving aid from the government, International Committee of the Red
   Cross (ICRC), civil society groups and local residents.^[fn]“Asia and
   the Pacific: Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot (1-7 Jan 2019)”, UN
   Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 7 January
   2019.Hide Footnote On 10 January, the Rakhine State government issued
   an order banning all UN agencies and international and local NGOs from
   visiting five conflict-affected townships, except for the ICRC and
   World Food Programme.^[fn]“Aid groups barred from Rakhine conflict
   zones”, The Myanmar Times, 14 January 2019.Hide Footnote Local media
   has also reported that the military has blocked attempts by Rakhine
   NGOs to send food shipments to displaced people.^[fn]“Concern mounts
   for IDPs in northern Rakhine as army blocks aid shipments”, The
   Irrawaddy, 9 January 2019.Hide Footnote

III. A Building Storm

   The attacks underline the Arakan Army’s growing military capability,
   which is built on rising popular support among ethnic Rakhine that has
   helped fill its coffers and swell its numbers with new recruits. Its
   growth has occurred in a short time. The AA was formed in 2009 at the
   Kachin Independence Army (KIA) headquarters in Laiza. In 1994, the KIA
   had signed a ceasefire with the military government, but fifteen years
   later it sensed that the accord was on the verge of collapse.^[fn]See
   Crisis Group Asia Briefing N°140, A Tentative Peace in Myanmar’s Kachin
   Conflict, 12 June 2013, Section III.C.Hide Footnote It had expected to
   keep its arms and autonomy under the truce, but the government was
   pressing it to become a Border Guard Force under the military’s
   command. As an insurance policy in the event of renewed fighting, the
   KIA sponsored the establishment of two proxies, the AA and Ta’ang
   National Liberation Army, supplying them with arms from its weapons
   factory.^[fn]The ceasefire did break down in June 2011, and the KIA
   remains in conflict with the Myanmar military. Ibid.Hide Footnote

   The AA mostly confined itself to KIA territory until around 2014, when
   it began to infiltrate southern Chin State and, later, far northern
   Rakhine State, resulting in sporadic clashes with state forces. From
   these remote areas its soldiers have reportedly encroached southward
   over the past year, into the fringes of Buthidaung, Ponnagyun,
   Rathedaung and Kyauktaw townships.^[fn]“Analysis: Arakan Army – A
   powerful new threat to the Tatmadaw”, The Irrawaddy, 8 January
   2019.Hide Footnote
   " The NLD’s ascension to power has only aggravated the underlying
   grievances. "

          + Facebook
          + Email

   A number of factors, both historical and recent, are fuelling this
   support for the AA. The Rakhine have grievances against the ethnic
   Burman majority that date back centuries, to the fall of the kingdom of
   Mrauk-U in 1784, and they blame central government neglect and lack of
   political autonomy for the state’s deep poverty. Many Rakhine view the
   Burmans as the bigger enemy than Muslims in the state, something that
   the government and many other Burman political actors do not
   acknowledge or are unwilling to address. The Rakhine are perhaps less
   wary of open war than other ethnic groups in the country, having no
   recent experience of armed conflict with the government, due to the
   lack of a strong ethnic armed group. In some quarters, there is even a
   palpable sense of excitement about the AA’s exploits.^[fn]This
   sentiment is very clear on social media. For more detailed discussion
   of Rakhine grievances, see Crisis Group Asia Report N°261, The Politics
   of Rakhine State, 22 October 2014.Hide Footnote

   The NLD’s ascension to power has only aggravated the underlying
   grievances. Under President Thein Sein, the government made some effort
   to consult Rakhine political leaders and include them in
   decision-making. It also used economic concessions strategically to
   create alliances. In contrast, the NLD ignored demands from the Arakan
   National Party – which won a clear majority of elected seats in the
   state in 2015 elections – to be given the chief minister position,
   instead appointing a relatively weak NLD member to the post. Following
   the ARSA attacks in 2016-2017 and subsequent flight of 800,000 Rohingya
   Muslims, the central government has moved to assert further control
   over executive functions in Rakhine, rendering the state government
   largely powerless and sidelining the legislature.

   Several events in 2018 proved particularly significant. On 16 January,
   police opened fire on a group of protesters in Mrauk-U, seat of the
   ancient Rakhine kingdom that fell to the Burmans, killing seven people
   and injuring a dozen more. The protest came after the township
   administrator cancelled a planned ceremony to mark the anniversary of
   the fall of the Rakhine kingdom, incensing the large crowd that had
   gathered in the town. Two days later, the state’s leading politician,
   Dr Aye Maung, was arrested in Sittwe together with a popular writer and
   civil society activist, Wai Hin Aung. Aye Maung remains on trial and
   faces a potential death sentence for high treason and incitement, after
   giving a speech shortly before the 16 January clash in which he
   allegedly said the Burmans consider the Rakhine slaves and expressed
   support for armed struggle to establish greater sovereignty for the
   Rakhine people.

   The arrest of Aye Maung and infighting within the Arakan National Party
   has left a leadership vacuum that the AA has quickly filled. With no
   clear political path to addressing their grievances, many Rakhine
   people increasingly see armed struggle as the more effective response
   to perceived Burman oppression.

   The AA has cleverly sought to leverage grievances through both online
   and other activities, such as the #ArakanDream2020 social media
   campaign and t-shirts emblazoned with “The Way of Rakhita”, the name
   that the group has given to its project of nationwide armed
   “revolution”.^[fn]“Myanmar’s Rakhine torched anew by insurgent fire”,
   Asia Times, 3 January 2019.Hide Footnote Videos on social media tout
   the group’s growing military prowess, including expensive weaponry that
   gives the AA greater operational capabilities.^[fn]See, for example,
   “Welcome to the 9th anniversary of Arakan Army Day”, video, YouTube, 6
   April 2018.Hide Footnote In addition to generating grassroots support,
   the AA political leadership, particularly Tun Myat Naing, has used
   social and mainstream media to articulate sophisticated political
   positions that appeal to educated Rakhine. The group has also used fear
   as a tactic, threatening township administrators and other government
   officials seen as obstructing AA activities.^[fn]Photos of threatening
   letters accompanied by bullets sent to government officials regularly
   circulate on social media. The AA does not deny sending them. See, for
   example, “AA issues threatening letters to Rakhine police, village
   head”, The Irrawaddy, 22 December 2018.Hide Footnote
   " The 4 January attacks and government response have changed the
   dynamic of armed conflict in Rakhine State by activating previously
   latent support for the AA and bringing such support more into the open.

   The AA also has been actively recruiting in Rakhine State, where young
   men who would once have opted to migrate from the area in search of
   work opportunities are instead enlisting.^[fn]Studies report that up to
   80 per cent of young people in some Rakhine State townships have
   migrated to other states and regions in Myanmar or abroad, mostly to
   find jobs. See “IOM appeal (Myanmar/Rakhine State) (April 2016-April
   2018)”, International Organization for Migration, 15 March 2016.Hide
   Footnote The large Rakhine communities in Kachin State and Yangon are
   another important source of fighters; the militia is quite openly using
   some Rakhine Buddhist monasteries and Rakhine-owned businesses in
   Yangon, for example, as recruiting offices.^[fn]Crisis Group interview,
   political analyst involved in the peace process, Yangon, January
   2019.Hide Footnote Meanwhile, migrant workers in Thailand and Malaysia
   are sending money to the AA, either through relatives in Rakhine State
   or bank accounts in China, and the group often boasts of donations from
   Rakhine business people.^[fn]Crisis Group interviews, Rakhine
   journalist and political analysts involved in the peace process,
   January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Although the AA denies it, the group – like nearly all armed groups in
   Myanmar – appears to be profiting from the drug trade. In early 2016,
   the government said it had arrested an AA officer in Yangon, impounding
   large quantities of weapons, ammunition and drugs.^[fn]“How to fund a
   war – Arakan Army officer arrested with guns, drugs in Yangon”, Global
   New Light of Myanmar, 28 February 2016.Hide Footnote  A record drug
   seizure of 2.67 tonnes of methamphetamine tablets the previous July had
   been linked to Rakhine merchants.^[fn]“Police searching for six
   suspects over record US$106 million drug haul”, The Myanmar Times, 19
   August 2015.Hide Footnote Most of the drugs are destined for
   Bangladesh, but in Rakhine State, methamphetamine pills known as yaba
   have also become much more widely available over the past two years. In
   some areas, powdered yaba is now sold openly in a package with areca
   nut for as little as 25 U.S. cents.^[fn]A whole tablet costs 4,000
   Myanmar kyat, or around $2.50. Crisis Group interview, Rakhine
   journalist, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote

   The 4 January attacks and government response have changed the dynamic
   of armed conflict in Rakhine State by activating previously latent
   support for the AA and bringing such support more into the open.
   Although Rakhine communities may eventually tire of conflict and the
   negative consequences it brings, in the short term such conflict and
   the military abuse of civilians that invariably accompanies it will
   likely spur further backing for the AA. The conflict has entered a
   dangerous new phase in which ethnic divisions have more clearly been
   brought to the fore.

   The consequences of a rift between Rakhine and Burman people could be
   far-reaching, given that there is a quite prominent Rakhine elite
   within national institutions, including military, government and civil
   service as well as civil society and the Buddhist monkhood. Specific
   examples of how this is already playing out are starting to be seen.
   When the upper Myanmar branch of the influential Buddhist nationalist
   organisation MaBaTha issued a statement condemning the 4 January
   attacks, the Rakhine branch responded by questioning why it had said
   nothing when police shot seven Rakhine demonstrators in Mrauk-U a year
   earlier.^[fn]“Opinion statement”, MaBaTha (Upper Myanmar), 6 January
   2019, and “Objection statement”, MaBaTha (Rakhine State), 11 January
   2019.Hide Footnote And as one ethnic Rakhine journalist explained, even
   Rakhine in Yangon who interact with ethnic Burmans on a daily basis are
   now publicly expressing their anger toward the majority group, “so you
   can imagine what the feeling is like in areas that are almost
   exclusively Rakhine”.^[fn]Crisis Group interview, Rakhine journalist,
   Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote

IV. Peace and Repatriation

   The 4 January attacks present a fresh challenge for both Myanmar’s
   national peace process and government plans to repatriate some of the
   more than 800,000 Rohingya who have fled from Rakhine State to
   Bangladesh since 2016. The most immediate impact will be on the
   long-stalled peace process, particularly the government’s efforts to
   convene a 21st Century Panglong Union Peace Conference in February.
   This series of conferences would bring together non-state armed groups
   that signed the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, the military, the
   government, members of parliament, representatives of political parties
   and civil society leaders in political dialogue aimed at drafting a
   Union Peace Accord that would create a federal political system. A
   conference is supposed to be held every six months, but since the NLD
   took office nearly three years ago only three have taken place.
   Non-signatories, such as the AA, can only attend as observers – if
   invited at all – and are not able to participate in decision-making.

   Prior to 4 January, new momentum appeared to be developing, largely as
   a result of Chinese efforts to push the process forward in support of
   its economic ambitions, manifest in the Belt and Road Initiative. On 12
   December, the AA and Ta’ang National Liberation Army – together with a
   third group, the ethnic Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance
   Army – said they would halt military operations and wanted to solve
   their political conflicts through dialogue. The government’s peace
   commission immediately accepted this overture and shortly afterward the
   military announced its unilateral ceasefire. Observers considered this
   development an important step forward, because for several years the
   three groups had been on the fringes of the peace process due to the
   military’s insistence that they surrender and disarm.^[fn]Crisis Group
   interview, political analyst involved in the peace process, Yangon,
   January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Myanmar’s ethnic armed organisations can be broadly split into two
   groups: those that have signed the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement
   and those that have not. Of the latter, seven (including the AA) are in
   a coalition known as the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative
   Committee that the United Wa State Army set up in 2017.^[fn]For
   detailed discussion, see Crisis Group Asia Report N°287, Building
   Critical Mass for Peace in Myanmar, 29 June 2017.Hide Footnote The
   groups within this bloc exhibit a high degree of solidarity and are
   unlikely to proceed with peace negotiations if the AA is excluded as a
   result of the 4 January attacks. Despite the government’s rhetoric
   about crushing the AA, it thus has little choice but to seek
   negotiations with the group in the longer term.^[fn]A similar scenario
   played out after the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army’s
   offensive in the Kokang region of Shan State in February 2015.Hide
   Footnote
   " Despite the strong negative sentiment the Rohingya issue arouses
   among the ethnic Rakhine, the AA has taken a relatively moderate line.
   "
     *

          + Facebook
          + Email

   Whether the AA will be willing to refrain from further attacks in the
   short term is unclear. Tun Myat Naing’s increasingly bold statements
   will make it politically difficult for him to agree to do so; if he is
   seen as having been forced to back down it could undermine the AA’s
   growing support. In recent weeks, Tun Myat Naing has also articulated a
   vision for Rakhine State that the government could find difficult to
   accommodate within the peace process. The nationwide ceasefire aims to
   establish a democratic federal union, with more political power
   devolved to ethnic minority areas. But Tun Myat Naing has called for
   what he describes as “confederate” status for Rakhine State, under
   which it would have almost complete autonomy, except in defence, trade
   regulation and foreign affairs.^[fn]“Confederation the only option for
   Arakanese people, AA chief says”, The Irrawaddy, 11 January 2019.Hide
   Footnote

    The 4 January attacks will also further complicate the government’s
   hopes for beginning the long-delayed repatriation of thousands of
   Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.^[fn]See Crisis Group Asia Briefing
   N°153, Bangladesh-Myanmar: The Danger of Forced Repatriation, 12
   November 2018.Hide Footnote

   Despite the strong negative sentiment the Rohingya issue arouses among
   the ethnic Rakhine, the AA has taken a relatively moderate line,
   suggesting that the government promptly grant citizenship rights to
   those who are repatriated if they are found to be eligible under the
   1982 Citizenship Law.^[fn]“AA leader dismisses ‘ridiculous’ claim that
   his group has ties to ARSA”, The Irrawaddy, 11 April 2018. For detailed
   discussion of the 1982 Citizenship Law, see Crisis Group Report, The
   Politics of Rakhine State, op. cit., pp. 10-11.Hide Footnote
   Citizenship rights would in theory allow the repatriated Rohingya to
   move freely around the country, for instance migrating to large cities
   in search of jobs. For decades, most Rohingya have been issued only
   temporary identity papers instead of citizenship documents, conferring
   them fewer rights and strictly limiting travel within Myanmar. Many
   ethnic Rakhine consider this restriction on the Rohingya to be an
   unfair burden on themselves as well, because it means the Rohingya have
   no option but to compete with them for employment and resources in
   Rakhine State. The AA’s line thus reflects the formal position of many
   Rakhine politicians.^[fn]See Crisis Group Report, The Politics of
   Rakhine State, op. cit., pp. 14-18.Hide Footnote The subtext is that
   both the Rakhine and Rohingya are victims of the Burman-controlled
   state, and that focusing on each other plays into the central
   government’s divide-and-rule tactics.

   The instability generated as a result of the 4 January attacks and any
   subsequent fighting in the months ahead will diminish the already slim
   chances of repatriation getting underway. Security restrictions,
   particularly on access for UN agencies and NGOs, will alarm any
   Rohingya possibly considering returning under the repatriation scheme,
   and could result in further hardship for the estimated 200,000 who have
   stayed behind in northern Rakhine State. Regardless of the AA’s
   position, the ethno-nationalist sentiment whipped up among ethnic
   Rakhine will also create further caution among potential returnees,
   many of whom have already objected to coming back due to security
   concerns and lack of clarity over citizenship.^[fn]“Repatriation plan
   stalls as Rohingya refuse to return to Myanmar”, Catholic News Service,
   15 November 2018.Hide Footnote

V. Conclusion

   The AA attacks on 4 January were a provocative step that asserted the
   group’s growing military capabilities and popular support among Rakhine
   people. There is a serious risk that an escalatory dynamic takes hold,
   which could plunge the state deeper into armed conflict. Preventing
   escalation will require the AA to refrain from further attacks, and the
   government and military to resist the urge to retaliate politically and
   militarily. Escalation would fuel support for the AA and reinforce
   ethnic divisions between the Rakhine and the Burman majority. The
   military should exercise restraint in its “clearance operations”,
   avoiding the harm to civilians that regularly mars its
   counter-insurgency activity, and expand the unilateral ceasefire to
   encompass Rakhine State. The government should make overtures to the AA
   through informal channels and encourage other peace stakeholders with
   leverage over the AA to bring the ethnic Rakhine insurgents to the
   negotiating table. Further, all sides should avoid rhetoric that could
   further inflame ethnic tensions.
   " The government needs to begin a genuine and inclusive dialogue with
   the Rakhine people. "

   China has an important role to play. Its growing influence within the
   peace process became increasingly clear through 2018, and in December
   it helped convene a meeting of the AA, Ta’ang National Liberation Army
   and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army at which they expressed
   support for dialogue with the government. Its ability to pressure the
   AA may be limited because of the lack of cultural ties between the
   Rakhine and Chinese, and Rakhine State’s distance from China’s border,
   but it can still exercise influence by proxy through the AA’s key
   allies, including the Kachin and Wa armed groups.

   Most importantly, the government needs to begin a genuine and inclusive
   dialogue with the Rakhine people, including the state’s political
   actors, regarding the state’s future political, economic and social
   trajectory. In particular, this dialogue should cover the repatriation
   process, rebuilding Rohingya communities, economic development and
   power sharing between the central and state governments.^[fn]The
   importance of including the Rakhine community in state-level
   decision-making was emphasised in the final report of the Advisory
   Commission on Rakhine State chaired by the late Dr Kofi Annan.Hide
   Footnote As a gesture of good-will, and to kick-start this dialogue,
   the government should consider releasing Aye Maung and other ethnic
   Rakhine political prisoners. It is only through political inclusion
   that Myanmar can avert a further strengthening of the ethnic Rakhine
   insurgency.

A New Dimension of Violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine State

   Ethnic Rakhine insurgents have attacked four police stations in
   Myanmar’s Rakhine State, provoking a military counteroffensive.
   Escalation could imperil both prospects for Rohingya repatriation and
   the country’s transition toward civilian rule. All sides should step
   back from confrontation and pursue talks about Rakhine State’s future.

   What’s new? Arakan Army attacks on remote police outposts in Myanmar’s
   northern Rakhine State left thirteen officers dead, prompting the
   government to order military “clearance operations” against the ethnic
   Rakhine insurgents. The looming violent escalation will be difficult to
   reverse – and will complicate efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees
   to Myanmar.

   Why did it happen? Despite the main ethnic Rakhine party’s election
   victory in 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi installed a minority National League
   for Democracy government in the state and the government imprisoned a
   popular Rakhine politician on high treason charges. These actions
   fuelled the belief among ethnic Rakhine that politics is failing them.

   Why does it matter? Rising violence in Rakhine State will deepen the
   longstanding political crisis there and undermine prospects for the
   repatriation of Rohingya refugees. It will also impede Myanmar’s
   broader peace process and political transition.

   What should be done? The military, government and insurgents should
   exercise restraint and seek a negotiated solution to the violence to
   avoid further inflaming ethnic tensions. China should work to bring all
   sides to the negotiating table. The government should initiate dialogue
   with ethnic Rakhine representatives over key political, economic and
   social issues.

I. Overview

   On 4 January – Myanmar’s Independence Day – the Arakan Army (AA), an
   ethnic Rakhine group, launched coordinated attacks on four police
   outposts in northern Rakhine State, killing thirteen officers and
   injuring nine others. The attacks followed months of low-grade violence
   in the state, including a roadside bomb attributed to the AA that
   struck the chief minister’s convoy but did little damage. The
   government has directed the military to launch “clearance operations”
   against the group, which will likely precipitate further violence and
   civilian casualties. Thousands of civilians have already fled villages
   near the raided outposts. The attacks signify a dangerous shift from
   politics to insurgency as the means of addressing ethnic Rakhine
   grievances. The state is already afflicted by the Rohingya mass flight;
   an escalated fight between ethnic Rakhine and the government would
   represent a blow to Myanmar’s political transition to civilian rule and
   be difficult to stop. All sides should step back from confrontation and
   instead discuss how best to address Rakhine grievances through
   political channels.

   The spotlight on the emergence of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army
   (ARSA) in 2016-2017, and the subsequent persecution and exodus of more
   than 800,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh, has obscured the three-way
   nature of the conflict in Rakhine State. The ethnic Rakhine, who are
   often portrayed as aggressors toward the Rohingya, have themselves been
   victims of neglect and oppression by ethnic Burman-controlled central
   governments for generations. Rakhine grievances against the ethnic
   Burman majority run deep, yet often go unacknowledged in assessments of
   the conflict in Rakhine State.

   Historically, the Rakhine have not had a powerful ethnic Rakhine
   insurgent group to give expression to their political aspirations, but
   since 2014 the AA has emerged to fill this perceived void in Rakhine
   State. A series of developments in Rakhine State over the past five
   years, including the ARSA attacks against state security forces in
   northern Rakhine State in 2016-2017 and political tensions between
   leading ethnic Rakhine figures and Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League
   for Democracy (NLD) government, has allowed the AA to gain a foothold
   in Rakhine, both militarily and politically.

   The consequences of the Independence Day attacks are likely to be
   serious. Renewed violence in northern Rakhine State will further
   diminish prospects for large-scale repatriation of Rohingya refugees.
   The attacks may also jeopardise prospects for progress in the peace
   process just weeks after Myanmar’s military announced an unprecedented
   unilateral ceasefire. Although that ceasefire did not cover Rakhine
   State, ostensibly because of operations against ARSA, the AA had
   recently made a significant peace overture to the government. The
   violence is also likely to heighten tensions between ethnic Rakhine and
   Burman political actors at both the state and national levels. The NLD
   government’s immediate response, to declare the AA “terrorists”, has
   only exacerbated these tensions.

   The military should exercise restraint in its response to the attacks,
   avoiding the violence against civilians that precipitated the flight of
   Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh, while the AA should refrain from
   further aggression targeting either the military or civilians. China
   ought to try to use its influence over the peace process to bring the
   AA and the government to the negotiating table. It should also
   encourage the military to expand its unilateral ceasefire to explicitly
   include Rakhine State. The government should initiate a dialogue about
   how best to address current tensions and future political aspirations
   with ethnic Rakhine political parties and other communal
   representatives.

II. Raising the Stakes

   Shortly before 7am on 4 January, the AA launched coordinated attacks on
   four Border Guard Police outposts in a remote area of northern Rakhine
   State’s Buthidaung township, close to the border with Bangladesh.
   Government reports state that the AA sent around 350 heavily armed
   fighters to raid the posts, which were only lightly defended. The
   defenders were forced to abandon two of the outposts but held out for
   several hours at the other two with the help of artillery and air
   support. They were eventually relieved by Border Guard and army
   reinforcements, after which AA fighters withdrew. The raiders killed
   thirteen officers and injured nine; they also seized 40 weapons and
   more than 16,000 rounds of ammunition.^[fn]“AA launches massive
   coordinated attacks on four border police outposts in Buthidaung
   township, leaves 9 injured, 13 police personnel killed”, Global New
   Light of Myanmar, 5 January 2019.Hide Footnote A day later, the group
   released fourteen police officers and four civilians whom it had
   captured in the fighting.

   The military and police had received warnings that attacks were
   planned, but appeared unprepared for the scale of the
   offensive.^[fn]Crisis Group interviews, political analysts involved in
   the peace process, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote One Border Guard
   Police commander described it as “stabbing us in the back”, suggesting
   that the AA should view ARSA as the common enemy and refrain from
   undermining government efforts to contain the Muslim group.^[fn]“AA
   backstabbed gov’t forces in Jan 4 attacks: Border guard officer”, The
   Irrawaddy, 7 January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Rather than leave the response to the military, the government took the
   initiative by calling a rare high-level meeting of senior military and
   civilian officials on 7 January.^[fn]Although this meeting featured all
   eleven members of the National Defence and Security Council, the NLD
   government did not publicly describe it as a council meeting. It also
   included additional actors, including four government ministers, the
   head of the Peace Commission and the chief of Military Affairs
   Security. The government has yet to call a council meeting since taking
   office, something for which the military has criticised it.Hide
   Footnote It ordered “clearance operations” targeting the AA – the first
   time the NLD administration had publicly issued a command to the
   military regarding military operations. Speaking to the media after the
   7 January meeting, government spokesman Zaw Htay said President Win
   Myint had directed the military to “crush the terrorists”.^[fn]At an 18
   January press conference, a military spokesman claimed that during the
   7 January meeting Aung San Suu Kyi “instructed us to effectively crush
   the AA and if not, there will be finger-pointing that [the Myanmar
   military] does not crush the AA as it is an ethnic group, but it
   crushed ARSA, who practice a different religion.” See “AA must give up
   goal of confederation: Myanmar military”, The Irrawaddy, 18 January
   2019.Hide Footnote In an apparent attempt to discredit the AA among
   ethnic Rakhine, Zaw Htay accused the group of having links to ARSA,
   saying it was operating two bases inside Bangladesh. He suggested
   foreign powers were behind the fighting, warning the Rakhine people:

     Do they want to see a cycle of violence lasting decades? … I want to
     tell the Rakhine people who are supporting [the AA]: Don’t think
     about yourself, but think about your next generation.^[fn]“Myanmar’s
     civilian, military leaders meet, vow to ‘crush’ Rakhine rebels”,
     Reuters, 7 January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Although similar language has been deployed in the fight against ARSA,
   it is highly unusual in the context of an armed organisation like the
   AA that is affiliated with a recognised ethnic group such as the
   Rakhine.^[fn]The government officially recognises 135 ethnic groups as
   indigenous. This category does not include most people of Chinese or
   South Asian descent, including the Rohingya.Hide Footnote The
   government’s response risks inflaming an already tense situation,
   widening ethnic divisions between the Rakhine and the Burmans and
   encouraging increasing numbers of ethnic Rakhine people to voice
   support for the AA. It is also a risky strategy to order the military
   response, as it means the government will be to some extent responsible
   for the conduct and consequences of military operations against the AA.

   The Myanmar military has reportedly moved troops from two light
   infantry divisions to the conflict zone and captured one AA temporary
   outpost in Buthidaung township.^[fn]“A new war rages in Myanmar”, Asia
   Times, 15 January 2019.Hide Footnote The military claims that it killed
   thirteen AA soldiers between 5-16 January, but refused to divulge its
   own losses.^[fn]“AA must give up goal of confederation: Myanmar
   military”, The Irrawaddy, 18 January 2019.Hide Footnote While further
   conflict is expected, the AA is anticipated to pull back in the coming
   months because its supply lines are stretched and the dry season will
   be drawing to a close.^[fn]Crisis Group interview, political analyst
   involved in the peace process, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote The
   military may instead focus its attention on civilians, seeking to
   undermine support for the AA by making large-scale
   arrests.^[fn]Ibid.Hide Footnote In a further concerning development for
   stability in Rakhine State, a 16 January ambush on Border Guard Police
   in Maungdaw township that left six officers injured was initially
   blamed on the AA but later attributed to ARSA after a video of the
   incident was posted to social media, apparently by the Muslim
   group.^[fn]“Fresh ARSA attack injured six police officers”, The
   Irrawaddy, 20 January 2019.Hide Footnote If ARSA is indeed responsible,
   as appears likely, it would be the group’s first significant attack in
   more than a year.

   The immediate trigger for the AA attacks is not entirely clear. One
   factor may have been the Myanmar military’s declaration of a unilateral
   ceasefire on 21 December that covered five regional military commands
   in Kachin and Shan states through 30 April 2019. Although the military
   said it did not include Rakhine State because of the need to continue
   operations against ARSA, the AA appears to believe that the purpose was
   instead to redirect troops from Shan and Kachin states against it. AA
   leader Tun Myat Naing said his soldiers had targeted police posts
   because the Border Police had been working with the Myanmar military to
   carry out its “four cuts” counter-insurgency strategy against AA
   forces.^[fn]The authorities developed the “four cuts” strategy in the
   1970s, with the aim of cutting off insurgents’ access to food, funds,
   recruits and intelligence.Hide Footnote The goal of the AA attacks
   seems to be to establish a foothold in northern Rakhine State and
   solidify support among Rakhine people, thus strengthening the AA’s
   position in any future peace negotiations. “They feel this is their
   moment to push”, said one source involved in the peace process with
   close ties to AA officials.^[fn]Crisis Group interview, source close to
   the AA, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote

   In response, the EU’s Myanmar delegation issued a statement “deploring”
   the attacks but also acknowledging the “deep-rooted historical
   grievances in Rakhine State [that] can only be solved through dialogue
   and an inclusive political process”. The EU representatives called on
   the Tatmadaw to expand its unilateral ceasefire to Rakhine
   State.^[fn]“Local EU Statement on the Escalation of Violence in Rakhine
   State”, Delegation of the European Union to Myanmar, Yangon, 10 January

   to flee their homes and seek shelter in monasteries, where they are
   receiving aid from the government, International Committee of the Red
   Cross (ICRC), civil society groups and local residents.^[fn]“Asia and

III. A Building Storm

   The attacks underline the Arakan Army’s growing military capability,
   which is built on rising popular support among ethnic Rakhine that has
   helped fill its coffers and swell its numbers with new recruits. Its
   growth has occurred in a short time. The AA was formed in 2009 at the
   Kachin Independence Army (KIA) headquarters in Laiza. In 1994, the KIA
   had signed a ceasefire with the military government, but fifteen years
   later it sensed that the accord was on the verge of collapse.^[fn]See
   Crisis Group Asia Briefing N°140, A Tentative Peace in Myanmar’s Kachin
   Conflict, 12 June 2013, Section III.C.Hide Footnote It had expected to
   keep its arms and autonomy under the truce, but the government was
   pressing it to become a Border Guard Force under the military’s
   command. As an insurance policy in the event of renewed fighting, the
   KIA sponsored the establishment of two proxies, the AA and Ta’ang
   National Liberation Army, supplying them with arms from its weapons
   factory.^[fn]The ceasefire did break down in June 2011, and the KIA
   remains in conflict with the Myanmar military. Ibid.Hide Footnote

   The AA mostly confined itself to KIA territory until around 2014, when
   it began to infiltrate southern Chin State and, later, far northern
   Rakhine State, resulting in sporadic clashes with state forces. From
   these remote areas its soldiers have reportedly encroached southward
   over the past year, into the fringes of Buthidaung, Ponnagyun,
   Rathedaung and Kyauktaw townships.^[fn]“Analysis: Arakan Army – A
   powerful new threat to the Tatmadaw”, The Irrawaddy, 8 January
   2019.Hide Footnote

   grievances. "

   A number of factors, both historical and recent, are fuelling this
   support for the AA. The Rakhine have grievances against the ethnic
   Burman majority that date back centuries, to the fall of the kingdom of
   Mrauk-U in 1784, and they blame central government neglect and lack of
   political autonomy for the state’s deep poverty. Many Rakhine view the
   Burmans as the bigger enemy than Muslims in the state, something that
   the government and many other Burman political actors do not
   acknowledge or are unwilling to address. The Rakhine are perhaps less
   wary of open war than other ethnic groups in the country, having no
   recent experience of armed conflict with the government, due to the
   lack of a strong ethnic armed group. In some quarters, there is even a
   palpable sense of excitement about the AA’s exploits.^[fn]This
   sentiment is very clear on social media. For more detailed discussion
   of Rakhine grievances, see Crisis Group Asia Report N°261, The Politics
   of Rakhine State, 22 October 2014.Hide Footnote

   The NLD’s ascension to power has only aggravated the underlying
   grievances. Under President Thein Sein, the government made some effort
   to consult Rakhine political leaders and include them in
   decision-making. It also used economic concessions strategically to
   create alliances. In contrast, the NLD ignored demands from the Arakan
   National Party – which won a clear majority of elected seats in the
   state in 2015 elections – to be given the chief minister position,
   instead appointing a relatively weak NLD member to the post. Following
   the ARSA attacks in 2016-2017 and subsequent flight of 800,000 Rohingya
   Muslims, the central government has moved to assert further control
   over executive functions in Rakhine, rendering the state government
   largely powerless and sidelining the legislature.

   Several events in 2018 proved particularly significant. On 16 January,
   police opened fire on a group of protesters in Mrauk-U, seat of the
   ancient Rakhine kingdom that fell to the Burmans, killing seven people
   and injuring a dozen more. The protest came after the township
   administrator cancelled a planned ceremony to mark the anniversary of
   the fall of the Rakhine kingdom, incensing the large crowd that had
   gathered in the town. Two days later, the state’s leading politician,
   Dr Aye Maung, was arrested in Sittwe together with a popular writer and
   civil society activist, Wai Hin Aung. Aye Maung remains on trial and
   faces a potential death sentence for high treason and incitement, after
   giving a speech shortly before the 16 January clash in which he
   allegedly said the Burmans consider the Rakhine slaves and expressed
   support for armed struggle to establish greater sovereignty for the
   Rakhine people.

   The arrest of Aye Maung and infighting within the Arakan National Party
   has left a leadership vacuum that the AA has quickly filled. With no
   clear political path to addressing their grievances, many Rakhine
   people increasingly see armed struggle as the more effective response
   to perceived Burman oppression.

   The AA has cleverly sought to leverage grievances through both online
   and other activities, such as the #ArakanDream2020 social media
   campaign and t-shirts emblazoned with “The Way of Rakhita”, the name
   that the group has given to its project of nationwide armed
   “revolution”.^[fn]“Myanmar’s Rakhine torched anew by insurgent fire”,
   Asia Times, 3 January 2019.Hide Footnote Videos on social media tout
   the group’s growing military prowess, including expensive weaponry that
   gives the AA greater operational capabilities.^[fn]See, for example,
   “Welcome to the 9th anniversary of Arakan Army Day”, video, YouTube, 6
   April 2018.Hide Footnote In addition to generating grassroots support,
   the AA political leadership, particularly Tun Myat Naing, has used
   social and mainstream media to articulate sophisticated political
   positions that appeal to educated Rakhine. The group has also used fear
   as a tactic, threatening township administrators and other government
   officials seen as obstructing AA activities.^[fn]Photos of threatening
   letters accompanied by bullets sent to government officials regularly
   circulate on social media. The AA does not deny sending them. See, for
   example, “AA issues threatening letters to Rakhine police, village
   head”, The Irrawaddy, 22 December 2018.Hide Footnote
   " The 4 January attacks and government response have changed the
   dynamic of armed conflict in Rakhine State by activating previously
   latent support for the AA and bringing such support more into the open.

   The AA also has been actively recruiting in Rakhine State, where young
   men who would once have opted to migrate from the area in search of
   work opportunities are instead enlisting.^[fn]Studies report that up to
   80 per cent of young people in some Rakhine State townships have
   migrated to other states and regions in Myanmar or abroad, mostly to
   find jobs. See “IOM appeal (Myanmar/Rakhine State) (April 2016-April
   2018)”, International Organization for Migration, 15 March 2016.Hide
   Footnote The large Rakhine communities in Kachin State and Yangon are
   another important source of fighters; the militia is quite openly using
   some Rakhine Buddhist monasteries and Rakhine-owned businesses in
   Yangon, for example, as recruiting offices.^[fn]Crisis Group interview,
   political analyst involved in the peace process, Yangon, January
   2019.Hide Footnote Meanwhile, migrant workers in Thailand and Malaysia
   are sending money to the AA, either through relatives in Rakhine State
   or bank accounts in China, and the group often boasts of donations from
   Rakhine business people.^[fn]Crisis Group interviews, Rakhine
   journalist and political analysts involved in the peace process,
   January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Although the AA denies it, the group – like nearly all armed groups in
   Myanmar – appears to be profiting from the drug trade. In early 2016,
   the government said it had arrested an AA officer in Yangon, impounding
   large quantities of weapons, ammunition and drugs.^[fn]“How to fund a
   war – Arakan Army officer arrested with guns, drugs in Yangon”, Global
   New Light of Myanmar, 28 February 2016.Hide Footnote  A record drug
   seizure of 2.67 tonnes of methamphetamine tablets the previous July had
   been linked to Rakhine merchants.^[fn]“Police searching for six
   suspects over record US$106 million drug haul”, The Myanmar Times, 19
   August 2015.Hide Footnote Most of the drugs are destined for
   Bangladesh, but in Rakhine State, methamphetamine pills known as yaba
   have also become much more widely available over the past two years. In
   some areas, powdered yaba is now sold openly in a package with areca
   nut for as little as 25 U.S. cents.^[fn]A whole tablet costs 4,000
   Myanmar kyat, or around $2.50. Crisis Group interview, Rakhine
   journalist, Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote

   The 4 January attacks and government response have changed the dynamic
   of armed conflict in Rakhine State by activating previously latent
   support for the AA and bringing such support more into the open.
   Although Rakhine communities may eventually tire of conflict and the
   negative consequences it brings, in the short term such conflict and
   the military abuse of civilians that invariably accompanies it will
   likely spur further backing for the AA. The conflict has entered a
   dangerous new phase in which ethnic divisions have more clearly been
   brought to the fore.

   The consequences of a rift between Rakhine and Burman people could be
   far-reaching, given that there is a quite prominent Rakhine elite
   within national institutions, including military, government and civil
   service as well as civil society and the Buddhist monkhood. Specific
   examples of how this is already playing out are starting to be seen.
   When the upper Myanmar branch of the influential Buddhist nationalist
   organisation MaBaTha issued a statement condemning the 4 January
   attacks, the Rakhine branch responded by questioning why it had said
   nothing when police shot seven Rakhine demonstrators in Mrauk-U a year
   earlier.^[fn]“Opinion statement”, MaBaTha (Upper Myanmar), 6 January
   2019, and “Objection statement”, MaBaTha (Rakhine State), 11 January

   Rakhine in Yangon who interact with ethnic Burmans on a daily basis are
   now publicly expressing their anger toward the majority group, “so you
   can imagine what the feeling is like in areas that are almost
   exclusively Rakhine”.^[fn]Crisis Group interview, Rakhine journalist,
   Yangon, January 2019.Hide Footnote

IV. Peace and Repatriation

   The 4 January attacks present a fresh challenge for both Myanmar’s
   national peace process and government plans to repatriate some of the
   more than 800,000 Rohingya who have fled from Rakhine State to
   Bangladesh since 2016. The most immediate impact will be on the
   long-stalled peace process, particularly the government’s efforts to
   convene a 21st Century Panglong Union Peace Conference in February.
   This series of conferences would bring together non-state armed groups
   that signed the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, the military, the
   government, members of parliament, representatives of political parties
   and civil society leaders in political dialogue aimed at drafting a
   Union Peace Accord that would create a federal political system. A
   conference is supposed to be held every six months, but since the NLD
   took office nearly three years ago only three have taken place.
   Non-signatories, such as the AA, can only attend as observers – if
   invited at all – and are not able to participate in decision-making.

   Prior to 4 January, new momentum appeared to be developing, largely as
   a result of Chinese efforts to push the process forward in support of
   its economic ambitions, manifest in the Belt and Road Initiative. On 12
   December, the AA and Ta’ang National Liberation Army – together with a
   third group, the ethnic Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance
   Army – said they would halt military operations and wanted to solve
   their political conflicts through dialogue. The government’s peace
   commission immediately accepted this overture and shortly afterward the
   military announced its unilateral ceasefire. Observers considered this
   development an important step forward, because for several years the
   three groups had been on the fringes of the peace process due to the
   military’s insistence that they surrender and disarm.^[fn]Crisis Group
   interview, political analyst involved in the peace process, Yangon,
   January 2019.Hide Footnote

   Myanmar’s ethnic armed organisations can be broadly split into two
   groups: those that have signed the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement
   and those that have not. Of the latter, seven (including the AA) are in
   a coalition known as the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative
   Committee that the United Wa State Army set up in 2017.^[fn]For
   detailed discussion, see Crisis Group Asia Report N°287, Building
   Critical Mass for Peace in Myanmar, 29 June 2017.Hide Footnote The
   groups within this bloc exhibit a high degree of solidarity and are
   unlikely to proceed with peace negotiations if the AA is excluded as a
   result of the 4 January attacks. Despite the government’s rhetoric
   about crushing the AA, it thus has little choice but to seek
   negotiations with the group in the longer term.^[fn]A similar scenario
   played out after the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army’s
   offensive in the Kokang region of Shan State in February 2015.Hide
   Footnote

   among the ethnic Rakhine, the AA has taken a relatively moderate line.

          + Email

   Whether the AA will be willing to refrain from further attacks in the
   short term is unclear. Tun Myat Naing’s increasingly bold statements
   will make it politically difficult for him to agree to do so; if he is
   seen as having been forced to back down it could undermine the AA’s
   growing support. In recent weeks, Tun Myat Naing has also articulated a
   vision for Rakhine State that the government could find difficult to
   accommodate within the peace process. The nationwide ceasefire aims to
   establish a democratic federal union, with more political power
   devolved to ethnic minority areas. But Tun Myat Naing has called for
   what he describes as “confederate” status for Rakhine State, under
   which it would have almost complete autonomy, except in defence, trade
   regulation and foreign affairs.^[fn]“Confederation the only option for
   Arakanese people, AA chief says”, The Irrawaddy, 11 January 2019.Hide
   Footnote

    The 4 January attacks will also further complicate the government’s
   hopes for beginning the long-delayed repatriation of thousands of
   Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.^[fn]See Crisis Group Asia Briefing
   N°153, Bangladesh-Myanmar: The Danger of Forced Repatriation, 12
   November 2018.Hide Footnote

   Despite the strong negative sentiment the Rohingya issue arouses among
   the ethnic Rakhine, the AA has taken a relatively moderate line,
   suggesting that the government promptly grant citizenship rights to
   those who are repatriated if they are found to be eligible under the
   1982 Citizenship Law.^[fn]“AA leader dismisses ‘ridiculous’ claim that
   his group has ties to ARSA”, The Irrawaddy, 11 April 2018. For detailed
   discussion of the 1982 Citizenship Law, see Crisis Group Report, The
   Politics of Rakhine State, op. cit., pp. 10-11.Hide Footnote
   Citizenship rights would in theory allow the repatriated Rohingya to
   move freely around the country, for instance migrating to large cities
   in search of jobs. For decades, most Rohingya have been issued only
   temporary identity papers instead of citizenship documents, conferring
   them fewer rights and strictly limiting travel within Myanmar. Many
   ethnic Rakhine consider this restriction on the Rohingya to be an
   unfair burden on themselves as well, because it means the Rohingya have
   no option but to compete with them for employment and resources in
   Rakhine State. The AA’s line thus reflects the formal position of many
   Rakhine politicians.^[fn]See Crisis Group Report, The Politics of
   Rakhine State, op. cit., pp. 14-18.Hide Footnote The subtext is that
   both the Rakhine and Rohingya are victims of the Burman-controlled
   state, and that focusing on each other plays into the central
   government’s divide-and-rule tactics.

   The instability generated as a result of the 4 January attacks and any
   subsequent fighting in the months ahead will diminish the already slim
   chances of repatriation getting underway. Security restrictions,
   particularly on access for UN agencies and NGOs, will alarm any
   Rohingya possibly considering returning under the repatriation scheme,
   and could result in further hardship for the estimated 200,000 who have
   stayed behind in northern Rakhine State. Regardless of the AA’s
   position, the ethno-nationalist sentiment whipped up among ethnic
   Rakhine will also create further caution among potential returnees,
   many of whom have already objected to coming back due to security
   concerns and lack of clarity over citizenship.^[fn]“Repatriation plan
   stalls as Rohingya refuse to return to Myanmar”, Catholic News Service,
   15 November 2018.Hide Footnote

V. Conclusion

   The AA attacks on 4 January were a provocative step that asserted the
   group’s growing military capabilities and popular support among Rakhine
   people. There is a serious risk that an escalatory dynamic takes hold,
   which could plunge the state deeper into armed conflict. Preventing
   escalation will require the AA to refrain from further attacks, and the
   government and military to resist the urge to retaliate politically and
   militarily. Escalation would fuel support for the AA and reinforce
   ethnic divisions between the Rakhine and the Burman majority. The
   military should exercise restraint in its “clearance operations”,
   avoiding the harm to civilians that regularly mars its
   counter-insurgency activity, and expand the unilateral ceasefire to
   encompass Rakhine State. The government should make overtures to the AA
   through informal channels and encourage other peace stakeholders with
   leverage over the AA to bring the ethnic Rakhine insurgents to the
   negotiating table. Further, all sides should avoid rhetoric that could
   further inflame ethnic tensions.
   " The government needs to begin a genuine and inclusive dialogue with
   the Rakhine people. "

   China has an important role to play. Its growing influence within the
   peace process became increasingly clear through 2018, and in December
   it helped convene a meeting of the AA, Ta’ang National Liberation Army
   and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army at which they expressed
   support for dialogue with the government. Its ability to pressure the
   AA may be limited because of the lack of cultural ties between the
   Rakhine and Chinese, and Rakhine State’s distance from China’s border,
   but it can still exercise influence by proxy through the AA’s key
   allies, including the Kachin and Wa armed groups.

   Most importantly, the government needs to begin a genuine and inclusive
   dialogue with the Rakhine people, including the state’s political
   actors, regarding the state’s future political, economic and social
   trajectory. In particular, this dialogue should cover the repatriation
   process, rebuilding Rohingya communities, economic development and
   power sharing between the central and state governments.^[fn]The
   importance of including the Rakhine community in state-level
   decision-making was emphasised in the final report of the Advisory
   Commission on Rakhine State chaired by the late Dr Kofi Annan.Hide
   Footnote As a gesture of good-will, and to kick-start this dialogue,
   the government should consider releasing Aye Maung and other ethnic
   Rakhine political prisoners. It is only through political inclusion
   that Myanmar can avert a further strengthening of the ethnic Rakhine
   insurgency.

Myanmar: A Violent Push to Shake Up Ceasefire Negotiations

   A trio of ethnic armed groups have escalated their fight with the
   military in Myanmar’s Shan State. This alliance has long been outside
   the country’s peace process. With China’s help, the government should
   pursue bilateral ceasefires – and longer-term rapprochement – with the
   three organisations.

After a Summer of Protests, Can Georgia’s Government Regain Its Lost Trust?

   This summer’s protests in Georgia led to changes to the country’s

   Gakharia, is a man protesters wanted ousted from the last government,
   in which he led the Interior Ministry. In this interview with World
   Politics Review, Europe & Central Asia Program Director Olga Oliker and
   Analyst for EU Eastern Neighbourhood Olesya Vartanyan consider what
   Gakharia’s tenure will bring, and how the parliamentary elections next
   year might play out in this atmosphere.

The Middle East: Should We Give Up?

   Middle Eastern states are undergoing a profound social and political
   transformation in the aftermath of the Arab uprisings and the civil
   wars these sprouted. Crisis Group's Joost Hiltermann, Program Director
   for the Middle East and North Africa, discusses whether there is a role
   for external actors in halting and even reversing the downward slide,
   given the enormity of the challenge and a history of destructive
   external intervention.

   This seminar will take start at 17:00 GMT on 25 January 2019 and is
   open to the public.
   Investcorp Auditorium, Middle East Centre, St Antony's College, Oxford
