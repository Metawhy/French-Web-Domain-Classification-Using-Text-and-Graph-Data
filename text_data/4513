Einstein's Relativity and Everyday Life

By Clifford M. Will



   Earth viewed from space

   What good is fundamental physics to the person on the street?

   This is the perennial question posed to physicists by their non-science
   friends, by students in the humanities and social sciences, and by
   politicians looking to justify spending tax dollars on basic science.
   One of the problems is that it is hard to predict definitely what the
   payback of basic physics will be, though few dispute that physics is
   somehow "good."

   Physicists have become adept at finding good examples of the long-term
   benefit of basic physics: the quantum theory of solids leading to
   semiconductors and computer chips, nuclear magnetic resonance leading
   to MRI imaging, particle accelerators leading to beams for cancer
   treatment. But what about Einstein's theories of special and general
   relativity? One could hardly imagine a branch of fundamental physics
   less likely to have practical consequences. But strangely enough,
   relativity plays a key role in a multi-billion dollar growth industry
   centered around the Global Positioning System (GPS).

   When Einstein finalized his theory of gravity and curved spacetime in
   November 1915, ending a quest which he began with his 1905 special
   relativity, he had little concern for practical or observable
   consequences. He was unimpressed when measurements of the bending of
   starlight in 1919 confirmed his theory. Even today, general relativity
   plays its main role in the astronomical domain, with its black holes,
   gravity waves and cosmic big bangs, or in the domain of the
   ultra-small, where theorists look to unify general relativity with the
   other interactions, using exotic concepts such as strings and branes.

   But GPS is an exception. Built at a cost of over $10 billion mainly for
   military navigation, GPS has rapidly transformed itself into a thriving
   commercial industry. The system is based on an array of 24 satellites
   orbiting the earth, each carrying a precise atomic clock. Using a
   hand-held GPS receiver which detects radio emissions from any of the
   satellites which happen to be overhead, users of even moderately priced
   devices can determine latitude, longitude and altitude to an accuracy
   which can currently reach 15 meters, and local time to 50 billionths of
   a second. Apart from the obvious military uses, GPS is finding
   applications in airplane navigation, oil exploration, wilderness
   recreation, bridge construction, sailing, and interstate trucking, to
   name just a few. Even Hollywood has met GPS, recently pitting James
   Bond in "Tomorrow Never Dies" against an evil genius who was inserting
   deliberate errors into the GPS system and sending British ships into
   harm's way.

   But in a relativistic world, things are not simple. The satellite
   clocks are moving at 14,000 km/hr in orbits that circle the Earth twice
   per day, much faster than clocks on the surface of the Earth, and
   Einstein's theory of special relativity says that rapidly moving clocks
   tick more slowly, by about seven microseconds (millionths of a second)
   per day.

   Also, the orbiting clocks are 20,000 km above the Earth, and experience
   gravity that is four times weaker than that on the ground. Einstein's
   general relativity theory says that gravity curves space and time,
   resulting in a tendency for the orbiting clocks to tick slightly
   faster, by about 45 microseconds per day. The net result is that time
   on a GPS satellite clock advances faster than a clock on the ground by
   about 38 microseconds per day.

   To determine its location, the GPS receiver uses the time at which each
   signal from a satellite was emitted, as determined by the on-board
   atomic clock and encoded into the signal, together the with speed of
   light, to calculate the distance between itself and the satellites it
   communicated with. The orbit of each satellite is known accurately.
   Given enough satellites, it is a simple problem in Euclidean geometry
   to compute the receiver's precise location, both in space and time. To
   achieve a navigation accuracy of 15 meters, time throughout the GPS
   system must be known to an accuracy of 50 nanoseconds, which simply
   corresponds to the time required for light to travel 15 meters.

   But at 38 microseconds per day, the relativistic offset in the rates of
   the satellite clocks is so large that, if left uncompensated, it would
   cause navigational errors that accumulate faster than 10 km per day!
   GPS accounts for relativity by electronically adjusting the rates of
   the satellite clocks, and by building mathematical corrections into the
   computer chips which solve for the user's location. Without the proper
   application of relativity, GPS would fail in its navigational functions
   within about 2 minutes.

   So the next time your plane approaches an airport in bad weather, and
   you just happen to be wondering "what good is basic physics?", think
   about Einstein and the GPS tracker in the cockpit, helping the pilots
   guide you to a safe landing.

PhysicsQuest: Spectra's Energetic Escape

   Out Now: Spectra's Energetic Escape!

   PhysicsQuest: "Spectra's Energetic Escape!" has shipped!

   Did you miss your chance to get the free kit, but still want to follow
   Spectra's adventures—and explore all the fun experiments that go along
   with Spectra's Energetic Escape? You can find the comic, along with the
   teacher's manual edition, on the PhysicsQuest page!

   The students at Tesla Junior High are thrilled to hear that their
   favorite magazine, Fetch, has selected their school to be profiled in
   their upcoming issue. There's just one twist—they aren't profiling the
   whole school, just a select 16 that will be competing in 24 hours of
   challenges to win tickets to see the latest, hottest boy band, the Free
   Radicals!

   As usual, however, things don't go as planned. Your students will learn
   about energy and motion while they help their favorite middle school
   students escape the accidental catastrophe caused by Nolan R. Gibbs
   (N.R.G.), the editor in chief of Fetch. Learn about energy transfer in
   pendulums, making a potential energy powered pinwheel, energy and
   friction, and bouncy ball rockets! See who makes it to the concert...or
   even makes it out alive!
   If you'd like to download past manuals or comics and create your own
   kits, that can be done through links on the About PhysicsQuest page.

   Read all of our physics comic books online, and follow the adventures
   of Spectra, the original laser superhero.
