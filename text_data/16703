   1. Introduction
   With the following information we would like to provide you, as the
   'data subject', with an overview of the processing of your personal
   data by us and your rights under the data protection laws. Basically,
   it is possible to use our web pages without entering any personal data.
   However, if you wish to avail yourself of particular services provided
   by our company via our website, it could become necessary to process
   personal data. If the processing of personal data is necessary and if
   there is no legal basis for such processing, we will as a general rule
   obtain your consent.
   Personal data, for example your name, address or e-mail address, are
   always processed in harmony with the General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) and in harmony with the country-specific data protection
   provisions that apply to eurodata AG. By issuing this data protection
   declaration, we would like to inform you about the scope and purpose of
   the personal data that we gather, use and process.
   As the controller, we have implemented numerous technical and
   organisational measures in order to ensure the most complete protection
   possible of the personal data processed via this website. Having said
   that, Internet-based data transmissions can as a matter of basic
   principle have security gaps, so that absolute protection cannot be
   guaranteed. For this reason you are at liberty to send us personal data
   by other means, for example by telephone or post.
   2. Controller

   Controller within the meaning of the GDPR is:
   eurodata SAS
   Z.I. Carrefour de I'Europe BP 30180
   Rue Victor Grignard
   F-57603 Forbach Cedex
   Phone: +33 387 852 534
   Fax: +33 387 850 013
   E-Mail: info@eurodata.fr
   Managing Director:
   Eric Zins
   Joop Hoestra

   3.  Data protection officer

   You can contact the data protection officer as follows:

   Robert BOUR, eurodata SAS, ZI Carrefour de l’Europe 57600 FORBACH

   Téléphone : +33 3 87 85 25 34

   E-mail : dpo@eurodata.fr

   You can consult our data protection officer directly at any time if you
   have any questions or ideas about data protection.
   4. Definitions

   The data protection declaration is based on the concepts used in the
   enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the
   European bodies that issue directives and regulations. Our data
   protection declaration should be easy to read and easy to understand,
   both for the general public and for our customers and business
   partners. To ensure that, we would first like to explain the terms we
   use.
   The terms we use in this data protection declaration include the
   following:
    a. Personal data
       Personal data are all information which relates to an identified or
       identifiable natural person. A natural person is considered
       identifiable if he or she can be directly or indirectly identified,
       in particular by means of allocation to some means of
       identification such as a name, an identification number, location
       data, an on-line ID or one or more special features which are an
       expression of the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
       economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
    b. Data subject
       A data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person
       whose personal data are processed by the controller (our company).
    c. Processing
       Processing is any procedure carried out with or without the aid of
       automated methods or any such series of procedures in connection
       with personal data, such as gathering, recording, organisation,
       putting in order, storage, adaptation or alteration, readout,
       search, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or other
       form of provision, comparison or combination, restriction, deletion
       or destruction.
    d. Restriction of processing
       Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data
       with the aim of restricting their future processing.
    e. Profiling
       Profiling is any kind of automated processing of personal data
       which consists in using those personal data to assess certain
       personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to
       analyse or forecast aspects relating to the work performance,
       economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests,
       reliability, behaviour, whereabouts or relocation of that natural
       person.
    f. Pseudonymisation
       Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a way
       that the personal data can no longer be allocated to a specific
       data subject without adding further information, provided that that
       further information is kept separately and is subject to technical
       and organisational measures which ensure that the personal data are
       not allocated to an identified or identifiable natural person.
    g. Processor
       Processor is any natural person or legal entity, authority,
       institution or other body which processes personal data on behalf
       of the controller.
    h. Recipient
       Recipient is any natural person or legal entity, authority,
       institution or other body to whom or which personal data are
       disclosed, regardless of whether that person, entity, authority,
       institution or body is a third party or not. However, authorities
       which may receive personal data in the context of a particular
       inquiry under EU law or the law of the Member States are not
       regarded as recipients.
    i. Third party
       A third party is any natural person or legal entity, authority,
       institution or other body who or which is not the data subject, the
       controller, the processor or the persons authorised to process the
       personal data under the direct responsibility of the controller or
       processor.
    j. Consent
       Consent is any informed statement of intent made voluntarily and
       unambiguously by the data subject for the particular case and in
       the form of a statement or other clear affirmative action by which
       the data subject indicates that he or she is in agreement with the
       processing of the personal data that relate to him or her.

   5. Legal basis of processing
   Art. 6 1. a) of the GDPR serves our company as a legal basis for
   processing in respect of which we obtain consent for a specific
   processing purpose.
   If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of
   a contract to which you are a party, as is for example the case with
   processing which is necessary for the delivery of goods or the
   rendering of some other service or consideration, the processing is
   based on Art. 6 1. b) of the GDPR. The same applies to processing which
   is required for carrying out measures preceding the conclusion of a
   contract, for example in cases where enquiries are made about our
   products or services.
   If our company is subject to a legal obligation which renders the
   processing of personal data necessary, for example the fulfilment of
   fiscal obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 1. c) of the
   GDPR.
   In rare cases it may be necessary to process personal data in order to
   protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural
   person. This would for example be the case if a visitor were to be
   injured on our company premises, following which his or her name, age
   and health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed
   on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing
   would be based on Art. 6 1. d) of the GDPR.
   Finally, processing could be based on Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR. This is
   the legal basis for processing which is not covered by any of the
   above-mentioned legal bases, if the processing is necessary for
   safeguarding a legitimate interest of our company or a third party,
   provided that that interest is not outweighed by the interests and / or
   fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. We are in
   particular permitted to carry out processing of this kind because
   special mention of it has been made by the European legislators. They,
   for example, took the view that a legitimate interest could be presumed
   to exist if you were a customer of our company (Recital 47 Sentence 2
   of the GDPR).
   6 Technology
   6.1 SSL / TLS encryption
   This site makes use of SSL or TLS encryption to ensure security in data
   processing and to protect the transmission of confidential content such
   as orders, log-in data or contact enquiries that you send to us as the
   provider. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that
   there is an "https://" instead of an "http://" in the address bar of
   the browser and a padlock symbol in your browser bar.
   If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us
   cannot be read by third parties.
   6.2 Data gathered when you visit the website
   When you use our website for information purposes only, i.e. if you do
   not register or send information to us in any other way, we only gather
   the data that your browser transmits to our server (in so-called
   'server logfiles'). Each time a page is accessed by you or by an
   automated system, our website gathers a set of general data and
   information. These general data and information are stored in the
   logfiles of the server and may include
    1. the browser types and versions used
    2. the operating system used by the accessing system
    3. the web page from which an accessing system is referred to our
       website (so-called referrer)
    4. the sub-sites targeted on our website by an accessing system
    5. the date and time of access to the website
    6. a truncated Internet Protocol address (anonymised IP address)
    7. the Internet service provider of the accessing system
    8. the quantity of data sent in bytes.

   When utilising these general data and information we do not draw any
   conclusions as regards your person. On the contrary, the information is
   required for
    1. the correct delivery of the content of our website
    2. the optimisation of the content of our website and the advertising
       thereof
    3. ensuring the continuing functionality of our IT systems and the
       technology of our website and
    4. providing the authorities with the information they require for
       prosecution in the case of a cyber attack.

   These data and information, having been gathered, are thus analysed by
   us, on the one hand statistically, and also with the aim of improving
   data protection and data security in our company, so that we can
   ultimately ensure an optimum level of protection for the personal data
   we process. The anonymous data from the server logfiles are stored
   separately from all the personal data made available by a data subject.
   The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR.
   Our legitimate interest follows from the purposes of data gathering
   listed above.
   7 Cookies
   7.1 General information on cookies
   We deploy cookies on our website. Cookies are small files which are
   generated by your browser automatically and stored in your IT system
   (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar) when you visit our site.
   Cookies do not cause any damage on your device, and they do not contain
   any viruses, Trojans or other malware.
   Information that arises in connection with the device specifically
   deployed is stored in the cookie. However, this does not mean that we
   directly gain knowledge of your identity as a result.
   On the one hand, the deployment of cookies serves the purpose of making
   it more agreeable for you to use our amenities. For example, we deploy
   so-called session cookies which enable us to recognise that you have
   already visited individual pages on our website. These are deleted
   automatically when you leave the site.
   We also deploy temporary cookies to optimise user-friendliness. These
   are saved on your device for a certain fixed period. If you revisit our
   site to take advantage of the services we offer, the cookie
   automatically recognises both the fact that you have been there before
   and the entries you made and the settings you had, so that you do not
   need to enter them again.
   Furthermore, we deploy cookies so as to be able to record the use of
   our website statistically and analyse it for the purpose of optimising
   our amenities. These cookies enable us to recognise automatically that
   you have been there before when you revisit our site, and are deleted
   automatically after a defined period of time.
   The data processed by the cookies are necessary for the above-mentioned
   purposes of safeguarding our legitimate interests and those of third
   parties in accordance with Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR.
   Most browsers accept cookies automatically. Having said that, you can
   configure your browser in such a way that no cookies are saved on your
   computer, or in such a way that a notice always appears before a new
   cookie is generated. Complete deactivation of cookies, however, can
   lead to a status in which you cannot take advantage of all the
   functions of our website.
   8 Content of our website
   8.1 Contact / contact form
   Personal data are gathered when you make contact with us (e.g. by
   contact form or e-mail). Which data are actually gathered when a
   contact form is used can be seen in the contact form itself. These data
   are stored and used exclusively for the purpose of replying to your
   enquiry and / or making contact and the technical administration
   associated with it. The legal basis for the processing of the data is
   our legitimate interest in replying to your enquiry in accordance with
   Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR. If you make contact with us aiming to
   conclude a contract, a further legal basis for the processing is Art. 6
   1. b) of the GDPR. Your data will be deleted when your enquiry has
   finally been dealt with. This is the case when the circumstances
   indicate that the matter concerned has been finally resolved and there
   are no statutory obligations to preserve business records such as would
   contradict the deletion.

   9 Distribution of newsletter
   9.1 Distribution of the newsletter to existing customers
   If you have provided us with your e-mail address when purchasing goods
   or services, we reserve the right to send you regular offers regarding
   goods and / or services similar to the ones you have already purchased
   from our product range by e-mail. For this, in accordance with Section
   7 (3) of the German Unfair Competition Act (UWG), we are not under any
   obligation to obtain separate consent from you. To that extent, the
   data are processed solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in
   personalised direct advertising as in Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR. If you
   objected to the use of your e-mail address for this purpose at the
   outset, no mails will be sent by us. You have the right to object to
   the use of your e-mail address for the above-mentioned advertising
   purposes at any time with future effect by notifying the controller
   named at the beginning. If you do so, you only incur transmission costs
   at the basic rates. When your objection has been received, the use of
   your e-mail address for advertising purposes will be discontinued
   immediately.
   9.2 Promotional newsletter
   On our website you have the option of subscribing to our company
   newsletter. The personal data that are transmitted to us when you order
   the newsletter can be seen in the template you use for that purpose.
   We inform our customers and business partners at regular intervals via
   a newsletter about our product range. As a matter of basic principle,
   you can only receive the newsletter of our company if
    1. you have a valid e-mail address and
    2. you have registered for the newsletter.

   For legal reasons, a confirmation mail in the double opt-in procedure
   will be sent to the e-mail address you entered when you first signed up
   for the newsletter. This confirmation mail serves the purpose of
   enabling us to verify that you, as the holder of the e-mail address,
   have actually authorised us to send you the newsletter.
   When you register for the newsletter we also save the IP address of the
   IT system you were using at the time when you registered, allocated by
   your Internet service provider (ISP), and the date and time of
   registration. The gathering of these data is necessary in order to be
   able to trace the (possible) abuse of your e-mail address at a later
   point in time and thus serves to protect us from a legal point of view.
   The personal data gathered in the context of registration for the
   newsletter are used exclusively for its distribution. Moreover,
   subscribers to the newsletter can be informed by e-mail if this is
   necessary to the running of the newsletter service or registration in
   respect of it, such as could be the case if changes were made to the
   newsletter service or modifications to the technical facilities.
   Personal data gathered in the context of the newsletter service will
   not be passed on or otherwise disclosed to third parties. You can give
   notice to terminate your subscription to our newsletter at any time.
   The consent to the storage of personal data that you have given us for
   distribution of the newsletter can be revoked at any time. For the
   purpose of revoking that consent, there is an appropriate link in each
   newsletter. Furthermore, you have the possibility to deregister from
   the newsletter at any time by sending an appropriate message to the
   controller referred to at the beginning.
   The legal basis for data processing for the purpose of newsletter
   distribution is Art. 6 1. a) of the GDPR.
   9.3 Newsletter tracking
   Our newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is
   a miniature graphic which is embedded in e-mails sent in HTML format so
   as to enable logfile recording and logfile analysis. This makes it
   possible to carry out a statistical analysis of the success or failure
   of on-line marketing campaigns. With the aid of the embedded tracking
   pixel, the company can recognise whether an e-mail has been opened by
   you, if so when, and which of the links in the e-mail you accessed.
   Personal data gathered via the tracking pixels contained in the
   newsletters are stored and analysed by us in order to optimise
   distribution of the newsletter and adapt the content of future
   newsletters to suit your interests even better. These personal data are
   not passed on to third parties. Data subjects have the right to revoke
   the separate declaration of consent made via the double opt-in
   procedure at any time. After revocation these personal data will be
   deleted by us. We interpret deregistration from receipt of the
   newsletter automatically as revocation.
   In particular, an analysis of this kind is carried out in accordance
   with Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interests
   in personalised advertising, market research and / or the design of our
   website as required.
   10 Plugins and other services

   10.1 Google Analytics

   This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by
   Google Inc. ('Google'). Google Analytics employs so-called 'cookies',
   text files that are saved on your computer and enable an analysis to be
   made of your use of the website. The information generated by the
   cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a
   server of Google in the USA and stored there. On activation of the IP
   anonymisation facility on this website, however, your IP address will,
   within the member states of the European Union or other states which
   are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, first be
   truncated. Only in exceptional cases will the whole IP address be
   transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and truncated there. On
   behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this
   information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on
   site activity for the operator and provide the operator with other
   services relating to website activity and Internet usage. The IP
   address that your browser conveys within the scope of Google Analytics
   will not be combined with any other data stored by Google. The personal
   data is transferred under the EU-US Privacy Shield on the basis of the
   adequacy decision of the European Commission to the United States. You
   can retrieve the certificate at
   https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI. You

   draw your attention to the fact that on this website Google Analytics
   has been extended to include the code "gat._anonymizeIp();" to ensure
   that IP addresses can only be recorded in anonymised form (so-called IP
   masking). Source: www.datenschutzbeauftragter-info.de
   10.2 Google Maps
   On our website we use Google Maps (API) from Google LLC., 1600
   Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Maps is a
   web service for the depiction of interactive maps with the purpose of
   providing a visual display of geographical information. Via the use of
   this service, for example, the location of our premises can be
   displayed to you, which will make it easier for you to find your way
   here if you wish to.
   As soon as you access the sub-pages in which the map from Google Maps
   is integrated, information about your use of our website (such as your
   IP address) is transmitted to Google servers in the USA and stored
   there. This happens regardless of whether Google provides a user
   account to which you have logged in or not. If you are logged in to
   Google, your data are allocated to your account directly. If you do not
   wish the data to be allocated to your profile at Google, you have to
   log out of your Google user account. Google stores your data (even for
   users who have not logged in) as a usage profile, and analyses them. In
   particular, this analysis is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 1.
   f) of the GDPR on the basis of the legitimate interests of Google in
   personalised advertising, market research and / or the design of its
   website as required. You have the right to object to the creation of
   these usage profiles, but you have to apply to Google itself in order
   to exercise that right.
   Google LLC with its registered office in the USA is certified for the
   US-European data protection convention 'Privacy Shield', which ensures
   compliance with the level of data protection currently applicable in
   the EU.
   If you are not in agreement with the future transmission of your data
   to Google in the context of using Google Maps, you also have the
   possibility of disabling the web service of Google Maps completely by
   deactivating the JavaScript application in your browser. If you do
   that, however, it will not be possible to use Google Maps or the map
   display on this website.
   We use Google Maps in the interests of making an appealing display of
   our on-line amenities and making it easy for you to find the locations
   we refer to on the website. This constitutes a legitimate interest
   within the meaning of Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR.
   You can view Google's terms of use at
   https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html
   For the additional terms of use applying to Google Maps go to
   https://www.google.com/intl/de_US/help/terms_maps.html
   For comprehensive information on data protection in connection with the
   use of Google Maps go to the Google website ('Google Privacy Policy'):
   https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/
   10.3 Google Web Fonts
   Our website uses so-called web fonts for the uniform depiction of fonts
   provided by Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA
   94043, USA. When you access a page, your browser loads the required web
   fonts into your browser cache to enable texts and fonts to be displayed
   correctly.
   To this end, the browser you use must make connection with the servers
   at Google. In this way, Google gains knowledge of the fact that our
   website has been accessed via your IP address. Google web fonts are
   used in the interests of uniform and appealing depiction on our
   website.
   This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 1.
   f) of the GDPR.
   Google LLC with its registered office in the USA is certified for the
   US-European data protection convention 'Privacy Shield', which ensures
   compliance with the level of data protection currently applicable in
   the EU.
   For more information on Google web fonts go to
   https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and
   the Google data protection declaration at:
   https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
   10.4 YouTube (Videos)
   This website uses the YouTube embedding function for the depiction and
   playback of videos by the provider 'YouTube', which is part of Google
   LLC., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
   ('Google').
   The extended data protection mode is used here. According to
   information from the provider, user information does not begin to be
   saved until the video(s) is / are replayed. When the replay of embedded
   YouTube videos begins, the provider 'YouTube' deploys cookies in order
   to gather information about the behaviour of the user. According to
   information furnished by 'YouTube', the purposes this serves include
   the compilation of video statistics, the improvement of
   user-friendliness and the prevention of abuse. If you are logged in to
   Google, your data are allocated directly to your account when you click
   on a video. If you do not wish the data to be allocated to your profile
   at YouTube, you need to log out prior to activating the button. Google
   stores your data (even for users who have not logged in) as usage
   profiles and analyses them. Analysis of this kind is carried out in
   particular in accordance with Art. 6 1. f) of the GDPR on the basis of
   the legitimate interests of Google in personalised advertising, market
   research and / or the design of its website as required. You have the
   right to object to the creation of these user profiles, but you have to
   apply to YouTube itself in order to exercise that right.
   Regardless of any replay of embedded videos, each access of this
   website causes a connection to be made to the Google network
   'DoubleClick' , and this in turn may trigger off further data
   processing sequences which are beyond our influence.
   Google LLC with its registered office in the USA is certified for the
   US-European data protection convention 'Privacy Shield', which ensures
   compliance with the level of data protection currently applicable in
   the EU.
   You can obtain more information on data protection at 'YouTube' in the
   provider's data protection declaration at:
   https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy
   11 Your rights as the data subject
   11.1 Right to confirmation
   You have the right to request confirmation from us as to whether or not
   personal data that relate to you are being processed.
   11.2 Right of access as in Art. 15 of the GDPR
   You have the right to receive free information at any time from us
   about the personal data stored relating to your person, and a copy of
   those data.
   11.3 Right to rectification as in Art. 16 of the GDPR
   You have the right to request the rectification of incorrect personal
   data that relate to you. Furthermore, the data subject has the right to
   request that incomplete personal data be completed, taking into account
   the purposes of the processing.
   11.4 Erasure as in Art. 17 of the GDPR
   You have the right to request us to delete personal data that relate to
   you without delay if any of the reasons provided for by law apply and
   the processing is not necessary.
   11.5 Restriction of processing as in Art. 18 of the GDPR
   You have the right to request us to restrict processing if any of the
   statutory prerequisites exist.
   11.6 Data portability as in Art. 20 of the GDPR
   You have the right to receive the personal data which relate to you and
   which you made available to us in a structured, commonly used,
   machine-readable format. Without any hindrance on our part, you also
   have the right to transmit those data to another controller to whom the
   personal data have been provided, if the processing is done on the
   basis of consent as in Art. 6 1. a) of the GDPR or Art. 9 2. a) of the
   GDPR or a contract as in Art. 6 1. b) of the GDPR and carried out by
   automated means, provided that the processing is not necessary for the
   performance of a task or duty which is in the public interest or in the
   exercising of official authority which has been vested in us.
   Apart from that, when exercising your right to data portability in
   accordance with Art. 20 1. of the GDPR, you have the right to have the
   personal data transferred directly from one controller to another if
   this is technically feasible and does not impair the rights and
   freedoms of others.
   11.7 Objection as in Art. 21 of the GDPR
   You have the right to lodge an objection to the processing of personal
   data that relate to you at any time for reasons arising from your
   particular situation, if said processing is done on the basis of Art. 6
   1. e) (data processing in the public interest) or f) (data processing
   on the basis of a balancing of interests) of the GDPR.
   This also applies to profiling based on these provisions as in Art. 4
   4. of the GDPR.
   If you do lodge an objection, we will not process your personal data
   any more unless we can produce evidence of compelling legitimate
   reasons for doing so such as outweigh your interests, rights and
   freedoms, or unless the processing serves the purpose of asserting,
   exercising or defending legal claims.
   In individual cases we process personal data in order to carry out
   direct advertising. You can object at any time to the processing of
   personal data for the purpose of such advertising. The same applies to
   profiling if it is done in connection with such direct advertising. If
   you lodge an objection with us to processing for the purposes of direct
   advertising, we will no longer process personal data for those
   purposes.
   You also have the right, for reasons arising from your particular
   situation, to lodge an objection to the processing of personal data
   that relate to you, if such processing is done for scientific or
   historical research purposes or statistical purposes as in Art. 89 1.
   of the GDPR, unless such processing is necessary to the performance of
   a task in the public interest.
   In connection with the use of services of the information society,
   notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you are free to exercise your
   right to object by means of automated procedures in which technical
   specifications are applied.
   11.8 Revocation of consent under data protection law
   You have the right to revoke your consent to the processing of personal
   data at any time with future effect.
   11.9 Complaining to a supervisory authority
   You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority which is
   competent for data protection about our processing of personal data.
   12 Routine storage, deletion and disabling of personal data
   We only process and store your personal data for the period which is
   necessary to the achievement of the purpose of that storage, or if such
   processing and storage have been provided for in the legal provisions
   to which our company is subject.
   If the purpose of storage ceases to apply or if a prescribed storage
   deadline expires, the personal data will be disabled or deleted as a
   matter of routine and in accordance with the statutory regulations.
   13 Duration of the storage of personal data
   The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the
   respective statutory retention period for documents and records. After
   expiry of that period the data concerned will be deleted as a matter of
   routine provided that they are no longer required for the performance
   or negotiation of a contract.
   14 Current applicability and amendment of the data protection
   declaration
   This data protection declaration is currently applicable and was issued
   in May 2018.
   It may become necessary to modify this data protection declaration on
   account of the further development of our web pages and amenities or
