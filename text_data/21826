     * French artist @JR gave WWD an inside look at his work – including
       the project that some said would get him killed.⁣ ⁣ JR is at the
       Brooklyn Museum in the days ahead of a major show, “Chronicles,”
       which surveys his complete body of work for the first time in North
       America. ⁣ JR challenged stereotypes by highlighting humanity
       through specificity.⁣ ⁣ For “Face to Face” he and artist friend
       Marco photographed Israelis and Palestinians who worked in the same
       professions — two actors, two sculptors, two security guards, two
       teachers — again with each posing how they imagined the other would
       see them. The artists pasted the dual images on the wall. JR struck
       up conversations with people passing by as a cameraman documented;
       the viewers had trouble figuring out who was from where.⁣ ⁣ “Only
       art can bring you to that complexity and paradox of things,” he
       says. “That made me realize that the people become the best
       spokesperson about the work because they’re from there. It really
       made me realize the power of the community and how they take the
       project forward,” he adds.⁣ ⁣ Tap the link in bio for more. ⁣ ⁣

The Four Personas of a Serial Returner

   Retailers are starting to push back against "serial returners."

   What goes through your mind as you return a purchase? A quick search on
   Reddit will reveal hundreds of consumer discussions ranging from their
   anxieties of being prevented from purchasing from their favorite
   retailers to their lack of guilt over taking full advantage of the
   liberal return policies most retailers have adopted in recent years.

   Most recently, there’s been a conversational spike around: “How many
   returns is too many?” Or, “Am I going to be banned for ‘abusing the
   return policy’?”

   The rising fear among customers over being banned is to be expected.
   Retailers have begun to recognize that free and easy returns are
   causing significant damage to their bottom line. For example, Asos
   famously changed their return policy this year with a special caveat:
   “If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn’t sit
   right…then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated
   accounts.”

   And Asos is not alone. Amazon, Best Buy and Net-a-porter have all
   instituted similar policies. There are many significant costs that rise
   with product returns. For example, Statista estimates that return
   deliveries alone will cost $550 billion by 2020, and that doesn’t
   include the labor and disposition costs. It’s no surprise that
   retailers are starting to fight back against rising returns, with some
   retailers instituting an outright ban of customers who return what they
   deem to be excessive amounts.

   Those customers are known as the dreaded “Serial Returners.”

   Banning a serial returner impacts more than that individual customer.
   It diminishes the overall brand value and makes your customers angry —
   or worse, afraid to shop with you. The result is that customers become
   wary and unsure of how retailers define returns exploitative behavior.
   One typical comment on Yelp: “A consumer shouldn’t have to calculate
   their return behaviors in order to maintain their shopping freedom.”

   We agree and believe that there are better alternatives to address
   Serial Returners than instituting draconian return policies that cut
   off those who exploit lax return policies from future purchases. The
   ability to identify who they are and why they return is an opportunity
   to learn and grow as a business. Analyzing their behavior is the first
   step to discouraging exploitative behavior without sacrificing customer
   experience and is an important component of overall returns reduction.

   Remember the 80/20 Rule

   Before we discuss the classification of Serial Returners, let’s first
   address your best customers based on Customer Lifetime Value. These are
   your customers that buy frequently, return frequently, but come back to
   buy even more. If 80 percent of your sales are due to 20 percent of
   your shoppers, there’s a good chance they’re making some significant
   returns just due to the sheer volume at which they purchase. According
   to a former Zappos executive, “our best customers have the highest
   return rates, but they are also the ones that spend the most money with
   us and are our most profitable customers.” These customers are also
   more likely to be advocates for your brand, spreading word-of-mouth and
   e-WOM.

   The Four Serial Returner Personas

   While Serial Returners are an easy scapegoat for high return rates, not
   all Serial Returners are fraudulent or profligate. We have identified
   four major categories of “Serial Returner Personas.” When you identify
   which category your returner falls under, then you can take meaningful
   action to reduce the amount or frequency at which they return.

   Compulsive Shoppers

   Impulse purchases can be extremely lucrative for apparel retailers,
   particularly online. But when impulse turns into compulsion, things get
   risky. People with compulsive buying behavior often feel guilt and
   remorse after a shopping binge and return products to allay the guilt.
   These shoppers can be identified by their habit of frequently
   purchasing large quantities of items only to return one, if not all, of
   the products.

   Wardrobers

   You probably know someone who has purchased an outfit to wear for a
   night out only to return it the next day. This common practice is a
   form of return fraud that occurs frequently for luxury products. It’s
   also seen in consumer electronics, for example, where shoppers will buy
   products for the Big Game only to return the next day.

   Social Media Wardrobers

   Driven by influencer-culture and social media, some shoppers are buying
   and wearing outfits #fortheinsta. In a day and age where everyone is
   expected to cultivate a personal brand, up to 10 percent of shoppers
   surveyed admit to buying clothes they’re planning to snap and send
   back. While #OOTD (“outfit of the day”) posts can provide some
   marketing, the cost of customers leveraging your store as a “free
   rental service” can swiftly outweigh the benefit, as Asos recognized.

   Bracketers

   Bracketing entails purchasing multiple versions of a style/item
   (different sizes, different colors, etc.) with the intent to return
   most of them, essentially turning their bedroom into a dressing room.
   Because e-commerce has made it so easy for shoppers to be indecisive
   without shouldering the financial burden, 40 percent of customers
   engage in some form of bracketing.

   Product Returns Are an Opportunity to Create Positive Customer
   Experience

   Once you stop painting your Serial Returners with a broad brush, you
   can take meaningful actions to improve the customer experience for the
   returner as well as your broader customer base. Knowing where on the
   spectrum your returner falls will enable you to make decisions on how
   to personalize the customer shopping journey, such as adjusting
   offerings or removing features that drive impulse purchases. You may
   even decide to customize the return journey as well, by deciding to
   gently rescind free return shipping privileges to those who are
   returning excessively.

   For example, if you’ve identified a customer is a Compulsive
   Shopper/Returner, you may decide to remove them from marketing e-mails
   or remove “scarcity notifications” (“Only a couple left!”) from their
   online experience. If you realize that you’re a hot brand with Social
   Media Wardrobers, you could pilot a rental program and market it to
   this segment of customers. If you have high numbers of Bracketers, you
   may invest in fit analytics technology or use available customer buying
   and return data to guide size selection so that customers can feel more
   confident with their choices during the consideration phase. And for
   your model customers, reward and incentivize their good behavior.

   With All these Serial Returners, How Do You Reduce Returns?

   In order to reduce returns while dealing with a complex variety of
   consumer return behavior, it’s important to have a holistic approach to
   data mining and analytics. It’s rare that all returns relevant data is
   analyzed in a comprehensive fashion to identify the root cause of
   certain returns, but that is where you need to start. Once you can
   identify where your customers are on the spectrum of return behavior
   you can take action.

   For example, are they exploiting a generous return policy, or have they
   been making purchase decisions with incomplete or faulty information?
   Another important area to support analysis is “customer listening,”
   particularly in the form of online reviews. Once you know why someone
   is returning, only then can you personalize the returns experience.
   While returns don’t have any impact on credit scoring, there are
   mechanisms being tested in the industry to score individuals and
   products based on their return factor.

   Given how expensive returns have become for retailers, they are a
   critical missing piece of the Customer Lifetime Value equation.
   Ultimately, to mitigate the havoc that Serial Returners have wreaked on
   the industry, retailers will need to better understand who and why
   these customers are returning in such high quantity and frequency.
   Having data that provides a detailed and comprehensive view of a
   customer’s return behavior will reveal opportunities to alleviate the
   rising costs of sustaining them as customers.

   Retailers are swimming in this raw data. It’s time to put it to work,
   because if you’re going to start “firing” your customers, it should be
   selective and used as a last resort.

       the project that some said would get him killed.⁣ ⁣ JR is at the
       Brooklyn Museum in the days ahead of a major show, “Chronicles,”
       which surveys his complete body of work for the first time in North
       America. ⁣ JR challenged stereotypes by highlighting humanity
       through specificity.⁣ ⁣ For “Face to Face” he and artist friend
       Marco photographed Israelis and Palestinians who worked in the same
       professions — two actors, two sculptors, two security guards, two
       teachers — again with each posing how they imagined the other would
       see them. The artists pasted the dual images on the wall. JR struck
       up conversations with people passing by as a cameraman documented;
       the viewers had trouble figuring out who was from where.⁣ ⁣ “Only
       art can bring you to that complexity and paradox of things,” he
       says. “That made me realize that the people become the best
       spokesperson about the work because they’re from there. It really
       made me realize the power of the community and how they take the

       which surveys his complete body of work for the first time in North
       America. ⁣ JR challenged stereotypes by highlighting humanity
       through specificity.⁣ ⁣ For “Face to Face” he and artist friend
       Marco photographed Israelis and Palestinians who worked in the same
       professions — two actors, two sculptors, two security guards, two
       teachers — again with each posing how they imagined the other would
       see them. The artists pasted the dual images on the wall. JR struck
       up conversations with people passing by as a cameraman documented;
       the viewers had trouble figuring out who was from where.⁣ ⁣ “Only
       art can bring you to that complexity and paradox of things,” he
       says. “That made me realize that the people become the best
       spokesperson about the work because they’re from there. It really
       made me realize the power of the community and how they take the
       project forward,” he adds.⁣ ⁣ Tap the link in bio for more. ⁣ ⁣

     * French artist @JR gave WWD an inside look at his work – including
       the project that some said would get him killed.⁣ ⁣ JR is at the
       Brooklyn Museum in the days ahead of a major show, “Chronicles,”
       which surveys his complete body of work for the first time in North
       America. ⁣ JR challenged stereotypes by highlighting humanity
       through specificity.⁣ ⁣ For “Face to Face” he and artist friend
       Marco photographed Israelis and Palestinians who worked in the same
       professions — two actors, two sculptors, two security guards, two
       teachers — again with each posing how they imagined the other would
       see them. The artists pasted the dual images on the wall. JR struck
       up conversations with people passing by as a cameraman documented;
       the viewers had trouble figuring out who was from where.⁣ ⁣ “Only
       art can bring you to that complexity and paradox of things,” he
       says. “That made me realize that the people become the best
       spokesperson about the work because they’re from there. It really
       made me realize the power of the community and how they take the
       project forward,” he adds.⁣ ⁣ Tap the link in bio for more. ⁣ ⁣

       French artist @JR gave WWD an inside look at his work – including
       the project that some said would get him killed.⁣ ⁣ JR is at the
       Brooklyn Museum in the days ahead of a major show, “Chronicles,”
       which surveys his complete body of work for the first time in North
       America. ⁣ JR challenged stereotypes by highlighting humanity
       through specificity.⁣ ⁣ For “Face to Face” he and artist friend
       Marco photographed Israelis and Palestinians who worked in the same
       professions — two actors, two sculptors, two security guards, two
       teachers — again with each posing how they imagined the other would
       see them. The artists pasted the dual images on the wall. JR struck
       up conversations with people passing by as a cameraman documented;
       the viewers had trouble figuring out who was from where.⁣ ⁣ “Only
       art can bring you to that complexity and paradox of things,” he
       says. “That made me realize that the people become the best
       spokesperson about the work because they’re from there. It really
       made me realize the power of the community and how they take the
       project forward,” he adds.⁣ ⁣ Tap the link in bio for more. ⁣ ⁣

   Retailers are starting to push back against "serial returners."

   What goes through your mind as you return a purchase? A quick search on
   Reddit will reveal hundreds of consumer discussions ranging from their
   anxieties of being prevented from purchasing from their favorite
   retailers to their lack of guilt over taking full advantage of the
   liberal return policies most retailers have adopted in recent years.

   Most recently, there’s been a conversational spike around: “How many
   returns is too many?” Or, “Am I going to be banned for ‘abusing the
   return policy’?”

   The rising fear among customers over being banned is to be expected.
   Retailers have begun to recognize that free and easy returns are
   causing significant damage to their bottom line. For example, Asos
   famously changed their return policy this year with a special caveat:
   “If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn’t sit
   right…then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated
   accounts.”

   And Asos is not alone. Amazon, Best Buy and Net-a-porter have all
   instituted similar policies. There are many significant costs that rise
   with product returns. For example, Statista estimates that return
   deliveries alone will cost $550 billion by 2020, and that doesn’t
   include the labor and disposition costs. It’s no surprise that
   retailers are starting to fight back against rising returns, with some
   retailers instituting an outright ban of customers who return what they
   deem to be excessive amounts.

   Those customers are known as the dreaded “Serial Returners.”

   Banning a serial returner impacts more than that individual customer.
   It diminishes the overall brand value and makes your customers angry —
   or worse, afraid to shop with you. The result is that customers become
   wary and unsure of how retailers define returns exploitative behavior.
   One typical comment on Yelp: “A consumer shouldn’t have to calculate
   their return behaviors in order to maintain their shopping freedom.”

   We agree and believe that there are better alternatives to address
   Serial Returners than instituting draconian return policies that cut
   off those who exploit lax return policies from future purchases. The
   ability to identify who they are and why they return is an opportunity
   to learn and grow as a business. Analyzing their behavior is the first
   step to discouraging exploitative behavior without sacrificing customer
   experience and is an important component of overall returns reduction.

   Remember the 80/20 Rule

   Before we discuss the classification of Serial Returners, let’s first
   address your best customers based on Customer Lifetime Value. These are
   your customers that buy frequently, return frequently, but come back to
   buy even more. If 80 percent of your sales are due to 20 percent of
   your shoppers, there’s a good chance they’re making some significant
   returns just due to the sheer volume at which they purchase. According
   to a former Zappos executive, “our best customers have the highest
   return rates, but they are also the ones that spend the most money with
   us and are our most profitable customers.” These customers are also
   more likely to be advocates for your brand, spreading word-of-mouth and
   e-WOM.

   The Four Serial Returner Personas

   While Serial Returners are an easy scapegoat for high return rates, not
   all Serial Returners are fraudulent or profligate. We have identified
   four major categories of “Serial Returner Personas.” When you identify
   which category your returner falls under, then you can take meaningful
   action to reduce the amount or frequency at which they return.

   Compulsive Shoppers

   Impulse purchases can be extremely lucrative for apparel retailers,
   particularly online. But when impulse turns into compulsion, things get
   risky. People with compulsive buying behavior often feel guilt and
   remorse after a shopping binge and return products to allay the guilt.
   These shoppers can be identified by their habit of frequently
   purchasing large quantities of items only to return one, if not all, of
   the products.

   Wardrobers

   You probably know someone who has purchased an outfit to wear for a
   night out only to return it the next day. This common practice is a
   form of return fraud that occurs frequently for luxury products. It’s
   also seen in consumer electronics, for example, where shoppers will buy
   products for the Big Game only to return the next day.

   Social Media Wardrobers

   Driven by influencer-culture and social media, some shoppers are buying
   and wearing outfits #fortheinsta. In a day and age where everyone is
   expected to cultivate a personal brand, up to 10 percent of shoppers
   surveyed admit to buying clothes they’re planning to snap and send
   back. While #OOTD (“outfit of the day”) posts can provide some
   marketing, the cost of customers leveraging your store as a “free
   rental service” can swiftly outweigh the benefit, as Asos recognized.

   Bracketers

   Bracketing entails purchasing multiple versions of a style/item
   (different sizes, different colors, etc.) with the intent to return
   most of them, essentially turning their bedroom into a dressing room.
   Because e-commerce has made it so easy for shoppers to be indecisive
   without shouldering the financial burden, 40 percent of customers
   engage in some form of bracketing.

   Product Returns Are an Opportunity to Create Positive Customer
   Experience

   Once you stop painting your Serial Returners with a broad brush, you
   can take meaningful actions to improve the customer experience for the
   returner as well as your broader customer base. Knowing where on the
   spectrum your returner falls will enable you to make decisions on how
   to personalize the customer shopping journey, such as adjusting
   offerings or removing features that drive impulse purchases. You may
   even decide to customize the return journey as well, by deciding to
   gently rescind free return shipping privileges to those who are
   returning excessively.

   For example, if you’ve identified a customer is a Compulsive
   Shopper/Returner, you may decide to remove them from marketing e-mails
   or remove “scarcity notifications” (“Only a couple left!”) from their
   online experience. If you realize that you’re a hot brand with Social
   Media Wardrobers, you could pilot a rental program and market it to
   this segment of customers. If you have high numbers of Bracketers, you
   may invest in fit analytics technology or use available customer buying
   and return data to guide size selection so that customers can feel more
   confident with their choices during the consideration phase. And for
   your model customers, reward and incentivize their good behavior.

   With All these Serial Returners, How Do You Reduce Returns?

   In order to reduce returns while dealing with a complex variety of
   consumer return behavior, it’s important to have a holistic approach to
   data mining and analytics. It’s rare that all returns relevant data is
   analyzed in a comprehensive fashion to identify the root cause of
   certain returns, but that is where you need to start. Once you can
   identify where your customers are on the spectrum of return behavior
   you can take action.

   For example, are they exploiting a generous return policy, or have they
   been making purchase decisions with incomplete or faulty information?
   Another important area to support analysis is “customer listening,”
   particularly in the form of online reviews. Once you know why someone
   is returning, only then can you personalize the returns experience.
   While returns don’t have any impact on credit scoring, there are
   mechanisms being tested in the industry to score individuals and
   products based on their return factor.

   Given how expensive returns have become for retailers, they are a
   critical missing piece of the Customer Lifetime Value equation.
   Ultimately, to mitigate the havoc that Serial Returners have wreaked on
   the industry, retailers will need to better understand who and why
   these customers are returning in such high quantity and frequency.
   Having data that provides a detailed and comprehensive view of a
   customer’s return behavior will reveal opportunities to alleviate the
   rising costs of sustaining them as customers.

   Retailers are swimming in this raw data. It’s time to put it to work,
   because if you’re going to start “firing” your customers, it should be
   selective and used as a last resort.

     * French artist @JR gave WWD an inside look at his work – including
       the project that some said would get him killed.⁣ ⁣ JR is at the
       Brooklyn Museum in the days ahead of a major show, “Chronicles,”
       which surveys his complete body of work for the first time in North
       America. ⁣ JR challenged stereotypes by highlighting humanity
       through specificity.⁣ ⁣ For “Face to Face” he and artist friend
       Marco photographed Israelis and Palestinians who worked in the same
       professions — two actors, two sculptors, two security guards, two
       teachers — again with each posing how they imagined the other would
       see them. The artists pasted the dual images on the wall. JR struck
       up conversations with people passing by as a cameraman documented;
       the viewers had trouble figuring out who was from where.⁣ ⁣ “Only
       art can bring you to that complexity and paradox of things,” he
       says. “That made me realize that the people become the best
       spokesperson about the work because they’re from there. It really
       made me realize the power of the community and how they take the
       project forward,” he adds.⁣ ⁣ Tap the link in bio for more. ⁣ ⁣

       French artist @JR gave WWD an inside look at his work – including
       the project that some said would get him killed.⁣ ⁣ JR is at the
       Brooklyn Museum in the days ahead of a major show, “Chronicles,”
       which surveys his complete body of work for the first time in North
       America. ⁣ JR challenged stereotypes by highlighting humanity
       through specificity.⁣ ⁣ For “Face to Face” he and artist friend
       Marco photographed Israelis and Palestinians who worked in the same
       professions — two actors, two sculptors, two security guards, two
       teachers — again with each posing how they imagined the other would
       see them. The artists pasted the dual images on the wall. JR struck
       up conversations with people passing by as a cameraman documented;
       the viewers had trouble figuring out who was from where.⁣ ⁣ “Only
       art can bring you to that complexity and paradox of things,” he
       says. “That made me realize that the people become the best
       spokesperson about the work because they’re from there. It really
       made me realize the power of the community and how they take the
       project forward,” he adds.⁣ ⁣ Tap the link in bio for more. ⁣ ⁣

   Joseph Miller and David Fishbein have opened a men’s store at Platform,
   the shopping and dining experience in Culver City, Calif., that the two
   created in 2016 via their real estate company, Runyon Group. The
   Optimist, as they’ve called it, officially opens its doors Friday.

   “About a year ago, we got to this point where we couldn’t find a men’s
   wear store that we were excited about anymore,” Fishbein said.
   “Everything is streetwear with these crazy appliqué bomber and
   drop-crotch pants. Or it was the opposite end where it was super
   conservative. There was nothing really speaking to the L.A. guy. We
   were like, since no one else is doing it out there, maybe we need to be
   crazy and get into the retail business ourselves, even at a time when
   everyone is trying to leave the multilabel industry.

   “Now at three-and-a-half years old, Platform has really come into its
   own where we’ve seen retail sales honestly go triple in the last year
   and a half,” he continued. “And that’s taking place at the same time
   while retail globally is going through this completely huge change,
   where brands you never thought would have issues are all of a sudden
   filing for bankruptcy. Brands that have been heritage brands for years
   and years are all of a sudden losing favor. Meanwhile, we are here
   trying to build up this new neighborhood and trying to figure out what
   pieces we can put in here that continue to grow [Platform] and make it
   a very special part of the L.A. community.”

   Considering that retail climate, why open a brick-and-mortar?

   “People have become so technologically dependent, the Amazons of the
   world,” he said. “There’s so many convenient and amazing things that
   technology brings, but you are kind of losing that personal touch
   point. We still think that brick-and-mortar is the best place to do
   that. It’s also a big reason that Joey and I focus so much on our staff
   and the hospitality element of the store. It’s not just about having
   really cool product and displaying it nicely. How do we make you feel
   when you come into the store? How are you greeted? Do you feel
   comfortable like this is a place where you want to spend time
   regardless whether you’re going to drop a lot of money? We just want
   you to feel like this is your club house.”

   As Platform continues to grow, The Optimist is the first of the many
   new concepts the duo is working on. Other initiatives include projects
   in food and wellness. They’re building a new office building down the
   street that will bring the entire Platform neighborhood to five acres
   and a quarter of a billion dollars in development by the time it’s
   completed, in about three to four years, Miller said.

   “Before anyone thought that this was a successful place, we thought it
   was,” Miller said of Platform. “We thought it would do well. So, we
   tried to buy up as much as we could.”

   The Optimist is a passion project of sorts, they shared, and they
   traveled the world with stylist Julie Feingold, to bring back
   international pieces from France, Italy, Mexico and England. (Feingold
   is also helping with an in-store styling service.) There are more than
   20 exclusive labels, ranging in price generally between $60 and $1,800,
   that are not found anywhere else in the U.S.

   “Clothes are kind of country-less and borderless,” Miller said. “Good
   style is good style. And we wanted to find things from all over that
   spoke to us and spoke to this vision we wanted. By going further out we
   were able to find things that people would be coming here and
   uncovering for the first time.”

   “We wanted to go to that L.A. guy that cares about fashion, cares about
   trend but most importantly cares about style and having stuff that is
   going to be consistently relevant in their wardrobe versus something
   they can wear for a few months,” Fishbein added.

   From the clothing to the furniture, everything in the store — which was
   designed by Jeremiah Brent — is shoppable.

   “It’s the idea of putting together what an L.A. lifestyle looks like
   from the interior design to the clothing that you wear to the scents to
   the optical to the watches,” shared Miller. They’re providing vintage
   watches, priced between $800 and $5,000. “It’s not a bunch of new
   stainless-steel Rolex watches. It’s super interesting watches that have
   lived a life. And instead of being presented in a dusty old vintage
   storeroom, they are presented in this context with all of the clothes,
   all of the furniture as one sort of idea about what Los Angeles living
   looks like in 2019 and beyond hopefully.”

   The entire endeavor has been fulfilling, they said.

   “It’s been the whole journey of diving into something you have no idea
   about and is completely foreign,” Fishbein said. “You can totally flop
   on your face, and that’s still a huge possibility. This still can flop
   on its face.…Things are still unknown. But that unknown nature has
   always been something that’s been exciting to us of going someplace
   where nobody else has gone.”

The Four Personas of a Serial Returner

Navjit Bhasin, ceo of Newmine, discusses the four different personas of a
Serial Returner.

   What goes through your mind as you return a purchase? A quick search on
   Reddit will reveal hundreds of consumer discussions ranging from their
   anxieties of being prevented from purchasing from their favorite
   retailers to their lack of guilt over taking full advantage of the
   liberal return policies most retailers have adopted in recent years.

   Most recently, there’s been a conversational spike around: “How many
   returns is too many?” Or, “Am I going to be banned for ‘abusing the
   return policy’?”

   The rising fear among customers over being banned is to be expected.
   Retailers have begun to recognize that free and easy returns are
   causing significant damage to their bottom line. For example, Asos
   famously changed their return policy this year with a special caveat:
   “If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn’t sit
   right…then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated
   accounts.”

   And Asos is not alone. Amazon, Best Buy and Net-a-porter have all
   instituted similar policies. There are many significant costs that rise
   with product returns. For example, Statista estimates that return
   deliveries alone will cost $550 billion by 2020, and that doesn’t
   include the labor and disposition costs. It’s no surprise that
   retailers are starting to fight back against rising returns, with some
   retailers instituting an outright ban of customers who return what they
   deem to be excessive amounts.

   Those customers are known as the dreaded “Serial Returners.”

   Banning a serial returner impacts more than that individual customer.
   It diminishes the overall brand value and makes your customers angry —
   or worse, afraid to shop with you. The result is that customers become
   wary and unsure of how retailers define returns exploitative behavior.
   One typical comment on Yelp: “A consumer shouldn’t have to calculate
   their return behaviors in order to maintain their shopping freedom.”

   We agree and believe that there are better alternatives to address
   Serial Returners than instituting draconian return policies that cut
   off those who exploit lax return policies from future purchases. The
   ability to identify who they are and why they return is an opportunity
   to learn and grow as a business. Analyzing their behavior is the first
   step to discouraging exploitative behavior without sacrificing customer
   experience and is an important component of overall returns reduction.

   Remember the 80/20 Rule

   Before we discuss the classification of Serial Returners, let’s first
   address your best customers based on Customer Lifetime Value. These are
   your customers that buy frequently, return frequently, but come back to
   buy even more. If 80 percent of your sales are due to 20 percent of
   your shoppers, there’s a good chance they’re making some significant
   returns just due to the sheer volume at which they purchase. According
   to a former Zappos executive, “our best customers have the highest
   return rates, but they are also the ones that spend the most money with
   us and are our most profitable customers.” These customers are also
   more likely to be advocates for your brand, spreading word-of-mouth and
   e-WOM.

   The Four Serial Returner Personas

   While Serial Returners are an easy scapegoat for high return rates, not
   all Serial Returners are fraudulent or profligate. We have identified
   four major categories of “Serial Returner Personas.” When you identify
   which category your returner falls under, then you can take meaningful
   action to reduce the amount or frequency at which they return.

   Compulsive Shoppers

   Impulse purchases can be extremely lucrative for apparel retailers,
   particularly online. But when impulse turns into compulsion, things get
   risky. People with compulsive buying behavior often feel guilt and
   remorse after a shopping binge and return products to allay the guilt.
   These shoppers can be identified by their habit of frequently
   purchasing large quantities of items only to return one, if not all, of
   the products.

   You probably know someone who has purchased an outfit to wear for a
   night out only to return it the next day. This common practice is a
   form of return fraud that occurs frequently for luxury products. It’s
   also seen in consumer electronics, for example, where shoppers will buy
   products for the Big Game only to return the next day.

   Social Media Wardrobers

   Driven by influencer-culture and social media, some shoppers are buying
   and wearing outfits #fortheinsta. In a day and age where everyone is
   expected to cultivate a personal brand, up to 10 percent of shoppers
   surveyed admit to buying clothes they’re planning to snap and send
   back. While #OOTD (“outfit of the day”) posts can provide some
   marketing, the cost of customers leveraging your store as a “free
   rental service” can swiftly outweigh the benefit, as Asos recognized.

   Bracketers

   Bracketing entails purchasing multiple versions of a style/item
   (different sizes, different colors, etc.) with the intent to return
   most of them, essentially turning their bedroom into a dressing room.
   Because e-commerce has made it so easy for shoppers to be indecisive
   without shouldering the financial burden, 40 percent of customers
   engage in some form of bracketing.

   Product Returns Are an Opportunity to Create Positive Customer
   Experience

   Once you stop painting your Serial Returners with a broad brush, you
   can take meaningful actions to improve the customer experience for the
   returner as well as your broader customer base. Knowing where on the
   spectrum your returner falls will enable you to make decisions on how
   to personalize the customer shopping journey, such as adjusting
   offerings or removing features that drive impulse purchases. You may
   even decide to customize the return journey as well, by deciding to
   gently rescind free return shipping privileges to those who are
   returning excessively.

   For example, if you’ve identified a customer is a Compulsive
   Shopper/Returner, you may decide to remove them from marketing e-mails
   or remove “scarcity notifications” (“Only a couple left!”) from their
   online experience. If you realize that you’re a hot brand with Social
   Media Wardrobers, you could pilot a rental program and market it to
   this segment of customers. If you have high numbers of Bracketers, you
   may invest in fit analytics technology or use available customer buying
   and return data to guide size selection so that customers can feel more
   confident with their choices during the consideration phase. And for
   your model customers, reward and incentivize their good behavior.

   With All these Serial Returners, How Do You Reduce Returns?

   In order to reduce returns while dealing with a complex variety of
   consumer return behavior, it’s important to have a holistic approach to
   data mining and analytics. It’s rare that all returns relevant data is
   analyzed in a comprehensive fashion to identify the root cause of
   certain returns, but that is where you need to start. Once you can
   identify where your customers are on the spectrum of return behavior
   you can take action.

   For example, are they exploiting a generous return policy, or have they
   been making purchase decisions with incomplete or faulty information?
   Another important area to support analysis is “customer listening,”
   particularly in the form of online reviews. Once you know why someone
   is returning, only then can you personalize the returns experience.
   While returns don’t have any impact on credit scoring, there are
   mechanisms being tested in the industry to score individuals and
   products based on their return factor.

   Given how expensive returns have become for retailers, they are a
   critical missing piece of the Customer Lifetime Value equation.
   Ultimately, to mitigate the havoc that Serial Returners have wreaked on
   the industry, retailers will need to better understand who and why
   these customers are returning in such high quantity and frequency.
   Having data that provides a detailed and comprehensive view of a
   customer’s return behavior will reveal opportunities to alleviate the
   rising costs of sustaining them as customers.

   Retailers are swimming in this raw data. It’s time to put it to work,
   because if you’re going to start “firing” your customers, it should be
   selective and used as a last resort.
