Don’t leave me!!!

   9 Dec

   Hello all! I am in the process of attempting to switch over to self
   hosted blogging…..

   I changed the nameservers but they say it takes 24 hours so I have no
   idea if it worked. I don’t want to leave you hanging in case it DID
   work. I will put up the link to my new blog when it is available.

   If you like what you see, please follow me on bloglovin or your
   personal blog reader once it’s switched over.

   And any advice to make this process easier will be much appreciated!!!

   Also, if you self hosted, any suggestions on an affordable blog
   designer?? Thanks!!


   Here’s a picture of my cat to hold you over.

RX Bar Review

   8 Dec

   I have another great Paleo, grain free, refined sugar free snack
   options to share with you!

   If you haven’t already heard of RxBars, you should go to their site to
   check them out. It is a grain free, gluten free, dairy free, soy free,
   everything artificial- free protein/meal replacement bar.

   IMG_3421[1]

   “RxBars are handmade with a passion devoted to ensuring the highest
   standards of quality.  There are no misleading filler ingredients in
   our bars — only natural, quality ingredients that provide functional
   nutrition and satisfy hunger.

   Each bar contains no more than 8 ingredients, all of which conform to
   the standards of the Paleo Diet”

   They are all made of REAL, natural ingredients, so you don’t have to
   worry about artificial sugars and whey protein like most protein bars.
   Like I’ve said I used to eat protein bars, shakes and all sorts of
   snacks but not after I took a glance at the ingredients list. I also
   used to eat a lot of protein shakes with whey protein but in all
   reality I’d really rather just eat real food.

   These bars are great when you need something whole and natural but are
   in a pinch, as I was when I was out shopping the other day……satisfied
   my hunger without a trip to the mall food court! Excellent. They taste
   AMAZING!! They send me four kinds: chocolate coconut, coffee cacao,
   apple cinnamon and blueberry. I thought I would love the coffee one,
   but it wasn’t my favorite. The chocolate coconut one hit it out of the
   park. I’m loving coconut anything lately. The apple cinnamon was a
   close second. I just the taste of figs, which these bars use as figs
   AND dates (which are in Lara bars). Not that Larabars aren’t awesome,
   cause they are. But the taste of figs make these bars stand out from
   the crowd. It was great for when I was in a pinch and needed something
   yummy without running to the drive through!

   IMG_3607[1]

   And that’s exactly what I would use these bars for. When I need
   something quality in an emergency. Unfortunately, I experienced quite a
   sugar crash about 30-40 minutes after eating the thing. Even though the
   figs and dates are natural sugars, sugar is sugar. And it affects my
   body negatively, as I have found out. It didn’t help that I ate the Rx
   Bar on THE day after my 21 Day Sugar Detox was over. So that may have
   had something to do with it.

   All in all, I would buy these bars again because I like that they have
   quality ingredients, and I need things for when I’m traveling and want
   to stay eating clean. However, I probably wouldn’t eat them on a
   regular basis because of the high amount of sugar and the caloric
   content (about 250-300 calories per bar). They taste amazing though, I
   highly suggest you try them if you’re looking for a whole food option
   for on the go!

   OH! I almost forgot- another great thing about these bars is they have
   this cool little re-sealable packaging! So even though they contain a
   lot of calories, you can eat half and put the rest back. How many times
   have you opened a Larabar and said “I’ll only eat half”. Yeaaaa right!
   These great little packages make it so easy! I actually used it the
   other day and ate half of one after my workout for two days in a row.

   What are you favorite snacks for when you’re traveling?

   Do you eat protein bars?

Buttery Parsnip and Sweet Potato Mash

   4 Dec

   It was an amazing day when I discovered that I could essentially turn
   any root vegetable into a “mash”. All these years mashed potatoes have
   stolen the show…but if you think about it….sweet potatoes, carrots,
   parsnips, beets. The possibilities are endless. Over the summer I made
   mashed beets with coconut butter. I don’t think I blogged about it, but
   it was good. It was the only way I could get my husband to eat beets.

   I spent a considerable amount of time deciding whether to use lard or
   ghee in this mash. I decided the ghee would give it a nice buttery
   taste, reminiscent of mashed potatoes. OMGHEE!!!  Get it? So good. The
   leftovers are sitting in my fridge now taunting me!!! Replace your
   traditional mashed potatoes with this dish and you will never go back.
   Mashed potatoes are boring. Ick.

   IMG_3752[1]

   Parsnip and Sweet Potato Mash

   3 medium parsnips, peeled and diced

   1/2 cup cooked sweet potato (about half of one large?? mine were
   Thanksgiving leftovers so I don’t know how many I started with!)

   1/2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary

   1 small clove of garlic

   1 tablespoon full fat canned coconut milk

   1/2 tablespoon ghee

   salt and pepper to taste

   1. Prepare (peel and dice) sweet potatoes and parsnips and rosemary.

   2. Fill a pot with your parsnips and water and put on the stove to
   boil. Bring to a boil and cook until fork tender (roughly 10 minutes).
   If you start with an uncooked sweet potato, I like this method to cook
   it.

   IMG_3755[1]

   3. Place everything in a food processor and blend it up. You may have
   to push down the sides to get everything mixed up a couple of times.

   ^^New can of coconut milk I now order of Vitacost. It’s BPA free and
   way cheaper than the $3 cans at the store.

   Sooooo good! Can’t wait to eat those leftovers! This is a must make.

   IMG_3751[1]

   Dinner last night….beef roast, broccoli and mash! Omg.

   What veggies do you like with your dinner?

   Have you ever tried a different type of “mashed” vegetable?

Inside out and Back Again Book Unit Ideas

   3 Dec

   Chances are sometime this year whether you’re a teacher, work in a
   school, know someone who’s a teacher or have kids you have heard the
   words “Common Core”. What is it? A new set of standards that the
   country is implementing to get all states on the same page about what
   is taught in schools. This means all states have the same standards,
   instead of separate standards for each state like it used to be.

   The common core standards are designed to make underperforming U.S
   students more college and career ready. I believe they are  more
   authentic and will be more helpful than the old standards for meeting
   that goal.

   Some teachers are irritated with my state, New York, because they have
   gone ahead and designed whole book units on books for each grade level
   and “suggested” to schools to teach these units. This takes away
   creativity of the teacher as she is no longer able to design her own
   lessons. No one wants to be a robot and just follow a script, which is
   what essentially the NYS modules are.

   inside-out-back-again

   My school district has not mandated that we use these units, however I
   really liked one of the books, Inside out and Back Again by Thannha Lai
   so I decided to go ahead and teach it. I haven’t followed the scripted
   lessons word for word; I have taken what I could use and implemented
   changes that will fit the needs of my students. Okay, since I’m
   probably boring you with teacher speak, here are some ideas that I used
   to spice it up.

   1. Include websites and more supported material on Vietnam that is
   student friendly.

   Many of the articles and websites that the state used were dry. So here
   are some that I used to spice it up.

   Vietnam War Facts

   Fall of Saigon Video

   Helicopter Pilot recalls Fall of Saigon

   Sweet refugee stimulation video game <<<< really cooL!

   Refugee Background

   2. Real life correspondence with refugees.

   The school I used to work at was an area that serviced a lot of ESL and
   refugee students. I got in touch with a friend (thanks Judy!) and we
   organized a little “pen pal” type activity. My students are so excited
   to see what our refugee student has to say in response to questions
   they created! We’re reading them tomorrow in class. This will help with
   their refugee research for the final project. I also reached out to
   local agencies and organized an office supply drive at my school. Some
   refugees at a center in Buffalo are having a hard time with supplies
   for applying for jobs and learning English. I organized a drive at my
   school and I will deliver the office supplies to the agency when the
   drive is over. Another great real life connection!

   3.Differentiated final project

   The final project of the module was the write a poem. I offered them
   multiple choices utilizing my school’s 1:1 I pad situation. They will
   use apps like Instablend, Piccollage, Videolicious, and Podomatic to
   create these projects.

   Final Projects for Inside out and Back Again

   I can’t wait to share the projects when they are completed! This blog
   topic was way far off from my regular topics but I am excited about the
   ideas I tried and just wanted to share! Thanks for reading!

   If you’re a teacher, how do you feel about the common core?

   Does your state have scripted lessons? Would you follow it?

Holiday Baking Wish List

   2 Dec

   Anticipating the shorter-than-usual holiday season this year flying by
   before I can even blink, you better believe I was in the kitchen,
   blasting Christmas music while baking cookies and putting up
   decorations the DAY after Thanksgiving.

   It was REALLY tempting to go Black Friday shopping…all the ads, the
   emails, the people posting on Facebook. The only thing I bought Friday
   was a freezer in anticipation of the 1/4 of a cow we’re getting later
   in the month. And it felt good! Normally I just end up buying stuff for
   me that I don’t really need. I get anxiety thinking about all the
   people. I’d rather just buy stuff online honestly. People are boasting
   and bragging about all the money they “saved”….however I didn’t spend
   any so I win!!!

   I baked a couple of batches of cookies this past weekend, and I am
   going full force now trying to make a list of the holiday cookies I
   plan to make. This weekend I tried out a couple winners that will
   definitely be repeated…especially these:

   Coconut Macaroons with raspberry chia jam from Oh She Glows

   macaroons

   Also, I made these for my husband and his friends while they were out
   hunting. They were VERY rich and chocolate-ly. They were so rich it
   almost easy to not eat the whole batch when they came out. Just kidding
   I still ate like 3. But it was a valiant effort.

   Triple Chocolate Grain Free Cookies

   Photo(1)

   Mmmmmmm Cookies.


   So, thanks for Pinterest, I have quite the list going regarding the
   recipes I’d like to try for Christmas cookies. However I’ll have to
   narrow it down to 2-3 recipes because baking, especially Paleo baking,
   can get expensive!!!

   I found this spritz recipe in an old cookbook that I plan on making for
   the cookie press my mom got me last year! I have no idea how to use
   that thing but Google University should be able to help out a bit.

   image

   Here are some others I have been eyeing:


   Gluten Free white chocolate cranberry cookies

   Paleo Thin Mints & Samoas

   Pumpkin Gingerbread Cake with Maple Vanilla Frosting

   Joyful Almond Coconut Chocolate Bites

   Chocolate Chip Cookies

   I also plan on making some homemade goodie bag Christmas presents for
   people, including these recipes (sorry for the spoiler if you’re one of
   the ones who gets one……. Smile ) I want to put them in mason jars like
   so:

   jars

   Salted Caramel Bacon Bark

   Holiday Nut Mix

   Pretzel Gift Idea

   Almond Cherry Bark


   How will I decide?!?!?!


   What cookies are you making for the holidays?!?!

Thanksgiving 2013

   30 Nov

   This year I have countless of things to be thankful for…..but honestly
   I try to make being thankful a habit that I practice all year, and not
   just on Thanksgiving! This allows me to focus on the more important
   matter at hand:food.

   IMG_3692[1]

   This year was awesome!!!! Although I didn’t get to fulfill my dream of
   hosting a full Thanksgiving dinner in our new home (I’m sure I will
   someday) I did prepare a couple of dishes for dinner at my in-laws. I
   bought Danielle Walker’s (author of Against All Grain) e-book Thankful
   on a whim the other week and decided to try out a few of her recipes.
   I’ve made a couple of her Paleo treats before and I was a fan. Normally
   I pick out a few recipes from different places to try, but I knew I
   wanted to make green bean casserole…and then I saw the Paleo pecan pie
   and made the decision to try that as well. I’ve never made pecan pie…or
   even eaten it for that matter. It was a hit! I am planning on making it
   again for Christmas, but I’ll have to increase the amount of filling
   and decrease the amount of crust. There seemed to be a lot of crust for
   the amount of filling that was made. But the flavor was amazing!!!

   IMG_3654[1]

   Rolling out the dough was kind of hard- the almond flour makes it
   really crumbly. But it worked out!

   I also made her green bean casserole, sans the mushrooms and onions to
   cater to everyone’s tastes. It was also a recipe I’ll make again.

   IMG_3697[1]

   We weren’t planning on it, but I also tried the recipe for homemade
   cranberry sauce. I have never had the canned cranberry sauce on
   Thanksgiving….it never looked appetizing to me. This recipe was simple
   enough. Although we agreed it could have used more sweetener than it
   called for. I was fine with it since I am used to unsweetened desserts.

   IMG_3693[1]

   The turkey was literally the best turkey I’ve ever eaten!!!! I don’t
   know what my MIL did but it was so juicy. My plate: turkey, sweet
   potatoes, green bean casserole, and cranberry sauce. I went back for
   seconds, obvi. And pecan pie for dessert.


   IMG_3698[1]

   And….it looked a lot more like Christmas than Thanksgiving over here.
   Winter is coming early. Wonderful….

   IMG_3695[1]

   Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday. I feel like a bad blogger as I
   have been neglecting the blog world since I’ve been on vacation. I
   promise I’ll get back on track this week!

   What was your favorite thing on your Thanksgiving plate?
