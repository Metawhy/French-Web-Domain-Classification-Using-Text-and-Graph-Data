   QBSWebService

   The following operations are supported. For a formal definition, please
   review the Service Description.

     __________________________________________________________________

This web service is using http://tempuri.org/ as its default namespace.

Recommendation: Change the default namespace before the XML Web service is
made public.

   Each XML Web service needs a unique namespace in order for client
   applications to distinguish it from other services on the Web.
   http://tempuri.org/ is available for XML Web services that are under
   development, but published XML Web services should use a more permanent
   namespace.

   Your XML Web service should be identified by a namespace that you
   control. For example, you can use your company's Internet domain name
   as part of the namespace. Although many XML Web service namespaces look
   like URLs, they need not point to actual resources on the Web. (XML Web
   service namespaces are URIs.)

   For XML Web services creating using ASP.NET, the default namespace can
   be changed using the WebService attribute's Namespace property. The
   WebService attribute is an attribute applied to the class that contains
   the XML Web service methods. Below is a code example that sets the
   namespace to "http://microsoft.com/webservices/":

   C#
[WebService(Namespace="http://microsoft.com/webservices/")]
public class MyWebService {
    // implementation
}

   Visual Basic
<WebService(Namespace:="http://microsoft.com/webservices/")> Public Class MyWebS
ervice
    ' implementation
End Class

   C++
[WebService(Namespace="http://microsoft.com/webservices/")]
public ref class MyWebService {
    // implementation
};

   For more details on XML namespaces, see the W3C recommendation on
   Namespaces in XML.

   For more details on WSDL, see the WSDL Specification.

   For more details on URIs, see RFC 2396.
