   RescueTime tracks exactly how you spend your time on your digital
   devices. Everything you do is automatically categorized so you can
   quickly see the time you spend on specific apps, websites, and projects
   and gauge your daily productivity.

Goals, real-time alerts, and weekly email summary

   Set RescueTime Goals for how you want to spend your time—whether that
   means less time on social media or writing for 2 hours a day—and then
   track your progress with Alerts and our weekly summary email.

FocusTime distraction blocker

   FocusTime blocks distracting websites when you need it most. Set a
   focused session for first thing in the morning to start the day off
   right or block sites automatically when you’re distracted.

Customizable work hours and in-depth reports

   Set custom work hours to separate your working and non-working hours,
   optimize your most productive time, protect yourself from burnout, and
   get alerted when you’re doing too much work outside of work.

Guided workday habits coaching

   RescueTime helps coach you through your biggest workday issues, whether
   that means rebuilding your focus, cutting down on multitasking, or
   reducing your time spent on email, chat, and your phone.

Offline time tracking and daily highlights

   automatically prompts you to enter meetings, calls, and other
