Data drives results

   As a real-time data solutions company, Kochava provides sophisticated
   tools to optimize your marketing and harness your data for growth.
   Because we understand it is the very core of our business, and yours,
   we take data and data privacy very seriously.

   You can find information on this page for each of the following data
   privacy topics:
     * Information security standards
     * General privacy policy for website visitors
     * GDPR
     * Consent Management
     * Service Level standards

Information Security Standards


Information Security Management System

   Kochava adheres to ISO/IEC 27001 standards, which encompasses security
   practices throughout all levels of the Kochava organization. Detailed
   information regarding ISO/IEC 27001 standards may be found by visiting
   the ISO.org website
   at http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics.htm.

Data Security In-Transit/At-Rest

   Kochava employs industry standard encryption and authentication
   technologies, such as SSL/TLS and SSH, to protect data while it is in
   transit over public networks. Kochava employs industry standard
   encryption technology to protect data while it is at rest on third
   party systems (e.g., Google Cloud services) and industry standard
   firewall technology to protect data while it is at rest on its own
   systems.

Data Center Security

   Kochava processes and stores data on servers located in the United
   States. Google Cloud services provides all of public-facing Kochava
   data ingestion points and public web services. All data processing and
   storage occurs within high security data centers that are, at a
   minimum, certified SSAE16 Type II SOC 2. Additional information
   regarding Kochava data center security standards and statements may be
   found by visiting the following
   websites: www.tierpoint.com/resources/compliance and https://cloud.goog
   le.com/security.

Backups

   In the event that a client utilizes “Kochava Intelligence” tools,
   Kochava stores an unmodified copy of all client data at the moment of
   ingestion in a secure offsite facility (e.g. Google BigQuery).
   Otherwise, Kochava retains multiple redundant copies of data in its
   production facilities on physically separate servers.

Risk Assessment

   Kochava conducts ongoing internal security audits of all aspects of its
   organization. Kochava completes an audit of each aspect of the
   organization, including its physical security, network security, and
   security policies and procedures on a quarterly basis. Kochava also
   contracts with an independent third party to perform annual compliance
   audits and security tests on its physical and logical systems.

Website Visitor Privacy Policy

   The Kochava website is a resource center for its business clients.
   Clients’ use of the Kochava website is governed by individually
   executed contracts between the client and Kochava. These contracts
   place a number of data privacy and processing obligations on the
   parties. However, you don’t have to be a client for us to honor your
   privacy! We understand you may be browsing the website to learn more
   about Kochava or how it might be able to help your business harness
   data for growth. If you click the link below, you’ll be taken to a page
   dedicated to those of you who are not yet clients and are simply
   browsing the Kochava website. The page presents our Website Visitor
   Privacy Policy as a Q&A so you can easily navigate how Kochava
   addresses your privacy.

   Website Visitor Privacy Policy

GDPR

   The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) creates consistent data
   protection rules across Europe. It applies to companies that are based
   in the EU and global companies like Kochava that process personal data
   about individuals in the EU. Kochava is, and will continue to be,
   compliant with all data privacy laws across the globe. We are committed
   to complying with GDPR legislation and collaborating with partners to
   facilitate compliance.

   We thought it would be helpful to provide the context upon which
   Kochava delivers its services to clients in order for you to better
   understand how Kochava complies with GDPR and treats client data.

   Kochava provides a number of different services to clients:
     * Kochava Measurement – a comprehensive set of data analytics and
       attribution tools
     * Kochava Collective – a mobile audience marketplace
     * Free App Analytics – a limited set of free data analytics and
       attribution tools, made available in return for your contribution
       of data to the Kochava Collective marketplace

   Kochava Measurement
   The characteristic Kochava Measurement client is a company that has
   created an app and wants to measure every aspect of an advertising
   campaign promoting it. The Kochava Measurement client enters into a
   contractual relationship with Kochava, which allows the client to embed
   Kochava software (an “SDK”) into its app. The client customizes the SDK
   to collect certain data derived from the app. Kochava processes this
   data on behalf of the client and visualizes it on a private dashboard
   for the client’s analysis. The client pays Kochava a fee for providing
   this service. The data remains the exclusive property of the client at
   all times.

   Kochava Collective
   The characteristic Kochava Collective client is a company that has
   created an app and wants to advertise it to specific audiences. The
   Kochava Collective client enters into a contractual relationship with
   Kochava in order to access a mobile audience marketplace and use the
   data therein for advertising purposes. The client browses the
   marketplace and builds custom audiences based on data attributes
   associated with mobile devices. The client then chooses among
   partnering ad networks to activate an ad campaign directed to those
   mobile devices. Kochava is paid a fee for providing this service.
   Kochava populates the marketplace with data from its Free App Analytics
   clients and third-party suppliers.

   Free App Analytics
   The characteristic Free App Analytics (“FAA”) client is a company that
   has created an app and wants to measure the performance of an
   advertising campaign promoting it. The FAA client enters into a
   contractual relationship with Kochava, which allows the client to embed
   Kochava software (an “SDK”) into its app. The client customizes the SDK
   to collect certain data derived from the app. Kochava processes this
   data on behalf of the client and visualizes it on a private dashboard
   for the client’s analysis. Instead of the client paying Kochava a fee
   for this service, the FAA client allows Kochava to use the data for
   Kochava’s own purposes. There are two distinct differences between
   Kochava Measurement and FAA: (1) The FAA client has access to a limited
   set of data analytics tools, whereas the Kochava Measurement client has
   access to the full suite of tools; and (2) the FAA client receives the
   service free of charge in exchange for granting first-party data rights
   to Kochava, whereas the Kochava Measurement client pays Kochava a fee
   for services without granting additional data rights.

   Kochava does not, and will not, determine the purposes or means of
   processing personal data of European data subjects for any of its
   clients. As such, Kochava operates exclusively as a Data Processor
   under GDPR across each of its business units.
   BUSINESS UNIT ROLE LEGAL BASIS
   Kochava Measurement Data Processor Kochava processes data on behalf of
   its clients.
   Kochava Collective n/a The Kochava Collective audience marketplace does
   not include data derived from EU data subjects.
   Free App Analytics Data Processor Kochava processes data on behalf of
   its clients. Kochava does not transfer data derived from EU data
   subjects into the Kochava Collective audience marketplace.


   In its capacity as a Data Processor, Kochava adheres to the rules of
   the GDPR as follows:

Data Protection by Design

   The Kochava Measurement and FAA service platforms (“Platform”) are
   designed to enable clients to:
     * Determine which personal data the Platform processes;
     * Limit the collection of personal data to that which is adequate,
       relevant, and necessary for the purpose of which they are
       processed;
     * Manage the retention periods of personal data; and
     * Destroy personal data.

Data Protection by Default

   The Platform is designed to:
     * Process personal information in conformance to the instructions
       provided by the client;
     * Collect only the personal data that are necessary for fulfilling
       the purposes of which they are processed;
     * Make personal data accessible only to a limited number of people
       whose job requires such access; and
     * Ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing
       personal data.

Collection of “Sensitive” Personal Data

   Kochava contractually prohibits its clients from utilizing the Platform
   to collect, process, or otherwise handle sensitive personal data.

Data Retention

   Kochava does not keep personal data any longer than is necessary for
   the purposes for which it is being processed. Kochava deletes personal
   data after a client’s contract has expired or has been terminated.

Incident Response

   Kochava will continue to promptly inform clients of incidents involving
   personal data in line with the data incident terms in our current (and
   any subsequently updated) agreements. Kochava maintains, and will
   continue to invest in, advanced threat detection and avoidance
   technologies, as well as a rigorous 24/7 incident management program to
   help identify and respond to security or privacy events (and any
   personal data breaches under the GDPR) without delay.

Third-Party Audit

   Kochava is audited annually by an independent third party against GDPR
   and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standards.

International Transfers

   Kochava ingests client data to its cloud servers from locations across
   the world. Upon ingestion, Kochava transfers the data to its secure
   processing facility located in the United States. Kochava is certified
   under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, which is a legal mechanism
   to enable the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area
   to the US, where certified organizations guarantee to provide a level
   of protection in line with EU data protection law. See more here:

   https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnEHAA0&status=
   Active
   Kochava also offers clients EU-approved Model Contract Clauses upon
   request.

   Kochava will, in addition, continue to monitor the evolution of
   international data-transfer mechanisms under the GDPR, and is committed
   to having an ongoing lawful basis for data transfers in compliance with
   applicable data protection laws.

Subprocessing

   Kochava does not subcontract any of its processing operations to a
   subprocessor in the absence of a written agreement which contractually
   obligates the subprocessor to adhere to all applicable GDPR data
   processing requirements.

Opt-Out & Right to be Forgotten

   You may click here to be redirected to the Kochava web page dedicated
   to providing guidance on opting out of interest-based advertising.

   In order to protect your privacy, Kochava has engineered its systems to
   not collect identifying information such as email, name, and phone
   number. However, GDPR considers mobile device identifiers and IP
   addresses to be “personal information.” A mobile device identifier is a
   unique string of 30+ numbers associated with your device (e.g., cell
   phone). An IP address is a series of numbers separated by periods that
   identifies each computing device using a particular “Internet Protocol”
   at a given time to communicate over a network.

   If you are concerned that Kochava has this information, we will be
   happy to delete it from our systems upon request. You may submit a
   request to delete all your personal information by emailing Kochava at
   privacy@kochava.com or by contacting the legal department via telephone
   at 855-562-4282. However, please bear in mind that when you contact
   Kochava with such a request, because of the precautions we have
   proactively taken to protect your privacy, you are actually
   volunteering more personally identifying information to Kochava as a
   result of lodging the request than Kochava would have ever had prior to
   you initiating contact.

   Opt Out Policy

Additional Terms

   In its capacity as a processor of personal data, Kochava will ensure
   its contractual agreements with clients require the parties to adhere
   to the respective obligations of controllers and processors.
   Furthermore, Kochava will enter into data-processing agreements with
   clients where required.

Intelligent Consent Management

   To assist marketers with compliance, Kochava has developed Intelligent
   Consent Management, which sends a signal about user consent via the
   latest Kochava SDK.

   Intelligent Consent Management

Service Level Standards

   The Kochava Platform will operate and otherwise comply and function in
   all material respects on an uptime basis of 99.99% over a rolling
   annual basis. If an incident disrupts the client’s use of the Platform,
   then Kochava shall respond as follows:
     * Critical Priority Incident rendering the Platform inoperative:
       Kochava shall respond to Company within one hour of notice and
       immediately begin replicating and verifying the problem.
     * High Priority Incident degrading the operations and use of the
       Platform: Kochava shall respond to Company within four hours of
       notice and immediately begin replicating and verifying the problem.
     * Medium Priority Incident affecting the operations of, but not
       degrading, the Platform: Kochava shall respond to Company within
       six hours of notice and immediately begin identifying and verifying
       the problem during normal business hours.
     * Low Priority Incident having a minor impact on the operations of
       the Platform- Kochava shall respond to Company within eight hours
       of notice if alerted between 6:00 a.m. – 8:00 p.m. PST Monday
       through Friday and begin identifying and verifying the problem
       within two business days.

   This Privacy page was last updated April 1, 2019.

   †Listed certifications include those held by Kochava directly and those
   held by our cloud and data center service providers in so far as those
   certifications are applicable to our data processing and storage
   operations. For more information, contact privacy@kochava.com.

The role of A/B/n and multivariate testing in push messaging

   Marketing is as much about retargeting as it is about user acquisition.
   As is commonly known, the cost to acquire a new user is much more than
   to retain an existing customer. Whether a marketer is re-engaging
   valuable users or retargeting ones at risk for churn, crafting multiple
   messages to see which one drives results best is key to successful
   marketing.

   In this aspect of marketing, push messaging is a valuable marketing
   tool. While it enables marketers to reach specific audiences with
   personalized content, poorly executed push campaigns can also
   negatively influence a brand’s image and a user’s perception of an app.
   As a remedy, marketers commonly perform A/B/n testing, or multivariate
   analysis, to determine which content is most compelling to their
   audiences.

   A/B/n testing (where n is the number of variables being tested) can be
   as simple or as in depth as preferred, but it plays a pivotal role in
   understanding an audience’s perception of marketing message better. It
   also allows an audience to self-select what types of messaging they
   prefer to see.

   In-house multivariate testing can be incredibly resource intensive.
   Marketers often target multiple audience segments, and ideally, they
   would test the messaging for each. If a marketer is targeting 10
   different segments, each with 10 different variants, over 100 separate
   iterations must be weighted, balanced, and optimized against each
   other.

   A better approach is to use a push notification system that
   auto-optimizes campaigns in real time based on performance. This allows
   a marketer to reach an audience with as many variants as they choose
   per audience segment, without being concerned with the time investment
   of manually adjusting the weights based on performance.

   Using Kochava engagement, creating campaigns driven by
   auto-optimization ensures that messaging is based on users’ real-time
   responses.

Create a data-driven push campaign

   Marketers can define an audience in Analytics or upload their own list
   of device IDs. Push messaging is ideal for re-engaging users likely to
   churn. When defining an audience inside the Kochava platform, marketers
   can A/B test manually or choose to automate their multivariate testing.

A/B test messaging

   To simplify A/B/n testing, Kochava automatically optimizes toward the
   most successful message (variant), freeing the marketer to implement a
   large range of potential messaging variations without worrying about
   manually applying the prevailing message of the resulting data to their
   campaigns. The system has three machine learning algorithms to
   determine a winner. These include:

   Continuous A/B/n test
     * Continuous: constantly uses real-time feedback to adjust weighting
       based on the individual open rates of each variation

   Progressive A/B/n test
     * Progressive: waits 48 hours, and adjusts weights based on the
       relative success rates of the variants; re-adjusts every 24 hours,
       until one variant has been weighted to 100%.

   Full redirect A/B/n test
     * Full Redirect: waits for 72 hours, then picks one as the “winner”
       and gives it a 100% weighting

   Marketers can still manually set or shift weights of ongoing campaigns
   to match their own testing methodology, if needed.

What to test

   Marketers can test headlines and content messaging to observe what’s
   working or not. Additionally, they should be selective in their
   variants by only testing one or two elements each to clearly
   distinguish what’s most effective.

   A/B test:
     * Headlines
     * Push messaging content
     * Deep link destinations (view in Analytics)
     * Offers

   Often, in multivariate testing, there are several individual variants
   being tested, such as three different message types and three different
   headlines. The system then tests the variants together to see which
   combination works best.

   Engagement automatically tests based on one of the three configurations
   selected and operates under the best practices of:
     * Testing on the same day
     * Choosing winner on based 100% for best statistical significance

   Observe what content gets their attention. Is it a more personal
   message crafted based on their demographic? Is it a certain type of
   offer? Test messaging, see what prevails, modify, and then test again.

Measure, measure, measure

   Marketers can follow audiences down the funnel to see how they perform,
   and get further evidence on the success of the messaging that won in
   the multivariate testing. Every campaign is another attempt to refine
   content based on data, test what works, and see results in the form of
   conversions.
