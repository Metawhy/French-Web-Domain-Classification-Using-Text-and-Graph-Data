   A few years after the Star Wars prequel trilogy came out, after we had
   all had time to digest just how unsatisfying it had been, an
   independent filmmaker named Mike Stoklasa produced a series of online
   videos picking the movies apart, figuring out just exactly why Anakin,
   Jar Jar, computer Yoda and the rest bothered us so much. Published
   under the imprimatur of Red Letter Media, the videos are quirky and
   profane—and also masterpieces of film critique.

   There is no time to go over all of Stoklasa’s points here. Altogether,
   his reviews add up to four and a half hours, rivaling the actual
   trilogy in total running time. But one critique he had of Episode III:
   Revenge of the Sith has always stuck with me. In that movie, the stakes
   were meant to be so big—literally galactic in scale. Would the Republic
   hold on, or would they, as we all knew was inevitable, fall and be
   overthrown by a tyrannical empire? The movie was epic: with spectacular
   space battles, crushing betrayals, widespread assassinations and
   fate-deciding individual battles between the greatest warriors, all
   accompanied by a sweeping and majestic score by the inestimable John
   Williams. It was all supposed to mean so much.

   And yet, as Stoklasa points out, something was off about this
   particular galactic star war. If you look just a little bit closer, you
   will notice that, as grand as the stakes appear to be, the conduct and
   effects of the war do not extend much beyond a small handful of
   individuals. There are only a few dozen Jedi fighting on one side, and,
   by rule, two Sith on the other. Their armies are made up of literally
   disposable droids on one side, and nearly disposable clone troopers on
   the other. Most importantly, at few points is this galactic fight
   connected to the people that make up the galaxy, least of all on
   Coruscant, the capital planet itself.

   Stoklasa uses one scene in particular to show this point. As the now
   fallen Anakin leads a force of troopers to take over the Jedi Temple
   and kill all the Jedi-in-training children, it all seems so terrifying
   and important. And yet, even as the one-time hero is about to prove he
   has truly become Darth Vader, the scourge of the galaxy and a major
   player in a devastating galactic war, no one, not even the people all
   around him, notice at all. Rush hour traffic on Coruscant continues as
   usual, and Stoklasa highlights a single ship flying behind Anakin and
   inserts the caption, Average Joe, late for work.

   As I write this, the current galactic problem is the Brett Kavanaugh
   Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and the sexual assault allegations
   leveled against the nominee. The amount of ink, bandwidth and airtime
   being spent on this issue is staggering. Everyone has a take, and in
   order for those takes to gain an audience, they grow ever more
   grandiose. As the Kavanaugh controversy has been pumped through the
   news cycle, it has gone from the relatively low key procedural question
   of when to introduce new evidence in confirmation hearings, to all
   sorts of virtuous stands about sexual harassment and assault, to the
   true meaning of due process and the nature of proof and truth. None of
   that has been enough. As of this morning, we are fighting a key battle
   in an ancient civil war between women and men. The battle lines have
   been drawn. Where you stand on this matter puts you irrevocably on one
   side or the other. You must stand somewhere. If not, we’ll assign you a
   side.

   One week ago, it was the federal response to a hurricane. Two weeks
   ago, it was a shoe company’s advertisement, featuring a former
   professional football quarterback. Before that, maybe a tweet by the
   president? Something about body shaming a celebrity? A school shooting,
   or the false statistics about school shootings? The #MeToo revelations?
   Election tampering? Restrooms for transgender people? A local or state
   primary? A police shooting? Poor water quality somewhere? Some private
   business not serving someone for some reason? A protest march for some
   cause or another? A counter protest? A presidential election?

   By the time this comes to print, we will have moved on to something
   else. Whatever that is will be so important that we must all line up in
   our digital armies, increasingly backed by the implied or even literal
   threat that someday soon those armies will be virtual no longer.

   The specific issue doesn’t matter, really—not when we treat all issues
   as if they were battles in wars raging across our galaxy.

   Although all this drama long precedes the current president, there is a
   nice serendipity to our current mania. Never has there been a more
   perfect and timely pun than trumped up, at least when it comes to all
   those average Joes, late for work.

   In our mad rush to infuse everything with galactic meaning, to create
   some epic big picture, we pervert or deny all of the little true
   pictures of everyday life. The problem is not so much that these
   galactic problems rarely actually touch our local or individual
   day-to-day lives, although they rarely do. The problem is that the
   lines we draw in these galactic disputes box us into positions that
   have nothing to do with how we live those day-to-day lives.

   It doesn’t matter what the topic is. All Americans come into contact
   with people of different races, ethnicities, religions, sexual
   orientations, shapes and sizes. Most Americans have had some close
   experience with issues of sexual assault, drug use or violent crime.
   Most Americans either are or know people who are politically active or
   even political activists. And, no matter what happens on television or
   on social media, almost all of those Americans deal with those
   experiences on a case-by-case basis. The rigid lines that supposedly
   divide us—men/women, Democrat/Republican, black/white, straight/gay,
   Christian/Muslim, etc.—are of course there, but they rarely apply to
   the millions of everyday situations at hand.

   None of this is to say that the big controversies do not matter. They
   do matter, some more than others, and some for many more than others.
   After all, eventually Darth Vader and the Empire did use the Death Star
   to destroy a planet, killing everyone who inhabited it. That causal
   chain compels us—it links bad guys scheming to gain or consolidate
   power to those same bad guys using that power for unspeakable evil and
   murdering or oppressing the millions who oppose them. The twentieth
   century produced at least three very real Darth Vaders in Hitler,
   Stalin and Mao, and the damage they wrought has us on the constant look
   out for their like.

   But, for all of our supposedly brewing civil wars, for all the budding
   Hitlers and Stalins out there, as people we remain awfully civil with
   each other in real life. While this galactic war between the light and
   the dark side rages out in space, millions and millions of average Joes
   go about their everyday lives. And it is not just that the star wars
   don’t matter, it is that their supposed meaning runs contrary to most
   of our experiences. Every day, supposed enemies, supposed Jedis and
   Sith, go to work, school and church, play sports, eat barbeques, and go
   out to dinner. Together. If we are aware that we are supposed to be
   enemies, we figure out ways to get along anyway. When we do fall out
   with others, it is almost always for specific personal reasons, not as
   some manifestation of a political or social division.

   Ever since the election of Donald Trump, commentators from all over the
   spectrum have tried to explain the political landscape using the idea
   of a resurgence of populism. They have not been very successful,
   because the phenomenon they are trying to describe spans the political
   spectrum, and never approaches anything like a unified, big-P
   Populism. If the Tea Parties and the pussyhat-wearing women’s marchers
   can both be described as populist, the word does not really have much
   meaning.

   There is something else going on. What we have tried to call populism
   is better described more simply as anger. This anger is a reaction to
   our Star Wars politics, and despite all the pain and angst, that anger
   is a good sign.

   No one planned for us to get to this point, but we were bound to get
   into trouble. The twenty-four hour news cycle, the expansion of the
   internet, and widespread participation in social media have given more
   people direct access to national and nationwide politics than at any
   time in history. That open access has made it difficult to distinguish
   between the two, and we have fallen in the habit of treating everything
   that happens anywhere in the nation in terms of national politics. Bad
   water in Michigan? Blame Obama or Trump. School shooting in Florida?
   The Republicans let them have guns or the Democrats wouldn’t let them
   defend themselves. Sexual assault in California? Typical promiscuous
   liberals or typical manifestation of the oppressive patriarchy.

   It happens all the time. Catholics are made to feel they are supporting
   a regime of child abuse, even though they know that is not why they
   adhere to the faith. The citizens of cities like Charlottesville are
   told they are all actively racist, just as the people of Chicago or
   Detroit are made to believe they are part of a criminal regime. All of
   Hollywood is made up of sex offenders. All Democrats are closet
   communists. All Republicans are women-hating fascists. All university
   classrooms are hotbeds of radicalism. All men are rapists. All women
   are victims of rape. And so on, depending on the issue of the day.

   This is tyranny of the most fundamental sort, in that it suppresses
   individual free thought. By drawing lines and assigning ourselves
   positions on either side of those lines—left or right, Democrat or
   Republican, man or woman, black or white—these politics represent a
   fundamental assault on liberty.

   That is why the anger is a good sign, because it is not really aimed at
   one group or another, but rather at the idea that what we believe and
   how we live our everyday lives can be defined by anyone other than
   ourselves. We remain fiercely independent.

   These Star Wars politics, this diminishment of the average Joe, late
   for work, this assault on individual liberty, cannot stand. It is up to
   us to figure out what comes next.

   In the wake of World Mental Health Day and Theresa May’s appointment of
   a suicide prevention minister, this might seem like the least
   propitious time to make a case against mental health awareness, even if
   both of the events mentioned have been criticized as tokenistic rather
   than consequential. Evidently, awareness raising about mental health
   has never been more widespread, yet it is still often argued there is a
   taboo against talking about mental illness.

   Newspaper columns often showcase frenzied discussions of everything
   from the student suicide epidemic to the worrying rise in
   antidepressant use, whilst personal stories of mental illness are
   shared more often and more openly by the day. Social media provides
   other ways of raising awareness, from hashtags to viral campaigns. For
   example, here is a detailed summary of the ways in which memes are used
   to promote mental health awareness. But this catch-all phrase awareness
   has been coming under increasing scrutiny. Some commentators argue that
   we have an over-prescription problem, symptomatic of a moral panic
   fuelled by too many doctors pandering to patient fears, too much
   self-diagnosis and too little effective research into the utility of
   antidepressant use. We must continue to ask ourselves if raising
   awareness is still proactive or meaningful. The push for awareness can
   be a counterproductive way of approaching the mental health crisis.

   Those who focus on awareness often approach the problem by presenting
   inflated statistics. Although student suicide rates have been parsed as
   an epidemic, the statistical risk has remained steady in proportion to
   total student population and is actually lower than that of the general
   population. But perhaps it’s only the problem of suicide that is being
   sensationalized—while there has been a very real increase in other
   related mental health problems? The issue, however, is what we choose
   to call problems. Many issues have become medicalized, no matter how
   far the symptoms are from meeting the threshold for diagnosis. This
   facilitates incorrect self-diagnoses. Awareness raising can encourage
   hypersensitivity and panic, bringing an increasing number of
   experiences, which are part and parcel of the stress of tackling
   quotidian obstacles, under the widening umbrella of mental illness. At
   universities, this has led to infantilizing remedies, often tied to
   safe space culture. Victimhood abounds, interpersonal upset is
   rebranded in the language of microaggressions and trigger warnings, and
   everyone must be wary of what they say in case those listening are
   especially sensitive to the sound. This has inspired ten-step guides
   and stilted infomercials dictating unnatural social behaviors, which we
   are encouraged to adopt before we can even have a normal chat with
   someone experiencing mental health problems.

   This pathologizing of and protection from discomfort is nowhere more
   prevalent than at universities, as Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff
   have recently highlighted. Worryingly, UK higher education minister Sam
   Gyimah has recently called for academics to make the wellbeing of their
   students their top priority, above their duty to educate. Amidst a
   looming student mental health crisis, he argues that universities must
   provide emotional support for students during their academic studies,
   in order to “fulfill their purpose.” The number of first year students
   seeking mental health support has reportedly grown fivefold in the past
   decade, whilst the rate of dropouts due to mental health problems has
   trebled. The BBC this week reported that over the past five years there
   has been a 50% increase in students seeking mental health support.
   Sadly, the panaceas of pet therapy and self-care classes seem
   insufficient to ease the strain that has been placed on student mental
   health services. When universities must be seen to be doing everything
   to tackle the purported epidemic, it is no surprise that they come up
   with nannying responses, such as closing libraries late at night to
   encourage better sleeping habits. I have no issue with people just
   trying to reduce stress, but to frame these as solutions—as responsible
   ways for universities to tackle the mental health problems of their
   students—is ridiculous.

   Criticism of all too simplistic awareness raising, and the
   medicalization of everyday problems it encourages, is nothing new. Vice
   has questioned this trope, through articles such as “Stop Confusing
   Your Nerves With Having Anxiety.” Areo has featured a report from a
   clinician who treats young people incapable of escaping a
   self-constructed narrative about the intractable depths of their mental
   ill health. Spectator Life has addressed rising anti-anxiety
   prescriptions for children, suggesting that mental health education has
   enfeebled kids who are now too aware to benefit from an ignorance is
   bliss mentality. A recent Guardian article argues that “people claiming
   they have serious conditions when they don’t just exacerbates negative
   stereotypes,” even though another article in the same paper rightly
   points out that “genuine awareness raising—thoughtful, responsible
   testimonies from people living with mental illness or disability—is
   invaluable.” I categorize these sorts of testimonies as mental health
   openness.

   The Case for Mental Health Openness

   Calm and open discussions of a person’s experiences—anecdotes about
   seeing their GPs, discussions of SSRI dosages or details about
   treatment plans—are the easiest way to normalize mental health problems
   and make people aware of what others are going through. This process
   might even help the sort of people who are trapped in a climate of
   intense navel-gazing individualism—those who overthink and
   catastrophize their problems and internalize a narrative of being
   trapped by their mental illness—become aware that their issues are
   manageable, not medical.

   Isabel Hardman has penned masterful, thoughtful, touching testimonies
   in the Spectator which have been a comfort to me during my own rougher
   spells. Dealing with topics such as grief, anorexia and anxiety, honest
   personal stories, written by those who have overcome or are undergoing
   a darker period in their lives, can be heartening and helpful.
   Tellingly, there seems to be no real gender disparity in the authors of
   these articles: even traditionally stoic males are opening up. The idea
   that we still need to raise awareness about mental health is belied by
   the fact that many of those telling their stories are stereotyped as
   the very people who are most at risk of bottling things up.

   I may not be personally aware of the extent of the taboo around
   discussion of mental health, since I am a student, socializing in
   circles in which sympathy for sufferers abounds. Most of my peers are
   socially aware and emotionally intelligent. However, the perception
   that it’s hard to talk about mental health doesn’t hold as much water
   as it once did. There is a marked difference between a subject being
   taboo and just being difficult to talk about. The topic of mental
   health isn’t ring-fenced. But the opportunities to talk about it are
   few, and our ability to do so is plagued by embarrassment and
   timidity—something no amount of awareness could ever remedy.

   You should receive support from friends and family whether you are
   going through a tough time or are genuinely mentally unwell. Yet many
   people feel they will receive more emotional support if they have been
   properly diagnosed, are undergoing counseling, seeking therapy or
   taking SSRIs. When an unhappy person undertakes a period of soul
   searching, they are unlikely to emerge from it concluding that they are
   simply suffering through life’s normal ups and downs.

   Whilst medication may well be unnecessary for some—there is evidence to
   suggest that SSRIs are being overprescribed and that their side effects
   may be no better than the symptoms they are designed to remedy—we
   should show no less compassion towards those who are experiencing
   comparable symptoms, but who would benefit from other forms of
   treatment. The tranquilizing relief medication brings can often stop
   sufferers from tackling the underlying issues.

   Commentators often equate mental health problems with physical ailments
   (insisting rightly that we should be no less embarrassed to talk about
   mental than about physical disease). The flip side of this, however, is
   that only when the afflicted person is treating her mental ailments
   like physical problems, i.e. with pills, are we willing to validate her
   suffering. This might create a perverse pressure to prove that you
   really are mentally unwell rather than just stressed out. Falling back
   on the sure-fire proof that you must be truly ill because you’re on
   medication is understandable. But perhaps we should look for other ways
   to distinguish those really struggling to cope from those who are
   having a tough but manageable time of it? We have created a new sort of
   stigma in reverse—the stigma of not being mentally ill enough—albeit a
   stigma that might well be restricted to millennials and generation Z,
   who are considered at higher risk of mental health issues.

   Treating mental health as a physical problem is an unintended
   by-product of the awareness raising designed to normalize the problem
   and convey both the seriousness and the treatability of the symptoms. A
   friend of mine who has long suffered from the truly stigmatized problem
   of alcoholism— of which the mental symptoms are a precursor and an
   accompaniment to the physical ones—knows this first hand. After months
   of unsuccessfully trying to get help with his addiction, which was
   causing him acute mental suffering, he was sent straight to the front
   of the queue for treatment only when his face became visibly jaundiced,
   i.e. when the physical symptoms became too extreme to ignore. Treat it
   like a physical ailment works well in theory, but less so in practice:
   mental ill health is simply nothing like having a broken leg.  In my
   experience, it is not until you become a physical threat to yourself
   that clinicians start to take notice. This might reflect the strain on
   mental health services—they have to prioritize somehow and this is a
   crude and effective form of triage. But it will take a huge cultural
   shift before we worry about the mental as much as we do the physical.

   Before suggesting counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy to counter
   stress and anxiety, doctors often fall back on the treat it like you
   would a physical problem mantra and recommend medication. Innumerable
   self-help tips are also available for those who are struggling.
   Self-help literature—ranging from memoirs by Google employees on how to
   hijack your productivity to advice from Navy Seals on how to turn
   struggle into progress—is a huge industry. And, though proven to be
   ineffective, it is worth $10 billion per year. There are more and more
   anti-anxiety products marketed at the general public by the day: stress
   balls have been superseded by fidget spinners, adult coloring books and
   weighted blankets. Imagine how someone who feels that they are mentally
   unwell might be affected by this, caught in the growing trends of
   self-improvement, and using commercialized anti-anxiety products. How
   does someone who feels that he is genuinely mentally ill, but who is
   not taking SSRIs, reconcile himself to the fact that the methods he is
   using to treat his illness are not dissimilar from those a healthy
   individual might by seeking from the teachings in The Power of Now?

   We need to be careful how we frame problems of stress and keep a sense
   of proportion, acknowledging the range of possible experiences and not
   trivializing real suffering in our noble attempts to improve everyone’s
   lot. As Ken McLaughlin has argued, “We first need to take on the
   cultural zeitgeist that cultivates psychological vulnerability and
   seeks to medicalize all the material and existential problems of human
   existence.”

   Between Callousness and Condescension

   Critics argue that over-prescription of SSRIs is extremely detrimental.
   Instead of encouraging psychic resilience and explaining that feeling
   stress is normal sometimes, we are creating a crisis by being too
   afraid to tell those in need of a dose of stoicism precisely what they
   need to hear. Some have argued that this is traceable to the rise of
   the over-sensitive snowflake generations (millenials and generation Z),
   who venerate identity and would never risk offending anyone on the
   basis of their self-perceived identity, even if doing so would be
   beneficial because it would prompt much needed self-reflection.
   Dispelling deeply held personal narratives about the fragility of
   someone’s mental state is a thankless task, even if it is the best way
   to help them in the longer term.

   One of the most outspoken advocates of human resilience is Brendan
   O’Neill. In “You Are Not Mentally Ill,” he argues:

   We shouldn’t ditch the stiff upper lip; we should rehabilitate it, and
   encourage the young in particular to exercise it. Having a stiff upper
   lip doesn’t mean being an arrogant muppet who thinks nothing in life
   ever touches him—it simply means believing that you have the moral and
   mental wherewithal to cope with things, even when they get difficult.

   As ever, there is a grain of truth in O’Neill’s contrarianism. My
   personal position is analogous to that of Christopher Hitchens on
   climate change. Even if the climate change denialists are right, the
   fact that our existence is tied to this one planet should force us to
   exercise caution and not risk irreparably damaging it. Similarly, we
   each have only one mind and one body—shouldn’t we err on the side of
   caution? It seems both unsympathetic and irresponsible to simply urge
   someone to exercise a bit more self-discipline if they are feeling
   gloomy or stressed. As Iona Italia points out, an unprecedented number
   of students really are struggling with mental illness. We should do
   everything we can to help those in pain—without necessarily
   categorizing their problems as fully-fledged mental health issues, but
   also without being so callous that all we do is recommend a dose of
   stoicism.

   Another, much subtler and more ubiquitous, misguided response to those
   with mental health problems is that of conflating depression with low
   self-esteem. J. K. Rowling’s tweet to Andrew Tate, a man accused of
   claiming that depression is merely a failure of will, strayed close to
   this in my opinion. Rowling told Tate, “Some of the most gifted,
   successful and gorgeous people I know suffer/have suffered with
   depression. You are not alone. Have a hug.” This might have been
   sincere, but ultimately it sounds both patronizing and hollow.
   Depression is much more complex than this. I found Tate’s tweets,
   insensitive as they are, more motivating than J. K. Rowling’s. At
   least, Tate’s tweets—like a cruder and more callous version of Jordan
   Peterson’s 12 Rules For Life—encourage taking responsibility for
   yourself.

   Perhaps others may find Rowling’s sentiments more comforting than I do:
   there is more than one way of being obtuse when it comes to helping
   those with mental health issues. Between what we should recognize as
   these two extremes—between life-hacking tips that masquerade as
   encouragement on the one hand, and condescending compliments and fake
   deference on the other—there are approaches that can help. Jungian
   analyst Lisa Marchiano provides an apt summary of this middle ground.
   Marchiano argues that we should help sufferers “understand themselves
   as resilient, rather than infirm and frail. We ought to help people
   imagine larger, richer, more complex stories for themselves, rather
   than simplistic narratives of illness and victimhood.” Though Marchiano
   addresses this advice to people with minor, non-medical anxiety issues,
   helping people imagine a richer future for themselves, and helping them
   take steps towards that future, is an approach applicable to mental
   health problems in general.

   Some argue that awareness raising simply helps us to tackle anxiety and
   depression—but it can stray into romanticization of mental illness. It
   is true that more serious and uncommon mental health issues are still
   poorly understood and negatively stereotyped. Encouraging everyone to
   be open about the real nature of their problems and the effects they
   have on them— whether these effects are serious, diagnosable,
   treatable, commonplace, well or poorly understood—should be imperative
   for everyone seriously interested in tackling the mental health crisis.

   We should be similarly open minded in our responses. There is often a
   stigma attached to telling someone that their problems (whilst
   deserving of empathy and concern) don’t constitute an illness. But it
   benefits everyone when we can speak openly about these topics, without
   self-conscious hedging or timidity about how we are likely to be
   perceived. When someone talks openly about his mental health problems,
   we should offer understanding, respectful, engaged listening—but not
   mollycoddle or patronize. Sufferers are not merely part of an alarming
   statistic. We should be wary of confirming faulty narratives or
   parroting empty platitudes drawn from unserious wellbeing campaigns.

       I think there’s a bit of a tension in this piece. One the one hand,
       we hear the traditionalist approaches to “mental health”: stoicism,
       self-sacrifice, rejection of victimhood culture, seeking to better
       oneself as an individual, so as to avoid burdening others etc,
       critique of self-indulgent “therapy culture”. On the other, we’re
       encouraged to “have an honest conversation” about mental-health
       issues. If we do want to take inspiration from older ideas of
       dignity, propriety, amour-propre, self-respect, and personal
       toughness, might we be better off just not talking about our
       feelings in the first place?

       Although I agree with the general statements this article is saying
       (e.g. over medicalization, infantilization of young adults, etc.)
       it also seems to say that mental illness – particularly mood
       disorders – as metaphysical problem that can be solved with
       improving one’s character. For the most part, I would agree that
       most people who think that they are depressed, or are suffering
       from episodic depressive symptoms, this sort of framing of the
       mental health episode would probably be useful. Take the boxer
       Tyson Fury, for example. He never suffered from depression until
       after he won the heavyweight title. It was the loss of goal
       oriented behaviour along with other character traits that led him
       to depression and substance abuse. Once we was focused on new goals
       his depression waned. Despite all of his head trauma I would still
       classify this as a stereotypical case of episodic depression that
       can be solved largely through cognitive and behaviour
       interventions. Unfortunately, depression isn’t one thing.
       Depression describes symptoms, not the cause, so these cases can
       often be lumped together which allows some people (perhaps even the
       writer of this article) to falsely assume that all mood disorders
       are disorders of character, and not in any way organic in origin.
       Chronic depression starting from childhood, with no recorded
       traumatic events, is a good example of a real physical disorder
       that underlies depression and requires a level of medicalization in
       order to determine some medical interventions that may help to
       mitigate the symptoms. Perhaps it is this writer’s reliance on
       psychologists of the psychoanalytical approach that leads him to
       this understanding of mood disorders and mental health.
       Psychoanalysts tend to put too much emphasis on cumbersome
       mythologies of mental health aetiologies. In any case, my hope is
       that our culture drops “mental health awareness” campaigns (and any
       other “awareness” campaign of something most people are aware of)
       in favour of real constructive dialogue using proper terminology.
       That way, we are more able to determine the difference between
       normal, episodic emotional episodes that can be treated primarily
       through behaviour modification, and that of real physical mental
       illnesses that require a more nuanced and dynamic approach to
       treating.

            Hi, I am the author of this article and quite agree with a lot
            of the points you raise. I wish I had made the distinction
            clearer that I think some of what is incorrectly termed a
            mental health problem is actually just a metaphysical problem
            that is best served by trying to improve one’s character. I
            say this as i think, as you point out, there is a marked
            difference between these problems and depression of ‘organic
            origin’ which takes a lot more to tackle than appeals to
            character improvement and addressing material problems. I wish
            I has made this more clear as I am undergoing psychoanalytic
            therapy myself for this category of a non-trivial mental
            health problem, and believe medical interventions should be
            used when neccessary, but should also be used carefully having
            taken the symptoms seriously rather than assuming all matters
            of existential disillusionment are a call to medical or
            therapeutic intervention. At the very least, it strains
            resources for those who need it. As such, I wish I had made it
            clearer that my understanding of mood disorders was meant to
            frame some problems – that might even cause equal distress –
            as having much clearer underlying causes and thus tangible
            remedies. In any case, thanks for your thoughtful comment.

       My concern is that many mental health problems are unhealthy
       responses to real problems in life. For example, many people that I
       have known who were depressed have been through bad times and have
       a lot to be depressed about (e.g., divorce, lost jobs). Focusing on
       the depression rather than coping with the actual problems does not
       seem productive. Anxiety due to too much focus on politics likewise
       can be made worse by focusing on it instead of finding other
       activities such as sports to occupy oneself.
       I remember reading about some students who were so upset about
       Trump’s election and so wrapped up in protesting that they could
       not do their studies–they were unwell and suffering totally from
       choices they made about how to respond to a presidential election.
       Not a medical problem. More of a group hysteria.
       If you are anxious about school, you can focus on the anxiety or do
       proactive things (get a tutor, re-evaluate your choice of major,
       look into your study skills).
       If someone is “unhappy” this can be a philosophical problem, not a
       medical one. What does it mean to be “happy”? Perhaps the problem
       is too many movies where people live happily ever after–ie
       unrealistic expectations.
       It is possible to look inside for your approval rather than seeking
       it from others–to be self-reliant. This can be quite satisfying and
       stable.
       I am not of course ignoring real mental illness (OCD, Tourettes,
       schizophrenia). But a lot of what people are talking about (anxiety
       about politics, sadness, mild depression) are related to
       life-coping skills.

   Every society has certain socially prescribed rules that regulate
   mating and marriage, yet those rules can vary substantially.
   Understanding how cultural traditions differ can help us understand
   behavioral differences between societies. Polygyny—one male married to
   more than one female—is a practice with large differences across
   cultures: in some societies, nearly all marriages are polygynous ones,
   while in others the practice is banned entirely. One question that has
   plagued anthropologists for decades is: how much can the practice of
   polygyny be explained by female choice and how much can be attributed
   to male coercion and male dominated social traditions?

   In a recent article for this magazine, Jerry Barnett argues that,

   Although traditional polygamy is often presented as the exercise of
   male power, this is inaccurate. Polygamy results from female choice. In
   pre-civilized societies, unrestrained by social pressure to leave
   attached men alone, women would select the best available mate, whether
   or not he already had other mates. This resulted in the imbalances
   mentioned earlier, and in the creation of a rigid class system that
   divided men into a minority of breeders and a majority of losers. This
   system broadly serves the needs of women, and of the winning male
   minority. It also serves the wider community, by selecting the best
   male genes in each generation, and so accelerating human evolution.

   As we can see, Barnett appears to consider polygyny to be entirely the
   result of female choice. Is that the case?

   Attributing definitive, single causes to complex human behaviors is
   always a fraught endeavor. Nonetheless, by examining the types of
   social traditions that societies with high rates of polygyny tend to
   have, we can consider whether the weight of evidence supports this
   female choice explanation.

   In his 2003 paper, “The Mating System of Foragers in the Standard
   Cross-Cultural Sample,” anthropologist Frank Marlowe found that there
   are more polygynously married women in hunter-gatherer societies where
   female marriage is arranged. This pattern also holds for societies with
   other subsistence systems. Marlowe writes:

   Among all 186 societies in the SCCS [Standard Cross-Cultural Sample],
   there is greater polygyny where female marriages are arranged but not
   where male marriages are arranged, suggesting that marriage arrangement
   is a form of male coercion and a way parents can benefit by supplying
   the most influential males with brides.

   Similarly, anthropologist John Hartung found that, across the hundreds
   of societies coded in the Ethnographic Atlas, greater polygyny is
   associated with the practice of bride price (in which a potential groom
   or his family provides goods or wealth to the potential wife’s family)
   and a greater male bias in terms of inheritance of goods and property.
   These practices also tend to mean a younger age at first marriage for
   girls, who are often betrothed while still children—usually to much
   older men. This is a consequence of the bride price, which leads to
   young daughters being married off in exchange for wealth or goods such
   as livestock, so wives can eventually be purchased for the sons.
   Anthropologist Lucy Mair writes that among pastoralist societies with
   high rates of polygyny,

   Where cattle payments are made, the marriage of girls tends to be early
   for the same reason that that of men is late—that a girl’s marriage
   increases her father’s herd while that of a young man diminishes it. Of
   the Luhya, Wagner notes that the impatience of sons to marry and the
   reluctance of daughters to lose their freedom are both causes of family
   dissension.

   Broadly, the cross-cultural pattern described above seems to support
   the idea that polygynous marriage is often the result of wealthy and/or
   influential families trading for or purchasing wives for their sons or
   other male kin, and not due to female choice.

   For a more specific example, we can consider the marriage practices of
   the Tiwi hunter-gatherers of North Australia. The Tiwi—like many other
   aboriginal Australian societies—had a system that has sometimes been
   referred to as gerontocratic polygyny, in which most women were
   polygynously married to old men, while most young men remained single.
   The Tiwi also practiced infant bestowal and widow remarriage: young
   girls would be promised in marriage by their fathers before they were
   even born, while widows were required to remarry soon after the deaths
   of their husbands. Anthropologists Charles Hart and Arnold Piling write
   that:

   the twin mechanisms of infant bestowal and widow marriage resulted in a
   very unusual type of household, in which old successful men had twenty
   wives each, while men under thirty had no wives at all and men under
   forty were married mostly to elderly crones.

   The Tiwi social system also illustrates the important role ecology and
   subsistence patterns play in promoting or constraining polygynous
   marriages. Hart and Piling add that,

   The most concrete symbol of Tiwi success was the possession of surplus
   food, for this not only permitted its possessor to make gifts to others
   and throw large parties for which he picked up the check, but also gave
   him lots of leisure time to devote to social and political life. Since
   a man required a large number of women in his work force if he was to
   build up a surplus of food, in the final analysis it was control of
   women that was the most tangible index of power and influence. Women
   were the main currency of the influence struggle, the main “trumps” in
   the endless bridge game.

   Polygynous marriages across cultures are more common where males
   contribute less to subsistence. When most of the food is procured by
   females, males tend to spend less time with their children and more
   time devoted to pursuing mates or engaging in warfare. Where males
   contribute more on average to subsistence, it is more difficult for
   them to generate the amount of food necessary to support multiple
   wives, and this inhibits higher rates of polygyny. The relative rarity
   of polygyny among the Copper Inuit, who were almost wholly reliant on
   male hunting for subsistence, provides a good example of this pattern.
   Anthropologist Diamond Jenness writes that,

   Very few men have more than one wife each. Polygamy increases their
   responsibilities and the labour required of them; moreover it subjects
   them to a great deal of jealousy and ill-feeling, especially on the
   part of men who cannot find wives for themselves. The Eskimo
   polygamist, therefore, must be a man of great energy and skill in
   hunting, bold and unscrupulous, always ready to assert himself and to
   uphold his position by an appeal to force.

   Jenness emphasizes that, to take and keep multiple wives, a Copper man
   must be a skilled and hard-working hunter, able to manage the jealousy
   of co-wives, as well as that of rival men, and defend his wives by
   force when necessary. Jenness notes an example of a man named Norak who
   took another man’s second wife by force:

   Norak, being unable to obtain a wife elsewhere, laid hands on
   Anengnak’s second wife one day and began to drag her away. Anengnak
   caught hold of her on the other side, and a tug of war ensued, but
   finally Norak, though the smaller of the two, succeeded in dragging her
   away to his hut and made her his wife.

   One relatively common pattern is for secondary wives to be valued for
   their labor. Jenness notes that one man told him that he took his
   second wife to help with dressing and packing the meat he brought back
   to camp. Consider another example of polygyny among the Arapesh
   horticulturalists of New Guinea. Anthropologist Donald Tuzin tells the
   story of a woman who was in polygynous marriages twice:

   Akwaliwa recalled that her first marriage had been to Kunai, who was
   now charitably, but discreetly (so as not to arouse gossip), helping to
   support her in widowhood. Because Falipa’w (Kunai’s senior wife) and
   one or two of the other cowives did not like her, the original union
   soon dissolved, and Akwaliwa took up with Asao as his second wife. Not
   long afterward, the first wife died. The two lived monogamously for
   three or four years before Asao casually asked what she would think of
   his taking another wife. Akwaliwa, angry and jealous at the question
   and still bruised by the troubles she had had as a cowife, refused to
   hear of it. Asao quickly dropped the subject. Afterward, however,
   touched that Asao so clearly respected her feelings, Akwaliwa inwardly
   relented. Accordingly, when Asao next raised the question—saying gently
   that she would have someone to help her in the gardens and grooves,
   someone to keep her company during his frequent prolonged
   absences—Akwaliwa gave her consent. A second wife joined the household
   soon afterward. After some initial difficulty, which Asao skillfully
   resolved, the two women got along very well together, and in due course
   a third was smoothly added to the household. “We all lived very happily
   together,” said Akwaliwa.

   This illustrates some of the complexities of polygynous marriage:
   female labor as a motivating factor, jealousy and conflict between
   co-wives, and even the initial preference for monogamous marriage,
   although this does seem to be an example of a successful and largely
   voluntary polygynous marriage. It’s important to keep in mind, though,
   that the Arapesh also practiced bride price, arranged marriages by kin,
   and had a ‘men’s cult,’ which dominated society and exerted strong
   control over the women, so we should not assume these outcomes were
   entirely due to choice.

   Conflict between co-wives is relatively common across polygynous
   societies. As a consequence, co-wives do not always reside in the same
   household, and instead each mother and her children may require their
   own home. In his 1949 work Social Structure, anthropologist George
   Murdock writes:

   The polygynous family creates problems of personal adjustments which do
   not arise under monogamy, notably disputes arising from sexual jealousy
   and over the distribution of economic tasks in the feminine sphere of
   activity. A number of cultural solutions are apparent in the data. We
   have already noted the frequency with which co-wives are assigned to
   separate dwellings. Another common solution is to give one wife,
   usually the one first married, a superior social status and to delegate
   to her a general supervisory authority over the feminine tasks of the
   household.

   A relatively common—though not universal—pattern found in societies
   with polygyny is that monogamously married women and first wives tend
   to have better outcomes for themselves and their children than second
   and third wives. Anthropologist Caroline Uggla and her colleagues found
   that among the Arsi Oromo agropastoralists of Ethiopia, “Results show
   that there are no significant differences in child survival between
   monogamous women and first wives, but second order wives or higher have
   23–24% lower odds of survival for sons and daughters than monogamous
   women.” Anthropologist Beverly Strassmann found higher rates of child
   mortality among even first wives compared to monogamously married women
   among the Dogon pastoralists of Mali.

   At the same time, co-wives are also sometimes considered a source of
   support. Among the Himba pastoralists of Nimibia, a majority of women
   surveyed supported polygyny. Anthropologist Brooke Scelza notes that,
   “Himba women listed a variety of benefits to having co-wives, including
   help with domestic tasks, including caring for livestock (mainly
   milking cows, which is made much easier with at least two people),
   working in the garden, caring for children, making repairs to the
   compound, and fetching wood and water.” However, about half of the
   Himba women surveyed said sexual jealousy was a problem, and 44% listed
   conflict over resources as a problem. In addition, first marriages are
   often arranged for young Himba girls through bride price, and the Himba
   live patrilocally (in the husband’s natal village), so the main role of
   female choice in such scenarios is not necessarily in the choice of
   partner, but in the freedom to divorce and return to their own natal
   homes if the marriage doesn’t work out. Scelza writes that,

   Overall, social factors such as the ability to divorce and return to
   one’s natal home between marriages mean that Himba women have a large
   degree of choice in relation to polygyny, with those who are in
   positive relationships often choosing to stay and those who are unhappy
   able to leave. This likely accounts for the generally positive
   perception of the practice among Himba women.

   Much of the Himba data indicates that having assistance with domestic
   tasks is a significant driver of perceptions of polygyny. Women who
   have elder daughters, or other adult female kin in their household,
   tend to have more negative views of polygyny, while those without that
   degree of social support and assistance in tasks tend to have a more
   positive view of the practice.

   In his 2017 book The Psychology of Marriage, psychologist Glenn
   Weisfeld and his colleagues note that, “Pair bonding is an evolved
   tendency [in humans] with genetic, hormonal, and societal supports, and
   defense of the pair bond through jealousy and mate guarding.” And
   further that, “Traits that enhance mate value, success in remaining
   married, and success in raising children have been selected for,” in
   humans. As I previously discussed in an article on monogamy for
   Quillette, my impression from the ethnographic record is that most
   people (male or female) in most, if not all, societies generally prefer
   not to have to share their partner. When there are lower rates of
   polygyny in societies in which people have greater freedom to choose
   their partners, female choice probably does play some role in the
   polygynous unions we see. Further, female choice is exercised through
   divorce or through attempting to prevent a husband from adding another
   wife. However, where you see the extreme rates of polygyny, such as
   among the Tiwi, this usually seems to be the result of social
   institutions that promote arranged marriages, in which wealthier,
   older, higher status males receive multiple young wives in exchange for
   goods or wealth.

   It is the practice of widespread polygyny, not monogamy, that tends to
   require more coercive social norms and institutions to maintain it. For
   most people in most societies, monogamy is usually the most widespread,
   and even preferred, form of marriage. Certain ecological circumstances
   may help promote or inhibit the practice of polygyny, but strongly
   male-biased cultural traditions are usually required to maintain it at
   high rates. In contemporary Western societies, where there is often a
   strong ethos of individual freedom, and where kin tend to have
   relatively limited involvement in marriage decisions, it is perhaps
   unsurprising that monogamy is the most widespread form of marriage and
   polygyny remains quite rare.

       “In contemporary Western societies, where there is often a strong
       ethos of individual freedom” there is less male coercion hence
       monogamy is the norm. Strange, I thought we lived in a patriarchy.

       As the author of the original piece, I’d like to thank William for
       this excellent article. I do realise there are many forms of
       polygyny, with many variants of female and male power. My paragraph
       quoted is taken in isolation, and is perhaps a little loose, but
       was set in the context of explaining the roots of polygyny in
       ancient sexual commerce. The key sentence “Polygamy results from
       female choice” would have been more clearly written as “Polygyny
       originated in female choice”. This isn’t at all an attempt to deny
       that many diverse system of polygyny have subsequently evolved,
       often driven (as this article states) by modes of food production.
       So, as male involvement in food production rises (in pastoralism,
       or following the invention of the plough), power shifts to men, and
       marriages structures evolve as a result. I’ve seen varying forms of
       modern polygyny; in tropical West Africa, where female choice often
       still reigns (and women often still tend gardens by hand), and
       marriage/sex openly go to the highest bidder (or at least to the
       man with the newest moped), and in North Africa, which tends to be
       more deeply patriarchal, and women have little say in their
       marriage partners.

       Monogamy was an idea thought up by men to reduce violence and
       societal decay caused by competition for women. Under this system,
       everyone was equal. No matter how spectacular or lowly you were,
       you got exactly one woman. Societal stability followed, and
       monogamous societies went forth and conquered the world.
       However this isn’t in women’s interest. A woman wants the best
       possible genes for her offspring, and being forced into marriage
       with incels guaranteed inferior children. This has had a
       tremendously negative effect on us, with the profusion of utter
       idiots that vote for idiot candidates. A woman’s interest is to
       bear offspring with the best males available, regardless of
       patriarchal norms of monogamy.
       The real win condition for women is to mate with the best man, and
       ensure his monogamy. Thus she will not have to share his resources
       with other women’s offspring.

            Women also win if their society does well. Not to mention that
            women in monogamous societies experience relatively less
            sexual violence, and also less unwanted pregnancies, which can
            severely undermine evolutionary fitness (think about the
            consequences of single motherhood on the fitness of a mother
            and her children).

                 DNA is selfish and cares nothing but to reproduce itself
                 with the best possible circumstances. It cares nothing
                 for societies.
                 Go ahead, try to convince a woman, any woman, that she
                 needs to marry an incel to ensure her society does well.
                 We’ll wait.
                 Insulting single mothers is a low blow. Didn’t Murphy
                 Brown rip Dan Quayle a new one for doing exactly the same
                 thing?

            Sounds like speculation.

                 Of course it is, but speculation based on evidence, like
                 any science based on analysis of existing evidence rather
                 than experimentation.

                      Yossarian’s comment is not backed by evidence, yet.
                      In which monogamous society were men equal? If
                      in-group violence is replaced by loyalty and
                      service, it’s still competition.
                      The best possible genes would be the best option for
                      a woman but it doesn’t work like that. Parents try
                      to pass over their wealth, social status and
                      reputation therefore the most successful men are not
                      necessarily the genetically optimal ones.
                      “Monogamous societies went forth and conquered the
                      world.” China was a superpower during the most of
                      the last 2000 years and still is, without a strict
                      monogamous system. Islam conquered a considerable
                      part. I think the legal distribution of sex is
                      important but not the only one factor, if you
                      consider invasion as a criteria of success.
                      “marriage with incels guaranteed inferior children”
                      This statement is absurd.
                      Critical tone about modern idiocracy is valid; it’s
                      just off topic and beyond historical comparison.
                      (If you are incel you have no offspring. If you are
                      sexually active your child might be “inferior” but
                      could not be an incel’s child, catch 22.)

                           Everyone is free to make arguments based on
                           their interpretation of available evidence. You
                           are doing it now. Good. A much better argument
                           than saying “that’s just speculation”.
                           The problem isn’t that something is
                           speculation, it is when it doesn’t take into
                           account, or is contrary to, some of the
                           evidence.

                           As for the content of the speculations, you
                           make good points, and Yossarian is wrong in his
                           assumptions.
                           Monogamy was pretty rare until the Greeks, and
                           the Greeks adopted it precisely because of
                           their distaste for the autocracies around them
                           with oligarchs getting all the women. The
                           preferred a more egalitarian, democratic
                           society, so one man, one wife.
                           The Romans adopted it, imposing it to the whole
                           Roman Empire, including the Jews (the Old
                           Testament patriarchs were polygamous). When the
                           empire crumbled, that institution remained, and
                           was later spread to other parts of the world
                           through European imperial expansion.
                           So yes, the basic idea was egalitarian, but it
                           didn’t spread because of some individual
                           “evolutionary advantage”, but for historical
                           reasons.
                           But the evidence is pretty clear that while
                           polygyny might have been a useful social system
                           for some reasons, like survival under some
                           economic circumstances, it is not generally
                           good for women’s status and rights. Women as
                           individuals do better under monogamy.
                           Re.: incels. Obviously this is just shorthand
                           for “those men who would not reproduce if there
                           was no enforced monogamy”.

                           Under a system of enforced mongamy, incels do
                           indeed get mates. Every man gets a woman,
                           that’s the whole selling point of monogamy. It
                           reduces competition for mates among men.
                           Another word for incel would be “lesser man who
                           deserves to get passed over and not carry on
                           his genes.” Women can smell this on a man a
                           mile off. Under monogamy, these lesser men
                           would indeed reproduce, and I think the
                           profusion of utter idiots today proves that
                           this is the case. How else do you explain
                           Brexit and Trump? The morons voted against
                           themselves because they got fooled by dirty
                           foreigners.

            And that is what “socially enforced monogamy” does. It gives
            all women the moral right and social support to demand
            monogamy from their husband and his exclusive support for her
            children.
            The women stuck with incels aren’t the women who could bargain
            for the best treatment for themselves or their children in a
            polygynous situation.

       Thank you for straightening out popular misconceptions about
       polygyny for a popular but well-educated audience.
       Socio-cultural anthropologists like Margaret Mead used to see it as
       their role to educate the general public about the huge variety of
       ways human societies have organized themselves, and why, but in
       recent decades no one has taken up her mantle, and people outside
       of the field today are woefully ignorant about this.
       Nice to see someone step up.
