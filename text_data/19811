Robotics Startups Are Coming to the Retail Aisle

   If an emerging wave of robotics companies have their way, it will soon
   be a common experience to walk down the aisle of a store alongside an
   autonomous robot.

   There’s OSHbot, a human-sized robot already leading customers through
   select Lowe’s stores (LOW) to the items they seek. There’s also Fetch,
   a rolling robot that can use its one arm to pluck items from a shelf
   and prep them for shipping.

   Simbe, a San Francisco startup that emerged from secrecy on Wednesday,
   is the latest to join the pack. Its new robot Tally can roll through a
   store and log what items are out of stock or incorrectly placed before
   generating a report of what actions the store should take.

   “These entities have great supply chain intelligence and point of sale
   intelligence, but there’s this clear gap in the physical store, which
   is where you and I often make our purchasing decision,” says Brad
   Bogolea, Simbe’s CEO and co-founder.

   Robots have been used by manufacturers and other industries for decades
   now to complete tedious or dangerous tasks, but it was only recently
   that robots began to move into retail work. They are no longer so
   dangerous that they need to be constrained to a cage. And thanks to
   improved sensors and computer vision, they are now smart enough to
   complete many tasks once limited to human employees.

   “A person is still a far more sophisticated, more adaptable, more
   intelligent, more skilled and more responsive part of the labor force
   than any robots we have,” says Andra Keay, the founder of Robot
   Launchpad and managing director of Silicon Valley Robotics. “But robots
   are capable of great skill and sophistication in very narrow areas.
   What interests me is we can add robot assistance at parts of the value
   chain that people don’t do well and don’t tend to like doing.”

   Simbe’s Tally robot can be programmed to take stock of a store at any
   time of day, and then return itself to its charging dock. It stops in
   front of each shelf and captures a high-resolution image of product
   labels, which are checked against a map of the ideal layout of all the
   goods in the store.

   The intelligence gathered is fed to the store’s staff, which uses the
   information to restock and reorder. A regional manager of a chain can
   get a real-time update on how goods are performing across many
   different stores. Suppliers can get immediate feedback, too.

   “Folks like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble often pay a premium for
   shelf space and want to see how their products stack up in different
   markets,” Bogolea says. “We’re very passionate about robotics and
   autonomy, but we’re also very passionate about the insight and
   behavioral change we can drive in retail with this sort of
   information.”

   Tally can capture an entire small store in about an hour, Bogolea says.
   A smaller store like Walgreens (WAG) may have human employees spend
   around 25 hours a week tracking stock with a handheld scanner. That
   number can shoot up to 200 or 300 hours in a big box store like Target
   (TGT).

   [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NN8kXh-Tpk&w=450&h=253]

   Simbe is offering Tally as a service, meaning stores essentially rent
   it for a monthly fee. Compared to the cost for human time and current
   tracking technology, Bogolea says it works out to be cheaper than using
   human employees.

   The model requires fewer upfront costs, bringing robot employees within
   reach of small stores for the first time. While Amazon (AMZN) made
   headlines last year for its autonomous robots that carry goods to box
   packers, any small business could replace a full-time employee with a
   Fetch robot instead of developing its own line of robots in-house.

   “I think that we will see robots moving around our shops in the nearer
   future, not the distant future, because a lot of the technology has
   been solved,” Keay says. “Once you prove that there is a good business
   model, the only thing slowing you down is the speed with which robots
   can be built and deployed.”

Computer AI Can Now Read Better Than You Do

   By
   Bloomberg

   Alibaba has developed an artificial intelligence model that scored
   better than humans in a Stanford University reading and comprehension
   test.

   Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) put its deep neural network model through
   its paces last week, asking the AI to provide exact answers to more
   than 100,000 questions comprising a quiz that’s considered one of the
   world’s most authoritative machine-reading gauges. The model developed
   by Alibaba’s Institute of Data Science of Technologies scored 82.44,
   edging past the 82.304 that rival humans achieved.

   Alibaba said it’s the first time a machine has out-done a real person
   in such a contest. Microsoft achieved a similar feat, scoring 82.650 on
   the same test, but those results were finalized a day after Alibaba’s,
   the company said.

   Intelligence Can Break Free and Kill Us All

   The Chinese e-commerce titan has joined the likes of Tencent Holdings
   (TCTZF) and Baidu (BIDU) in a race to develop AI that can enrich social
   media feeds, target ads and services or even aid in autonomous driving.
   Beijing has endorsed the technology in a national-level plan that calls
   for the country to become the industry leader 2030.

   So-called natural language processing mimics human comprehension of
   words and sentences. Based on more than 500 Wikipedia articles,
   Stanford’s set of questions are designed to tease out whether
   machine-learning models can process large amounts of information before
   supplying precise answers to queries.

   Be the Best in the World’

   “That means objective questions such as ‘what causes rain’ can now be
   answered with high accuracy by machines,” Luo Si, chief scientist for
   natural language processing at the Alibaba institute, said in a
   statement. “The technology underneath can be gradually applied to
   numerous applications such as customer service, museum tutorials and
   online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the
   need for human input in an unprecedented way.”

                  Computer AI Can Now Read Better Than You Do

     * Bloomberg

   January 15, 2018

   Alibaba has developed an artificial intelligence model that scored
   better than humans in a Stanford University reading and comprehension
   test.

   Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) put its deep neural network model through
   its paces last week, asking the AI to provide exact answers to more
   than 100,000 questions comprising a quiz that’s considered one of the
   world’s most authoritative machine-reading gauges. The model developed
   by Alibaba’s Institute of Data Science of Technologies scored 82.44,
   edging past the 82.304 that rival humans achieved.

   Alibaba said it’s the first time a machine has out-done a real person
   in such a contest. Microsoft achieved a similar feat, scoring 82.650 on
   the same test, but those results were finalized a day after Alibaba’s,
   the company said.

   Intelligence Can Break Free and Kill Us All

   The Chinese e-commerce titan has joined the likes of Tencent Holdings
   (TCTZF) and Baidu (BIDU) in a race to develop AI that can enrich social
   media feeds, target ads and services or even aid in autonomous driving.
   Beijing has endorsed the technology in a national-level plan that calls
   for the country to become the industry leader 2030.

   So-called natural language processing mimics human comprehension of
   words and sentences. Based on more than 500 Wikipedia articles,
   Stanford’s set of questions are designed to tease out whether
   machine-learning models can process large amounts of information before
   supplying precise answers to queries.

   Be the Best in the World’

   “That means objective questions such as ‘what causes rain’ can now be
   answered with high accuracy by machines,” Luo Si, chief scientist for
   natural language processing at the Alibaba institute, said in a
   statement. “The technology underneath can be gradually applied to
   numerous applications such as customer service, museum tutorials and
   online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the
   need for human input in an unprecedented way.”

Robotics Startups Are Coming to the Retail Aisle

   If an emerging wave of robotics companies have their way, it will soon
   be a common experience to walk down the aisle of a store alongside an
   autonomous robot.

   There’s OSHbot, a human-sized robot already leading customers through
   select Lowe’s stores (LOW) to the items they seek. There’s also Fetch,
   a rolling robot that can use its one arm to pluck items from a shelf
   and prep them for shipping.

   Simbe, a San Francisco startup that emerged from secrecy on Wednesday,
   is the latest to join the pack. Its new robot Tally can roll through a
   store and log what items are out of stock or incorrectly placed before
   generating a report of what actions the store should take.

   “These entities have great supply chain intelligence and point of sale
   intelligence, but there’s this clear gap in the physical store, which
   is where you and I often make our purchasing decision,” says Brad
   Bogolea, Simbe’s CEO and co-founder.

   Robots have been used by manufacturers and other industries for decades
   now to complete tedious or dangerous tasks, but it was only recently
   that robots began to move into retail work. They are no longer so
   dangerous that they need to be constrained to a cage. And thanks to
   improved sensors and computer vision, they are now smart enough to
   complete many tasks once limited to human employees.

   “A person is still a far more sophisticated, more adaptable, more
   intelligent, more skilled and more responsive part of the labor force
   than any robots we have,” says Andra Keay, the founder of Robot
   Launchpad and managing director of Silicon Valley Robotics. “But robots
   are capable of great skill and sophistication in very narrow areas.
   What interests me is we can add robot assistance at parts of the value
   chain that people don’t do well and don’t tend to like doing.”

   Simbe’s Tally robot can be programmed to take stock of a store at any
   time of day, and then return itself to its charging dock. It stops in
   front of each shelf and captures a high-resolution image of product
   labels, which are checked against a map of the ideal layout of all the
   goods in the store.

   The intelligence gathered is fed to the store’s staff, which uses the
   information to restock and reorder. A regional manager of a chain can
   get a real-time update on how goods are performing across many
   different stores. Suppliers can get immediate feedback, too.

   “Folks like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble often pay a premium for
   shelf space and want to see how their products stack up in different
   markets,” Bogolea says. “We’re very passionate about robotics and
   autonomy, but we’re also very passionate about the insight and
   behavioral change we can drive in retail with this sort of
   information.”

   Tally can capture an entire small store in about an hour, Bogolea says.
   A smaller store like Walgreens (WAG) may have human employees spend
   around 25 hours a week tracking stock with a handheld scanner. That
   number can shoot up to 200 or 300 hours in a big box store like Target
   (TGT).

   [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NN8kXh-Tpk&w=450&h=253]

   Simbe is offering Tally as a service, meaning stores essentially rent
   it for a monthly fee. Compared to the cost for human time and current
   tracking technology, Bogolea says it works out to be cheaper than using
   human employees.

   The model requires fewer upfront costs, bringing robot employees within
   reach of small stores for the first time. While Amazon (AMZN) made
   headlines last year for its autonomous robots that carry goods to box
   packers, any small business could replace a full-time employee with a
   Fetch robot instead of developing its own line of robots in-house.

   “I think that we will see robots moving around our shops in the nearer
   future, not the distant future, because a lot of the technology has
   been solved,” Keay says. “Once you prove that there is a good business
   model, the only thing slowing you down is the speed with which robots
   can be built and deployed.”

                Robotics Startups Are Coming to the Retail Aisle

     * Signe Brewster

   November 11, 2015

   If an emerging wave of robotics companies have their way, it will soon
   be a common experience to walk down the aisle of a store alongside an
   autonomous robot.

   There’s OSHbot, a human-sized robot already leading customers through
   select Lowe’s stores (LOW) to the items they seek. There’s also Fetch,
   a rolling robot that can use its one arm to pluck items from a shelf
   and prep them for shipping.

   Simbe, a San Francisco startup that emerged from secrecy on Wednesday,
   is the latest to join the pack. Its new robot Tally can roll through a
   store and log what items are out of stock or incorrectly placed before
   generating a report of what actions the store should take.

   “These entities have great supply chain intelligence and point of sale
   intelligence, but there’s this clear gap in the physical store, which
   is where you and I often make our purchasing decision,” says Brad
   Bogolea, Simbe’s CEO and co-founder.

   Robots have been used by manufacturers and other industries for decades
   now to complete tedious or dangerous tasks, but it was only recently
   that robots began to move into retail work. They are no longer so
   dangerous that they need to be constrained to a cage. And thanks to
   improved sensors and computer vision, they are now smart enough to
   complete many tasks once limited to human employees.

   “A person is still a far more sophisticated, more adaptable, more
   intelligent, more skilled and more responsive part of the labor force
   than any robots we have,” says Andra Keay, the founder of Robot
   Launchpad and managing director of Silicon Valley Robotics. “But robots
   are capable of great skill and sophistication in very narrow areas.
   What interests me is we can add robot assistance at parts of the value
   chain that people don’t do well and don’t tend to like doing.”

   Simbe’s Tally robot can be programmed to take stock of a store at any
   time of day, and then return itself to its charging dock. It stops in
   front of each shelf and captures a high-resolution image of product
   labels, which are checked against a map of the ideal layout of all the
   goods in the store.

   The intelligence gathered is fed to the store’s staff, which uses the
   information to restock and reorder. A regional manager of a chain can
   get a real-time update on how goods are performing across many
   different stores. Suppliers can get immediate feedback, too.

   “Folks like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble often pay a premium for
   shelf space and want to see how their products stack up in different
   markets,” Bogolea says. “We’re very passionate about robotics and
   autonomy, but we’re also very passionate about the insight and
   behavioral change we can drive in retail with this sort of
   information.”

   Tally can capture an entire small store in about an hour, Bogolea says.
   A smaller store like Walgreens (WAG) may have human employees spend
   around 25 hours a week tracking stock with a handheld scanner. That
   number can shoot up to 200 or 300 hours in a big box store like Target
   (TGT).

   Simbe is offering Tally as a service, meaning stores essentially rent
   it for a monthly fee. Compared to the cost for human time and current
   tracking technology, Bogolea says it works out to be cheaper than using
   human employees.

   The model requires fewer upfront costs, bringing robot employees within
   reach of small stores for the first time. While Amazon (AMZN) made
   headlines last year for its autonomous robots that carry goods to box
   packers, any small business could replace a full-time employee with a
   Fetch robot instead of developing its own line of robots in-house.

   “I think that we will see robots moving around our shops in the nearer
   future, not the distant future, because a lot of the technology has
   been solved,” Keay says. “Once you prove that there is a good business
   model, the only thing slowing you down is the speed with which robots
   can be built and deployed.”

                  Computer AI Can Now Read Better Than You Do

     * Bloomberg

   January 15, 2018

   Alibaba has developed an artificial intelligence model that scored
   better than humans in a Stanford University reading and comprehension
   test.

   Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) put its deep neural network model through
   its paces last week, asking the AI to provide exact answers to more
   than 100,000 questions comprising a quiz that’s considered one of the
   world’s most authoritative machine-reading gauges. The model developed
   by Alibaba’s Institute of Data Science of Technologies scored 82.44,
   edging past the 82.304 that rival humans achieved.

   Alibaba said it’s the first time a machine has out-done a real person
   in such a contest. Microsoft achieved a similar feat, scoring 82.650 on
   the same test, but those results were finalized a day after Alibaba’s,
   the company said.

   Intelligence Can Break Free and Kill Us All

   The Chinese e-commerce titan has joined the likes of Tencent Holdings
   (TCTZF) and Baidu (BIDU) in a race to develop AI that can enrich social
   media feeds, target ads and services or even aid in autonomous driving.
   Beijing has endorsed the technology in a national-level plan that calls
   for the country to become the industry leader 2030.

   So-called natural language processing mimics human comprehension of
   words and sentences. Based on more than 500 Wikipedia articles,
   Stanford’s set of questions are designed to tease out whether
   machine-learning models can process large amounts of information before
   supplying precise answers to queries.

   Be the Best in the World’

   “That means objective questions such as ‘what causes rain’ can now be
   answered with high accuracy by machines,” Luo Si, chief scientist for
   natural language processing at the Alibaba institute, said in a
   statement. “The technology underneath can be gradually applied to
   numerous applications such as customer service, museum tutorials and
   online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the
   need for human input in an unprecedented way.”
