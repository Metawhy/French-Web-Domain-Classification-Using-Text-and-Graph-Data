eBay Open-Sourced Tools for Integrating with eBay’s APIs

   APIs are first-class products at eBay. They grow with the business and
   enable expansion to new contexts. APIs allow our developer community to
   create powerful experiences and manage their eBay business at scale.
   Our goal is a large ecosystem of developer applications that add value
   to our buyers and sellers.

   eBay Open-Source Tools

   This week, we open-sourced C# OAuth client library that will further
   simplify and streamline integration with eBay’s APIs. Controlling API
   access is crucial to the security and scale. To address data privacy,
   and some other security concerns, we leverage industry standard OAuth
   2.0 protocol. All eBay’s APIs require clients to be authorized to allow
   integration with our backend systems. When using the library, a few
   lines of code are sufficient for the authorization. The library
   supports all OAuth 2.0 grant types relevant to our APIs. This is the
   latest addition to already open-sourced tools to simplify integration
   with eBay’s APIs - we previously released Java OAuth client library and
   Java Feed SDK.

   At eBay Connect last summer, we announced that OpenAPI documents are
   available for all our RESTful APIs. We demonstrated that integration
   with read-only capabilities takes a few minutes. OAuth client libraries
   work very well when used alongside API clients generated from the
   OpenAPI documents.

   One of our goals was bringing more than one billion listings together
   to surface the greatest selection of inventory to our partners. This
   includes new, everyday items as well as rare goods - if something
   exists in the world, it is most likely for sale on eBay. Partners use
   our data feeds to create a rich selection of items and provide their
   users with a powerful consumer-centric experience. Feed SDK abstracts
   downloads and large file manipulation and simplifies complex inventory
   curation. It enables authorized partners around the globe to
   programmatically access the huge selection of eBay items and curate the
   inventory of their choice.

   Our libraries, in addition to OpenAPI documents, are convenient for
   third-parties to use and they are for sure a jump-start to integrating
   with our APIs. The SDKs are open-sourced and provide a full
   transparency to developers into what is happening in their
   integrations. Contributions from developer community are welcome.
