Thanou among four removed from Competition Committee

     * thanou_web--2-thumb-large--2

   TAGS: Politics

   Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis signed the official acts on
   Monday for the removal of four members of the Competition Commission,
   including its president, Vassiliki Thanou.
   The move came after Parliament last week passed a provision included in
   a multi-bill which stipulated that persons who have served in political
   offices cannot be appointed to the Competition Committee for five years
   from the moment they leave office.
   Apart from Thanou, who had worked as a legal adviser in the office of
   former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, vice president Anna Nakou and two
   other members were also removed.
   Thanou, a former head of the Supreme Court, was named head of the
   Competition Commission in the latter phase of SYRZA’s term in office.
