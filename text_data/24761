Mark B. McHugh President & CEO, Gatorland

   Mark B. McHugh President & CEO, Gatorland He stands beside the murky
   water. Suddenly, a crocodile explodes from the deep and chases him on
   the shore, hoping to make him lunch. Not your typical staff meeting,
   but this isn’t your typical corporate executive either. Mark McHugh,
   President and Chief Executive Officer, knows that most of the residents
   at Gatorland would just as soon eat him as look at him. At the age of
   36, McHugh took over the reins at Gatorland and has since introduced
   over 35 new attractions and exhibits at Orlando’s only attraction with
   bite and attitude. They range from one of the world’s largest
   collection of giant white alligators to free-flying lorikeets, new
   shows, animal encounters, and the Screamin’ Gator Zip Line. Each is a
   typical Mark McHugh project: exciting, entertaining, and unprecedented!
   McHugh’s goal is to provide an up-close, personalized [...]

Historical Time Line

   From Tails to Tales Stalking a Dream 1905 Owen Godwin Sr. is born and
   spends his youth on the homestead of his Uncle Lije at Rattlesnake
   Hammock, located on the Kissimmee River east of Sebring, Florida. Part
   of a ranching community known as Kissimmee Island, they were serviced
   by the steamers that carried supplies and tourists to Palm Beach from
   the railhead at Kissimmee. The kids could get an occasional tip by
   showing snakes and alligators to the passengers while their parents
   shopped. 1930’s Owen Godwin, Sr., builds an alligator pit in the
   backyard of his Sebring home, just south of Sebring, Florida. The pit
   is a sideline to Godwin’s other jobs as butcher and postmaster. His
   wife, Pearl, sells gator products – key chains, belts and the like –
   out of her kitchen. After making their purchases, customers step
   outside and stare in [...]
