   Senior Portraits
   2013-12-21_0007-595x400 We are a husband and wife team (that’s Vicki
   lighting the bride!) of portrait and wedding photographers in North
   Conway, New Hampshire. In our photography studio and on location we
   create stunningly beautiful and unique imagery of weddings, seniors,
   and families. We love getting to know the people we work with and are
   constantly striving to capture them and the most important moments in
   their lives in a polished and distinctive style. Working as a team, we
   never settle for a photo; we’ll turn OK light into great light, an
   acceptable pose into a memorable one, and a nice scene into a
   distinctive image that will be cherished forever!

A Bridal Session with Diana

   December 3, 2013jayWedding

   Recently Vicki and I had the pleasure of doing a bridal session with
   Diana. The combination of a couple great hair and make-up people,
   Diana, and a fabulous location made for a fantastic session. We were
   able to use a couple beautiful gowns provided by Inspirations bridal
   and Formal Wear of North Conway to get a couple great and different
   looks. Great work by all involved! Enjoy the photos.
