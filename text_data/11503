   The XIXth International Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL)
   Research Conference addressed the theme of Open Data, Information and
   Content, and took place from 4 to 6 July 2018 on KU Leuven’s campus in
   Bruges (Belgium). The conference welcomed contributions from
   interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives (pedagogy,
   technology, linguistics and psychology) with a view to discussing as a
   community the multiplicity of challenges inherent in the description,
   interpretation, (re-)use, and sustainable exploitation of open data,
   information and content for language learning and teaching.

Outcomes and impressions

   More than 130 delegates from over 30 countries took part in a varied
   programme. The programme comprised:
     * keynote talks by top experts in the field: Rose Luckin (University
       College London) on artificial intelligence, and Alex Boulton
       (Université de Lorraine & CNRS) on data-driven learning;
     * over 80 regular paper presentations;
     * three thought-provoking selected plenary talks;
     * an open panel for prospective authors of the Computer Assisted
       Language Learning Journal, organized by its editorial board and
       reviewers;
     * an award session for researchers who distinguished themselves in
       the field of CALL;
     * invigorating social activities in the charming medieval city of
       Bruges.

   For more detail on the programme, please refer to the programme section
   of this website. There you can also download the open access conference
   proceedings.

     Rose Luckin in key note ‘data is “crude oil”, intelligent humans
     need to define its refinement’. Critical role for educators.

     — Sake Jager (@sakejgr) July 4, 2018

     #CALL2018 Frin Rose Luckin, one of key limitations of AI is its
     inability to justify decisions. As educators we spend a lot of time
     justifying decisions!

     Teaching large classes : “teaching in the dark” (little engagement
     from students, very little feed-back to teacher) according to Irina
     Elgort (Uni Wellington, NZ) #Call2018
