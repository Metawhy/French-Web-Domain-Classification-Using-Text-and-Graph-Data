8. How We Share Your Personal Data

   We may have to share your personal information with the parties set out
   below for the purposes set out in the table in disclose personal
   information in the following situations:
   Other Disclosures with or without Your Consent.  We may disclose your
   personal information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court
   orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with
   relevant laws. We may also share your personal information in order to
   establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to
   investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal
   activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a
   violation of our policies.

   We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
   information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow
   our third-party service providers to use your personal information for
   their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal
   information for specified purposes and in accordance with our
   instructions.

9. Data Security

   We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
   personal information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in
   an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
   to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors
   and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will
   only process your personal information on our instructions and they are
   subject to a duty of confidentiality.

   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
   data breach.  In the event that we are required by law to inform you of
   any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you
   electronically, in writing, or if permitted by law, by telephone. We
   will also notify any applicable regulator of a breach where we are
   legally required to do so.
   However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
   electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to
   protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
   disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal
   information.

   Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do you
   will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for
   maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are
   responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else
   that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has
   been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of
   your password or account.

10. Data Retention

   We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary
   to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including the fulfillment
   of the contract, the initiation of a contract, or for the purposes of
   satisfying any legal, accounting, or other regulatory reporting
   requirements.

   To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information,
   we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
   information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
   disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we
   process your personal information and whether we can achieve those
   purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

11. International Transfers

   If you are based in the European Union please note that we share your
   personal information with other GumGum entities outside of the European
   Union which means we may transfer your information outside the European
   Economic Area (EEA).

   Many of our external third parties are also based outside the EEA so
   their processing of your personal information may involve a transfer of
   data outside the EEA.

   Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA, we
   ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to you by ensuring at
   least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
     * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
       contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal
       information the same protection it has in Europe.
     * Where we use providers based in the U.S., we may transfer data to
       them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
       provide similar protection to personal information shared between
       Europe and the U.S.

12. EUROPEAN UNION RESIDENTS: YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

   If you are based in the European Union please note that the laws in the
   EU (including all EU member states) will change on 25 May 2018.
   Although this Privacy Policy sets out most of your rights under the new
   laws, we may not be able to respond to some of your requests (for
   example, a request for the transfer of your personal information) until
   May 2018 as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for
   some of these changes.

   It is important that the personal information we hold about you is
   accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal
   information changes during your relationship with us.

   If you are accessing this website from the European Union, please note
   that under EU data protection laws you have the right to:


     * Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data
       subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the
       personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
       processing it.
     * Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
       This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold
       about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of
       the new data you provide to us.
     * Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us
       to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for
       us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to
       delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully
       exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we
       may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
       required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
       Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
       request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
       notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
     * Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on
       a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
       something about your particular situation which makes you want to
       object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
       fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
       where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
       purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
       legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
       rights and freedoms.
     * Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
       enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
       data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish
       the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but
       you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the
       data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
       exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our
       use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
       legitimate grounds to use it.
     * Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
       party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
       your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
       format. Note that this right only applies to automated information
       which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
       the information to perform a contract with you.
     * Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
       process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
       lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
       consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to
       provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
       this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

   If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact
   us at gdpr@gumgum.com.

13. No Charge/Fees (in most cases)

   You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or
   to exercise any of the other rights). However we may charge a
   reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
   excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in
   these circumstances.

14. What We May Need From You

   We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
   your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information
   (or to exercise any other right). This is a security measure to ensure
   that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no
   right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
   information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

15. Time Limit To Respond

   We try to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty (30) days.
   Occasionally it may take us longer to process your request if it is
   particularly complex or if you have made multiple requests.  In this
   case, we will notify you and keep you updated on the status of your
   request(s).

16. Your Right to File a Complaint

   If you are based in the European Union you also have the right to make
   a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO),
   the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues
   (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with
   your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the
   first instance.
