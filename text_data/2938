Round Coffee Table

   A friend gave this coffee table to me because it got banged up during a
   move so she had no use for it.

   I threw some blue paint on it and decided to handpaint a billion
   starfish on it.

Lane Hope Chest Makeover

   I've had this Lane hope chest for years. I re-upholstered it when I
   originally got it (used from Craigslist) but I was recently inspired to
   completely redo it due to some awesome fabric I saw at Hobby Lobby.

Dining Room Set Makeover

   I was given this dining room table set from a neighbor. I had it for
   several weeks before I got the energy to paint it (I'm currently 5 1/2
   months pregnant and it's 98 degrees here in Florida).
   [blogger-image--64326613.jpg]
   The chairs were horrible looking. When I ripped off the fabric from the
   seat cushions I realized the original fabric was orange velvet. The set
   is solid wood so I knew it was good quality, and it's from the 60's.
   [blogger-image--796553052.jpg]
   I painted everything white and then distressed it. I bought new fabric
   from Hobby Lobby. The pressed wood/partical board that held the seat
   cushions in were almost all broken and cracked. So my handy dandy
   husband cut all new seat cushion things with plywood.

Bedroom Set Undertaking

   A friend of mine asked me to redo a dresser and bedside table. She
   wanted it white antique looking with a walnut stained top. When I took
   on this project I didn't realize how large the dresser is. This thing
   was a BEAST!
   [Bedroom%2B5.jpg] [Bedroom%2B4.jpg]
   I had to sand down the tops of the furniture which was a huge task.
   [blogger-image-780233727.jpg] [blogger-image--562535632.jpg]
   After many many hours of work the furniture was painted:
   [blogger-image--1294488011.jpg]
   I watched a tutorial on YouTube on how to use wood stain to antique
   painted furniture. You can find that video here.
   It's a very messy and smelly process. My wonderful husband did this
   step for me since I'm pregnant and can't be around the strong fumes of
   wood stain.
   After distressing furniture you wipe wood stain across small sections
   of the furniture, let it sit for about 30 seconds and wipe it off with
   paper towels. It's a very neat technique. I will definitely do it
   again.

   [blogger-image--1182136872.jpg] [blogger-image-940863658.jpg]
   The knobs came from Hobby Lobby. Wait until their knobs and handles are
   half off which is basically every other week.

Black & White Lingerie Chest

   My sister-in-law gave me this lingerie chest and bedside table. She was
   going to give it to Goodwill. I have never painted anything black
   before, but I saw a piece of furniture on Pinterest that inspired me.
   [Lingerie%2BChest%2BBefore.jpg] [Side%2BTable%2BBefore.jpg]
    I used heavy duty wrapping paper to line the drawers. I think it
   really makes it pop.

  Army Trunk Redo

   This old 1947 Army trunk was a roadside rescue. I didn't know what to
   do with this trunk. At first I wanted to use it in my soon-to-be baby's
   nursery to store toys in, but then I realized that I didn't want his
   little fingers to get slammed in the lid (bad memories from my
   childhood). Besides being dirty and old, the trunk had a lot of
   character.
   [Chest%2BBefore.jpg]
   I painted it white using Valspar High Hiding White paint from Lowes.
   The worse part of this task was painting the inside. If you've ever
   painted drawers or cabinets you feel my pain. It took forever!! It
   seriously took me 4 hours to paint this trunk. I sold it for only $40,
   totally not worth the time I put in it.

Chest with Missing Drawer Makeover

   I found this chest of drawers on the curb and I seriously considered
   not taking it because it had a missing drawer. But it was solid wood
   and if nothing else came from the piece I could at least take the knobs
   off the drawers and use them on something else.
   [Chest+3.jpeg]
   A friend of mine wants me to help her decorate and furnish her bedroom.
   She fell in love with this chest, but didn't want to pay $160 for it,
   plus it wasn't real wood.
   [image.jpeg]
   After deciding she didn't care the top drawer was missing we agreed to
   move forward with trying to make the chest look like the inspiration.
   I painted it a cream color, stained the top with a walnut wood stain
   and had my husband use a piece of plywood for the shelf. I figure the
   shelf can either be used to hold a cable box or she can guy some wicker
   baskets to store socks, underwear, etc in.
   [Chest+2.jpeg]
   I bought a special stencil to use on the drawers, but the stencil
   smeared everywhere and it just didn't work. So I ended up using some
   acrylic stamps I've had for years.
