                         2017/10/30 IMPORTANT NOTICE

   In recent months, POLYGONAL DESIGN has been the target of various
   attacks on the internet involving the UNFOLD3D® software and its
   employees, as well as technological and commercial elements that have
   been used without any authorization. Given this situation, POLYGONAL
   DESIGN has seized the TGI of Marseille, which concluded on September
   28^th 2017 that POLYGONAL DESIGN is the sole and exclusive holder of
   all the rights concerning the UNFOLD3D® software since its initial
   marketing in 2003 until its version still currently marketed, called
   Generation 9. However, since this judgment currently on appeal, the
   registered software brand UNFOLD3D® is clearly used without
   authorization by other companies to promote and sell software that
   exploit largely the technologies UNFOLD3D® whose POLYGONAL DESIGN is
   only owner, resulting in the need for further lawsuits. POLYGONAL
   DESIGN is available from all media outlets who would like to talk to
   the company, and confirms that its employees are all of an indisputable
   honesty, invested for a long time for the most part in humanitarian
   work for many years. POLYGONAL DESIGN warns its customers against the
   actions of any natural or legal person usurping its brands and its
   products, or their possible relays, which will be subject to
   prosecution in court.

                     [Silver_commended_REVIEW_BADGE.png]
   '' Overall, Unfold3D 9 is a very good overhaul, and worth looking into
      if you need something that unwraps fast, with no muss or fuss. ''
