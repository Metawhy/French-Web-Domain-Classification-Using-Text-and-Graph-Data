   About & Directions:

   When I vistied, this place was listed as all-vegan on Happy Cow.
   However, since then the Happy Cow entry has been updated to indicate
   that some items contain milk and eggs. Because of this, I can’t
   guarantee that all of the items that I chose (& photographed) are vegan
   – please ask before buying! A Happy Cow user wrote that the staff are
   super helpful, so if you tell them you’re vegan they’ll be able to
   point out which items to avoid. A bummer for sure, but it seems they
   still have a lot of vegan options!  It’s kind of pain in the ass to get
   to (although it’s a short walk, it’s a lot of turns and walking up and
   down hills), so make sure you’re wearing appropriate shoes for walking.

   Restaurant Review:

   I’ll be honest – I went here aaaaaaagessss ago (August 2015, to be
   exact), and I’m just getting around to posting about it now.  So I
   won’t fuss too much over probably-misremembered details.  Instead, lots
   of photos!

   Also, to reiterate:  When I went here this restaurant was listed as
   all-vegan.  Now it is not, and some items contain milk or eggs. Please
   ask the owner which items are vegan-friendly!  Even if it’s
   photographed here it may not actually be vegan 😦

   [IMG_2876_zps1duxqv5o.jpg]

   As you may have guess Macrovenus and Pan Yakibito produces almost
   exclusively baked goods.  This includes various types of freshly-baked
   breads, and a variety of sweets and savories.

   [IMG_2888_zpsnyvici8g.jpg]

   There’s a selection of popular Japanese-flavored sweet breads,
   including red-bean filled buns, Melon Pan, and  kinako-flavored
   (roasted soybean flour) cream bun.

   [IMG_2877_zpsibts553u.jpg]

   There’s also plenty of pastries that will be more familiar to the
   foreign visitor, including croissants, chocolate coronets, and tons of
   others luscious cream-filled pastries.

   [IMG_2879_zpsa043pgqo.jpg]

   [IMG_2880_zpsoagoppsv.jpg]

   [IMG_2882_zpsrhwxr2mi.jpg]

   Being a sweets fanatic, I went straight for the Melon Pan (a Japanese
   favorite that is sold everywhere), a cream-filled and sugar-bedecked
   bun, and a croissant.  The Melon Pan was amazing – I’ve never had
   non-vegan melon pan so I can’t say how comparable it is, but it was
   very sweet, crunchy and delightful.  The cream-filled bun was similarly
   delicious.

   [IMG_2886_zpszdazjthf.jpg]

   The croissant was good, but didn’t have the light, buttery flakiness
   that I remember croissants having back-in-the-omnivore-day.  That said,
   it was still a very satisfying.  I won’t bite the hand that feeds me
   vegan croissants.

   [IMG_2906_zpsqqmip2rp.jpg]

   The inside is simple, casual, and wonderfully well-lit.  I’m a sucker
   for big windows – I’ve been inside a few too many dingy cafes.
   Supposedly (reports from HappyCow users) they no longer serve lunch and
   dinner, but their website still suggests that they do.

   [IMG_2891_zpswqsu2d7a.jpg]

   Overall, is it worth the trip?  If you have the time, absolutely!  It
   is a bit of a walk, but if you have a craving for European-style breads
   or vegan pastries, then this is the place to go.  If you don’t think
   you’re up for the trek, however, Lima Cafe also frequently sells a
   small selection of their baked goods, on a small wooden shelving unit
   at the front of the restaurant.

   About & Directions:

   Shigetsu is a restaurant located within Tenryu-ji, a Buddhist Temple in
   Arashiyama, Kyoto.  The restaurant specializes in Japanese Zen Buddhist
   cuisine (Shojin Ryori), which is traditionally entirely vegan.
   Although different temples do vary a bit from this rule, Shigetsu is
   quite strict.  Shojin Ryori is a must-try experience, and with such
   moderate prices and an incredibly beautiful setting, Shigetsu is a
   great choice (Another excellent option is Ajiro, which is also vegan
   and has a Michelin star).   It’s a good idea to make reservations,
   since it is popular.

   Address, Access & Contact:
     * Special Note: Shigetsu is located WITHIN Tenryu-ji’s gardens.  You
       must pay a ¥500 entrance fee to go in. (It’s well worth it)

   Restaurant Review:

   I’m not even sure how to review this place.  I’m not a chef or a
   connoisseur by any means, and my typical rating system is merely based
   on whether or not I want to keep eating until I feel like I’ve ruptured
   something.    Eating at Shigetsu is an entirely different experience,
   requiring an appreciation of the presentation and the variety of
   textures & flavors created with simple ingredients.  I can appreciate a
   good ice cream sundae, but appreciating something this much more subtle
   was an unusual experience for me.

   I know I took notes as I ate, then lost them somewhere, so I’ll just
   have to work from memory.  First off, I arrived early and spent my time
   wandering around Tenryuji’s incredible gardens.  Definitely give
   yourself extra time so that you can really appreciate the place –
   you’re going to pay the ¥500 entrance fee anyways, you might as well
   get your money’s worth!  Personally I’d recommend going before your
   meal, simply because I was stuffed afterwards I really wasn’t in a
   position to appreciate natural beauty (although wouldn’t a nap here be
   nice?)

   DSC_0456

   Once I entered, they asked if I had a reservation, and after a short
   wait led me into a large, traditional Japanese tatami-mat room with a
   long red carpet rolled out on each side.   The middle of the room was
   broken by sliding doors, which broke the large room into two smaller
   rooms.  It appeared that Japanese guests were served in one room, while
   foreigners were served in another, which was kind of weird (but maybe
   it was just a coincidence).  The dining style was communal, so I sat on
   the red carpet along with various other visitors, and ordered my meal.

   I ordered the Yuki set (¥3,000, not including the ¥500 yen entrance fee
   to Tenryuji Gardens), mainly because I wanted to experience Zen cuisine
   but also wanted to keep to my budget.  I was concerned that, since the
   food was high-quality, ¥3,000 might only get me a very small meal.  In
   actuality, however,  it was MORE than enough food – in fact I’m not
   sure how anyone is able to eat the larger sets.  I have a pretty
   healthy appetite, but over the course of nearly 2 hours I just barely
   managed to finish my meal.  I was simultaneously concerned about
   overstaying my welcome and nervous that leaving food uneaten might be
   incredibly disrespectful.
   DSC_0434

   ¥3,000 Lunch Set (not including 2 other sides)

   The set was enormous: rice, soup, pickles, 5 other vegetables sides
   along with a sliced melon for dessert.  Each side dish consisted of
   different vegetable-based ingredients prepared in unique ways, from a
   starchy-tasting cold soup, to cold soft tofu in a light sauce, to what
   seemed like grilled eggplant slathered in a rich miso paste.  I
   couldn’t identify a lot of what I was eating, but since I knew it was
   all vegan the experience was pretty exciting (food mysteries are
   usually unpleasant when you’re vegan, so this was fun!).

   And one perfect slice of melon for dessert!

   Everything was clearly prepared with care and an larger vision of how
   each would work in the set as a whole.  I’ll admit that I didn’t much
   care for the soup (it was definitely based in something starchy, and
   the texture was unusual for me), and I found that the miso on the
   eggplant was a bit too thick and somewhat overwhelming.  However, I
   would still go again – it’s important to get out of your comfort zone
   with food!

   I found that sitting for so long on the floor was a bit uncomfortable,
   so if you have knee or back problems, please be aware that you will be
   eating from the floor and a lot of sitting and bending is involved.  I
   liked the communal setting, since it was fun to see how the people near
   me reacted to what they at, but I was also a little confused by what
   seemed to be segregation (but again, maybe I misinterpreted it or it
   was a coincidence).  Everyone was generally quiet and respectful, so in
   spite of sitting so near to other I was able to relax and appreciate
   the food.

   Overall, I’d recommend that anyone wanting to try out Shojin Ryori
   consider Shigetsu – I haven’t tried Shojin Ryori at other temples in
   the area, so I can’t say it’s the best, but the location is beautiful
   and the food excellent.  ¥3,000 may seem steep at first glance, but for
   an enormous amount of food and a truly memorable cultural experience,
   it’s a great deal!

   About & Location:

   Mumokuteki is a omnivorous (but extremely vegan-friendly) restaurant
   located on Teramachi-dori in central Kyoto.  It’s a bit hard to find,
   as it’s located inside of a building behind a small shop (also called
   Mumokuteki), and up a flight of stairs.  Keep an eye out for a large
   menu posted just inside the entrance, near the shop.  It’s often very
   crowded, so go up the stairs and they may give you a number.  You then
   go back downstairs to a small waiting room to wait for your number to
   be called.  (I was really confused by this and kept walking around the
   waiting room trying to find the restaurant.  Pretty sure the other
   people waiting thought I was crazy!)  To avoid the wait, you can call
   and make reservations on weekdays (non-holidays).

   waiting room.

   Restaurant Review:

   I didn’t come to Mumokuteki during my first trip to Kyoto because I was
   put off by the “omnivore” label – I generally prefer to eat at
   all-vegan restaurants, since it’s nice to not have to worry about
   anything you’re eating.  However, during my second visit I stayed at
   Khaosan Kyoto Theater, a hostel located very nearby on Gokomachi-dori.
    When I recognized it as a restaurant I’d seen on Happy Cow, I decided
   to give it a shot.  I’m SO grateful I did!

   Everything at Mumokuteki is vegan EXCEPT that some items contain fish.
    In the past these items weren’t clearly labeled, which lead to some
   very unhappy vegetarians and some poor reviews on Happy Cow.  However,
   they’ve since made their menu much more clear, and now mark all
   fish-containing dishes on the menu (look for a little fish-shaped
   icon).  Since it’s not a strictly vegan restaurant, I’d also be
   cautious regarding honey.  I asked if any of the dishes contained honey
   and my waitress said no, but my Japanese is a bit rusty, so I’d
   recommend you also ask when you order.

   I went for dinner during my first visit, and because I arrived at peak
   dinner time I had to take a number and wait for about 20 minutes.
   However, once I got a seat I ordered the ヘルシー豆腐ハンバーグ丼ロコモコ風 (Healthy
   Tofu Hamburger Rice Bowl, Loco Moco Style) for ¥950.  Loco Moco is a
   modern Hawaiian dish that usually consists of hamburger, fried egg and
   gravy over rice.  I thought Mumokuteki did a really great veganization
   of it, using a rich white sauce in the place of fried eggs.  It also
   came with a  side of fried lotus root, which I thought was  a really
   unique touch!  Overall, every part of the dish was delicious.
   DSC_0398

   Healthy Tofu Hamburger Rice Bowl, Loco Moco Style

   Even though I was really full after eating, I had to make room after
   seeing their selection of desserts!  I ended up ordering the ティラミスパフェ
   (Tiramisu Parfait) for ¥620, a soft-serve parfait garnished with chunks
   for Tiramisu cake and frozen berries.  After eating so well, I did have
   a little trouble finishing it, but it was really incredible!  If I’d
   planned better, I probably would have saved this for a teatime visit
   though, so I could really appreciate it on a less-bursting stomach!
   DSC_0401

   Tiramisu Parfait (¥620)

   DSC_0402

   A few days later, I came back for lunch with some friends I made at my
   hostel.  This time, I tried the 味噌カツプレート(Deep-Fried Cutlet Miso
   Style) ¥1,150, which consisted of deep fried tofu slathered in a
   miso-based sauce, with a side of rice, soup, pickles, lotus root chips,
   and more!  After doing some research, I found that Miso Katsu is a
   specialty from Nagoya Prefecture.  Usually I like to eat local dishes
   in their native home, but really, what other chance was I going to have
   to try this vegan-style?  So I gave it a shot!  I have to admit I
   didn’t like it quite as much as the Loco Moco Rice Bowl – the cutlets
   were so stiff and crunchy that it was a bit much for my tender palate.
    The miso sauce was great though, and the variety and attention to
   detail in the side-dishes really made the meal!

   DSC_0522

   DSC_0525
   DSC_0524

   Pickles!

   The restaurant itself is large, well-lit, and very tastefully
   decorated.  White cafe tables stand near the windows in front, while
   large wooden tables take up the rest of the restaurant.  Both times I
   went it was packed, although the lunch crowd seemed less overwhelming
   and there was a much shorter wait.  Service was relatively quick given
   how busy they were, and the waiters seemed happy to answer questions.

   Overall, Mumokuteki was definitely worth visiting!  The quality was
   consistently good, the variety and originality of the dishes was
   intriguing, and the overall atmosphere relaxing in spite of the number
   of customers.  My only complaint is the long wait times, but I guess
   that’s the price you have to pay when you go to a hip restaurant.  I’d
   definitely recommend eating here if you’re nearby, but I would also
   recommend making a reservation if you’re planning on stopping by during
   the week (they only accept weekday, non-holiday reservations)!  And
   definitely get dessert!

Vegan Kamikochi 上高地

   May 7, 2016 / therrymonk13 / Leave a comment

   Kamikochi is an incredible, stupidly picturesque area of the Northern
   Japanese Alps in Nagano Prefecture.  It’s accessible by bus from
   Takayama (Gifu Prefecture),  so while staying in Takayama I squeezed in
   a day trip here.  You do have to transfer buses in Hirayu Onsen, which
   is a little annoying, but if you plan your day well you can take
   advantage of the onsen there during the wait!  So all-in-all it’s a
   pretty enjoyable day trip.
   DSC_0118

   Worth the bus ride

   The thing-to-do in Kamikochi is hike, and it’s easy to burn a lot of
   calories there.  I wasn’t sure what the food scene would be like, so I
   ended up packing a really unnecessarily large amount of food.  As it
   turned out, there were actually numerous shops with vegan options!

   DSC_0113

   The first place I stopped at was アルピコショップ (Arupico Shop) which is right
   next to the Kamikochi Bus Terminal.  Arupico Shop which carries various
   snacks as well as various types of Oyaki & Mochi.  Oyaki is basically
   just a delicious soba bun filled with whatever, and luckily for vegans
   that “whatever” often is vegetables.  Mochi are rice cakes, and every
   region and shop has it’s own kind.

   DSC_0115

   Vegetable Oyaki is almost always vegan.  However, because there’s
   always the chance of sneaky fish-or-shrimp ingredients, I always make
   sure to ask before buying.  I actually didn’t end up buying oyaki from
   this shop, because I’d brought a lot of food, but I did buy some frozen
   oyaki from a shop further down the road (towards the hiking trails).
   Still, it’s much better to eat the fresh, so if you have a chance ask
   at this shop to make sure they’re vegan and get some!  They have
   つばあん(Tsubuan, sweet bean),  かぼちゃ(kabocha, pumpkin), なす (nasu,
   eggplant), ピリ辛野菜(Piri Kara Yasai, Spicy Vegetables), and 野沢菜(Nozawana,
   mustard leaf).  All of these are likely vegan.
   DSC_0110

   うまかっぺもち　Umakappe Mochi

   They also had various types of grilled mochi (rice cake).  I opted for
   the Umakappe Mochi (a type of Age Mochi, fried mochi), after asking to
   make sure it didn’t have any fish sauce in the sauce.  It was grilled
   in soy sauce with a few pieces of nori seaweed on top.   It was
   sooooooo gooood, and a perfect high-energy snack for a hike!
   DSC_0163

   Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!

   And, since I had to wait for my return bus for a while, I picked up
   some local beer.  One of the things I really miss about Japan is being
   able to just sip a beer in public without looking like a raging
   alcoholic.  So refreshing!

   If you end up traveling to Kamikochi, I’d recommend bringing a small
   meal and some protein source to sustain you, since finding a full
   vegan-friendly meal at any of the area’s restaurants is unlikely.  But
   there are plenty of options of high-energy, vegan-friendly and
   downright delicious snacks available, so you certainly won’t go hungry
   during your visit!





Takayama – Vegan Local Specialties

   March 5, 2016March 5, 2016 / therrymonk13 / 2 Comments

   Takayama is a small city located in the middle of the Japanese Alps, in
   the northern portion of Gifu Prefecture.  The region’s geography and
   climate has fostered a unique food culture. Although you’ll see quite a
   lot of beef on the menus (one of Takayama’s specialities is Hida Beef,
   or Hida-gyuu), theres no need to come bearing a sack of instant meals.
    With an emphasis on mountain vegetables and a liberal use of miso
   (fermented soy bean paste), there’s plenty of local food that vegans
   can enjoy, if you know what to look for!

   I.  Hoba Miso (朴葉味噌) & Miso

   When I visited Takayama I was hell-bent on trying one particular local
   dish – Hoba Miso ( 朴葉味噌).  Hoba Miso consists of spring onions,
   mushrooms, other vegetables, and often slices of Hida Beef cooked in
   miso over a magnolia leaf.  Obviously you’ll want to look for one
   without the be

   I didn’t go about my search in a particularly organized fashion – I
   pretty much just walked up and down the streets hoping to find a place
   that had it on the menu.  Luckily they were plentiful, and I ended up
   heading into one restaurant with it on the menu.  I wish I remembered
   the name of it – it was so cozy and the staff were so kind.  They were
   happy to make Hoba Miso without the meat, and I asked to make sure they
   didn’t add any fish sauce, just in case. It was so good!  Just
   mushroom, green onions, veggies and miso grilled on a magnolia leaf,
   with a bowl of fresh rice & a glass of sake.  Simple, perfect.

   There is, of course, always a small risk that the miso used might
   contain some flavorings/additives that aren’t vegan, so if you’re
   nervous and would prefer something where you can read the ingredients,
   you can also buy do-it-yourself kits and souvenir shops throughout
   Takayama!  I’ve long since resigned myself to the ever-present and
   ambiguous “アミノ酸等” that seems to be nestled at the end of every
   ingredients list, but if you keep looking you may be able to find some
   with more clear ingredients.
   DSC_0164

   Hoba Miso Kits

   Miso is very important in Hida-Takayama cooking, and not just for
   making Hoba Miso.  The harsh winters and scarcity of seafood made miso
   a critical component of the region’s cooking, and thus Takayama has
   become known for it’s miso. You can find miso manufacturer’s in the Old
   Town, and various types and flavors of miso in it’s souvenir shops.
   Since miso is such a versatile ingredient, it makes  great souvenir!

   II. Mitarashi Dango (みたらしだんご）

   Takayama is also well known for it’s Mitarashi Dango, and you can find
   stalls selling the treats throughout town (especially in the old town
   district).  If you’ve been in Japan for a while you’re no doubt
   familiar with Mitarashi Dango.  However, the kind I ate in Takayama
   were markedly different from the sticky, smooth, and often overwhelming
   sweet treats I was used to guiltily buying from convenience stores.
   The sauce on the Takayama version seemed to be much less liberally
   slathered in sauce,  and the sauce itself seems to have a higher ratio
   of soy sauce to sugar.  In addition, they were grilled much more
   thoroughly, giving them a more interesting texture than their smooth
   combini-counterparts.  The result was more savory than sweet, but still
   quite delicious.

   III. Vegetables:  Sansai Ryouri & Tsukemono

   The Hida-Takayama region is also famous for it’s veggies – fresh,
   cooked, or pickled, vegetables have a huge influence on the local
   cuisine. In fact, there’s an entire school of cooking (called Sansai
   Ryouri) based on the use of wild mountain vegetables, ferns, and herbs.
    As with many vegetable dishes in Japan, though, the prevalent presence
   of vegetables is rarely indicative of a vegetarian dish – often fish
   sauce or other seafood is used at some point in the cooking process.
   However, if you don’t mind trying your luck, it seems that Suzuya is
   well-known for it’s vegetables dishes.

   DSC_0176

   If you aren’t feeling confident in your ability to negotiate
   ingredients with chef’s, though, that doesn’t mean you have to absent
   yourself from enjoying Takayama’s vegetable delights.  You can still
   have a wonderful and  interactive experience exploring the offerings at
   Takayama’s morning markets.   There are two morning markets: one along
   the Miyagawa River, and another in front of Takayama Jinja. They’re
   fairly small, but each has plenty of vendors selling fresh vegetables,
   fruits and pickles from the Hida Takayama region.  They often offer a
   huge variety of free samples, making it all the more easy to decide
   what to buy!  However, a word of warning:  Read the backs of the
   packages before buying.  Some tsukemono (pickles) do contain small
   amounts of animal products/flavorings, so it’s always better to check!
   DSC_0197

   IV.  Hida Soba & Yomogi Udon

   The Hida region’s climate is ideal for growing buckwheat, so it should
   come as no surprise that soba is one of Takayama’s specialities.
   Honestly, I’ve never been a huge soba person, so I’ll admit that I
   passed up trying this while I was there.

   However, I’m a huge udon fan, and will never pass up a chance to try a
   new and exciting type of udon.  So when I learned that Takayama’s shops
   sold udon filled with mashed yomogi (mugwort, a wild mountain herb), I
   had to try it.  I ended up bringing it home and made a delicious soup
   with it, and although I didn’t think the mugwort had a very strong
   flavor, it was quite pleasant.  If you like yomogi, you can also try
   various other yomogi-flavored foods while in Takayama:  yomogi mochi,
   yomogi-flavored peanuts, and even yomogi shochu!  I wish I’d had a
   chance to try more!

   IMG_3669

   V. Sake (Nihonshu, 日本酒）

   And last but not least, SAKE!  Takayama is also famous for it’s sake,
   and you can find numerous old sake breweries throughout the Old Town
   district, marked by large cedar balls at their entrances.  You can
   sample sake at the breweries or at restaurants throughout Takayama.
   While there’s no guarantee that sake is refined using animal products,
   I find that this is very rarely the case (at least according to
   Barnivore’s sake listings).  Unfortunately there isn’t a lot of
   information regarding smaller breweries, but if you Japanese ability is
   strong enough, visiting the breweries themselves would offer a great
   opportunity to ask!

   Restaurant Review:

   I only stayed in Takayama for 2 days, with the intention of spending 1
   of the days exploring Kamikochi, so I really only had 1 night to try
   Okahsan. Unfortunately, I got in too late to try the lunch set, and
   realized that my only chance to eat here would be if I could get in for
   dinner.  Their website specifies that they only accept dinner
   reservations of 2 or more guests, and as I was a single traveler, I
   realized that I might not be able to get in.  But I got lucky!  Just as
   I walked up, two other foreign travelers were also making dinner
   reservations.  Since they met their minimum number of dinner guests,
   they were happy to add me too.  So, if you’re a single traveler and you
   want to eat dinner here, don’t give up!  You’ll be able to get a
   reservation so long as others have made reservations as well.

   DSC_0091

   If you want to make dinner reservations, come in before they close (at
   6:00pm) and make a reservation.  They’ll expect you to make a 50%
   downpayment, which was ¥1620 including tax.  The total cost for dinner
   is ¥3000, or ¥3240 with tax.  It includes a deluxe set meal that
   changes each day, but includes a variety of soups, grains, veggies, a
   drink and a dessert.

   DSC_0102

   DSC_0095

   DSC_0094

   All of the food was delicious, but the highlight of the meal by far was
   the deep fried tofu. It was rich and delicious, with a cool lightly
   melon-flavored sauce on top.  The contrast was just incredible – I’ve
   never tasted anything quite like it before.
   DSC_0099

   Fried Tofu with Melon Sauce

   The dessert was apple sauce. Originally I was somewhat disappointed –
   I’m really cake-and-ice-cream kinda girl, and I don’t consider
   applesauce a dessert worthy of the name. However, this was a cut-above
   any applesauce I’ve ever tried before – more like a sweet apple
   pudding, smooth and rich.  Still not what I would have ordered myself,
   but sometimes set-meals are a great way to get out of your comfort
   zone!
   DSC_0103

   Dessert (applesauce)

   The set was beautiful, the food plentiful and quite tasty.  Was it wort
   ¥3240?  Honestly, not really.  For that price you can treat yourself to
   some pretty fancy Shojin Ryori in Kyoto.  I was a little sore at paying
   so much for dinner when I could have just gotten Lunch Set C (the
   deluxe set) for ¥2000, which appears to be almost identical. However,
   I’m not going to knock off points for that – I merely recommend that if
   you have the availability, come in for lunch instead.  The lunch menu
   simply offers more variety and a better value.  They offer Vegan Ramen
   (¥800) in various different flavors, including miso, soy sauce, salt,
   and sesame miso.  They also offer various seasonal specials, such as
   the Curry Rice and Ramen Salad offered below.

   DSC_0093

   There’s also several lunch sets at different price-points.  Lunch Set
   A, the Basic Plate (¥1,000),  includes brown rice, miso soup,
   煮物(stewed vegetables), 和え物(chopped veggies with dressing) or
   揚げ物(deep-fried food), and 漬け物（pickled vegetables).

   Lunch Set B – Okaasan Set (¥1500) has everything from Set A, plus a
   seasonal salad, 炒め物(stir-fried food), and a drink.

   Lunch Set C, the Deluxe Macro Meal (¥2000) is even bigger that Set B.
   It has everything from Set B, but includes both 和え物(chopped veggies
   with dressing) AND 揚げ物(deep-fried food), and dessert.  Essentially it
   would look like what I got for dinner, but a lot less expensive!  Seems
   like a great deal to me!

   Restaurant Review:

   When I visited Kanazawa, I intended to visit all of its vegan
   restaurants (Including Los Angeles in Kanazawa, Noppokun, and Takano).
    I was staying at Guest House Shiro (go stay there!  It’s old and
   beautiful!), and was surprised when I looked at my map to find that Los
   Angeles in Kanazawa was only a few blocks away.  And… well, after
   trying their food on my first day, I just never made it around to those
   other restaurants.  Whoops.  I ended up eating there every day during
   my 3 day stay in Kanazawa, and I have no regrets.

   Ok, I’m going to admit I’m very bad blogger.  I took this trip last
   summer, took a bunch of notes on everything I ate and… I have no idea
   where they are.  Sooooo instead of fudging the details, I’m going to
   have to let the photos speak for me!  Everything I ate there was
   delicious and totally worth the price.

   The first day, I continued to pursue my lifelong goal of eating
   every-veggie-burger-ever and ordered the Ginger Steak Hamburger Plate
   (¥1,380).  The set includes a soy hamburger, a salad, and 1 drink from
   their drink set list.  In spite of the small appearance of the patty,
   this was an absolutely delicious take on a veggie burger.  At ¥1,380 it
   was a bit pricy, but given the free drink and large size of the salad,
   overall I’d say the price was fairly reasonable.
   DSC_0219

   Ginger Steak Hamburger Set (¥1,380)

   DSC_0220

   For my drink, I ordered the Soymilk and Cinnamon Amakoji. Amakoji is
   the base used to make Amazake, a sweet nonalcoholic drink that tastes
   similar to sweet sake.  It’s made from fermented brown rice fermented.
    This wasn’t included on the Drink Set list, but they included it in
   the cost of the set anyways! So sweet!  They also have a good selection
   of teas and coffee from the US (including San Francisco-based
   Intelligentsia Coffee), so if you’re missing home, that’s a great
   option too!
   DSC_0217

   Soy & Cinnamon Genmai Amakoji (¥450)

   The next time I went in, I got the Summer Veggie Hot Noodle Plate
   (¥1,380).  This also included a side-salad and drink.  I didn’t find it
   super-spicy, but if you’re sensitive to spice I wouldn’t recommend it.
    It had a mild miso base, rice noodles, and was topped with strips of
   daikon radish and red pepper.

   Look at those veggies!  (Also I’m sorry this picture kinda sucks)

   On my way out of town I stopped in for one last yummy meal, and got the
   Summer Vegi Cold Noodle Plate (¥1,380): a heap of thin rice noodles
   delicately covered with thinly sliced vegetables and vegan “ham”.  It
   came with a side of soup, veggies, and a heap of karashi (spicy
   Japanese mustard).  I think this was my favorite meal from there – the
   perfect antidote to the oppressive summer heat.

   If you’ve read my blog you know I’m a total sugar-addict I definitely
   choose restaurants based on how plentiful their dessert menu is.  Los
   Angeles in Kanazawa has a pretty good dessert menu, but unfortunately
   when I visited a lot of their cakes weren’t available.  So, I opted for
   the muffins, which were amazing!  The flavors changed every day: Chai
   banana, banana, green tea, chocolate chip, chocolate berry, and more!
   Every day I bought two more (it was kind of embarrassing since
   obviously the staff could tell how many I was eating haha).  Each one
   was moist, delicious, and perfectly flavored.  I realize ¥300 for a
   muffin might seem like a lot to a traveling American, but it’s actually
   not that bad for Japan.

   On my last day, as I was leaving, the store owner gave me a box of
   cookies for free! I originally wasn’t going to buy them because they
   were so small and it didn’t seem like a good value, but I’m glad I got
   them.  They were SO delicious – a perfect sweet, rich, crumbly texture
   like a Russian Tea Cake.  If you have a little extra money to spare,
   I’d definitely recommend trying them.

   Vegan Cookies (¥400)

   Los Angeles in Kanazawa tries to capture the feel of a Los Angeles
   Cafe. I haven’t been there in a long time, so I can’t say how
   accurately it does so, but it definitely has a very vibrant atmosphere.
      The walls are covered in art, and bookshelves are interspersed
   between tables.  The storefront even has a basket filled with local
   vegetables for sale.  There was a real sense that this wasn’t intended
   to just be a place to eat food, but a place to gather and enjoy life.
   It was a great place to just sip tea and relax after rushing around
   sight-seeing all day.  The staff are super-friendly and helpful, and
   happy to chat with you about Kanazawa. Overall, I loved this place!  I
   hope I get to visit again soon!

Vegan-friendly Tokyo Grocery Stores

   January 10, 2015January 10, 2015 / therrymonk13 / 12 Comments

   Okay, the name is a bit misleading. Obviously most Japanese grocery
   stores are vegan friendly simply because they’re loaded with fruits,
   veggies, and tofu products. However, today I want to introduce Tokyo
   grocery stores that might have typically hard-to-find vegan products,
   especially processed foods that you wouldn’t be able to find at a
   typical supermarket.  This is by no means and exhaustive list – they’re
   just places I’ve personally visited or heard of.

   Natural House is an organic-foods grocery chain, and has locations in
   various parts of  Tokyo, including Shimokitazawa, Aoyama, Meguro,
   Ogikubo, Nihonbashi, and many other areas (a full list can be found in
   Japanese on their website here).  However, the store that I visit most
   frequently is the Aoyama location, which is located near the
   intersection Aoyama Dori and Omotesando Dori.  It’s just a 5-10 minute
   walk from both Pure Cafe and Brown Rice Cafe.

   Natural House specializes in organic goods, and has  a moderate
   selection of organically-produced produce.  What will likely be of more
   interest to visitors, however, is their selection of to-go lunch bowls
   and sandwiches, many of which are vegan.  All of the prepared foods
   that are vegetarian are labelled with green “for vegetarian” stickers,
   and allergen labels will warn for contents such as milk or eggs (I
   would recommend asking about honey).

   They also have a juice bar in the front, for those who are looking for
   a filling on-the-go snack.  This juice bar also sells vegan ice cream!

   P1020994

   For those who are hear longer-term, there is also a large selection of
   vegan and vegetarian products that often would not otherwise be vegan,
   such as Japanese curry roux, instant ramen, vegan bread, soy margarine,
   soy mayonnaise, tempei, vegan gyoza, vegan mock-meats, and much more.
   Many of these products are Japanese, but they also have some imported
   goods as well.  All vegetarian products are marked as such (on the tags
   below them with the price), and milk and eggs are marked as allergens.
    Check the ingredients labels for honey (はちみつ or ハチミツ).

   As you would expect, things here are generally pricier than at your
   typical grocery.  However, most of these items are difficult (if
   impossible) to find at any normal grocery store, so it’s definitely
   worth a visit and, in my opinion, worth the cost!

   While hardly a vegan store, National Azabu is an import store that has
   a large number of products that would make any vegan giddy:  Amy’s
   Vegan Pizzas, soy mayonnaise, Shreese, lentils, imported dark
   chocolate, rice milk, even vegan tortillas.  It’s just a short walk
   away from Island Veggie, and well worth a look around if you’re missing
   something from home.  It’s expensive, but worth checking out if you
   really feel you’re missing something.

   They also have another store near Den-en-Chofu Station, called National
   Den-En.

   Lima Health Shop is a small healthy food store operated in the same
   building as Lima Cafe in Shinjuku, Tokyo.  Unlike Lima cafe, Lima
   Health Shop doesn’t exclusively sell vegan products.  However, they do
   have an impressive selection of of vegan-friendly foods, including
   small pots of flavored vegan cream cheese (perfect for bagels!), lots
   of imported and domestic vegan snacks, and a huge freezer filled with
   vegan ice cream!  They also have a small selection of vegan bento
   (lunch) boxes at the front, and several of these are vegan as well.

   Restaurant Review:

   Loving Hut is an international chain of vegan restaurants run by Chiang
   Hai, a Vietnamese spiritual leader.  It’s the largest chain of vegan
   restaurants in the worlds, and while the ever-present videos of the
   Supreme Master and her followers can be a little distracting and
   off-putting to new visitors, the food at Loving Huts seems to be pretty
   consistently delicious and inventive.  The Tokyo location is no
   exception:  they offer a small but delicious selection of
   Taiwanese/Chinese, Japanese and international dishes for very
   reasonable prices, as well as a more expensive weekly buffet.  They
   also have lunch boxes and steam buns for take-out, which is great for
   tourists on-the-go.

   Several years ago, I visited their old location and tried the Vegan
   Kabayaki, a sort of mock grilled unagi eel-over-rice dish.  While it’s
   probably the only place you’ll find a vegan version of something so
   unique, I didn’t find it that appealing.  That said, I’ve never had
   actual eel, but I can imagine I would like it much either, so I won’t
   use that as a point against them.  That’s what I get from trying
   something new!

   The second time I went, I ordered the Dim Sum Lunch Set for ¥1000
   (pretty cheap by Tokyo’s vegan cafe standards).  The Dim Sum Set
   includes the Taiwanese Delicatessen Plate, and your choice of one of 4
   steam-bun dumpling sets. Lunch Sets are only served during the lunch
   hour, from 11:30 -14:00.

   Delicatessen Plate

   The delicatessen plate included Radish Rice Cake, a mock omelette
   square, a faux meat skewer, summer rolls, a spicy “shrimp” salad, and a
   noodle salad.  Each items was beautifully prepared. and tasted
   delicious.  While there are other vegan Taiwanese places in Tokyo, the
   deli plate is a wonderful chance to sample a number of different
   Taiwanese dishes.

   I ordered Dim Sum Set B, which included 1 Vegetable Bun, 1 Black
   Vinegar Veg Pork Bun, and 2 pieces of Shumai dumplings. The Deli Plate
   was really good, but the steam buns and shumai were the highlight of
   the meal – they were fluffy, chewy, and incredibly flavorful.  The
   Black Vinegar Veg Pork Bun was my personal favorite – I could have
   eaten them for lunch every day. It also came with Douhua, a delicious
   tofu pudding.  In addition, I ordered Taiwanese Tea – I’m not sure
   exactly what type of tea it was, but it was delicious.

   The decor was kind of boring and unstylish, and like all Loving Huts
   they had songs from the Supreme Master and her followers playing (I
   think there was  TV playing them, but I can’t remember).  I personally
   find this distracting and a little strange, since I’m not a follower.
   But hey, it’s their restaurant and they serve some damn good food, so I
   can’t complain too much.  The staff were incredibly friendly (as
   always), and my waitress spoke English!  I of course can’t guarantee
   that  all servers do, but if you’re nervous about ordering in Japanese
   they may be able to help.

   P1030244

   Overall, I definitely recommend visiting this Loving Hut location.  It
   has some delicious food for really reasonable prices, and with it’s
   central location and take-out dishes, it’s ideal for visiting tourists.

The Great Tokyo Vegan Donut Quest

   January 7, 2015January 7, 2015 / therrymonk13 / Leave a comment

   When my friends came to visit me in Tokyo last July, we set out on an
   epic quest, a quest for an treasure so rare and delightful that at
   first we doubted it’s very existence:  the vegan Tokyo donut.  Sadly,
   as our primary destination was the fabled La Terre, our adventure was
   wrought with sorrow…

   1. La Terre’s Donuts – NOT quite Vegan!

   We’d heard that La Terre, located right across from T’s Tantan in Tokyo
   Station, had a pretty big assortment of vegan donuts.  So, we
   hightailed it from Shinjuku Station, desperate for a bit of these
   amazing donuts.

   P1050824

   Not everything was milk free, but surprisingly, 6 of their donuts
   listed only soy and wheat as allergens!  We were ecstatic, and picked
   out our favorites. However, at the last second I started to wonder…
   what about honey?

   Unfortunately, after asking the incredibly friendly and helpful staff
   about the ingredients, they confirmed that ALL of the donuts –
   including the rumored vegan donuts – contained honey. 😦  So,
   unfortunately, unless you’re a honey-eating-vegan, these donuts aren’t
   for you.  It’s such a shame, they were SO close, and they looked so
   delicious!

   My friends had to head back home, so unfortunately, they were unable to
   complete the mission.  However, I was not to be deterred…

   2. Doughnut Plant NYC “Bakery Donut” (¥260 Each) – sometimes VEGAN!

   There’s been a lot of confusion surrounding Doughnut Plant NYC’s
   vegan-ness, so I’d like to set the record straight.  Doughnut Plant NYC
   has branches in the US as well as in Japan, and they use different
   recipes. Doughnut Plant NYC (US) has no vegan options.  Doughnut Plant
   NYC (Japan) used to have many vegan options, which were sold at Eat
   More Greens in Azabu-Juban and at Doughnut Plant NYC’s various Tokyo
   locations.  However, in the last few years they’ve cut back on these
   options.  The donuts served at Eat More Greens are no longer vegan.
   However, if you go to one of Doughnut Plant NYC’s shops, you may be
   able to find a vegan donut.  They seem to only carry 1 or 2
   soymilk-based donuts at a time, but when I visited in July they were
   available!

   They revolve their flavors seasonally, so check their menu before you
   go to see what you can eat.  Underneath each menu item, they list the
   allergens. For example, the Banana Pecan donut that listed currently
   has an allergy disclaimer that says: “※特定原材料：小麦 、大豆、バナナ”.  No milk!
   Keep an eye out for 乳 (milk) and 卵 (egg) in the allergen section. If
   neither is listed, it’s probably vegan!

   When I visited their Shinjuku Location (just inside the Kabukicho Exit
   of Shinjuku Station, up a short flight of stairs), they had a vegan
   Pistachio Donut.  I asked when I ordered if it contained honey, and the
   lovely sales person checked the ingredients for me – no honey!  I was
   ecstatic after my failure at La Terre, and happily devoured it.

   I’ve had vegan cake donuts at Whole Foods and Pepple’s Donuts in San
   Francisco, but this was my first time in years I’d gotten to try
   bakery-style fluffy donuts (the only other place I’ve seen them is
   Voodoo Donuts in Portland).  Sadly, it wasn’t jaw-droppingly incredible
   – I would have preferred more glaze – but it was still pretty good and
   satisfied my donut craving.

   3. Mana Burger’s “Mana Malasada” ( ¥330 each) – VEGAN!

   Mana Burger is a Hawaiian fast food restaurant located in Tama-Plaza,
   Kanagawa. It’s not technically in Tokyo, but it’s close enough to make
   the list (just 24 minutes from Shibuya Station).  When I visited here I
   wasn’t expecting to find donuts, but when I saw them on the menu I knew
   I had to have one!  I’d never had a Malasada before, so I was really
   excited to try it.  And I can now safely say that the Malasada is quite
   possibly my favorite cinnamon-rolled member of the international donut
   family.  It was increeeedible!  Definitely not to be missed!
   Mana Malasada - ¥330

   Mana Malasada – ¥330

   4. Pure Cafe’s “Homemade Cream Donuts” (¥420 each) – VEGAN!

   Sadly, there is one Tokyo donut that I desperately wanted but failed to
   obtain – Pure Cafe’s absurdly deliciously-looking cream-filled donuts.
    They seem to release them only in the morning and only on certain days
   of the week (last I saw it was Wednesdays), and since I had to work
   Wednesday morning, I never made it there in time for one.  Seriously,
   though, look at these things (photos from the Pure Cafe Facebook).  How
   could they NOT be amazing?

   So, in conclusion, while my quest to eat A vegan donut in Tokyo was
   achieved, I didn’t get to eat allthedonuts, which as you might expect
   is a pretty bitter disappointment.  I hope you readers succeed where I
   failed!  Good luck!

   Note: Found another tasty vegan donut in Tokyo?  Let me know!
