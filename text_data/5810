How it works

On-line Access to UN Documents simplified: undocs.org + symbol = doc

   To access an official UN document, simply select the new Quick Link URL
   – undocs.org.

   Documents are arranged according to official UN symbols. General
   Assembly documents, for example, are assigned the unique symbol ‘A’,
   and are further identified by session and document number. Hence,
   typing in undocs.org/A/65/537 in a web browser will allow you to bypass
   additional Official Document System related search steps and will
   result in immediate access to the specific GA document.

   Similarly, Security Council documents are assigned the unique symbol
   ‘S’. To find a particular Security Council Resolution, you would only
   need to type in undocs.org/S/RES/1969(2011). For more information on UN
   Document Symbols, please refer to the Research Guide to United Nations
   Document Symbols.
