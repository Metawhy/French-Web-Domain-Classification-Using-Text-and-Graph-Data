   

Targeted quantification

   Targeted strategies have emerged ten years ago and are best suited when
   precise, ideally absolute, quantification of finite sets of proteins
   are required with highest sensitivity.

Post-translational modifications: detection and quantification

   Proteins are very often the subject of various post-translational
   modifications (PTMs) that can impact their association with other
   proteins and globally other biomolecules, their subcellular
   localization and their stability.

   Functional analysis and interpretation of proteomic data with ProteoRE
   (10 & 11/07/2019)

Functional analysis and interpretation of proteomic data with ProteoRE (10 &
11/07/2019)

   ProteoRE (Proteomics Research Environment) is a Galaxy-based platform
   for the functional analysis and the exploration of proteomics (and
   transcriptomics) data in biomedical research; it allows researchers to
   apply a large range of dedicated bioinformatics tools and data analysis
   workflows on their data, share their analyses with others, and enable
   tiers to repeat the same analysis while keeping tracks of the overall
   process. Currently, ProteoRE comprises 18 tools organized into five
   subsections for: i) data manipulation; ii) human and iii ) mouse
   species database annotation; iv) functional analysis; and v) pathway
   analysis along with graphical representations.
