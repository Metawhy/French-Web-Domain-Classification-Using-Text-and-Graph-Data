What is the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA)?

   To strengthen the security of travel to the United States under the
   Visa Waiver Program, requirements to travel visa-free have been
   enhanced. Nationals of Visa Waiver Program countries will still be
   eligible to travel without a visa but will have to obtain an approved
   travel authorization prior to their travel to the United States.

   The Department of Homeland Security and the United States Customs and
   Border Protection have provided a secure public Web site with an
   automated form for you, or a third party, to complete in order to apply
   for a travel authorization. Once you enter the required biographic,
   travel, and payment information on the secure Web site, your
   application is processed by the system to determine if you are eligible
   to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program without a
   visa. The system will provide you with an automated response, and prior
   to boarding, a carrier will electronically verify with the United
   States Customs and Border Protection that you have an approved travel
   authorization on file.

   The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) is an automated
   system used to determine the eligibility of visitors to travel to the
   United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and whether such
   travel poses any law enforcement or security risk.

   ESTA approval authorizes a traveler to board a carrier for travel to
   the United States under the VWP. Private carriers must be a signatory
   visa waiver program carrier. See list of Signatory Carriers. CBP
   recommends that you apply for ESTA at the time you book your travel,
   but no less than 72 hours prior to boarding.

   ESTA is not a visa. It does not meet the legal requirements to serve in
   lieu of a U.S. visa when a visa is required. Travelers that possess a
   valid U.S. visa may travel to the United States on that visa for the
   purpose it was issued. Travelers traveling on valid visas are not
   required to apply for an ESTA. In the same way that a valid visa does
   not guarantee admission to the United States, an approved ESTA is not a
   guarantee of admission to the United States.

   ESTA became mandatory January 12, 2009. VWP applicants are required to
   complete a blue Customs declaration upon arrival in the U.S. whether or
   not they have an ESTA authorization. VWP travelers are no longer
   required to complete the green I-94W card.

   Approved ESTA applications are valid for a period of two years, or
   until the passport expires, whichever comes first, and multiple trips
   to the United States without the traveler having to re-apply for
   another ESTA. When traveling to the U.S. with the approved ESTA, you
   may only stay for up to 90 days at a time - and there should be a
   reasonable amount of time between visits so that the CBP Officer does
   not think you are trying to live here. There is no set requirement for
   how long you must wait between visits.

   Travelers whose ESTA applications are approved, but whose passports
   will expire in less than two years, will receive an ESTA valid until
   the passport's expiration date.

   A new ESTA authorization is required if:
     * You are issued a new passport,
     * You change your name (first and/or last)
     * You change your gender (ESTA does not currently have a gender X to
       choose from on the application. It is suggested that the traveler
       choose whichever choice they feel most comfortable with. ESTA will
       not be denied solely on the gender chosen on the application.)
     * Your country of citizenship changes
     * Your circumstances change, e.g., you are convicted of a crime of
       moral turpitude or you develop a contagious disease. Such a change
       may require you to get a visa to travel to the U.S. You must
       re-apply and your application must reflect the change in your
       circumstances or you may be denied entry upon arrival in the United
       States. More information about other ineligibilities can be found
       on the U.S. State Department website

   DHS recommends that you apply for ESTA authorization as soon as you
   know you will be traveling to the United States under the VWP. If your
   ESTA expires while in the U.S., it will not affect your departure.

   Beginning September 8, 2010, there is a fee required by the Travel
   Promotion Act of 2009 (Section 9 of the United States Capitol Police
   Administrative Technical Corrections Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-145).
   The fee is comprised of two parts:
     * Processing Charge -- All applicants requesting an electronic travel
       authorization are charged for the processing of the application.
       The fee is US $4.00.
     * Authorization charge -- If your application is approved and you
       receive authorization to travel to the United States under the Visa
       Waiver Program, an additional US $10.00 will be added to your
       payment method. If your electronic travel authorization is denied,
       you are only charged for the processing of your application.

   CBP is not responsible for any third party fees for the transaction.

   Note: It is important to PRINT a copy of the document for your records.
   The printout is not required upon arrival into the United States, as
   the officers have the information electronically.

What is the difference between an ESTA and a visa?

   An approved travel authorization is not a visa. It does not meet the
   legal or regulatory requirements to serve in lieu of a United States
   visa when a visa is required under United States law. Individuals who
   possess a valid visa will still be able to travel to the United States
   on that visa for the purpose for which it was issued. Individuals
   traveling on valid visas are not required to apply for a travel
   authorization.

Why do I need to fill out an ESTA application?

   The "Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007"
   (9/11 Act) amended Section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act
   (INA), requiring that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   implement an electronic travel authorization system and other measures
   to enhance the security of the Visa Waiver Program. ESTA adds another
   layer of security that allows DHS to determine, in advance of travel,
   whether an individual is eligible to travel to the United States under
   the Visa Waiver Program and whether such travel poses a law enforcement
   or security risk.

How long does the ESTA application process take?

   The estimated average time to complete this application is 20 minutes.

Is my information secure?

   Yes. This Web site is operated by the United States Government and
   employs technology to prevent unauthorized access to the information
   you enter and view. Additionally, this Web site operates under the
   rules and regulations as specified by the United States Privacy Act and
   this Privacy Statement to insure the privacy of your information.

How long is my information stored?

   ESTA application data remains active for the period of time that the
   approved ESTA is valid, which is generally two years, or until the
   traveler's passport expires, whichever comes first. DHS will then
   maintain this information for an additional year after which it will be
   archived for twelve years to allow retrieval of the information for law
   enforcement, national security, or investigatory purposes. Once the
   information is archived, the number of officials with access to it will
   be further limited. This retention is consistent both with CBP's border
   search authority and with the border security mission mandated for CBP
   by Congress. Data linked to active law enforcement lookout records, CBP
   matches to enforcement activities, and/or investigations or cases,
   including applications for ESTA that are denied, will remain accessible
   for the life of the law enforcement activities to which they are
   related.

   As DHS transitions to a paperless I-94W, the ESTA application data will
   replace the data that is collected through the paper I-94W. In those
   instances where ESTA application data is used in lieu of the
   information collected through the paper I-94W, the ESTA application
   data will be maintained in accordance with the retention schedule for
   the I-94W, 75 years.

   for a travel authorization. Once you enter the required biographic,
   travel, and payment information on the secure Web site, your
   application is processed by the system to determine if you are eligible
   to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program without a
   visa. The system will provide you with an automated response, and prior
   to boarding, a carrier will electronically verify with the United
   States Customs and Border Protection that you have an approved travel
   authorization on file.

   The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) is an automated
   system used to determine the eligibility of visitors to travel to the
   United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and whether such
   travel poses any law enforcement or security risk.

   ESTA approval authorizes a traveler to board a carrier for travel to
   the United States under the VWP. Private carriers must be a signatory
   visa waiver program carrier. See list of Signatory Carriers. CBP
   recommends that you apply for ESTA at the time you book your travel,
   but no less than 72 hours prior to boarding.

   ESTA is not a visa. It does not meet the legal requirements to serve in
   lieu of a U.S. visa when a visa is required. Travelers that possess a
   valid U.S. visa may travel to the United States on that visa for the
   purpose it was issued. Travelers traveling on valid visas are not
   required to apply for an ESTA. In the same way that a valid visa does
   not guarantee admission to the United States, an approved ESTA is not a
   guarantee of admission to the United States.

   ESTA became mandatory January 12, 2009. VWP applicants are required to
   complete a blue Customs declaration upon arrival in the U.S. whether or
   not they have an ESTA authorization. VWP travelers are no longer
   required to complete the green I-94W card.

   Approved ESTA applications are valid for a period of two years, or
   until the passport expires, whichever comes first, and multiple trips
   to the United States without the traveler having to re-apply for
   another ESTA. When traveling to the U.S. with the approved ESTA, you
   may only stay for up to 90 days at a time - and there should be a
   reasonable amount of time between visits so that the CBP Officer does
   not think you are trying to live here. There is no set requirement for
   how long you must wait between visits.

   Travelers whose ESTA applications are approved, but whose passports
   will expire in less than two years, will receive an ESTA valid until
   the passport's expiration date.

   A new ESTA authorization is required if:
     * You are issued a new passport,
     * You change your name (first and/or last)
     * You change your gender (ESTA does not currently have a gender X to
       choose from on the application. It is suggested that the traveler
       choose whichever choice they feel most comfortable with. ESTA will
       not be denied solely on the gender chosen on the application.)
     * Your country of citizenship changes
     * Your circumstances change, e.g., you are convicted of a crime of
       moral turpitude or you develop a contagious disease. Such a change
       may require you to get a visa to travel to the U.S. You must
       re-apply and your application must reflect the change in your
       circumstances or you may be denied entry upon arrival in the United
       States. More information about other ineligibilities can be found
       on the U.S. State Department website

   DHS recommends that you apply for ESTA authorization as soon as you
   know you will be traveling to the United States under the VWP. If your
   ESTA expires while in the U.S., it will not affect your departure.

   Beginning September 8, 2010, there is a fee required by the Travel
   Promotion Act of 2009 (Section 9 of the United States Capitol Police
   Administrative Technical Corrections Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-145).
   The fee is comprised of two parts:
     * Processing Charge -- All applicants requesting an electronic travel
       authorization are charged for the processing of the application.
       The fee is US $4.00.
     * Authorization charge -- If your application is approved and you
       receive authorization to travel to the United States under the Visa
       Waiver Program, an additional US $10.00 will be added to your
       payment method. If your electronic travel authorization is denied,
       you are only charged for the processing of your application.

   CBP is not responsible for any third party fees for the transaction.

   Note: It is important to PRINT a copy of the document for your records.
   The printout is not required upon arrival into the United States, as
   the officers have the information electronically.

What is the difference between an ESTA and a visa?

   An approved travel authorization is not a visa. It does not meet the
   legal or regulatory requirements to serve in lieu of a United States
   visa when a visa is required under United States law. Individuals who
   possess a valid visa will still be able to travel to the United States
   on that visa for the purpose for which it was issued. Individuals
   traveling on valid visas are not required to apply for a travel
   authorization.

Why do I need to fill out an ESTA application?

   The "Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007"
   (9/11 Act) amended Section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act
   (INA), requiring that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   implement an electronic travel authorization system and other measures
   to enhance the security of the Visa Waiver Program. ESTA adds another
   layer of security that allows DHS to determine, in advance of travel,
   whether an individual is eligible to travel to the United States under
   the Visa Waiver Program and whether such travel poses a law enforcement
   or security risk.

How long does the ESTA application process take?

   The estimated average time to complete this application is 20 minutes.

Is my information secure?

   Yes. This Web site is operated by the United States Government and
   employs technology to prevent unauthorized access to the information
   you enter and view. Additionally, this Web site operates under the
   rules and regulations as specified by the United States Privacy Act and
   this Privacy Statement to insure the privacy of your information.

How long is my information stored?

   ESTA application data remains active for the period of time that the
   approved ESTA is valid, which is generally two years, or until the
   traveler's passport expires, whichever comes first. DHS will then
   maintain this information for an additional year after which it will be
   archived for twelve years to allow retrieval of the information for law
   enforcement, national security, or investigatory purposes. Once the
   information is archived, the number of officials with access to it will
   be further limited. This retention is consistent both with CBP's border
   search authority and with the border security mission mandated for CBP
   by Congress. Data linked to active law enforcement lookout records, CBP
   matches to enforcement activities, and/or investigations or cases,
   including applications for ESTA that are denied, will remain accessible
   for the life of the law enforcement activities to which they are
   related.

   As DHS transitions to a paperless I-94W, the ESTA application data will
   replace the data that is collected through the paper I-94W. In those
   instances where ESTA application data is used in lieu of the
   information collected through the paper I-94W, the ESTA application
   data will be maintained in accordance with the retention schedule for
   the I-94W, 75 years.
