Analysis

Africa must move away from the death penalty

   Last week, Amnesty International published its report on the global use
   of the death penalty for 2016. The report indicates that at least 1 032
   people were executed in 23 countries. Excluding China, which executed
   more people than the rest of the world combined, 87% of all executions
   took place in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Pakistan.

   In recent years, sub-Saharan Africa has stood out as a beacon of hope
   and positive progress on the abolition of the death penalty.
   However, 2016 saw a mix of good and bad news.

   The good news is that there has been a significant reduction in the
   number of executions carried out in the region. The number of recorded
   executions went down by about 49%, with 22 executions recorded in 2016
   compared to 43 in the previous year.

   In addition two countries in the region abolished the death penalty. In
   January 2016 the Constitutional Court of Benin ruled that, in order to
   comply with the country’s international human rights obligations, all
   laws providing for the death penalty were void and death sentences
   could no longer be imposed in the country. The landmark decision
   effectively abolished the death penalty in the country.

   Later in the year Guinea introduced a new Criminal Code which removed
   the death penalty as an applicable punishment for ordinary crimes.
   While Guinea’s Military Code still provides for the death penalty for
   exceptional crimes, a bill to remove all death penalty provisions from
   the Military Code is pending in the country’s National Assembly.

   These positive developments in Benin and Guinea followed the trend from
   2015 when Madagascar and the Republic of Congo consigned the death
   penalty to history. The pace of abolition in sub-Saharan Africa has
   been steady and promising. In 1977, when Amnesty International started
   campaigning and advocating for the worldwide abolition of the death
   penalty, no country in sub-Saharan Africa had abolished the death
   penalty for all crimes; today 19 have.

   There was also good news for hundreds of people in the region who had
   been condemned to death and were reprieved in 2016 when death sentences
   were commuted in Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Mauritania and Sudan. The
   commutations in Kenya were particularly remarkable as president Uhuru
   Kenyatta commuted the death sentences of 2 747 prisoners – the entire
   death row population in Kenya at the time. Kenya has not carried out
   executions in 30 years and this move further steers it away from the
   death penalty.

   On the other hand, two countries that had not carried out executions
   since 2013 resumed. Botswana executed one person in 2016; and in
   December three people were suddenly executed in Edo state of Nigeria.

   A very worrying trend in sub-Saharan Africa last year was the sharp
   increase in the number of death sentences handed down, despite the fact
   that the number of countries where death sentences were imposed by the
   courts fell from 21 in 2015 to 17 in 2016. There was a staggering 145%
   increase in the number of death sentences imposed across the region;
   1 086 death sentences were confirmed in 2016 compared to 443 in 2015.
   This sharp increase was largely due to a massive surge in Nigeria where
   the courts imposed a total of 527 death sentences, the highest in
   Africa. This high number of death sentences in Nigeria raises serious
   concerns about the real possibility of executing the innocent, as
   unsafe convictions are common. In fact the courts in the country
   exonerated 32 wrongly convicted people in 2016 alone.

   The death penalty is a violation of the right to life; it is the
   ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment that has no place in the modern
   era. The majority of the countries in the world, a total of 104, have
   accepted this fact by completely doing away with it for all crimes. It
   is time for sub-Saharan African countries that are yet to do so to join
   them. There is no reason why in the foreseeable future the region could
   not be completely free of the death penalty.
