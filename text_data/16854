   Brock Lesnar assaults Kofi Kingston after The New Day's victory:
   SmackDown LIVE, Sept. 17, 2019

   After Kofi Kingston secures the win for The New Day, Brock Lesnar
   emerges to deliver a brutal message to the WWE Champion.

   Friday Night SmackDown on FOX is set to debut in a BIG way.

   Kofi Kingston is adamant on being a fighting champion, but Brock Lesnar
   is determined to make the WWE Champion regret that mindset.  After The
   New Day secured a Six-Man Tag Team Match victory over Randy Orton & The
   Revival, The Beast Incarnate returned to deliver Kingston a challenge
   and then a brutal F-5.

   The WWE Championship will be on the line when Friday Night
   SmackDown heads to FOX as an all-new rivalry emerges.

   Can Kingston slay The Beast and retain his title, or will Lesnar usher
   in a whole new era of Friday Night SmackDown?

   Tune in Oct. 4, for the epic Friday Night SmackDown premiere on FOX at
   8/7 C!

   Kevin Owens challenges Shane McMahon to a Ladder Match: SmackDown LIVE,
   Sept. 24, 2019

   As Kevin Owens and Shane McMahon discuss KO’s lawsuit, the former
   Universal Champion suggests a Ladder Match resolution on the FOX debut
   of Friday Night SmackDown.

   Kevin Owens hasn’t been able to escape the ire of Shane McMahon during
   his SmackDown tenure, and it’s continuously put his WWE career in
   jeopardy.

   As a last resort, Owens threatened Shane-O-Mac with a massive lawsuit
   and set out to hit him where it hurts most: the wallet. Presented with
   the possibility of an ongoing court battle, KO offered McMahon an
   alternative settlement for their dispute.

   The rivals agreed to put their careers on the line in a Ladder Match on
   the FOX Friday Night SmackDown premiere with the loser fired from WWE.
   Signed documents from both competitors agreeing to the stipulations
   will be placed in a briefcase hanging above the ring. The first to
   climb the ladder and retrieve the briefcase will win the right to
   terminate the other's WWE employment.

   Will Owens get the chance to hand “The Best in the World” his walking
   papers, or will McMahon get rid of his most insubordinate employee once
   and for all?
