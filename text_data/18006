About Jobsinnetwork

   With over 100 job boards across Europe, Asia, Latin America and the US,
   the Jobsin Network has grown exponentially over the past 10 years.
   Since its inception, the network has filled a niche sorely missing: a
   single, easy-to-use online job portal for recruiters looking to fill in
   positions for which English is the main working language, where only
   very high calibre professionals are suitably qualified.

About Jobsinnetwork

   With over 100 job boards across Europe, Asia, Latin America and the US,
   the Jobsin Network has grown exponentially over the past 10 years.
   Since its inception, the network has filled a niche sorely missing: a
   single, easy-to-use online job portal for recruiters looking to fill in
   positions for which English is the main working language, where only
   very high calibre professionals are suitably qualified.
