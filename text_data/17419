Adopt the Flock

   For a gift of $150, you can sponsor the whole flock — Gerda, Perdita,
   Spunky, Ruthie, and Bowie — and have adoption certificates sent to
   family and friends!
   Celebrate turkeys as friends, not food. Sponsor a rescued turkey at
   Farm Sanctuary.

Adoptable Turkeys

   Since 1986, Farm Sanctuary’s annual Adopt a Turkey Project has led to
   the rescue of more than one thousand turkeys from a brutal death and
   given thousands of people an opportunity to honor the spirit of the
   holiday by helping animals in need. Do your part by sponsoring one of
   the following rescued turkeys at Farm Sanctuary!
   Gerda

   Gerda is one of 24 turkeys saved by an anonymous rescuer and brought to
   Farm Sanctuary. Since they were debeaked, a common industry practice,
   these turkeys most likely started life on a factory farm. They were
   weak and ill upon arrival, but these days, Gerda lets everyone know
   who’s boss!
   Adopt Gerda
   Perdita

   In helping animals like Perdita, compassion truly begins on our plates.
   Raised on a factory farm, Perdita would have been among the 240 million
   turkeys slaughtered for meat in the U.S. each year. Thankfully, she was
   able to come to Farm Sanctuary, where she has quite the appetite for
   life!
   Adopt Perdita
   Spunky

   Spunky’s guardian rescued her from becoming a Thanksgiving meal, hoping
   to provide a better life for her. Unfortunately, the woman was
   unequipped to care for turkeys, and we stepped in to make sure Spunky
   was able to get the medical attention she needed. At Farm Sanctuary,
   she rules the roost!
   Adopt Spunky
   Ruthie

   Ruthie’s former “owner” thought she was purchasing chicks for her
   backyard-hen flock; as Ruthie grew, though, the woman realized she was
   actually a turkey! Since she was unequipped to care for turkeys,
   however, Ruthie couldn’t stay. So she contacted Farm Sanctuary, where
   Ruthie now enjoys the happy life she deserves!
   Adopt Ruthie
   Bowie

   Bowie is a confident, assertive leader who loves to strut proudly in
   front of his rooster fans and enjoys chatting with the turkeys who live
   next door. He was surrendered by his former guardian and is now the
   star of his flock at Farm Sanctuary!
   Adopt Bowie
   a Flock!

   Adopt a Flock! At Farm Sanctuary, Gerda, Perdita, Spunky, Ruthie,
   Bowie, and their friends live in peace and receive all the love,
   kindness, and individualized care they need.
   Adopt a Flock!

Adoption Information

   More than 46 million turkeys are eaten each Thanksgiving – and if you
   love turkeys as much as we do, you know that’s nothing to be thankful
   for. For just $35, you can sponsor a turkey who lives at Farm
   Sanctuary. Or sponsor the whole flock and have adoption certificates
   sent to family and friends for $150!

   Each Farm Sanctuary Adopt a Turkey sponsorship arrives with:
     * a special Adopt a Turkey certificate* with a color photo of and fun
       details about your new friend;
     * a one-year subscription to Sanctuary, Farm Sanctuary’s biannual
       print magazine; and
     * our deepest thanks for contributing funds for the care of the
       rescued animals at our sanctuaries, and our efforts to educate and
       advocate for turkeys and other farm animals.

   Please join us in making this Thanksgiving a compassionate one for ALL.

   *Please note deadlines to receive certificates before Thanksgiving:
   Print: November 13
   Digital: November 21
