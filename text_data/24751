Welcome to IEEE Communication Theory Workshop 2019

   The winners of the data bakeoff competitions have been announced.

   Welcome to the 2019 IEEE Communication Theory Workshop (IEEE CTW 2019).
   The workshop will be held on May 26 – 29, 2019,  at Hotel Selfoss, in
   Selfoss, Iceland, situated in the middle of Iceland’s captivating
   nature.

   The continued success of this workshop lies in its informal and highly
   interactive atmosphere, in contrast to more formal conferences. As
   always, the workshop will be single track with technical sessions,
   plenary speakers, panel discussions, and a hot-topics submitted poster
   session. The technical sessions will consist of invited lectures given
   by leaders in both academia and industry.

   making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe The capital and
   largest city is Reykjavík, with Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in
   the southwest of the country being home to over two-thirds of the
   population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The
   interior consists of a plateau characterized by sand and lava
   fields, mountains, and glaciers, and many glacial rivers flow to the
   sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has
   a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic
   Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly,
   with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. Official language
   and national language is Icelandic and  the currency is the Icelandic
   króna (ISK). Calling code is +354.
