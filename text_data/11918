For zero-deployment via GitLab Piplines - What kind of unix User?

   Ask Question
   Asked today

   I want to implement a zero-deployment strategy for my websever.

   My first attempt was to create a specific user (deployer) for that:
# Create user deployer
sudo adduser deployer
# Give the read-write-execute permissions to deployer user for directory /var/ww
w
sudo setfacl -R -m u:deployer:rwx /var/www

   With GitLab and some tutorials like this or this, I try to automate the
   process of deployment.

   However, I got stuck because my user deployer needs sudo rights to fire
   some specific commands.

   Now, I wonder can this be an issue? Because I give gitlab the private
   ssh key to the user deployer, so gitlab can connect to the server.

   Because theoretically gitlab can be hacked and therefore my sever as
   well.

   What do you think? Or is the risk so small so I don't need to worry.

The basics

   Yes, if you store access credentials for your server in Gitlab, and
   Gitlab gets hacked, then your server may get hacked. If the user who is
   deploying your application needs root access, then you have no choice
   but to give root access to gitlab (or adjust your application so root
   access isn't necessary).

User access level

   You seem to be specifically concerned about giving Gitlab root access
   to your server. While that certainly should be avoided if possible,
   this isn't necessarily the largest concern. After all, if the only
   thing your server does is host your application, then someone who
   breaks in as the deployer user already has access to everything of
   interest. At that point in time making the user root as well doesn't
   really make it that much more dangerous.

The next step

   In an ideal world it wouldn't be a question of "servers" anyway. For
   instance, if you are running on a dedicated server somewhere then
   having root get compromised can certainly be a pain. However, if you go
   a step farther along and are having a VPS or a Kubernetes cluster
   provisioned from (say) a Docker image, then having any one "server"
   compromised is less of a hassle. You simply fix up the root issue that
   caused the compromise and re-deploy on brand new "servers". Obviously
   breaches are always bad and I'm not trying to say otherwise, but my
   point is that in well run infrastructure there can be much less concern
   about "servers", which is a good thing.

Should you put access keys in Gitlab?

   Whether or not the risk of having your Gitlab account compromised is
   something you should worry about is a question that only you can
   answer. Here's the question you need to ask yourself: "Is the benefit
   of automating my deployments worth the additional risk of my server
   being compromised?"

   This is effectively a simple risk assessment. Of course to answer that
   you need to know the likelihood of a compromise, which is harder to
   answer. To be clear though, Gitlab itself being hacked is (IMO) less
   likely than security mistakes on your part, i.e.:
    1. Make sure you are using a strong unique password on Gitlab
    2. Enable a secure 2FA account
    3. Make sure you follow best practices regarding storing secrets for
       CI/CD scripts

   Also keep in mind that this is only one of many possible ways a server
   can be compromised. Making sure that your CI/CD pipeline is well
   secured is only one priority, and if at the same time you have an open
   FTP server running on your server, or your application isn't following
   the basics of application security, then you have bigger fish to fry.

   In the end though, only you can decide if this extra automation step is
   worth the increased risks for you.

   I have read a post in thehackernews and searched the net to find how it
   worked.

   How can anyone add javascript in an image such that when the image is
   displayed it can run a script.

   Can this be done with other languages?

   In the article you linked to, the Javascript code is not being included
   inside the image file itself per se, it's manifesting within the HTML
   page that references the image. Untrusted input is being returned
   inside the image tag without sufficient validation or sanitisation.
   This is persistent cross-site scripting since the malicious input is
   being returned every time someone views the page that includes this
   image (i.e. it's probably stored in the database as part of the user's
   profile).

   Conventionally, the HTML markup to include a profile picture might look
   something like this:
<img src="/imagename.jpg">

   However, it has to be different for each user, so the application code
   that generates it might look something like this (example is PHP):
<img src="/<?=$imagename?>">

   So if the user Alice uploaded alicespic.jpg, users would see that image
   when they visited her profile, for example. However, this is where the
   vulnerability can occur, if the image name is not properly validated or
   sanitised.

   For example, if Mallory could set her profile's image name to
   inncoent.jpg" onload="alert(1), the following HTML markup would be
   generated:
 <img src="/inncoent.jpg" onload="alert(1)">

   Utilising the onload event means that the arbitrary script will be
   executed once the image has finished loading. Essentially, this
   Javascript code will be executed every time someone views the affected
   profile, but it will run inside their browser.

   This would not occur if the developer only allowed safe characters to
   be included inside the image name.

   There are 2 ways you can do this, the first is simply writing a script
   in a text file and saving it as a jpg. This is obviously not an image,
   but it will work. If you want a real image, you can take your image and
   use a hexeditor to add your script to the image metadata. This works
   because the browsers interpret the code as they try to render the image
   into the HTML.

   Images use a header called EXIF that contains information about the
   image such as camera model, resolution, flash, etc, You can insert a
   script into this header and if the application is displaying the image
   metadata it will display the script instead. Check this link for more
   information, it is injecting PHP code instead of javascript but the
   idea is the same.

       answer itself is very clear (I wanted to downvote) until you read

       of the comment details to the answer. – David Houde Apr 6 '14 at

   Edit: itscooper's answer is the correct interpretation of the
   vulnerability in the THN article that the question linked to, in my
   opinion. The answer below is for the general question of how to hide js
   and have it be executed inside an image object.

   Historically, you could XSS some browsers by inserting "javascript:"
   URLs as image sources, because they would automatically run the script
   (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet#Image_X
   SS_using_the_JavaScript_directive). Surprisingly, this is still the
   case in Firefox although the javascript is sandboxed and has no access
   to the page objects. Still, it can be used to DOS page loads by running
   an unterminated loop that freezes the main thread. I've reported this
   bug to Mozilla but it has yet to be fixed:
   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924252.

     * your answer satisfies the question but viewing from the websites
       perspective they had only allowed the user to upload a image which
       contains only the name of the image. no tags nothing else . so how
       can anyone embed a code in an image to cause xss – user38257 Apr 6
       '14 at 12:05
     * @user38257 You're right, I was answering the general question and
       not specifically talking about the THN article. itscooper's answer
       is basically what I would have said. – Yan Z Apr 6 '14 at 12:10

   I am looking into insights on how to detect an ongoing execution of
   Malware and prevent further execution of it. How does AV programs do
   that programatically? I am trying to find resources online, but have no
   luck, so I fallback to the community for any hints on where to start.

   I understand there are some procedured to hook yourself on some Windows
   API to intercept certain API calls.. but haven't seen any POC or Demo
   code anywhere.

     * "malware" is a category of software and is defined by "unwanted
       behaviour". First, you need to define what behaviour is unwanted.
       Else, you have preidentified unusual behaviour characteristics and
       observe and block those. Once you have that, then you can design a
       way to block that behavior. – schroeder♦ 12 mins ago

Alternative to using Refresh Tokens?

   I've been learning about OAuth2, JWT tokens, and refresh tokens.

   My understanding of this is:
    1. A user logs in using their credentials.
    2. They are given back an access token (short-lived) and a refresh
       token (long-lived).
    3. Any requests to API resources uses the access token.
    4. When the access token expires, the refresh token is used to get
       another one. This avoids the need for the user to re-enter their
       credentials, while at the same time giving a mechanism to revoke
       access.
    5. Because of the way it is signed, the access token (JWT) is
       tamper-proof and can include any claims. Typically tokens are all
       signed with the same key regardless of the user, which means that
       you can't boot a compromised user based on access token alone
       without changing the key and kicking out everyone else.

   Given all this, is there anything wrong with simplifying the process as
   follows?
    1. Store an access token for each user in the database, along with a
       key used for signing (per user).
    2. When the client sends a token to the server, it includes a header
       (or similar) with the user id (or a representation of it). This is
       so that the server can identify the user without decrypting the
       token first.
    3. The server fetches the key for that user (using the provided id)
       and decrypts the token with it. If the user id from step 2 has been
       tampered with, token decryption will fail.
    4. When an access token is compromised, it can be deleted entirely or
       its related secret changed.
    5. Access tokens can thus be long-lived and there is no need for
       refresh tokens.

   The added effort to store these access tokens in the database is about
   the same as for storing refresh tokens. The benefit is that the flow is
   simplified to one authorization mechanism rather than two.

   Storing a whitelist of access tokens in a database is a great way to
   perform access token revocation; if it's not in the DB, don't accept
   the token. However, this undermines one of the main advantages of JWTs:
   being able to verify tokens without having to access to a centralised
   DB. Usually, the short lifespan of access tokens is considered a good
   enough safeguard to make revocation of access tokens unnecessary.
   Refresh tokens can be revoked though (by disallowing a particular user
   from generating more access tokens).

   Storing a unique key pair per user is not a great idea. They use much
   more storage than tokens and therefore take longer to read and write,
   and are time-consuming and CPU-intensive to generate. It also achieves
   little in the way of security.

   Frequent key rotation is a better idea. Multiple signing keys can be in
   use simultaneously, with the key identified by either the 'kid' or
   'x5t' claim in the JWT header.
