   Call for Submissions

   The 16th IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network and Service
   Management (IM 2019) will be held April 8-12 2019 in Washington DC,
   USA. Held in odd-numbered years since 1989, IM 2019 carries forward the
   30+ years’ tradition of NOMS and IM as the primary IEEE Communications
   Society’s forum for technical exchange on management of information and
   communication technology, focusing on research, development,
   integration, standards, operational experiences, and user communities.

   IM 2019 will focus on the theme “Intelligent Management for the Next
   Wave of Cyber and Social Networks”, reflecting the increasing
   convergence of both technical network infrastructure and infrastructure
   for social interactions as well as the emergence of new waves of
   communications technology involving areas as varied as cyber-physical
   systems, ultra-low latency services, and converged management and
   control planes.  In addition to this theme, IM 2019 will cover a wide
   range of topics of interest within the field in integrated network and
   service management.

   Authors are invited to submit papers that fall into or are related to
   the listed topic areas. In addition, we invite submissions of proposals
   for demonstrations, exhibits, technical panels, tutorials, workshops,
   and application session papers.
