   sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be
   expressed using schema.org terminology.

   Organization  or
   Person  Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing
   the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the
   structured data is derived automatically from existing published
   content but published on a different site. For example, student

   properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are
   not known to be appropriate.
   spatialCoverage
   Place  The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s)
   which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
   contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed
   materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the
   dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have
   spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.
   sponsor
   Organization  or
   Person  A person or organization that supports a thing through a
   pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical
   Study or a corporate sponsor of an event.

   properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified,
   datePublished) are not known to be appropriate.
   temporalCoverage
   DateTime  or
   Text  or
   URL  The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that
   the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or
   as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval
   format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the
   relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census
   dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of
   content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate
   their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known
   URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal
   coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO
   8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".
   Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end
   date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November
   2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be
   updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes
   datasetTimeInterval.

   a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In
   RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof'
   attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker
   understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
   alternateName
   Text  An alias for the item.
   description
   Text  A description of the item.
   disambiguatingDescription
   Text  A sub property of description. A short description of the item
   used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other
   properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description
   to be useful for disambiguation.
   identifier
   PropertyValue  or
   Text  or
   URL  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any
   kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org

   textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more
   details.

   ImageObject  or
   URL  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described
   ImageObject.

   the main entity being described. See background notes for details.

   potentialAction
   Action  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized
   action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.

   item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata
   entry, or official website.
