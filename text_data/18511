Best Gaming PC Build Under $300 of 2019 (Good & Cheap)

   Last updated on October 7, 2019 by Ben Johnson
   Best Gaming PC Build under 300
   IOZ TECH prebuilt

   This post recommends the best gaming PC you can build for around $300.
   If you’re looking to buy a pre-made one, we recommend the IOZ TECH
   Gaming System. It’s powered by a Ryzen 3 2200g chip and is capable of
   handling AAA title games at low to medium settings.

   View more prebuilt options

   July 2019 Update: We've updated the $300 build to include the latest
   and greatest AMD Ryzen 3 2200G CPU with integrated GPU and revamped the
   upgrade path. As well as this, we have updated all of the prebuilt PC
   options for this budget.

   In the past, many would consider a $300 gaming PC build a futile
   endeavor. With a prebuilt computer, it can be difficult to get
   similar value like you would from building your own.

   There are compelling options available today to build a cheap PC that's
   good enough to be considered 'entry-level' so taking the time to put
   together your own system makes economic sense.

Build Overview

   Here we have our best gaming PC for around $300. We have tried to
   recommend a build that provides the best possible value for you with
   researched components that make upgrading in the future a bit less
   stressful.

   While we’ll talk more about its upgradeability later in the article,
   there’s a lot more you should expect from this build:

Good eSports Performance

   Fortnite, Overwatch, and CS:GO should all perform great with this build
   at Low/Medium settings. While you won’t be blown away by stellar
   graphical performance, you will be able to enjoy acceptable performance
   without needing to upgrade.

AMD APU

   The Ryzen 3 2200G is the centre of this build. This is an APU which
   means it acts as both the CPU and GPU in a traditional PC build. In
   fact, APUs are made just for these sorts of budget builds. The CPU
   performance is on par with that of an Intel i3 chip and the integrated
   GPU performance is on par with that of a GT 1030.

   This offers both an amazing value CPU and entry-level GPU in one. This
   is great because whenever you decide to upgrade your GPU in the future,
   the strong CPU performance means you won’t need to worry about being
   bottlenecked until you go past roughly RX 580 performance levels!

How We Choose the Parts

   Our in-house team work tirelessly to ensure we provide the best
   recommendations possible. We check our PC builds daily to make sure
   they are still in stock and offer the best value for money and are
   constantly searching to provide you the best budget gaming PC for your
   money.

   We are gamers, we are computer enthusiasts, so we understand that
   performance is essential. We use our passion for the industry to make
   sure we provide you with the most up to date recommendations.

   On top of this, we don't just utilize our own knowledge, but use the
   knowledge of others by using various platforms such as Reddit, PC
   forums, industry websites and various Youtube channels to keep us up to
   date with the latest and greatest in PC hardware.

   Please feel comfortable in knowing that you have our support.

Build Details

   This budget-oriented gaming system is designed to be the best 300
   dollar gaming PC money can buy. FPS may not be very high, but this
   system should give you a perfectly enjoyable gaming experience overall,
   especially for eSports titles.

    AMD Ryzen 3 2200G (BUTTON) Check Current Price

   The Ryzen 3 2200G is a solid chip with impressive value and dominates
   this price bracket. With the release of the latest Zen 2 chips from
   AMD, we see the 2200G reduce in price significantly. This price drop
   combined with the fact that the new 3200G barely produces more FPS,
   makes this older-gen CPU a smart choice for a budget build like this.
   The chip features integrated graphics and its performance is on par
   with that of the GT 1030 for about the same price. The CPU even
   competes with the higher-end i3-8100 on its own. This means that once
   you’re able to afford a GPU upgrade, you don’t need to replace your CPU
   at all, making this a beginner gaming PC build that can go further.

       Current Price

   For this build, we opted for Patriot’s Viper 4 Series DDR4 8GB RAM Kit,
   including 2 x 4GB RAM sticks. With AMD APUs, it’s important that you
   don’t skimp out on your RAM. This RAM didn’t come cheap, and it does
   push our budget a little bit, but it is a smart investment and will
   only benefit the PC. We also made sure that we opted for dual-channel
   RAM to ensure that the RAM runs at the intended speed. With a
   fully-fledged 8GB RAM kit at your disposal, you’ll be more than
   equipped to push your APU to its maximum capabilities and achieve the
   desired result in this price range.

   This budget PSU from Seasonic will be more than enough to power this
   setup and should be good enough to support small upgrades in the
   future. Unfortunately, this is a non-modular PSU so the cable
   management is going to be slightly harder when it comes to building
   this rig. In exchange for the inconvenience, you save a decent amount
   of money, which we were able to put toward other parts of this build to
   increase performance. MORE: Best Gaming Power Supplies

   The MSI ProSeries B450M Motherboard is an entry-level motherboard that
   does its job well at this price range. MSI is also a generally reliable
   manufacturer that will help you out if this board happens to arrive
   with any issues out of the box. Additionally, this motherboard also
   ships with support for first and second-gen Ryzen processors as well as
   support for an M2 SSD. The Ryzen 3 2200G is also strong enough on its
   own to power a GPU as strong as the GTX 1060/RX 580, so you don’t even
   need to upgrade your CPU if you don’t want to! MORE: Best Gaming

   The Versa H22 isn’t going to win any awards for style, but this budget
   case actually has quite a lot to offer. Thermaltake has equipped the
   H22 with a pre-installed rear fan for out-the-box cooling. The case
   comes with 4 options to install extra fans, 2 on the front and 2 at the
   top for intake and exhaust. Although this build will never overheat
   this means that you’ll have a fully-fledged airflow solution with only
   1 more fan installed but it isn’t necessary unless you begin to
   upgrade. This model from Thermaltake is a compact case with a sleek and
   refined aesthetic. You can’t ask much more from a budget case offering.
   Finally, it’s just cheap. You aren’t gonna find a better case than this
   at this price range. MORE: Best PC Cases

Why is This The Best for the Price of $300?

   This is the best 300 dollar gaming pc we could put together and it's
   largely because of its value. Thanks to the Ryzen APUs quad-cores, it
   will be even stronger for non-gaming tasks, so common desktop usage and
   multitasking shouldn’t be a problem.

   Another of this build’s core strengths is its upgradeability. Once you
   add in a GPU, like the RX 570 or GTX 1050TI, you’ll have an extremely
   potent gaming machine. Don't forget an extra 4GB of RAM will ensure
   games and multitasking is made easier too. If you start desiring a
   stronger CPU solution, you’re on a modern AMD Ryzen chipset and there’s
   nothing stopping you from swapping in a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 CPU.

   There’s no doubting this is a budget build but thanks to its modern
   chipset and impressive CPU performance it can easily become an amazing
   gaming PC.

What games can this PC run?

   In this section, we’re going to tell you how this game should be able
   to run your favorite games.
     * Fortnite - In Fortnite, this build should be able to achieve 60 FPS
       at 1600x900 and medium settings.
     * PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds - In PUBG, you’ll want to play at
       720p and low/medium settings for acceptable frames. If this is your
       main game of choice, we highly recommend upgrading to the $400 PC
       build.
     * Monster Hunter: World - MHW should be playable at 900p30 with
       medium-high settings with this PC build. Upgrade to the $400 PC
       build if this isn’t enough for you.
     * League of Legends - League of Legends is fairly lightweight, so
       1080p60 won’t be a problem here.
     * Dota 2 -  Same as above.
     * Overwatch - Overwatch is playable at 1080p60 with low/medium
       settings.
     * Rainbow Six: Siege - Siege is actually playable at 1080p60 with low
       settings. The Ryzen cores in this system really carry their weight
       here.
     * Warframe - Warframe should be playable at 1080p and Medium settings
       with this gaming PC build.
     * Grand Theft Auto V - At 720p and low-medium settings, achieving 60
       FPS shouldn’t be a problem at all. In 1080p, however, you’re more
       likely to average in the 40-50 FPS range.
     * Team Fortress 2 - TF2 isn’t particularly graphically-intensive, and
       the Ryzen cores in here are actually pretty good. 1080p60 should be
       achievable with the Ryzen 3 2200G.

Similar Prebuilt Gaming PC Under $300?

   This build, which is possibly the cheapest gaming PC build available
   (and certainly the cheapest viable build) is perfect for those on a
   budget.

   There are gamers who aren’t yet up to speed with building machines or
   maybe have little to no time to do all the research and comparisons of
   components that are required with a beginner gaming PC build.

   Fear not we have you covered!

   Below are several respectable prebuilt PC solutions that are as close
   to the $300 budget we could find but also allow similar levels of
   performance.
     * Custom Gaming Desktop Build
     * Centaurus Druid 2 Gaming Computer

Potential Upgrades

   NOTE: These will raise the price of the build!
   hdd
     * Seagate Barracuda 2TB HDD

Seagate Barracuda 2TB HDD

   This Seagate Barracuda drive is amazing for storage and always comes at
   a great price. The 240GB storage currently in this build is ideal for
   your O/S and some primary games, however, sooner or later it will
   struggle to accommodate your growing library. For that reason, this
   additional 2TB HDD from Seagate is the perfect backup storage solution
   for those who need it.
   ram
     * Patriot Memory VIPER 4 Series

Patriot Memory VIPER 4 Series

   The build features 8GB of fast RAM but for future upgrades, it would be
   in your best interest to add an extra 8GB or swap it out for a 16GB
   kit. 16GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM means that you don’t need to worry
   about RAM issues with your favorite games and applications.
   gpu
     * MSI Gaming Radeon RX 570 256-bit 8GB

MSI Gaming Radeon RX 570 256-bit 8GB

   This build actually uses an APU, meaning it uses an integrated GPU.
   However, you can upgrade the GPU while still utilising the APU as your
   CPU. This is where the MSI RX 570 comes into the picture. With a
   low-profile and quality build, this graphics card represents a huge
   performance boost over the integrated GPU. This allows you power well
   beyond other graphics card around this price. You will benefit from
   improved graphics and FPS across all games with this extremely
   well-priced card. MORE: Best Graphics Cards
   Cooler
     * Noctua NF-F12 Industrial 120mm Fan

Noctua NF-F12 Industrial 120mm Fan

   Due to the lack of an intake fan with the case, we highly recommend you
   buy one of these to use as an intake for your PC. Good airflow will
   ensure optimal performance and a long life for your components!
   Noctua’s NF-F12 fans may be a little expensive, to be fair, but they’re
   also whisper-quiet and great performers in their own right. That’s why
   we recommend them here. MORE: Best Case Fans
   psu
     * Corsair CXM 450W Bronze-Certified Semi-Modular PSU

Corsair CXM 450W Bronze-Certified Semi-Modular PSU

   For an easier building process, buying this semi-modular PSU should
   save you some cable management stress. While this isn’t a strictly
   necessary part of building and will cost you extra, it’s much easier
   than dealing with a fixed, bulky set of cables that come with
   non-modular PSUs.

OS Options and Recommended Peripherals

   Most build articles assume that you have these down on your own, but in
   case you don’t, we have you covered.
   Note: These will raise the price of your build!

Operating System

Windows 10

   Windows 10

   For the best gaming performance and general compatibility, Windows 10
   is your best option. If you already have a retail-bought Windows
   license on another PC, you should be able to transfer over your
   installation with little-to-no issues. If you don’t, however, you may
   need to shell for the cost of a brand new Windows 10 installation. We
   recommend using the Windows 10 USB Flash Drive, this allows you to
   install Windows directly from a Flash Drive, rather than needing a DVD
   drive.

   Note: if you are looking for antivirus software, please take a look at
   our best free antivirus software page.

Linux

   Operating System

   If you can’t afford that, Linux distributions are free and getting
   better all the time. Out of them, we most highly recommend Ubuntu Linux
   and Linux Mint for usability and dev support. Linux, however, will have
   quite the learning curve compared to what you’re used to with Windows.

Mouse and Keyboard

   If you don’t have any basic input devices around, don’t worry. These
   will serve this $300 gaming PC fine.

Roccat KONE Pure SE

   Roccat KONE Pure SE

   For a cheap mouse that meats the needs of a gamer the Roccat Kone Pure
   is a solid choice. This mouse boasts a seriously comfortable shape to

   There are higher end mice available to those that can afford it and
   also several wireless options available to those who wish to cut the

   must-have! This board is under the $50 price range with some impressive
   features packed in! The board features RGB, Macro customisation, clicky
   Blue switches, and a sturdy metal base weighing it to the desk. This is

   No point in shelling out for the $300 build if you’re going to use
   mediocre peripherals, speakers and monitors. Make sure you grab one of
   these if you’re serious about a good gaming experience.

Building Tips

   If this is your first beginner gaming PC build or computer, check our
   12 Mistakes that Every Newbie PC Builder Makes article. This-- along
   with our 15 Common Questions About Building a PC -- should help give
   you an idea of what to watch out for when you’re ready to start placing
   everything together.

Invest In Antistatic Equipment

   Buy an anti-static wristband if you don’t want to risk zapping and
   ruining your shiny new GPU with static discharge (Also, avoid rubbing
   balloons on your head, trust me.). The peace of mind is more than worth
   the extra few dollars (ditto for the balloons thing).

   If you’re not sure how to actually use the thing, then it might also be
   worth checking out our How to Use An Antistatic Wrist Strap guide.

   An anti-static mat can also help by giving you a nice, safe place to
   rest your components when you aren’t holding them.

Watch Building Guides

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4Js2A1qdB8

   While there are many-- and we mean many-- computer building guides on
   Youtube (and the internet at large), Tek Syndicate’s computer building
   guide is our favorite.

   And, as mentioned in the video, you’ll also want to be sure that you
   consult the manuals that come with your hardware during the building
   process.

   Here on our very own website, we have detailed, step-by-step
   instructions on how to build a PC. This includes everything from
   deciding a budget, maintaining your computer long-term.

   Between these three resources, you shouldn’t have a problem putting
   together your first PC!

Install OS Via USB

   First, grab a 4GB USB stick.

   Then, if you’re going to use Windows 10 (which we recommend for
   compatibility if nothing else), use the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool
   and follow the in-program instructions to create a Windows installer
   that can fit in your pocket.

   If you’re wanting to go against the flow, then you might want to look
   into Ubuntu or Linux Mint. If that sounds like your style, then use
   UNetbootin or Rufus instead. This will also walk you through the
   process, but keep in mind that Linux and Ubuntu do not support many of
   the games and software you’re accustomed to using.

Closing Thoughts

   It may have taken a lot of compromises to create a good gaming computer
   at around $300 but In the end, we feel it was certainly worth it. If it
   helped you get into PC gaming when you had previously not had that
   opportunity then that's fantastic!

   By opting for an inexpensive gaming PC instead of a console, you can
   enjoy all the benefits of the PC platform. This includes
   upgradeability, a device that you can use for more than just playing
   games, and, perhaps most importantly, a cheaper overall gaming
   experience.

   PC gamers can also take advantage of platforms like Steam, GOG, and
   Humble Indie Bundle which make downloading and playing games more
   convenient. These platforms aren't locked down to one publisher or
   storefront (like consoles are), so there’s real competition.

            Hi!
            I was wondering if it’s worth getting the 16gb patriot vipers
            instead of the 8gb ones? I found that they’re only a little
            more expensive and it seems like a good upgrade

                 Hi Patrick, great question.
                 It never hurts to have additional RAM when using an APU
                 such as the 2200G in this build.
                 If it’s in the budget Id recommend using it. What is the
                 clock speed of the 16GB you’re looking at?

                 Prices easily rise and fall, Troy. At the moment, I found
                 a way to get it down $320. It’s likely that prices
                 tomorrow or the next day could go even lower than that so
                 I suggest you check with us regularly if you could wait a
                 little more.

            Hi, Troy! How are you? The HP Pavilion Desktop – 570 – P055QE
            has a faster processor compared to what we have in this build.
            But take note, it only has an integrated graphics card. The
            one we have in this build has a GT 1030 graphics card. Playing
            games with this build is without a doubt, better and smoother
            than HP Pavilion Desktop – 570 – P055QE.

            Hello there, Kyle! How are you? I might be able to come up
            with a list of used parts for you if you like including the
            list of other cases that will work. What’s your budget for the
            case?

            Hi Patrick! Thanks for checking us out! Yes, the G4600 will
            definitely work 🙂 However, older motherboards will require a
            BIOS update. But the motherboard included should already come
            with the F20 BIOS update.

       Hi there. I recently completed a build that included a Pentium

       and was curious what part I actually updated? Was it the
       motherboard? And also if I intended to upgrade in the future to
       kaby lake, what would that entail? Thank you

            Hi Michael! Do you mean you have an AB350M-DS3H motherboard?
            If so, this shouldn’t support the G4400 since this motherboard
            is an AM4 socket while the G4400 is an LGA1151 socket.

            play at 720p resolution and on low settings. Also, you’ll want
            to get an 8GB of RAM if you want a smoother gameplay since

            strictly limited around $300? Becuase our $400 build is a
            Ryzen CPU and it also uses an MSI motherboard. But I think
            you’re referring to the Z370 MSI motherboard if I’m not
            mistaken? Also, I just want to confirm if you’re specifically
            referring to the Raidmax Viper (Red)? Once I have these
            confirmed, I could then check if everything’s compatible. 🙂

            integrated iris graphics and 4 gb of ram. It all depends on
            what you expect to run.

            Hi George,
            Since your comment we have tweaked the builds to try and
            extract as soon value as possible out of the budget. As you
            can now see, 8GB of 3000Mhz RAM is the go to for this build.
            Let me know your thoughts :]

            It will run RUST, but you would have to optimize the graphics
            and you would struggle to get anything over 40FPS. but it’s
            playable :]

       Awesome guide! I plan on making this a project over the winter when
       it’s cold and dreary outside.
       I like the specs, but have the money to upgrade to 8 gb of ram and
       stick in an GTX 1050 ti card.
       I’m wondering though if I should go the Intel i3 route or with a
       ryzen 3? I know the i3’s have a slight edge in performance but seem
       to be a bit cheaper.

            Hi Jason, thanks for the question.
            With extra money in the budget, there are a number of
            different paths you can take to try and bolster this build.
            How much extra do you have and whats your main goal? Gaming?

       Pretty bummed, bought this build a week and a half ago or so, as a
       Christmas present, and now we’re trying to build and realize that
       the build didn’t have a motherboard included when I purchased. And
       now a motherboard is out of my budget, so for the time being we are
       left with a useless pile of parts.

       Found your site a couple weeks ago and used the link to buy this

       pieces up and today we started learning how to build a computer!
       Only catch, when I bought it, your bundle didn’t include a
       motherboard, and there isn’t a way for us to afford one right now.
       I’m pretty bummed about it, now we just have a pile of parts….

            The motherboard for this build is listed as the MSI B350M
            PRO-VH-PLUS, located in the parts list second from the bottom,
            above the case and just below the power supply unit. The list
            is located in several spots on this page, see the article and
            the list to the right of this post. If you didn’t get it,
            perhaps it was out of stock or on backorder with the supplier?
            Check, and reorder or source from a different supplier if
            required.

            Did you manage to get a motherboard in the end? Everything you
            need to build this PC can be found in the parts list and
            description. Unfortunately, it sounds like the motherboard may
            of been out of stock which meant you didn’t receive it.
            Please let me know how you got on.

            – Motherboard
            – CPU
            – RAM (Memory)
            – SSD or HDD (storage)
            – PSU (Power Supply Unit)
            – PC Case
            There are optional extras when you increase the budget such
            as:
            – GPU (Graphics Card)
            – Optional heatsink

            Are you referring to the 2400G? If so, then yes you would see
            some performance benefits as the 2400G comes equipped with
            Vega 11 graphics whereas the 2200g only has Vega 8.
            The greatest performance gains that can be achieved – as far
            as an APU is concerned – come from upgrading your RAM.

            Hi Timothy, unfortunately not. The pre-built computers we
            recommend would have Windows OS installed when it is
            delivered. However, for building your own computer, it would
            be necessary to install an operating system yourself, such as
            Windows 10. It is quite a simple process, however we are
            putting a guide together for people who haven’t done this
            before.

            A heatsink comes as standard with the CPU, as does thermal
            paste (pre applied to the stock heatsink). However, for more
            powerful builds and when budget isn’t restricted, we would
            suggest purchasing third party thermal paste and a third party
            heatsink as they can provide significantly better cooling
            which work far more effectively with more powerful CPUs which
            generate more heat, as well as those used for overclocking.

            What graphics are we talking about, and what FPS you would
            like to achieve :]
            A 2400G and 16gb 3200Mhz RAM would certainly bolster this
            build, however.

            However, graphically, you are going to struggle to run OBS and

            decent video.

                      The ASRock B450m is 100% compatible with this build.
                      As far as the RAM goes, you need to first make sure
                      that your MB can accommodate 3000Mhz RAM.
                      If it can, you need to go into your BIOS and select
                      the XMP profile for the higher clocked RAM.

       Hi, I saw this line in the upgrade section under the 2TB HDD. I am
       a complete computer noobie looking to possibly make my first budget
       build from this list of parts. From someone that knows nothing
       about computers, it appears to me that the only storage space
       listed in the build is the 240GB SSD, so I was just wondering about
       that quote saying the initial build has 1TB of space. Is there
       somewhere else that storage soace is coming from? And I realize
       this might have been a silly question to more experienced PC

       Hello Im not a super techy person but I was wondering how adding
       more ram to this build would work. For example could I add 4x 4gb
       ram cards (I bought 1 set already). Would it be okay to do that?
       that way it would total to 16 gb? My budget went up but I dont want
       to return and buy the 8gb set because my location takes 2-3 weeks
       for shipping. Hopefully you understand what Im talking about.

            That would be fine Izaiah. The motherboard has 4RAM slots, so
            adding 4 x 4GB RAM sticks would be perfect. It would also
            increase the performance of the APU exponentially.

                      You don’t really need to tighten your motherboard

       Hi Jana, great question. The 2200G can play these titles but it
       would low FPS only im afraid unless you lower your resolution to
       720p. Upgrading this build to feature the suggested graphics card
       would give you much better graphical performance.

       Im looking into starting a YT channel and hopefully streaming on
       twitch as well. Starting with mobile games but want the option to
       do PC games as well. I don’t currently have a PC. So I need a full
       set up but wasn’t sure if this build would be OK for a budget start
       up.

            Hi, thanks for the comment. It is good to hear you are
            considering getting into the world of PC gaming. While this
            build could handle mobile games no problem it may not be the
            best for streaming or PC gaming. So to protect yourself it
            would be better to save a little more and start with the
            https://www.wepc.com/builds/best-gaming-pc-under-600/ – This
            build will give you better results on your stream with its
            better CPU and can handle PC gaming no problem.

Best Gaming PC Build Under $400 of 2019 (CONSOLE KILLER!!)

   Best Gaming PC Build under 400
   CUK Continuum Micro Gamer PC

   This post recommends the best gaming PC you can build for under $400.
   If you’re looking to buy a pre-made gaming rig in 2019, we recommend
   the CUK Continuum Micro Gaming PC. It’s powered by an an AMD Ryzen
   3200G with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, 16GB DDR4 3000Mhz RAM and a 256GB
   NVME SSD.

   July 2019 Update: We've updated our $400 build with the fantastic AMD
   Ryzen 5 2400G processor with integrated graphics and high-speed RAM.
   While the new generation of Ryzen chips has been released, the older
   ones still offer better price to performance and make sense in a build
   at this price. We've also updated our prebuilt computer
   recommendations, bringing you fantastic value for those who prefer to
   purchase rather than build.

   With the 400 dollar gaming PC our main focus was to give excellent
   value for money whilst still providing a decent level of gaming
   performance. While we aren’t quite at the price range where value is at
   its absolute best, we are getting into the price range where we can
   start making some serious leaps forward into good performance in modern
   games. While this may not be our cheapest gaming PC build, it’s still
   extremely affordable while also functioning as the CONSOLE KILLER PC
   build under $400, as we like to call it.

   We consider this build as being entry-level for both performance
   standards and build difficulty making it the perfect gateway into PC
   building, so let's dive straight in.

Build Overview

   This PC build is comprised of mostly standard hardware components,
   however we have managed to squeeze in one of AMD's latest Ryzen chips
   which when paired with quick RAM is widely considered the best
   pound-for-pound CPU available in its price range. We had three goals to
   meet here which were as follows:

   Making the cheapest gaming PC build that still offers a great value -
   Truth be told, the $300 gaming PC build is a good starting point but
   just that: a starting point.

   This build is the first that keeps great value whilst still having the
   ability to play AAA gaming titles at 1080p.

   Providing console-quality performance - If you’re spending
   console-money, you want console quality. While you may need to make
   settings adjustments here and there, we feel like this build does that
   pretty well. If you pair this with the cheaper Steam game offerings and
   the builds upgrade-ability we believe the $400 build surpasses anything
   a console has to offer.

   Keeping high-quality components - Many budget builds will use no-name
   PSUs and the likes in order to make the price work, but we avoided this
   at all costs and for good reason. Not only is that bad practice, but it
   can actually be dangerous for your system!

   We chose to stick to quality brands that you can trust instead of
   cutting corners, and we think it shows.

   We’ll dive into detail on how we chose the rest of the components
   below. For now, rejoice: this should provide all the performance you
   need for a console-level gaming experience. Factor in Steam sales, and
   you’re getting an even cheaper gaming experience in the long run!

How We Choose the PC Components

   We understand the importance of keeping components in our builds
   up-to-date, that way you can make the most of your budget. For this
   reason, we’re always staying on top of the latest tech news and
   announcements to make sure what we recommend is not only the latest but
   the best for the price.

   We know the ins and outs of hardware performance, price, and
   compatibility. And we’re never afraid to do our due diligence with
   extra research. For instance, we check up-to-date benchmarks from
   multiple sources around the web to confirm the performance of different
   components. We check our builds daily to ensure the hardware we
   recommend is still in stock and the overall build still offers great
   bang for buck. Please rest assured, we are here for you.

Build Details

   Enough of the preambling-- let’s break down each individual component
   in this system and why it was chosen over the other options out there.
   cpu
     * AMD Ryzen 5 2400G Processor
    AMD Ryzen 5 2400G Processor (BUTTON) Check Current Price

   AMD has come a long way in the last couple of years ever since
   releasing their brilliant range of powerful, budget CPU’s. The 2400G
   takes the lead role in this $400 build, with a sharp drop in price
   after the release of the 3rd gen CPUs. Despite being older-gen it comes
   equipped with the same Vega 11 onboard graphics which actually performs
   extremely well if paired with the correct RAM and motherboard. It comes
   with a max boost clock speed of 3.9Ghz which is fantastic at
   multitasking due to its 4cores/8thread’s makeup. It also comes equipped
   with its own cooling system which saves on the money again meaning we
   have more room in the budget to bolster other areas such as RAM.
   Overall one of the best budget CPU’s available.
   ram
     * Corsair LPX Vengeance 3200mhz 16GB RAM
    Corsair LPX Vengeance 3200mhz 16GB RAM (BUTTON) Check Current Price

   Corsair is a trusted brand, and for good reason. This kit of 16GB DDR4
   RAM should offer all the speed and memory capacity that you should need
   for gaming and multitasking and is easily the best pick in this price
   range. Thanks to it being two 8GB sticks, it’ll also run in
   dual-channel, ensuring that the DDR4 RAM is being used to its maximum
   potential and you don’t experience any hitches or problems associated
   with running RAM in single-channel. Further more, the CPU we’ve gone
   for thrives of super quick 3200Mhz memory which gives almost 90%
   performance boost over slower stuff. Despite being a budget product,
   this RAM still has great build quality, so it should last well into the
   foreseeable future.
   ssd
     * Kingston 480GB A400 2.5'' SSD
    Kingston 480GB A400 2.5'' SSD (BUTTON) Check Current Price

   This build utilizes super-fast SSD storage, if you are unfamiliar as to
   how an SSD works, in basic terms the technology within an SSD allows
   for significantly improved loading and boot times compared to the
   traditional HDD. We’ve gone for a trusted brand in Kingston for our SSD
   as it’s one of most trusted consumer-level storage options available.
   Load your Windows and primary games onto the SSD for lightning-quick
   load times.
   psu
     * Seasonic S12 450W 80 Plus Bronze Certified Non-Modular Power Supply
    Seasonic S12 450W 80 Plus Bronze Certified Non-Modular Power Supply
       (BUTTON) Check Current Price

   The best thing you can do when thinking about purchasing a cheap PSU is
   to buy from a reliable manufacturer such as Corsair, Seasonic or EVGA.
   Unless you want a house fire of course. The Seasonic S12 450W Bronze is
   a great starter PSU but isn’t going to win any awards for usability or
   high-end features, but it is going to be solid, stable and reliable for
   years to come, which ultimately is what matters.
   mobo
     * MSI ProSeries B450M PRO-VDH Plus M-ATX Motherboard
    MSI ProSeries B450M PRO-VDH Plus M-ATX Motherboard (BUTTON) Check
       Current Price

   There is really no point in skimping on a motherboard at this stage and
   that’s why we’ve opted for the MSI ProSeries B450M PRO-VDH Plus
   Motherboard here. It guarantees compatibility with the Ryzen 2400G and
   has some great little features as well. It is effectively an
   entry-level motherboard but for $400 it’s as good as you can get. This
   motherboard comes equipped with some cool features, such as its ability
   to overclock both the CPU and the RAM to their full potential. This
   means squeezing additional performance out of the $400 machine is
   certainly an option.
   case
     * Thermaltake Versa H22
    Thermaltake Versa H22 (BUTTON) Check Current Price

   Of all the budget cases we’ve recommended here on WePC, this is
   definitely the most aesthetically pleasing. It also has great
   out-of-the-box cooling, a clean design, great airflow, and plenty of
   room for a long GPU or a few extra hard drives down the line.  The
   Versa H22 is our recommended case for this $400 gaming PC build, but
   there is a small caveat…you’ll likely want to buy at least one (it can
   take four additional fans) extra fan since this case only includes a
   single exhaust fan. To accomplish optimal airflow, you’ll want to add
   an intake fan of your own upfront, two if you’re particularly serious.
   We have some great budget fan options listed in optional upgrades
   below. MORE: Best PC Cases

Why is This The Best Custom PC for the Price of $400?

   Simply put? We’re providing the only up-to-date gaming PC build for
   $400 featuring an AMD 2400G that isn’t linking to unavailable parts,
   isn’t stuffing in dangerous no-name PSUs to save money, and isn’t going
   dramatically over budget to accomplish its goals. In fact, most of the
   time this build will be hovering around the $400 mark unlike other PC
   builds out there which are closer to $500.

   The great thing about this build is everything works perfectly in
   harmony to produce fantastic performance across a number of games and
   platforms. We consider it to be perfectly rounded whilst still housing
   the ability to be upgraded further down the line if necessary. However,
   with the build being equipped with AMD's 2400g which has decent onboard
   graphics, you won't have to upgrade anytime soon if you stick to modern
   games at medium settings.


What games can this PC run?

   In this section, we’re going to tell you how this game should be able
   to run your favorite games.
     * Fortnite - Fortnite should run at 1080p60 and high settings with
       little, if any, issues.
     * PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds - PUBG should run at medium settings
       in 1080p60.
     * Monster Hunter: World - MHW will run at 1080p60 with medium
       settings.
     * League of Legends - Due to being a light eSports title, League
       should be easily pushed to 1080p60 by this build.
     * Dota 2 - Same as above.
     * Overwatch - Overwatch should be very playable at high-to-max
       settings and 1080p60.
     * Rainbow Six: Siege -  Siege should run just fine at medium settings
       in 1080p60, maybe even a few higher settings.
     * Warframe -  Warframe won’t be an issue for this PC build at all-
       expect 1080p60 at max settings with ease.
     * Grand Theft Auto V - GTA V should be playable at 1080p60, but you
       may need to turn down some settings to medium to keep a high
       framerate.
     * Team Fortress 2 - TF2 will do great at 1080p, but due to the weaker
       CPU in this build you may have difficulty with pushing it past 60
       FPS on high settings.

Similar Prebuilt Gaming PC Under $400

   It is great building your own cheap desktop computer especially if
   you’re on a tight budget.

   Nonetheless, not everyone is fond of building their own gaming computer
   due to the hassle that comes with it. If you're one of the folks that
   isn't overly keen on the idea of building your own, then you'll be
   happy to know we've searched the web for the best pre-builds for around
   $400.

   In the Q1 of 2019, the shortage of GPU greatly affected custom built
   prices, so we added these sections to our builds. This was what
   triggered the why you should buy a prebuilt PC now trend. While this
   advice was mostly only relevant for a short window in time, there are
   still great prebuilt gaming desktops in the $400 range:
     * Cyberpower Desktop Gaming PC
     * CUK Continuum Micro Gamer PC
     * IBUYPOWER Enthusiastic Gaming PC

Future Upgrade Options

   It’s no doubt that this custom $400 build is already plenty powerful
   but here are a few upgrades you can opt for if you want an extra edge
   down the line.
   NOTE: These will raise the price of the build!
   gpu
     * XFX Radeon RX 570 RS XXX Edition 1286MHz

XFX Radeon RX 570 RS XXX Edition 1286MHz

   The RX 570 is both a massive step up in price and more importantly
   performance. It currently boasts a considerable step up from the
   onboard graphics that the $400 build currently houses. With this
   powerhouse, you’ll be exceeding the PS4 Pro by a pretty good margin,
   and will also start knocking on the door to VR capabilities! You won’t
   have a problem playing games at 1080p/60fps with this card either
   However, it’s not all good news since buying this GPU will add a decent
   $150 to the cost of the build. But after that, you can relax for the
   next year or so without upgrades.

OS Options and Recommended Peripherals

   Like other build guides you can find online, we don’t include the price
   of the OS and peripherals in the build. This is for a lot of reasons,
   but typically users will have at least some of these things before
   jumping in.
   In case you’re missing some or all of these things, we’ve provided a
   list of easy recommendations below.

Operating System

   This budget $400 gaming PC can’t do its fragging without an operating
   system. If you don’t have a pre-existing retail Windows installation to
   carry over from an old PC to this one, here’s our recommendations.

Windows 10

   Windows 10

   If you want maximum performance and compatibility, buy a Windows 10
   license. This is an expensive route, but it will ensure that you get
   the most out of your rig. Windows still comes in DVD format if that is
   more convenient for your needs.

   Note: if you need antivirus software, please read our guide to the best
   free antivirus software available today.
   Operating System

   If you can’t afford Windows right now, you can also opt for a Linux
   distribution. If you go that route, Ubuntu Linux and Linux Mint are our
   highest-recommended for usability and support. Do note, however, that
   they will be harder to use and not all games will be compatible with
   them.

Mouse and Keyboard

   Need some basic input devices? We’ve got you covered.

Roccat KONE Pure SE

   Roccat KONE Pure SE

   The Roccat Kone Pure SE is our top budget mouse pick for the $400
   build, fantastic ergonomic design, superb high performance optical
   sensor and a very respectable price tag. What more could you want? If
   you’re looking to splash out a bit more on peripherals then why not

Redragon K552-RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard

   Meanwhile, Redragon K552 serves as an excellent budget mechanical
   keyboard solution. The idea of budget mechanical keyboards used to be

Monitor

   No point in buying the $400 gaming PC if you can’t enjoy the pretty
   graphics, right?

BenQ ZOWIE RL2455S 24 Inch Gaming Monitor

   BenQ ZOWIE RL2455S 24 Inch Gaming Monitor

   The Benq RL2455S 24” gaming monitor should serve this build perfectly
   if you don’t have anything laying around. Its 1080p resolution is more
   than enough for Ryzen’s onboard Vega 11 graphics you’re packing, and
   with a 1ms response time on top of that, you should be in business for
   solid gaming. The screen comes in at 24 inches and, as you would expect
   from Benq, is well built. If that isn’t enough for you, you should take
   a look at our in-depth 20 monitor roundup guide. If you have ambitious
   dreams of gaming at 1440p or 144HZ one day, we recommend investing in a
   monitor for your future upgrades.

Sound Options

   Good audio design is integral to an immersive gaming experience, and
   you aren’t going to get that with built-in monitor speakers or cheap
   earbuds. Here are some great budget audio options if you need them.

Creative Inspire T12 2.0 Multimedia Speaker

   Creative Inspire T12 2.0 Multimedia Speaker

   The Creative Inspire T12 Speakers are a great entry option. These

   subwoofing, but they will allow you to enjoy quality audio at a fair
   price. MORE: Best Computer Speakers

HyperX Cloud Stinger Gaming Headset

   HyperX Cloud Stinger Gaming Headset

   If you’re more serious about gaming, though, especially competitively,
   you’re going to want a headset. Our favorite budget solution is the
   HyperX Cloud Stinger Gaming headset, which is built fairly well
   (despite its low price) and should provide you with good comms and
   situational awareness in games. If you’re a little more invested in
   gaming then we would suggest having a look at our best gaming headsets
   article.

Getting Online

ASUS PCE-AC56 Wireless Express Adapter

   ASUS PCE-AC56 Wireless Express Adapter

   The ASUS PCE-AC56 Wireless Adapter is a great, convenient Wi-Fi
   solution at a fair price. If you must use wireless then it’s really
   worth while investing in a decent adapter.  For the most stable gaming
   experience, though, go with wired.

Wired (Ethernet Cable)

   Wired (Ethernet Cable)

   Buying this ethernet cable off Amazon should give you all the wired
   stability and performance you’re looking for. We highly recommend this
   if you’re serious about gaming in any competitive manner.

Building Tips

   You may now know the components you’ll need to create our $400 gaming
   PC build, but that doesn’t mean you know how to build a cheap gaming
   PC, or any other price range for that matter. Most people have
   questions about PC building, especially if they are new to building a
   PC. And of course, there are a lot of easy mistakes you should be aware
   of so that you know what to avoid.

Invest In Antistatic Equipment

   Computer parts are delicate. Most intuitively understand this, hence
   why they’re scared of “messing up”. But one major step you can take to
   avoid “messing up” is using an anti-static wristband. These help
   dissipate static discharge, which would otherwise ruin your components
   before you’ve even put them together.

   But they only work if you know how to use the anti-static wristband
   properly.

   To save some extra stress and make your workplace computer-friendly,
   you can also buy an anti-static mat, which you rest your parts on while
   working.

Watch Building Guides

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4Js2A1qdB8

   By using Tek Syndicate’s in-depth build video and the instruction
   manuals that come with your components, you should be well on your way
   to assembling your new budget PC.

   Building will always take longer for a first timer; however, with the
   right guidance (and mastery over standoff screws!), it should go pretty
   smoothly.

   If you need further instructions, our detailed step-by-step How to
   Build a PC guide should help you out. We cover everything from deciding
   your budget to long-term computer maintenance.

Install OS Via USB

   Don’t shell out extra for an optical drive you’re only going to use
   once. Instead, grab a 4GB USB stick and install your OS like a real
   enthusiast!

   To do this on Windows, simply plug it into your PC and install Windows
   10 Media Creation Tool. The program will walk you through the rest of
   the (easy) process, and, in no time, you’ll have a portable Windows
   installer!

   For Linux distributions, use UNetbootin or Rufus instead. Same
   instructions apply.

Closing Thoughts

   The best $400 gaming PC is complete! You have a budget gaming PC that
   can butt heads with the PS4 Pro while still enjoying all the benefits
   the PC platform has to offer. This includes lower game prices and
   endless upgradeability.

   How did you find the build? Are you unsure of something? Do you want to
   sacrifice a little to suit your budget? Tell us down the comments!

            Prices change every now and then but on average, it’s around
            the $400 range. I’d recommend you regularly check the prices
            to get the best deals if you could wait. In fact, it could go
            as low as $380-$390.

            Hello, Fatty Fredegar! Older MSI A320M PRO-VHL Motherboard may
            need a BIOS update for the Ryzen 3 2200G to work. It’s
            perfectly alright to go with the R3 2200G instead of the R3
            1200. But the reason why we decided to go with the R3 1200 is
            the fact it performs better than the 2200G when you overclock
            it. You also have true16x PCI-E support, which means you won’t
            be sacrificing your RAM for video memory 🙂

            Hi Dovi! Thanks for dropping by! So here are the answers to
            your questions:
            1. I wonder could I use a Razen 3 1300x
            > Yes, definitely. It’s compatible with the motherboard in
            this build.
            2. 1050 ti EVGA 4
            >No problem
            3. 8 gigs of ram
            >As long as it’s DDR4, up to 32GB
            4. with this power supply?
            >Yes. With the build you asked, it shouldn’t go over 300 watts
            max so the PSU should be able to carry the build smoothly.
            5. And if I do want an optical drive, should I get a more
            powerful CPU?
            > What kind of optical drive, specifically? Regardless, you
            won’t need a more powerful CPU if you want to add an optical
            drive.
            6. also in time could I add a solid state to this Build?
            >Yes, definitely 🙂

       Good afternoon; so I have some questions about this build : first-
       do you think this build can handle not only pc games like fortnite
       ,steam games… at a good framerate and also run emulator and retro
       games with a goood framerate (emulator games are based arrond
       opengl and directx , I just wish to understand if this build can
       hnadle the lattest versoins of both) . Second- Do you recomend the
       ryson 5 1600 X instead of the rysen 3 1200? or do you think it´s
       gonna slow down the gaming expirience? tanks for reading.

            Hi Afonso! You won’t have problems with Fortnite on this rig.
            In fact, it could handle most AAA games out there
            (60FPS/1080p) with a mix of low/high graphics settings. Also,
            which emulator, specifically, if I may ask? Becuase if you’re
            going to use the Dolphin emulator or the PSX2 emulators, you
            shouldn’t have problems with it in terms of performance.
            Dolphin specifically recommends Ryzen CPUs from the AMD line
            processors. PSX2, on the other hand, recommends an AMD Phenom
            II @ 3.2 GHz.
            We always recommend you get the better CPU if you have the
            money. Obviously, it’s going to cost you more than $400
            because aside from the fact that the R5 1600x is more
            expensive, you’ll also need a separate cooler since it doesn’t
            come with a cooler like the R3 1200’s Wraith Stealth.

                 1050 ti you also recomend instead of the normal evga

                      SSD because of the crazy boost in speed vs HDD. Your
                      course of action is great but I strongly recommend

       sim racing semi-seriously on iRacing or maybe Assetto Corsa. I like
       the look of a lot of this hardware listed here, but as this would
       only really used on one type of game, are there any potential
       corners I could cut (thus saving money) but still keep a fairly
       decent performance?

            Hi, Bren! How are you! Thanks for dropping by! iRacing and
            Assetto Corsa can be played at Full HD (1080p) with more than
            60FPS on this rig. We can definitely cut corners to even
            reduce the cost. I just want to confirm – are you going to use
            this rig only for racing sims and nothing else? Or perhaps a
            little internet browsing here and there, maybe?

                      In that case, this is more than enough, to be
                      honest. You could somehow cut the cost by getting a
                      500GB HDD ($10 lesser than the 1TB) and a Rosewill
                      FBM-X1 chassis (about $20 cheaper than the Versa H15
                      on this article). But personally, I’d stay with the
                      1TB HDD but get the Rosewill FBM-X1 chassis instead.

       Hey you stated if you upgraded to EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB and
       wanted to avoid bottleneck you’d need to upgrade the CPU. What
       would you recommend for this? Would there be any other parts that
       would be optimum to go with this upgrade? Thank you

            Hey CamBar! How are you? Yes, a bottleneck may occur but only
            in titles that are very heavily CPU dependent. But when it
            comes to most games these days, there shouldn’t be any, and
            it’s going to be very small if there are. Getting another 4GB
            of RAM will definitely boost the performance overall,
            especially since Ryzen CPUs perform better with more RAM.
            Alternatively, the 256GB SSD upgrade should make the entire
            build even faster–almost no loading times and no boot times.
            What games are you going to be playing?

            with an outtake fan at the rear of the case. This fan is

            fantastic budget cooler.

       I’m not one to to be a downer, but the CPU chosen for this build is
       actually TERRIBLE if you want to have a consistent fps in modern
       games. Anything less than four cores in unacceptable. Sure you can
       run most titles, but you won’t have a smooth gaming experience I
       can guarantee that. for 400 dollars, you should find an old PC such
       as a Dell Optiplex (Universities usually throw them out if they
       upgrade their pc’s) that has previous gen I5’s or I7’s. I got mine
       for around 200 bucks, put in a GTX 970 and a new power supply and I
       had one of the best gaming experiences of my life, all for less
       than 400 bucks..
       THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH GOING USED BOYS.

            stock cooler will come with some thermal paste applied
            already, however, it’s often quite dry and it is recommended
            you replace it before installing the fan. The best I have used

       If I’m using a 500W power supply, would it be possible for me to
       upgrade this build by adding ram and a new CPU, like an i5 or i7.
       Also for a wireless internet option, do you know if an AC 1900
       Archer T9E would be compatible for this build?

       I have never built a pc before and I am very interested in this
       build. It is affordable for me but I am nervous on the actual
       assembly of the PC. Could I follow any YouTube PC building tutorial
       or is there any that you would recommend. Also, on one video I
       watched it says you need to have a wifi card in order to connect to
       the internet wirelessly without an ethernet cable. Is this true?

            On this specific motherboard, you will have to get a WIFI card
            to connect wirelessly. Other motherboards have it built in
            though.

            Hi Aricin, The only thing to be cautious with in this build is
            installing the CPU but don’t worry it is fairly simple to do,
            For help when building visit our in-depth guide
            https://www.wepc.com/how-to/build-a-gaming-pc/.
            This build is a budget PC with room for future upgrades,

            budget.

       Nice build but i recommend changing the i3-8100 Quad core to a
       Ryzen 5 1600 6 core, 12 thread as well as using Gigabytes $120 570
       4gb instead as the OC version will be of no use with the
       motherboard. Other than that if you make those changes you will
       have enough extra room to add a 120gb SSD from Kingston A400
       series, which will increase the performance of this build
       drastically.

            Hi Bryan, You are looking at around 40-60FPS in Apex Legends
            when settings are on high. On medium settings, you will get a
            stable 60FPS with highs of 75+ and on low settings between
            70-100 FPS.

       Question about the APU–where I live (Pakistan) there is not a huge
       price differential ($20-$30) between the following 2 APUs:
       – AMD Ryzen 5 2400g 3.9GHZ 4MB Cache
       – AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.9GHZ 16MB Cache
       Everything else in the build being held equal, would you recommend
       I upgrade to the 2600 or stick with the 2400?

            UPDATE: After a little bit of searching I have realized that
            the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 with Wraith Stealth Cooler and the Intel
            i5 9400F are almost the same price. The Intel is actually
            available for $10-$15 cheaper than the AMD.
            I looked through your suggested builds for different price
            points and am a little confused as to what would be a better
            option. Any advice?
            The AMD Ryzen 5 2600x with Wraith Spire Cooler is costing a
            fair bit more than either of the above, so that’d be a stretch
            for me.
            Any insight would be much appreciated! Thanks. =)

                 Hello, Saad thanks for the comment.
                 If you are planning on overclocking your system then 2600
                 will come out on top of the 9400F. If you are not going
                 to overclock the CPU then the 9400F is better as a stock
                 CPU and would be the smarter choice.

            there is no physical GPU inside but one can be added if you

            Hi Lander, this build features an APU processor which actually
            uses its own onboard graphics so no GPU cable is required. If
            you plan on upgrading and adding a GPU then what cable you use
            will depend on the power required, which will most likely be
            anything between a 6-pin and 10-pin connection.

                      Hi Phan, if you upgrade the graphics card to the one
                      in the upgrade path you will get over 100 FPS in max
                      settings on R6 Siege. This may be more FPS than you
                      require but this card will give you extra
                      flexibility and will handle a wide variety of games
                      in good settings. I’ll link you to it in case you

            Hi Josh, thanks for the comment. The case includes a fan but
            for an alternative id recommend the cheaply priced arctic F12
            fan – https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0119T0D4I/?tag=wepcus-20

                 The MSI B450M PRO M2 motherboard has one system fan
                 connection and one cpu fan connection. Can you please
                 tell me how you would connect a third fan? Thanks

                      Hi JM, have you looked into getting a fan splitter?

                           Hi Charlie, thanks for your response. I’ve seen
                           a couple out there. Would you be able to
                           suggest a good fan splitter? Is there a limit
                           to the fans you can connect to one header? It
                           doesnt specify in the mobo manual. Thanks

                                If it was me, I’d probably go for a Noctua
                                splitter. Even though the difference is
                                probably minimal, it’s always worth going
                                for a well known brand.
                                As far as limits are concerned. I think 4
                                is the max on a splitter. However, if you
                                get a fan controller, you can get much
                                more. That will need to be powered into
                                your PSU directly though.
                                How many fans do you plan on adding?

                                     The case only has one fan at the back
                                     so I wanted to add one up front to
                                     get some better airflow. Sounds like
                                     a splitter is the way to go for this
                                     application. Thanks

            Hi Jesse, thanks for the comment. Yes the APU featured is
            capable of running a dual monitor setup. On some board at
            least one of the two monitors has to be digital(HDMI or DVI).

       Just built this pc yesterday with a few of my touches and a
       different case and 2400 Mhz 16Gb RAM. Runs CSGO Medium settings 70+
       FPS. Haven’t tried other games since i don’t own any but next up is
       PUBG. Hopefully it can run it.

            Hi, thanks for commenting. The 2400g does a fine a job for
            what it is, however, the APU is limited so will struggle
            compared to a dedicated graphics card.

       Hi! Great article. I’m thinking of building it soon. I’m new, so I
       have a quick question: Where is the GPU? Do i not need one or is it
       in the motherboard or something?? thanks.

            Hi Reid,
            That’s a great question, and one we get regularly from people
            that are new to building computers.
            The AMD 2400g in this build is an APU. An APU, for those that
            aren’t aware, is a CPU with a pretty decent onboard graphics
            card built-in. You do not need a graphics card with this
            build, it will handle the lesser graphically demanding games
            fine.

       Do you need to upgrade the power supply to add the optional
       graphics card you have listed? The specs for the graphics card ask
       for a 500w ps

            Hi Jim, thanks for the comment. This PSU will be more than
            fine to power this GPU but if you want to future proof your
            set up then going a bit higher is no issue either.

            Hi Pat, do you recall that you definitely installed the
            standoff screws(screws between motherboard and case). Another
            quick thing to try is to take your RAM out, make sure they are
            in the correct slots, re-install and listen out for the click.
            Let me know if this has any effect, please!
