tuition insurance: not even kidding–3 reasons you NEED it

   It’s crazy, all of the things we need to think about as parents, isn’t
   it? Healthcare, school community, family dynamics. Vaccinations, online
   safety, and friendships. It can be so much.  So, when I come across
   something that is recommended to me by a reliable source or good pal, I
   tend to go with it.  I didn’t have the bandwidth to do the legwork and
   research needed to find an orthodontist, so when we realized that Maddy
   was in dire need of some teeth-straightening, I … Read More...

online PD to fit your busy schedule

   I have been writing about the importance of meaningful learning for
   over ten years, and whether you’re in the classroom or not, I cannot
   stress enough the importance of continuing to learn--no matter your
   age! The problem is that often, as busy parents and educators, we just
   cannot find the time for it. We’re running on steam as it is, so how
   can we add one more thing to the list, even if we know we need it? Even
   if our certificate needs to be renewed or if we know we need to learn

summer swim team: an absolute MUST for families

   Summer swim has been a staple for our family for the last six years.
   Ever since Maddy joined the pre-team the summer before Kindergarten,
   we've spent the first seven weeks of summer camped out at the pool in
   the mornings and have spent our Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings
   at swim meets and Sunday afternoons at dive meets. We are grateful that
   our neighborhood pool is within walking distance from our home, and we
   definitely take advantage of it. But even if your family is not within

5 ideas for helping parents read with their kids: podcast
