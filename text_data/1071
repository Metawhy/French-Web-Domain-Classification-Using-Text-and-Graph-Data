Huawei announces computing strategy and releases Atlas 900, the world's
fastest AI training cluster

   Sep 18, 2019

   [Shanghai, China, September 18, 2019] At HUAWEI CONNECT 2019, Huawei
   announced its strategy for the computing market and released Atlas 900,
   the world's fastest AI training cluster. A powerhouse of AI computing,
   Atlas 900 will help make AI more readily available for different fields
   of scientific research and business innovation.

   Ken Hu outlines Huawei’s computing strategy in his keynote at HUAWEI
   CONNECT 2019

   "The future of computing is a massive market worth more than two
   trillion US dollars," said Ken Hu, Huawei's Deputy Chairman. "We'll
   keep investing with a strategy that focuses on four key areas. We will
   push the boundaries of architecture, invest in processors for all
   scenarios, keep clear business boundaries, and build an open
   ecosystem."

   Huawei's computing strategy

   The industry's approach to computing is evolving from rule-based to
   statistical models, which are the foundation of machine learning.
   Huawei estimates that in the next five years, statistical computing
   will become the mainstream and AI computing will account for more than
   80% of all computing power used around the world.

   To carve out a place in this market, Huawei's strategy will focus on
   four key areas:
     * Architecture innovation. Last year Huawei launched the Da Vinci
       architecture, an innovative processor architecture designed to
       provide a steady and abundant supply of affordable computing power.
       Huawei will continue to invest in basic research.
     * Investment in all-scenario processors. Huawei has a full lineup of
       processors: Kunpeng processors for general purpose computing,
       Ascend processors for AI, Kirin processors for smart devices, and
       Honghu processors for smart screens.
     * Clear business boundaries. Huawei won't sell its processors
       directly. Instead, it will provide them to its customers in the
       form of cloud services, and to its partners in the form of
       components, prioritizing support for integrated solutions.
     * Building an open ecosystem. In the next five years, Huawei will
       invest another US$1.5 billion in its developer program. The aim is
       to expand the program to support five million developers and enable
       Huawei's worldwide partners to develop the next generation of
       intelligent applications and solutions.

   Atlas 900, the world's fastest AI training cluster

   Building on the technical strengths that Huawei has developed over the
   past decade, Atlas 900 combines the power of thousands of Ascend
   processors. It takes Atlas 900 only 59.8 seconds to train ResNet-50,
   the gold standard for measuring AI training performance. This is 10
   seconds faster than the previous world record.

   Atlas 900 is a powerhouse of AI computing, and it will bring new
   possibilities to different fields of scientific research and business
   innovation – anything from astronomy, weather forecasting, and
   autonomous driving, to oil exploration. Huawei also deployed Atlas 900
   on Huawei Cloud as a cluster service, making extraordinary computing
   power more broadly accessible to its customers across different
   industries. Huawei has offered these services at a great discount to
   universities and scientific research institutes worldwide.

   Gao Wen, a Member of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Director of
   Peng Cheng Lab, also spoke at this year's event. He shared the mission
   and vision of Peng Cheng Lab and how the organization will work with
   Huawei to build China's first evolving AI supercomputing system that
   supports exascale computing. The two companies will work together to
   establish a new generation of platforms for AI basic research and
   innovation.

   Zheng Yelai, President of Huawei's Cloud BU, talked about how AI can be
   applied in different scenarios. Based on Huawei's experience in over
   500 projects across more than 10 industries, Zheng pointed out that
   industry AI is crossing the commercial chasm and becoming the key
   driver for reshaping how companies go digital.

   "This is a new age of exploration," Ken Hu concluded. "An ocean of
   boundless potential is waiting, but just one ship won't cut it. Today
   we launch a thousand ships. Let's work together, seize this historic
   opportunity, and advance intelligence to new heights."

   HUAWEI CONNECT 2019 is an annual flagship event hosted by Huawei for
   the global ICT industry, and is held in Shanghai from September 18 to
   20, 2019. This year’s Conference is themed on "Advance Intelligence"
   and aims to establish an open, cooperative, and shared platform for
   customers and partners to explore new opportunities for an intelligent
   future.

     *

   [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, October 3, 2019] In a significant step towards
   superior connectivity for Malaysia, Maxis and Huawei Technologies
   Malaysia (Huawei) today signed an agreement for the provisioning of 5G
   network in the country. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Yang Amat
   Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia
   at Yayasan Kepimpinan Perdana, Putrajaya.

   Signing the agreement on behalf of Maxis was its Chief Executive
   Officer, Gokhan Ogut, while Huawei was represented by Michael Yuan, its
   Chief Executive Officer.

   Accompanying the Prime Minister at the signing were Yang Berhormat Tuan
   Eddin Syazlee Shith, Deputy Minister of Communication and Multimedia
   and Yang Berusaha Encik Al-Ishsal Ishak, Chairman of the Malaysian
   Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). Also present at the
   signing were Maxis’ Chairman, Yang Mulia Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad
   bin Raja Tun Uda,  Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier
   BG, Huawei and Jeffery Liu, President of South Pacific Region, Huawei.

   Maxis and Huawei Technologies Malaysia sign 5G agreement

   The agreement marks an important milestone in Maxis’ 5G journey as it
   commits to deliver the best 5G innovation to benefit the people and
   businesses in Malaysia. 5G will be the fastest network and far more
   advanced in terms of robustness, latency, peak speed and reliability
   with potential speeds reaching 10Gbps.

   With this agreement, Maxis has committed to work with its long-term
   network partner, Huawei, to launch 5G in Malaysia. As part of the
   agreement, Huawei will be supplying 4G/LTE and 5G radio equipment and
   services. Besides having access to 5G technologies, Maxis will able to
   modernise its existing LTE network to be 5G-ready. Leveraging on
   existing investments and footprint, Maxis will be able to facilitate
   faster rollout of 5G services when spectrum is available.

   Additionally, Maxis will have access to insights, standards, products
   and solutions that would make 5G easier to deploy and operate and
   introduce new use cases in Malaysia. Huawei will also be putting
   together a strong team of experts to support Maxis on a series of
   technical training programmes on planning, operations and maintenance
   of the 5G network.

   Yang Amat Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of
   Malaysia, said, “The impact of advanced technologies on our progress as
   a nation is inevitable and we cannot afford to be left behind,
   especially with Industry 4.0 already upon us. There is no doubt that 5G
   will be a key driver to connecting everyone in Malaysia and
   transforming key industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and
   healthcare so that we can remain globally competitive. Collaboration
   between global players and local vendors is important to support a
   thriving technology ecosystem in Malaysia. I am pleased to see Maxis
   and Huawei taking advantage of this environment and supporting the
   growth of Malaysia’s digital economy.”

   YM Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad bin Raja Tun Uda, Chairman of Maxis,
   said, “This is an important moment not just for Maxis, but for everyone
   in Malaysia as we prepare ourselves for an exciting future of next
   generation connectivity. Today’s signing therefore represents
   significant progress in our journey and commitment to accelerate 5G in
   Malaysia. We are pleased to be working with global technology leader
   and our long term partner, Huawei, whose experience, expertise and
   capabilities in 5G complement our ambitions to be Malaysia’s leading
   converged solutions company. We would like to thank the Government for
   its instrumental role in driving the 5G national agenda, and we look
   forward to continue working with the Ministry of Communication and
   Multimedia and MCMC throughout our journey.”

   Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier BG, Huawei, said that
   “Malaysia has been making tremendous progress in connecting the
   unconnected and embracing new ICT infrastructure development. With 5G
   technology deployment, we foresee Malaysia will go through a phase of
   rapid digital transformation. 5G technology is expected to accelerate
   the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), which will be a part of
   implementation of an end-to-end solution that covers the supply chain
   to meet the requirements of building a smart nation. Our vision is
   aligned with the Government of Malaysia in bringing digital to every
   person, home and organisation for a fully connected, intelligent world.
   Maxis has always been at the forefront in introducing new technologies
   to Malaysia. It was the first to bring 4G to the market and continues
   to invest significantly in this area to maintain its 4G network
   leadership in terms of speed, performance and experience, as attested
   by MCMC’s 2018 Network Performance Report as well as independent
   studies. Huawei has supported the deployment of 5G by many operators
   globally. The company brings with them years of expertise and research
   in 5G, having set up a platform for operators and industry partners to
   incubate 5G applications together. Working together for over 10 years,
   Huawei has supported Maxis to become the undisputed network leader in
   the country.”

   Maxis’ 5G journey

   Maxis has long started its 5G journey. Over the last few years, Maxis
   has been assessing the technology and conducting demo trials in its
   test lab. Maxis has been upgrading its transport network to support the
   gigabit speeds and at the same time virtualising its core network
   elements for flexibility and scalability for the capacity demands of
   this technology.

   In February, Maxis and Huawei signed an MoU to cooperate on
   full-fledged 5G trials. Following this, Maxis commenced the first 5G
   live trials in the country, where it recorded close to 3Gbps download
   speeds. Maxis also participated in MCMC’s #5GMalaysia showcase in
   Putrajaya, demonstrating how 5G can enable Government and corporations
   to make informed decisions using the technology. Most recently, Maxis
   and Huawei brought its 5G showcase to Kuching at IDECS 2019.

Huawei announces computing strategy and releases Atlas 900, the world's
fastest AI training cluster

   Sep 18, 2019

   [Shanghai, China, September 18, 2019] At HUAWEI CONNECT 2019, Huawei
   announced its strategy for the computing market and released Atlas 900,
   the world's fastest AI training cluster. A powerhouse of AI computing,
   Atlas 900 will help make AI more readily available for different fields
   of scientific research and business innovation.

   Ken Hu outlines Huawei’s computing strategy in his keynote at HUAWEI
   CONNECT 2019

   "The future of computing is a massive market worth more than two
   trillion US dollars," said Ken Hu, Huawei's Deputy Chairman. "We'll
   keep investing with a strategy that focuses on four key areas. We will
   push the boundaries of architecture, invest in processors for all
   scenarios, keep clear business boundaries, and build an open
   ecosystem."

   Huawei's computing strategy

   The industry's approach to computing is evolving from rule-based to
   statistical models, which are the foundation of machine learning.
   Huawei estimates that in the next five years, statistical computing
   will become the mainstream and AI computing will account for more than
   80% of all computing power used around the world.

   To carve out a place in this market, Huawei's strategy will focus on
   four key areas:
     * Architecture innovation. Last year Huawei launched the Da Vinci
       architecture, an innovative processor architecture designed to
       provide a steady and abundant supply of affordable computing power.
       Huawei will continue to invest in basic research.
     * Investment in all-scenario processors. Huawei has a full lineup of
       processors: Kunpeng processors for general purpose computing,
       Ascend processors for AI, Kirin processors for smart devices, and
       Honghu processors for smart screens.
     * Clear business boundaries. Huawei won't sell its processors
       directly. Instead, it will provide them to its customers in the
       form of cloud services, and to its partners in the form of
       components, prioritizing support for integrated solutions.
     * Building an open ecosystem. In the next five years, Huawei will
       invest another US$1.5 billion in its developer program. The aim is
       to expand the program to support five million developers and enable
       Huawei's worldwide partners to develop the next generation of
       intelligent applications and solutions.

   Atlas 900, the world's fastest AI training cluster

   Building on the technical strengths that Huawei has developed over the
   past decade, Atlas 900 combines the power of thousands of Ascend
   processors. It takes Atlas 900 only 59.8 seconds to train ResNet-50,
   the gold standard for measuring AI training performance. This is 10
   seconds faster than the previous world record.

   Atlas 900 is a powerhouse of AI computing, and it will bring new
   possibilities to different fields of scientific research and business
   innovation – anything from astronomy, weather forecasting, and
   autonomous driving, to oil exploration. Huawei also deployed Atlas 900
   on Huawei Cloud as a cluster service, making extraordinary computing
   power more broadly accessible to its customers across different
   industries. Huawei has offered these services at a great discount to
   universities and scientific research institutes worldwide.

   Gao Wen, a Member of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Director of
   Peng Cheng Lab, also spoke at this year's event. He shared the mission
   and vision of Peng Cheng Lab and how the organization will work with
   Huawei to build China's first evolving AI supercomputing system that
   supports exascale computing. The two companies will work together to
   establish a new generation of platforms for AI basic research and
   innovation.

   Zheng Yelai, President of Huawei's Cloud BU, talked about how AI can be
   applied in different scenarios. Based on Huawei's experience in over
   500 projects across more than 10 industries, Zheng pointed out that
   industry AI is crossing the commercial chasm and becoming the key
   driver for reshaping how companies go digital.

   "This is a new age of exploration," Ken Hu concluded. "An ocean of
   boundless potential is waiting, but just one ship won't cut it. Today
   we launch a thousand ships. Let's work together, seize this historic
   opportunity, and advance intelligence to new heights."

   HUAWEI CONNECT 2019 is an annual flagship event hosted by Huawei for
   the global ICT industry, and is held in Shanghai from September 18 to
   20, 2019. This year’s Conference is themed on "Advance Intelligence"
   and aims to establish an open, cooperative, and shared platform for
   customers and partners to explore new opportunities for an intelligent
   future.

     *

   [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, October 3, 2019] In a significant step towards
   superior connectivity for Malaysia, Maxis and Huawei Technologies
   Malaysia (Huawei) today signed an agreement for the provisioning of 5G
   network in the country. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Yang Amat
   Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia
   at Yayasan Kepimpinan Perdana, Putrajaya.

   Signing the agreement on behalf of Maxis was its Chief Executive
   Officer, Gokhan Ogut, while Huawei was represented by Michael Yuan, its
   Chief Executive Officer.

   Accompanying the Prime Minister at the signing were Yang Berhormat Tuan
   Eddin Syazlee Shith, Deputy Minister of Communication and Multimedia
   and Yang Berusaha Encik Al-Ishsal Ishak, Chairman of the Malaysian
   Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). Also present at the
   signing were Maxis’ Chairman, Yang Mulia Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad
   bin Raja Tun Uda,  Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier
   BG, Huawei and Jeffery Liu, President of South Pacific Region, Huawei.

   Maxis and Huawei Technologies Malaysia sign 5G agreement

   The agreement marks an important milestone in Maxis’ 5G journey as it
   commits to deliver the best 5G innovation to benefit the people and
   businesses in Malaysia. 5G will be the fastest network and far more
   advanced in terms of robustness, latency, peak speed and reliability
   with potential speeds reaching 10Gbps.

   With this agreement, Maxis has committed to work with its long-term
   network partner, Huawei, to launch 5G in Malaysia. As part of the
   agreement, Huawei will be supplying 4G/LTE and 5G radio equipment and
   services. Besides having access to 5G technologies, Maxis will able to
   modernise its existing LTE network to be 5G-ready. Leveraging on
   existing investments and footprint, Maxis will be able to facilitate
   faster rollout of 5G services when spectrum is available.

   Additionally, Maxis will have access to insights, standards, products
   and solutions that would make 5G easier to deploy and operate and
   introduce new use cases in Malaysia. Huawei will also be putting
   together a strong team of experts to support Maxis on a series of
   technical training programmes on planning, operations and maintenance
   of the 5G network.

   Yang Amat Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of
   Malaysia, said, “The impact of advanced technologies on our progress as
   a nation is inevitable and we cannot afford to be left behind,
   especially with Industry 4.0 already upon us. There is no doubt that 5G
   will be a key driver to connecting everyone in Malaysia and
   transforming key industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and
   healthcare so that we can remain globally competitive. Collaboration
   between global players and local vendors is important to support a
   thriving technology ecosystem in Malaysia. I am pleased to see Maxis
   and Huawei taking advantage of this environment and supporting the
   growth of Malaysia’s digital economy.”

   YM Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad bin Raja Tun Uda, Chairman of Maxis,
   said, “This is an important moment not just for Maxis, but for everyone
   in Malaysia as we prepare ourselves for an exciting future of next
   generation connectivity. Today’s signing therefore represents
   significant progress in our journey and commitment to accelerate 5G in
   Malaysia. We are pleased to be working with global technology leader
   and our long term partner, Huawei, whose experience, expertise and
   capabilities in 5G complement our ambitions to be Malaysia’s leading
   converged solutions company. We would like to thank the Government for
   its instrumental role in driving the 5G national agenda, and we look
   forward to continue working with the Ministry of Communication and
   Multimedia and MCMC throughout our journey.”

   Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier BG, Huawei, said that
   “Malaysia has been making tremendous progress in connecting the
   unconnected and embracing new ICT infrastructure development. With 5G
   technology deployment, we foresee Malaysia will go through a phase of
   rapid digital transformation. 5G technology is expected to accelerate
   the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), which will be a part of
   implementation of an end-to-end solution that covers the supply chain
   to meet the requirements of building a smart nation. Our vision is
   aligned with the Government of Malaysia in bringing digital to every
   person, home and organisation for a fully connected, intelligent world.
   Maxis has always been at the forefront in introducing new technologies
   to Malaysia. It was the first to bring 4G to the market and continues
   to invest significantly in this area to maintain its 4G network
   leadership in terms of speed, performance and experience, as attested
   by MCMC’s 2018 Network Performance Report as well as independent
   studies. Huawei has supported the deployment of 5G by many operators
   globally. The company brings with them years of expertise and research
   in 5G, having set up a platform for operators and industry partners to
   incubate 5G applications together. Working together for over 10 years,
   Huawei has supported Maxis to become the undisputed network leader in
   the country.”

   Maxis’ 5G journey

   Maxis has long started its 5G journey. Over the last few years, Maxis
   has been assessing the technology and conducting demo trials in its
   test lab. Maxis has been upgrading its transport network to support the
   gigabit speeds and at the same time virtualising its core network
   elements for flexibility and scalability for the capacity demands of
   this technology.

   In February, Maxis and Huawei signed an MoU to cooperate on
   full-fledged 5G trials. Following this, Maxis commenced the first 5G
   live trials in the country, where it recorded close to 3Gbps download
   speeds. Maxis also participated in MCMC’s #5GMalaysia showcase in
   Putrajaya, demonstrating how 5G can enable Government and corporations
   to make informed decisions using the technology. Most recently, Maxis
   and Huawei brought its 5G showcase to Kuching at IDECS 2019.

Huawei's BusinessPON Private Line Solution Helps China Telecom Shanghai Build
Gigabit Enterprise Private Lines

   Sep 30, 2019
     *

   [Shanghai, China, September 30, 2019] Recently, China Telecom
   (Shanghai) announced that it will adopt Huawei's BusinessPON private
   line solution to build gigabit private lines for small- and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a latest move to help enterprises to
   go digital and various industries to prosper.

   As a pioneer in global fiber broadband construction, China Telecom
   (Shanghai) has built the first municipal full-fiber network to carry
   individual, home, enterprise, and industrial services over a unified
   platform. Currently, the full-fiber network is providing PON private
   line services for 300,000 SMEs.

   As more enterprises go digital and innovative services emerge, SMEs
   raise higher requirements on private line networks. For example, mobile
   game SMEs need private lines with higher bandwidths to more efficiently
   render images and audio on the cloud and improve user experience; chain
   stores require private lines that are faster and secure for saving
   sales data on the cloud; 3D building design start-ups require private
   lines with higher reliability and upstream rates to support remote
   customer viewing and real-time data synchronization to the cloud (one
   real map can be as large as 200 GB). In addition, SMEs usually have
   limited manpower, and need private lines that are easy to maintain.

   To provide SMEs with optimal private lines, China Telecom (Shanghai)
   and Huawei carried out joint innovation to develop new gigabit PON
   private lines. The BusinessPON private line solution is a key
   achievement of this joint innovation. The solution has the following
   features:
     * Wide coverage and fast connection: Fiber access resources are
       available anywhere, and hot areas are pre-covered. Gateways support
       plug and play, and services and connections can be provisioned for
       SMEs in minutes.
     * High bandwidth and continuous evolution: The solution provides up
       to 10 Gbps symmetric rates, improving the efficiency of uploading
       and downloading ultra-large files tenfold by 10 times.
     * High security and flexible access to the cloud: The secure IPSec
       VPN access and hardware encryption/decryption engine provide
       industry-leading tunnel performance and protect the security of
       enterprise data. Huawei-developed chips and optimization algorithms
       are used to support 3 Gbps VxLAN with one hop to the cloud. The
       forwarding performance is twice of the industry average, enabling
       high-speed cloud storage and access.
     * High reliability and quality assurance: The availability of
       selective enterprise gateways is up to 99.999%. The private lines
       have industry-leading performance in mean time between failures
       (MTBF), and meet carrier-class application requirements.
     * Simplified O&M, all in one: Gateways replace a stack of devices,
       simplifying enterprise networking and reducing IT O&M costs by 30%.

   A senior manager of China Telecom (Shanghai) said: "Huawei's
   BusinessPON private line solution helps us build differentiated private
   line products to meet scenario-based requirements of various SMEs and
   help them go digital. In the future, we will make more intense efforts
   to help various vertical industries go digital, smart, and prosperous
   through innovation."

   Jeffrey Zhou, president of Huawei's Access Network Product Line, said:
   "Enterprise digital transformation brings new opportunities for
   operators to develop the private line service. Huawei will intensify
   technological innovation in the gigabit ultra-broadband era and work
   with China Telecom (Shanghai) to explore the application of 10G PON
   technologies in the home, enterprise, and industry scenarios. Huawei's
   SingleFAN Pro access solution provides home users with premium gigabit
   broadband services, and provides massive SMEs with private lines that
   feature fast connection, high bandwidth, high security, high
   reliability, and simple O&M.

   Up to now, Huawei has signed commercial contracts with more than 30
   operators around the world for gigabit fiber broadband construction.
   The global shipment of 10G PON optical line terminals (OLTs) ports has
   exceeded 1.5 million, helping operators build leading-edge intelligent
   gigabit OptiX networks.

   [Delhi, India, September 29, 2019] Bharti India and Huawei jointly
   started innovation for enhanced MIMO solution of 5G microwave. Bharti
   India then deployed more than 100 hops of enhanced MIMO microwave link
   based on the latest MIMO technology developed by Huawei, which will
   deliver 1Gbps capacity over single 28Mhz spectrum, improving the
   backhaul capacity by four times.

   Adding CA technology to 1Gbps enhanced MIMO link will smoothly upgrade
   it to 2Gbps MIMO link with additional 28Mhz spectrum. This is made
   possible by Huawei’s innovative 5G CA (Carrier Aggregation) ODU’s
   simplified architecture, saving power consumption by 20% and reducing
   tower rental fee by 50% while achieving maximum transmission distance
   of up to 13 km. After half year’s observation, enhanced MIMO link are
   working stably with commercial traffic in Bharti’s live network.

   India Bharti cooperates with Huawei to launch the enhanced MIMO
   solution

   Microwave is the biggest and most important transmission solution for
   Bharti. To enhance leadership in India market, Bharti faces the problem
   of how to significantly improve microwave transmission bandwidth under
   limited frequency resources. To solve this problem, Huawei proposes
   enhanced MIMO solution, which resolves the bandwidth challenges,
   reduces tower space requirement by 50% and increases deployment
   scenario by 30%.

   Bharti implements the largest-scale MIMO deployment around the world.
   Huawei's 5G enhanced MIMO technology has been optimized to reduce the
   Rayleigh distance of LOS (Line of Sight) MIMO. Comparing with standard
   MIMO solution in microwave industry, the antenna installation distance
   is reduced by 70% and multipath interference of long-distance links is
   resolved to ensure MIMO links work stably. Large scale commercial
   deployment of MIMO is possible with Huawei enhanced MIMO solution.

   MIMO technology achieves four times capacity with same spectrum. In
   this way, telecom operator can build 5G ready transport network without
   extra spectrum investment. Huawei’s enhanced MIMO solution can reduce
   the antenna installation distance criteria, simplify MIMO deployment
   and reduce TCO. Perry Yang, President of Microwave Product Line of
   Huawei, said, "Creating value for customers with innovative
   technologies is the survival reason for Huawei microwave. Huawei
   microwave is looking forward to joint innovation with more operators
   for network development."
