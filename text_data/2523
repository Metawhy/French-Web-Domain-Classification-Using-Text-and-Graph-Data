Reviews

It is essential in our computer

   What do you like best?

   can be downloaded for free in its free version, and its main task is to
   detect and remove corrupt files, suspicious or spyware robots, which
   can be harmful to our computer.

   The design of this program is really simple, with practically four
   buttons, to do everything, but still, it has many options.

   What most attracts the attention of the program, at least to me, is the
   possibility of configuring it in several languages.

   What do you dislike?

   They should add other skins.

   and it has a relatively high Ram Consumption [Note from
   Safer-Networking: this has been fixed in Spybot 2.7].

   Recommendations to others considering the product

   I recommend it because it is free and has a simple interface with
   intuitive options, it is effective, it removes malware, and it is
   always updated.

   What business problems are you solving with the product? What benefits
   have you realized?

   protection in the work stations in combination with other antivirus
   makes me feel more protective against computer intrusions and malicious
   advertising.

Leigh Rach

   This to me looks like the best antimalware / antivirus on the market.
   will purchase soon. A must for every investor. Been using the free
   version for a very long time
   &bigstar;&bigstar;&bigstar;&bigstar;&bigstar;

Powerful & Low Cost

   What do you like best?

   Recommending to friends and family to use Spybot holds much more weight
   when they see that this popular security software is free for personal
   use.

   What do you dislike?

   The lack of antivirus for the personal use Spybot version can seem a
   bit unwelcome, but bundling Windows Defender along with Spybot tends to
   make up for this.

   Recommendations to others considering the product

   In recommending Spybot to potential users, I would note that the free
   personal version typically covers everything that you would need an a
   personal antimalware solution. Bundle this with a good antivirus
   program, and Spybot tends to do much of the heavy lifting.

   Moving on towards the professional version, it's a one stop shop for
   anything and everything you may need an an antivirus and/or antimalware
   solution. Moreso, the expert and advanced settings are very powerful
   tools in managing a secure IT environment.
