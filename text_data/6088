Lycamobile Bundles FAQs

What is a SIM Only Plan?

   When you buy a SIM only plan, you only get a SIM card with your choice
   of bundle. It does not come with a handset. Do note that a SIM only
   plan is a prepaid plan where you pay upfront for utilizing most of the
   services such as calling, texting, data, roaming (if applicable) and
   many more.

   At Lycamobile, we offer two types of SIM only plans. They are – Pay As
   You Go (PAYG) and Family saver plans.

What is a SIM only deal?

   A SIM only deal is very similar to a SIM only plan. This plan does not
   come with a handset either. In a SIM only deal, you get attractive
   calling, texting and data offers bundled with your SIM card. Once you
   activate the SIM, you can start using it immediately. All SIM only
   deals from Lycamobile come with a maximum validity of one-month, giving
   you the flexibility to change your plan after it expires, if needed.
   Most of the SIM only deals are exclusive offers that are available for
   a limited time.

   international bundles and choose what suits you the best.
