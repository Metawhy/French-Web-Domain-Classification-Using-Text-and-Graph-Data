CUDA Zone

   CUDA® is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed
   by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs).
   With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing
   applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.

   In GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of the workload
   runs on the CPU – which is optimized for single-threaded performance –
   while the compute intensive portion of the application runs on
   thousands of GPU cores in parallel. When using CUDA, developers program
   in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Python and MATLAB and
   express parallelism through extensions in the form of a few basic
   keywords.

   The CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA provides everything you need to develop
   GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA Toolkit includes GPU-accelerated
   libraries, a compiler, development tools and the CUDA runtime.

   The first GPUs were designed as graphics accelerators, becoming more
   programmable over the 90s, culminating in NVIDIA's first GPU in 1999.
   Researchers and scientists rapidly began to apply the excellent
   floating point performance of this GPU for general purpose computing.
   In 2003, a team of researchers led by Ian Buck unveiled Brook, the
   first widely adopted programming model to extend C with data-parallel
   constructs. Ian Buck later joined NVIDIA and led the launch of CUDA in
   2006, the world's first solution for general-computing on GPUs.

   Since its inception, the CUDA ecosystem has grown rapidly to include
   software development tools, services and partner-based solutions. The
   CUDA Toolkit includes libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a
   compiler and a runtime library to deploy your application. You'll also
   find code samples, programming guides, user manuals, API references and
   other documentation to help you get started.

3D Vision and Surround Technology

   Imagine immersing yourself in the world of 3D content like never
   before. Monsters, bullets, and landscapes jump out of your flat monitor
   and into your imagination, making you part of the game. With NVIDIA® 3D
   Vision, gaming will never be the same.

   2011 is a big year for 3D entertainment, with blockbuster 3D film
   releases, brand new 3D HDTVs, and expanding the 3D Vision technologies
   that make stereoscopic 3D for home users an inexpensive and
   high-quality option.

   What surprises most game developers is just how little they may have to
   do to fully 3D in the games they are making. In fact, many shipping
   games that were never originally written for stereo already look great
   in 3D with 3D Vision. Just check out our latest list of supported
   games!

   Lots of games need no modification, but there are simple things that
   developers can do to make the experience really fantastic - and a few
   stumbling blocks that developers can avoid to ensure that their game
   plays well.

How Does It Work?

   The NVIDIA 3D Vision products supports the leading 3D products
   available on the market, including 120Hz desktop LCD monitors, 3D
   projectors, and DLP HDTVs (complete list of supported displays). The
   NVIDIA 3D Vision driver can process any game to support all of these
   displays, so specifics of the display are isolated from the application
   and game developers don't need to worry about the details. The 3D
   Vision driver architecture even supports HDMI 1.4 3D TVs using NVIDIA
   3DTV Play software.

   Inside the driver, each 3D scene gets rendered twice - once for the
   left eye, and once for the right eye. The driver is able to
   automatically modify typical 3D game vertex shaders “in flight” so that
   it can generate the correct images at run time. User options allow
   players to adjust settings like inter-ocular distance (that is, the
   amount of “depth”) to their own preference. Developers can explicitly
   control the stereo aspects of the experience, or just let the driver do
   its job.

   For the best experience, of course, there are a few simple steps that a
   developer can take to ensure that their game plays its best with 3D
   Vision, including making sure that player HUD elements are displayed at
   screen depth, that UI's like crosshair reticules show in depth
   correctly (screen reticules can be confusing, but laser sights look
   *incredible* in 3D, as do projectile ballistics!), and that
   render-to-texture passes follow a few simple rules (that most
   developers already follow without realizing it).

   With a little more effort, developers can take the reins to control
   their own 3D stereo experiences, altering subtle player-attention
   controls like dynamic convergence or adding startling out-of-the-screen
   special effects.

Automatic Mixed Precision for Deep Learning

Automatic Mixed Precision for Deep Learning

   Deep Neural Network training has traditionally relied on IEEE
   single-precision format, however with mixed precision, you can train
   with half precision while maintaining the network accuracy achieved
   with single precision. This technique of using both single- and
   half-precision representations is referred to as mixed precision
   technique.

Benefits of Mixed precision training

     Speeds up math-intensive operations, such as linear and convolution
   layers, by using Tensor Cores.

     Speeds up memory-limited operations by accessing half the bytes
   compared to single-precision.

     Reduces memory requirements for training models, enabling larger
   models or larger minibatches.

     Nuance Research advances and applies conversational AI technologies
     to power solutions that redefine how humans and computers interact.
     The rate of our advances reflects the speed at which we train and
     assess deep learning models. With Automatic Mixed Precision, we’ve
     realized a 50% speedup in TensorFlow-based ASR model training
     without loss of accuracy via a minimal code change. We’re eager to
     achieve a similar impact in our other deep learning language
     processing applications.
     Wenxuan Teng, Senior Research Manager, Nuance Communications

   Enabling mixed precision involves two steps: porting the model to use
   the half-precision data type where appropriate; and using loss scaling
   to preserve small gradient values.

   The automatic mixed precision feature in TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet
   provides deep learning researcher and engineers with AI training
   speedups of up to 3X on NVIDIA Volta and Turing GPUs with adding just a
   few lines of code.

                                     amp

Using Automatic Mixed Precision for Major Deep Learning Frameworks

TensorFlow

   Automatic Mixed Precision feature is available both in native
   TensorFlow and inside the TensorFlow container on NVIDIA NGC container
   registry:

   export TF_ENABLE_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION=1

   As an alternative, the environment variable can be set inside the
   TensorFlow Python script:

   os.environ['TF_ENABLE_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION'] = '1'

   Automatic mixed precision applies both of these steps, automatic
   casting and automatic loss scaling, internally in TensorFlow with a
   single environment variable, along with more fine-grained control when
   necessary.

   Additionally, for NGC TensorFlow 19.07 or later, and native TensorFlow
   1.14 or later, an explicit optimizer wrapper is available:

   opt = tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite(opt)

     “TensorFlow developers will greatly benefit from NVIDIA automatic
     mixed precision feature. This easy integration enables them to get
     up to 3X higher performance with mixed precision training on NVIDIA
     Tensor Core GPUs while maintaining model accuracy.”

     — Rajat Monga, Engineering Director, TensorFlow, Google

     “Automated mixed precision powered by NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs on
     Alibaba allows us to instantly speedup AI models nearly 3X. Our
     researchers appreciated the ease of turning on this feature to
     instantly accelerate our AI.”

CUDA Zone

   CUDA® is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed
   by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs).
   With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing
   applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.

   In GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of the workload
   runs on the CPU – which is optimized for single-threaded performance –
   while the compute intensive portion of the application runs on
   thousands of GPU cores in parallel. When using CUDA, developers program
   in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Python and MATLAB and
   express parallelism through extensions in the form of a few basic
   keywords.

   The CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA provides everything you need to develop
   GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA Toolkit includes GPU-accelerated
   libraries, a compiler, development tools and the CUDA runtime.

   CUDA serves as a common platform across all NVIDIA GPU families so you
   can deploy and scale your application across GPU configurations.

   The first GPUs were designed as graphics accelerators, becoming more
   programmable over the 90s, culminating in NVIDIA's first GPU in 1999.
   Researchers and scientists rapidly began to apply the excellent
   floating point performance of this GPU for general purpose computing.
   In 2003, a team of researchers led by Ian Buck unveiled Brook, the
   first widely adopted programming model to extend C with data-parallel
   constructs. Ian Buck later joined NVIDIA and led the launch of CUDA in
   2006, the world's first solution for general-computing on GPUs.

   Since its inception, the CUDA ecosystem has grown rapidly to include
   software development tools, services and partner-based solutions. The
   CUDA Toolkit includes libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a
   compiler and a runtime library to deploy your application. You'll also
   find code samples, programming guides, user manuals, API references and
   other documentation to help you get started.

3D Vision and Surround Technology

   Imagine immersing yourself in the world of 3D content like never
   before. Monsters, bullets, and landscapes jump out of your flat monitor
   and into your imagination, making you part of the game. With NVIDIA® 3D
   Vision, gaming will never be the same.

   2011 is a big year for 3D entertainment, with blockbuster 3D film
   releases, brand new 3D HDTVs, and expanding the 3D Vision technologies
   that make stereoscopic 3D for home users an inexpensive and
   high-quality option.

   What surprises most game developers is just how little they may have to
   do to fully 3D in the games they are making. In fact, many shipping
   games that were never originally written for stereo already look great
   in 3D with 3D Vision. Just check out our latest list of supported
   games!

   Lots of games need no modification, but there are simple things that
   developers can do to make the experience really fantastic - and a few
   stumbling blocks that developers can avoid to ensure that their game
   plays well.

How Does It Work?

   The NVIDIA 3D Vision products supports the leading 3D products
   available on the market, including 120Hz desktop LCD monitors, 3D
   projectors, and DLP HDTVs (complete list of supported displays). The
   NVIDIA 3D Vision driver can process any game to support all of these
   displays, so specifics of the display are isolated from the application
   and game developers don't need to worry about the details. The 3D
   Vision driver architecture even supports HDMI 1.4 3D TVs using NVIDIA
   3DTV Play software.

   Inside the driver, each 3D scene gets rendered twice - once for the
   left eye, and once for the right eye. The driver is able to
   automatically modify typical 3D game vertex shaders “in flight” so that
   it can generate the correct images at run time. User options allow
   players to adjust settings like inter-ocular distance (that is, the
   amount of “depth”) to their own preference. Developers can explicitly
   control the stereo aspects of the experience, or just let the driver do
   its job.

   For the best experience, of course, there are a few simple steps that a
   developer can take to ensure that their game plays its best with 3D
   Vision, including making sure that player HUD elements are displayed at
   screen depth, that UI's like crosshair reticules show in depth
   correctly (screen reticules can be confusing, but laser sights look
   *incredible* in 3D, as do projectile ballistics!), and that
   render-to-texture passes follow a few simple rules (that most
   developers already follow without realizing it).

   With a little more effort, developers can take the reins to control
   their own 3D stereo experiences, altering subtle player-attention
   controls like dynamic convergence or adding startling out-of-the-screen
   special effects.

Automatic Mixed Precision for Deep Learning

Automatic Mixed Precision for Deep Learning

   Deep Neural Network training has traditionally relied on IEEE
   single-precision format, however with mixed precision, you can train
   with half precision while maintaining the network accuracy achieved
   with single precision. This technique of using both single- and
   half-precision representations is referred to as mixed precision
   technique.

Benefits of Mixed precision training

     Speeds up math-intensive operations, such as linear and convolution
   layers, by using Tensor Cores.

     Speeds up memory-limited operations by accessing half the bytes
   compared to single-precision.

     Reduces memory requirements for training models, enabling larger
   models or larger minibatches.

     Nuance Research advances and applies conversational AI technologies
     to power solutions that redefine how humans and computers interact.
     The rate of our advances reflects the speed at which we train and
     assess deep learning models. With Automatic Mixed Precision, we’ve
     realized a 50% speedup in TensorFlow-based ASR model training
     without loss of accuracy via a minimal code change. We’re eager to
     achieve a similar impact in our other deep learning language
     processing applications.
     Wenxuan Teng, Senior Research Manager, Nuance Communications

   Enabling mixed precision involves two steps: porting the model to use
   the half-precision data type where appropriate; and using loss scaling
   to preserve small gradient values.

   The automatic mixed precision feature in TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet
   provides deep learning researcher and engineers with AI training
   speedups of up to 3X on NVIDIA Volta and Turing GPUs with adding just a
   few lines of code.

                                     amp

Using Automatic Mixed Precision for Major Deep Learning Frameworks

TensorFlow

   Automatic Mixed Precision feature is available both in native
   TensorFlow and inside the TensorFlow container on NVIDIA NGC container
   registry:

   export TF_ENABLE_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION=1

   As an alternative, the environment variable can be set inside the
   TensorFlow Python script:

   os.environ['TF_ENABLE_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION'] = '1'

   Automatic mixed precision applies both of these steps, automatic
   casting and automatic loss scaling, internally in TensorFlow with a
   single environment variable, along with more fine-grained control when
   necessary.

   Additionally, for NGC TensorFlow 19.07 or later, and native TensorFlow
   1.14 or later, an explicit optimizer wrapper is available:

   opt = tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite(opt)

     “TensorFlow developers will greatly benefit from NVIDIA automatic
     mixed precision feature. This easy integration enables them to get
     up to 3X higher performance with mixed precision training on NVIDIA
     Tensor Core GPUs while maintaining model accuracy.”

     — Rajat Monga, Engineering Director, TensorFlow, Google

     “Automated mixed precision powered by NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs on
     Alibaba allows us to instantly speedup AI models nearly 3X. Our
     researchers appreciated the ease of turning on this feature to
     instantly accelerate our AI.”

ROBOT ENGINE

   The Isaac Robot Engine is a software framework to easily build modular
   robotics applications. It enables high-performance data processing and
   deep learning for intelligent robots. Robotics applications developed
   on Isaac Robot Engine can seamlessly run on edge devices like the
   NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Xavier™ and NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™, as well as on a
   workstation with a discrete NVIDIA® GPU.

   Entity-Component Architecture
     * The Robot Engine allows developers to break down a complex robotics
       use case into smaller building blocks.
     * Customize Isaac SDK features to fit your use case by configuring
       pre-packaged components.
     * Easily add new features by developing custom components.
     * Other capabilities include experimental message recording and
       replay of sensor data or message passing over network sockets.

   Computational Graph
     * Applications consist of multiple nodes and use inter-node
       communication to exchange data between them.
     * Avoid host-device memory copies and increase the performance of
       your application by attaching CUDA buffer objects to messages.
     * Group nodes into subgraphs and effectively combine them into a
       robotics application.

   Visualization
     * The Isaac Robot Engine also comes with a customizable visualization
       framework to create visualization for variable plots, drawings,
       camera image overlays, or 3D scenes.
     * Developers can use Isaac WebSight to inspect and debug their
       robotics application in a web browser.

   Advanced Build System
     * Isaac SDK uses Bazel for tracking dependencies, building source
       code, testing and packaging of robotics applications.
     * Automatically pull external dependencies such as OpenCV, ROS or
       other robotics open source libraries.
     * Partners can create their own workspaces to add sensor support or
       new algorithms to Isaac SDK. An example is available on GitHub
