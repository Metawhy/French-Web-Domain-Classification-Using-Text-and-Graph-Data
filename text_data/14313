   parc omega entrance

     Parc Omega, located in the beautiful Outaouais region of Quebec, is a
   total gem for getting up close and personal with some of Canada's
   favourite animals!    We received complimentary passes for Parc Omega,
   however, all opinions expressed are my own.   This summer we took the
   boys on a week long road trip to Ottawa and Quebec. After three days in
   the nation's capitol learning all about our parliament, eating beaver
   tails and exploring museums, we started to … [Read more...]

   hyperstrike

     These outdoor toys for summer will have the kids smiling instead of
   groaning about going out to play! I belong to a number of parenting
   groups for moms with boys on facebook, often I hear moms complaining
   about getting their boys (especially the pre-teen aged ones) off their
   electronics and out the door to play. They are not alone, most of the
   other moms, including myself agree. Long gone are the days of our own
   youth where we indulged in outdoor play with friends from around the …

   grilled pizza

     During the warmer months, everyone knows that the BBQ can be your
   best friend. Grilling up a tasty meal can be the best way to get a
   quick dinner on the table during a busy weeknight, or entertain a
   larger group of family and friends on the weekend. Finding
   easy-to-prepare but healthy recipes can be a lifesaver, especially when
   the family is busy with outdoor activities, sports or just hanging out
   having fun. Did you know that Canadian turkey’s low-fat, high-protein
   content makes it … [Read more...]
