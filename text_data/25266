Random Family Genealogy

   Jeff has done a fantastic job of chronicling our genealogy*, uncovering
   many generations of ancestors for the both of us.  Sometimes I'll sit
   in bed next to him while he searches, reading the screen of his laptop
   over his shoulder, names like Mattie Floenda, Ernst Heinrich, Martha
   Jane.  Poetic, meaningful names.  Each of these people lived long
   enough to procreate and eventually create us, our family.  Think on it
   too long and it starts to fry my brain.
   I've seen all kinds of methods to display the family tree.  But none
   that I've ever wanted to put on the wall.
   So I made my own.  One that focuses on the names, but without all that
   pesky organization.
   100OLYMP_P9170429
   Basically, I used a Tag Cloud generator to display the names, which
   shows the most common as the largest sizes.  You'll notice that we have
   lots of Marys, Williams, Sarahs and Johns.
   Shocking, huh.
   Geneology Background
   (Here's the original file that I had printed up at Costco.)
   Geneology- All Names- 500 Edwardian Script3 copy
   (And this is a close up of the top right corner to give some
   perspective.  Some of those names are pretty tiny, so you'll find
   people standing right up close to scan them.  It usually turns into a
   strange little game of Eye-Spy.)
   Helpful Skills:
     * If you are already familiar with creating tag clouds, that's about
       all you need to know.  Go forth and make your own.
     * Basic photo editing knowledge.

   Tips: (as usual, I have quite a few, many learned the hard way)
     * I use Tagxedo because it allows me to control quite a bit of the
       style and design and also because it can save a pretty huge file,
       large enough to print, which is kind of the whole point.
     * When entering data, you can keep two words together by adding a ~
       between them (eg: Catherine~Ann).  I only did this when I wanted a
       first and middle name to stay together, not between first and last
       names.  The reason being that I wanted all of the first and last
       names displayed separately, with their size calculated
       independently of one another.
     * I suggest you create a separate text document to save your list of
       names.  Tagxedo doesn't have the ability to save your progress if
       you want to leave and come back to it (or accidentally click the
       back button on your browser, heh hem- don't ask me how I know this
       one).  I'd also write down what colors, fonts, etc you like for
       that same reason.
     * You can use any of the shapes available. Though I chose a simple
       rectangle that they provided, which I was able to print up to about
       15x28 inches.  Joey thought the banana gave it a modern flair.
       Heh.

   Geneology- Banana
     * You can even create your own two-toned picture and upload that for
       the shape, which is helpful if you'd like create a specific ratio
       for a standard frame size.  In fact, I've made some standard sizes
       for you to use if you aren't comfortable creating your own.

     * 8x10
     * 11x14
     * 16x20
     * 18x24
     * 20x30
     * 22x28
     * 24x30
     * 24x36

     You can use any fonts that you have already loaded on your computer
   by clicking Use Local Fonts.

     Futz around with the colors and fonts to your heart's content,
   respinning the effects again and again, but if you see something you
   like, go ahead and save it to your computer because once you spin it,
   you won't end up with exactly the same thing again.  There is a history
   button, but it won't hold that for too long.  Personally, I had more
   than a dozen different versions as I worked my way through the changes,
   making note of the specifics in the titles of each.

     You can even change the characteristics of a particular name (or
   names) to highlight them.  These would be great for births, weddings
   and anniversaries.  Basically you type the word (or words) followed by
   the modifiers.  Separate each modifier with a : and don't use any
   spaces.  They can be in any order.
     * Jeffrey~Gwendolyn [this sticks the words together]
     * Jeffrey~Gwendolyn:50 [this makes them larger] Try using different
       numbers to adjust the size.
     * Jeffrey~Gwendolyn :50: @0 [this makes them larger and at an angle
       of zero degrees or horizontal]
     * Jeffrey~Gwendolyn:50:@0:#339999 [this makes them larger, horizontal
       and turquoise]  You can find a list of colors and their codes here.
     * Jeffrey~Gwendolyn:50:@0:#33999:!Goudy!Old!Style [this makes them
       larger, horizontal, turquoise and changes their font to Goudy Old
       Style]
     * For more details, check out the Tagxedo Blog.

   Geneology- Jeff and Wendy- Edwardian, Red Tops, 380, no replication,
   Goudy Old Style
     * The Theme is where you chose color sets.  This is "Red Tops" and my
       original one was "Sunset on Watert".
     * If you're curious, the script that I used for most of these is
       Edwardian Script ITC, which I had local on my computer.
     * Save the picture by clicking Save/ Share/ Print and under the Image
       tab, choosing the biggest jpg you can, 16MP.
     * After I saved the file, I opened it in Photoshop and cropped it
       down to the appropriate size, with a resolution of 300 pixels/inch.
        (If you don't have Photoshop, you can find lots of free photo
       editing tools online.)  This will save you much grief when you go
       to order the print.
     * When cropping, I also removed the tagxedo.com mark and border.  I
       did this because 1) I was putting this on my wall as art and didn't
       want a url mucking up the design and 2) I promoted it
       on facebook and donated to the creator of the software here.
     * I was able to get this printed up as a poster at Costco for less
       than ten bucks.
     * For this one, I cut the matboard to size myself and left it
       unframed.  But you may want to make sure to upload a shape that has
       a common ratio for frames.

   *I would just like to confess that when writing this post, I did not
   spell this word correctly one time.  I kept trying to type "geneology".
    There, I feel much better.

Buster's Tie

   *Photo and caption courtesy of Joey.  Well, I guess wardrobe is also
   Joey's doing.  It's not as if Buster gets up in the morning and puts
   this tie on himself.  Though he really doesn't seem to mind it.  It's
   attached with velcro at the back and he'll just wear it around for
   hours before he somehow pulls it off.
   And when he walks into a room while he's wearing it, all nonchalant, it
   is hilarious.  You keep expecting him to put down his briefcase and
   complain about work.  It gives the impression that he hasn't spent the
   entire day sleeping and licking his ass.  Which he totally has.

Nuvia's Appetizers: aka Jalapeno Spicy Stuff

   After trying these strange little appetizers at a party, the kids now
   insist that we have them as an after school snack fairly often.  They
   love them. Which isn't to say that only strange little kids (as ours
   clearly are) will like them.  Most adults do as well.  That is despite
   the fact that the combination seems pretty unappetizing (forgive the
   pun).
   I promise you, these are worth trying.
   IMG_5479
    And my nephew,  Kam, was super excited to show the internet how to
   make them.

   IFRAME: http://www.youtube.com/embed/4E37Ln97dhQ?rel=0

   So we made this little video.  For you. (You'll need colby cheese,
   pickled jalapenos and red grapes.)
   It's slightly more informative than the last tutorial that Kam made
   three years ago for making frogs out of gumpaste.

   IFRAME: http://www.youtube.com/embed/uydmS074Z28?rel=0

   I think he might have a future in this.

Vegetable Grafting

   Early this spring I discovered a gardening technique that I had never
   heard of before.  I'm sure most of you know about grafting with trees,
   but did you know you could do it with vegetables too?  Tomato grafting
   allows you to combine the best characteristics of two types of plants
   into one.
   IMG_5534
    I read about it over at A Way to Garden and I totally geeked out.  Two
   parts of my personality, the avid gardener and the nerdy biologist,
   were jumping up and down inside my head.

   Most gardeners are well aware of the tomato blight, viruses that are
   destroying tomatoes around the country.  And it's also true that
   heirloom tomatoes, the best tasting kind, in my opinion, are
   particularly susceptible.  Really, that's one of the reasons why they
   started breeding hybrids, to make them more resistant to these
   viruses.  The problem is that hybrids don't taste as good as the
   heirlooms.
   So what to do?
   Armed with a razor blade and a silicone clip, you can take two
   seedlings and combine them into one super tomato plant via razor blade
   surgery.  One seedling should be disease-resistant and prolific.  This
   becomes the rootstock (the bottom half) and controls overall how the
   plant grows.  The other seedling should produce fruit that taste really
   yummy.  This becomes the scion (the top half) and controls what the
   fruit look and tastes like.
   It really is just about that simple.  In theory.
   IMG_5544
   I especially like this picture (above) because it shows how the
   rootstock on the bottom is attempting to grow itself some leaves while
   the scion on the top is attempting to grow its own set of roots.  All
   of these will need to be pulled off to keep that from happening.  If
   these were allowed to grow, it would ruin all the hard work, producing
   grodey hybrid fruit and reducing the disease resistance of the plant.
   I actually managed to create 6 successfully grafted plants on the first
   go.  I felt a bit like a mad scientist during this entire endeavor and
   may or may not have had the words, "It's Alive!" go through my mind
   every so often.
   I started with 12 seeds of Maxifort for the rootstock, which is
   resistant to F2 (Fusarium Wilt 1 and 2), N (Nematodes), TMV (Tobacco
   Mosaic Virus), V (Verticillium Wilt), PL (Corky Root Rot) and FOR
   (Fusarium Crown and Root Rot).  I also started 6 each of Brandywine and
   Ace (These were the heirloom seeds that I already happened to have).
   With Jeff's help, I grafted 7 plants total.  One of which came apart
   after the first day and started growing quite an impressive set of
   leaves from the rootstock.  (I won't be planting this one.)
   IMG_5538
   The silicone clip fell off of this guy (below) early on, but the two
   parts somehow managed to stay close enough together to fuse.  It's
   definitely less pretty than the others that were held closer together,
   but I still think it's amazing.
   IMG_5505
   I won't go into the specifics right now as I am miles away from being
   any sort of authority on the subject.  Though I do promise to include
   more info as I figure it out.  I basically followed the instructions in
   this video for the top grafting, not the side grafting that he starts
   out explaining.

   IFRAME: http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSwTCwlhFgo?rel=0

   Oh, I almost forgot.  I have seen grafted tomato plants for sale at a
   nursery or two around town.  They were running about $12 for a gallon
   size.  So depending on how many you want to grow, this might be a more
   economical solution for you.

Mini Murals

   I finished another little painting in Joey's room.  This one is from Lu
   and the Swamp Ghost, written by, strangely enough, James Carville.
   IMG_4530
   I've done quite a few of these over the years.  Luckily, Joey's still
   excited to come home from school and see that I've finished another
   one.
   IMG_4310
   IMG_4312
   All of the mini murals I've done come from her favorite storybooks.
   IMG_5405
   I scanned the pictures, played with them in photoshop to show as much
   of the basic outline as possible (I think I used the stamp effect), and
   then printed them up on overhead projector sheets.  You can cram quite
   a few of them on each one.
   IMG_4551
   Then I projected them onto the wall and traced them in pencil.
   IMG_4661
   You can barely see the penciled versions unless you're right up close.
   That way, I can finish them when I have time. Though this technique may
   have given me way too much time, since I've been working on this
   project for like ever.  And there are still more pencil drawings than
   finished paintings.
   Our favorite part is deciding where to put everybody.
   IMG_5407
   Like this little guy who is in the corner, behind the door.
   IMG_5419
   And this bunch who are all hanging from a long rope I painted in.
   I use plain ol' acrylic craft paints, thinned with water, letting it
   dry between coats (sometimes speeding things with a blow dryer).  This
   allows me to more easily do shading on the sort of difficult pieces.  I
   traced quite a few of them at the end with a super thin, black marker.
   IMG_5416
   The Wild Things' hair and scales were done mostly with the marker.  It
   gives you a lot more control that way.
