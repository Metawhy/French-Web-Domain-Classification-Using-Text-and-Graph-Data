       Hey all you wonderful ladies and gentlemen at WayForward!
       I quick question. I donâ€™t suppose thereâ€™s a way to get a 1920Ã—1080
       resolution of this amazing piece of art from the latest Pirateâ€™s
       Curse trailer?
       enter image description here
       I have the great wallpaper art that was a reward for backing 1/2
       Genie Hero and this particular piece of art would go perfectly
       beside it on my other monitor! =D

       Sorry, youâ€™ll have to settle for 1280Ã—720 version for now. But it
       looks great even when stretched. ðŸ˜‰

       Better than the tiny versions I was finding. Still hoping for a
       nice 1080p res one day, but this will do very nicely in the
       meantime. Thanks a bunch! =D

       wall paper?

       That would be hilarious if there was a bigger image of that but
       unfortunately thatâ€™s just as big as they come. ðŸ™‚

       There is a 1080p version of that image as a backer reward. iâ€™d post
       it but donâ€™t want to burn wayforward.

       Thanks very much for the 1280Ã—720 image! I decided to enlarge it to
       1920 x 1080 and clean up a few of the more noticeable jpeg
       artifacts (mainly in the purple highlights of her hair) and the
       image still looks pretty good. If I had more time, Iâ€™d edit the
       artifacts a bit more, but for now itâ€™s definitely workable as an HD
       wallpaper. : )

       I found a 1280Ã—720 version of the image on tumblr. And another
       promotional image over at GoNintendo. I donâ€™t know if that helps.

       Come on guys, itâ€™s not that hard. (png version)
       (although i did mess up the input YUV levels (which is why itâ€™s
       more contrasted/saturated) but it looks alright so whatever)
       But then again I do have about five years worth of tinkering with
       things like this so heh.

   [Item Spoiler/Vita Bug] Bug/glitch at Cape Crustacean

       Iâ€™ve encountered a bug/glitch in the PSVita Version ( otherwise
       have had a fantastic time playing ), and I have been able to
       replicate it at least 5 times in succession. The place in question
       is the dark course inside the airships to get the Spider Venom
       power-up. The glitch,l however, didnâ€™t start occuring until after I
       got the Bat Sonar at Hypno Baronâ€™s Castle. Dying at any point of
       the start of the darkened spike course would cause Shantae to not
       appear when spawning, and then upon using a magic spell, sheâ€™d zip
       over to inside a wall in the flooded room with a chest ( which I
       still havenâ€™t figure out how to get to the chest irritatingly
       <.<;;). Like said, Iâ€™ve replicated the glitch successfully five
       different times due to it being a really challenging challenge
       room. Each time in order to get unstuck Iâ€™d have to use the bird
       whistle to have Wrench pick me up and then start the level over (
       although thatâ€™s not too terrible seeing as Warp Dance makes it easy
       to get back to at least inside the airship ).
       Wondering if anyone else has had this bug/glitch.
