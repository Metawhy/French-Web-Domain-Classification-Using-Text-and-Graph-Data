Product safety and compliance in our store

   Safety is a top priority at Amazon. Products in our store must comply
   with relevant laws and regulations and our sophisticated tools prevent
   non-compliant products from being listed.

   on August 23, 2019

   In response to a Wall Street Journal story about the safety of products
   offered in our store, we're sharing information about our
   industry-leading safety and compliance program.

   Amazon strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, where
   people can find and discover the widest possible selection of safe and
   authentic goods, and we work hard to earn and maintain your trust. In
   2018 alone, we invested over $400 million to protect our store and our
   customers and built robust programs to ensure products offered are
   safe, compliant, and authentic.

   Amazon offers customers hundreds of millions of items, and we have
   developed, and continuously refine and improve, our tools that prevent
   suspicious, unsafe, or non-compliant products from being listed in our
   store.

   Our proactive measures begin when a seller attempts to open an account.
   Our new seller account vetting includes a number of verifications and
   uses proprietary machine learning technology that stops bad actors
   before they can register or list a single product in our store. All
   products offered in our stores must comply with applicable laws and
   regulations, and our own policies. For example, we require toys to be
   tested to relevant safety standards set by the Consumer Product Safety
   Commission. We have a dedicated global team of compliance specialists
   that review submitted safety documentation, and we have additional
   qualification requirements that sellers must meet to offer products. In
   2018, our teams and technologies proactively blocked more than three
   billion suspect listings for various forms of abuse, including
   non-compliance, before they were published to our store.

   Once a product is available in our store, we continuously scan our
   product listings and updates to find products that might present a
   concern. Every few minutes, our tools review the hundreds of millions
   of products, scan the more than five billion daily changes to product
   detail pages, and analyze the tens of millions of customer reviews that
   are submitted weekly for signs of a concern and investigate
   accordingly. Our tools use natural language processing and machine
   learning, which means new information is fed into our tools daily so
   they can learn and constantly get better at proactively blocking
   suspicious products.

   In addition, we provide a number of ways for regulatory agencies,
   industry organizations, brands, customers, and our customer service
   teams to report safety issues. When we receive these reports, we move
   quickly to protect customers, remove unsafe products from our store,
   and investigate. For example, if a customer reports a concern with a
   product, a customer service associate can instantly trigger an
   investigation. Additionally, because of our direct relationships with
   customers, we are able to trace and directly notify customers who
   purchased a particular product online and alert them to a potential
   safety issue—our systems are far more effective than other online and
   offline retailers and customers can feel confident they’ll have the
   information they need.

   We also regularly work with agencies including the Food and Drug
   Administration and Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the
   information we share helps them identify trends and develop
   regulations. We are active in industry working groups and committees
   that are dedicated to developing new solutions and guidelines that will
   benefit all retailers and consumers.

   We invest significant resources to protect our customers and have built
   robust programs designed to ensure products offered for sale in our
   store are safe and compliant. We want customers to shop with confidence
   and if ever a customer has a concern, they can contact our customer
   service team, and we will investigate.

   Services.

       09/25/19
       And with that, the Amazon Devices & Services Event is coming to a
       close. As you can see, the team has been incredibly busy over the
       past year. We’re very excited to share these new products and get
       them to customers to see if they love them as much as we do.
     * 11:24 AM
       09/25/19
       Echo Frames and Echo Loop will be available in limited volumes by
       invite only. The invite price reflects our desire to get feedback
       from customers. Echo Frames will be available for a special price
       of $179.99 during the invite period. Echo Loop will be $129.99
       during the invite period. Both will begin shipping later this year.
     * 11:23 AM

       The second Day 1 Edition product is called Echo Loop. It’s an
       Alexa-enabled smart ring packed with ways to stay on top of your
       day. It has 2 microphones activated by a button tap. With Echo
       Loop, you'll have more information at your finger tips - literally.

       grocery store.
         ______________________________________________________________

       Echo Loop has two-microphones, the smallest speaker ever on an Echo
       device, and a haptic engine that vibrates discreetly when you
       receive notifications or an incoming call, or to signal that the
       button has been pressed and Alexa is streaming your request to the
       cloud. It’s a ton of technology packed into this small form factor.
       Paired with your phone, this ring lets you access information
       throughout the day. It’s super easy to connect with Alexa without
       breaking stride or digging out your phone, for those simple things
       like turning on the lights or calculating the tip on your lunch
       bill. Simply press a button talk softly to Alexa and then the
       answer comes discretely through a small speaker built into the
       ring.
     * 11:21 AM
       09/25/19
       The first Day One Edition product is Echo Frames - Alexa-enabled
       glasses that let you get more done and be more present. They look
       like regular prescription glasses (without a prescription, but you
       can add one), and they’re comfortable, weighing only 31 grams.
       They don’t have a camera or display to get in the way—they’re all
       about all-day access to Alexa on-the-go while keeping your hands,
       ears, and eyes free to engage with the world around you.

       Customers do wonder how we launch new products.
       So today we’re launching Day 1 Editions, a new way for us to get
       new products out in limited volume, to customers, and to get real
       feedback—and if customers love them, we’ll double down and build a
       lot more.
     * 11:18 AM
       09/25/19
       Echo Buds are helpful in so many ways, including shopping. We
       worked with the Whole Foods team to make this experience really
       delightful in store. For example, you'll be able to ask Alexa if
       Whole Foods has canned tomatoes in stock as well as where you can
       find canned tomatoes.
       Echo Buds are available for pre-order starting today for $129.99
       and will start shipping in October.
     * 11:17 AM
       09/25/19
       When talking with customers, something came back consistently.
       Easy-to-use noise reduction was critical. We're excited to be
       working with Bose to incorporate Bose Active Noise Reduction
       technology into Echo Buds for customers.
       To help you navigate your everyday life, with a double tap, you can
       turn on and off the noise reduction for pass through mode if you
       want to clearly hear the world around you.
       You can also tap and hold to access your phone’s voice services
       like Siri or Google Assistant.
     * 11:16 AM
       09/25/19
       Meet Echo Buds, the first Echo wearable to offer customers
       hands-free access to Alexa, on-the-go. When we set out to build
       Echo Buds, we looked at what customers would want from earbuds.
       Excellent sound. To do that, each earbud has two premium, balanced
       armature drivers, inspired by those used by professional musicians.
       These deliver crisp, clear vocals, and dynamic bass.
       Echo Buds have 5 hours of battery life with just the earbuds and up
       to 20 hours of battery life with the case.

       But, customers tell us that they want Alexa to be with them
       everywhere - not only at home and in the car.

       Today we’re excited to announce a General Motors Alexa integration.
       GM is the first automaker to deliver a fully embedded Alexa
       experience based on the Alexa Auto SDK, and the breadth: Alexa will
       be available on millions of vehicles across all four GM brands –
       Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. The best part is that this
       isn’t just about brand new vehicles. It’ll also be available to
       millions of existing vehicles on the road with a simple
       over-the-air update.

         ______________________________________________________________

     * 11:13 AM
       09/25/19
       When we looked to bring Alexa beyond the home, the obvious place
       for us to start was in the car. We’ve spent the last few years
       making Alexa available in more and more vehicles, whether it’s
       through Echo Auto, or through integrations with auto makers like
       Audi, BMW, Ford, and Toyota.
     * 11:12 AM
       09/25/19
       We will be publishing this protocol and allowing the Sidewalk
       network to be used by things we and other developers make to do
       secure, over-the-air updates to ensure the software is up to date,
       one of the biggest problems we face with the Internet of Things.
       It is very early days but we are so excited to see what developers
       will invent using Sidewalk.
     * 11:12 AM
       09/25/19
       As the Sidewalk network grows, it will be useful for keeping track
       of things. And what better to track than the family dog?
       We’re going to build a reference design called Ring Fetch - a dog
       tracker that will use Sidewalk and ping you if your dog leaves a
       certain perimeter. This will be coming next year.
       New Ring devices
         ______________________________________________________________

     * 11:11 AM
       09/25/19
       As we got to building this idea of this network, we learned that,
       with just a few access points, very broad coverage becomes
       available.
       We went to Ring HQ to test a few devices, and asked the team how
       long it would take to get an Amazon Sidewalk network up and
       running. We sent 700 devices out to employees, friends, and family,
       and three weeks later, we had the LA Basin - the second largest
       city in the country - completely covered in three weeks. Because it
       has such good overlap and range, you get great coverage.
     * 11:10 AM
       09/25/19
       We came up with a concept we call Amazon Sidewalk.
       A low bandwidth, highly secure network, that uses the free 900 MHz
       spectrum to first and foremost extend the distance at which you can
       control simple, low-cost, edge IoT devices.
       We think developers will build all kinds of useful, low-cost
       products for this network. We started with the obvious use case of
       lighting with Ring's smart lighting, but think about all the things
       that are far from your home WiFi that might use Sidewalk—weather
       stations to tell you how much rain you’ve gotten, a water sensor in
       your garden with your tomatoes, a little sensor in your mailbox
       that lets you know when the mail has been delivered. The
       possibilities are endless.
     * 11:09 AM
       09/25/19
       One of the things we learned from the Alexa Connect Kit is that
       developers are always looking for new ways to invent for their
       customers, and that includes pushing the boundaries outside the
       home. But when we do that, real technology problems come into play.
       Bluetooth has limited range. WiFi only goes so far. And 5G cellular
       is incredibly important when you need reliable, long distance,
       guaranteed delivery of data, but it can be complex. That leaves a
       middle ground for devices that are looking for low-cost, low-power,
       low bandwidth connection where battery life needs to be measured in
       years, not days.
     * 11:08 AM
       09/25/19
       Meet the Amazon Smart Oven a combination microwave, convection
       oven, air fryer and food warmer that you can control with your
       voice using compatible Alexa-enabled devices. Just ask Alexa to
       cook common foods using dozens of presets that have been carefully
       tested and tuned. Alexa will announce when to stir the food during
       cooking and let you know when it’s finished.

       We have extended the Alexa Connect Kit in two ways. First, we added
       new multi-step capabilities so that devices can feed telemetry to
       the cloud, make new decisions about operations, and give new
       instructions to devices—so any device can keep getting smarter just
       like Alexa. Second, we introduced a new host of cooking
       capabilities like temperature, preheat your oven, and scan to cook.
       There are a few devices already that will be using this which will
       be adopting these APIs. In addition, we wanted to build a reference
       design to inspire more developers.
     * 11:06 AM
       09/25/19
       This also means that there has never been more diversity in the
       number of products that have Alexa built in, or products that use
       the Alexa Connect Kit. Last year, we introduced the AmazonBasics
       Microwave as an example of what’s possible—we are amazed that even
       as a reference design, it’s become the best-selling microwave on
       Amazon.

       None of these advancements in smart home would be possible without
       our community of developers. There are now more than 85,000
       Alexa-compatible smart home devices and more than 100,000 Alexa
       skills. There are now billions of dollars flowing through the Alexa
       economy—that’s developer only.

       And we’re adding an all new product to the lineup - the Ring Indoor
       Cam, our lowest-cost home security camera.
       It’s compact design means you can mount it just about anywhere in
       the home. It, too, has everything you love about Ring cameras, plus
       it will have those great modes I mentioned earlier so you can
       control when it records and when it’s in “Home” mode.

       version.

       Many homes have the home security box in their garage or basement,
       that's no longer in use. Tens of millions of American homes have a
       security system hub or countless other systems that are installed
       but out of use. And the last thing we want to do is sell more
       accessories that customers don’t need.
       So, we created the Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit—a DIY kit that customers
       can connect to an existing security system hub already in their
       home, so they can use the sensors previously installed in their
       home and integrate easily with Ring Alarm.
       The Alarm Hub and Retrofit Alarm Kit will be available together for
       $375.99, or just the Retrofit Alarm Kit for only $199.99. Ring
       Retrofit Alarm Kit will ship in November.

       Just over a year ago, we announced Ring Alarm, which is already the
       best-selling home security system on Amazon and at Best Buy this

       do it yourself, time and time again, it works.

       Echo Flex will be a new way to interact with Alexa, and it will
       also be a great sensor for a Ring home security system.
       Ring’s mission has been, from the beginning, about making homes and
       neighborhoods safer. In the 18 months since Ring became part of the
       Amazon family, Ring continues to protect millions of customers with
       more than 4 billion interactions per month.
       And we continue to see that when you add security to neighborhoods,
       it reduces crime.

       We came up with Echo Flex, it can be placed throughout your home.
       It’s compact, cordless, and plugs right into your wall outlet.
       Echo Flex has a small speaker—similar to a cell phone—so it’s not
       optimized for music, but it is optimized for Alexa’s voice. Echo
       Flex also includes a USB charging port so you can charge your
       phone, even if you have limited outlets. But that port can also be
       used for some really fun, useful accessories.

       With features like Guard, more and more customers want Alexa to be
       available throughout their homes and they're finding the most
       creative ways to do that – they’re even 3D printing Echo mounts. We
       thought we might make it easier for them.
     * 10:58 AM
       09/25/19
       And we’re making Guard even more valuable by adding another type of
       smart alert for sounds of activity. We’ve been working on the
       science training the local model to understand what sounds are
       correlated with different activities, so when you put Alexa into
       Away mode – and only when she’s in Away mode – Alexa can notify you
       when she detected the likelihood of activity in your home.
     * 10:58 AM
       09/25/19
       First, we’re bringing Guard to Routines so when you say, “Alexa I’m
       off to work,” Alexa will switch into away mode, lock your door, and
       turn on your exterior lights, all with a simple routine.
     * 10:56 AM
       09/25/19
       We talked about making your home simpler and smarter—it’s also
       important we make the home safer.
       Over the past year, Alexa Guard has had tremendous momentum. Turn
       on Alexa Guard and she moves into a mode so you get smart alerts
       when specific sounds are detected, like broken glass like CO
       alarms. Today, we’re improving Alexa Guard in two ways.
     * 10:56 AM
       09/25/19
       The feature will be available starting on Ring Video Doorbell Elite
       next year.
     * 10:55 AM
       09/25/19
       Another way we’re making your home smarter and more proactive is by
       expanding the ways Alexa can be more conversational. At re:MARS, we
       spoke about conversational AI and the team wanted to explore how
       can we bring this to Ring Video Doorbells.
       Even though you’re connected to your doorbell all the time through
       the Ring app, maybe you don’t have you phone or you’re on a stage
       talking about doorbells. The team has been working on a doorbell
       concierge feature.

We’re introducing two new types of Alexa Hunches
       Alexa will have Hunches about things that need replacing around
       your house. That might be batteries for your smart locks and
       security cameras, printer ink and even air purifiers, and even that
       always seems to run out at the worst time possible.
       Alexa will also have Hunches about Routines that you may want to
       set up based on your daily habits.
       For example, if you set your alarm for 6 AM every day and then
       normally follow that up by asking for the weather and the score of
       the Cubs game. If you do that a few times, Alexa will understand
       and suggest that you may want to create a routine. All you have to
       do is say, “yes,” and the routine will be created.

       Certified for Humans and eero WiFi are two ways we’re making your
       home simpler. We’re also working on ways to make it smarter. One
       way is to make your home more proactive. One example of that is
       Hunches.
       We launched Hunches last year so Alexa can let you know when
       something is out of place or left undone – you left your lights on,
       your back door is unlocked. We’re making a lot of progress on this
       and getting good feedback from customers.
     * 10:52 AM
       09/25/19
       We’re excited for more customers to experience the magic of eero’s
       super simple WiFi and we want to make this experience even simpler
       through Alexa. So we taught Alexa about managing WiFi access.
       Instead of unlocking your phone and using an app, or using a
       dedicated skill, you can now say:
       “Alexa, pause the WiFi for dinner,”
       “Alexa, turn on the guest WiFi,”
       “Alexa, pause the Playstation WiFi.”
       We didn’t want to limit this feature to eero, so Alexa customers
       can use their voice to manage Wi-Fi access on compatible ASUS, and
       TP-Link routers this fall, and devices from Arris and Linksys
       starting early next year.
     * 10:51 AM
       09/25/19
       The all-new eero builds on the same simplicity and reliability of
       the eero Pro and eero Beacon lineup.
       eero’s dual band radio and TrueMesh technology combine to give you
       whole-home WiFi coverage—no more dead zones in your home.
       For additional peace of mind, customers can choose optional
       subscribtions eero Secure or eero Secure+ to safeguard the devices
       that connect to their networks.
       The all-new eero is available today in the US for $99 or $249 for a
       3-pack. And eero will be available in Europe in early November.

       Another way to make your smart home simpler is with WiFi -- and
       talking about WiFi, no one is better at this than eero -- that’s
       why we are so excited that eero became part of the Amazon family
       earlier this year. They have a mission of building the best,
       simplest, and most secure WiFi solution in the world.

       We’re starting with select smart lights, plugs, and small
       appliances. What these devices have in common is we certified them
       based on over a dozen criteria.
       A few of the criteria include:
       - The product uses Frustration Free Setup
       - They have background, silent over the air updates so the software
       is always up to date
       - Customers can set them up with the Alexa app they already have
     * 10:48 AM
       09/25/19
       To validate these products are actually easy to set up, we convened
       a non-expert panel with no geeks allowed, no IT directors. They
       tried our first group of Certified for Humans products and they
       were delighted.
     * 10:47 AM
       09/25/19
       To continue building on our Frustration Free Setup vision, we’re
       announcing Certified for Humans, a new program that identifies
       devices that are struggle-free, tinker-free, and stress-free—no
       patience needed to get these installed.
     * 10:47 AM
       09/25/19
       Let’s start with simpler. Last year, we introduced Frustration Free

       and we have sold millions of them. That’s all we need to know that
       Frustration Free Setup is on the right track for actual humans

       Another delightful thing we've seen over the past year is how much
       kids relate to smart home. They love turning the lights on, and
       off, and on, and off… They do it because it's fun and delightful.
       We wanted to make that experience easier and even more fun for
       kids.
       Introducing Echo Glow, a multi-color smart lamp that pairs with
       Alexa that we think kids are going to love.

       for playtime, a Sleep Timer that gradually dims as bedtime nears,
       or, coming soon, a dance party with music and lights. They can also
       set Echo Glow to softly cascade through all the colors of the

       customer excitement in the last year with Echo is with kids and
       families. We have a great FreeTime experience on Echo Dot, and we
       announced new colors, including our Rainbow design earlier this
       year.

       So we're excited to bring a brand new FreeTime experience to Echo
       Show.
       Just like we’ve done with FreeTime on Echo and Echo Dot, we’ve
       built this experience from the ground up with fun, educational
       content that kids love, and parental controls that give you peace
       of mind. And, we don’t do this work alone. We work closely with the
       Family Online Safety Institute, and other leading industry groups
       to ensure the experience is great for both kids and parents.
       Now, the millions of families that have FreeTime will be able to
       watch kid-friendly videos, make video calls with parent-approved
       contacts, and add fun stickers to photos. And, we think kids will
       love the addition of music lyrics on the screen for sing-a-long
       parties.

       experience for their families.

       Earlier today, Discovery, Inc. and Food Network announced a new
       cooking product – Food Network Kitchen – and we're thrilled to
       announce Alexa is their exclusive voice service.
       Customers will be able to watch live and on-demand episodes of Food
       Network TV shows on Echo Show - and when they see a recipe they
       like, they can just ask Alexa to save that recipe. Additionally,
       subscribers will be able to watch live and on-demand cooking
       classes from Food Network's lineup of world-class chefs like Alton
       Brown or Giada.
       To make the experience even more delightful, we worked closely with
       the teams so that when you're viewing a recipe, Alexa knows the
       context and details, so you can ask questions about needed
       ingredients and more to make sure you have everything you need.

       created Alexa Guest Connect. Now, when you get to a property with
       an Echo device, you can say, "Alexa, connect my account" and the
       feature will authenticate the request on both ends and you'll be
       able to access your favorite playlists.

Introducing the all-new Amazon Echo
       The all-new Echo inherits the same audio architecture as Echo Plus,
       including neodymium drivers, 3-inch woofer and increased back
       volume so the bass feels stronger, and the mids and highs are
       clearer.
       And now, it comes with the fabric design that customers tell us the
       love .

         ______________________________________________________________

       In addition to Charcoal, Sandstone and Heather Gray, we’re
       introducing another color for customers, Twilight Blue.

       We started frustration detection with music because it continues to
       be one of the most popular things with Alexa. We want to make sure
       our customers have a lot of choices when it comes to listening to
       music with Alexa.
       And just last week, we announced that HD music from Amazon Music is
       coming to Alexa—it’s much higher quality with tons of selection.
       Existing Amazon Music Unlimited customers can add this for only $5
       more a month.
     * 10:20 AM
       09/25/19
       With this experience, Alexa understands the tone and inflection of
       the customer - and can acknowledge the frustration like a person
       would. This will start to roll out in the U.S. beginning next year.
     * 10:19 AM
       09/25/19
       As customers continue to use Alexa more often, they want her to be
       more conversational and can get frustrated when Alexa gets
       something wrong. To help with this, we developed a deep learning
       model to detect when customers are frustrated, not with the world
       around them, but with Alexa. And when she recognizes you’re
       frustrated with her, Alexa can now try to adjust, just like you or
       I would do.
     * 10:18 AM
       09/25/19
       We’re announcing the first celebrity voice for Alexa, brought to
       life using Neural TTS.
       Iconic actor and producer Samuel L. Jackson is the first celebrity
       voice for Alexa. He can tell you jokes, let you know if it’s
       raining, set timers and alarms, play music and more – all with a
       bit of his own personality. Two versions of his voice are available
       - explicit and non-explicit.
       You’ll be able to interact with Samuel L. Jackson later this year -
       and if you add this personality in 2019, you'll get a special price
       of $0.99. Stay tuned for more celebrity voices next year.
       Samuel L. Jackson: Alexa’s newest celebrity voice

       While customers love Alexa's voice, they sometimes want to hear a
       completely different voice. Customers loved getting morning
       greetings from Chelsea Handler, and a duet with Ed Sheeran.
       In the past, we had to script and record all of these interactions,
       but with neural text to speech, we're able to model a celebrity
       voice directly.
     * 10:16 AM
       09/25/19
       We can also use this neural text to speech technology to make Alexa
       more emotive and expressive. She can sound more excited, like when
       your favorite team wins the game. Or, she can mimic other types of
       expressions. So, if she’s reading the news, she has a newscaster
       voice that sounds like the cadence of how you read the news.
     * 10:15 AM
       09/25/19
       Another benefit we've discovered moving to neural test to speech
       has been it gives us more freedom to invent for our customers. For
       example, the same TTS technology and back-end work on natural
       language processing also allows us to add new types of lanaguges
       very quickly.
       With billions of people in the world speaking more than one
       language, many homes are not homogenous when it comes to languages
       anymore.
       So for those customers, we’re rolling out Multilingual Mode. This
       will be available in three pairs to start: in the United States -
       English and Spanish, in India - Indian English and Hindi, and in
       Canada - Canadian English and French.
       U.S. Spanish and Multilingual Mode will be available starting next
       month and we will continue to build.
     * 10:14 AM
       09/25/19
       From the very beginning of Alexa, customers have enthralled with
       Alexa's personality.
       Whether it's jokes, her opinions or original songs, the core of her
       personality is her name and her voice.
       When we introduced Alexa, we used state-of-the art text to speech
       technology. Now, we're working to make Alexa's personalities - and
       customer interactions more natural.
     * 10:13 AM
       09/25/19
       Introducing Echo Dot with Clock
       New Amazon Echo with clock on a bedside table
         ______________________________________________________________

       It has all the things customers love about the Echo Dot, but the
       team added a vivid LED to give customers access to the clock
       whenever you want it. The Echo Dot with Clock can also display
       things like the temperature or alarm times.
       Best yet, if used as an alarm clock, you can simply tap to snooze
       your alarm for a few more minutes of sleep.
       It's available for pre-order starting today, for $59.99
     * 10:12 AM
       09/25/19
       The all-new Echo Dot we announced last year has been the
       fastest-selling Echo Dot ever - and it has a 4.6 star rating. But
       that doesn't mean we stop innovating on behalf of our customers.
       Customer engagements inspire us to invent things we'll talk about
       today. For example, customers have asked Alexa the time, billions
       of times.
     * 10:11 AM
       09/25/19
       Taking it a step further - starting today - we're adding an auto
       delete option for customers to our Privacy Hub. Customers can now
       opt in to have their voice recordings older than three months or 18
       months automatically deleted on an ongoing basis.
       Within those windows of time, customers can continue to use other
       privacy features.
       We'll continue to invent more privacy features on behalf of our
       customers.
     * 10:10 AM
       09/25/19
       We're adding utterances to give customers more transparency. You
       can now say, “Alexa, tell me what you heard,” and Alexa will read
       back your most recent voice request. This will be available today.
       Later this year, you'll be able to say, “Alexa, why did you do
       that?” and Alexa will provide a short explanation about her
       response to your last voice request.
     * 10:09 AM
       09/25/19
       Earlier this year, we launched our new Privacy Hub, a one-stop shop
       for customers to learn about and manage their privacy settings,
       including a one-button delete all option.
       Also, we were the first to offer customers the ability to opt-out
       from having their voice recordings be annotated by humans.
       Additionally, we gave customers the ability to say, “Alexa, delete
       everything I said today,” and “Alexa, delete what I just said” a
       few months ago, to make it easier for someone interacting with a
       device to delete their recordings.
     * 10:08 AM
       09/25/19
       We're investing in privacy across the board. Here are some
       examples...
       We introduced a camera shutter that electronically disconnects the
       camera on Echo Show 5 to give customers added peace of mind.
       We also want to give customers control in other camera products,
       like Ring. Earlier this year we rolled out Privacy Zones, which let
       you exclude selected areas of the camera’s field of view from being
       recorded or viewed live. We also added a toggle in the Ring app so
       it’s easy for customers to turn off audio recording.
       In November, we’ll roll out a new “Home" mode for Ring cameras, so
       your camera is never recording video or audio at all when you’re
       home.
     * 10:06 AM
       09/25/19
       When we developed Alexa, we developed on-device keyword spotting
       that lets Alexa detect a wake word, and only the wake word. When
       that happens, you see a blue indicator light to let you know that
       Alexa is streaming audio to the cloud. In the last year, our wake
       word engine has gotten 50% more accurate.
       We're continuing to offer our Wake Word Engine to device makers, so
       they can build Alexa into their products.
     * 10:06 AM
       09/25/19
       Privacy cannot be an afterthought when it comes to the Devices and
       Services we offer our customers. It has to be foundational and
       built in from the beginning for every piece of hardware, software,
       and service that we create.
     * 10:05 AM
       09/25/19
       Limp notes that customers share feedback, and our teams are focused
       on how we can continue to build and innovate on behalf of our
       customers.
     * 10:04 AM
       09/25/19
       Customers interact with Alexa billions of time a week. Echo devices
       have received more than 400,000 5-star reviews globally.
     * 10:04 AM
       09/25/19
       When we introduced Echo, Alexa only knew how to do 13 things. Now
       Alexa can tell jokes, read the news to you, give you reminders, and
       more.
     * 10:03 AM
       09/25/19
       Customer obsession is embedded in everything we do. We work
       backwards from the customer for everything we invent. He's sharing
       a an image of the working backwards document from our very first

       09/25/19
       And with that, the Amazon Devices & Services Event is coming to a
       close. As you can see, the team has been incredibly busy over the
       past year. We’re very excited to share these new products and get
       them to customers to see if they love them as much as we do.
     * 11:24 AM
       09/25/19
       Echo Frames and Echo Loop will be available in limited volumes by
       invite only. The invite price reflects our desire to get feedback
       from customers. Echo Frames will be available for a special price
       of $179.99 during the invite period. Echo Loop will be $129.99
       during the invite period. Both will begin shipping later this year.
     * 11:23 AM
       09/25/19
       The second Day 1 Edition product is called Echo Loop. It’s an
       Alexa-enabled smart ring packed with ways to stay on top of your
       day. It has 2 microphones activated by a button tap. With Echo
       Loop, you'll have more information at your finger tips - literally.

       grocery store.
         ______________________________________________________________

       Echo Loop has two-microphones, the smallest speaker ever on an Echo
       device, and a haptic engine that vibrates discreetly when you
       receive notifications or an incoming call, or to signal that the
       button has been pressed and Alexa is streaming your request to the
       cloud. It’s a ton of technology packed into this small form factor.
       Paired with your phone, this ring lets you access information
       throughout the day. It’s super easy to connect with Alexa without
       breaking stride or digging out your phone, for those simple things
       like turning on the lights or calculating the tip on your lunch
       bill. Simply press a button talk softly to Alexa and then the
       answer comes discretely through a small speaker built into the
       ring.
     * 11:21 AM
       09/25/19
       The first Day One Edition product is Echo Frames - Alexa-enabled
       glasses that let you get more done and be more present. They look
       like regular prescription glasses (without a prescription, but you
       can add one), and they’re comfortable, weighing only 31 grams.
       They don’t have a camera or display to get in the way—they’re all
       about all-day access to Alexa on-the-go while keeping your hands,
       ears, and eyes free to engage with the world around you.

       Customers do wonder how we launch new products.
       So today we’re launching Day 1 Editions, a new way for us to get
       new products out in limited volume, to customers, and to get real
       feedback—and if customers love them, we’ll double down and build a
       lot more.
     * 11:18 AM
       09/25/19
       Echo Buds are helpful in so many ways, including shopping. We
       worked with the Whole Foods team to make this experience really
       delightful in store. For example, you'll be able to ask Alexa if
       Whole Foods has canned tomatoes in stock as well as where you can
       find canned tomatoes.
       Echo Buds are available for pre-order starting today for $129.99
       and will start shipping in October.
     * 11:17 AM
       09/25/19
       When talking with customers, something came back consistently.
       Easy-to-use noise reduction was critical. We're excited to be
       working with Bose to incorporate Bose Active Noise Reduction
       technology into Echo Buds for customers.
       To help you navigate your everyday life, with a double tap, you can
       turn on and off the noise reduction for pass through mode if you
       want to clearly hear the world around you.
       You can also tap and hold to access your phone’s voice services
       like Siri or Google Assistant.
     * 11:16 AM
       09/25/19
       Meet Echo Buds, the first Echo wearable to offer customers
       hands-free access to Alexa, on-the-go. When we set out to build
       Echo Buds, we looked at what customers would want from earbuds.
       Excellent sound. To do that, each earbud has two premium, balanced
       armature drivers, inspired by those used by professional musicians.
       These deliver crisp, clear vocals, and dynamic bass.
       Echo Buds have 5 hours of battery life with just the earbuds and up
       to 20 hours of battery life with the case.

       But, customers tell us that they want Alexa to be with them
       everywhere - not only at home and in the car.
     * 11:15 AM
       09/25/19
       Today we’re excited to announce a General Motors Alexa integration.
       GM is the first automaker to deliver a fully embedded Alexa
       experience based on the Alexa Auto SDK, and the breadth: Alexa will
       be available on millions of vehicles across all four GM brands –
       Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. The best part is that this
       isn’t just about brand new vehicles. It’ll also be available to
       millions of existing vehicles on the road with a simple
       over-the-air update.
       Alexa integration in GM vehicles
         ______________________________________________________________

     * 11:13 AM
       09/25/19
       When we looked to bring Alexa beyond the home, the obvious place
       for us to start was in the car. We’ve spent the last few years
       making Alexa available in more and more vehicles, whether it’s
       through Echo Auto, or through integrations with auto makers like
       Audi, BMW, Ford, and Toyota.
     * 11:12 AM
       09/25/19
       We will be publishing this protocol and allowing the Sidewalk
       network to be used by things we and other developers make to do
       secure, over-the-air updates to ensure the software is up to date,
       one of the biggest problems we face with the Internet of Things.
       It is very early days but we are so excited to see what developers
       will invent using Sidewalk.
     * 11:12 AM
       09/25/19
       As the Sidewalk network grows, it will be useful for keeping track
       of things. And what better to track than the family dog?
       We’re going to build a reference design called Ring Fetch - a dog
       tracker that will use Sidewalk and ping you if your dog leaves a
       certain perimeter. This will be coming next year.
       New Ring devices
         ______________________________________________________________

     * 11:11 AM
       09/25/19
       As we got to building this idea of this network, we learned that,
       with just a few access points, very broad coverage becomes
       available.
       We went to Ring HQ to test a few devices, and asked the team how
       long it would take to get an Amazon Sidewalk network up and
       running. We sent 700 devices out to employees, friends, and family,
       and three weeks later, we had the LA Basin - the second largest
       city in the country - completely covered in three weeks. Because it
       has such good overlap and range, you get great coverage.
     * 11:10 AM
       09/25/19
       We came up with a concept we call Amazon Sidewalk.
       A low bandwidth, highly secure network, that uses the free 900 MHz
       spectrum to first and foremost extend the distance at which you can
       control simple, low-cost, edge IoT devices.
       We think developers will build all kinds of useful, low-cost
       products for this network. We started with the obvious use case of
       lighting with Ring's smart lighting, but think about all the things
       that are far from your home WiFi that might use Sidewalk—weather
       stations to tell you how much rain you’ve gotten, a water sensor in
       your garden with your tomatoes, a little sensor in your mailbox
       that lets you know when the mail has been delivered. The
       possibilities are endless.
     * 11:09 AM
       09/25/19
       One of the things we learned from the Alexa Connect Kit is that
       developers are always looking for new ways to invent for their
       customers, and that includes pushing the boundaries outside the
       home. But when we do that, real technology problems come into play.
       Bluetooth has limited range. WiFi only goes so far. And 5G cellular
       is incredibly important when you need reliable, long distance,
       guaranteed delivery of data, but it can be complex. That leaves a
       middle ground for devices that are looking for low-cost, low-power,
       low bandwidth connection where battery life needs to be measured in
       years, not days.
     * 11:08 AM
       09/25/19
       Meet the Amazon Smart Oven a combination microwave, convection
       oven, air fryer and food warmer that you can control with your
       voice using compatible Alexa-enabled devices. Just ask Alexa to
       cook common foods using dozens of presets that have been carefully
       tested and tuned. Alexa will announce when to stir the food during
       cooking and let you know when it’s finished.

         ______________________________________________________________

       You can also scan to cook hundreds of packaged foods from your
       Alexa app. The instructions automatically preload on your oven.
       Press start and you’re good to go.

       The Amazon Smart Oven will be available for $249.99, including an
       Echo Dot, on presale starting today.
     * 11:07 AM
       09/25/19
       We have extended the Alexa Connect Kit in two ways. First, we added
       new multi-step capabilities so that devices can feed telemetry to
       the cloud, make new decisions about operations, and give new
       instructions to devices—so any device can keep getting smarter just
       like Alexa. Second, we introduced a new host of cooking
       capabilities like temperature, preheat your oven, and scan to cook.
       There are a few devices already that will be using this which will
       be adopting these APIs. In addition, we wanted to build a reference
       design to inspire more developers.
     * 11:06 AM
       09/25/19
       This also means that there has never been more diversity in the
       number of products that have Alexa built in, or products that use
       the Alexa Connect Kit. Last year, we introduced the AmazonBasics
       Microwave as an example of what’s possible—we are amazed that even
       as a reference design, it’s become the best-selling microwave on
       Amazon.
     * 11:05 AM
       09/25/19
       None of these advancements in smart home would be possible without
       our community of developers. There are now more than 85,000
       Alexa-compatible smart home devices and more than 100,000 Alexa
       skills. There are now billions of dollars flowing through the Alexa
       economy—that’s developer only.
     * 11:04 AM
       09/25/19
       And we’re adding an all new product to the lineup - the Ring Indoor
       Cam, our lowest-cost home security camera.
       It’s compact design means you can mount it just about anywhere in
       the home. It, too, has everything you love about Ring cameras, plus
       it will have those great modes I mentioned earlier so you can
       control when it records and when it’s in “Home” mode.
       New Ring devices
         ______________________________________________________________

       Ring Indoor Cam will be available for just $59.99 and is available
       today.
     * 11:03 AM
       09/25/19
       From the beginning, customers have loved Ring’s integration of
       cameras. From their Video Doorbells to Spotlight Cams and
       Floodlight Cams.
       Meet the all-new Stick Up Cam, the most versatile of Ring’s

       Many homes have the home security box in their garage or basement,
       that's no longer in use. Tens of millions of American homes have a
       security system hub or countless other systems that are installed
       but out of use. And the last thing we want to do is sell more
       accessories that customers don’t need.
       So, we created the Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit—a DIY kit that customers
       can connect to an existing security system hub already in their
       home, so they can use the sensors previously installed in their
       home and integrate easily with Ring Alarm.
       The Alarm Hub and Retrofit Alarm Kit will be available together for
       $375.99, or just the Retrofit Alarm Kit for only $199.99. Ring
       Retrofit Alarm Kit will ship in November.

       Just over a year ago, we announced Ring Alarm, which is already the
       best-selling home security system on Amazon and at Best Buy this
       year. We know that when you make something simple, affordable, and
       do it yourself, time and time again, it works.

       Echo Flex will be a new way to interact with Alexa, and it will
       also be a great sensor for a Ring home security system.
       Ring’s mission has been, from the beginning, about making homes and
       neighborhoods safer. In the 18 months since Ring became part of the
       Amazon family, Ring continues to protect millions of customers with
       more than 4 billion interactions per month.
       And we continue to see that when you add security to neighborhoods,
       it reduces crime.

       We came up with Echo Flex, it can be placed throughout your home.
       It’s compact, cordless, and plugs right into your wall outlet.
       Echo Flex has a small speaker—similar to a cell phone—so it’s not
       optimized for music, but it is optimized for Alexa’s voice. Echo
       Flex also includes a USB charging port so you can charge your
       phone, even if you have limited outlets. But that port can also be
       used for some really fun, useful accessories.

         ______________________________________________________________

       We gave the early interface API to a developer, and our first two
       accessories will be a motion sensor, perfect for hallways, and a
       smart nightlight.
       We’ll be sharing the specs for these accessories, and hope other 3P
       developers will build for Flex as well.
       Echo Flex is available for pre-order at $24.99, and accessories
       will be $14.99 each.

       With features like Guard, more and more customers want Alexa to be
       available throughout their homes and they're finding the most
       creative ways to do that – they’re even 3D printing Echo mounts. We
       thought we might make it easier for them.
     * 10:58 AM
       09/25/19
       And we’re making Guard even more valuable by adding another type of
       smart alert for sounds of activity. We’ve been working on the
       science training the local model to understand what sounds are
       correlated with different activities, so when you put Alexa into
       Away mode – and only when she’s in Away mode – Alexa can notify you
       when she detected the likelihood of activity in your home.
     * 10:58 AM
       09/25/19
       First, we’re bringing Guard to Routines so when you say, “Alexa I’m
       off to work,” Alexa will switch into away mode, lock your door, and
       turn on your exterior lights, all with a simple routine.
     * 10:56 AM
       09/25/19
       We talked about making your home simpler and smarter—it’s also
       important we make the home safer.
       Over the past year, Alexa Guard has had tremendous momentum. Turn
       on Alexa Guard and she moves into a mode so you get smart alerts
       when specific sounds are detected, like broken glass like CO
       alarms. Today, we’re improving Alexa Guard in two ways.
     * 10:56 AM

       next year.
     * 10:55 AM
       09/25/19
       Another way we’re making your home smarter and more proactive is by
       expanding the ways Alexa can be more conversational. At re:MARS, we
       spoke about conversational AI and the team wanted to explore how
       can we bring this to Ring Video Doorbells.
       Even though you’re connected to your doorbell all the time through
       the Ring app, maybe you don’t have you phone or you’re on a stage
       talking about doorbells. The team has been working on a doorbell
       concierge feature.

We’re introducing two new types of Alexa Hunches
       Alexa will have Hunches about things that need replacing around
       your house. That might be batteries for your smart locks and
       security cameras, printer ink and even air purifiers, and even that
       always seems to run out at the worst time possible.
       Alexa will also have Hunches about Routines that you may want to
       set up based on your daily habits.
       For example, if you set your alarm for 6 AM every day and then
       normally follow that up by asking for the weather and the score of
       the Cubs game. If you do that a few times, Alexa will understand
       and suggest that you may want to create a routine. All you have to
       do is say, “yes,” and the routine will be created.

       Certified for Humans and eero WiFi are two ways we’re making your
       home simpler. We’re also working on ways to make it smarter. One
       way is to make your home more proactive. One example of that is
       Hunches.
       We launched Hunches last year so Alexa can let you know when
       something is out of place or left undone – you left your lights on,
       your back door is unlocked. We’re making a lot of progress on this
       and getting good feedback from customers.
     * 10:52 AM
       09/25/19
       We’re excited for more customers to experience the magic of eero’s
       super simple WiFi and we want to make this experience even simpler
       through Alexa. So we taught Alexa about managing WiFi access.
       Instead of unlocking your phone and using an app, or using a
       dedicated skill, you can now say:
       “Alexa, pause the WiFi for dinner,”
       “Alexa, turn on the guest WiFi,”
       “Alexa, pause the Playstation WiFi.”
       We didn’t want to limit this feature to eero, so Alexa customers
       can use their voice to manage Wi-Fi access on compatible ASUS, and
       TP-Link routers this fall, and devices from Arris and Linksys
       starting early next year.
     * 10:51 AM
       09/25/19
       The all-new eero builds on the same simplicity and reliability of
       the eero Pro and eero Beacon lineup.
       eero’s dual band radio and TrueMesh technology combine to give you
       whole-home WiFi coverage—no more dead zones in your home.
       For additional peace of mind, customers can choose optional
       subscribtions eero Secure or eero Secure+ to safeguard the devices
       that connect to their networks.
       The all-new eero is available today in the US for $99 or $249 for a
       3-pack. And eero will be available in Europe in early November.

       Another way to make your smart home simpler is with WiFi -- and
       talking about WiFi, no one is better at this than eero -- that’s
       why we are so excited that eero became part of the Amazon family
       earlier this year. They have a mission of building the best,
       simplest, and most secure WiFi solution in the world.

       We’re starting with select smart lights, plugs, and small
       appliances. What these devices have in common is we certified them
       based on over a dozen criteria.
       A few of the criteria include:
       - The product uses Frustration Free Setup
       - They have background, silent over the air updates so the software
       is always up to date
       - Customers can set them up with the Alexa app they already have
     * 10:48 AM
       09/25/19
       To validate these products are actually easy to set up, we convened
       a non-expert panel with no geeks allowed, no IT directors. They
       tried our first group of Certified for Humans products and they
       were delighted.
     * 10:47 AM
       09/25/19
       To continue building on our Frustration Free Setup vision, we’re
       announcing Certified for Humans, a new program that identifies
       devices that are struggle-free, tinker-free, and stress-free—no
       patience needed to get these installed.
     * 10:47 AM
       09/25/19
       Let’s start with simpler. Last year, we introduced Frustration Free
       Setup, and the AmazonBasics Smart Plug. It has a 4.5-star rating
       and we have sold millions of them. That’s all we need to know that
       Frustration Free Setup is on the right track for actual humans
       looking to create a smart home.

       Another delightful thing we've seen over the past year is how much
       kids relate to smart home. They love turning the lights on, and
       off, and on, and off… They do it because it's fun and delightful.
       We wanted to make that experience easier and even more fun for
       kids.
       Introducing Echo Glow, a multi-color smart lamp that pairs with
       Alexa that we think kids are going to love.

       Customers will be able to ask Alexa for a flickering campfire light
       for playtime, a Sleep Timer that gradually dims as bedtime nears,
       or, coming soon, a dance party with music and lights. They can also
       set Echo Glow to softly cascade through all the colors of the
       rainbow or light up with your favorite color.

       Outside of the kitchen, another place we've seen momentum and
       customer excitement in the last year with Echo is with kids and
       families. We have a great FreeTime experience on Echo Dot, and we
       announced new colors, including our Rainbow design earlier this
       year.

       So we're excited to bring a brand new FreeTime experience to Echo
       Show.
       Just like we’ve done with FreeTime on Echo and Echo Dot, we’ve
       built this experience from the ground up with fun, educational
       content that kids love, and parental controls that give you peace
       of mind. And, we don’t do this work alone. We work closely with the
       Family Online Safety Institute, and other leading industry groups
       to ensure the experience is great for both kids and parents.
       Now, the millions of families that have FreeTime will be able to
       watch kid-friendly videos, make video calls with parent-approved
       contacts, and add fun stickers to photos. And, we think kids will
       love the addition of music lyrics on the screen for sing-a-long
       parties.
       We're excited to see how customers take advantage of this new
       experience for their families.

       Earlier today, Discovery, Inc. and Food Network announced a new
       cooking product – Food Network Kitchen – and we're thrilled to
       announce Alexa is their exclusive voice service.
       Customers will be able to watch live and on-demand episodes of Food
       Network TV shows on Echo Show - and when they see a recipe they
       like, they can just ask Alexa to save that recipe. Additionally,
       subscribers will be able to watch live and on-demand cooking
       classes from Food Network's lineup of world-class chefs like Alton
       Brown or Giada.
       To make the experience even more delightful, we worked closely with
       the teams so that when you're viewing a recipe, Alexa knows the
       context and details, so you can ask questions about needed
       ingredients and more to make sure you have everything you need.

       to communicate with family and friends.
       One of the places Echo Show is most popular, a place that’s perfect
       for an ambient user interface, is the kitchen. She does so many
       things that are incredibly helpful there, including setting timers,
       reading the news, and of course the communications feature we just

       While customers love Alexa's voice, they sometimes want to hear a
       completely different voice. Customers loved getting morning
       greetings from Chelsea Handler, and a duet with Ed Sheeran.
       In the past, we had to script and record all of these interactions,
       but with neural text to speech, we're able to model a celebrity
       voice directly.
     * 10:16 AM
       09/25/19
       We can also use this neural text to speech technology to make Alexa
       more emotive and expressive. She can sound more excited, like when
       your favorite team wins the game. Or, she can mimic other types of
       expressions. So, if she’s reading the news, she has a newscaster
       voice that sounds like the cadence of how you read the news.
     * 10:15 AM
       09/25/19
       Another benefit we've discovered moving to neural test to speech
       has been it gives us more freedom to invent for our customers. For
       example, the same TTS technology and back-end work on natural
       language processing also allows us to add new types of lanaguges
       very quickly.
       With billions of people in the world speaking more than one
       language, many homes are not homogenous when it comes to languages
       anymore.
       So for those customers, we’re rolling out Multilingual Mode. This
       will be available in three pairs to start: in the United States -
       English and Spanish, in India - Indian English and Hindi, and in
       Canada - Canadian English and French.
       U.S. Spanish and Multilingual Mode will be available starting next
       month and we will continue to build.
     * 10:14 AM
       09/25/19
       From the very beginning of Alexa, customers have enthralled with
       Alexa's personality.
       Whether it's jokes, her opinions or original songs, the core of her
       personality is her name and her voice.
       When we introduced Alexa, we used state-of-the art text to speech
       technology. Now, we're working to make Alexa's personalities - and
       customer interactions more natural.

       Introducing Echo Dot with Clock
       New Amazon Echo with clock on a bedside table
         ______________________________________________________________

       It has all the things customers love about the Echo Dot, but the
       team added a vivid LED to give customers access to the clock
       whenever you want it. The Echo Dot with Clock can also display
       things like the temperature or alarm times.
       Best yet, if used as an alarm clock, you can simply tap to snooze
       your alarm for a few more minutes of sleep.
       It's available for pre-order starting today, for $59.99
     * 10:12 AM
       09/25/19
       The all-new Echo Dot we announced last year has been the
       fastest-selling Echo Dot ever - and it has a 4.6 star rating. But
       that doesn't mean we stop innovating on behalf of our customers.
       Customer engagements inspire us to invent things we'll talk about
       today. For example, customers have asked Alexa the time, billions
       of times.
     * 10:11 AM
       09/25/19
       Taking it a step further - starting today - we're adding an auto
       delete option for customers to our Privacy Hub. Customers can now
       opt in to have their voice recordings older than three months or 18
       months automatically deleted on an ongoing basis.
       Within those windows of time, customers can continue to use other
       privacy features.
       We'll continue to invent more privacy features on behalf of our
       customers.
     * 10:10 AM
       09/25/19
       We're adding utterances to give customers more transparency. You
       can now say, “Alexa, tell me what you heard,” and Alexa will read
       back your most recent voice request. This will be available today.
       Later this year, you'll be able to say, “Alexa, why did you do
       that?” and Alexa will provide a short explanation about her
       response to your last voice request.
     * 10:09 AM
       09/25/19
       Earlier this year, we launched our new Privacy Hub, a one-stop shop
       for customers to learn about and manage their privacy settings,
       including a one-button delete all option.
       Also, we were the first to offer customers the ability to opt-out
       from having their voice recordings be annotated by humans.
       Additionally, we gave customers the ability to say, “Alexa, delete
       everything I said today,” and “Alexa, delete what I just said” a
       few months ago, to make it easier for someone interacting with a
       device to delete their recordings.
     * 10:08 AM
       09/25/19
       We're investing in privacy across the board. Here are some
       examples...
       We introduced a camera shutter that electronically disconnects the
       camera on Echo Show 5 to give customers added peace of mind.
       We also want to give customers control in other camera products,
       like Ring. Earlier this year we rolled out Privacy Zones, which let
       you exclude selected areas of the camera’s field of view from being
       recorded or viewed live. We also added a toggle in the Ring app so
       it’s easy for customers to turn off audio recording.
       In November, we’ll roll out a new “Home" mode for Ring cameras, so
       your camera is never recording video or audio at all when you’re
       home.
     * 10:06 AM
       09/25/19
       When we developed Alexa, we developed on-device keyword spotting
       that lets Alexa detect a wake word, and only the wake word. When
       that happens, you see a blue indicator light to let you know that
       Alexa is streaming audio to the cloud. In the last year, our wake
       word engine has gotten 50% more accurate.
       We're continuing to offer our Wake Word Engine to device makers, so
       they can build Alexa into their products.
     * 10:06 AM
       09/25/19
       Privacy cannot be an afterthought when it comes to the Devices and
       Services we offer our customers. It has to be foundational and
       built in from the beginning for every piece of hardware, software,
       and service that we create.
     * 10:05 AM
       09/25/19
       Limp notes that customers share feedback, and our teams are focused
       on how we can continue to build and innovate on behalf of our
       customers.
     * 10:04 AM
       09/25/19
       Customers interact with Alexa billions of time a week. Echo devices
       have received more than 400,000 5-star reviews globally.
     * 10:04 AM
       09/25/19
       When we introduced Echo, Alexa only knew how to do 13 things. Now
       Alexa can tell jokes, read the news to you, give you reminders, and
       more.
     * 10:03 AM
       09/25/19
       Customer obsession is embedded in everything we do. We work
       backwards from the customer for everything we invent. He's sharing
       a an image of the working backwards document from our very first
       Echo device - codename was Doppler.
