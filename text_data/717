Abstract

   Declining deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon are touted as a
   conservation success, but illegal logging is a problem of similar
   scale. Recent regulatory efforts have improved detection of some forms
   of illegal logging but are vulnerable to more subtle methods that mask
   the origin of illegal timber. We analyzed discrepancies between
   estimated timber volumes of the national forest inventory of Brazil and
   volumes of logging permits as an indicator of potential fraud in the
   timber industry in the eastern Amazon. We found a strong overestimation
   bias of high-value timber species volumes in logging permits. Field
   assessments confirmed fraud for the most valuable species and
   complementary strategies to generate a “surplus” of licensed timber
   that can be used to legalize the timber coming from illegal logging. We
   advocate for changes to the logging control system to prevent
   overexploitation of Amazonian timber species and the widespread forest
   degradation associated with illegal logging.

INTRODUCTION

   Tropical forests have been one of the main foci of the international
   environmental movement because of their importance in regulating
   climate and protecting biodiversity and because of the high rates of
   deforestation and degradation observed in recent decades (1, 2). The
   Brazilian Amazon—the largest tropical forest worldwide—has become a
   global model for developing solutions to safeguard tropical forests (3)
   through creation of large protected areas (4), enforcement of
   environmental legislation (5), interventions in the soy and cattle
   supply chains (6), use of advanced technologies to monitoring
   deforestation by PRODES (Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project) (7),
   and establishment of large logging concessions on public lands
   threatened by forest encroachment (8). Together, these strategies have
   worked to reduce deforestation rates by 76% from 2004 to 2017 (9).
   Illegal logging affects as much area as deforestation in the Brazilian
   Amazon (10, 11) and is another major threat to biodiversity
   conservation in the region, as well as a catalyst for further
   degradation (12, 13). The effectiveness of policy interventions to
   prevent illegal logging in the Amazon, however, is less known and
   difficult to measure. Remote sensing technologies have been developed
   to identify areas of illegal logging (14) and some obvious
   irregularities in authorized management plans (15), but no alternative
   is available for large-scale assessments of more subtle noncompliance
   with logging permits, such as deliberate overestimation of high-value
   timber species inventories.

   Illegal logging is a huge barrier for using timber markets to promote
   sustainable use and conservation of forests. Forty-four percent (46,149
   ha) of all tropical timber harvested between 2015 and 2016 in Pará—the
   largest timber production state in the Brazilian Amazon—was illegal
   (15). In an attempt to minimize illegal logging, the Brazilian
   government established a public forest concession system in 2006, which
   created opportunities for private entrepreneurs and communities to
   harvest timber on 23,844 km^2 of public forest land (16). On private
   landholdings, timber harvesting is regulated by specific legislation
   and by IBAMA (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos
   Naturais Renováveis), the federal environmental agency. For mechanized
   logging, permits have to respect a maximum of 30 m^3 ha^−1 timber yield
   in harvesting cycles of 25 to 35 years and a minimum felling diameter
   at breast height (DBH) of 50 cm (except when a specific DBH is assigned
   for a given species) and to retain commercial-size seed trees (at least
   10% of large trees with commercial DBH in the area or three trees per
   100 ha, whichever rule is more restrictive) (17). Legal timber
   harvesting, transportation, processing, and trading are tracked through
   the Document of Forest Origin (that is, paperwork formally required in
   each of these steps), which should, in theory, prevent fraud.
   Operationalizing this control system, however, has been problematic.
   The Pará state environmental agency has 55 forest officers to analyze,
   audit, and approve forest management applications in the
   1.24-million-km^2 state (almost the size of Peru). The mismatch between
   the current staffing and the area of forest being logged prevents field
   checking of logging permits—an invitation for fraud and corruption.
   Remote monitoring and case studies suggest that various forms of fraud
   contribute to the continued prevalence of illegal logging (15, 18). We
   investigated the potential role of one such form of fraud (that is,
   deliberate overestimation of high-value timber populations) in
   facilitating extraction and sale of illegal timber.

   We evaluated evidence of fraud in the timber industry in the Brazilian
   Amazon based on the discrepancy between the estimated timber volumes in
   plots established by the government in undisturbed forests and the
   volumes of approved logging permits, as well as field assessments of
   six logged areas. We focused our analysis on Pará, eastern Amazon—the
   main timber production and export state. First, we integrated data of
   427 valid logging permits issued from 2012 to 2017 in Pará, with 426
   1-ha plots surveyed through the national forest inventory of Brazil
   (hereafter referred to as RADAM plots) (19) distributed across Pará
   state (fig. S1). From a total of 80 potential species, we selected 11
   species or species groups (2 or 3 species sold with the same commercial
   name) with at least 50 observations in both logging permits and RADAM
   plots for comparison. These species represented a range of wood values
   and accounted for a total of 2.8 million m^3 of timber, 482,682 trees,
   and more than US$52 million of licensed timber (table S1). Discrepancy
   analyses were complemented by post-logging field assessments of six
   logging permits in western Pará accounting for a forest management area
   of 671,954 ha, in which the timber volume of ipê species (Handroanthus
   spp.) intended to be harvested in forest management area was much
   higher (>4 m^3 ha^−1) than those observed in RADAM plots (0.7 m^3
   ha^−1).

RESULTS

   The discrepancy between timber volumes registered in forest management
   units of approved logging permits and those observed in RADAM plots was
   positively correlated with timber price of standing trees, indicating a
   strong bias of potential overestimation of the most valuable timber
   species in logging permits (Fig. 1A). This pattern persisted when a
   more conservative analytical approach was used to compare timber
   volumes of low-, medium-, and high-value species of logging permits to
   quantile classes near the density distribution limit of those species’
   timber volumes in RADAM plots; we found that high-value species volumes
   exceeded the 90th percentile Amazon-wide inventory values in a larger
   proportion of logging permits than did volumes for less desirable
   timber species (Fig. 1B). Overall, the logging permits with potential
   overestimated timber volumes were spatially independent, which
   conflicts with the interpretation that higher timber volumes in logging
   permits are associated with specific regions where commercial timber
   species are more abundant (Fig. 2).

   The discrepancy between timber volumes registered to be harvested in
   forest management units of approved logging permits and those observed
   in RADAM plots (that is, plots surveyed through the national forest
   inventory of Brazil) was positively correlated with timber price of
   standing trees (A), as was the proportion of logging permits with
   timber volumes located in the quantile classes of >90% (all colors
   except blue) of the density distribution of timber volumes of RADAM
   plots (B). Vertical error bars in (A) represent the SD.

   Fig. 2 Spatial distribution of logging permits according to their level
   of discrepancy in relation to RADAM plots.

   Distribution in the state of Pará of logging permits with timber
   volumes located in the quantile classes of >90% (all colors except
   blue) of the density distribution of timber volumes of RADAM plots
   (that is, plots surveyed through the national forest inventory of
   Brazil) of different Amazonian timber species. The top part of the
   figure shows the distribution of Handroanthus spp. Maps for other
   species are ordered from low- to high-value species from top left to
   bottom right in the layout.

   A minority of professionals were in charge of logging permits with
   higher probability of fraud (for example, with timber volume ratio in
   logging permits versus RADAM plots > 2), except for the most valuable
   species (Handroanthus spp.), for which most foresters registered much
   higher timber volumes in forest management units than those reported by
   RADAM plots (Fig. 3A). Four of the five species with the highest wood
   prices concentrated the most discrepant values (Fig. 3A), and the
   amount of variation among foresters increased with timber price (Fig.
   3B). These results indicate that the general pattern of overestimated
   timber volumes in logging permits is strongly influenced by timber
   price and that a relatively small subset of professional foresters is
   associated with the most egregious overestimations.

   Fig. 3 Distribution of potentially fraudulent logging permits and
   overestimation variation among foresters.

   Distribution of the average ratio of timber volume in logging permits
   to RADAM plots (that is, plots surveyed through the national forest
   inventory of Brazil) of each forester in charge of logging permit,
   ordered from lowest to highest ratio for each species group on the x
   axis (A), and positive correlation between the SD of the ratios
   associated with different foresters and timber price of standing trees
   (B).

   Only 61% of the 152 trees identified as ipê species (Handroanthus spp.)
   in logging permits were confirmed during field checking of logged
   forests. The average proportion of botanical identification “mistakes”
   across the six areas was 42%, varying from no error in one site to
   93.3% error in another. We found 13 commercial species “erroneously”
   identified as ipê, with low-value tanimbuca (Terminalia sp.), jarana
   (Lecythis lurida), and timborana (Anadenanthera sp.) being the most
   frequent (72.4% of the individuals); 85 ± 10% of the non-ipê trees were
   of species not included in the logging permit of the forest (that is,
   not considered valuable enough to harvest), which means that their
   harvesting was not anticipated or controlled and that the extra ipê
   volume garnered through “misidentification” could be easily used to
   mask illegal ipês. Ipê species are quite easy to identify and clearly
   distinguish morphologically (compound, palmate leaves) from the three
   species most frequently identified as ipê (simple leaves in jarana and
   tanimbuca and twice pinnate leaves in timborana), so misidentification
   can be attributed to fraud. In addition, we found that the diameter of
   real ipê trees was frequently overestimated. Overall, the stump
   diameters of 130 logged trees assessed in field checking were 31%
   smaller than the DBH claimed in logging permits, despite the fact that
   diameter measurements at stump height will almost always overestimate
   DBH. Naming other species as ipê and inflating tree diameter can be
   complementary strategies to generate a “surplus” of licensed ipê timber
   in logging permits to legalize the timber coming from illegal logging.
   Inventing trees, duplicating tree numbers, exceeding allowed harvest
   rates, and felling trees in forbidden zones (for example, reserve
   areas) were also observed, although less frequent. In all of the
   management areas investigated, we found evidence that the ipê timber
   volume reported on the Document of Forest Origin could not have been
   produced from that area alone while following harvest regulations.

DISCUSSION

   The discrepancies between timber volumes from logging permits and RADAM
   plots may be associated with deliberate inflation of values to obtain
   the Document of Forest Origin to legalize timber extracted above
   authorized volumes, without maintaining the legal minimum number of
   seed trees, and in areas where timber exploitation is not permitted.
   Ipê was by far the species with the strongest signal of potential fraud
   in logging permits. It is the internationally preferred timber for
   decking and one of the most expensive species in the market (20), with
   prices as high as those achieved historically by big-leaf mahogany
   (Swietenia macrophylla King) before commercial exploitation was
   prohibited in Brazil in 2001 to avoid the species’ extinction. We found
   evidence that ipê is the “new big-leaf mahogany” and that overlogging
   may lead this species to extinction (21). This species is one of the
   most vulnerable to logging in Amazonian forests because of its natural
   low density and low growth rates (21). A total of 33,389 m^3 was
   licensed to be logged in 2017, and 74.2% of this volume has a high risk
   of being overestimated (that is, located in logging permits included in
   the quantile >95% of the density distribution of timber volumes; Fig.
   2). This suggests that the issues observed in our field assessments are
   likely to be widespread.

   Given the high probability of fraud in logging permits, we advocate
   supply chain interventions, following the examples of the soy and beef
   moratoriums implemented in the same region a few years ago (6). The
   timber moratorium would create the chance for the Brazilian
   Environmental Agency to revisit logging permits and check
   inconsistencies in the field, using the analytical framework presented
   here or another approach developed for this task. Field checking of
   logging plans is an essential component for preventing fraud. For
   instance, post-logging field inspections of forest concessions in the
   Peruvian Amazon resulted in the cancellation of almost half of
   inspected concessions due to major violations of existing norms (22).
   We are aware that a moratorium could cause economic setbacks to the
   Brazilian timber industry, which accounted for 85% of all neotropical
   production of roundlogs (13) and a total export value of US$600 million
   in 2016 (23). However, Brazilian law does not allow timber trading that
   comes at the expense of overexploitation and potential extinction of
   native trees. It is already known that current logging regulations
   applied to forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon are not expected
   to safeguard the long-term conservation of timber species, given that
   most targeted species are rare and slow-growing (13). However, the
   apparent substantial overestimation of timber volumes in logging
   licenses could represent the “kiss of death” for species like ipê.

   Frauds during timber harvesting licensing can occur as a result of
   negligence and corruption in several ways: (i) through the approval of
   logging activities in areas already exploited or deforested, (ii)
   issuing credits (that is, license to harvest timber) regardless of the
   authorized amount requested (even when impossibly large), (iii)
   registering fake tree inventories in the system to issue credits for
   timber companies that do not exist or do not have a forest to harvest
   legally, (iv) by obtaining credit for areas where there is no intention
   to log, and (v) overestimating the volume or density of valuable
   species (24). The illegal credits can be used to harvest, transport,
   and sell timber from unauthorized or prohibited logging areas. For
   example, around 90% of the illegally harvested area between 2008 and
   2012 in Pará state was conducted in indigenous lands and protected
   areas (25). Fraudulent logging operations are generally detected in
   isolated operations of regulatory agencies, covering a small fraction
   of the forest area logged annually, and always after timber
   exploitation. The large-scale detection of frauds before timber
   harvesting and identification of foresters involved in these frauds, as
   allowed by the methodological approach used in this work and the
   web-based system proposed here, would be a strategic advance for
   imposing critical barriers to continuation of illegal logging in the
   Brazilian Amazon (Fig. 4).

   The economic viability of sustainable timber management in the Amazon
   may rely on improving the public systems governing logging in native
   forests. The major competitor of legal logging is illegal logging,
   which pushes market timber prices down and undermines the necessary
   investments for reduced impact logging and enforcement of no-go zones.
   Although the timber moratorium could bring some relief to overexploited
   timber species, it will not solve the problem of the weak system used
   to control timber exploitation in the Amazon. Timber buyers should not
   rely solely on governments to reduce illegal logging. The timber market
   and other sectors of society should exert more pressure on governments
   to make the licensing processes fully transparent. The same is true for
   the existing chain of custody monitoring systems [for example, SINAFLOR
   (National System for the Control of the Origin of Forest Products) and
   SISFLORA (System for Marketing and Transporting of Forest Products) in
   Brazil] that are under the responsibility of state and federal
   environmental agencies. The Brazilian Federal Council of Engineering
   and Agronomy, which controls the activity of foresters, has the mandate
   to punish professionals involved in fraud and should make use of it.
   Certification schemes and emerging platforms to control timber origin
   (26) can also be part of the solution. On the other hand, a new control
   system is required and would be relatively easy to implement. The main
   problems currently observed in the present system—lack of consistency
   and standardization in species names, near-automatic approval of
   logging without previous field checking, and lack of integration among
   available databases on timber stocks and species distributions—could be
   partially resolved by creating a new web-based system to manage
   information (Fig. 4) and targeted field supervision of logging permits.

   Fig. 4 Proposed web-based system to register and manage logging
   permits.

   This system would require the documentation of species based on
   predefined, standardized botanical or commercial names, their
   associated timber volumes, and geospatial information on their
   localization in licensed forests, which would be integrated in the
   system with existing databases to assess the levels of discrepancies of
   informed and expected timber volumes in forest management units of
   logging permits. Field checking of logging permits would be guided by
   this analysis to optimize the use of a limited staff to control large
   areas of forest concessions.

   Scientific methods for timber identification and timber tracking have
   been developed to verify timber legality. These methods have mostly
   used visual identification (wood anatomy and dendrochronology),
   chemical approaches (mass spectrometry, near-infrared spectroscopy,
   stable isotopes, and radiocarbon dating), and genetic approaches (DNA
   barcoding, population genetics/phylogeography, and DNA fingerprint)
   (27). DNA technologies have been tested in several countries to combat
   illegal logging (28). In Indonesia, the integration of mandatory forest
   certification with the national system of legality of wood [SVLK
   (Sistem Verifikasi Legalitas Kayu)] has increased international
   credibility on the timber exploitation control system, since an
   independent auditor evaluates whether harvests are in accordance with
   the laws of the country (29). Other countries have their own systems
   for monitoring tropical timber chain of custody, and most of the
   successful cases involve field checking and stump inspection. The
   timber transportation control is usually made using travel permits.
   Thailand has checkpoints all over the country, some of which are open
   24 hours a day. Suriname has developed a computerized log-tracking
   system called LogPro to monitor all information about harvest
   operations, payment of forest fees, and forest planning (30). Producers
   are required by law to provide detailed information concerning the
   production, which is registered twice in the system by two independent
   data processors. The system crosses information and checks
   incompatibilities, thus reducing the possibility of corruption.

   Conserving Amazonian timber species requires a new model that includes
   enforcement and modernization of logging licenses, as well as
   meaningful engagement of all stakeholder groups. Conversion of
   paperwork to digital platforms would not only reduce the numerous
   problems caused by bureaucracy and the opportunities for corruption, it
   could also increase transparency and allow a better integration of
   existing databases to guide decision-making. In this context,
   scientists could partner with governments to develop effective
   solutions to environmental problems and reduce the gap between
   knowledge generation and application. Without a serious effort to
   address this issue, large-scale high-grading and degradation of
   Amazonian forests will continue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Logging permits and official forest inventories

   We gathered a total of 427 valid logging permits [AUTEF (Autorização de
   Exploração Florestal)] issued from 2012 to 2017 and available at the
   Integrated System for Monitoring and Environmental License [SIMLAM
   (Sistema Integrado de Monitoramento e Licenciamento Ambiental)] of the
   Environmental Secretariat of Pará. Logging permits classified as
   “canceled” or “suspended” were not considered. Each logging permit
   consisted of the list of species and respective timber volumes to be
   logged in the area licensed for timber exploitation (mean area of
   logging permits, 561 ha; range, 18 to 4552 ha) (fig. S1). The
   information presented in logging permits was obtained by the
   application of the legal norms on timber exploitation in native
   Amazonian forests (17) to a census of the area licensed for timber
   exploitation. We contrasted the timber volumes registered for harvest
   in forest management units of logging permits with those obtained by
   426 spatially independent, 1-ha RADAM plots (DBH, ≥50 cm; fig. S1).
   These RADAM plots were not randomly distributed in Pará state because
   of the inaccessibility of the vast majority of areas of the dense
   Amazon forest. However, the RADAM protocols attempted to collect
   representative samples of the major vegetation types in each region and
   avoided sampling disturbed forests by largely sampling in areas
   accessible only by helicopter, as far as possible from roads and trails
   (19). Although larger inventory plots would be preferred to compare
   with logging areas, the RADAM inventory is still the best source of
   information available for wide-scale assessments of timber stocks,
   aboveground biomass, and tree species distribution in the Brazilian
   Amazon and has been used in many studies (13, 21, 31, 32).

Timber species

   The taxonomic identification of timber species in the Amazon is
   problematic, and a mix of different scientific and common names is used
   for a single group of commercial timber species. A total of 80 timber
   “species” were found in logging permits, from which we selected 11
   species or species groups (two or three species sold with the same
   commercial name) for which we had at least 50 observations in both
   logging permits and RADAM plots (table S1). Timber prices of standing
   trees were obtained from (33), and monetary conversion was considered
   US$1 = R$3.15.

Field assessments

   To validate the analytical approach used to identify potential
   overestimated timber volumes in logging permits, we performed field
   assessments of ipê (Handroanthus spp.)—the commercial species with the
   highest timber price and for which we found the highest likelihood of
   fraud—in logged forests. We first selected recent logging permits
   (issued from August 2016 onward) in western Pará, totaling ~100 logging
   permits. Then, we selected the 19 logging permits that presented >4 m^3
   ipê timber per hectare, which also showed high discrepancy between
   estimated timber volumes of RADAM plots and the volumes of approved
   logging permits, and with volumes in the quantile classes of >95% of
   the density distribution of timber volumes. Finally, we selected six
   areas in accordance with the staff of IBAMA of the Ministry of
   Environment, which gave preference to small (~100 ha) areas planned to
   be harvested within just 1 or 2 years. These six areas represent small
   logging areas with a single annual production unit [Unidade de Produção
   Anual (UPA)], which comprise the majority of logging permits issued in
   Pará state. By the time field assessments are carried out, these areas
   had already been logged. Using the available documentation (forest
   surveys and maps) for each area, we randomly sampled the ipê trees
   listed in each area, which included both harvested and remnant trees.
   Standing trees were identified by observing vegetative materials, and
   the stumps were identified by observing external and internal bark
   traits and botanical attributes of shoots; when necessary, a piece of
   heartwood was collected with a chainsaw to examine its macroscopic
   anatomy. We measured the DBH of standing trees, and for logged trees,
   we calculated the mean diameter of each stump based on two
   perpendicular diameter measurements. Measurements of stump diameters
   were obtained at a height of ~45 cm, where the diameter is expected to
   be larger than that of the DBH. Therefore, our analysis was
   conservative, and higher diameter discrepancies would be expected if we
   had been able to measure actual DBH before harvest.

Statistical analysis

   We calculated the average ratio between the timber volume of each
   species in logging permits and the mean timber volume of the same
   species in all plots of RADAM inventory as a strategy to identify
   discrepancies between them and use it as a proxy to detect potential
   fraud (that is, inflated timber volumes in logging permits). We are
   aware that some discrepancies are to be expected when comparing timber
   volumes estimated from small official plots distributed over a wide
   geographical area with those from inventories of large logging areas.
   However, we did not focus the interpretation of results on the absolute
   values of these discrepancies but rather on the “direction” and
   consistency (if timber volumes were generally underrepresented or
   overrepresented) and on the bias toward overestimating the most
   valuable species. Given that the timber volume estimates of logging
   permits are expected to omit some commercial-size trees of each species
   to satisfy the legal criteria of keeping at least 10% of large trees in
   the area or three trees per 100 ha (or 15% of large trees and four
   trees per 100 ha for species included in the official lists of
   threatened species for which timber harvesting is allowed) and that the
   RADAM inventory did not use any exclusion criteria, our analysis can be
   considered conservative with respect to overestimation detection. We
   then performed a Pearson correlation between the average ratio of
   logging permits to RADAM plots and timber prices. We also investigated
   the discrepancies between timber volumes of logging permits and RADAM
   plots using a different analytical approach based on the density
   distribution of simulated larger RADAM plots and logging permits. Since
   the official inventory of RADAM was based on smaller inventory plots (1
   ha) than those used by the forest inventories associated with logging
   permits (18 to 4552 ha), we performed 10,000 randomizations of 19 1-ha
   plots (an area similar to the smallest logging permit inventory and one
   that makes a better histogram of timber volumes per species). We then
   generated histograms of official inventory/logging permit density
   distribution; assessed the proportion of logging permits with timber
   volumes included in the quantiles 90%, 90 to 95%, 95 to 99%, and >99%
   of the histogram of simulated RADAM plots with a larger (19 ha) area;
   and plotted the results in the map of Pará state to visualize their
   spatial distribution (see the example of Handroanthus spp. in Fig. 2).

   Furthermore, we obtained the identification of the forester in charge
   of each logging permit (97 professionals) and selected those with at
   least three licenses for one of the selected species. According to
   Brazilian regulations, forest management plans must have a forester in
   charge of the technical responsibility of operations. Then, we ranked
   the logging permits/RADAM plots ratio with the number of foresters as a
   means to evaluate the proportion of foresters in charge of logging
   permits with higher chances of fraud.

Abstract

   The development of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) is considered the
   biggest change to the global energy production system in the last
   half-century. However, several communities have banned fracking because
   of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human
   health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we
   analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from
   2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different
   distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and
   after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed
   maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were
   and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for
   negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3
   km of a mother’s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in
   utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts
   include a greater incidence of low–birth weight babies as well as
   significant declines in average birth weight and in several other
   measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects
   at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking
   are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the
   nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active
   fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of
   poor birth outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

   The growth in unconventional gas production involving hydraulic
   fracturing (“fracking”) has transformed the energy landscape, reducing
   energy prices, decreasing conventional air pollution by displacing coal
   in electricity generation, disrupting international energy trading
   arrangements, and increasing the prospects for energy self-sufficiency
   for the United States. At the same time, continuing concerns about the
   possible local health effects of hydraulic fracturing have led some
   states and communities to ban the practice altogether. The absence of a
   systematic evaluation of fracking’s health effects has complicated the
   decision process for those governments around the world who are
   debating whether to allow hydraulic fracturing.

   Hydraulic fracturing could affect human health through several
   channels, including water and air pollution. In the fracking process,
   water and other chemicals are forced into shale rock to fracture it and
   allow the gas or petroleum trapped in the shale to be tapped. Whereas
   much of the previous research has focused on water pollution (1–3),
   several recent studies address the possible effects of chemicals that
   have been found in both “fracturing fluid” (the fluid that is forced
   into the shale in order to fracture it) and in air emissions near
   fractured gas wells (4–6). One study measured various air pollutants
   weekly for a year surrounding the development of a newly fractured gas
   well and detected nonmethane hydrocarbons, methylene chloride (a toxic
   solvent), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been shown
   to affect fetal outcomes (7).

   There are at least two reasons to focus particularly on infant health
   in probing the health effects of exposure to hydraulic fracturing.
   First, there is increasing evidence that the fetus is vulnerable to a
   range of maternal pollution exposures (8–13). Second, because the fetus
   is in utero for at most 9 months, it is possible to pinpoint the timing
   of potential exposure. This is not the case with other possible health
   effects, such as cancer, that develop over long periods of time.
   Moreover, birth data are available with precise information on mothers’
   residential locations, permitting researchers to examine the effects of
   proximity to fracturing sites on the health of newborns.

   This paper provides evidence for impacts of hydraulic fracturing on
   human health, based on a large-scale analysis of vital statistics
   records from more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania during the
   period 2004–2013. Our empirical approach compares infants born to
   mothers living at different distances from hydraulically fractured well
   sites, both before and after hydraulic fracturing was initiated at the
   well site. In addition, we probe the robustness of the results by
   adjusting the estimates for maternal fixed effects to include
   comparisons of siblings who were exposed to fracking with those who
   were not. Further, we explore the relationship between infant health
   outcomes and residential distance from fracturing sites, comparing
   birth data from mothers residing at increasing 1-km intervals from the
   fracturing sites to investigate whether there is a gradient in the
   effects of exposure.

   The results of our analysis suggest that the introduction of fracking
   reduces health among infants born to mothers living within 3 km of a
   well site during pregnancy. For mothers living within 1 km, we find a
   25% increase in the probability of low birth weight (birth weight <
   2500 g) and significant declines in average birth weight and in an
   index of infant health. There are also reductions in infant health for
   mothers living within 1 to 3 km of a fracking site, but the estimates
   are about one-third to one-half of the size of those within the 0- to
   1-km band. There is little evidence of health effects at further
   distances, suggesting that health impacts are highly local.

   This paper addresses four problems that have plagued the previous
   literature (14–16). First, the sample size of this analysis is much
   larger than that used in previously published work. Second, in addition
   to examining low–birth weight status, which is the most commonly used
   measure of infant health in the literature, we use an index of infant
   health outcomes informed by the literature on multiple hypothesis
   testing (17, 18) to incorporate the many other measures of infant
   health that are available in the vital statistics data. Third, we test
   for effects at various distances of maternal residence from fracking
   sites, rather than imposing one arbitrary assumption about the distance
   where health impacts may become apparent, or about the functional form
   of the distance gradient.

   An additional innovation is that our models control for mother fixed
   effects. Estimates of fracking-independent aspects of maternal health
   in these models are controlled by comparing the health of
   fracking-exposed and unexposed siblings born to the same mother. In
   principle, this comparative technique controls for all the unobserved
   time invariant characteristics of the mother such as race that could
   confound conventional difference-in-differences estimates (that is,
   before and after comparisons of places with and without fracking).
   However, in practice, the mother fixed effects estimates are imprecise
   because there are relatively few sibling pairs with an exposed and an
   unexposed sibling even when we are examining all Pennsylvania births.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

   Figure 1 shows both the geographical distribution of births in
   Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the locations of fractured wells
   across the state. The greatest number of births occurs in the southeast
   of the state near Philadelphia, whereas fractured wells follow the
   state’s shale deposits along a diagonal path from the northeast to the
   southwest of the state. Although many areas with fracturing are lightly
   populated, the areas surrounding Pittsburgh have a high population
   density in addition to many fractured wells. Figure 2 illustrates the
   temporal distribution of fractured wells, showing that most new wells
   came online after 2009. Although the number of new wells peaked at the
   beginning of 2012, the amount and economic value of gas production
   continued to grow over our sample period.

   Fig. 1 Locations of births and fractured wells in Pennsylvania.

   Each square displayed above is 0.25° latitude by 0.25° longitude. We
   use all birth certificates in Pennsylvania for 2004–2013. They include
   maternal address which is used to calculate average yearly births per
   square. Black triangles represent the exact locations of fractured
   wells, which we observe from the Pennsylvania Department of
   Environmental Protection (DEP) Internal Operator Well Inventory. These
   data include all oil and gas wells with a Pennsylvania DEP drilling
   permit and which are not currently filled in (plugged). We queried this
   database in November 2014. Fractured wells are those marked
   “unconventional” in the database. We have dropped any wells with
   missing American Petroleum Institute numbers, spud or permit date, or
   location information.

   Fig. 2 Number of fractured wells and value of all drilling in
   Pennsylvania (2004–2013).

   The left y axis shows total fractured wells in Pennsylvania by spud
   year and quarter (that is, the commencement of drilling), and the right
   y axis reports annual values of gas from fractured wells in
   Pennsylvania. X axis shows spud year and month (dates of commencement
   of drilling) that are recorded in the Pennsylvania DEP Internal
   Operator Well Inventory, which is described in the notes to Fig. 1.
   Annual gas production per well is recorded by the Pennsylvania DEP in
   its Oil and Gas Historical Production Report. We merge these data to
   our Internal Operator Well Inventory data by well identification number
   and then sum gas production to the year level. To convert production to
   dollars, we use gas prices from the U.S. Energy Information
   Administration (EIA), which reports the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot
   Price (www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdA.htm). To convert to British
   Thermal Units annual heating values for Pennsylvania are taken from the
   EIA.

   Table 1 explores differences in maternal characteristics, infant
   characteristics, and health outcomes between mothers who were
   potentially exposed to fracturing and those who were not. The first two
   columns show variable means for mothers whose residences were less than
   1 km from a location (or multiple locations) that fractured. Columns
   (3) and (4) report the means for births to mothers who live within 3 to
   15 km of a well location. These samples are further divided into those
   whose infants were born before the spud date (that is, the commencement
   of drilling)—thus, never exposed to fracking—and those whose babies
   were born after the spud date. When the mother is within 1 km of
   multiple locations, we use the earliest spud date to align with the
   approach used in the regression analysis.
   Table 1. Difference in means.

   The data source is the universe of birth certificates in Pennsylvania
   (2004–2013) matched to the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well
   Inventory. Maternal and infant demographic indicators and health
   outcomes are recorded at the time of birth. “Near, 0–1 km” indicates
   that the mother lives within 0 to 1 km of at least one well site. “Far,
   3–15 km” indicates that the mother lives 3 to 15 km from the nearest
   well site. Columns (5) to (7) report P values from t tests of equality
   of means across the different samples indicated. Column (7) tests
   whether (2) − (1) = (4) − (3). This quantity is referred to as the
   difference-in-differences, or D-in-D.

   The remaining columns, (5) to (7), report P values from tests that the
   means are equal across the pairs of columns indicated in the row
   headings. These tests help shed light on the credibility of different
   approaches to measuring the infant health effects of fracking exposure.
   Column (5) reports P values for t tests of the hypothesis that the
   means are equal within 0 to 1 km of a well location before and after
   the spud date. These comparisons indicate that mothers whose babies
   were potentially exposed to nearby fracturing in utero are younger,
   less likely to have been married at the time of the birth, and less
   educated—characteristics that might lead to worse infant health
   outcomes even in the absence of fracturing. Column (6) reveals that
   there are also significant changes in the characteristics of infants
   and mothers who live 3 to 15 km from a fractured well site after the
   spud date, relative to before. One of the most marked differences is
   that the fraction of births to black mothers is much lower in this
   distance category after fracturing begins (and the fraction of births
   to white mothers is correspondingly higher). This difference arises
   because over time, more wells were drilled near urban areas such as
   Pittsburgh where higher numbers of African Americans live.

   A potentially valid approach to estimating the effects of fracturing is
   to use a difference-in-differences estimator that compares “before
   versus after” in the area near fracturing to “before versus after” in
   areas far from a fracturing site. This approach requires that all
   determinants of infant health except fracturing evolve identically in
   the areas near and far from fracturing. Column (7) provides an
   opportunity to gauge the credibility of this approach. It reports the P
   value from a test of the hypothesis that the difference between the
   column (1) and (2) means is equal to the difference between the column
   (3) and (4) means. The results show that using
   difference-in-differences reduces the potential for confounding
   fracking exposure with other determinants of infant health, but
   important differences in the evolution of marriage rates, race,
   education, and age remain. Although we control for all the observable
   factors in our models, these differences suggest that there may also be
   unobserved differences across areas in other factors that could
   influence infant health. This observation motivates the inclusion of
   mother fixed effects in the equation of outcomes as a function of
   potential exposure to a fractured well as shown in Eq. 2 (see Materials
   and Methods).

   Figures 3 and 4 provide an opportunity to investigate the relationship
   between distances from a fracked well and measures of infant health.
   These figures are based on estimation of Eq. 1 (see Materials and
   Methods), except that “Near” is treated as a vector of indicators for
   each 1-km distance increment from a well site, as described above. The
   unaffected group is composed of births to mothers living more than 15
   km away from a well site. The figure also shows the number of births in
   each distance category.

   Fig. 3 Effect of fracturing on low–birth weight, county fixed effects.

   The left y axis of the graph indicates coefficients and confidence
   intervals (CIs) from a version of Eq. 1 in which “Near” is replaced
   with 15 distance indicators representing the proximity of maternal
   residence to well sites; the coefficients represent the in utero effect
   on infant health of hydraulic fracturing (that is, when conception
   occurs after well spud date) at 1-km intervals from the well site. The
   data sources for the regression are all birth certificates issued in
   Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the Pennsylvania DEP Internal
   Operator Well Inventory. We exclude births with missing values for
   gestation length or latitude/longitude of maternal residence. We
   calculate the distance between maternal residence and well sites using
   Vincenty’s formula. The specification includes year fixed effects (FE),
   month of birth FE, and county of maternal residence FE. The following
   demographic controls are also included: mother is married, marital
   status missing, maternal race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic, missing),
   maternal education [no high school (HS), HS diploma, some college,
   college, advanced degree, missing], maternal age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to
   29, 30 to 34, 35+, missing), child is male, child sex missing, and
   child parity (first, second, third, fourth born and higher, parity
   missing). Standard errors are clustered on maternal ID. The right y
   axis plots average yearly births at each distance from a well site.

   Fig. 4 Effect of fracturing on infant health index, county fixed
   effects.

   The left y axis of the graph indicates coefficients and CIs from a
   version of Eq. 1 in which “Near” is replaced with 15 distance
   indicators representing the proximity of maternal residence to well
   sites; the coefficients represent the in utero effect on infant health
   of hydraulic fracturing (that is, conception occurs after well spud
   date) at 1-km intervals from the well site. The data sources for the
   regression are the universe of birth certificates issued in
   Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the Pennsylvania DEP Internal
   Operator Well Inventory. We exclude births with missing values for
   gestation length or latitude/longitude of maternal residence. We
   calculate the distance between maternal residence and well sites using
   Vincenty’s formula. The infant health index ranges from 0 to 1; an
   increase indicates better health. The regression specification includes
   year FE, month of birth FE, and county of maternal residence FE. The
   following demographic controls are also included: mother is married,
   marital status missing, maternal race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic,
   missing), maternal education (no HS, HS diploma, some college, college,
   advanced degree, missing), maternal age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to
   34, 35+, missing), child is male, child sex missing, and child parity
   (first, second, third, fourth born and higher, parity missing).
   Standard errors are clustered on maternal ID. The right y axis plots
   average yearly births at each distance from a well site.

   On the basis of these figures, we conclude that any significant effects
   of fracking exposure occur within 3 km of a well site. It is also
   evident that the largest effects are concentrated within 1 km of the
   fracking site. For example, Fig. 3 shows that the coefficient on the
   indicator for maternal residence within 1 km of a site is approximately
   0.01, indicating a 0.01 percentage point increase in the probability of
   low birth weight relative to people who live 15 km or more away from a
   site. The effect of living 1 to 2 km from a site is near zero, but the
   effect of living 2 to 3 km from a site again appears to be positive.
   Figure 4 suggests that the infant health index is worse at 0 to 1 km
   from a fracking site than at higher distances. There is some
   unavoidable arbitrariness in defining the cutoff at 3 versus 4 km;
   however, it is nevertheless evident from our data that there is little
   justification for including births at further distances in the
   potentially affected group.

   Table 2 reports the results that emerge from the estimation of Eqs. 1
   and 2. The first three columns use 0 to 1 km as the definition of
   “Near,” the next three columns use 1 to 2 km, and the last three
   columns use 2 to 3 km. In each case, the unaffected group is mothers
   who live 3 to 15 km from a site. Hence, we compare mothers at 0 to 1 km
   to mothers at 3 to 15 km, mothers at 1 to 2 km to mothers at 3 to 15
   km, etc. In each group of three columns, the first column reports
   results from fitting Eq. 1 on the entire sample. In columns (2) and
   (3), the sample is restricted to births from mothers who live within 15
   km of a well site, and these columns report on results from Eqs. 1 and
   2, respectively. Each row corresponds to a different birth outcome, so
   that each entry in the table is a separate estimate of coefficient
   a[2]. Note that because the omitted group is held constant in the
   regressions (it is always the mothers who are greater than 3 km and
   less than 15 km from a site), the regressions are not directly
   comparable to Figs. 3 and 4. In Table 2, the standard errors are
   clustered by mother. We have also estimated alternative models
   clustering by county, which yields very similar patterns.
   Table 2. Effect of fracturing on infant health.

   Each coefficient and SE (shown in parentheses) is from a different
   regression and represents the effect on the given infant health outcome
   of in utero exposure to fracturing (when conception occurs after well
   spud date) within the indicated distance. The data sources for the
   regression are all birth certificates issued in Pennsylvania from 2004
   to 2013 and the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well Inventory. We
   calculate the distance between maternal residence and well sites using
   Vincenty’s formula. The infant health index ranges from 0 to 1; an
   increase indicates better health. Each regression specification
   includes region of maternal residence*year FE, year*month of birth FE,
   and county of maternal residence FE. The following demographic controls
   are also included: mother is married, marital status missing, maternal
   race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic, missing), maternal education (no
   HS, HS diploma, some college, college, advanced degree, missing),
   maternal age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35+, missing), child

   fourth born and higher, parity missing). Where indicated, we include a
   vector of maternal ID fixed effects (“mother FE”). “Under 15 km”
   indicates the subset of mothers living less than 15 km from the nearest

   Column (1) suggests that maternal residence within 1 km of an active
   well site that was hydraulically fractured before conception is
   associated with significantly worse infant health outcomes than are
   more distant locations. The estimated effect on the probability of low
   birth weight is large (0.016), relative to the baseline mean incidence
   of low birth weight of 0.065. We also estimate a small but
   statistically significant negative effect on mean birth weight of about
   39 g. It is quite common in the pollution and health literature to find
   a larger effect of pollution on low–birth weight incidence than on
   average birth weight (10–13); this finding is consistent with the
   possibility that any effects are concentrated among lighter, likely
   more vulnerable, infants. Finally, the infant health index also
   suggests a relatively small but statistically significant decline in
   health; the coefficient of −0.054 means that births near a well site
   where hydraulic fracturing began before conception have a −0.054
   standard deviation decline in the health index. Limiting the sample to
   births to mothers living within 15 km, as shown in column (2), has
   little effect on the estimates, despite the sharp reduction in sample
   size.

   Column (3) reports the estimates from fitting the mother fixed effect
   specification (that is, Eq. 2) on the 15-km sample. The inclusion of
   mother fixed effects is very demanding of the data, a circumstance
   reflected in SEs, which are about twice as large as those in columns
   (1) and (2); this increased SE arises because, within the 0- to 1-km
   range, only 594 of the 1798 potentially exposed infants [see column (2)
   of Table 1] have an unexposed sibling in the data. At 2 to 3 km, 10,568
   infants are potentially exposed and 3538 have a sibling in the data—a
   better statistical situation than the 0- to 1-km cohort, but still a
   tiny fraction of the overall number of births. The pattern of the
   coefficients remains qualitatively similar, particularly for the
   incidence of low birth weight.

   The remaining columns report on the same three specifications, except
   that to test the robustness of our results to different definitions of
   “Near,” the “Near” group is defined as those living within a 1- to 2-km
   radius of a well site in columns (4) to (6) and a 2- to 3-km radius
   from a site in columns (7) to (9). These estimates indicate negative
   health effects from fracking, although they are smaller than in the 0-
   to 1-km range. For example, the estimated effects on the incidence of
   low birth weight and on the infant health index are about one-third to
   one-half of the effect size in the 0- to 1-km category. The effects on
   birth weight are smaller and statistically insignificant. When maternal
   fixed effects are added to the models, the estimates are qualitatively
   similar, although generally somewhat smaller, but the increase in the
   SEs means that these estimates are not statistically significant by
   conventional criteria.

   We additionally conducted a series of robustness checks. A potential
   concern is that the analysis is based entirely on a list of wells that
   were active in 2014 and that therefore does not include hydraulically
   fractured wells that were no longer active as of that date. These wells
   were not included because the well data set includes the spud date for
   these wells but does not report when the well became inactive. Hence,
   our baseline analysis could underestimate exposure if the wells were
   active during a woman’s pregnancy but shut down sometime after an
   infant’s birth. As a check, we reestimated the models using the full
   sample of wells, active and inactive; the results are essentially
   unchanged as shown in table S2.

   A further issue is that we have assigned “Exposure” on the basis of
   whether conception occurred after the spud date. Hence, there are some
   women for whom drilling occurred during a pregnancy that began before
   the spud date, and these women are treated as not having been exposed.
   If these women were negatively affected, then the estimates may
   understate the health effects of fracturing. Conversely, if it is
   exposure in the earliest days of the pregnancy that matters, then the
   impacts will be smaller for infants who were only exposed later in the
   pregnancy, and adding these infants to the “exposed” sample will reduce
   the estimated effects. Therefore, we reestimated the models defining
   “Exposure” on the basis of whether the birth (rather than the
   conception) occurred after the spud date. Table S3 reveals that these
   estimates are generally slightly smaller than those in Table 2,
   suggesting that infants exposed early in the pregnancy may suffer the
   most harm; however, the sampling variability makes definitive judgments
   difficult.

   We have also tried adding additional controls for area interacted with
   year to allow for secular changes in infant mortality that vary at a
   very local level. Specifically, because counties are of varying size,
   we overlaid a grid based on 0.5° of longitude and 0.5° of latitude over
   the state of Pennsylvania and estimated a model that included an
   indicator for the square in which the mother resides interacted with
   year of conception. These results are shown in table S4 and are
   qualitatively unchanged, compared to those discussed above.

   In table S5, we attempt to investigate the effects of intensity of
   exposure in the area within 1 km of a residence. For mothers living
   within 1 km of a well site, the median number of well sites is 2.
   Hence, we alter our main specification to distinguish between the
   effect of having at least one active well and the effects of having
   more than two active wells. This is a demanding test of the data, and
   we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the effects are equal
   for births exposed to above the median and below the median number of
   wells.

   Finally, the probability of a low–birth weight birth is only 6.5% in
   this sample. Of relevance to this point, all the estimates have come
   from linear probability models; given the relatively low mean, it may
   be more appropriate to rely on nonlinear estimation approaches. Table
   S6 reports the marginal effects from logit estimation of Eq. 1 on the
   15-km sample and finds that the results are qualitatively similar to
   those from the linear probability model in Table 2.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

   This paper provides evidence of effects of exposure to hydraulic
   fracturing on infant health, using a large-scale analysis of vital
   statistics records from more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania
   during the 2004–2013 period. Overall, the results suggest that the
   introduction of fracking reduces health among infants born to mothers
   living within 3 km of a well site during pregnancy. We find the largest
   effects for mothers living within 1 km of a site—a 25% increase in the
   probability of a low–birth weight birth (<2500 g) and significant
   declines in average birth weight, as well as in an index of infant
   health. There are also reductions in infant health for mothers living
   within 1 to 3 km of a fracking site, but the estimates are about
   one-third to one-half of the size of those for mothers within the 0- to
   1-km band. There is little evidence of health effects at further
   distances, suggesting that health impacts are highly local.

   What do these estimated impacts imply for the affected infants? Studies
   based on large administrative databases have consistently shown that
   low birth weight is a risk factor for numerous negative outcomes,
   including infant mortality, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
   asthma, lower test scores, lower schooling attainment, lower earnings,
   and higher rates of social welfare program participation (19, 20). For
   example, one large-scale study of twin pairs in Norway found that a 10%
   difference in birth weight in their predominantly low–birth weight
   pairs was associated with a 1% difference in the probability of
   graduating from high school and a 1% difference in earnings, with
   outcomes all being better for the higher-weight twin (20).

   Are these effects large or small relative to those found in other
   studies? Many other studies examine the effects of exposure to
   criterion air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide or nitrous oxides,
   rather than the specific types of hazardous air pollutants that have
   been noted near some fracking sites (4–7). For example, a study of the
   installation of EZ Pass toll plazas in New Jersey and Pennsylvania
   showed that EZ Pass was associated with reductions of 40% in CO and 11%
   in NO, which in turn reduced the incidence of low birth weight by 12%
   among mothers living within 2 km of a toll plaza (13). A recent study
   of openings and closings of industrial plants that emit hazardous air
   pollutants, such as benzene (one of the chemicals that has been found
   near fracking sites), suggested that plant operation is associated with
   a roughly 3% increase in the incidence of low birth weight among
   mothers within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the plants (12). Thus, this paper’s
   estimated findings of a 25% increase in the probability of a low–birth
   weight birth within 1 km and smaller effects at larger distances are
   not inconsistent with the findings that have been reported in previous
   studies of the effects of air pollution on fetal health.

   Available data sources allow for some rough estimates of the number of
   births in the United States annually that are at risk from fracking.
   Specifically, we combined data from the National Center for Health
   Statistics (NCHS) on the number of births by county from July 2012
   through June 2013, with data on the number of fractured wells in 2012
   from HPDI, an information services company in the energy industry. The
   NCHS data are only available by county (whereas our Pennsylvania birth
   data have women’s exact addresses), but by assuming a uniform
   distribution of population across counties, we can estimate the number
   of births to women within 1 km of an active well that was hydraulically
   fractured in that year. Although the HPDA data do not have a fracking
   indicator, we infer it by using information on which wells are in tight
   oil or shale gas plays; hydraulic fracturing is generally required for
   the efficient recovery of oil and gas in these areas. These
   calculations suggest that as many as 65,000 infants were potentially
   exposed nationally in this 1-year period because their mothers live
   within 1 km of a well site that is likely to have been fractured.

   The superior data available in Pennsylvania allow us to compare the
   estimated number of births exposed to the actual number of infants
   exposed to fracking during gestation. This comparison suggests that the
   assumption of a uniform distribution of births across counties leads to
   substantial overestimates of the number of infants born within 1 km of
   an active well site that was fractured; presumably, this is because
   fracking occurs in less populated parts of counties where there are
   fewer births per square kilometer. When we scale our national estimate
   downwards using the ratio of estimated to actual exposed births for
   Pennsylvania, we estimate that approximately 29,000 U.S. infants were
   exposed (that is, born to mothers living within 1 km of an active well
   that was fracked) between July 2012 and June 2013. This is about 0.7%
   of the infants born in the United States over that period.

   A limitation of our study is that given the nature of the available
   data, we are constrained to focus on potential exposure to pollution
   (which is determined by the mother’s residential location) rather than
   actual exposure that could be measured with personal monitoring
   devices. In principle, future research could measure the types and
   amounts of chemicals emitted by hydraulic fracturing, the distance that
   those chemicals are transported under normal weather conditions, and
   the likely effects of those specific chemicals on fetal health and on
   the health of children and adults.

   A second limitation of our study is that even starting with the whole
   population of Pennsylvania births, we end up with a relatively small
   sample of children who were potentially exposed to fracking; this small
   effective sample size limits our ability to probe the shape of the
   distance-exposure relationship and also limits our ability to obtain
   precise estimates from models with mother fixed effects.

   A third caveat is that the pathway of exposure was not a subject of our
   study and is not known with certainty. The results of our study are
   consistent with the possibility that very local air pollution, perhaps
   from the multiple diesel generators used at well sites, from chemicals
   used in fracking, or even from truck traffic to and from sites, could
   be a potential key source of exposure. Previous research regarding
   human health effects of exposure to hydraulic fracturing has also
   identified contaminated water as a possible pathway. Although
   industrial activity from hydraulic fracturing and improper disposal of
   fracturing fluids can affect water quality, recent analyses suggest
   that it is not common for fracturing fluids to leak into surface water
   from the fractured well sites (1, 2). Tighter regulation of fluid
   disposal and fracturing activities may have mitigated threats to water
   quality; nevertheless, this potential avenue for deleterious effects on
   human health effects also deserves careful monitoring.

   A fourth caveat is that, to the extent that there are economic benefits
   of fracking that accrue to women who live less than 1 km from a
   fracking site, our estimates could understate the specific effects of
   fracking exposure on human health. If, for example, women living near
   wells receive income from mineral rights, then the higher income per se
   could be expected to confer a health benefit, which might partially
   offset the negative effects of fracking-related pollution.

   Finally, future research should focus on a richer set of outcomes,
   including child health at older ages and adult health. These outcomes
   can be difficult to track, but creative uses of administrative data may
   provide compelling opportunities to more thoroughly investigate the
   local health consequences of exposure to hydraulically fractured well
   sites.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

   The data for this project came from two sources. First, data on all
   births in Pennsylvania were obtained from the Certificate of Live
   Births (birth certificates) from 2004 to 2013. These data include a
   record for every birth, and each record has information about the
   infant’s health at birth as well as latitude and longitude of the
   maternal residence and maternal characteristics such as race,
   education, and marital status. Because we used confidential data, our
   study protocol was vetted by Princeton University’s Institutional
   Review Board. Siblings were matched using the mother’s full maiden
   name, race and birth date, as well as father’s information, and social
   security numbers where available.

   There are many possible health outcomes listed on birth certificates,
   several of which represent rare outcomes. In what follows, we focus on
   birth weight and low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500 g),
   which are the most commonly examined measure of fetal health outcomes
   in the environmental economics literature. Birth weight is commonly
   examined because it has been the most widely available measure, it is
   relatively accurately measured, and low birth weight is quite common
   unlike conditions such as specific congenital anomalies, for example.

   We also show estimated effects on a composite infant health index that
   is constructed to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1, with positive
   (negative) values indicating above (below) average infant health
   (measured in SDs). Our index is suggested by the literature on multiple
   hypothesis testing (17, 18). If there are k outcomes and Y[k] is the
   kth, then let μ[k] be the mean and σ[k] be the SD. We normalize our
   outcomes by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SE: Y[k]* = (Y[k]
   − μ[k])/σ[k]. The summary index is then Y* = Σ[k]Y[k]*/K. We construct
   two versions of this summary index, one using the full sample of births
   and one using the subsample of births within 15 km of a well. The index
   is the mean over the standardized outcomes, weighted by the inverse
   covariance matrix of the transformed outcomes to ensure that outcomes
   that are highly correlated with each other receive less weight than
   those that represent new information.

   The index is a combination of birth weight in grams and indicators for
   low birth weight, prematurity (gestation less than 37 weeks), the
   presence of any congenital anomalies, and the presence of any other
   abnormal condition of the newborn. The index provides a solution to the
   challenges to inference from separately examining the multiple measures
   of infant health (that is, “multiple hypothesis” testing). The problem
   is that the probability that at least one estimated effect is deemed
   “significant” increases with the number of tests. Focusing on an index
   avoids this difficulty. The index is defined so that a larger value
   indicates more positive health.

   We focus on a sample of singleton births because twins and other
   multiples are generally in poorer health at birth for reasons unrelated
   to hydraulic fracturing. After excluding births with missing
   information, we are left with an initial birth sample of 1,125,748
   births, of which 270,410 are within 15 km of a site where a fractured
   well was active in 2014. From the initial sample of 1,449,427 births,
   we lose the following: 55,337 births that were part of a multiple
   birth; 25,029 births that were missing values for gestational age,
   birth weight, congenital anomalies, or abnormal conditions of the
   newborn; 226,548 births that were missing latitude and longitude;
   41,789 births missing a maternal identifier; and 146 duplicate records.
   The sum of the missing categories above exceeds the number of cases
   lost because some cases are missing more than one set of variables.

   The second source of data is a list of all of the fractured wells that
   were active in 2014 in the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well
   Inventory (21). Fractured wells are those marked “unconventional” in
   the database. For each well, we know the location and the date (month
   and year) that it was fractured. There are 7757 active fractured wells
   in our data, the vast majority of which were fractured after 2009.
   Below, we show that the focus on active wells, rather than all fracked
   wells, does not alter the results.

   To match births to fractured gas wells, we computed the distance from
   the mother’s residence to all locations where fracturing ever took
   place between 2004 and 2013, regardless of whether the fracturing had
   yet occurred at the time of the conception. Distances were computed
   using Vincenty’s formula for calculating the distance between two
   points on a sphere. In our sample, there are 24,148 births to mothers
   residing less than 2 km from a site where fracturing ever occurred and
   6669 living within 1 km of a site where fracturing ever occurred; of
   this last group, 1798 births were potentially exposed to active
   fracturing at some point while in utero, because the conception date
   occurred after the date that drilling was initiated (that is, the spud
   date).

   We estimate several different statistical models with and without
   sibling comparisons. Some models are estimated using the entire sample
   of Pennsylvania births, whereas others focus only on births within 15
   km of a well site. The latter sample excludes births in Philadelphia,
   for example, where there is no fracturing and birth outcomes may be
   changing differentially from those in the rest of the state for reasons
   unrelated to the proliferation of fracturing.

   The first specification that we estimate is Embedded Image Embedded
   Image (1)where Y[it] is a birth outcome for mother i in year t.
   County[it] is a vector of zero-one indicators for the mother’s county
   of residence at the time of the birth, Time[it] is a vector of zero-one
   indicators for the birth month and year (for example, October 2006),
   and Regional_trend[it] is a region-specific linear time trend based on
   a division of Pennsylvania into six regions (22). The vector X[it] of
   observable maternal and child characteristics includes indicators for
   child gender, maternal race and ethnicity (African-American, Hispanic,
   missing), mother’s age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35+,
   missing), mother’s education (<high school, high school, some college,
   college, advanced degree, missing), marital status (including an
   indicator for missing marital status), and child parity (first, second,
   third, fourth born or higher, parity missing). One reason for
   controlling for parity is that in our data, the exposed sibling tends
   to be younger than the unexposed sibling in a sibling pair, so that it
   is important to control for birth order effects.

   To develop our measure of exposure, we first define two vectors for
   each birth, each of which contains a separate element/variable for each
   well site observed in the data. The “proximity” vector consists of
   indicator variables for each well site regardless of whether it had
   been fractured at the time of the birth. These indicators are equal to
   1 if the distance between maternal residence and the given well site is
   within a short distance (that is, 0 to 1, 1 to 2, or 2 to 3 km in
   alternative specifications) and 0 otherwise. We then define an
   indicator, Near[i], that is the result of applying the maximum operator
   to the full vector for birth i. That is, if there are any wells within
   the specified radius, then this indicator Near[i] will take the value 1
   and 0 otherwise. This variable is a practical solution to summarizing
   the information on distance associated with each of the nearly 8000
   wells; specifically, it is a measure of whether there is at least one
   well in the relevant distance category and it is a key covariate in Eq.
   1.

   The “timing” vector also has a separate indicator for each well that is
   equal to 1 if conception occurred after the spud date and 0 otherwise.
   The idea is that it is implausible that a well could affect infant
   health before it is spudded. The differences in spud dates across
   wells, even with relatively small geographic areas, mean that it is
   possible to include month-year indicators and region-specific time
   trends to adjust for any underlying time effects.

   Having defined these two vectors, we multiply to create a new vector
   and apply the maximum operator to the product vector. The result is the
   indicator variable Exposure[it], which is equal to 1 for births near
   any well sites for which the spud date precedes conception and is equal
   to 0 otherwise. Thus, after adjustment for the full set of covariates
   described in the preceding paragraphs, the key parameter of interest is
   a[2,] which measures whether there are changes in infant health near
   well sites where hydraulic fracturing started before the conception
   date.

   One reason why birth outcomes might differ in an area before and after
   fracking is that the population of mothers may change with active
   fracturing. Previous work has shown, for example, that housing prices
   can be affected by industrial activity (12, 23, 24), which could be
   expected to change the population living nearby over time. One way to
   deal with this problem is to compare each mother to herself. Hence, we
   next estimate Embedded Image Embedded Image (2)which differs from the
   study of Bamberger and Oswald (4) in that it includes a constant term
   for each mother, a[i]. Because the a[i] absorbs the effect of any
   constant or time invariant characteristics (that is, race, education,
   etc.) of the mother, the vector X′[it] now includes only time-varying
   elements of X[it]. Table S1 reveals that mothers with multiple births
   are more likely to be married and also more likely to have either high
   or low levels of education. Hence, although Eq. 2 removes concerns
   about confounding fracking exposure with other determinants of infant
   health, it is possible that the effects of exposure to fracking differ
   in the subpopulation of mothers with more than one child in the data.

   Three additional details are worth noting. First, there was no a priori
   correct way to define “Near” because there is no physical law that
   determines the distance at which fracking-related activities
   potentially affect infant health. Consequently, we estimated models
   that explore the effect of each additional kilometer of distance from a
   well. These models took the same form as Eq. 1, except that “Near” was
   replaced with a vector of indicators for whether the mother lived 0 to
   1, 1 to 2 km, 2 to 3, …, 10 to 15 km from a well. The omitted distance
   category was greater than 15 km. A mother’s residence can be both 0 to
   1 km from one well and 2 to 3 km from another; hence, these categories
   are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We also calculated 15
   “Exposure” variables analogously to the way these indicators were
   described above; the coefficients associated with these variables test
   for any changes in infant health in these 15 distance bands around well
   sites where hydraulic fracturing started before the conception date,
   relative to the rest of Pennsylvania. We found little evidence of an
   effect of fracking exposure on infant health at distances greater than
   3 km, and this motivated our focus on 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 km as
   the definitions of “Near,” as well as the use of infants born to
   mothers living more than 3 km away as the comparison group.

   A second issue is that secular trends in infant health outcomes may
   differ across small geographic areas (that is, because of hospital
   closings or openings or local economic shocks). For this reason, the
   subsequent analysis reports result from the estimation of versions of
   Eqs. 1 and 2 that limit the sample to a 15-km radius around a well
   site. The advantage of this smaller sample is that mothers living 3 to
   15 km away from a well site may be affected by the same economic shocks
   as those who live within 3 km. In contrast, this assumption seems less
   likely to be valid for mothers living further away, for example in
   Philadelphia. In addition, rather than only allowing time trends to
   vary by region, we also defined a 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude grid
   and controlled for a time trend for each cell in this grid. This
   alternate specification provides a flexible method to adjust for
   secular changes in infant health that are unrelated to fracking
   exposure.

   All models were estimated using the REG and XTREG commands in STATA
   14.0. The SEs in these and all our models were clustered by mother to
   allow for correlations between siblings in other determinants of birth
   outcomes.

Abstract

   The Greenland Ice Sheet holds 7.2 m of sea level equivalent and in
   recent decades, rising temperatures have led to accelerated mass loss.
   Current ice margin recession is led by the retreat of outlet glaciers,
   large rivers of ice ending in narrow fjords that drain the interior. We
   pair an outlet glacier–resolving ice sheet model with a comprehensive
   uncertainty quantification to estimate Greenland’s contribution to sea
   level over the next millennium. We find that Greenland could contribute
   5 to 33 cm to sea level by 2100, with discharge from outlet glaciers
   contributing 8 to 45% of total mass loss. Our analysis shows that
   uncertainties in projecting mass loss are dominated by uncertainties in
   climate scenarios and surface processes, whereas uncertainties in
   calving and frontal melt play a minor role. We project that Greenland
   will very likely become ice free within a millennium without
   substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

INTRODUCTION

   Ice sheets lose mass through runoff of surface meltwater and ice
   discharge into the surrounding ocean, and increases in both over the
   past two decades have resulted in accelerated mass loss from the
   Greenland Ice Sheet (1, 2). Between 1995 and 1998, subsurface ocean
   temperatures rose by about 1.5°C along the west coast of Greenland as a
   result of increasing subsurface water temperatures in the subpolar gyre
   (3). These warm waters led to a disintegration of buttressing floating
   ice tongues (3), which triggered a positive feedback between retreat,
   thinning, and outlet glacier acceleration (outlet glacier–acceleration
   feedback) (4). A stark example is Jakobshavn Isbræ, Greenland’s largest
   and fastest flowing outlet glacier. Following the loss of its floating
   tongue between 2000 and 2003, the glacier’s flow speeds doubled as the
   ice thinned (5, 6). Since then, rapid increases in ice discharge have
   been observed in many outlet glaciers around Greenland, including
   Sverdrup Gletscher and Ummiamaku Isbræ on the northwest coast and Køge
   Bugt and Kangerdlugssuaq Gletscher on the southeast coast (7). Between
   1990 and 2008, surface melt nearly doubled in magnitude, most notably
   in southwest Greenland (8), resulting in additional widespread thinning
   at lower elevations. Thinning lowers the ice surface and exposes it to
   higher air temperatures, thereby leading to enhanced melt (surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback), establishing a second positive feedback
   for mass loss. The existence of such positive feedbacks can lead to
   strongly nonlinear responses of the ice sheet to environmental forcings
   (9).

   As recognized in previous reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change, the ability to track outlet glacier behavior is
   necessary to accurately project ice sheet evolution, yet previous
   studies (10, 11) had limited success due to a lack of accurate ice
   thickness (12), a leading order constraint on ice flow. Consequently,
   major progress was not possible until 2014, when a new high-resolution
   ice thickness map (13) became available that now allows capturing
   outlet glacier flow with high fidelity (12).

   Here, we present a new assessment of the response of the Greenland Ice
   Sheet to future warming using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model [PISM;
   (14)], which is capable of reproducing the complex flow patterns
   evident in Greenland’s outlet glaciers (12). PISM simulates the
   evolution of ice geometry and ice flow. We use three extended
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) emissions scenarios (15):
   a pathway with reduced greenhouse gas emissions that aligns with
   meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement (RCP 2.6), an
   intermediate pathway (RCP 4.5), and a high-emissions pathway (RCP 8.5).
   For these pathways, we derive air temperature anomalies from global
   climate model (GCM) realizations (Fig. 1A), which we use to adjust
   present-day temperatures and precipitation based on climatologies from
   the high-resolution (∼5.5 km) regional climate model HIRHAM5 (16).
   Because most GCM projections are only available until 2300, we extend
   the temperature anomalies by linearly extrapolating the 2200–2300 trend
   to the year 2500 and keeping the 2500 monthly values constant afterward
   (see Materials and Methods). At the ice-ocean interface, we prescribe
   submarine melt (i.e., melt at the ice front and below ice shelves from
   the water in contact) with parameterizations informed by observations
   (17, 18, 19), numerical modeling (20), and theoretical considerations
   (21), and we assume that ocean temperatures rise at the same rate as
   atmospheric temperatures. To estimate the impact of parametric
   uncertainties for each of the three emissions scenarios, we perform a
   rigorous 500-member ensemble of simulations in which we vary 11 key
   model parameters governing atmospheric forcing, surface processes,
   submarine melt, calving, and ice dynamics. In addition, we identify a
   control simulation for each scenario, which we use for inter-scenario
   comparisons.

   the linear 2200–2300 trend was extrapolated to 2500, after which the
   2500 value was kept constant (see Materials and Methods). The area

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Greenland in a thousand years

   In a thousand years, the Greenland Ice Sheet will look significantly
   different than today (Fig. 2). Depending on the emission scenario, the
   Greenland Ice Sheet will have lost 8 to 25% (RCP 2.6), 26 to 57% (RCP
   4.5), or 72 to 100% (RCP 8.5) of its present-day mass, contributing
   0.59 to 1.88 m, 1.86 to 4.17 m, or 5.23 to 7.28 m to global mean sea
   level, respectively, where ranges refer to the 16th and 84th
   percentiles (Fig. 1B and Table 1). We illustrate the range of possible
   ice sheet trajectories by computing the probability, in our 500-run
   ensemble, that a given location is ice covered after 1000 years (Fig.
   2, B to E). The ice sheet following the RCP 2.6 emissions path will
   very likely experience significant margin recession in the west and
   north (Fig. 2B). For the control simulation, ice flow in this ice sheet
   shows patterns similar to present day in the southeast and southwest
   (Fig. 2F). RCP 4.5 results in large retreats around all of Greenland,
   with the exception of high-elevation areas in the east of the southern
   and central domes (Fig. 2C). Fast flow in this reduced ice sheet
   configuration is still topographically concentrated in channels that
   reach below sea level. A wide swath of outlet glaciers feed fjords in
   west-central Greenland, and the contemporary large outlet glaciers of
   northwestern and northeastern Greenland merge into a few ice
   stream–like features (Fig. 2G). For RCP 8.5, 67% of the ensemble
   members lose >90% of the initial volume, and 58% of ensemble members
   lose >99% of initial ice volume, including the control simulation (Fig.
   2D). Evidently, by continuing on the RCP 8.5 path, it is very likely
   that Greenland will become ice free within a millennium.

Partitioning mass loss

   At the beginning of the 21st century, mass loss was roughly equally
   split between surface meltwater runoff and ice discharge (sum of
   mechanical calving and frontal melt) into the surrounding ocean, albeit
   with high year-to-year variations (22). Our simulated mass loss for the
   same period is consistent with this observation (Fig. 1). During the
   21st and 22nd centuries, ice discharge remains a major contributor to
   mass loss regardless of the emissions scenario (Figs. 1, D and E, and
   3), contributing 2 to 39 cm to sea level by 2200, corresponding to 6 to
   45% of the total mass loss. Over time, however, the relative importance
   of ice discharge diminishes, except for RCP 8.5. Under this scenario,
   mass loss is sufficiently large for the ice margin to retreat into
   interior areas below sea level, resulting in large calving fronts and
   increased ice discharge. The exact timing of this increase varies
   across RCP 8.5 ensemble members, resulting in a marked increase in the
   variance of the relative contribution of ice discharge to mass loss at
   the beginning of the 23rd century.

   Fig. 3 Evolution of ice sheet area and mass balance components for the
   control simulation for each RCP scenario.

   (A to C) Ice area evolution. (D to F) Partitioning of ice sheet wide
   mass balance rates into snow accumulation, runoff, and ice discharge
   into the ocean shown in Gt year^−1 (D to F) and kg m^−2 year^−1 (left
   axis) and m year^−1 ice equivalent (right axis) (G to I). We
   distinguish between runoff due to climate warming and runoff due to
   surface elevation lowering. (A) to (I) are plotted as 11-year running
   means.

   In a warming climate, precipitation (and thus snow accumulation) is
   expected to increase because of the higher moisture holding ability of
   warmer air. Here, we increase precipitation by 5 to 7% for each degree
   of warming (23). We find that in our simulations, total snow
   accumulation over the ice sheet remains relatively steady over time for
   RCPs 2.6 and 4.5 (Fig. 3, D and E), since decreasing ice sheet area is
   offset by an increase in snow accumulation per unit area due to
   increasing precipitation (Fig. 3, J and K). Under RCP 8.5, however, the
   decrease in snow accumulation due to accumulation area reduction (Fig.
   3C) outpaces the increase in snow accumulation due to warming, and
   thus, total snow accumulation decreases after around year 2200 (Fig.
   3F). Toward the end of the millennium, snow accumulation per unit area
   increases as the Greenland Ice Sheet is reduced to a few high-elevation
   areas in the southeast (Fig. 3I). For RCP 8.5, ice sheet–wide surface
   meltwater runoff rates decrease after passing a maximum around year
   2500 despite continuously increasing runoff rates per unit area. At the
   time of the maximum, runoff exceeds snow accumulation by a factor of
   about 17. Surface melt is amplified by the positive surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback as surface lowering exposes the ice to
   higher air temperatures. To assess the role of this feedback in driving
   increases in surface melt, we perform a simulation assuming no changes
   in surface elevation for the calculation of the air temperatures (i.e.,
   setting the temperature lapse rate to zero). We find that in all
   scenarios, the increased melt rates per unit area caused by higher air
   temperatures due to climate change exceeds the impact of higher
   temperatures due to surface lowering (Fig. 3, G to I). In our
   simulations, temperatures are kept constant beyond the year 2500, yet
   Greenland continues to lose mass in part because of the surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback. This committed sea level rise (24)
   demonstrates that stabilization of mass change will be more difficult
   as time passes.

Additional feedbacks at play

   Besides the surface mass balance–elevation feedback and the outlet
   glacier–thinning feedback, additional negative and positive feedbacks
   are at play. A negative feedback that can reduce mass loss is
   glacio-isostatic adjustment that results from unloading of the
   lithosphere due to ice loss. The uplift of bedrock is caused by the
   viscoelastic response of the underlying mantle and, as a consequence,
   will reduce the surface area that is exposed to surface melt and the
   ice area in direct contact with ocean water. However, because of the
   high mantle viscosity, this process is relatively slow, causing
   millimeters to centimeters per year rates of uplift. For each RCP
   scenario, we perform a simulation without glacio-isostatic adjustment
   and find that this effect is negligible on the centennial time scale,
   and after a millennium, mass loss is reduced by only about 2%, which is
   much less than the variance of the ensemble simulations on the 16th or
   84th percentile (Table 1).

   Another negative feedback is the coastward advection of deep cold ice,
   which increases ice viscosity and basal stickiness and decreases mass
   loss by reducing flow rates. This feedback competes with the positive
   feedback of inland migration of decreased basal stickiness due to
   outlet glacier acceleration and thinning (fig. S1). Acceleration of
   outlet glaciers not only leads to enhanced ice discharge but also
   contributes indirectly to increased surface runoff via the surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback: Thinning induced by outlet glacier
   acceleration lowers the ice surface in the vicinity of the glacier
   terminus, resulting in enhanced melt. While our model takes these three
   feedbacks into account, their impact is, however, difficult to
   quantify.

   Positive feedbacks that we have not considered, but are potentially
   relevant, are the effect of enhanced surface melt affecting basal
   motion (25), warming of the ice by refreezing of meltwater
   [“cryo-hydrologic warming” (26)], and ice cliff failure (27). These
   three feedbacks, if taken into account, could further increase our mass
   loss estimates. Last, geomorphological processes such as bedrock
   erosion, sediment transport, and deposition could affect ice sheet
   evolution on centennial and longer time scales (28); however, whether
   these processes would amplify or slow down mass loss is not clear (29).

Outlet glacier retreat

   Observations indicate that Greenland’s 200+ major outlet glaciers have
   displayed a marked asynchronicity in retreat behavior (30). Even
   adjacent glaciers that experience similar environmental conditions may
   behave differently because retreat is strongly controlled by glacier
   geometry (31). Our simulations produce similar behavior, as illustrated
   by two examples. In west-central Greenland, Store Gletscher’s current
   extent is strongly controlled by geometry because its terminus resides
   on a local bedrock high, and high frontal melt rates are required to
   thin the glacier to flotation and cause retreat (32). In our
   simulations, once Store Gletscher loses contact with the bedrock high,
   it retreats within a decade or less over a distance of about 25 km
   until it becomes land terminating (Fig. 4). This behavior is observed
   in all three RCP scenarios but occurs later under lower emissions
   scenarios (not shown). Upernavik Isstrøm South, in the same region,
   exhibits a more gradual retreat in the simulations due to a smoother
   bed topography. Both glaciers accelerate during retreat and then slow
   down at stable front positions on bedrock highs while thinning
   continues. Once thinned to flotation at this local high point, the
   glaciers retreat again. In our simulations, both Store Gletscher and
   Upernavik Isstrøm South undergo several episodes of fast retreat.
   During these episodes, maximum speeds are comparable between individual
   episodes, but maximum fluxes (product of ice thickness and vertically
   averaged velocity) decline over time because of thinning, a behavior
   that was also reported by Nick et al. (33).

   Fig. 4 Retreat of two outlet glaciers in a similar climatic setting
   between 2015 and 2315 for the RCP 4.5 scenario.

   (A) Upernavik Isstrøm South (UIS) shows a gradual retreat of about 50
   km over the next 200 years. (B) Store Gletscher (SG) is currently in a
   very stable position on a bedrock high. It takes almost a hundred years
   before substantial retreat happens. However, once the glacier loses
   contact with the bedrock high, retreat of 25 km occurs in less than a
   decade. The glacier retreats quickly until it is out of the water.
   Every line represents a year (A and B). (C) Location of the two outlet
   glaciers on the west coast, present-day observed surface speeds (61),
   and flow lines of Upernavik Isstrøm South and Store Gletscher (white
   dashed lines). Small inset shows area where the two glaciers are
   located.

   Over time, ice sheet–wide ice discharge decreases because of outlet
   glacier thinning and outlet glaciers becoming land terminating (Fig.
   3). Because the flow of outlet glaciers is strongly controlled by
   geometry (34) and most of the submarine channels beneath large outlet
   glaciers extend only to about 100 km inland, their potential for
   sustained fast retreat (and large ice discharge) is limited. Jakobshavn
   Isbræ, Humboldt Gletscher, and Petermann Gletscher, however, have
   channels that extend far into the ice sheet interior (13), and these
   glaciers are responsible for much of the asymmetric retreat (Fig. 2, F
   and G). By the year 2300 (RCP 8.5) or 2500 (RCP 4.5), almost all outlet
   glaciers in northwest Greenland have become land terminating, and ice
   discharge there is greatly reduced. In contrast, in southeast
   Greenland, outlet glaciers retreat substantially only for the RCP 8.5
   scenario, and ice discharge remains an important contributor to mass
   loss even for the RCP 8.5 scenario until the 23rd century. However,
   future ice discharge in the southeast may be underestimated in our
   simulations because of inaccurate subglacial topography. Aschwanden et
   al. (12) already reported poor agreement between observed and modeled
   surface speeds for several glaciers in southeast Greenland and
   attributed the mismatch to poorly constrained ice thickness. This
   hypothesis was recently corroborated by inversion of gravimetric data
   that revealed glacial fjords several hundreds of meters deeper than
   previously assumed (35).

   To characterize the importance of capturing outlet glacier flow, we
   performed a simulation where flow was calculated because of vertical
   shearing at a coarse horizontal grid resolution of 18 km, ignoring
   longitudinal stresses relevant for outlet glacier flow. For RCPs 2.6
   and 4.5, this approach underestimates mass loss by a meter sea level
   equivalent at year 3000 compared to the control simulation (Table 1),
   with a projected mass gain of 25 cm sea level equivalent for RCP 2.6.
   While under RCP 8.5, Greenland will become ice free whether outlet
   glaciers are resolved or not, larger mass loss occurs in the early
   centuries in the control simulation, with the nonresolving simulation
   underestimating mass loss by >10% by the year 2300. Large mass loss in
   early centuries may make a recovery harder, even if climate warming
   were to reverse. Consequently, it is crucial to resolve outlet glaciers
   to reduce uncertainties in mass loss projections.

Uncertainty quantification

   Our large ensemble of simulations allows us to attribute the fraction
   of mass loss uncertainty due to poorly constrained model parameters
   using Sobol indices (36). The sum of Sobol indices must be less than
   unity because the combination of variance produced by all parameters
   simultaneously must be less than the total variance.

   Across all RCP scenarios, we find that 26 to 53% of mass loss
   uncertainty in the 21st century is caused by underconstrained ice
   dynamics parameters, particularly uncertainty in basal motion (Table
   2). This percentage declines to 5 to 38% in the 22nd century and
   steadily decreases to 2 to 33% by the year 2300 (Table 2). Over time,
   uncertainty in ice dynamics explains a progressively smaller fraction
   of mass loss variance, while the uncertainty in climate forcing
   (temperature projections in particular) explains an increasingly large
   fraction of the total ensemble variance, reaching 7 to 45% by the year
   2300. We note that beyond year 2300, the calculated variance is likely
   to underestimate the true variance because temperature projections are
   not available and we instead produce temperature projections via
   extrapolation (see Materials and Methods).
   Table 2 Sobol indices computed from large ensemble of simulations.

   Values represent the percentage of variance in mass loss attributable
   to the variance in a given parameter. Large values imply that
   uncertainty in that parameter is responsible for a commensurately large
   uncertainty in mass loss. Small values imply that uncertainty in a
   given parameter has relatively little effect on uncertainty in total
   mass loss. Numbers for the variance in air temperature for year 3000
   are in parentheses because they do not reflect the GCM intermodel
   variability but the choice of extrapolation.

   Surface processes such as melt and refreezing are the result of a
   complex surface energy balance. Here, we make the first-order
   assumption that melt is proportional to the sum of days with
   temperatures above freezing. While more sophisticated approaches exist,
   they are not computationally tractable on the long time scales and the
   number of ensembles considered here; they also suffer from
   underconstrained parameters (37). We find that uncertainties in surface
   processes are the dominant source of uncertainties across RCPs until
   year 2300, ranging from 14 to 50%. Between melt and refreezing,
   refreezing contributes little to uncertainties in surface processes.

   The mass loss variance explained by uncertainties in submarine melt and
   calving parameters is <5% for all scenarios and at all times. We
   emphasize that this does not necessarily imply that these mechanisms
   are unimportant for ice sheet evolution. Rather, variability in
   parameter values over their plausible ranges produces relatively little
   corresponding variability in simulated mass loss. However, such
   variability can have large regional impacts, and many of the frontal
   mass loss parameters are empirical and based on recent observations.
   Furthermore, basal motion is generally high near marine termini,
   leading to a tight coupling between ocean and basal processes. Thus, it
   may be difficult to separate the variance in mass loss explained by
   basal motion from the variance explained by ocean forcing. Our findings
   suggest that better constraints on basal motion modeling are critical
   for reducing uncertainties in prediction of mass loss over the next two
   centuries, and a reduction in uncertainty of temperature projections
   and for surface mass balance will lead to better predictions of
   Greenland mass loss over multicentennial and longer time scales.

Perspectives

   Our simulations suggest that by following the RCP 8.5 scenario, the
   Greenland Ice Sheet will disappear within a millennium and that the
   contribution of discharge from outlet glaciers will remain a key
   component of mass loss over the next centuries. Better quantification
   of feedbacks that interlink and amplify mass loss processes will help
   in understanding the extent to which these feedbacks make changes in
   the Greenland Ice Sheet nonreversible. Because of these feedbacks,
   delaying mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is likely to increase
   sea level rise, even with future significant reductions of emissions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ice sheet model

   Simulations are performed with the open-source PISM (14), which is
   thermomechanically coupled and polythermal (38) and uses a hybrid
   stress balance (39), making PISM well suited for Greenland (12).
   Horizontal grid resolution ranges from 450 m to 18 km, with the control
   simulations, and the ensemble simulations using resolutions of 900 and
   1800 m, respectively. At the basal boundary, geothermal flux varies in
   space (40), and a pseudoplastic power law relates bed-parallel shear
   stress and sliding; details are given in (12). Compared to (12),
   subglacial topography was updated to version 3; submarine melting at
   vertical ice fronts was implemented; and a new stress-based calving law
   suitable for outlet glaciers was implemented (32). To track the bedrock
   response to a changing ice load, PISM uses the model of the viscous
   half-space overlain by an elastic plate lithosphere (41).

Atmospheric forcing

   The spatial and seasonal distributions of 2-m air temperature [T[0](x,
   y, t)] and precipitation [P[0](x, y, t)] to force PISM are provided by
   the regional climate model HIRHAM5 (16) at a resolution of 0.05 (∼5.55
   km), which was forced at the lateral boundaries using the European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis
   product (42). We use fields of daily mean temperature and total
   precipitation averaged over 2000–2015 (43). Here, both P[0] and T[0]
   are periodic in time with a period of 1 year.

   To perform future simulations, we adjust T[0](x, y, t) by scalar
   temperature anomalies ΔT[air](t) derived from a GCM from the fifth
   phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). As most
   CMIP5 simulations are only available until 2100, we select the four
   GCMs that extend to year 2300: GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and
   MPI-ESM-LR. To calculate ΔT[air](t), we first extract monthly
   near-surface temperature averaged over the domain containing Greenland
   (12°W to 73°W and 59°N to 84°N). We then extend the resulting
   temperature series beyond 2300 by linearly extrapolating the 2200–2300
   trend to the year 2500, after which we keep the 2500 monthly values
   constant. Our choice of linear trend extrapolation is supported by GCM
   simulations with Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE2
   (44). Last, we subtract the 2006–2015 monthly means from the time
   series to create anomalies ΔT[air] (fig. S2). The resulting temperature
   anomalies fall within the ±1σ of the CMIP5 ensemble, which consists of
   27 (RCP 2.6), 38 (RCP 4.5), and 40 (RCP 8.5) model realizations. Future
   air temperatures T(x, y, t) are then computed
   byT(x,y,t)=T0(x,y,t)+ΔTΓ(x,y,t)+ΔTair(t)where ΔT[Γ](x, y, t) is the
   temperature adjustment due to the differences between the time-evolving
   modeled ice surface elevation and the fixed topography used by HIRHAM5
   via a standard atmospheric lapse rate Γ of 6 K km^−1. Precipitation is
   increased as a function of air temperature
   increaseP(x,y,t)=P0(x,y,t)×exp(c⋅ΔTair(t))where the value of c
   corresponds to the change of 5 to 7% per Kelvin (23).

Climatic mass balance

   The ice flow model requires climatic mass balance (i.e., the balance of
   accumulation, melt, and refreezing) as a surface boundary condition for
   mass conservation and temperature for conservation of energy.
   Accumulation is computed from precipitation and 2-m air temperature;
   precipitation falls as snow at temperatures below 0°C and as rain at
   temperatures above 2°C, with a linear transition in between. Surface
   melt is computed by a temperature index model (45), which uses 2-m air
   temperature as input. Melt factors for snow are used if snow or firn is
   exposed at the surface, and melt factors for ice are used otherwise.

   We use a simple firn model that only allows removal of firn. At the
   beginning of the simulation, the firn layer thickness is set to the
   average depth of the 750 kg m^−3 isopycnal calculated by the HIRHAM5
   for the period 2000–2015 after an offline spin-up of the snow and firn
   pack for a 100-year period using the downscaled 1979 ERA-Interim
   atmospheric forcing (fig. S3A) (43). Refreezing and retention of liquid
   water in the firn model is based on the control run parametrization
   given in (43), where the density and cold content of the snow layers
   determine the refreezing capacity. Where firn is present, the firn
   layer thickness is reduced by the amount of melted firn.

Submarine melt

   We define submarine melt as the sum of melt occurring at front of
   marine terminating outlet glaciers and melt below ice shelves. Frontal
   melt is primarily controlled by subglacial discharge and thermal
   forcing, as supported by observations (18, 46), numerical modeling
   (20), and theoretical considerations (21). We parameterize the
   present-day submarine melt rate ṁxo using a linear function of
   latitude L between 71°N and
   80°Nṁxo(L)={ṁ71,L<71°ṁ71+19(L−71)(ṁ80−ṁ71),71°≤L≤80°,ṁ80,L>80°whe
   re the values of ṁ71 and ṁ80 were chosen using the following
   observations. At Jakobshavn Isbræ (69°10′N, 49°50′W), Motyka et al.
   (17) estimated an area-averaged subshelf melt rate of 228 ± 49 m
   year^−1 in 1985 with an increase of 57 ± 12 m year^−1 afterward;
   however, melt rates close to the grounding line are considerably higher
   than area averages. August 2010 frontal melt rates at Store Glacier
   (70°22′N, 50°8′W) were 1100 ± 365 m day^−1 (18). Inferred contemporary
   subshelf melt rates at Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79 North Glacier; 79°0′N,
   20°0′W) are 13.3 ± 4 m year^−1, whereas at Zachariæ Isstrøm (78°0′N,
   30°0′W), melt rates increased from 14.6 ± 4.1 m year^−1 (1999–2010) to
   25 ± 12 m year^−1 (2010–2014) (19). To capture the observed spatial and
   temporal variability and associated uncertainties, we consider three
   scenarios: “LOW”: (ṁ71,ṁ80)=(300,10) m year^−1, “MID”:
   (ṁ71,ṁ80)=(400,20) m year^−1, and “HIGH”: (ṁ71,ṁ80)=(500,30) m
   year^−1.

   The parameterization of the temporal variability is inspired by Xu et
   al. (18), who calculate submarine melt ṁ as a function of subglacial
   discharge Q[sgl] and thermal forcing T[h]ṁ=(AQsglα+B)⋅Thβ(1)with 0.5 ≲
   α ≲ 1 and 1 ≲ β ≲ 1.6 (18). From Eq. 1, we derive an expression for
   submarine melt anomalies ṁto(ΔTair) as a function air temperature
   anomalies ΔT[air](t). First, we assume subglacial discharge Q[sgl] to
   equal surface meltwater runoff Q[r]. Second, we express Q[r] as
   function of air temperature anomalies ΔT[air](t). We fit a linear
   function Q[r] = aT[a] + b (a = 0.50, b = 0.8, r^2 = 0.93) (fig. S3C)
   through mean summer (June-July-August) derived air temperatures T[a]
   and surface meltwater runoff Q[r] extracted from simulations with the
   regional climate model MARv3.5.2 2006–2100 forced with CanESM2, MIROC5,
   and NorESM2, each with the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios (47). Last, we
   express the thermal forcing T[h] in terms of ΔT[air]. While the ocean
   warms slower than the atmosphere, we ignore this lag and assume that
   ocean thermal forcing T[h] increases by 1 K for every 1-K increase in
   air temperature. We thus scale submarine melt by a function of
   temperature anomalies
   ΔT[air]ṁ(x,y,t)=ṁxo(L(x,y))⋅ṁto(ΔTair(t)),ṁto(ΔTair)=1+C(aΔTair)αΔT
   airβ

   We use three scenarios for m˙to: LOW uses α = 0.5 and β = 1.0, MID uses
   α = 0.54 and β = 1.17, and HIGH uses α = 0.85 and β = 1.61. We tuned C
   = 0.15 so that for a warming of ΔT[air] = 8 K, submarine melt rates
   increase by a factor of ≈6 to 24 m year^−1 to 3000 to 12,000 m year^−1,
   which should be viewed as an upper bound (fig. S4D).

Calving

   Calving, using a von Mises yield criterion, occurs when the maximum
   tensile stress exceeds σ[max] (32). In addition, calving occurs below a
   minimum floating ice thickness, motivated by the following
   observations. In 2008, only six perennial ice shelves remained
   [Petermann Gletscher, Steensby Gletscher, Ryder Gletscher,
   Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79 North), Zachariæ Isstrøm, and Storstrømmen],
   all north of 76°N. Minimum shelf thickness near the calving front of
   these shelves ranges from 60 to 100 m (13). In contrast, Jakobshavn
   Isbræ’s (69°10′N, 49°50′W) floating tongue had a minimum thickness of
   ∼600 m at the calving front (17). Guided by these observations, we
   prescribe the minimum floating ice thickness h[min] as a linear
   function of latitude between 74°N and 76°N. South of 74°N and north of
   76°N, values are kept constant at h[74] and h[76], respectively. To
   capture the observed spatial and temporal variability and associated
   uncertainties, we consider three scenarios; LOW: h[min] = (h[74],
   h[76]) = (400,50) m, MID: h[min] = (h[74], h[76]) = (500,100) m, and
   HIGH: h[min] = (h[74], h[76]) = (600,150) m.

Ice dynamics

   Aschwanden et al. (12) performed a thorough calibration of parameters
   related to ice dynamics, such that simulated surface speeds agree well
   with observed winter 2008 speeds (48), and we adopt these parameters.
   The two key parameters here are the Shallow Ice Approximation
   enhancement factor and the exponent of the sliding law. The enhancement
   factor E appears in the effective viscosity of glacier ice,
   η2η=(E A)−1(τe2+ε2)1−n2n(2)where τ[e] is the effective stress, A is the
   enthalpy-dependent rate factor, and n is the exponent of the power law.
   The small constant ε (units of stress) regularizes the flow law at low
   effective stress, avoiding the problem of infinite viscosity at zero
   deviatoric stress. The pseudoplastic power law (49) relates
   bed-parallel shear stress t[b] and the sliding velocity
   u[b]tb=−τc ub∣ub∣(1−q)u0q(3)where τ[c] is the yield stress, q is the
   pseudoplasticity exponent, and u[0] = 100 m year^−1 is a threshold
   speed. We assume that yield stress τ[c] is proportional to effective
   pressure N [“Mohr-Coulomb criterion” (50)]τc=(tanϕ) N(4)where ϕ is the
   till friction angle and the effective pressure N is given in (51,
   52)N=δPo10(e0/Cc)(1−(W/Wmax))(5)

   Here, δ = 0.02 is a lower limit of the effective pressure, expressed as
   a fraction of overburden pressure, e[0] is the void ratio at a
   reference effective pressure N[0], C[c] is the coefficient of
   compressibility of the sediment, W is the effective thickness of water,
   and W^max is the maximum amount of basal water. We use a nonconserving
   hydrology model that connects W to the basal melt rate B˙b
   (51)∂W∂t=B˙bρw−Cd(6)where ρ[w] is the density of water and C[d] = 1 mm
   year^−1 is a fixed drainage rate. The basal stickiness β is a measure
   of the glacier bed’s resistance to basal motion and is defined
   asβ=τc∣ub∣(1−q)u0q(7)

Ice sheet initial conditions

   Ice sheet initial conditions are provided by the “calibrated”
   experiments in (12), which includes a 125-ka paleoclimate simulation
   followed by calibration of ice dynamical parameters to minimized
   differences between observed (48) and simulated surface velocities.
   Using this as a starting point, we then ran a 100-year long relaxation
   simulation to account for differences/updates in model physics, but we
   kept the ice surface close to observations using a flux correction
   (12). The result was an initial state that is both close to the
   observed geometry (53) and surface speeds (48) of 2008. On the time
   scale considered here, predictions of ice sheet behavior are similar to
   climate forecasts where initial conditions have little impact on the
   long-term evolution (54). The bedrock deformation model is initialized
   with present-day subglacial topography (13) and viscous uplift rates
   (fig. S3B) (55).

Ensemble analysis

   Many physical processes governing ice sheet evolution are not precisely
   constrained. To assess the sensitivity of volume change estimates to
   these uncertainties, we performed a large ensemble of simulations, with
   11 key parameters drawn from a priori probability distributions of
   plausible values (table S2). Instead of probing such a large parameter
   space, for each RCP scenario, we produced 500 parameter combinations
   using Latin hypercube sampling (56), which ensures that the ensemble is
   optimally representative of the joint distribution of parameters, while
   gaining efficiency relative to factorial or Monte Carlo designs by
   eliminating potential redundancies. We vary parameters drawn from five
   broadly defined groups: (i) Climate: We select the four GCM projections
   with equal probability and model the percentage increase in
   precipitation per 1 K increase in air temperature, ω, as a uniform
   distribution bounded by 5 and 7% K^−1 (23). (ii) Surface processes:
   Parameters governing the interaction between the climate and the ice
   sheet surface mass balance include a positive degree-day ice melt
   factor f[i], positive degree-day snow melt factor f[s], and refreezing
   proportion ψ. Literature values for the ice melt factor f[i] range from
   8 to 40 mm K^−1 day^−1 (57, 58); however, a comparison with the mean
   2000–2015 surface mass balance simulated with HIRHAM5’s energy balance
   model reveals that values ≫8 mm K^−1 day^−1 significantly overestimate
   melt (not shown). We thus use a truncated normal distributions with
   mean μ = 8 mm K^−1 day^−1 and SD σ = 4 mm K^−1 day^−1. For the snow
   melt factor f[s], we also use a truncated normal distribution with a
   mean μ = 4.1 mm K^−1 day^−1 and an SD of 1.5 mm K^−1 day^−1 (59). The
   amount of annual snow fall that is allowed to refreeze ψ is also
   modeled as a truncated normal, but with a mean μ = 50% and SD σ = 20%
   to cover reported literature values (60). (iii) Ocean: We specify three
   suites of parameters corresponding to low, moderate, and high regimes
   for both the spatial m˙x and the temporal m˙t variability in submarine
   melt. These parameter suites are sampled with equal probability. We
   specify three suites of parameters corresponding to low, moderate, and
   high regimes of minimum shelf thickness h[min]. These three scenarios
   are selected with equal probability. The maximum tensile stress of a
   marine terminus σ[max] is modeled as a normal distribution
   symmetrically truncated above 1.4 MPa and below 0.7 MPa (32). (iv) Ice
   dynamics: Aschwanden et al. (12) performed a calibration of ice
   dynamical parameters and found values of q = 0.6 for the exponent of
   the sliding law and E = 1.25 for the shallow ice enhancement factor to
   result in good agreement with observed flow speeds. Here, we use a
   truncated normal distribution for q with μ = 0.6 and σ = 0.2, whereas E
   is modeled with a γ distribution centered around 1.25.

   To attribute uncertainties in mass loss to parametric uncertainties, we
   compute main-effect Sobol indices for each input variable (36).
   Main-effect Sobol indices can be interpreted as the fraction of output
   variance that is explained by the variance in a given input parameter,
   neglecting second-order effects due to parameter interactions. Thus,
   the Sobol indices produced for a given output (in our case total mass
   change) always sum to less than unity. Typically, a large fraction of
   unity signifies that interactions between parameter uncertainty are of
   second-order importance.

Additional simulations

   We also identified an optimal (control) simulation (CTRL) that best
   reproduces the 2000–2015 mean surface mass balance calculated by
   HIRHAM5. To characterize model behavior, we performed additional
   simulations at horizontal grid resolutions ranging from 450 m (G450) to
   18 km (G18000) and found that outlet glacier behavior is well captured
   at horizontal grid resolutions less than 2 km (fig. S4), in agreement
   with (12). The simulation at 450 m was only performed for RCP 4.5 from
   2008 until 2200 because of large file sizes. We also performed two
   additional simulations at a resolution of 900 m, one without
   glacio-isostatic adjustment (“NGIA”) and one without a lapse rate
   (“NTLR”). We used the surface meltwater runoff from the NTLR simulation
   to approximate the meltwater runoff due to anomaly air temperature
   warming. To characterize the importance of resolving outlet glacier
   flow, we performed a simulation that calculates flow due to horizontal
   shearing only at a horizontal grid resolution of 18 km (SIA18000).

Abstract

   Variations in Earth’s orbit pace the glacial-interglacial cycles of the
   Quaternary, but the mechanisms that transform regional and seasonal
   variations in solar insolation into glacial-interglacial cycles are
   still elusive. Here, we present transient simulations of coevolution of
   climate, ice sheets, and carbon cycle over the past 3 million years. We
   show that a gradual lowering of atmospheric CO[2] and regolith removal
   are essential to reproduce the evolution of climate variability over
   the Quaternary. The long-term CO[2] decrease leads to the initiation of
   Northern Hemisphere glaciation and an increase in the amplitude of
   glacial-interglacial variations, while the combined effect of CO[2]
   decline and regolith removal controls the timing of the transition from
   a 41,000- to 100,000-year world. Our results suggest that the current
   CO[2] concentration is unprecedented over the past 3 million years and
   that global temperature never exceeded the preindustrial value by more
   than 2°C during the Quaternary.

INTRODUCTION

   The Quaternary is characterized by the appearance of
   glacial-interglacial cycles caused by the cyclic growth and decay of
   continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Before the
   initiation of NH glaciation at ~2.7 million years (Ma) ago, as
   indicated by the appearance of ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic,
   the growth of NH ice sheets was probably suppressed by elevated
   atmospheric CO[2] (1, 2). Afterward, benthic δ^18O records (3) show a
   trend toward larger ice sheets and colder climate over the Quaternary,
   together with an increase in the amplitude of the glacial-interglacial
   variability (4). Of particular interest is the transition between ~1.25
   and ~0.7 Ma ago, known as the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) (5–7),
   from mostly symmetric cycles with a period of about 41 thousand years
   (ka) to strongly asymmetric 100-ka cycles. Several hypotheses for the
   mechanism of the MPT have been proposed. One of them invokes a gradual
   decline of CO[2] during the past 3 Ma to explain both the onset of
   Greenland (2, 8) and, more generally, NH glaciations (1) and the MPT
   transition (9–11). Another hypothesis attributes the MPT to a gradual
   removal of a thick regolith layer from North America and northern
   Europe (12–14).

   The atmospheric CO[2] concentration is accurately known only for the
   past ~800 ka, the period covered by ice core data. Nevertheless,
   proxy-based reconstructions suggest that, over the past ~2 Ma, CO[2]
   was not very different from the concentrations measured in ice cores
   (15–17) but that it was substantially higher during the late Pliocene
   (18, 19).

   It has been postulated that NH continents were all covered by regolith
   before the Quaternary, an expected outcome of the 10^7 to 10^8 years
   that the bedrock was exposed to weathering before the initiation of
   glacial cycles (7). The observed present-day regolith distribution (20,
   21), which is characterized by exposed bedrock over large parts of
   northern North America and Eurasia, is a result of glacial erosion by
   Quaternary ice sheets. A gradual removal of regolith by glacial erosion
   could have changed the ice sheets’ response to orbital forcing. Changes
   in regolith distribution may affect glacial cycles through several
   mechanisms. The first one is based on the fact that, in the case of
   temperate-base ice sheets, the sliding velocity of ice is much higher
   in the presence of a thick regolith layer as compared to exposed rocks
   (12). This makes ice sheets more mobile, thinner, and more susceptible
   to orbital forcing. In addition to this mechanism, Ganopolski and Calov
   (13) also found that, in the case when ice sheets expand well into
   areas covered by regolith, enhanced deposition of glaciogenic dust over
   the southern margins of NH ice sheets substantially lowers snow albedo,
   thereby facilitating melting and preventing growing of large ice
   sheets.

   It has been shown that modeling of long (100 ka) and strongly
   asymmetric glacial cycles of the late Quaternary requires both the
   presence of large areas of northern continents with exposed rocks and a
   relatively low atmospheric CO[2] concentration (13, 22, 23). Here, we
   investigate the origin of the major transitions in Quaternary climate
   dynamics by performing a large set of transient simulations with the
   Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 (24).

RESULTS

Transient model simulations

   CLIMBER-2 includes atmosphere, ocean, vegetation, global carbon, and
   dust models and the three-dimensional thermomechanical ice sheet model
   SICOPOLIS (25). It has been recently applied for simulating the last
   four glacial cycles with a fully interactive carbon cycle (26). There,
   we demonstrated that glacial lowering of atmospheric CO[2] in the model
   is controlled by lowered sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and changes in
   ocean circulation, in particular enhancement of Antarctic bottom waters
   and decrease of deep ocean ventilation. Elevated carbonate weathering
   on exposed shelves and enhanced nutrient utilization in the Southern
   Ocean due to enhanced dust deposition also play important roles,
   especially toward glacial maxima (27). Reorganizations of the Atlantic
   meridional overturning circulation during glacial terminations
   contribute substantially to deglacial CO[2] rise. The terrestrial
   carbon cycle, which includes novel components such as permafrost
   carbon, peat, and carbon buried under ice sheets, plays a minor role in
   atmospheric CO[2] dynamics on orbital time scales (26).

   To perform multiple simulations covering the entire Quaternary, we use
   a novel technique of splitting long-term simulations over the past 3 Ma
   into shorter intervals. In total, we perform more than 1000 model
   simulations, each 500 ka long, starting from the same initial
   conditions but at different points in time (Materials and Methods and
   fig. S1). This approach allows us to analyze the robustness of glacial
   cycles by testing whether different simulations converge to the same
   solution, and also has the advantage that it reduces the potential
   problem with long-term model drifts in the global carbon cycle. Model
   drifts can occur because, in our modeling setup, the carbon cycle is
   not closed. There are geologic sinks (burial in ocean sediments) and
   sources (carbonate weathering and volcanic CO[2] outgassing), and even
   a tiny imbalance between them can cause a pronounced drift toward too
   high or too low CO[2] concentrations on time scales of millions of
   years.

CO[2] outgassing and regolith scenarios

   To test the effect of a gradual CO[2] decrease on Quaternary climate
   dynamics, we use prescribed volcanic CO[2] outgassing to control the
   mean CO[2] concentration in the model. Small changes in volcanic
   outgassing represent a possible candidate to explain a long-term CO[2]
   decrease, because even the value for the current volcanic outgassing is
   very uncertain (28). Alternatively, the same trend in CO[2] can be
   explained by a similarly small increase in average weathering rate
   and/or organic carbon burial in deep-sea sediments (29).

   On the basis of the evidence for CO[2] decrease and regolith removal
   over the Quaternary, we created different scenarios for CO[2]
   outgassing and regolith distribution, which were then used to drive the
   model together with orbital variations (see Materials and Methods; Fig.
   1, B and C; and fig. S3). The need for these scenarios originates from
   the absence of appropriate models that can be used to simulate the
   evolution of these two factors on the million-year time scale. The
   initial and final values of volcanic outgassing are determined using an
   inverse modeling approach (see Materials and Methods), while the
   initial and final spatial distributions of regolith are either known
   from observation or strongly constrained by empirical data. Therefore,
   the scenarios differ only in their temporal evolution (Fig. 1, B and
   C). For each of the 16 different combinations of regolith and volcanic
   outgassing scenarios, we run the model over the past 3 Ma using the
   time-splitting technique and selected the best scenario by minimizing
   the difference between simulated and observed benthic δ^18O (Fig. 1D;
   see also Materials and Methods) (3).

   The optimal scenarios, those minimizing root mean square error and
   maximizing correlation, are indicated by the white circles in (D) and
   by the thicker lines in (B) and (C).

Transient simulations with optimal CO[2] outgassing and regolith scenarios

   When the model is driven by orbital variations and the optimal regolith
   and volcanic outgassing scenarios, it reproduces the evolution of many
   reconstructed characteristics of Quaternary glacial cycles (Fig. 2). It
   simulates most of the details of the observed benthic δ^18O curve (Fig.
   2A), including long-term trends and glacial-interglacial variability.
   The relative contribution of deep-sea temperature and sea-level
   variations to δ^18O variability changes substantially through time,
   with temperature variations being more important during the early
   Quaternary and sea-level variations dominating the signal during the
   late Quaternary (Fig. 3). The model also captures the secular cooling
   trend of ~−1°C/Ma in SSTs (Fig. 2E). The intensification of NH
   glaciation after ~2.7 Ma ago is marked by a rather abrupt increase in
   global ice volume variations (Fig. 2B) and an increase in ice flux from
   the Laurentide ice sheet into the North Atlantic, in good agreement
   with a proxy for ice-rafted debris (Fig. 2C) (30). Interglacial
   atmospheric CO[2] concentrations decrease from values of ~350 parts per
   million (ppm) during the late Pliocene to values between 260 and 290
   ppm, typical of the past 800 ka, at ~1 Ma ago (Fig. 2D). The amplitude
   of glacial-interglacial CO[2] variations increases from ~50 ppm at the
   beginning of the Quaternary to ~80 to 90 ppm during the 100-ka cycles
   of the past million years. This suggests that, for the early
   Quaternary, the large spreading between and within different CO[2]
   reconstructions markedly overestimates real CO[2] variability. In
   agreement with (17), a substantial fraction of the increase in the
   magnitude of glacial-interglacial CO[2] changes is attributed to a
   larger contribution of the iron fertilization mechanism, which, in
   turn, is related to an increase in dust deposition rate over the
   Southern Ocean during late Quaternary glacial cycles (Fig. 2G). Various
   previous modeling studies have attempted to derive continuous CO[2]
   records for the pre–ice core time using different methods and
   assumptions. van de Wal et al. (31) derived CO[2] concentrations that
   are substantially lower than our estimates for the late Pliocene and
   early Quaternary, with values never exceeding 300 ppm (fig. S6B). The
   more recent reconstruction by (32) shows a much larger glacial
   interglacial variability, particularly before the MPT, compared to our
   results. The CO[2] scenario that we derived for the
   Pliocene-Pleistocene between 3 and 2.4 Ma ago in a previous study (1)
   is comparable to the results presented in this study (fig. S6B). During
   the late Pliocene, simulated global surface air temperature varies by
   less than 1°C in response to variations in Earth’s orbit, with
   interglacial temperatures ~1.5°C warmer than at preindustrial (Fig.
   2F). Successively, glacial-interglacial temperature variability
   gradually increases, reaching values up to ~6°C during the past million
   years. Simulated global temperatures never exceed 2°C above the
   preindustrial over the past 3 Ma (Fig. 2F). At ~1 Ma ago, the main
   periodicity of modeled δ^18O variations changes from 41 to 100 ka (Fig.
   4). Before that, the model mostly responds to obliquity forcing at the
   41-ka period, in agreement with data (Fig. 4). However, the model shows
   a larger response to precession than is observed, possibly because of a
   missing dynamic Antarctic ice sheet in the model (33) or because the
   benthic δ^18O stack is orbitally tuned to obliquity (3). SST, CO[2],
   and sea level show a similar transition from 41 to 100 ka (fig. S5).
   The ice sheets are generally thinner before compared to after the MPT
   (Fig. 5), but the pre- and post-MPT maximum areal ice extent is
   comparable over Scandinavia and eastern North America, broadly in
   accordance with available observations (7). The model results are
   compared to additional observations in fig. S6.

   Modeled maximum ice thickness in each grid cell (A) before and (B)
   after the MPT. The dotted lines in (B) indicate the reconstructed ice
   extent at the last glacial maximum.

   The fact that our model has problems at simulating the strong glacial
   cycle between 500 and 400 ka ago is not surprising because it occurred
   during a period of very weak orbital forcing. There were so far only
   few attempts to simulate this period of time with sufficiently
   realistic climate–ice sheet models (9, 34), and they all reveal
   problems with simulation of this time interval, suggesting that current
   climate–ice sheet models are not nonlinear enough to properly simulate
   this challenging interval.

Robustness of glacial cycles

   The question of whether glacial cycles are deterministic or stochastic
   has been highly debated, and a complete spectrum of opinions—from
   chaotic to perfectly deterministic—exists (35–37). In most cases, our
   model simulations that started at different points in time converge to
   one and the same solution (Fig. 2 and fig. S1), close to
   reconstructions, providing a strong indication that glacial cycles are
   robust. The glacial cycles of the 41-ka world are particularly robust,
   which is expected because they represent a relatively linear response
   to variations in obliquity (4). The 100-ka cycles appear to be less
   robust, because they involve a much more nonlinear response to orbital
   forcing. However, the good agreement between the bulk of the model
   simulations and the reconstructed glacial cycles evolution over the
   past 1 Ma (Fig. 2A), except for MIS11, indicates that the observed
   realization was the most likely, although not the only possible one.
   This finding is fully consistent with that of Tzedakis et al. (35), who
   demonstrated that the most probable timing of the most recent glacial
   terminations is close to that seen in paleoclimate records.

Separate effects of CO[2] outgassing and regolith scenarios

   To assess the influence of the different factors on Quaternary glacial
   cycles, we performed a set of additional experiments where we fixed
   regolith distribution and/or volcanic outgassing to present-day
   conditions. When the model is driven by orbital variations as the only
   external forcing (Fig. 1A), modeling results and data diverge markedly
   before the MPT, with the model simulating pronounced 100-ka cycles
   throughout the whole 3 Ma (Fig. 6A). These results confirm that orbital
   forcing alone cannot explain the evolution in Quaternary glacial
   cycles. When the optimal regolith removal scenario (Fig. 1B) is
   prescribed additionally to orbital forcing, but volcanic outgassing is
   held constant, the model simulates a transition from 41- to 100-ka
   cycles (Fig. 6B), with the precise timing of this transition depending
   on the regolith removal scenario (fig. S4). At the same time, these
   simulations fail to reproduce the general increase in δ^18O between 3
   and 1 Ma ago (Fig. 6B) and the reconstructed global cooling trend in
   SSTs (fig. S8D). Last, a decrease in volcanic CO[2] outgassing (Fig.
   1C), together with orbital forcing but with the prescribed present-day
   regolith cover, captures the trends in δ^18O (Fig. 6C) and SSTs (fig.
   S2C). It can also explain a transition from 41- to 100-ka glacial
   cycles, but for any plausible CO[2] scenario, this transition occurs
   much earlier than in reality (fig. S2).

DISCUSSION

   Our transient modeling results demonstrate that both previously
   proposed mechanisms—regolith removal and gradual lowering of CO[2]—are
   essential to reproduce the realistic evolution of climate variability
   during the Quaternary, and their combination controls the timing of
   regime changes of climate variability. Note that a gradual change of
   the regolith cover causes a rather rapid (few hundred thousand years)
   transition from the 41- to 100-ka world, in good agreement with
   observational data. Simulated glacial cycles only weakly depend on
   initial conditions and therefore represent a quasi-deterministic
   response of the Earth system to orbital forcing. Our results also
   support the notion that the current CO[2] concentration of more than
   400 ppm is unprecedented over at least the past 3 Ma and that global
   temperature did not exceed the preindustrial value by more than 2°C
   during the Quaternary. In the context of future climate change, this
   implies that a failure in substantially reducing CO[2] emissions to
   comply with the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming well
   below 2°C will not only bring Earth’s climate away from Holocene-like
   conditions but also push it beyond climatic conditions experienced
   during the entire current geological period.

   The results of our study are based on an Earth system model of
   intermediate complexity, whose high computational efficiency needed for
   simulations on a million-year time scale is achieved by using a rather
   coarse spatial resolution and considerable simplifications in the
   description of individual processes, in particular atmospheric
   dynamics. Further progress in understanding of Quaternary climate
   dynamics would require the use of complex Earth system models. However,
   moving Quaternary modeling to a qualitatively new level would require
   not only the use of existing complex models but also substantial
   progress in modeling of ice sheet–solid Earth interaction (38) and, in
   particular, its impact on long-term landscape evolution, sediments
   transport (21), global dust and carbon cycles, and other processes that
   are not yet properly understood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Model

   For this study, we used the Earth system model of intermediate
   complexity CLIMBER-2 (24), which incorporates the three-dimensional
   thermomechanical ice sheet model SICOPOLIS (25). SICOPOLIS is a shallow
   ice approximation model, which treats marine ice by allowing grounded
   ice to propagate over the continental shelf. This enables the model to
   resemble to a good approximation the Earth ice cover during the
   Quaternary, including grounded marine ice, which is a considerable
   portion of the northern European ice cover during cold phases.
   SICOPOLIS is applied only to the NH with a spatial resolution of 1.5° ×
   0.75° and is fully interactively coupled to the low-resolution climate
   component and a model of deep permafrost (39). Meltwater and iceberg
   fluxes directly affect ocean circulation. Forced by orbital variations
   and prescribed radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, the model has
   been applied to simulate the last eight glacial cycles (13). CLIMBER-2
   also includes a global carbon cycle model (27) and has been the first
   model to reproduce the main characteristics of the last four glacial
   cycles with orbital forcing as the only prescribed external forcing
   (26). Because CLIMBER-2 does not include methane and nitrous oxide
   cycles and does not account for these greenhouse gases in its radiative
   scheme, we made use of the fact that CO[2] is the dominant greenhouse
   gas and that, on orbital time scales, variations of the other two
   follow rather closely CO[2] during the past 800 ka (40). To account for
   the effect of methane and nitrous oxide on radiative forcing, we
   computed the effective CO[2] concentration used in the radiative scheme
   of the model in such a way that radiative forcing of equivalent CO[2]
   exceeds radiative forcing of simulated CO[2] by 30% at any time (26).
   Unlike the previous model version, the model used in this study also
   includes a fully interactive dust cycle model (41), with the
   atmospheric dust load directly affecting the shortwave radiative
   balance of the atmosphere and dust deposition on snow reducing surface
   albedo. Benthic δ^18O is estimated from the modeled sea level, z[SL],
   and deep ocean temperature, T[d], as follows: δ^18O = 4.0 − 0.22 T[d] −
   0.01 z[SL]. The temperature sensitivity factor is from (42), and the
   sea-level factor is from (43). Sea level is computed from the volume of
   modeled NH ice sheets assuming an additional 10% contribution from
   Antarctica. It has to be noted that this assumption rules out possible
   canceling NH/Southern Hemisphere precessional-phase contributions for
   δ^18O and sea level (33).

   The SST used to compare the stack of (18) is computed as the annual
   average SST of the model grid cells that contain the sediment cores
   from which the stack of (18) was derived. The SST computed this way
   turns out to differ substantially from the global SST in the model,
   particularly in the long-term trend.

Transient simulations, splitting in time technique

   We then used CLIMBER-2 to perform transient simulations of the past 3
   Ma. In principle, it would be possible to perform one single transient
   simulation from 3 Ma ago to the present, but this would be impractical
   because of the long time (more than a month) it would take for a
   complete simulation. In addition, even very small imbalances in the
   carbon cycle would cause the model to drift away on such long time
   scales. We therefore applied a splitting in time technique, which
   consists of running many model simulations for 500 ka starting at
   different times from 3.25 Ma ago until 150 ka ago at time intervals of
   100 ka. For all runs, the model was initialized using identical
   preindustrial interglacial conditions as described in (26). All model
   runs were thus started from the same initial state of the
   climate-carbon cycle–ice sheet system, but with differing orbital
   configuration, regolith distribution, and volcanic CO[2] outgassing
   according to the initial astronomical time. We then discarded the
   initial 100 ka of each simulation as model spin-up and analyzed the
   remaining 400 ka (fig. S1).

   The application of the time-splitting method generates an ensemble of
   model simulations that are (partly) overlapping in time and may not
   necessary converge to the same solution at all points in time. However,
   for spectral and wavelet analysis, a continuous time series is
   required. The simplest way to derive such a time series is by computing
   the mean over the ensemble members at each point in time. This is what
   is used in, e.g., Fig. 4. Using the ensemble median instead results in
   only small differences compared to the mean. The choice of the method
   to aggregate the ensemble simulations into one time series has
   therefore a negligible impact on the power and wavelet spectra.

External forcings

   In the transient simulations, we prescribed the changes in Earth’s
   orbital parameters, a schematic temporal evolution of regolith mask,
   and a time-dependent rate of volcanic CO[2] outgassing as the only
   external drivers.

Orbital forcing

   Earth’s orbital parameters are well known for the past 3 Ma based on
   the astronomical solutions of (44).

Regolith cover scenarios

   The presence of regolith in our model has a dual effect on the ice
   sheets: (i) It enhances the velocity of ice sheet sliding over regions
   where the ice base is at its pressure melting point by a factor of 5,
   implying that basal velocity is five times higher for the same basal
   shear stress than for a sediment-free surface, roughly consistent with
   similar modeling approaches (22), and (ii) it increases the production
   of glaciogenic dust around the margins of the ice sheets, which affects
   surface albedo and facilitates surface melt (45). The present-day
   regolith mask was derived from the sediment thickness dataset of (20).
   Areas with sediment thickness larger than 100 m are assumed to be
   covered by regolith. The remaining areas, mainly large parts of North
   America and Scandinavia (fig. S3), are characterized by exposed
   crystalline bedrock. We assumed that the presently exposed bedrock
   areas are a result of glacial erosion by the Pleistocene ice flow
   associated with the waxing and waning of NH ice sheets and therefore
   considered all continents to be covered by regolith at 3 Ma ago, before
   the onset of NH glaciation. We then created 14 intermediate regolith
   masks by applying a two-dimensional backward diffusion process to the
   present-day regolith mask (fig. S3). Over Scandinavia, the applied
   diffusion coefficient is spatially uniform, while over North America,
   we started by diffusing the regolith mask northward from the southern
   margin of exposed bedrock until all continent is covered by regolith.
   In the resulting scenario, sediments were therefore first removed from
   the Arctic Archipelago, the area that we expect was the first to be
   affected by ice sheet growth at the onset of NH glaciation. Then,
   regolith was gradually removed in the area around the Hudson Bay and
   successively also further south and over Scandinavia. Some exposed
   bedrock is assumed to be present over Greenland at 3 Ma ago, but this
   assumption does not affect the results presented in the paper. With
   this procedure, we obtained the 16 regolith masks shown in fig. S3. By
   shifting these masks in time, we then created four scenarios that
   differ in the timing of regolith removal (Fig. 1B).

   The most recent reconstruction of pre-Quaternary geography (46)
   indicates that the elevation was similar to present (no notable uplift
   during the past 3 Ma), but Hudson Bay and Canadian Arctic Archipelago
   were absent. Indirect data also suggest that the Hudson Bay only
   developed during the late Quaternary. These differences in geography do
   have some, but not critically important, impact on glacial cycles.
   However, the temporal evolution of geography is unknown, and we decided
   to prescribe present-day geography and elevation.

Volcanic CO[2] outgassing scenarios

   To control the mean atmospheric concentration of CO[2] in the model, we
   used small changes in the prescribed volcanic CO[2] outgassing. The
   present-day volcanic outgassing used in the model is 5.3 Tmol C/year,
   which is the value that balances the weathering rate (26). The value of
   volcanic CO[2] outgassing for ~3 Ma ago has been derived from fitting
   modeling results to the benthic δ^18O stack. For that, we used an
   ensemble of transient model simulations initialized at 3.2 Ma ago and
   run for 500 ka driven by orbital variations, with continents fully
   covered by regolith and prescribed constant volcanic CO[2] outgassing
   ranging from 5.3 to 6.5 Tmol C/year. The different values of volcanic
   CO[2] outgassing lead to different modeled CO[2] concentrations. A best
   fit of modeled benthic δ^18O to the stack of (3) during interglacials
   is used to constrain the value of CO[2] outgassing to 6.2 Tmol C/year
   for the time interval between 3 and 2.7 Ma ago. Some recent studies
   suggest that Antarctica could have contributed up to 20 m of sea-level
   equivalent during the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene (47, 48). That
   would translate in a ~0.2‰ reduction in δ^18O, which, in turn, would
   lead to lower volcanic CO[2] outgassing values ~6.0 Tmol C/year to be
   more appropriate for the early Pleistocene. As a consequence, modeled
   atmospheric CO[2] concentration would also be lower by ~30 ppm. We then
   constructed four different scenarios for the temporal evolution of
   volcanic CO[2] outgassing between 3 Ma ago and the present day. All
   scenarios consist of a long-term decrease from 6.2 Tmol C/year at 3 Ma
   ago to 5.3 Tmol C/year at present, but the timing and rate of the
   decrease vary between scenarios (Fig. 1C). A decrease from 6.2 to 5.3
   Tmol C/year corresponds to a decrease of less than 20%. Because even
   the value for the present-day volcanic outgassing is known with an
   uncertainty of more than 100% (~3 to 10 Tmol C/year) (28), changes in
   volcanic outgassing represent a possible candidate to explain the
   long-term CO[2] decrease. However, the aim of our study is not to
   explain the causes of the CO[2] decrease, and other processes such as
   changes in weathering (7) or organic carbon burial in deep-sea
   sediments (29) would also be potential candidates to explain the
   long-term CO[2] decline.

Optimal scenarios

   Using the splitting in time technique described above, we then
   performed transient model simulations driven by orbital forcing and
   each of the 16 possible combinations of regolith removal and volcanic
   CO[2] outgassing scenarios. We then selected the scenarios that gave
   the best fit, in terms of root mean square error and correlation,
   between modeled and observed δ^18O (Fig. 1D). This is equivalent to
   solving an inverse problem to derive plausible scenarios for the poorly
   constrained long-term CO[2] decrease and timing of regolith removal.

Abstract

   The dwarf planet Ceres is known to host a considerable amount of water
   in its interior, and areas of water ice were detected by the Dawn
   spacecraft on its surface. Moreover, sporadic water and hydroxyl
   emissions have been observed from space telescopes. We report the
   detection of water ice in a mid-latitude crater and its unexpected
   variation with time. The Dawn spectrometer data show a change of water
   ice signatures over a period of 6 months, which is well modeled as
   ~2-km^2 increase of water ice. The observed increase, coupled with
   Ceres’ orbital parameters, points to an ongoing process that seems
   correlated with solar flux. The reported variation on Ceres’ surface
   indicates that this body is chemically and physically active at the
   present time.

INTRODUCTION

   Ceres contains significant amounts of water (1), which is a key element
   of its evolution (2), composition (3), and activity (2). Water ice has
   been estimated to be ubiquitous and abundant within a few meters from
   the surface (4). Exposed water ice was also discovered by the Dawn
   mission in a few craters on Ceres situated in the northern hemisphere
   above 42° latitude, indicating a strong dependence of water ice
   stability with the surface illumination condition and temperatures (5,
   6). A notable exception is represented by Juling crater (Fig. 1A),
   being situated in a mid-latitude, in the southern hemisphere (35°S,
   168°E), where the Dawn visible and infrared (VIR) mapping spectrometer
   (7) detected water ice owing to the diagnostic absorption bands at
   1.25, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 μm (Fig. 1B). VIR detected ice on the northern
   shadowed crater wall, characterized by an almost vertical rocky cliff,
   illuminated by a secondary light source coming from the adjacent
   illuminated regions. The crater floor shows evidence of the flow of ice
   and rock, similar to Earth’s rock glacier (fig. S1) (8).

   Fig. 1 General context of the ice-rich area in Juling crater from
   Framing Camera and VIR spectrometer data.

   (A) Context Dawn Framing Camera image taken during L1 acquisition of
   the northern rim of Juling crater. The area in shadow is enhanced to
   show details of the ice-rich wall. (B) Measured spectra corresponding
   to positions in (A). Dotted lines represent spectra in the ranges
   corresponding to instrument filter junctions that could produce
   fictitious signals. The diagnostic absorption bands of water ice at
   1.25, 1.5, and 2.0 μm are visible. The broad absorption band of water
   ice at 3.0 μm is superimposed to the narrower absorption bands at 2.7,
   3.1, and 3.4 μm, which indicates the presence of Mg phyllosilicates,
   NH[4] phyllosilicates, and Mg carbonates (3), respectively. These
   minerals are ubiquitous on Ceres’ surface (3).

   This crater has been observed by VIR several times: two times with a
   nominal spatial resolution of ~100 m per pixel during the Low Altitude
   Mapping Orbit (L1 and L2) and three times with a nominal spatial
   resolution of ~400 m per pixel during a phase devoted to Juling’s
   observation: Extended Juling Orbit (E1, E2, and E3).

RESULTS

   Analyzing all the acquisitions, we discovered changes in the spectra of
   the ice-rich wall. Water bands were detected in all the observations on
   the northern wall of Juling but with a variation of the water ice
   features, in particular, the 2.0-μm water ice absorption (Fig. 2) that
   is the most prominent band and least affected by instrumental errors.

   Fig. 2 Measured average spectra and their band area at 2.0 μm from the
   ice-rich region.

   (A) Average spectra for each of the five observations from pixels in
   the rectangle of coordinates: latitude = [−35.0643, −34.7051] and
   longitude = [167.8362, 169.1599]. Spectral ranges corresponding to the
   instrument filter junctions are not shown. (B) Absorption band at 2.0
   μm normalized at 1.83 μm. (C) Band area measured as a function of Earth
   days by setting the day of the first observation (L1) equal to 0.

   However, the rim and wall were observed under different conditions in
   terms of (i) illumination and viewing geometry (table S1) and (ii)
   sampling and resolution. Because these conditions might affect the
   spectral shape, we accounted for them as follows:

   1) We noticed that illumination and viewing geometry can be considered
   equal in E1 and L1 (table S1), thus permitting a direct comparison of
   the measured spectra (Fig. 3). All the other observations have been
   compared by means of dedicated modeling, as discussed afterward.

   Fig. 3 Comparison of L1 and E1 observations in the ice-rich area and in
   a test area.

   (A) Average spectra of pixels in the rectangle (latitude = [35.0643,
   −34.7051]; longitude = [167.8362, 169.1599]) are used as a reference to
   compare the five observations. Two measured spectra from L1 and E1 can
   be directly compared due to the equal viewing geometry and illumination
   conditions. (B) The increase of water ice signatures and continuum
   level is clearly visible. Error bars include Poissonian noise and
   calibration uncertainty. (C) Comparison of average spectra from a test
   area (latitude = [−35.714045, −35.292928]; longitude = [168.6245,
   169.8397]) does not show any significant variation.

   2) The different spatial resolution and different sampling of the
   surface by the observations (fig. S2) are taken into account
   calculating an average spectrum, obtained over several pixels in the
   target area (see the Supplementary Materials). The selected area is
   defined by a rectangle of coordinates in latitude = [−35.0643,
   −34.7051] and longitude = [167.8362, 169.1599] (Fig. 3). The rectangle
   was chosen to be larger than the area containing the ice-rich wall, to
   include all pixels showing water ice signatures, considering the
   extension of the instrument point spread function (fig. S3). The
   resulting average spectra are shown in Fig. 2A.

   The spectra shown in Fig. 2 are affected by different illumination
   conditions and viewing geometry, and they cannot be compared directly
   to infer intrinsic water ice variation. However, these conditions are
   very similar for L1 and E1 observations, allowing a direct comparison.
   The direct comparison between L1 and E1 shows significant differences,
   with more pronounced ice spectral signatures in E1 (Figs. 2 and 3). We
   verified this approach by comparing the spectra of a test area without
   ice signatures. In this case, no significant variation in the spectra
   can be detected, ruling out any bias due to the different spatial
   resolution and sampling as well as illumination conditions (Fig. 3).

   The selected ice-rich area (Fig. 3) includes both the signal coming
   from the wall, indirectly illuminated by the light reflected by the
   crater floor, and the signal coming from a region outside the crater
   rim, directly illuminated by the Sun. By modeling the average spectra
   as the sum of the two contributions (fig. S4), we estimate the spectrum
   of the ice-rich wall and its band area at 2.0 μm for all observations
   (L1, L2, E1, E2, and E3), as explained in the Supplementary Materials.
   Using this approach, we can compare all the observations. Figure 4A
   shows a clear increase of the derived 2.0-μm band area from ice-rich
   wall as a function of time.

   Fig. 4 Modeled increase of water ice on the crater wall and
   contextualization along Ceres’ orbit.

   (A) Left axis: Band area at 2.0 μm calculated after isolation of the
   signal of the ice-rich wall by removal of the outer signal from average
   spectrum. Right axis: Water ice abundance as retrieved by the model
   (table S2). Both quantities are shown as a function of Earth days by
   setting the day of the first observation (L1) equal to 0. Error bars
   are estimated as discussed in the Supplementary Materials. au,
   astronomical unit. (B) Ceres orbit with International Ultraviolet
   Explorer (IUE) and Herschel water detections (12, 13). The orbit
   segment associated with the Juling observations indicates an increasing
   solar flux in the southern hemisphere of Ceres, where Juling is
   located.

   Intrinsic variations of the band area can be attributed to changing
   abundances of water ice, as well as other physical properties, such as
   changes in grain size. Using the model described in Materials and
   Methods, the spectra can be modeled by an areal mixture of regolith and
   water ice, and the observed variation of spectral signatures can be
   explained by an increasing abundance of water ice as a function of
   time, with an effective grain diameter fixed to 100 μm (see fig. S5).
   Best fits of the spectra are shown in fig. S6. As a further check,
   considering the information on the illumination condition and viewing
   geometry, we simulated the spectra of all observations assuming a
   constant ice abundance. The simulations show that a constant quantity
   of water ice is incompatible with the observations (fig. S7).

   According to the modeled spectra, the total area of the ice-rich wall
   results to be covered by 9.1 ± 0.3% of water ice in the first
   observation and by 13.7 ± 0.9% of water ice in the last observation
   (Fig. 4A and table S2). Using shape model analysis, we estimated the
   total surface of the wall to be ~40 km^2, from which we obtain an
   increase from 3.6 to 5.5 km^2 (±0.4 km^2) of the surface covered by
   water ice.

DISCUSSION

   The observed increasing abundance of water ice on the crater wall
   implies a change in temperature/pressure induced by (i) internal
   processes, (ii) exposure of ice present behind a regolith layer by
   falls, or (iii) solar input.

   i) One possible internal process would involve subsurface displacement
   of brine or liquid water, which, percolating through clay layers,
   freezes when exposed to the shadowed cold surface of the wall. The flow
   features on the crater floor would favor this hypothesis, but this
   scenario is difficult to reconcile with current evolution models of
   Ceres’ interior (2). Water in liquid or brine forms would imply either
   higher internal temperatures with respect to those foreseen for Ceres
   or much lower melting point (9). Nevertheless, subsurface brines have
   been suggested to explain the morphology and composition of the Occator
   central dome (9), and cryovolcanism has been indicated as the source of
   Ahuna Mons (10). Moreover, Ceres topography suggests the presence of
   liquid pore fluids in the uppermost mantle (11).

   ii) Another possibility is represented by falls exposing water ice. The
   monotonic trend (Fig. 4A) is not consistent with an exceptional event,
   such as a rock fall exposing water ice. However, a continuous erosion
   of the wall by regolith falls is possible, and it can justify the
   formation of the rock glaciers. In that case, the increase of ice on
   the wall can be explained by the exposure of pristine water ice, which
   does not sublimate with the same rate of its exposure during the season
   of the observations.

   iii) Other mechanisms would involve water vapor, which has been
   observed by Küppers et al. (12) and A’Hearn and Feldman (13). Water
   vapor might originate from the rock glaciers on the crater floor below
   a regolith layer, and the shadowed wall of the crater may be a cold
   trap for the water molecules. As long as the accumulation rate of water
   molecules is higher than the sublimation rate from the wall itself, the
   ice on the wall increases. Considering the derived 1.9-km^2 (±0.4 km^2)
   increase of ice cross section and assuming a grain diameter of 100 μm,
   we obtain an increase of the volume of water ice of 125 ± 25 m^3 in 6
   months. The equivalent average accumulation rate (net of sublimation)
   is 8.0 ± 1.6 g/s ( Embedded Image Embedded Image = 1 g/cm^3).

   It has been suggested that the observed water vapor (12) was triggered
   by solar radiation (12) and/or solar energetic particle events (14).
   The changes in heliocentric distance (Fig. 4 and table S1), coupled
   with the varying season (the subsolar point was moving toward lower
   latitudes), result in a net increase in solar flux and a retreat of
   shadow on the floor (fig. S8). We used a thermophysical model to
   simulate the water flux coming from the crater floor, triggered by
   solar radiation, at the epoch of Herschel observations (15, 16).
   Assuming that the crater floor is filled by water ice at ~1 cm below
   the surface, the estimated vapor flux coming from the crater is
   comparable to the total flux derived from Herschel observations (fig.
   S9). Moreover, Juling is located in proximity of the longitudinal
   coordinate, where the maximum emission was observed by Küppers et al.
   (12). However, we do not have constraints to derive the extension of
   the ice layer and the thickness of the superficial regolith layer.
   Thus, if water ice is confined below the thermal skin depth, then the
   solar radiation would not be sufficient to sublimate enough water
   vapor.

   Solar energetic protons have been indicated as possible sources of
   water vapor (14) because they could reach ice present in deeper
   subsurficial layers. Although these also might affect the surface ice
   at Juling, the event observed by Dawn (14) lasted about a day and the
   ensuing exosphere remained for a week. Hence, any lost water from
   Juling’s cold shadowed walls could be replenished.

   The linear relationship between ice abundance and solar flux (fig. S8)
   supports the possibility of solar flux as the main factor responsible
   for the observed increase. The water ice abundance on the wall is
   probably not constantly increasing over a longer time range. More
   likely, we are observing only part of a seasonal cycle of water
   sublimation and condensation, in which the observed increase should be
   followed by a decrease. Similar cycles of water ice have been observed
   for comet 67P/C-G (17–20) related to changes in heat flux.

   The orbital parameters of Ceres could justify such a cyclical trend
   (see Fig. 4B). After the period covered by the observations, Ceres
   approaches the summer solstice, close to perihelion, where the
   temperature of the shadowed area increases, possibly triggering also
   the sublimation of water ice previously accumulated on the cold wall or
   sublimating pristine water ice with higher rate than its exposure.

   The variation of superficial water ice occurring in the short time
   frame covered by these observations provides new scenarios for Ceres’
   evolution. It indicates an active body and reinforces not only the link
   with the icy solar system objects (3) but also the uniqueness of Ceres,
   given its present location in the main belt.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Non-intrinsic sources of spectral variability among different observations

   To correctly compare the average spectra measured for the five
   observations of the ice-rich wall of Juling crater, we should take into
   account the non-intrinsic sources of spectral variability due to
   different conditions of observation:

   1) Poissonian noise, which produces spurious spectral variability among
   different measured spectra. This noise is less significant for average
   spectra obtained by a large number of measurements. It minimizes the
   noise for the average spectra analyzed in the present work because the
   average spectra are derived from tens or hundreds of pixels (table S1).

   2) Different spatial resolutions among the five observations analyzed
   in this work may introduce a bias when the spectra are compared: in
   particular, the higher the resolution, the more sensitive would be the
   measurement of the finest detail, which could not be resolved in
   lower-resolution observations. To address this issue, we only compared
   average spectra coming from the whole area of interest, covered by tens
   or hundreds of pixels, which is spatially resolved for all
   observations.

   3) Although the area of interest is covered by these observations, the
   footprints of the spectrometer slit are not contiguous (fig. S2); thus,
   each point on the surface can be sampled in differing degrees of detail
   by the instrument, according to the position of the closest pixel
   footprint. This sampling heterogeneity introduces a further source of
   uncertainty. However, ~50% of the area of interest is covered by
   considering the pixel footprint only (fig. S2), and nearly 100% by
   considering the spatial extension of the point spread function of the
   instrument (fig. S3). Thus, the measured average signal should be
   representative, within the margin of error, of the whole area of
   interest, regardless of the extent of sampling of a particular area.
   This is confirmed by the same average signal of the test area shown in
   Fig. 3.

   To evaluate the above-mentioned uncertainties, we simulated different
   spatial samplings and assessed the induced variability of the derived
   parameters. We used the following approaches: (i) random weights in the
   0 to 2 range have been assigned to all pixels in the area of interest;
   (ii) a weighted average spectrum is calculated from the pixels with
   their assigned weights; (iii) the targeted spectral parameter is
   calculated from the average spectrum; (iv) the previous three points
   are repeated many times, starting from different random weights and
   thus obtaining a distribution of values of the targeted parameter; and
   (v) the error associated for each derived parameter is the SD of the
   corresponding distribution. The error bars of Figs. 2C and 4A are
   calculated in this way.Using this approach, we assigned a relative
   uncertainty of 100% for each pixel, simulating all the intermediate
   possibilities between the case in which a pixel is not detected and the
   case in which it is detected twice. This uncertainty propagates an
   error on the spectral parameter derived from the average spectrum,
   which is estimated by the approach discussed here.

   4) In each observation, the total surface of the ice-rich wall can have
   a different projection of the corresponding area along the line of
   sight, according to the spacecraft position at the moment of
   observation. A different contribution between the area of the ice-rich
   wall and the area of outer regions (devoid of water ice), in the
   resulting average spectra, produces a fictitious variation of the
   spectral features. As an example of this effect, we observed an
   apparent smaller band area at 2.0 μm in L2, with respect to L1. To
   account for this issue, and to derive intrinsic spectral parameters of
   water ice in the ice-rich wall, a dedicated model has been implemented,
   as discussed in the “Spectral modeling” section.

Band area

   The band area at 2.0 μm, reported in Figs. 2C and 4A, fig. S7, and
   table S2, is defined as Embedded Image Embedded Image where a and b are
   the edges of the bands: 1.83 to 2.24 μm. The continuum used to
   characterize the bands is calculated with a linear fit between a and b.
   The band area as defined above is expressed in micrometers. Error bars
   are estimated as discussed above.

Spectral modeling

   The measured signal inside the region of interest defined in the main
   text is the sum of the radiance coming from the illuminated outer
   region (without ice) (OR) (Eq. 1) and the one coming from the ice-rich
   wall (IRW) in shadow, but illuminated by the light reflected by the
   crater itself (Eq. 2). The nearly vertical wall in shadow is
   illuminated from all directions within the solid angle subtended by the
   crater as seen by the wall (~π steradians). To model the light
   scattered from the crater floor toward the shadowed wall, and the
   secondary scattered light from the latter toward the detector, we take
   into account the bi-hemispherical reflectance (21). Higher orders of
   scattering are assumed to be negligible.

   The regolith of the ice-rich wall (Eq. 2) is modeled by an aerial
   mixture of water ice (WI) [optical constants by Warren (22), Mastrapa
   et al. (23), and Clark et al. (24)] and Ceres’ average terrain (CAT)
   with optical properties as defined by Ciarniello et al. (25).

   Using spectral modeling, we derived grain size of water ice of the
   order of 100 μm for all observations. This value is thus kept fixed in
   the fitting procedure discussed here. Embedded Image Embedded Image
   (1)where Rad[OR] is the radiance of the outer regions; J is the solar
   irradiance; r[R_OR] is the bidirectional reflectance (21) of Ceres’
   average terrain, with photometric parameters as defined by Ciarniello
   et al. (25), and viewing geometry by shape model analysis and
   spacecraft position at the moment of the observations (table S1); and f
   = (1 + b*(λ − λ[0]) + c*(λ − λ[0])^4) is the correction factor for the
   continuum slope, with b and c being constants derived in the fitting
   procedure, and λ[0] = 3.0 μm. This term accounts for the variation of
   the continuum slope due to spurious instrumental effects in
   correspondence with spatial signal contrast, such as shadowed regions.
   A similar approach is discussed by Ciarniello et al. (19). The models
   performed with and without this correction factor are shown in fig. S4.
   Embedded Image Embedded Image (2)where Rad[IRW] is the radiance of the
   ice-rich wall; r[s_CAT] is the bi-hemispherical reflectance (21) of
   Ceres’ average terrain; <μ[0]> is the average incidence angle cosine on
   the crater at the time of the observation, derived by shape model
   analysis; (r[s_CAT] <μ[0]>/π) represents the reflectance of a
   Lambertian surface, with Lambert albedo equal to r[s_CAT] (20); the
   factor 2 in the denominator accounts for the fact that one-half of the
   whole solid angle seen by the ice-rich wall is covered by the crater
   itself; r[s_WI] is the bi-hemispherical reflectance (21) of water ice;
   and p[WI] is the cross section of water ice as a fraction of the total
   projected area of the ice-rich wall (in the main text, we refer to this
   quantity as water ice abundance) Embedded Image Embedded Image (3)where
   Refl[average] is the average reflectance; p[IRW] is the cross section
   of the ice-rich wall as a fraction of the total projected area of
   interest; and p[OR] = (1 − p[IRW]) is the cross section of the outer
   regions as a fraction of the total projected area of interest.

   Using a least-square optimization algorithm, we performed a model of
   Refl[average] (Eq. 3) by fitting the measured reflectance, similar to
   that of Raponi et al. (20). Photometric correction of measured data is
   not required, because photometric parameters are included in the model
   as specified above.

   As a result, we retrieved p[IRW] and p[WI] unambiguously. Spectral
   modeling was performed in the 1.15- to 3.55-μm interval to avoid the
   spectral range affected by thermal emission. Models are shown in fig.
   S5.

Abstract

   Declining deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon are touted as a
   conservation success, but illegal logging is a problem of similar
   scale. Recent regulatory efforts have improved detection of some forms
   of illegal logging but are vulnerable to more subtle methods that mask
   the origin of illegal timber. We analyzed discrepancies between
   estimated timber volumes of the national forest inventory of Brazil and
   volumes of logging permits as an indicator of potential fraud in the
   timber industry in the eastern Amazon. We found a strong overestimation
   bias of high-value timber species volumes in logging permits. Field
   assessments confirmed fraud for the most valuable species and
   complementary strategies to generate a “surplus” of licensed timber
   that can be used to legalize the timber coming from illegal logging. We
   advocate for changes to the logging control system to prevent
   overexploitation of Amazonian timber species and the widespread forest
   degradation associated with illegal logging.

INTRODUCTION

   Tropical forests have been one of the main foci of the international
   environmental movement because of their importance in regulating
   climate and protecting biodiversity and because of the high rates of
   deforestation and degradation observed in recent decades (1, 2). The
   Brazilian Amazon—the largest tropical forest worldwide—has become a
   global model for developing solutions to safeguard tropical forests (3)
   through creation of large protected areas (4), enforcement of
   environmental legislation (5), interventions in the soy and cattle
   supply chains (6), use of advanced technologies to monitoring
   deforestation by PRODES (Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project) (7),
   and establishment of large logging concessions on public lands
   threatened by forest encroachment (8). Together, these strategies have
   worked to reduce deforestation rates by 76% from 2004 to 2017 (9).
   Illegal logging affects as much area as deforestation in the Brazilian
   Amazon (10, 11) and is another major threat to biodiversity
   conservation in the region, as well as a catalyst for further
   degradation (12, 13). The effectiveness of policy interventions to
   prevent illegal logging in the Amazon, however, is less known and
   difficult to measure. Remote sensing technologies have been developed
   to identify areas of illegal logging (14) and some obvious
   irregularities in authorized management plans (15), but no alternative
   is available for large-scale assessments of more subtle noncompliance
   with logging permits, such as deliberate overestimation of high-value
   timber species inventories.

   Illegal logging is a huge barrier for using timber markets to promote
   sustainable use and conservation of forests. Forty-four percent (46,149
   ha) of all tropical timber harvested between 2015 and 2016 in Pará—the
   largest timber production state in the Brazilian Amazon—was illegal
   (15). In an attempt to minimize illegal logging, the Brazilian
   government established a public forest concession system in 2006, which
   created opportunities for private entrepreneurs and communities to
   harvest timber on 23,844 km^2 of public forest land (16). On private
   landholdings, timber harvesting is regulated by specific legislation
   and by IBAMA (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos
   Naturais Renováveis), the federal environmental agency. For mechanized
   logging, permits have to respect a maximum of 30 m^3 ha^−1 timber yield
   in harvesting cycles of 25 to 35 years and a minimum felling diameter
   at breast height (DBH) of 50 cm (except when a specific DBH is assigned
   for a given species) and to retain commercial-size seed trees (at least
   10% of large trees with commercial DBH in the area or three trees per
   100 ha, whichever rule is more restrictive) (17). Legal timber
   harvesting, transportation, processing, and trading are tracked through
   the Document of Forest Origin (that is, paperwork formally required in
   each of these steps), which should, in theory, prevent fraud.
   Operationalizing this control system, however, has been problematic.
   The Pará state environmental agency has 55 forest officers to analyze,
   audit, and approve forest management applications in the
   1.24-million-km^2 state (almost the size of Peru). The mismatch between
   the current staffing and the area of forest being logged prevents field
   checking of logging permits—an invitation for fraud and corruption.
   Remote monitoring and case studies suggest that various forms of fraud
   contribute to the continued prevalence of illegal logging (15, 18). We
   investigated the potential role of one such form of fraud (that is,
   deliberate overestimation of high-value timber populations) in
   facilitating extraction and sale of illegal timber.

   We evaluated evidence of fraud in the timber industry in the Brazilian
   Amazon based on the discrepancy between the estimated timber volumes in
   plots established by the government in undisturbed forests and the
   volumes of approved logging permits, as well as field assessments of
   six logged areas. We focused our analysis on Pará, eastern Amazon—the
   main timber production and export state. First, we integrated data of
   427 valid logging permits issued from 2012 to 2017 in Pará, with 426
   1-ha plots surveyed through the national forest inventory of Brazil
   (hereafter referred to as RADAM plots) (19) distributed across Pará
   state (fig. S1). From a total of 80 potential species, we selected 11
   species or species groups (2 or 3 species sold with the same commercial
   name) with at least 50 observations in both logging permits and RADAM
   plots for comparison. These species represented a range of wood values
   and accounted for a total of 2.8 million m^3 of timber, 482,682 trees,
   and more than US$52 million of licensed timber (table S1). Discrepancy
   analyses were complemented by post-logging field assessments of six
   logging permits in western Pará accounting for a forest management area
   of 671,954 ha, in which the timber volume of ipê species (Handroanthus
   spp.) intended to be harvested in forest management area was much
   higher (>4 m^3 ha^−1) than those observed in RADAM plots (0.7 m^3
   ha^−1).

RESULTS

   The discrepancy between timber volumes registered in forest management
   units of approved logging permits and those observed in RADAM plots was
   positively correlated with timber price of standing trees, indicating a
   strong bias of potential overestimation of the most valuable timber
   species in logging permits (Fig. 1A). This pattern persisted when a
   more conservative analytical approach was used to compare timber
   volumes of low-, medium-, and high-value species of logging permits to
   quantile classes near the density distribution limit of those species’
   timber volumes in RADAM plots; we found that high-value species volumes
   exceeded the 90th percentile Amazon-wide inventory values in a larger
   proportion of logging permits than did volumes for less desirable
   timber species (Fig. 1B). Overall, the logging permits with potential
   overestimated timber volumes were spatially independent, which
   conflicts with the interpretation that higher timber volumes in logging
   permits are associated with specific regions where commercial timber
   species are more abundant (Fig. 2).

   The discrepancy between timber volumes registered to be harvested in
   forest management units of approved logging permits and those observed
   in RADAM plots (that is, plots surveyed through the national forest
   inventory of Brazil) was positively correlated with timber price of
   standing trees (A), as was the proportion of logging permits with
   timber volumes located in the quantile classes of >90% (all colors
   except blue) of the density distribution of timber volumes of RADAM
   plots (B). Vertical error bars in (A) represent the SD.

   Fig. 2 Spatial distribution of logging permits according to their level
   of discrepancy in relation to RADAM plots.

   Distribution in the state of Pará of logging permits with timber
   volumes located in the quantile classes of >90% (all colors except
   blue) of the density distribution of timber volumes of RADAM plots
   (that is, plots surveyed through the national forest inventory of
   Brazil) of different Amazonian timber species. The top part of the
   figure shows the distribution of Handroanthus spp. Maps for other
   species are ordered from low- to high-value species from top left to
   bottom right in the layout.

   A minority of professionals were in charge of logging permits with
   higher probability of fraud (for example, with timber volume ratio in
   logging permits versus RADAM plots > 2), except for the most valuable
   species (Handroanthus spp.), for which most foresters registered much
   higher timber volumes in forest management units than those reported by
   RADAM plots (Fig. 3A). Four of the five species with the highest wood
   prices concentrated the most discrepant values (Fig. 3A), and the
   amount of variation among foresters increased with timber price (Fig.
   3B). These results indicate that the general pattern of overestimated
   timber volumes in logging permits is strongly influenced by timber
   price and that a relatively small subset of professional foresters is
   associated with the most egregious overestimations.

   Fig. 3 Distribution of potentially fraudulent logging permits and
   overestimation variation among foresters.

   Distribution of the average ratio of timber volume in logging permits
   to RADAM plots (that is, plots surveyed through the national forest
   inventory of Brazil) of each forester in charge of logging permit,
   ordered from lowest to highest ratio for each species group on the x
   axis (A), and positive correlation between the SD of the ratios
   associated with different foresters and timber price of standing trees
   (B).

   Only 61% of the 152 trees identified as ipê species (Handroanthus spp.)
   in logging permits were confirmed during field checking of logged
   forests. The average proportion of botanical identification “mistakes”
   across the six areas was 42%, varying from no error in one site to
   93.3% error in another. We found 13 commercial species “erroneously”
   identified as ipê, with low-value tanimbuca (Terminalia sp.), jarana
   (Lecythis lurida), and timborana (Anadenanthera sp.) being the most
   frequent (72.4% of the individuals); 85 ± 10% of the non-ipê trees were
   of species not included in the logging permit of the forest (that is,
   not considered valuable enough to harvest), which means that their
   harvesting was not anticipated or controlled and that the extra ipê
   volume garnered through “misidentification” could be easily used to
   mask illegal ipês. Ipê species are quite easy to identify and clearly
   distinguish morphologically (compound, palmate leaves) from the three
   species most frequently identified as ipê (simple leaves in jarana and
   tanimbuca and twice pinnate leaves in timborana), so misidentification
   can be attributed to fraud. In addition, we found that the diameter of
   real ipê trees was frequently overestimated. Overall, the stump
   diameters of 130 logged trees assessed in field checking were 31%
   smaller than the DBH claimed in logging permits, despite the fact that
   diameter measurements at stump height will almost always overestimate
   DBH. Naming other species as ipê and inflating tree diameter can be
   complementary strategies to generate a “surplus” of licensed ipê timber
   in logging permits to legalize the timber coming from illegal logging.
   Inventing trees, duplicating tree numbers, exceeding allowed harvest
   rates, and felling trees in forbidden zones (for example, reserve
   areas) were also observed, although less frequent. In all of the
   management areas investigated, we found evidence that the ipê timber
   volume reported on the Document of Forest Origin could not have been
   produced from that area alone while following harvest regulations.

DISCUSSION

   The discrepancies between timber volumes from logging permits and RADAM
   plots may be associated with deliberate inflation of values to obtain
   the Document of Forest Origin to legalize timber extracted above
   authorized volumes, without maintaining the legal minimum number of
   seed trees, and in areas where timber exploitation is not permitted.
   Ipê was by far the species with the strongest signal of potential fraud
   in logging permits. It is the internationally preferred timber for
   decking and one of the most expensive species in the market (20), with
   prices as high as those achieved historically by big-leaf mahogany
   (Swietenia macrophylla King) before commercial exploitation was
   prohibited in Brazil in 2001 to avoid the species’ extinction. We found
   evidence that ipê is the “new big-leaf mahogany” and that overlogging
   may lead this species to extinction (21). This species is one of the
   most vulnerable to logging in Amazonian forests because of its natural
   low density and low growth rates (21). A total of 33,389 m^3 was
   licensed to be logged in 2017, and 74.2% of this volume has a high risk
   of being overestimated (that is, located in logging permits included in
   the quantile >95% of the density distribution of timber volumes; Fig.
   2). This suggests that the issues observed in our field assessments are
   likely to be widespread.

   Given the high probability of fraud in logging permits, we advocate
   supply chain interventions, following the examples of the soy and beef
   moratoriums implemented in the same region a few years ago (6). The
   timber moratorium would create the chance for the Brazilian
   Environmental Agency to revisit logging permits and check
   inconsistencies in the field, using the analytical framework presented
   here or another approach developed for this task. Field checking of
   logging plans is an essential component for preventing fraud. For
   instance, post-logging field inspections of forest concessions in the
   Peruvian Amazon resulted in the cancellation of almost half of
   inspected concessions due to major violations of existing norms (22).
   We are aware that a moratorium could cause economic setbacks to the
   Brazilian timber industry, which accounted for 85% of all neotropical
   production of roundlogs (13) and a total export value of US$600 million
   in 2016 (23). However, Brazilian law does not allow timber trading that
   comes at the expense of overexploitation and potential extinction of
   native trees. It is already known that current logging regulations
   applied to forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon are not expected
   to safeguard the long-term conservation of timber species, given that
   most targeted species are rare and slow-growing (13). However, the
   apparent substantial overestimation of timber volumes in logging
   licenses could represent the “kiss of death” for species like ipê.

   Frauds during timber harvesting licensing can occur as a result of
   negligence and corruption in several ways: (i) through the approval of
   logging activities in areas already exploited or deforested, (ii)
   issuing credits (that is, license to harvest timber) regardless of the
   authorized amount requested (even when impossibly large), (iii)
   registering fake tree inventories in the system to issue credits for
   timber companies that do not exist or do not have a forest to harvest
   legally, (iv) by obtaining credit for areas where there is no intention
   to log, and (v) overestimating the volume or density of valuable
   species (24). The illegal credits can be used to harvest, transport,
   and sell timber from unauthorized or prohibited logging areas. For
   example, around 90% of the illegally harvested area between 2008 and
   2012 in Pará state was conducted in indigenous lands and protected
   areas (25). Fraudulent logging operations are generally detected in
   isolated operations of regulatory agencies, covering a small fraction
   of the forest area logged annually, and always after timber
   exploitation. The large-scale detection of frauds before timber
   harvesting and identification of foresters involved in these frauds, as
   allowed by the methodological approach used in this work and the
   web-based system proposed here, would be a strategic advance for
   imposing critical barriers to continuation of illegal logging in the
   Brazilian Amazon (Fig. 4).

   The economic viability of sustainable timber management in the Amazon
   may rely on improving the public systems governing logging in native
   forests. The major competitor of legal logging is illegal logging,
   which pushes market timber prices down and undermines the necessary
   investments for reduced impact logging and enforcement of no-go zones.
   Although the timber moratorium could bring some relief to overexploited
   timber species, it will not solve the problem of the weak system used
   to control timber exploitation in the Amazon. Timber buyers should not
   rely solely on governments to reduce illegal logging. The timber market
   and other sectors of society should exert more pressure on governments
   to make the licensing processes fully transparent. The same is true for
   the existing chain of custody monitoring systems [for example, SINAFLOR
   (National System for the Control of the Origin of Forest Products) and
   SISFLORA (System for Marketing and Transporting of Forest Products) in
   Brazil] that are under the responsibility of state and federal
   environmental agencies. The Brazilian Federal Council of Engineering
   and Agronomy, which controls the activity of foresters, has the mandate
   to punish professionals involved in fraud and should make use of it.
   Certification schemes and emerging platforms to control timber origin
   (26) can also be part of the solution. On the other hand, a new control
   system is required and would be relatively easy to implement. The main
   problems currently observed in the present system—lack of consistency
   and standardization in species names, near-automatic approval of
   logging without previous field checking, and lack of integration among
   available databases on timber stocks and species distributions—could be
   partially resolved by creating a new web-based system to manage
   information (Fig. 4) and targeted field supervision of logging permits.

   Fig. 4 Proposed web-based system to register and manage logging
   permits.

   This system would require the documentation of species based on
   predefined, standardized botanical or commercial names, their
   associated timber volumes, and geospatial information on their
   localization in licensed forests, which would be integrated in the
   system with existing databases to assess the levels of discrepancies of
   informed and expected timber volumes in forest management units of
   logging permits. Field checking of logging permits would be guided by
   this analysis to optimize the use of a limited staff to control large
   areas of forest concessions.

   Scientific methods for timber identification and timber tracking have
   been developed to verify timber legality. These methods have mostly
   used visual identification (wood anatomy and dendrochronology),
   chemical approaches (mass spectrometry, near-infrared spectroscopy,
   stable isotopes, and radiocarbon dating), and genetic approaches (DNA
   barcoding, population genetics/phylogeography, and DNA fingerprint)
   (27). DNA technologies have been tested in several countries to combat
   illegal logging (28). In Indonesia, the integration of mandatory forest
   certification with the national system of legality of wood [SVLK
   (Sistem Verifikasi Legalitas Kayu)] has increased international
   credibility on the timber exploitation control system, since an
   independent auditor evaluates whether harvests are in accordance with
   the laws of the country (29). Other countries have their own systems
   for monitoring tropical timber chain of custody, and most of the
   successful cases involve field checking and stump inspection. The
   timber transportation control is usually made using travel permits.
   Thailand has checkpoints all over the country, some of which are open
   24 hours a day. Suriname has developed a computerized log-tracking
   system called LogPro to monitor all information about harvest
   operations, payment of forest fees, and forest planning (30). Producers
   are required by law to provide detailed information concerning the
   production, which is registered twice in the system by two independent
   data processors. The system crosses information and checks
   incompatibilities, thus reducing the possibility of corruption.

   Conserving Amazonian timber species requires a new model that includes
   enforcement and modernization of logging licenses, as well as
   meaningful engagement of all stakeholder groups. Conversion of
   paperwork to digital platforms would not only reduce the numerous
   problems caused by bureaucracy and the opportunities for corruption, it
   could also increase transparency and allow a better integration of
   existing databases to guide decision-making. In this context,
   scientists could partner with governments to develop effective
   solutions to environmental problems and reduce the gap between
   knowledge generation and application. Without a serious effort to
   address this issue, large-scale high-grading and degradation of
   Amazonian forests will continue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Logging permits and official forest inventories

   We gathered a total of 427 valid logging permits [AUTEF (Autorização de
   Exploração Florestal)] issued from 2012 to 2017 and available at the
   Integrated System for Monitoring and Environmental License [SIMLAM
   (Sistema Integrado de Monitoramento e Licenciamento Ambiental)] of the
   Environmental Secretariat of Pará. Logging permits classified as
   “canceled” or “suspended” were not considered. Each logging permit
   consisted of the list of species and respective timber volumes to be
   logged in the area licensed for timber exploitation (mean area of
   logging permits, 561 ha; range, 18 to 4552 ha) (fig. S1). The
   information presented in logging permits was obtained by the
   application of the legal norms on timber exploitation in native
   Amazonian forests (17) to a census of the area licensed for timber
   exploitation. We contrasted the timber volumes registered for harvest
   in forest management units of logging permits with those obtained by
   426 spatially independent, 1-ha RADAM plots (DBH, ≥50 cm; fig. S1).
   These RADAM plots were not randomly distributed in Pará state because
   of the inaccessibility of the vast majority of areas of the dense
   Amazon forest. However, the RADAM protocols attempted to collect
   representative samples of the major vegetation types in each region and
   avoided sampling disturbed forests by largely sampling in areas
   accessible only by helicopter, as far as possible from roads and trails
   (19). Although larger inventory plots would be preferred to compare
   with logging areas, the RADAM inventory is still the best source of
   information available for wide-scale assessments of timber stocks,
   aboveground biomass, and tree species distribution in the Brazilian
   Amazon and has been used in many studies (13, 21, 31, 32).

Timber species

   The taxonomic identification of timber species in the Amazon is
   problematic, and a mix of different scientific and common names is used
   for a single group of commercial timber species. A total of 80 timber
   “species” were found in logging permits, from which we selected 11
   species or species groups (two or three species sold with the same
   commercial name) for which we had at least 50 observations in both
   logging permits and RADAM plots (table S1). Timber prices of standing
   trees were obtained from (33), and monetary conversion was considered
   US$1 = R$3.15.

Field assessments

   To validate the analytical approach used to identify potential
   overestimated timber volumes in logging permits, we performed field
   assessments of ipê (Handroanthus spp.)—the commercial species with the
   highest timber price and for which we found the highest likelihood of
   fraud—in logged forests. We first selected recent logging permits
   (issued from August 2016 onward) in western Pará, totaling ~100 logging
   permits. Then, we selected the 19 logging permits that presented >4 m^3
   ipê timber per hectare, which also showed high discrepancy between
   estimated timber volumes of RADAM plots and the volumes of approved
   logging permits, and with volumes in the quantile classes of >95% of
   the density distribution of timber volumes. Finally, we selected six
   areas in accordance with the staff of IBAMA of the Ministry of
   Environment, which gave preference to small (~100 ha) areas planned to
   be harvested within just 1 or 2 years. These six areas represent small
   logging areas with a single annual production unit [Unidade de Produção
   Anual (UPA)], which comprise the majority of logging permits issued in
   Pará state. By the time field assessments are carried out, these areas
   had already been logged. Using the available documentation (forest
   surveys and maps) for each area, we randomly sampled the ipê trees
   listed in each area, which included both harvested and remnant trees.
   Standing trees were identified by observing vegetative materials, and
   the stumps were identified by observing external and internal bark
   traits and botanical attributes of shoots; when necessary, a piece of
   heartwood was collected with a chainsaw to examine its macroscopic
   anatomy. We measured the DBH of standing trees, and for logged trees,
   we calculated the mean diameter of each stump based on two
   perpendicular diameter measurements. Measurements of stump diameters
   were obtained at a height of ~45 cm, where the diameter is expected to
   be larger than that of the DBH. Therefore, our analysis was
   conservative, and higher diameter discrepancies would be expected if we
   had been able to measure actual DBH before harvest.

Statistical analysis

   We calculated the average ratio between the timber volume of each
   species in logging permits and the mean timber volume of the same
   species in all plots of RADAM inventory as a strategy to identify
   discrepancies between them and use it as a proxy to detect potential
   fraud (that is, inflated timber volumes in logging permits). We are
   aware that some discrepancies are to be expected when comparing timber
   volumes estimated from small official plots distributed over a wide
   geographical area with those from inventories of large logging areas.
   However, we did not focus the interpretation of results on the absolute
   values of these discrepancies but rather on the “direction” and
   consistency (if timber volumes were generally underrepresented or
   overrepresented) and on the bias toward overestimating the most
   valuable species. Given that the timber volume estimates of logging
   permits are expected to omit some commercial-size trees of each species
   to satisfy the legal criteria of keeping at least 10% of large trees in
   the area or three trees per 100 ha (or 15% of large trees and four
   trees per 100 ha for species included in the official lists of
   threatened species for which timber harvesting is allowed) and that the
   RADAM inventory did not use any exclusion criteria, our analysis can be
   considered conservative with respect to overestimation detection. We
   then performed a Pearson correlation between the average ratio of
   logging permits to RADAM plots and timber prices. We also investigated
   the discrepancies between timber volumes of logging permits and RADAM
   plots using a different analytical approach based on the density
   distribution of simulated larger RADAM plots and logging permits. Since
   the official inventory of RADAM was based on smaller inventory plots (1
   ha) than those used by the forest inventories associated with logging
   permits (18 to 4552 ha), we performed 10,000 randomizations of 19 1-ha
   plots (an area similar to the smallest logging permit inventory and one
   that makes a better histogram of timber volumes per species). We then
   generated histograms of official inventory/logging permit density
   distribution; assessed the proportion of logging permits with timber
   volumes included in the quantiles 90%, 90 to 95%, 95 to 99%, and >99%
   of the histogram of simulated RADAM plots with a larger (19 ha) area;
   and plotted the results in the map of Pará state to visualize their
   spatial distribution (see the example of Handroanthus spp. in Fig. 2).

   Furthermore, we obtained the identification of the forester in charge
   of each logging permit (97 professionals) and selected those with at
   least three licenses for one of the selected species. According to
   Brazilian regulations, forest management plans must have a forester in
   charge of the technical responsibility of operations. Then, we ranked
   the logging permits/RADAM plots ratio with the number of foresters as a
   means to evaluate the proportion of foresters in charge of logging
   permits with higher chances of fraud.

Abstract

   The development of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) is considered the
   biggest change to the global energy production system in the last
   half-century. However, several communities have banned fracking because
   of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human
   health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we
   analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from
   2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different
   distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and
   after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed
   maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were
   and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for
   negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3
   km of a mother’s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in
   utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts
   include a greater incidence of low–birth weight babies as well as
   significant declines in average birth weight and in several other
   measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects
   at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking
   are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the
   nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active
   fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of
   poor birth outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

   The growth in unconventional gas production involving hydraulic
   fracturing (“fracking”) has transformed the energy landscape, reducing
   energy prices, decreasing conventional air pollution by displacing coal
   in electricity generation, disrupting international energy trading
   arrangements, and increasing the prospects for energy self-sufficiency
   for the United States. At the same time, continuing concerns about the
   possible local health effects of hydraulic fracturing have led some
   states and communities to ban the practice altogether. The absence of a
   systematic evaluation of fracking’s health effects has complicated the
   decision process for those governments around the world who are
   debating whether to allow hydraulic fracturing.

   Hydraulic fracturing could affect human health through several
   channels, including water and air pollution. In the fracking process,
   water and other chemicals are forced into shale rock to fracture it and
   allow the gas or petroleum trapped in the shale to be tapped. Whereas
   much of the previous research has focused on water pollution (1–3),
   several recent studies address the possible effects of chemicals that
   have been found in both “fracturing fluid” (the fluid that is forced
   into the shale in order to fracture it) and in air emissions near
   fractured gas wells (4–6). One study measured various air pollutants
   weekly for a year surrounding the development of a newly fractured gas
   well and detected nonmethane hydrocarbons, methylene chloride (a toxic
   solvent), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been shown
   to affect fetal outcomes (7).

   There are at least two reasons to focus particularly on infant health
   in probing the health effects of exposure to hydraulic fracturing.
   First, there is increasing evidence that the fetus is vulnerable to a
   range of maternal pollution exposures (8–13). Second, because the fetus
   is in utero for at most 9 months, it is possible to pinpoint the timing
   of potential exposure. This is not the case with other possible health
   effects, such as cancer, that develop over long periods of time.
   Moreover, birth data are available with precise information on mothers’
   residential locations, permitting researchers to examine the effects of
   proximity to fracturing sites on the health of newborns.

   This paper provides evidence for impacts of hydraulic fracturing on
   human health, based on a large-scale analysis of vital statistics
   records from more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania during the
   period 2004–2013. Our empirical approach compares infants born to
   mothers living at different distances from hydraulically fractured well
   sites, both before and after hydraulic fracturing was initiated at the
   well site. In addition, we probe the robustness of the results by
   adjusting the estimates for maternal fixed effects to include
   comparisons of siblings who were exposed to fracking with those who
   were not. Further, we explore the relationship between infant health
   outcomes and residential distance from fracturing sites, comparing
   birth data from mothers residing at increasing 1-km intervals from the
   fracturing sites to investigate whether there is a gradient in the
   effects of exposure.

   The results of our analysis suggest that the introduction of fracking
   reduces health among infants born to mothers living within 3 km of a
   well site during pregnancy. For mothers living within 1 km, we find a
   25% increase in the probability of low birth weight (birth weight <
   2500 g) and significant declines in average birth weight and in an
   index of infant health. There are also reductions in infant health for
   mothers living within 1 to 3 km of a fracking site, but the estimates
   are about one-third to one-half of the size of those within the 0- to
   1-km band. There is little evidence of health effects at further
   distances, suggesting that health impacts are highly local.

   This paper addresses four problems that have plagued the previous
   literature (14–16). First, the sample size of this analysis is much
   larger than that used in previously published work. Second, in addition
   to examining low–birth weight status, which is the most commonly used
   measure of infant health in the literature, we use an index of infant
   health outcomes informed by the literature on multiple hypothesis
   testing (17, 18) to incorporate the many other measures of infant
   health that are available in the vital statistics data. Third, we test
   for effects at various distances of maternal residence from fracking
   sites, rather than imposing one arbitrary assumption about the distance
   where health impacts may become apparent, or about the functional form
   of the distance gradient.

   An additional innovation is that our models control for mother fixed
   effects. Estimates of fracking-independent aspects of maternal health
   in these models are controlled by comparing the health of
   fracking-exposed and unexposed siblings born to the same mother. In
   principle, this comparative technique controls for all the unobserved
   time invariant characteristics of the mother such as race that could
   confound conventional difference-in-differences estimates (that is,
   before and after comparisons of places with and without fracking).
   However, in practice, the mother fixed effects estimates are imprecise
   because there are relatively few sibling pairs with an exposed and an
   unexposed sibling even when we are examining all Pennsylvania births.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

   Figure 1 shows both the geographical distribution of births in
   Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the locations of fractured wells
   across the state. The greatest number of births occurs in the southeast
   of the state near Philadelphia, whereas fractured wells follow the
   state’s shale deposits along a diagonal path from the northeast to the
   southwest of the state. Although many areas with fracturing are lightly
   populated, the areas surrounding Pittsburgh have a high population
   density in addition to many fractured wells. Figure 2 illustrates the
   temporal distribution of fractured wells, showing that most new wells
   came online after 2009. Although the number of new wells peaked at the
   beginning of 2012, the amount and economic value of gas production
   continued to grow over our sample period.

   Fig. 1 Locations of births and fractured wells in Pennsylvania.

   Each square displayed above is 0.25° latitude by 0.25° longitude. We
   use all birth certificates in Pennsylvania for 2004–2013. They include
   maternal address which is used to calculate average yearly births per
   square. Black triangles represent the exact locations of fractured
   wells, which we observe from the Pennsylvania Department of
   Environmental Protection (DEP) Internal Operator Well Inventory. These
   data include all oil and gas wells with a Pennsylvania DEP drilling
   permit and which are not currently filled in (plugged). We queried this
   database in November 2014. Fractured wells are those marked
   “unconventional” in the database. We have dropped any wells with
   missing American Petroleum Institute numbers, spud or permit date, or
   location information.

   Fig. 2 Number of fractured wells and value of all drilling in
   Pennsylvania (2004–2013).

   The left y axis shows total fractured wells in Pennsylvania by spud
   year and quarter (that is, the commencement of drilling), and the right
   y axis reports annual values of gas from fractured wells in
   Pennsylvania. X axis shows spud year and month (dates of commencement
   of drilling) that are recorded in the Pennsylvania DEP Internal
   Operator Well Inventory, which is described in the notes to Fig. 1.
   Annual gas production per well is recorded by the Pennsylvania DEP in
   its Oil and Gas Historical Production Report. We merge these data to
   our Internal Operator Well Inventory data by well identification number
   and then sum gas production to the year level. To convert production to
   dollars, we use gas prices from the U.S. Energy Information
   Administration (EIA), which reports the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot
   Price (www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdA.htm). To convert to British
   Thermal Units annual heating values for Pennsylvania are taken from the
   EIA.

   Table 1 explores differences in maternal characteristics, infant
   characteristics, and health outcomes between mothers who were
   potentially exposed to fracturing and those who were not. The first two
   columns show variable means for mothers whose residences were less than
   1 km from a location (or multiple locations) that fractured. Columns
   (3) and (4) report the means for births to mothers who live within 3 to
   15 km of a well location. These samples are further divided into those
   whose infants were born before the spud date (that is, the commencement
   of drilling)—thus, never exposed to fracking—and those whose babies
   were born after the spud date. When the mother is within 1 km of
   multiple locations, we use the earliest spud date to align with the
   approach used in the regression analysis.
   Table 1. Difference in means.

   The data source is the universe of birth certificates in Pennsylvania
   (2004–2013) matched to the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well
   Inventory. Maternal and infant demographic indicators and health
   outcomes are recorded at the time of birth. “Near, 0–1 km” indicates
   that the mother lives within 0 to 1 km of at least one well site. “Far,
   3–15 km” indicates that the mother lives 3 to 15 km from the nearest
   well site. Columns (5) to (7) report P values from t tests of equality
   of means across the different samples indicated. Column (7) tests
   whether (2) − (1) = (4) − (3). This quantity is referred to as the
   difference-in-differences, or D-in-D.

   The remaining columns, (5) to (7), report P values from tests that the
   means are equal across the pairs of columns indicated in the row
   headings. These tests help shed light on the credibility of different
   approaches to measuring the infant health effects of fracking exposure.
   Column (5) reports P values for t tests of the hypothesis that the
   means are equal within 0 to 1 km of a well location before and after
   the spud date. These comparisons indicate that mothers whose babies
   were potentially exposed to nearby fracturing in utero are younger,
   less likely to have been married at the time of the birth, and less
   educated—characteristics that might lead to worse infant health
   outcomes even in the absence of fracturing. Column (6) reveals that
   there are also significant changes in the characteristics of infants
   and mothers who live 3 to 15 km from a fractured well site after the
   spud date, relative to before. One of the most marked differences is
   that the fraction of births to black mothers is much lower in this
   distance category after fracturing begins (and the fraction of births
   to white mothers is correspondingly higher). This difference arises
   because over time, more wells were drilled near urban areas such as
   Pittsburgh where higher numbers of African Americans live.

   A potentially valid approach to estimating the effects of fracturing is
   to use a difference-in-differences estimator that compares “before
   versus after” in the area near fracturing to “before versus after” in
   areas far from a fracturing site. This approach requires that all
   determinants of infant health except fracturing evolve identically in
   the areas near and far from fracturing. Column (7) provides an
   opportunity to gauge the credibility of this approach. It reports the P
   value from a test of the hypothesis that the difference between the
   column (1) and (2) means is equal to the difference between the column
   (3) and (4) means. The results show that using
   difference-in-differences reduces the potential for confounding
   fracking exposure with other determinants of infant health, but
   important differences in the evolution of marriage rates, race,
   education, and age remain. Although we control for all the observable
   factors in our models, these differences suggest that there may also be
   unobserved differences across areas in other factors that could
   influence infant health. This observation motivates the inclusion of
   mother fixed effects in the equation of outcomes as a function of
   potential exposure to a fractured well as shown in Eq. 2 (see Materials
   and Methods).

   Figures 3 and 4 provide an opportunity to investigate the relationship
   between distances from a fracked well and measures of infant health.
   These figures are based on estimation of Eq. 1 (see Materials and
   Methods), except that “Near” is treated as a vector of indicators for
   each 1-km distance increment from a well site, as described above. The
   unaffected group is composed of births to mothers living more than 15
   km away from a well site. The figure also shows the number of births in
   each distance category.

   Fig. 3 Effect of fracturing on low–birth weight, county fixed effects.

   The left y axis of the graph indicates coefficients and confidence
   intervals (CIs) from a version of Eq. 1 in which “Near” is replaced
   with 15 distance indicators representing the proximity of maternal
   residence to well sites; the coefficients represent the in utero effect
   on infant health of hydraulic fracturing (that is, when conception
   occurs after well spud date) at 1-km intervals from the well site. The
   data sources for the regression are all birth certificates issued in
   Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the Pennsylvania DEP Internal
   Operator Well Inventory. We exclude births with missing values for
   gestation length or latitude/longitude of maternal residence. We
   calculate the distance between maternal residence and well sites using
   Vincenty’s formula. The specification includes year fixed effects (FE),
   month of birth FE, and county of maternal residence FE. The following
   demographic controls are also included: mother is married, marital
   status missing, maternal race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic, missing),
   maternal education [no high school (HS), HS diploma, some college,
   college, advanced degree, missing], maternal age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to
   29, 30 to 34, 35+, missing), child is male, child sex missing, and
   child parity (first, second, third, fourth born and higher, parity
   missing). Standard errors are clustered on maternal ID. The right y
   axis plots average yearly births at each distance from a well site.

   Fig. 4 Effect of fracturing on infant health index, county fixed
   effects.

   The left y axis of the graph indicates coefficients and CIs from a
   version of Eq. 1 in which “Near” is replaced with 15 distance
   indicators representing the proximity of maternal residence to well
   sites; the coefficients represent the in utero effect on infant health
   of hydraulic fracturing (that is, conception occurs after well spud
   date) at 1-km intervals from the well site. The data sources for the
   regression are the universe of birth certificates issued in
   Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the Pennsylvania DEP Internal
   Operator Well Inventory. We exclude births with missing values for
   gestation length or latitude/longitude of maternal residence. We
   calculate the distance between maternal residence and well sites using
   Vincenty’s formula. The infant health index ranges from 0 to 1; an
   increase indicates better health. The regression specification includes
   year FE, month of birth FE, and county of maternal residence FE. The
   following demographic controls are also included: mother is married,
   marital status missing, maternal race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic,
   missing), maternal education (no HS, HS diploma, some college, college,
   advanced degree, missing), maternal age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to
   34, 35+, missing), child is male, child sex missing, and child parity
   (first, second, third, fourth born and higher, parity missing).
   Standard errors are clustered on maternal ID. The right y axis plots
   average yearly births at each distance from a well site.

   On the basis of these figures, we conclude that any significant effects
   of fracking exposure occur within 3 km of a well site. It is also
   evident that the largest effects are concentrated within 1 km of the
   fracking site. For example, Fig. 3 shows that the coefficient on the
   indicator for maternal residence within 1 km of a site is approximately
   0.01, indicating a 0.01 percentage point increase in the probability of
   low birth weight relative to people who live 15 km or more away from a
   site. The effect of living 1 to 2 km from a site is near zero, but the
   effect of living 2 to 3 km from a site again appears to be positive.
   Figure 4 suggests that the infant health index is worse at 0 to 1 km
   from a fracking site than at higher distances. There is some
   unavoidable arbitrariness in defining the cutoff at 3 versus 4 km;
   however, it is nevertheless evident from our data that there is little
   justification for including births at further distances in the
   potentially affected group.

   Table 2 reports the results that emerge from the estimation of Eqs. 1
   and 2. The first three columns use 0 to 1 km as the definition of
   “Near,” the next three columns use 1 to 2 km, and the last three
   columns use 2 to 3 km. In each case, the unaffected group is mothers
   who live 3 to 15 km from a site. Hence, we compare mothers at 0 to 1 km
   to mothers at 3 to 15 km, mothers at 1 to 2 km to mothers at 3 to 15
   km, etc. In each group of three columns, the first column reports
   results from fitting Eq. 1 on the entire sample. In columns (2) and
   (3), the sample is restricted to births from mothers who live within 15
   km of a well site, and these columns report on results from Eqs. 1 and
   2, respectively. Each row corresponds to a different birth outcome, so
   that each entry in the table is a separate estimate of coefficient
   a[2]. Note that because the omitted group is held constant in the
   regressions (it is always the mothers who are greater than 3 km and
   less than 15 km from a site), the regressions are not directly
   comparable to Figs. 3 and 4. In Table 2, the standard errors are
   clustered by mother. We have also estimated alternative models
   clustering by county, which yields very similar patterns.
   Table 2. Effect of fracturing on infant health.

   Each coefficient and SE (shown in parentheses) is from a different
   regression and represents the effect on the given infant health outcome
   of in utero exposure to fracturing (when conception occurs after well
   spud date) within the indicated distance. The data sources for the
   regression are all birth certificates issued in Pennsylvania from 2004
   to 2013 and the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well Inventory. We
   calculate the distance between maternal residence and well sites using
   Vincenty’s formula. The infant health index ranges from 0 to 1; an
   increase indicates better health. Each regression specification
   includes region of maternal residence*year FE, year*month of birth FE,
   and county of maternal residence FE. The following demographic controls
   are also included: mother is married, marital status missing, maternal
   race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic, missing), maternal education (no
   HS, HS diploma, some college, college, advanced degree, missing),
   maternal age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35+, missing), child
   is male, child sex missing, and child parity (first, second, third,
   fourth born and higher, parity missing). Where indicated, we include a
   vector of maternal ID fixed effects (“mother FE”). “Under 15 km”
   indicates the subset of mothers living less than 15 km from the nearest
   well site. SEs are clustered on maternal ID. ^+P < 0.10; **P < 0.05;
   ***P < 0.01.

   Column (1) suggests that maternal residence within 1 km of an active
   well site that was hydraulically fractured before conception is
   associated with significantly worse infant health outcomes than are
   more distant locations. The estimated effect on the probability of low
   birth weight is large (0.016), relative to the baseline mean incidence
   of low birth weight of 0.065. We also estimate a small but
   statistically significant negative effect on mean birth weight of about
   39 g. It is quite common in the pollution and health literature to find
   a larger effect of pollution on low–birth weight incidence than on
   average birth weight (10–13); this finding is consistent with the
   possibility that any effects are concentrated among lighter, likely
   more vulnerable, infants. Finally, the infant health index also
   suggests a relatively small but statistically significant decline in
   health; the coefficient of −0.054 means that births near a well site
   where hydraulic fracturing began before conception have a −0.054
   standard deviation decline in the health index. Limiting the sample to
   births to mothers living within 15 km, as shown in column (2), has
   little effect on the estimates, despite the sharp reduction in sample
   size.

   Column (3) reports the estimates from fitting the mother fixed effect
   specification (that is, Eq. 2) on the 15-km sample. The inclusion of
   mother fixed effects is very demanding of the data, a circumstance
   reflected in SEs, which are about twice as large as those in columns
   (1) and (2); this increased SE arises because, within the 0- to 1-km
   range, only 594 of the 1798 potentially exposed infants [see column (2)
   of Table 1] have an unexposed sibling in the data. At 2 to 3 km, 10,568
   infants are potentially exposed and 3538 have a sibling in the data—a
   better statistical situation than the 0- to 1-km cohort, but still a
   tiny fraction of the overall number of births. The pattern of the
   coefficients remains qualitatively similar, particularly for the
   incidence of low birth weight.

   The remaining columns report on the same three specifications, except
   that to test the robustness of our results to different definitions of
   “Near,” the “Near” group is defined as those living within a 1- to 2-km
   radius of a well site in columns (4) to (6) and a 2- to 3-km radius
   from a site in columns (7) to (9). These estimates indicate negative
   health effects from fracking, although they are smaller than in the 0-
   to 1-km range. For example, the estimated effects on the incidence of
   low birth weight and on the infant health index are about one-third to
   one-half of the effect size in the 0- to 1-km category. The effects on
   birth weight are smaller and statistically insignificant. When maternal
   fixed effects are added to the models, the estimates are qualitatively
   similar, although generally somewhat smaller, but the increase in the
   SEs means that these estimates are not statistically significant by
   conventional criteria.

   We additionally conducted a series of robustness checks. A potential
   concern is that the analysis is based entirely on a list of wells that
   were active in 2014 and that therefore does not include hydraulically
   fractured wells that were no longer active as of that date. These wells
   were not included because the well data set includes the spud date for
   these wells but does not report when the well became inactive. Hence,
   our baseline analysis could underestimate exposure if the wells were
   active during a woman’s pregnancy but shut down sometime after an
   infant’s birth. As a check, we reestimated the models using the full
   sample of wells, active and inactive; the results are essentially
   unchanged as shown in table S2.

   A further issue is that we have assigned “Exposure” on the basis of
   whether conception occurred after the spud date. Hence, there are some
   women for whom drilling occurred during a pregnancy that began before
   the spud date, and these women are treated as not having been exposed.
   If these women were negatively affected, then the estimates may
   understate the health effects of fracturing. Conversely, if it is
   exposure in the earliest days of the pregnancy that matters, then the
   impacts will be smaller for infants who were only exposed later in the
   pregnancy, and adding these infants to the “exposed” sample will reduce
   the estimated effects. Therefore, we reestimated the models defining
   “Exposure” on the basis of whether the birth (rather than the
   conception) occurred after the spud date. Table S3 reveals that these
   estimates are generally slightly smaller than those in Table 2,
   suggesting that infants exposed early in the pregnancy may suffer the
   most harm; however, the sampling variability makes definitive judgments
   difficult.

   We have also tried adding additional controls for area interacted with
   year to allow for secular changes in infant mortality that vary at a
   very local level. Specifically, because counties are of varying size,
   we overlaid a grid based on 0.5° of longitude and 0.5° of latitude over
   the state of Pennsylvania and estimated a model that included an
   indicator for the square in which the mother resides interacted with
   year of conception. These results are shown in table S4 and are
   qualitatively unchanged, compared to those discussed above.

   In table S5, we attempt to investigate the effects of intensity of
   exposure in the area within 1 km of a residence. For mothers living
   within 1 km of a well site, the median number of well sites is 2.
   Hence, we alter our main specification to distinguish between the
   effect of having at least one active well and the effects of having
   more than two active wells. This is a demanding test of the data, and
   we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the effects are equal
   for births exposed to above the median and below the median number of
   wells.

   Finally, the probability of a low–birth weight birth is only 6.5% in
   this sample. Of relevance to this point, all the estimates have come
   from linear probability models; given the relatively low mean, it may
   be more appropriate to rely on nonlinear estimation approaches. Table
   S6 reports the marginal effects from logit estimation of Eq. 1 on the
   15-km sample and finds that the results are qualitatively similar to
   those from the linear probability model in Table 2.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

   This paper provides evidence of effects of exposure to hydraulic
   fracturing on infant health, using a large-scale analysis of vital
   statistics records from more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania
   during the 2004–2013 period. Overall, the results suggest that the
   introduction of fracking reduces health among infants born to mothers
   living within 3 km of a well site during pregnancy. We find the largest
   effects for mothers living within 1 km of a site—a 25% increase in the
   probability of a low–birth weight birth (<2500 g) and significant
   declines in average birth weight, as well as in an index of infant
   health. There are also reductions in infant health for mothers living
   within 1 to 3 km of a fracking site, but the estimates are about
   one-third to one-half of the size of those for mothers within the 0- to
   1-km band. There is little evidence of health effects at further
   distances, suggesting that health impacts are highly local.

   What do these estimated impacts imply for the affected infants? Studies
   based on large administrative databases have consistently shown that
   low birth weight is a risk factor for numerous negative outcomes,
   including infant mortality, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
   asthma, lower test scores, lower schooling attainment, lower earnings,
   and higher rates of social welfare program participation (19, 20). For
   example, one large-scale study of twin pairs in Norway found that a 10%
   difference in birth weight in their predominantly low–birth weight
   pairs was associated with a 1% difference in the probability of
   graduating from high school and a 1% difference in earnings, with
   outcomes all being better for the higher-weight twin (20).

   Are these effects large or small relative to those found in other
   studies? Many other studies examine the effects of exposure to
   criterion air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide or nitrous oxides,
   rather than the specific types of hazardous air pollutants that have
   been noted near some fracking sites (4–7). For example, a study of the
   installation of EZ Pass toll plazas in New Jersey and Pennsylvania
   showed that EZ Pass was associated with reductions of 40% in CO and 11%
   in NO, which in turn reduced the incidence of low birth weight by 12%
   among mothers living within 2 km of a toll plaza (13). A recent study
   of openings and closings of industrial plants that emit hazardous air
   pollutants, such as benzene (one of the chemicals that has been found
   near fracking sites), suggested that plant operation is associated with
   a roughly 3% increase in the incidence of low birth weight among
   mothers within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the plants (12). Thus, this paper’s
   estimated findings of a 25% increase in the probability of a low–birth
   weight birth within 1 km and smaller effects at larger distances are
   not inconsistent with the findings that have been reported in previous
   studies of the effects of air pollution on fetal health.

   Available data sources allow for some rough estimates of the number of
   births in the United States annually that are at risk from fracking.
   Specifically, we combined data from the National Center for Health
   Statistics (NCHS) on the number of births by county from July 2012
   through June 2013, with data on the number of fractured wells in 2012
   from HPDI, an information services company in the energy industry. The
   NCHS data are only available by county (whereas our Pennsylvania birth
   data have women’s exact addresses), but by assuming a uniform
   distribution of population across counties, we can estimate the number
   of births to women within 1 km of an active well that was hydraulically
   fractured in that year. Although the HPDA data do not have a fracking
   indicator, we infer it by using information on which wells are in tight
   oil or shale gas plays; hydraulic fracturing is generally required for
   the efficient recovery of oil and gas in these areas. These
   calculations suggest that as many as 65,000 infants were potentially
   exposed nationally in this 1-year period because their mothers live
   within 1 km of a well site that is likely to have been fractured.

   The superior data available in Pennsylvania allow us to compare the
   estimated number of births exposed to the actual number of infants
   exposed to fracking during gestation. This comparison suggests that the
   assumption of a uniform distribution of births across counties leads to
   substantial overestimates of the number of infants born within 1 km of
   an active well site that was fractured; presumably, this is because
   fracking occurs in less populated parts of counties where there are
   fewer births per square kilometer. When we scale our national estimate
   downwards using the ratio of estimated to actual exposed births for
   Pennsylvania, we estimate that approximately 29,000 U.S. infants were
   exposed (that is, born to mothers living within 1 km of an active well
   that was fracked) between July 2012 and June 2013. This is about 0.7%
   of the infants born in the United States over that period.

   A limitation of our study is that given the nature of the available
   data, we are constrained to focus on potential exposure to pollution
   (which is determined by the mother’s residential location) rather than
   actual exposure that could be measured with personal monitoring
   devices. In principle, future research could measure the types and
   amounts of chemicals emitted by hydraulic fracturing, the distance that
   those chemicals are transported under normal weather conditions, and
   the likely effects of those specific chemicals on fetal health and on
   the health of children and adults.

   A second limitation of our study is that even starting with the whole
   population of Pennsylvania births, we end up with a relatively small
   sample of children who were potentially exposed to fracking; this small
   effective sample size limits our ability to probe the shape of the
   distance-exposure relationship and also limits our ability to obtain
   precise estimates from models with mother fixed effects.

   A third caveat is that the pathway of exposure was not a subject of our
   study and is not known with certainty. The results of our study are
   consistent with the possibility that very local air pollution, perhaps
   from the multiple diesel generators used at well sites, from chemicals
   used in fracking, or even from truck traffic to and from sites, could
   be a potential key source of exposure. Previous research regarding
   human health effects of exposure to hydraulic fracturing has also
   identified contaminated water as a possible pathway. Although
   industrial activity from hydraulic fracturing and improper disposal of
   fracturing fluids can affect water quality, recent analyses suggest
   that it is not common for fracturing fluids to leak into surface water
   from the fractured well sites (1, 2). Tighter regulation of fluid
   disposal and fracturing activities may have mitigated threats to water
   quality; nevertheless, this potential avenue for deleterious effects on
   human health effects also deserves careful monitoring.

   A fourth caveat is that, to the extent that there are economic benefits
   of fracking that accrue to women who live less than 1 km from a
   fracking site, our estimates could understate the specific effects of
   fracking exposure on human health. If, for example, women living near
   wells receive income from mineral rights, then the higher income per se
   could be expected to confer a health benefit, which might partially
   offset the negative effects of fracking-related pollution.

   Finally, future research should focus on a richer set of outcomes,
   including child health at older ages and adult health. These outcomes
   can be difficult to track, but creative uses of administrative data may
   provide compelling opportunities to more thoroughly investigate the
   local health consequences of exposure to hydraulically fractured well
   sites.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

   The data for this project came from two sources. First, data on all
   births in Pennsylvania were obtained from the Certificate of Live
   Births (birth certificates) from 2004 to 2013. These data include a
   record for every birth, and each record has information about the
   infant’s health at birth as well as latitude and longitude of the
   maternal residence and maternal characteristics such as race,
   education, and marital status. Because we used confidential data, our
   study protocol was vetted by Princeton University’s Institutional
   Review Board. Siblings were matched using the mother’s full maiden
   name, race and birth date, as well as father’s information, and social
   security numbers where available.

   There are many possible health outcomes listed on birth certificates,
   several of which represent rare outcomes. In what follows, we focus on
   birth weight and low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500 g),
   which are the most commonly examined measure of fetal health outcomes
   in the environmental economics literature. Birth weight is commonly
   examined because it has been the most widely available measure, it is
   relatively accurately measured, and low birth weight is quite common
   unlike conditions such as specific congenital anomalies, for example.

   We also show estimated effects on a composite infant health index that
   is constructed to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1, with positive
   (negative) values indicating above (below) average infant health
   (measured in SDs). Our index is suggested by the literature on multiple
   hypothesis testing (17, 18). If there are k outcomes and Y[k] is the
   kth, then let μ[k] be the mean and σ[k] be the SD. We normalize our
   outcomes by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SE: Y[k]* = (Y[k]
   − μ[k])/σ[k]. The summary index is then Y* = Σ[k]Y[k]*/K. We construct
   two versions of this summary index, one using the full sample of births
   and one using the subsample of births within 15 km of a well. The index
   is the mean over the standardized outcomes, weighted by the inverse
   covariance matrix of the transformed outcomes to ensure that outcomes
   that are highly correlated with each other receive less weight than
   those that represent new information.

   The index is a combination of birth weight in grams and indicators for
   low birth weight, prematurity (gestation less than 37 weeks), the
   presence of any congenital anomalies, and the presence of any other
   abnormal condition of the newborn. The index provides a solution to the
   challenges to inference from separately examining the multiple measures
   of infant health (that is, “multiple hypothesis” testing). The problem
   is that the probability that at least one estimated effect is deemed
   “significant” increases with the number of tests. Focusing on an index
   avoids this difficulty. The index is defined so that a larger value
   indicates more positive health.

   We focus on a sample of singleton births because twins and other
   multiples are generally in poorer health at birth for reasons unrelated
   to hydraulic fracturing. After excluding births with missing
   information, we are left with an initial birth sample of 1,125,748
   births, of which 270,410 are within 15 km of a site where a fractured
   well was active in 2014. From the initial sample of 1,449,427 births,
   we lose the following: 55,337 births that were part of a multiple
   birth; 25,029 births that were missing values for gestational age,
   birth weight, congenital anomalies, or abnormal conditions of the
   newborn; 226,548 births that were missing latitude and longitude;
   41,789 births missing a maternal identifier; and 146 duplicate records.
   The sum of the missing categories above exceeds the number of cases
   lost because some cases are missing more than one set of variables.

   The second source of data is a list of all of the fractured wells that
   were active in 2014 in the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well
   Inventory (21). Fractured wells are those marked “unconventional” in
   the database. For each well, we know the location and the date (month
   and year) that it was fractured. There are 7757 active fractured wells
   in our data, the vast majority of which were fractured after 2009.
   Below, we show that the focus on active wells, rather than all fracked
   wells, does not alter the results.

   To match births to fractured gas wells, we computed the distance from
   the mother’s residence to all locations where fracturing ever took
   place between 2004 and 2013, regardless of whether the fracturing had
   yet occurred at the time of the conception. Distances were computed
   using Vincenty’s formula for calculating the distance between two
   points on a sphere. In our sample, there are 24,148 births to mothers
   residing less than 2 km from a site where fracturing ever occurred and
   6669 living within 1 km of a site where fracturing ever occurred; of
   this last group, 1798 births were potentially exposed to active
   fracturing at some point while in utero, because the conception date
   occurred after the date that drilling was initiated (that is, the spud
   date).

   We estimate several different statistical models with and without
   sibling comparisons. Some models are estimated using the entire sample
   of Pennsylvania births, whereas others focus only on births within 15
   km of a well site. The latter sample excludes births in Philadelphia,
   for example, where there is no fracturing and birth outcomes may be
   changing differentially from those in the rest of the state for reasons
   unrelated to the proliferation of fracturing.

   The first specification that we estimate is Embedded Image Embedded
   Image (1)where Y[it] is a birth outcome for mother i in year t.
   County[it] is a vector of zero-one indicators for the mother’s county
   of residence at the time of the birth, Time[it] is a vector of zero-one
   indicators for the birth month and year (for example, October 2006),
   and Regional_trend[it] is a region-specific linear time trend based on
   a division of Pennsylvania into six regions (22). The vector X[it] of
   observable maternal and child characteristics includes indicators for
   child gender, maternal race and ethnicity (African-American, Hispanic,
   missing), mother’s age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35+,
   missing), mother’s education (<high school, high school, some college,
   college, advanced degree, missing), marital status (including an
   indicator for missing marital status), and child parity (first, second,
   third, fourth born or higher, parity missing). One reason for
   controlling for parity is that in our data, the exposed sibling tends
   to be younger than the unexposed sibling in a sibling pair, so that it
   is important to control for birth order effects.

   To develop our measure of exposure, we first define two vectors for
   each birth, each of which contains a separate element/variable for each
   well site observed in the data. The “proximity” vector consists of
   indicator variables for each well site regardless of whether it had
   been fractured at the time of the birth. These indicators are equal to
   1 if the distance between maternal residence and the given well site is
   within a short distance (that is, 0 to 1, 1 to 2, or 2 to 3 km in
   alternative specifications) and 0 otherwise. We then define an
   indicator, Near[i], that is the result of applying the maximum operator
   to the full vector for birth i. That is, if there are any wells within
   the specified radius, then this indicator Near[i] will take the value 1
   and 0 otherwise. This variable is a practical solution to summarizing
   the information on distance associated with each of the nearly 8000
   wells; specifically, it is a measure of whether there is at least one
   well in the relevant distance category and it is a key covariate in Eq.
   1.

   The “timing” vector also has a separate indicator for each well that is
   equal to 1 if conception occurred after the spud date and 0 otherwise.
   The idea is that it is implausible that a well could affect infant
   health before it is spudded. The differences in spud dates across
   wells, even with relatively small geographic areas, mean that it is
   possible to include month-year indicators and region-specific time
   trends to adjust for any underlying time effects.

   Having defined these two vectors, we multiply to create a new vector
   and apply the maximum operator to the product vector. The result is the
   indicator variable Exposure[it], which is equal to 1 for births near
   any well sites for which the spud date precedes conception and is equal
   to 0 otherwise. Thus, after adjustment for the full set of covariates
   described in the preceding paragraphs, the key parameter of interest is
   a[2,] which measures whether there are changes in infant health near
   well sites where hydraulic fracturing started before the conception
   date.

   One reason why birth outcomes might differ in an area before and after
   fracking is that the population of mothers may change with active
   fracturing. Previous work has shown, for example, that housing prices
   can be affected by industrial activity (12, 23, 24), which could be
   expected to change the population living nearby over time. One way to
   deal with this problem is to compare each mother to herself. Hence, we
   next estimate Embedded Image Embedded Image (2)which differs from the
   study of Bamberger and Oswald (4) in that it includes a constant term
   for each mother, a[i]. Because the a[i] absorbs the effect of any
   constant or time invariant characteristics (that is, race, education,
   etc.) of the mother, the vector X′[it] now includes only time-varying
   elements of X[it]. Table S1 reveals that mothers with multiple births
   are more likely to be married and also more likely to have either high
   or low levels of education. Hence, although Eq. 2 removes concerns
   about confounding fracking exposure with other determinants of infant
   health, it is possible that the effects of exposure to fracking differ
   in the subpopulation of mothers with more than one child in the data.

   Three additional details are worth noting. First, there was no a priori
   correct way to define “Near” because there is no physical law that
   determines the distance at which fracking-related activities
   potentially affect infant health. Consequently, we estimated models
   that explore the effect of each additional kilometer of distance from a
   well. These models took the same form as Eq. 1, except that “Near” was
   replaced with a vector of indicators for whether the mother lived 0 to
   1, 1 to 2 km, 2 to 3, …, 10 to 15 km from a well. The omitted distance
   category was greater than 15 km. A mother’s residence can be both 0 to
   1 km from one well and 2 to 3 km from another; hence, these categories
   are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We also calculated 15
   “Exposure” variables analogously to the way these indicators were
   described above; the coefficients associated with these variables test
   for any changes in infant health in these 15 distance bands around well
   sites where hydraulic fracturing started before the conception date,
   relative to the rest of Pennsylvania. We found little evidence of an
   effect of fracking exposure on infant health at distances greater than
   3 km, and this motivated our focus on 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 km as
   the definitions of “Near,” as well as the use of infants born to
   mothers living more than 3 km away as the comparison group.

   A second issue is that secular trends in infant health outcomes may
   differ across small geographic areas (that is, because of hospital
   closings or openings or local economic shocks). For this reason, the
   subsequent analysis reports result from the estimation of versions of
   Eqs. 1 and 2 that limit the sample to a 15-km radius around a well
   site. The advantage of this smaller sample is that mothers living 3 to
   15 km away from a well site may be affected by the same economic shocks
   as those who live within 3 km. In contrast, this assumption seems less
   likely to be valid for mothers living further away, for example in
   Philadelphia. In addition, rather than only allowing time trends to
   vary by region, we also defined a 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude grid
   and controlled for a time trend for each cell in this grid. This
   alternate specification provides a flexible method to adjust for
   secular changes in infant health that are unrelated to fracking
   exposure.

   All models were estimated using the REG and XTREG commands in STATA
   14.0. The SEs in these and all our models were clustered by mother to
   allow for correlations between siblings in other determinants of birth
   outcomes.

Abstract

   The Greenland Ice Sheet holds 7.2 m of sea level equivalent and in
   recent decades, rising temperatures have led to accelerated mass loss.
   Current ice margin recession is led by the retreat of outlet glaciers,
   large rivers of ice ending in narrow fjords that drain the interior. We
   pair an outlet glacier–resolving ice sheet model with a comprehensive
   uncertainty quantification to estimate Greenland’s contribution to sea
   level over the next millennium. We find that Greenland could contribute
   5 to 33 cm to sea level by 2100, with discharge from outlet glaciers
   contributing 8 to 45% of total mass loss. Our analysis shows that
   uncertainties in projecting mass loss are dominated by uncertainties in
   climate scenarios and surface processes, whereas uncertainties in
   calving and frontal melt play a minor role. We project that Greenland
   will very likely become ice free within a millennium without
   substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

INTRODUCTION

   Ice sheets lose mass through runoff of surface meltwater and ice
   discharge into the surrounding ocean, and increases in both over the
   past two decades have resulted in accelerated mass loss from the
   Greenland Ice Sheet (1, 2). Between 1995 and 1998, subsurface ocean
   temperatures rose by about 1.5°C along the west coast of Greenland as a
   result of increasing subsurface water temperatures in the subpolar gyre
   (3). These warm waters led to a disintegration of buttressing floating
   ice tongues (3), which triggered a positive feedback between retreat,
   thinning, and outlet glacier acceleration (outlet glacier–acceleration
   feedback) (4). A stark example is Jakobshavn Isbræ, Greenland’s largest
   and fastest flowing outlet glacier. Following the loss of its floating
   tongue between 2000 and 2003, the glacier’s flow speeds doubled as the
   ice thinned (5, 6). Since then, rapid increases in ice discharge have
   been observed in many outlet glaciers around Greenland, including
   Sverdrup Gletscher and Ummiamaku Isbræ on the northwest coast and Køge
   Bugt and Kangerdlugssuaq Gletscher on the southeast coast (7). Between
   1990 and 2008, surface melt nearly doubled in magnitude, most notably
   in southwest Greenland (8), resulting in additional widespread thinning
   at lower elevations. Thinning lowers the ice surface and exposes it to
   higher air temperatures, thereby leading to enhanced melt (surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback), establishing a second positive feedback
   for mass loss. The existence of such positive feedbacks can lead to
   strongly nonlinear responses of the ice sheet to environmental forcings
   (9).

   As recognized in previous reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change, the ability to track outlet glacier behavior is
   necessary to accurately project ice sheet evolution, yet previous
   studies (10, 11) had limited success due to a lack of accurate ice
   thickness (12), a leading order constraint on ice flow. Consequently,
   major progress was not possible until 2014, when a new high-resolution
   ice thickness map (13) became available that now allows capturing
   outlet glacier flow with high fidelity (12).

   Here, we present a new assessment of the response of the Greenland Ice
   Sheet to future warming using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model [PISM;
   (14)], which is capable of reproducing the complex flow patterns
   evident in Greenland’s outlet glaciers (12). PISM simulates the
   evolution of ice geometry and ice flow. We use three extended
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) emissions scenarios (15):
   a pathway with reduced greenhouse gas emissions that aligns with
   meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement (RCP 2.6), an
   intermediate pathway (RCP 4.5), and a high-emissions pathway (RCP 8.5).
   For these pathways, we derive air temperature anomalies from global
   climate model (GCM) realizations (Fig. 1A), which we use to adjust
   present-day temperatures and precipitation based on climatologies from
   the high-resolution (∼5.5 km) regional climate model HIRHAM5 (16).
   Because most GCM projections are only available until 2300, we extend
   the temperature anomalies by linearly extrapolating the 2200–2300 trend
   to the year 2500 and keeping the 2500 monthly values constant afterward
   (see Materials and Methods). At the ice-ocean interface, we prescribe
   submarine melt (i.e., melt at the ice front and below ice shelves from
   the water in contact) with parameterizations informed by observations
   (17, 18, 19), numerical modeling (20), and theoretical considerations
   (21), and we assume that ocean temperatures rise at the same rate as
   atmospheric temperatures. To estimate the impact of parametric
   uncertainties for each of the three emissions scenarios, we perform a
   rigorous 500-member ensemble of simulations in which we vary 11 key
   model parameters governing atmospheric forcing, surface processes,
   submarine melt, calving, and ice dynamics. In addition, we identify a
   control simulation for each scenario, which we use for inter-scenario
   comparisons.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Greenland in a thousand years

   In a thousand years, the Greenland Ice Sheet will look significantly
   different than today (Fig. 2). Depending on the emission scenario, the
   Greenland Ice Sheet will have lost 8 to 25% (RCP 2.6), 26 to 57% (RCP
   4.5), or 72 to 100% (RCP 8.5) of its present-day mass, contributing
   0.59 to 1.88 m, 1.86 to 4.17 m, or 5.23 to 7.28 m to global mean sea
   level, respectively, where ranges refer to the 16th and 84th
   percentiles (Fig. 1B and Table 1). We illustrate the range of possible
   ice sheet trajectories by computing the probability, in our 500-run
   ensemble, that a given location is ice covered after 1000 years (Fig.
   2, B to E). The ice sheet following the RCP 2.6 emissions path will
   very likely experience significant margin recession in the west and
   north (Fig. 2B). For the control simulation, ice flow in this ice sheet
   shows patterns similar to present day in the southeast and southwest
   (Fig. 2F). RCP 4.5 results in large retreats around all of Greenland,
   with the exception of high-elevation areas in the east of the southern
   and central domes (Fig. 2C). Fast flow in this reduced ice sheet
   configuration is still topographically concentrated in channels that
   reach below sea level. A wide swath of outlet glaciers feed fjords in
   west-central Greenland, and the contemporary large outlet glaciers of
   northwestern and northeastern Greenland merge into a few ice
   stream–like features (Fig. 2G). For RCP 8.5, 67% of the ensemble
   members lose >90% of the initial volume, and 58% of ensemble members
   lose >99% of initial ice volume, including the control simulation (Fig.
   2D). Evidently, by continuing on the RCP 8.5 path, it is very likely
   that Greenland will become ice free within a millennium.

Partitioning mass loss

   At the beginning of the 21st century, mass loss was roughly equally
   split between surface meltwater runoff and ice discharge (sum of
   mechanical calving and frontal melt) into the surrounding ocean, albeit
   with high year-to-year variations (22). Our simulated mass loss for the
   same period is consistent with this observation (Fig. 1). During the
   21st and 22nd centuries, ice discharge remains a major contributor to
   mass loss regardless of the emissions scenario (Figs. 1, D and E, and
   3), contributing 2 to 39 cm to sea level by 2200, corresponding to 6 to
   45% of the total mass loss. Over time, however, the relative importance
   of ice discharge diminishes, except for RCP 8.5. Under this scenario,
   mass loss is sufficiently large for the ice margin to retreat into
   interior areas below sea level, resulting in large calving fronts and
   increased ice discharge. The exact timing of this increase varies
   across RCP 8.5 ensemble members, resulting in a marked increase in the
   variance of the relative contribution of ice discharge to mass loss at
   the beginning of the 23rd century.

   Fig. 3 Evolution of ice sheet area and mass balance components for the
   control simulation for each RCP scenario.

   (A to C) Ice area evolution. (D to F) Partitioning of ice sheet wide
   mass balance rates into snow accumulation, runoff, and ice discharge
   into the ocean shown in Gt year^−1 (D to F) and kg m^−2 year^−1 (left
   axis) and m year^−1 ice equivalent (right axis) (G to I). We
   distinguish between runoff due to climate warming and runoff due to
   surface elevation lowering. (A) to (I) are plotted as 11-year running
   means.

   In a warming climate, precipitation (and thus snow accumulation) is
   expected to increase because of the higher moisture holding ability of
   warmer air. Here, we increase precipitation by 5 to 7% for each degree
   of warming (23). We find that in our simulations, total snow
   accumulation over the ice sheet remains relatively steady over time for
   RCPs 2.6 and 4.5 (Fig. 3, D and E), since decreasing ice sheet area is
   offset by an increase in snow accumulation per unit area due to
   increasing precipitation (Fig. 3, J and K). Under RCP 8.5, however, the
   decrease in snow accumulation due to accumulation area reduction (Fig.
   3C) outpaces the increase in snow accumulation due to warming, and
   thus, total snow accumulation decreases after around year 2200 (Fig.
   3F). Toward the end of the millennium, snow accumulation per unit area
   increases as the Greenland Ice Sheet is reduced to a few high-elevation
   areas in the southeast (Fig. 3I). For RCP 8.5, ice sheet–wide surface
   meltwater runoff rates decrease after passing a maximum around year
   2500 despite continuously increasing runoff rates per unit area. At the
   time of the maximum, runoff exceeds snow accumulation by a factor of
   about 17. Surface melt is amplified by the positive surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback as surface lowering exposes the ice to
   higher air temperatures. To assess the role of this feedback in driving
   increases in surface melt, we perform a simulation assuming no changes
   in surface elevation for the calculation of the air temperatures (i.e.,
   setting the temperature lapse rate to zero). We find that in all
   scenarios, the increased melt rates per unit area caused by higher air
   temperatures due to climate change exceeds the impact of higher
   temperatures due to surface lowering (Fig. 3, G to I). In our
   simulations, temperatures are kept constant beyond the year 2500, yet
   Greenland continues to lose mass in part because of the surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback. This committed sea level rise (24)
   demonstrates that stabilization of mass change will be more difficult
   as time passes.

Additional feedbacks at play

   Besides the surface mass balance–elevation feedback and the outlet
   glacier–thinning feedback, additional negative and positive feedbacks
   are at play. A negative feedback that can reduce mass loss is
   glacio-isostatic adjustment that results from unloading of the
   lithosphere due to ice loss. The uplift of bedrock is caused by the
   viscoelastic response of the underlying mantle and, as a consequence,
   will reduce the surface area that is exposed to surface melt and the
   ice area in direct contact with ocean water. However, because of the
   high mantle viscosity, this process is relatively slow, causing
   millimeters to centimeters per year rates of uplift. For each RCP
   scenario, we perform a simulation without glacio-isostatic adjustment
   and find that this effect is negligible on the centennial time scale,
   and after a millennium, mass loss is reduced by only about 2%, which is
   much less than the variance of the ensemble simulations on the 16th or
   84th percentile (Table 1).

   Another negative feedback is the coastward advection of deep cold ice,
   which increases ice viscosity and basal stickiness and decreases mass
   loss by reducing flow rates. This feedback competes with the positive
   feedback of inland migration of decreased basal stickiness due to
   outlet glacier acceleration and thinning (fig. S1). Acceleration of
   outlet glaciers not only leads to enhanced ice discharge but also
   contributes indirectly to increased surface runoff via the surface mass
   balance–elevation feedback: Thinning induced by outlet glacier
   acceleration lowers the ice surface in the vicinity of the glacier
   terminus, resulting in enhanced melt. While our model takes these three
   feedbacks into account, their impact is, however, difficult to
   quantify.

   Positive feedbacks that we have not considered, but are potentially
   relevant, are the effect of enhanced surface melt affecting basal
   motion (25), warming of the ice by refreezing of meltwater
   [“cryo-hydrologic warming” (26)], and ice cliff failure (27). These
   three feedbacks, if taken into account, could further increase our mass
   loss estimates. Last, geomorphological processes such as bedrock
   erosion, sediment transport, and deposition could affect ice sheet
   evolution on centennial and longer time scales (28); however, whether
   these processes would amplify or slow down mass loss is not clear (29).

Outlet glacier retreat

   Observations indicate that Greenland’s 200+ major outlet glaciers have
   displayed a marked asynchronicity in retreat behavior (30). Even
   adjacent glaciers that experience similar environmental conditions may
   behave differently because retreat is strongly controlled by glacier
   geometry (31). Our simulations produce similar behavior, as illustrated
   by two examples. In west-central Greenland, Store Gletscher’s current
   extent is strongly controlled by geometry because its terminus resides
   on a local bedrock high, and high frontal melt rates are required to
   thin the glacier to flotation and cause retreat (32). In our
   simulations, once Store Gletscher loses contact with the bedrock high,
   it retreats within a decade or less over a distance of about 25 km
   until it becomes land terminating (Fig. 4). This behavior is observed
   in all three RCP scenarios but occurs later under lower emissions
   scenarios (not shown). Upernavik Isstrøm South, in the same region,
   exhibits a more gradual retreat in the simulations due to a smoother
   bed topography. Both glaciers accelerate during retreat and then slow
   down at stable front positions on bedrock highs while thinning
   continues. Once thinned to flotation at this local high point, the
   glaciers retreat again. In our simulations, both Store Gletscher and
   Upernavik Isstrøm South undergo several episodes of fast retreat.
   During these episodes, maximum speeds are comparable between individual
   episodes, but maximum fluxes (product of ice thickness and vertically
   averaged velocity) decline over time because of thinning, a behavior
   that was also reported by Nick et al. (33).

   Fig. 4 Retreat of two outlet glaciers in a similar climatic setting
   between 2015 and 2315 for the RCP 4.5 scenario.

   (A) Upernavik Isstrøm South (UIS) shows a gradual retreat of about 50
   km over the next 200 years. (B) Store Gletscher (SG) is currently in a
   very stable position on a bedrock high. It takes almost a hundred years
   before substantial retreat happens. However, once the glacier loses
   contact with the bedrock high, retreat of 25 km occurs in less than a
   decade. The glacier retreats quickly until it is out of the water.
   Every line represents a year (A and B). (C) Location of the two outlet
   glaciers on the west coast, present-day observed surface speeds (61),
   and flow lines of Upernavik Isstrøm South and Store Gletscher (white
   dashed lines). Small inset shows area where the two glaciers are
   located.

   Over time, ice sheet–wide ice discharge decreases because of outlet
   glacier thinning and outlet glaciers becoming land terminating (Fig.
   3). Because the flow of outlet glaciers is strongly controlled by
   geometry (34) and most of the submarine channels beneath large outlet
   glaciers extend only to about 100 km inland, their potential for
   sustained fast retreat (and large ice discharge) is limited. Jakobshavn
   Isbræ, Humboldt Gletscher, and Petermann Gletscher, however, have
   channels that extend far into the ice sheet interior (13), and these
   glaciers are responsible for much of the asymmetric retreat (Fig. 2, F
   and G). By the year 2300 (RCP 8.5) or 2500 (RCP 4.5), almost all outlet
   glaciers in northwest Greenland have become land terminating, and ice
   discharge there is greatly reduced. In contrast, in southeast
   Greenland, outlet glaciers retreat substantially only for the RCP 8.5
   scenario, and ice discharge remains an important contributor to mass
   loss even for the RCP 8.5 scenario until the 23rd century. However,
   future ice discharge in the southeast may be underestimated in our
   simulations because of inaccurate subglacial topography. Aschwanden et
   al. (12) already reported poor agreement between observed and modeled
   surface speeds for several glaciers in southeast Greenland and
   attributed the mismatch to poorly constrained ice thickness. This
   hypothesis was recently corroborated by inversion of gravimetric data
   that revealed glacial fjords several hundreds of meters deeper than
   previously assumed (35).

   To characterize the importance of capturing outlet glacier flow, we
   performed a simulation where flow was calculated because of vertical
   shearing at a coarse horizontal grid resolution of 18 km, ignoring
   longitudinal stresses relevant for outlet glacier flow. For RCPs 2.6
   and 4.5, this approach underestimates mass loss by a meter sea level
   equivalent at year 3000 compared to the control simulation (Table 1),
   with a projected mass gain of 25 cm sea level equivalent for RCP 2.6.
   While under RCP 8.5, Greenland will become ice free whether outlet
   glaciers are resolved or not, larger mass loss occurs in the early
   centuries in the control simulation, with the nonresolving simulation
   underestimating mass loss by >10% by the year 2300. Large mass loss in
   early centuries may make a recovery harder, even if climate warming
   were to reverse. Consequently, it is crucial to resolve outlet glaciers
   to reduce uncertainties in mass loss projections.

Uncertainty quantification

   Our large ensemble of simulations allows us to attribute the fraction
   of mass loss uncertainty due to poorly constrained model parameters
   using Sobol indices (36). The sum of Sobol indices must be less than
   unity because the combination of variance produced by all parameters
   simultaneously must be less than the total variance.

   Across all RCP scenarios, we find that 26 to 53% of mass loss
   uncertainty in the 21st century is caused by underconstrained ice
   dynamics parameters, particularly uncertainty in basal motion (Table
   2). This percentage declines to 5 to 38% in the 22nd century and
   steadily decreases to 2 to 33% by the year 2300 (Table 2). Over time,
   uncertainty in ice dynamics explains a progressively smaller fraction
   of mass loss variance, while the uncertainty in climate forcing
   (temperature projections in particular) explains an increasingly large
   fraction of the total ensemble variance, reaching 7 to 45% by the year
   2300. We note that beyond year 2300, the calculated variance is likely
   to underestimate the true variance because temperature projections are
   not available and we instead produce temperature projections via
   extrapolation (see Materials and Methods).
   Table 2 Sobol indices computed from large ensemble of simulations.

   Values represent the percentage of variance in mass loss attributable
   to the variance in a given parameter. Large values imply that
   uncertainty in that parameter is responsible for a commensurately large
   uncertainty in mass loss. Small values imply that uncertainty in a
   given parameter has relatively little effect on uncertainty in total
   mass loss. Numbers for the variance in air temperature for year 3000
   are in parentheses because they do not reflect the GCM intermodel
   variability but the choice of extrapolation.

   Surface processes such as melt and refreezing are the result of a
   complex surface energy balance. Here, we make the first-order
   assumption that melt is proportional to the sum of days with
   temperatures above freezing. While more sophisticated approaches exist,
   they are not computationally tractable on the long time scales and the
   number of ensembles considered here; they also suffer from
   underconstrained parameters (37). We find that uncertainties in surface
   processes are the dominant source of uncertainties across RCPs until
   year 2300, ranging from 14 to 50%. Between melt and refreezing,
   refreezing contributes little to uncertainties in surface processes.

   The mass loss variance explained by uncertainties in submarine melt and
   calving parameters is <5% for all scenarios and at all times. We
   emphasize that this does not necessarily imply that these mechanisms
   are unimportant for ice sheet evolution. Rather, variability in
   parameter values over their plausible ranges produces relatively little
   corresponding variability in simulated mass loss. However, such
   variability can have large regional impacts, and many of the frontal
   mass loss parameters are empirical and based on recent observations.
   Furthermore, basal motion is generally high near marine termini,
   leading to a tight coupling between ocean and basal processes. Thus, it
   may be difficult to separate the variance in mass loss explained by
   basal motion from the variance explained by ocean forcing. Our findings
   suggest that better constraints on basal motion modeling are critical
   for reducing uncertainties in prediction of mass loss over the next two
   centuries, and a reduction in uncertainty of temperature projections
   and for surface mass balance will lead to better predictions of
   Greenland mass loss over multicentennial and longer time scales.

Perspectives

   Our simulations suggest that by following the RCP 8.5 scenario, the
   Greenland Ice Sheet will disappear within a millennium and that the
   contribution of discharge from outlet glaciers will remain a key
   component of mass loss over the next centuries. Better quantification
   of feedbacks that interlink and amplify mass loss processes will help
   in understanding the extent to which these feedbacks make changes in
   the Greenland Ice Sheet nonreversible. Because of these feedbacks,
   delaying mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is likely to increase
   sea level rise, even with future significant reductions of emissions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ice sheet model

   Simulations are performed with the open-source PISM (14), which is
   thermomechanically coupled and polythermal (38) and uses a hybrid
   stress balance (39), making PISM well suited for Greenland (12).
   Horizontal grid resolution ranges from 450 m to 18 km, with the control
   simulations, and the ensemble simulations using resolutions of 900 and
   1800 m, respectively. At the basal boundary, geothermal flux varies in
   space (40), and a pseudoplastic power law relates bed-parallel shear
   stress and sliding; details are given in (12). Compared to (12),
   subglacial topography was updated to version 3; submarine melting at
   vertical ice fronts was implemented; and a new stress-based calving law
   suitable for outlet glaciers was implemented (32). To track the bedrock
   response to a changing ice load, PISM uses the model of the viscous
   half-space overlain by an elastic plate lithosphere (41).

Atmospheric forcing

   The spatial and seasonal distributions of 2-m air temperature [T[0](x,
   y, t)] and precipitation [P[0](x, y, t)] to force PISM are provided by
   the regional climate model HIRHAM5 (16) at a resolution of 0.05 (∼5.55
   km), which was forced at the lateral boundaries using the European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis
   product (42). We use fields of daily mean temperature and total
   precipitation averaged over 2000–2015 (43). Here, both P[0] and T[0]
   are periodic in time with a period of 1 year.

   To perform future simulations, we adjust T[0](x, y, t) by scalar
   temperature anomalies ΔT[air](t) derived from a GCM from the fifth
   phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). As most
   CMIP5 simulations are only available until 2100, we select the four
   GCMs that extend to year 2300: GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and
   MPI-ESM-LR. To calculate ΔT[air](t), we first extract monthly
   near-surface temperature averaged over the domain containing Greenland
   (12°W to 73°W and 59°N to 84°N). We then extend the resulting
   temperature series beyond 2300 by linearly extrapolating the 2200–2300
   trend to the year 2500, after which we keep the 2500 monthly values
   constant. Our choice of linear trend extrapolation is supported by GCM
   simulations with Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE2
   (44). Last, we subtract the 2006–2015 monthly means from the time
   series to create anomalies ΔT[air] (fig. S2). The resulting temperature
   anomalies fall within the ±1σ of the CMIP5 ensemble, which consists of
   27 (RCP 2.6), 38 (RCP 4.5), and 40 (RCP 8.5) model realizations. Future
   air temperatures T(x, y, t) are then computed
   byT(x,y,t)=T0(x,y,t)+ΔTΓ(x,y,t)+ΔTair(t)where ΔT[Γ](x, y, t) is the
   temperature adjustment due to the differences between the time-evolving
   modeled ice surface elevation and the fixed topography used by HIRHAM5
   via a standard atmospheric lapse rate Γ of 6 K km^−1. Precipitation is
   increased as a function of air temperature
   increaseP(x,y,t)=P0(x,y,t)×exp(c⋅ΔTair(t))where the value of c
   corresponds to the change of 5 to 7% per Kelvin (23).

Climatic mass balance

   The ice flow model requires climatic mass balance (i.e., the balance of
   accumulation, melt, and refreezing) as a surface boundary condition for
   mass conservation and temperature for conservation of energy.
   Accumulation is computed from precipitation and 2-m air temperature;
   precipitation falls as snow at temperatures below 0°C and as rain at
   temperatures above 2°C, with a linear transition in between. Surface
   melt is computed by a temperature index model (45), which uses 2-m air
   temperature as input. Melt factors for snow are used if snow or firn is
   exposed at the surface, and melt factors for ice are used otherwise.

   We use a simple firn model that only allows removal of firn. At the
   beginning of the simulation, the firn layer thickness is set to the
   average depth of the 750 kg m^−3 isopycnal calculated by the HIRHAM5
   for the period 2000–2015 after an offline spin-up of the snow and firn
   pack for a 100-year period using the downscaled 1979 ERA-Interim
   atmospheric forcing (fig. S3A) (43). Refreezing and retention of liquid
   water in the firn model is based on the control run parametrization
   given in (43), where the density and cold content of the snow layers
   determine the refreezing capacity. Where firn is present, the firn
   layer thickness is reduced by the amount of melted firn.

Submarine melt

   We define submarine melt as the sum of melt occurring at front of
   marine terminating outlet glaciers and melt below ice shelves. Frontal
   melt is primarily controlled by subglacial discharge and thermal
   forcing, as supported by observations (18, 46), numerical modeling
   (20), and theoretical considerations (21). We parameterize the
   present-day submarine melt rate ṁxo using a linear function of
   latitude L between 71°N and
   80°Nṁxo(L)={ṁ71,L<71°ṁ71+19(L−71)(ṁ80−ṁ71),71°≤L≤80°,ṁ80,L>80°whe
   re the values of ṁ71 and ṁ80 were chosen using the following
   observations. At Jakobshavn Isbræ (69°10′N, 49°50′W), Motyka et al.
   (17) estimated an area-averaged subshelf melt rate of 228 ± 49 m
   year^−1 in 1985 with an increase of 57 ± 12 m year^−1 afterward;
   however, melt rates close to the grounding line are considerably higher
   than area averages. August 2010 frontal melt rates at Store Glacier
   (70°22′N, 50°8′W) were 1100 ± 365 m day^−1 (18). Inferred contemporary
   subshelf melt rates at Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79 North Glacier; 79°0′N,
   20°0′W) are 13.3 ± 4 m year^−1, whereas at Zachariæ Isstrøm (78°0′N,
   30°0′W), melt rates increased from 14.6 ± 4.1 m year^−1 (1999–2010) to
   25 ± 12 m year^−1 (2010–2014) (19). To capture the observed spatial and
   temporal variability and associated uncertainties, we consider three
   scenarios: “LOW”: (ṁ71,ṁ80)=(300,10) m year^−1, “MID”:
   (ṁ71,ṁ80)=(400,20) m year^−1, and “HIGH”: (ṁ71,ṁ80)=(500,30) m
   year^−1.

   The parameterization of the temporal variability is inspired by Xu et
   al. (18), who calculate submarine melt ṁ as a function of subglacial
   discharge Q[sgl] and thermal forcing T[h]ṁ=(AQsglα+B)⋅Thβ(1)with 0.5 ≲
   α ≲ 1 and 1 ≲ β ≲ 1.6 (18). From Eq. 1, we derive an expression for
   submarine melt anomalies ṁto(ΔTair) as a function air temperature
   anomalies ΔT[air](t). First, we assume subglacial discharge Q[sgl] to
   equal surface meltwater runoff Q[r]. Second, we express Q[r] as
   function of air temperature anomalies ΔT[air](t). We fit a linear
   function Q[r] = aT[a] + b (a = 0.50, b = 0.8, r^2 = 0.93) (fig. S3C)
   through mean summer (June-July-August) derived air temperatures T[a]
   and surface meltwater runoff Q[r] extracted from simulations with the
   regional climate model MARv3.5.2 2006–2100 forced with CanESM2, MIROC5,
   and NorESM2, each with the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios (47). Last, we
   express the thermal forcing T[h] in terms of ΔT[air]. While the ocean
   warms slower than the atmosphere, we ignore this lag and assume that
   ocean thermal forcing T[h] increases by 1 K for every 1-K increase in
   air temperature. We thus scale submarine melt by a function of
   temperature anomalies
   ΔT[air]ṁ(x,y,t)=ṁxo(L(x,y))⋅ṁto(ΔTair(t)),ṁto(ΔTair)=1+C(aΔTair)αΔT
   airβ

   We use three scenarios for m˙to: LOW uses α = 0.5 and β = 1.0, MID uses
   α = 0.54 and β = 1.17, and HIGH uses α = 0.85 and β = 1.61. We tuned C
   = 0.15 so that for a warming of ΔT[air] = 8 K, submarine melt rates
   increase by a factor of ≈6 to 24 m year^−1 to 3000 to 12,000 m year^−1,
   which should be viewed as an upper bound (fig. S4D).

Calving

   Calving, using a von Mises yield criterion, occurs when the maximum
   tensile stress exceeds σ[max] (32). In addition, calving occurs below a
   minimum floating ice thickness, motivated by the following
   observations. In 2008, only six perennial ice shelves remained
   [Petermann Gletscher, Steensby Gletscher, Ryder Gletscher,
   Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79 North), Zachariæ Isstrøm, and Storstrømmen],
   all north of 76°N. Minimum shelf thickness near the calving front of
   these shelves ranges from 60 to 100 m (13). In contrast, Jakobshavn
   Isbræ’s (69°10′N, 49°50′W) floating tongue had a minimum thickness of
   ∼600 m at the calving front (17). Guided by these observations, we
   prescribe the minimum floating ice thickness h[min] as a linear
   function of latitude between 74°N and 76°N. South of 74°N and north of
   76°N, values are kept constant at h[74] and h[76], respectively. To
   capture the observed spatial and temporal variability and associated
   uncertainties, we consider three scenarios; LOW: h[min] = (h[74],
   h[76]) = (400,50) m, MID: h[min] = (h[74], h[76]) = (500,100) m, and
   HIGH: h[min] = (h[74], h[76]) = (600,150) m.

Ice dynamics

   Aschwanden et al. (12) performed a thorough calibration of parameters
   related to ice dynamics, such that simulated surface speeds agree well
   with observed winter 2008 speeds (48), and we adopt these parameters.
   The two key parameters here are the Shallow Ice Approximation
   enhancement factor and the exponent of the sliding law. The enhancement
   factor E appears in the effective viscosity of glacier ice,
   η2η=(E A)−1(τe2+ε2)1−n2n(2)where τ[e] is the effective stress, A is the
   enthalpy-dependent rate factor, and n is the exponent of the power law.
   The small constant ε (units of stress) regularizes the flow law at low
   effective stress, avoiding the problem of infinite viscosity at zero
   deviatoric stress. The pseudoplastic power law (49) relates
   bed-parallel shear stress t[b] and the sliding velocity
   u[b]tb=−τc ub∣ub∣(1−q)u0q(3)where τ[c] is the yield stress, q is the
   pseudoplasticity exponent, and u[0] = 100 m year^−1 is a threshold
   speed. We assume that yield stress τ[c] is proportional to effective
   pressure N [“Mohr-Coulomb criterion” (50)]τc=(tanϕ) N(4)where ϕ is the
   till friction angle and the effective pressure N is given in (51,
   52)N=δPo10(e0/Cc)(1−(W/Wmax))(5)

   Here, δ = 0.02 is a lower limit of the effective pressure, expressed as
   a fraction of overburden pressure, e[0] is the void ratio at a
   reference effective pressure N[0], C[c] is the coefficient of
   compressibility of the sediment, W is the effective thickness of water,
   and W^max is the maximum amount of basal water. We use a nonconserving
   hydrology model that connects W to the basal melt rate B˙b
   (51)∂W∂t=B˙bρw−Cd(6)where ρ[w] is the density of water and C[d] = 1 mm
   year^−1 is a fixed drainage rate. The basal stickiness β is a measure
   of the glacier bed’s resistance to basal motion and is defined
   asβ=τc∣ub∣(1−q)u0q(7)

Ice sheet initial conditions

   Ice sheet initial conditions are provided by the “calibrated”
   experiments in (12), which includes a 125-ka paleoclimate simulation
   followed by calibration of ice dynamical parameters to minimized
   differences between observed (48) and simulated surface velocities.
   Using this as a starting point, we then ran a 100-year long relaxation
   simulation to account for differences/updates in model physics, but we
   kept the ice surface close to observations using a flux correction
   (12). The result was an initial state that is both close to the
   observed geometry (53) and surface speeds (48) of 2008. On the time
   scale considered here, predictions of ice sheet behavior are similar to
   climate forecasts where initial conditions have little impact on the
   long-term evolution (54). The bedrock deformation model is initialized
   with present-day subglacial topography (13) and viscous uplift rates
   (fig. S3B) (55).

Ensemble analysis

   Many physical processes governing ice sheet evolution are not precisely
   constrained. To assess the sensitivity of volume change estimates to
   these uncertainties, we performed a large ensemble of simulations, with
   11 key parameters drawn from a priori probability distributions of
   plausible values (table S2). Instead of probing such a large parameter
   space, for each RCP scenario, we produced 500 parameter combinations
   using Latin hypercube sampling (56), which ensures that the ensemble is
   optimally representative of the joint distribution of parameters, while
   gaining efficiency relative to factorial or Monte Carlo designs by
   eliminating potential redundancies. We vary parameters drawn from five
   broadly defined groups: (i) Climate: We select the four GCM projections
   with equal probability and model the percentage increase in
   precipitation per 1 K increase in air temperature, ω, as a uniform
   distribution bounded by 5 and 7% K^−1 (23). (ii) Surface processes:
   Parameters governing the interaction between the climate and the ice
   sheet surface mass balance include a positive degree-day ice melt
   factor f[i], positive degree-day snow melt factor f[s], and refreezing
   proportion ψ. Literature values for the ice melt factor f[i] range from
   8 to 40 mm K^−1 day^−1 (57, 58); however, a comparison with the mean
   2000–2015 surface mass balance simulated with HIRHAM5’s energy balance
   model reveals that values ≫8 mm K^−1 day^−1 significantly overestimate
   melt (not shown). We thus use a truncated normal distributions with
   mean μ = 8 mm K^−1 day^−1 and SD σ = 4 mm K^−1 day^−1. For the snow
   melt factor f[s], we also use a truncated normal distribution with a
   mean μ = 4.1 mm K^−1 day^−1 and an SD of 1.5 mm K^−1 day^−1 (59). The
   amount of annual snow fall that is allowed to refreeze ψ is also
   modeled as a truncated normal, but with a mean μ = 50% and SD σ = 20%
   to cover reported literature values (60). (iii) Ocean: We specify three
   suites of parameters corresponding to low, moderate, and high regimes
   for both the spatial m˙x and the temporal m˙t variability in submarine
   melt. These parameter suites are sampled with equal probability. We
   specify three suites of parameters corresponding to low, moderate, and
   high regimes of minimum shelf thickness h[min]. These three scenarios
   are selected with equal probability. The maximum tensile stress of a
   marine terminus σ[max] is modeled as a normal distribution
   symmetrically truncated above 1.4 MPa and below 0.7 MPa (32). (iv) Ice
   dynamics: Aschwanden et al. (12) performed a calibration of ice
   dynamical parameters and found values of q = 0.6 for the exponent of
   the sliding law and E = 1.25 for the shallow ice enhancement factor to
   result in good agreement with observed flow speeds. Here, we use a
   truncated normal distribution for q with μ = 0.6 and σ = 0.2, whereas E
   is modeled with a γ distribution centered around 1.25.

   To attribute uncertainties in mass loss to parametric uncertainties, we
   compute main-effect Sobol indices for each input variable (36).
   Main-effect Sobol indices can be interpreted as the fraction of output
   variance that is explained by the variance in a given input parameter,
   neglecting second-order effects due to parameter interactions. Thus,
   the Sobol indices produced for a given output (in our case total mass
   change) always sum to less than unity. Typically, a large fraction of
   unity signifies that interactions between parameter uncertainty are of
   second-order importance.

Additional simulations

   We also identified an optimal (control) simulation (CTRL) that best
   reproduces the 2000–2015 mean surface mass balance calculated by
   HIRHAM5. To characterize model behavior, we performed additional
   simulations at horizontal grid resolutions ranging from 450 m (G450) to
   18 km (G18000) and found that outlet glacier behavior is well captured
   at horizontal grid resolutions less than 2 km (fig. S4), in agreement
   with (12). The simulation at 450 m was only performed for RCP 4.5 from
   2008 until 2200 because of large file sizes. We also performed two
   additional simulations at a resolution of 900 m, one without
   glacio-isostatic adjustment (“NGIA”) and one without a lapse rate
   (“NTLR”). We used the surface meltwater runoff from the NTLR simulation
   to approximate the meltwater runoff due to anomaly air temperature
   warming. To characterize the importance of resolving outlet glacier
   flow, we performed a simulation that calculates flow due to horizontal
   shearing only at a horizontal grid resolution of 18 km (SIA18000).

Abstract

   Variations in Earth’s orbit pace the glacial-interglacial cycles of the
   Quaternary, but the mechanisms that transform regional and seasonal
   variations in solar insolation into glacial-interglacial cycles are
   still elusive. Here, we present transient simulations of coevolution of
   climate, ice sheets, and carbon cycle over the past 3 million years. We
   show that a gradual lowering of atmospheric CO[2] and regolith removal
   are essential to reproduce the evolution of climate variability over
   the Quaternary. The long-term CO[2] decrease leads to the initiation of
   Northern Hemisphere glaciation and an increase in the amplitude of
   glacial-interglacial variations, while the combined effect of CO[2]
   decline and regolith removal controls the timing of the transition from
   a 41,000- to 100,000-year world. Our results suggest that the current
   CO[2] concentration is unprecedented over the past 3 million years and
   that global temperature never exceeded the preindustrial value by more
   than 2°C during the Quaternary.

INTRODUCTION

   The Quaternary is characterized by the appearance of
   glacial-interglacial cycles caused by the cyclic growth and decay of
   continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Before the
   initiation of NH glaciation at ~2.7 million years (Ma) ago, as
   indicated by the appearance of ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic,
   the growth of NH ice sheets was probably suppressed by elevated
   atmospheric CO[2] (1, 2). Afterward, benthic δ^18O records (3) show a
   trend toward larger ice sheets and colder climate over the Quaternary,
   together with an increase in the amplitude of the glacial-interglacial
   variability (4). Of particular interest is the transition between ~1.25
   and ~0.7 Ma ago, known as the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) (5–7),
   from mostly symmetric cycles with a period of about 41 thousand years
   (ka) to strongly asymmetric 100-ka cycles. Several hypotheses for the
   mechanism of the MPT have been proposed. One of them invokes a gradual
   decline of CO[2] during the past 3 Ma to explain both the onset of
   Greenland (2, 8) and, more generally, NH glaciations (1) and the MPT
   transition (9–11). Another hypothesis attributes the MPT to a gradual
   removal of a thick regolith layer from North America and northern
   Europe (12–14).

   The atmospheric CO[2] concentration is accurately known only for the
   past ~800 ka, the period covered by ice core data. Nevertheless,
   proxy-based reconstructions suggest that, over the past ~2 Ma, CO[2]
   was not very different from the concentrations measured in ice cores
   (15–17) but that it was substantially higher during the late Pliocene
   (18, 19).

   It has been postulated that NH continents were all covered by regolith
   before the Quaternary, an expected outcome of the 10^7 to 10^8 years
   that the bedrock was exposed to weathering before the initiation of
   glacial cycles (7). The observed present-day regolith distribution (20,
   21), which is characterized by exposed bedrock over large parts of
   northern North America and Eurasia, is a result of glacial erosion by
   Quaternary ice sheets. A gradual removal of regolith by glacial erosion
   could have changed the ice sheets’ response to orbital forcing. Changes
   in regolith distribution may affect glacial cycles through several
   mechanisms. The first one is based on the fact that, in the case of
   temperate-base ice sheets, the sliding velocity of ice is much higher
   in the presence of a thick regolith layer as compared to exposed rocks
   (12). This makes ice sheets more mobile, thinner, and more susceptible
   to orbital forcing. In addition to this mechanism, Ganopolski and Calov
   (13) also found that, in the case when ice sheets expand well into
   areas covered by regolith, enhanced deposition of glaciogenic dust over
   the southern margins of NH ice sheets substantially lowers snow albedo,
   thereby facilitating melting and preventing growing of large ice
   sheets.

   It has been shown that modeling of long (100 ka) and strongly
   asymmetric glacial cycles of the late Quaternary requires both the
   presence of large areas of northern continents with exposed rocks and a
   relatively low atmospheric CO[2] concentration (13, 22, 23). Here, we
   investigate the origin of the major transitions in Quaternary climate
   dynamics by performing a large set of transient simulations with the
   Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 (24).

RESULTS

Transient model simulations

   CLIMBER-2 includes atmosphere, ocean, vegetation, global carbon, and
   dust models and the three-dimensional thermomechanical ice sheet model
   SICOPOLIS (25). It has been recently applied for simulating the last
   four glacial cycles with a fully interactive carbon cycle (26). There,
   we demonstrated that glacial lowering of atmospheric CO[2] in the model
   is controlled by lowered sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and changes in
   ocean circulation, in particular enhancement of Antarctic bottom waters
   and decrease of deep ocean ventilation. Elevated carbonate weathering
   on exposed shelves and enhanced nutrient utilization in the Southern
   Ocean due to enhanced dust deposition also play important roles,
   especially toward glacial maxima (27). Reorganizations of the Atlantic
   meridional overturning circulation during glacial terminations
   contribute substantially to deglacial CO[2] rise. The terrestrial
   carbon cycle, which includes novel components such as permafrost
   carbon, peat, and carbon buried under ice sheets, plays a minor role in
   atmospheric CO[2] dynamics on orbital time scales (26).

   To perform multiple simulations covering the entire Quaternary, we use
   a novel technique of splitting long-term simulations over the past 3 Ma
   into shorter intervals. In total, we perform more than 1000 model
   simulations, each 500 ka long, starting from the same initial
   conditions but at different points in time (Materials and Methods and
   fig. S1). This approach allows us to analyze the robustness of glacial
   cycles by testing whether different simulations converge to the same
   solution, and also has the advantage that it reduces the potential
   problem with long-term model drifts in the global carbon cycle. Model
   drifts can occur because, in our modeling setup, the carbon cycle is
   not closed. There are geologic sinks (burial in ocean sediments) and
   sources (carbonate weathering and volcanic CO[2] outgassing), and even
   a tiny imbalance between them can cause a pronounced drift toward too
   high or too low CO[2] concentrations on time scales of millions of
   years.

CO[2] outgassing and regolith scenarios

   To test the effect of a gradual CO[2] decrease on Quaternary climate
   dynamics, we use prescribed volcanic CO[2] outgassing to control the
   mean CO[2] concentration in the model. Small changes in volcanic
   outgassing represent a possible candidate to explain a long-term CO[2]
   decrease, because even the value for the current volcanic outgassing is
   very uncertain (28). Alternatively, the same trend in CO[2] can be
   explained by a similarly small increase in average weathering rate
   and/or organic carbon burial in deep-sea sediments (29).

   On the basis of the evidence for CO[2] decrease and regolith removal
   over the Quaternary, we created different scenarios for CO[2]
   outgassing and regolith distribution, which were then used to drive the
   model together with orbital variations (see Materials and Methods; Fig.
   1, B and C; and fig. S3). The need for these scenarios originates from
   the absence of appropriate models that can be used to simulate the
   evolution of these two factors on the million-year time scale. The
   initial and final values of volcanic outgassing are determined using an
   inverse modeling approach (see Materials and Methods), while the
   initial and final spatial distributions of regolith are either known
   from observation or strongly constrained by empirical data. Therefore,
   the scenarios differ only in their temporal evolution (Fig. 1, B and
   C). For each of the 16 different combinations of regolith and volcanic
   outgassing scenarios, we run the model over the past 3 Ma using the
   time-splitting technique and selected the best scenario by minimizing
   the difference between simulated and observed benthic δ^18O (Fig. 1D;
   see also Materials and Methods) (3).

   (C). PD, present-day constant regolith and volcanic CO[2] outgassing.
   The optimal scenarios, those minimizing root mean square error and
   maximizing correlation, are indicated by the white circles in (D) and
   by the thicker lines in (B) and (C).

Transient simulations with optimal CO[2] outgassing and regolith scenarios

   When the model is driven by orbital variations and the optimal regolith
   and volcanic outgassing scenarios, it reproduces the evolution of many
   reconstructed characteristics of Quaternary glacial cycles (Fig. 2). It
   simulates most of the details of the observed benthic δ^18O curve (Fig.
   2A), including long-term trends and glacial-interglacial variability.
   The relative contribution of deep-sea temperature and sea-level
   variations to δ^18O variability changes substantially through time,
   with temperature variations being more important during the early
   Quaternary and sea-level variations dominating the signal during the
   late Quaternary (Fig. 3). The model also captures the secular cooling
   trend of ~−1°C/Ma in SSTs (Fig. 2E). The intensification of NH
   glaciation after ~2.7 Ma ago is marked by a rather abrupt increase in
   global ice volume variations (Fig. 2B) and an increase in ice flux from
   the Laurentide ice sheet into the North Atlantic, in good agreement
   with a proxy for ice-rafted debris (Fig. 2C) (30). Interglacial
   atmospheric CO[2] concentrations decrease from values of ~350 parts per
   million (ppm) during the late Pliocene to values between 260 and 290
   ppm, typical of the past 800 ka, at ~1 Ma ago (Fig. 2D). The amplitude
   of glacial-interglacial CO[2] variations increases from ~50 ppm at the
   beginning of the Quaternary to ~80 to 90 ppm during the 100-ka cycles
   of the past million years. This suggests that, for the early
   Quaternary, the large spreading between and within different CO[2]
   reconstructions markedly overestimates real CO[2] variability. In
   agreement with (17), a substantial fraction of the increase in the
   magnitude of glacial-interglacial CO[2] changes is attributed to a
   larger contribution of the iron fertilization mechanism, which, in
   turn, is related to an increase in dust deposition rate over the
   Southern Ocean during late Quaternary glacial cycles (Fig. 2G). Various
   previous modeling studies have attempted to derive continuous CO[2]
   records for the pre–ice core time using different methods and
   assumptions. van de Wal et al. (31) derived CO[2] concentrations that
   are substantially lower than our estimates for the late Pliocene and
   early Quaternary, with values never exceeding 300 ppm (fig. S6B). The
   more recent reconstruction by (32) shows a much larger glacial
   interglacial variability, particularly before the MPT, compared to our
   results. The CO[2] scenario that we derived for the
   Pliocene-Pleistocene between 3 and 2.4 Ma ago in a previous study (1)
   is comparable to the results presented in this study (fig. S6B). During
   the late Pliocene, simulated global surface air temperature varies by
   less than 1°C in response to variations in Earth’s orbit, with
   interglacial temperatures ~1.5°C warmer than at preindustrial (Fig.
   2F). Successively, glacial-interglacial temperature variability
   gradually increases, reaching values up to ~6°C during the past million
   years. Simulated global temperatures never exceed 2°C above the
   preindustrial over the past 3 Ma (Fig. 2F). At ~1 Ma ago, the main
   periodicity of modeled δ^18O variations changes from 41 to 100 ka (Fig.
   4). Before that, the model mostly responds to obliquity forcing at the
   41-ka period, in agreement with data (Fig. 4). However, the model shows
   a larger response to precession than is observed, possibly because of a
   missing dynamic Antarctic ice sheet in the model (33) or because the
   benthic δ^18O stack is orbitally tuned to obliquity (3). SST, CO[2],
   and sea level show a similar transition from 41 to 100 ka (fig. S5).
   The ice sheets are generally thinner before compared to after the MPT
   (Fig. 5), but the pre- and post-MPT maximum areal ice extent is
   comparable over Scandinavia and eastern North America, broadly in
   accordance with available observations (7). The model results are
   compared to additional observations in fig. S6.

   extent at the last glacial maximum.

   The fact that our model has problems at simulating the strong glacial
   cycle between 500 and 400 ka ago is not surprising because it occurred
   during a period of very weak orbital forcing. There were so far only
   few attempts to simulate this period of time with sufficiently
   realistic climate–ice sheet models (9, 34), and they all reveal
   problems with simulation of this time interval, suggesting that current
   climate–ice sheet models are not nonlinear enough to properly simulate
   this challenging interval.

Robustness of glacial cycles

   The question of whether glacial cycles are deterministic or stochastic
   has been highly debated, and a complete spectrum of opinions—from
   chaotic to perfectly deterministic—exists (35–37). In most cases, our
   model simulations that started at different points in time converge to
   one and the same solution (Fig. 2 and fig. S1), close to
   reconstructions, providing a strong indication that glacial cycles are
   robust. The glacial cycles of the 41-ka world are particularly robust,
   which is expected because they represent a relatively linear response
   to variations in obliquity (4). The 100-ka cycles appear to be less
   robust, because they involve a much more nonlinear response to orbital
   forcing. However, the good agreement between the bulk of the model
   simulations and the reconstructed glacial cycles evolution over the
   past 1 Ma (Fig. 2A), except for MIS11, indicates that the observed
   realization was the most likely, although not the only possible one.
   This finding is fully consistent with that of Tzedakis et al. (35), who
   demonstrated that the most probable timing of the most recent glacial
   terminations is close to that seen in paleoclimate records.

Separate effects of CO[2] outgassing and regolith scenarios

   To assess the influence of the different factors on Quaternary glacial
   cycles, we performed a set of additional experiments where we fixed
   regolith distribution and/or volcanic outgassing to present-day
   conditions. When the model is driven by orbital variations as the only
   external forcing (Fig. 1A), modeling results and data diverge markedly
   before the MPT, with the model simulating pronounced 100-ka cycles
   throughout the whole 3 Ma (Fig. 6A). These results confirm that orbital
   forcing alone cannot explain the evolution in Quaternary glacial
   cycles. When the optimal regolith removal scenario (Fig. 1B) is
   prescribed additionally to orbital forcing, but volcanic outgassing is
   held constant, the model simulates a transition from 41- to 100-ka
   cycles (Fig. 6B), with the precise timing of this transition depending
   on the regolith removal scenario (fig. S4). At the same time, these
   simulations fail to reproduce the general increase in δ^18O between 3
   and 1 Ma ago (Fig. 6B) and the reconstructed global cooling trend in
   SSTs (fig. S8D). Last, a decrease in volcanic CO[2] outgassing (Fig.
   1C), together with orbital forcing but with the prescribed present-day
   regolith cover, captures the trends in δ^18O (Fig. 6C) and SSTs (fig.
   S2C). It can also explain a transition from 41- to 100-ka glacial
   cycles, but for any plausible CO[2] scenario, this transition occurs
   much earlier than in reality (fig. S2).

DISCUSSION

   Our transient modeling results demonstrate that both previously
   proposed mechanisms—regolith removal and gradual lowering of CO[2]—are
   essential to reproduce the realistic evolution of climate variability
   during the Quaternary, and their combination controls the timing of
   regime changes of climate variability. Note that a gradual change of
   the regolith cover causes a rather rapid (few hundred thousand years)
   transition from the 41- to 100-ka world, in good agreement with
   observational data. Simulated glacial cycles only weakly depend on
   initial conditions and therefore represent a quasi-deterministic
   response of the Earth system to orbital forcing. Our results also
   support the notion that the current CO[2] concentration of more than
   400 ppm is unprecedented over at least the past 3 Ma and that global
   temperature did not exceed the preindustrial value by more than 2°C
   during the Quaternary. In the context of future climate change, this
   implies that a failure in substantially reducing CO[2] emissions to
   comply with the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming well
   below 2°C will not only bring Earth’s climate away from Holocene-like
   conditions but also push it beyond climatic conditions experienced
   during the entire current geological period.

   The results of our study are based on an Earth system model of
   intermediate complexity, whose high computational efficiency needed for
   simulations on a million-year time scale is achieved by using a rather
   coarse spatial resolution and considerable simplifications in the
   description of individual processes, in particular atmospheric
   dynamics. Further progress in understanding of Quaternary climate
   dynamics would require the use of complex Earth system models. However,
   moving Quaternary modeling to a qualitatively new level would require
   not only the use of existing complex models but also substantial
   progress in modeling of ice sheet–solid Earth interaction (38) and, in
   particular, its impact on long-term landscape evolution, sediments
   transport (21), global dust and carbon cycles, and other processes that
   are not yet properly understood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Model

   For this study, we used the Earth system model of intermediate
   complexity CLIMBER-2 (24), which incorporates the three-dimensional
   thermomechanical ice sheet model SICOPOLIS (25). SICOPOLIS is a shallow
   ice approximation model, which treats marine ice by allowing grounded
   ice to propagate over the continental shelf. This enables the model to
   resemble to a good approximation the Earth ice cover during the
   Quaternary, including grounded marine ice, which is a considerable
   portion of the northern European ice cover during cold phases.
   SICOPOLIS is applied only to the NH with a spatial resolution of 1.5° ×
   0.75° and is fully interactively coupled to the low-resolution climate
   component and a model of deep permafrost (39). Meltwater and iceberg
   fluxes directly affect ocean circulation. Forced by orbital variations
   and prescribed radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, the model has
   been applied to simulate the last eight glacial cycles (13). CLIMBER-2
   also includes a global carbon cycle model (27) and has been the first
   model to reproduce the main characteristics of the last four glacial
   cycles with orbital forcing as the only prescribed external forcing
   (26). Because CLIMBER-2 does not include methane and nitrous oxide
   cycles and does not account for these greenhouse gases in its radiative
   scheme, we made use of the fact that CO[2] is the dominant greenhouse
   gas and that, on orbital time scales, variations of the other two
   follow rather closely CO[2] during the past 800 ka (40). To account for
   the effect of methane and nitrous oxide on radiative forcing, we
   computed the effective CO[2] concentration used in the radiative scheme
   of the model in such a way that radiative forcing of equivalent CO[2]
   exceeds radiative forcing of simulated CO[2] by 30% at any time (26).
   Unlike the previous model version, the model used in this study also
   includes a fully interactive dust cycle model (41), with the
   atmospheric dust load directly affecting the shortwave radiative
   balance of the atmosphere and dust deposition on snow reducing surface
   albedo. Benthic δ^18O is estimated from the modeled sea level, z[SL],
   and deep ocean temperature, T[d], as follows: δ^18O = 4.0 − 0.22 T[d] −
   0.01 z[SL]. The temperature sensitivity factor is from (42), and the
   sea-level factor is from (43). Sea level is computed from the volume of
   modeled NH ice sheets assuming an additional 10% contribution from
   Antarctica. It has to be noted that this assumption rules out possible
   canceling NH/Southern Hemisphere precessional-phase contributions for
   δ^18O and sea level (33).

   The SST used to compare the stack of (18) is computed as the annual
   average SST of the model grid cells that contain the sediment cores
   from which the stack of (18) was derived. The SST computed this way
   turns out to differ substantially from the global SST in the model,
   particularly in the long-term trend.

Transient simulations, splitting in time technique

   We then used CLIMBER-2 to perform transient simulations of the past 3
   Ma. In principle, it would be possible to perform one single transient
   simulation from 3 Ma ago to the present, but this would be impractical
   because of the long time (more than a month) it would take for a
   complete simulation. In addition, even very small imbalances in the
   carbon cycle would cause the model to drift away on such long time
   scales. We therefore applied a splitting in time technique, which
   consists of running many model simulations for 500 ka starting at
   different times from 3.25 Ma ago until 150 ka ago at time intervals of
   100 ka. For all runs, the model was initialized using identical
   preindustrial interglacial conditions as described in (26). All model
   runs were thus started from the same initial state of the
   climate-carbon cycle–ice sheet system, but with differing orbital
   configuration, regolith distribution, and volcanic CO[2] outgassing
   according to the initial astronomical time. We then discarded the
   initial 100 ka of each simulation as model spin-up and analyzed the
   remaining 400 ka (fig. S1).

   The application of the time-splitting method generates an ensemble of
   model simulations that are (partly) overlapping in time and may not
   necessary converge to the same solution at all points in time. However,
   for spectral and wavelet analysis, a continuous time series is
   required. The simplest way to derive such a time series is by computing
   the mean over the ensemble members at each point in time. This is what
   is used in, e.g., Fig. 4. Using the ensemble median instead results in
   only small differences compared to the mean. The choice of the method
   to aggregate the ensemble simulations into one time series has
   therefore a negligible impact on the power and wavelet spectra.

External forcings

   In the transient simulations, we prescribed the changes in Earth’s
   orbital parameters, a schematic temporal evolution of regolith mask,
   and a time-dependent rate of volcanic CO[2] outgassing as the only
   external drivers.

Orbital forcing

   Earth’s orbital parameters are well known for the past 3 Ma based on
   the astronomical solutions of (44).

Regolith cover scenarios

   The presence of regolith in our model has a dual effect on the ice
   sheets: (i) It enhances the velocity of ice sheet sliding over regions
   where the ice base is at its pressure melting point by a factor of 5,
   implying that basal velocity is five times higher for the same basal
   shear stress than for a sediment-free surface, roughly consistent with
   similar modeling approaches (22), and (ii) it increases the production
   of glaciogenic dust around the margins of the ice sheets, which affects
   surface albedo and facilitates surface melt (45). The present-day
   regolith mask was derived from the sediment thickness dataset of (20).
   Areas with sediment thickness larger than 100 m are assumed to be
   covered by regolith. The remaining areas, mainly large parts of North
   America and Scandinavia (fig. S3), are characterized by exposed
   crystalline bedrock. We assumed that the presently exposed bedrock
   areas are a result of glacial erosion by the Pleistocene ice flow
   associated with the waxing and waning of NH ice sheets and therefore
   considered all continents to be covered by regolith at 3 Ma ago, before
   the onset of NH glaciation. We then created 14 intermediate regolith
   masks by applying a two-dimensional backward diffusion process to the
   present-day regolith mask (fig. S3). Over Scandinavia, the applied
   diffusion coefficient is spatially uniform, while over North America,
   we started by diffusing the regolith mask northward from the southern
   margin of exposed bedrock until all continent is covered by regolith.
   In the resulting scenario, sediments were therefore first removed from
   the Arctic Archipelago, the area that we expect was the first to be
   affected by ice sheet growth at the onset of NH glaciation. Then,
   regolith was gradually removed in the area around the Hudson Bay and
   successively also further south and over Scandinavia. Some exposed
   bedrock is assumed to be present over Greenland at 3 Ma ago, but this
   assumption does not affect the results presented in the paper. With
   this procedure, we obtained the 16 regolith masks shown in fig. S3. By
   shifting these masks in time, we then created four scenarios that
   differ in the timing of regolith removal (Fig. 1B).

   The most recent reconstruction of pre-Quaternary geography (46)
   indicates that the elevation was similar to present (no notable uplift
   during the past 3 Ma), but Hudson Bay and Canadian Arctic Archipelago
   were absent. Indirect data also suggest that the Hudson Bay only
   developed during the late Quaternary. These differences in geography do
   have some, but not critically important, impact on glacial cycles.
   However, the temporal evolution of geography is unknown, and we decided
   to prescribe present-day geography and elevation.

Volcanic CO[2] outgassing scenarios

   To control the mean atmospheric concentration of CO[2] in the model, we
   used small changes in the prescribed volcanic CO[2] outgassing. The
   present-day volcanic outgassing used in the model is 5.3 Tmol C/year,
   which is the value that balances the weathering rate (26). The value of
   volcanic CO[2] outgassing for ~3 Ma ago has been derived from fitting
   modeling results to the benthic δ^18O stack. For that, we used an
   ensemble of transient model simulations initialized at 3.2 Ma ago and
   run for 500 ka driven by orbital variations, with continents fully
   covered by regolith and prescribed constant volcanic CO[2] outgassing
   ranging from 5.3 to 6.5 Tmol C/year. The different values of volcanic
   CO[2] outgassing lead to different modeled CO[2] concentrations. A best
   fit of modeled benthic δ^18O to the stack of (3) during interglacials
   is used to constrain the value of CO[2] outgassing to 6.2 Tmol C/year
   for the time interval between 3 and 2.7 Ma ago. Some recent studies
   suggest that Antarctica could have contributed up to 20 m of sea-level
   equivalent during the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene (47, 48). That
   would translate in a ~0.2‰ reduction in δ^18O, which, in turn, would
   lead to lower volcanic CO[2] outgassing values ~6.0 Tmol C/year to be
   more appropriate for the early Pleistocene. As a consequence, modeled
   atmospheric CO[2] concentration would also be lower by ~30 ppm. We then
   constructed four different scenarios for the temporal evolution of
   volcanic CO[2] outgassing between 3 Ma ago and the present day. All
   scenarios consist of a long-term decrease from 6.2 Tmol C/year at 3 Ma
   ago to 5.3 Tmol C/year at present, but the timing and rate of the
   decrease vary between scenarios (Fig. 1C). A decrease from 6.2 to 5.3
   Tmol C/year corresponds to a decrease of less than 20%. Because even
   the value for the present-day volcanic outgassing is known with an
   uncertainty of more than 100% (~3 to 10 Tmol C/year) (28), changes in
   volcanic outgassing represent a possible candidate to explain the
   long-term CO[2] decrease. However, the aim of our study is not to
   explain the causes of the CO[2] decrease, and other processes such as
   changes in weathering (7) or organic carbon burial in deep-sea
   sediments (29) would also be potential candidates to explain the
   long-term CO[2] decline.

Optimal scenarios

   Using the splitting in time technique described above, we then
   performed transient model simulations driven by orbital forcing and
   each of the 16 possible combinations of regolith removal and volcanic
   CO[2] outgassing scenarios. We then selected the scenarios that gave
   the best fit, in terms of root mean square error and correlation,
   between modeled and observed δ^18O (Fig. 1D). This is equivalent to
   solving an inverse problem to derive plausible scenarios for the poorly
   constrained long-term CO[2] decrease and timing of regolith removal.

Abstract

   The dwarf planet Ceres is known to host a considerable amount of water
   in its interior, and areas of water ice were detected by the Dawn
   spacecraft on its surface. Moreover, sporadic water and hydroxyl
   emissions have been observed from space telescopes. We report the
   detection of water ice in a mid-latitude crater and its unexpected
   variation with time. The Dawn spectrometer data show a change of water
   ice signatures over a period of 6 months, which is well modeled as
   ~2-km^2 increase of water ice. The observed increase, coupled with
   Ceres’ orbital parameters, points to an ongoing process that seems
   correlated with solar flux. The reported variation on Ceres’ surface
   indicates that this body is chemically and physically active at the
   present time.

INTRODUCTION

   Ceres contains significant amounts of water (1), which is a key element
   of its evolution (2), composition (3), and activity (2). Water ice has
   been estimated to be ubiquitous and abundant within a few meters from
   the surface (4). Exposed water ice was also discovered by the Dawn
   mission in a few craters on Ceres situated in the northern hemisphere
   above 42° latitude, indicating a strong dependence of water ice
   stability with the surface illumination condition and temperatures (5,
   6). A notable exception is represented by Juling crater (Fig. 1A),
   being situated in a mid-latitude, in the southern hemisphere (35°S,
   168°E), where the Dawn visible and infrared (VIR) mapping spectrometer
   (7) detected water ice owing to the diagnostic absorption bands at
   1.25, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 μm (Fig. 1B). VIR detected ice on the northern
   shadowed crater wall, characterized by an almost vertical rocky cliff,
   illuminated by a secondary light source coming from the adjacent
   illuminated regions. The crater floor shows evidence of the flow of ice
   and rock, similar to Earth’s rock glacier (fig. S1) (8).

   Fig. 1 General context of the ice-rich area in Juling crater from
   Framing Camera and VIR spectrometer data.

   (A) Context Dawn Framing Camera image taken during L1 acquisition of
   the northern rim of Juling crater. The area in shadow is enhanced to
   show details of the ice-rich wall. (B) Measured spectra corresponding
   to positions in (A). Dotted lines represent spectra in the ranges
   corresponding to instrument filter junctions that could produce
   fictitious signals. The diagnostic absorption bands of water ice at
   1.25, 1.5, and 2.0 μm are visible. The broad absorption band of water
   ice at 3.0 μm is superimposed to the narrower absorption bands at 2.7,
   3.1, and 3.4 μm, which indicates the presence of Mg phyllosilicates,
   NH[4] phyllosilicates, and Mg carbonates (3), respectively. These
   minerals are ubiquitous on Ceres’ surface (3).

   This crater has been observed by VIR several times: two times with a
   nominal spatial resolution of ~100 m per pixel during the Low Altitude
   Mapping Orbit (L1 and L2) and three times with a nominal spatial
   resolution of ~400 m per pixel during a phase devoted to Juling’s
   observation: Extended Juling Orbit (E1, E2, and E3).

RESULTS

   Analyzing all the acquisitions, we discovered changes in the spectra of
   the ice-rich wall. Water bands were detected in all the observations on
   the northern wall of Juling but with a variation of the water ice
   features, in particular, the 2.0-μm water ice absorption (Fig. 2) that
   is the most prominent band and least affected by instrumental errors.

   Fig. 2 Measured average spectra and their band area at 2.0 μm from the
   ice-rich region.

   (A) Average spectra for each of the five observations from pixels in
   the rectangle of coordinates: latitude = [−35.0643, −34.7051] and
   longitude = [167.8362, 169.1599]. Spectral ranges corresponding to the
   instrument filter junctions are not shown. (B) Absorption band at 2.0
   μm normalized at 1.83 μm. (C) Band area measured as a function of Earth
   days by setting the day of the first observation (L1) equal to 0.

   However, the rim and wall were observed under different conditions in
   terms of (i) illumination and viewing geometry (table S1) and (ii)
   sampling and resolution. Because these conditions might affect the
   spectral shape, we accounted for them as follows:

   1) We noticed that illumination and viewing geometry can be considered
   equal in E1 and L1 (table S1), thus permitting a direct comparison of
   the measured spectra (Fig. 3). All the other observations have been
   compared by means of dedicated modeling, as discussed afterward.

   Fig. 3 Comparison of L1 and E1 observations in the ice-rich area and in
   a test area.

   (A) Average spectra of pixels in the rectangle (latitude = [35.0643,
   −34.7051]; longitude = [167.8362, 169.1599]) are used as a reference to
   compare the five observations. Two measured spectra from L1 and E1 can
   be directly compared due to the equal viewing geometry and illumination
   conditions. (B) The increase of water ice signatures and continuum
   level is clearly visible. Error bars include Poissonian noise and
   calibration uncertainty. (C) Comparison of average spectra from a test
   area (latitude = [−35.714045, −35.292928]; longitude = [168.6245,
   169.8397]) does not show any significant variation.

   2) The different spatial resolution and different sampling of the
   surface by the observations (fig. S2) are taken into account
   calculating an average spectrum, obtained over several pixels in the
   target area (see the Supplementary Materials). The selected area is
   defined by a rectangle of coordinates in latitude = [−35.0643,
   −34.7051] and longitude = [167.8362, 169.1599] (Fig. 3). The rectangle
   was chosen to be larger than the area containing the ice-rich wall, to
   include all pixels showing water ice signatures, considering the
   extension of the instrument point spread function (fig. S3). The
   resulting average spectra are shown in Fig. 2A.

   The spectra shown in Fig. 2 are affected by different illumination
   conditions and viewing geometry, and they cannot be compared directly
   to infer intrinsic water ice variation. However, these conditions are
   very similar for L1 and E1 observations, allowing a direct comparison.
   The direct comparison between L1 and E1 shows significant differences,
   with more pronounced ice spectral signatures in E1 (Figs. 2 and 3). We
   verified this approach by comparing the spectra of a test area without
   ice signatures. In this case, no significant variation in the spectra
   can be detected, ruling out any bias due to the different spatial
   resolution and sampling as well as illumination conditions (Fig. 3).

   The selected ice-rich area (Fig. 3) includes both the signal coming
   from the wall, indirectly illuminated by the light reflected by the
   crater floor, and the signal coming from a region outside the crater
   rim, directly illuminated by the Sun. By modeling the average spectra
   as the sum of the two contributions (fig. S4), we estimate the spectrum
   of the ice-rich wall and its band area at 2.0 μm for all observations

   Fig. 4 Modeled increase of water ice on the crater wall and
   contextualization along Ceres’ orbit.

   (A) Left axis: Band area at 2.0 μm calculated after isolation of the
   signal of the ice-rich wall by removal of the outer signal from average

   are estimated as discussed in the Supplementary Materials. au,
   astronomical unit. (B) Ceres orbit with International Ultraviolet
   Explorer (IUE) and Herschel water detections (12, 13). The orbit
   segment associated with the Juling observations indicates an increasing
   solar flux in the southern hemisphere of Ceres, where Juling is
   located.

   Intrinsic variations of the band area can be attributed to changing
   abundances of water ice, as well as other physical properties, such as
   changes in grain size. Using the model described in Materials and
   Methods, the spectra can be modeled by an areal mixture of regolith and
   water ice, and the observed variation of spectral signatures can be
   explained by an increasing abundance of water ice as a function of
   time, with an effective grain diameter fixed to 100 μm (see fig. S5).
   Best fits of the spectra are shown in fig. S6. As a further check,
   considering the information on the illumination condition and viewing
   geometry, we simulated the spectra of all observations assuming a
   constant ice abundance. The simulations show that a constant quantity
   of water ice is incompatible with the observations (fig. S7).

   According to the modeled spectra, the total area of the ice-rich wall
   results to be covered by 9.1 ± 0.3% of water ice in the first
   observation and by 13.7 ± 0.9% of water ice in the last observation
   (Fig. 4A and table S2). Using shape model analysis, we estimated the
   total surface of the wall to be ~40 km^2, from which we obtain an
   increase from 3.6 to 5.5 km^2 (±0.4 km^2) of the surface covered by
   water ice.

DISCUSSION

   The observed increasing abundance of water ice on the crater wall
   implies a change in temperature/pressure induced by (i) internal
   processes, (ii) exposure of ice present behind a regolith layer by
   falls, or (iii) solar input.

   i) One possible internal process would involve subsurface displacement
   of brine or liquid water, which, percolating through clay layers,
   freezes when exposed to the shadowed cold surface of the wall. The flow
   features on the crater floor would favor this hypothesis, but this
   scenario is difficult to reconcile with current evolution models of
   Ceres’ interior (2). Water in liquid or brine forms would imply either
   higher internal temperatures with respect to those foreseen for Ceres
   or much lower melting point (9). Nevertheless, subsurface brines have
   been suggested to explain the morphology and composition of the Occator
   central dome (9), and cryovolcanism has been indicated as the source of
   Ahuna Mons (10). Moreover, Ceres topography suggests the presence of
   liquid pore fluids in the uppermost mantle (11).

   ii) Another possibility is represented by falls exposing water ice. The
   monotonic trend (Fig. 4A) is not consistent with an exceptional event,
   such as a rock fall exposing water ice. However, a continuous erosion
   of the wall by regolith falls is possible, and it can justify the
   formation of the rock glaciers. In that case, the increase of ice on
   the wall can be explained by the exposure of pristine water ice, which
   does not sublimate with the same rate of its exposure during the season
   of the observations.

   iii) Other mechanisms would involve water vapor, which has been
   observed by Küppers et al. (12) and A’Hearn and Feldman (13). Water
   vapor might originate from the rock glaciers on the crater floor below
   a regolith layer, and the shadowed wall of the crater may be a cold
   trap for the water molecules. As long as the accumulation rate of water
   molecules is higher than the sublimation rate from the wall itself, the
   ice on the wall increases. Considering the derived 1.9-km^2 (±0.4 km^2)
   increase of ice cross section and assuming a grain diameter of 100 μm,
   we obtain an increase of the volume of water ice of 125 ± 25 m^3 in 6
   months. The equivalent average accumulation rate (net of sublimation)
   is 8.0 ± 1.6 g/s ( Embedded Image Embedded Image = 1 g/cm^3).

   It has been suggested that the observed water vapor (12) was triggered
   by solar radiation (12) and/or solar energetic particle events (14).
   The changes in heliocentric distance (Fig. 4 and table S1), coupled
   with the varying season (the subsolar point was moving toward lower
   latitudes), result in a net increase in solar flux and a retreat of
   shadow on the floor (fig. S8). We used a thermophysical model to
   simulate the water flux coming from the crater floor, triggered by
   solar radiation, at the epoch of Herschel observations (15, 16).
   Assuming that the crater floor is filled by water ice at ~1 cm below
   the surface, the estimated vapor flux coming from the crater is
   comparable to the total flux derived from Herschel observations (fig.
   S9). Moreover, Juling is located in proximity of the longitudinal
   coordinate, where the maximum emission was observed by Küppers et al.
   (12). However, we do not have constraints to derive the extension of
   the ice layer and the thickness of the superficial regolith layer.
   Thus, if water ice is confined below the thermal skin depth, then the
   solar radiation would not be sufficient to sublimate enough water
   vapor.

   Solar energetic protons have been indicated as possible sources of
   water vapor (14) because they could reach ice present in deeper
   subsurficial layers. Although these also might affect the surface ice
   at Juling, the event observed by Dawn (14) lasted about a day and the
   ensuing exosphere remained for a week. Hence, any lost water from
   Juling’s cold shadowed walls could be replenished.

   The linear relationship between ice abundance and solar flux (fig. S8)
   supports the possibility of solar flux as the main factor responsible
   for the observed increase. The water ice abundance on the wall is
   probably not constantly increasing over a longer time range. More
   likely, we are observing only part of a seasonal cycle of water
   sublimation and condensation, in which the observed increase should be
   followed by a decrease. Similar cycles of water ice have been observed
   for comet 67P/C-G (17–20) related to changes in heat flux.

   The orbital parameters of Ceres could justify such a cyclical trend
   (see Fig. 4B). After the period covered by the observations, Ceres
   approaches the summer solstice, close to perihelion, where the
   temperature of the shadowed area increases, possibly triggering also
   the sublimation of water ice previously accumulated on the cold wall or
   sublimating pristine water ice with higher rate than its exposure.

   The variation of superficial water ice occurring in the short time
   frame covered by these observations provides new scenarios for Ceres’
   evolution. It indicates an active body and reinforces not only the link
   with the icy solar system objects (3) but also the uniqueness of Ceres,
   given its present location in the main belt.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Non-intrinsic sources of spectral variability among different observations

   To correctly compare the average spectra measured for the five
   observations of the ice-rich wall of Juling crater, we should take into
   account the non-intrinsic sources of spectral variability due to
   different conditions of observation:

   1) Poissonian noise, which produces spurious spectral variability among
   different measured spectra. This noise is less significant for average
   spectra obtained by a large number of measurements. It minimizes the
   noise for the average spectra analyzed in the present work because the
   average spectra are derived from tens or hundreds of pixels (table S1).

   2) Different spatial resolutions among the five observations analyzed
   in this work may introduce a bias when the spectra are compared: in
   particular, the higher the resolution, the more sensitive would be the
   measurement of the finest detail, which could not be resolved in
   lower-resolution observations. To address this issue, we only compared
   average spectra coming from the whole area of interest, covered by tens
   or hundreds of pixels, which is spatially resolved for all
   observations.

   3) Although the area of interest is covered by these observations, the
   footprints of the spectrometer slit are not contiguous (fig. S2); thus,
   each point on the surface can be sampled in differing degrees of detail
   by the instrument, according to the position of the closest pixel
   footprint. This sampling heterogeneity introduces a further source of
   uncertainty. However, ~50% of the area of interest is covered by
   considering the pixel footprint only (fig. S2), and nearly 100% by
   considering the spatial extension of the point spread function of the
   instrument (fig. S3). Thus, the measured average signal should be
   representative, within the margin of error, of the whole area of
   interest, regardless of the extent of sampling of a particular area.
   This is confirmed by the same average signal of the test area shown in
   Fig. 3.

   To evaluate the above-mentioned uncertainties, we simulated different
   spatial samplings and assessed the induced variability of the derived
   parameters. We used the following approaches: (i) random weights in the
   0 to 2 range have been assigned to all pixels in the area of interest;
   (ii) a weighted average spectrum is calculated from the pixels with
   their assigned weights; (iii) the targeted spectral parameter is
   calculated from the average spectrum; (iv) the previous three points
   are repeated many times, starting from different random weights and
   thus obtaining a distribution of values of the targeted parameter; and
   (v) the error associated for each derived parameter is the SD of the
   corresponding distribution. The error bars of Figs. 2C and 4A are
   calculated in this way.Using this approach, we assigned a relative
   uncertainty of 100% for each pixel, simulating all the intermediate
   possibilities between the case in which a pixel is not detected and the
   case in which it is detected twice. This uncertainty propagates an
   error on the spectral parameter derived from the average spectrum,
   which is estimated by the approach discussed here.

   4) In each observation, the total surface of the ice-rich wall can have
   a different projection of the corresponding area along the line of
   sight, according to the spacecraft position at the moment of
   observation. A different contribution between the area of the ice-rich
   wall and the area of outer regions (devoid of water ice), in the
   resulting average spectra, produces a fictitious variation of the
   spectral features. As an example of this effect, we observed an
   apparent smaller band area at 2.0 μm in L2, with respect to L1. To
   account for this issue, and to derive intrinsic spectral parameters of
   water ice in the ice-rich wall, a dedicated model has been implemented,
   as discussed in the “Spectral modeling” section.

Band area

   The band area at 2.0 μm, reported in Figs. 2C and 4A, fig. S7, and
   table S2, is defined as Embedded Image Embedded Image where a and b are
   the edges of the bands: 1.83 to 2.24 μm. The continuum used to
   characterize the bands is calculated with a linear fit between a and b.
   The band area as defined above is expressed in micrometers. Error bars
   are estimated as discussed above.

Spectral modeling

   The measured signal inside the region of interest defined in the main
   text is the sum of the radiance coming from the illuminated outer
   region (without ice) (OR) (Eq. 1) and the one coming from the ice-rich
   wall (IRW) in shadow, but illuminated by the light reflected by the
   crater itself (Eq. 2). The nearly vertical wall in shadow is
   illuminated from all directions within the solid angle subtended by the
   crater as seen by the wall (~π steradians). To model the light
   scattered from the crater floor toward the shadowed wall, and the
   secondary scattered light from the latter toward the detector, we take
   into account the bi-hemispherical reflectance (21). Higher orders of
   scattering are assumed to be negligible.

   The regolith of the ice-rich wall (Eq. 2) is modeled by an aerial
   mixture of water ice (WI) [optical constants by Warren (22), Mastrapa
   et al. (23), and Clark et al. (24)] and Ceres’ average terrain (CAT)
   with optical properties as defined by Ciarniello et al. (25).

   Using spectral modeling, we derived grain size of water ice of the
   order of 100 μm for all observations. This value is thus kept fixed in
   the fitting procedure discussed here. Embedded Image Embedded Image
   (1)where Rad[OR] is the radiance of the outer regions; J is the solar
   irradiance; r[R_OR] is the bidirectional reflectance (21) of Ceres’
   average terrain, with photometric parameters as defined by Ciarniello
   et al. (25), and viewing geometry by shape model analysis and
   spacecraft position at the moment of the observations (table S1); and f
   = (1 + b*(λ − λ[0]) + c*(λ − λ[0])^4) is the correction factor for the
   continuum slope, with b and c being constants derived in the fitting
   procedure, and λ[0] = 3.0 μm. This term accounts for the variation of
   the continuum slope due to spurious instrumental effects in
   correspondence with spatial signal contrast, such as shadowed regions.
   A similar approach is discussed by Ciarniello et al. (19). The models
   performed with and without this correction factor are shown in fig. S4.
   Embedded Image Embedded Image (2)where Rad[IRW] is the radiance of the
   ice-rich wall; r[s_CAT] is the bi-hemispherical reflectance (21) of
   Ceres’ average terrain; <μ[0]> is the average incidence angle cosine on
   the crater at the time of the observation, derived by shape model
   analysis; (r[s_CAT] <μ[0]>/π) represents the reflectance of a
   Lambertian surface, with Lambert albedo equal to r[s_CAT] (20); the
   factor 2 in the denominator accounts for the fact that one-half of the
   whole solid angle seen by the ice-rich wall is covered by the crater
   itself; r[s_WI] is the bi-hemispherical reflectance (21) of water ice;
   and p[WI] is the cross section of water ice as a fraction of the total
   projected area of the ice-rich wall (in the main text, we refer to this
   quantity as water ice abundance) Embedded Image Embedded Image (3)where
   Refl[average] is the average reflectance; p[IRW] is the cross section
   of the ice-rich wall as a fraction of the total projected area of
   interest; and p[OR] = (1 − p[IRW]) is the cross section of the outer
   regions as a fraction of the total projected area of interest.

   Using a least-square optimization algorithm, we performed a model of
   Refl[average] (Eq. 3) by fitting the measured reflectance, similar to
   that of Raponi et al. (20). Photometric correction of measured data is
   not required, because photometric parameters are included in the model
   as specified above.

   As a result, we retrieved p[IRW] and p[WI] unambiguously. Spectral
   modeling was performed in the 1.15- to 3.55-μm interval to avoid the
   spectral range affected by thermal emission. Models are shown in fig.
   S5.

   Carlos Nobre

   In the 1970s, Brazilian scientist Eneas Salati shattered the long held
   dogma that vegetation is simply the consequence of climate and has no
   influence on climate whatsoever (1). Using isotopic ratios of oxygen in
   rainwater samples collected from the Atlantic to the Peruvian border,
   he was able to demonstrate unequivocally that the Amazon generates
   approximately half of its own rainfall by recycling moisture 5 to 6
   times as airmasses move from the Atlantic across the basin to the west.

   From the start, the demonstration of the hydrological cycle of the
   Amazon raised the question of how much deforestation would be required
   to cause the cycle to degrade to the point of being unable to support
   rain forest ecosystems.

   High levels of evaporation and transpiration that forests produce
   throughout the year contribute to a wetter atmospheric boundary layer
   than would be the case with non-forest.This surface-atmosphere coupling
   is more important where large-scale factors for rainfall formation are
   weaker, such as in central and eastern Amazonia. Near the Andes, the
   impact of at least modest deforestation is less dramatic because the
   general ascending motion of airmasses in this area induces high levels
   of rainfall in addition to that expected from local evaporation and
   transpiration.

   Where might the tipping point be for deforestation-generated
   degradation of the hydrological cycle? The very first model to examine
   this question (2) showed that at about 40% deforestation, central,
   southern and eastern Amazonia would experience diminished rainfall and
   a lengthier dry season, predicting a shift to savanna vegetation to the
   east.

   Moisture from the Amazon is important to rainfall and human wellbeing
   because it contributes to winter rainfall for parts of the La Plata
   basin, especially southern Paraguay, southern Brazil, Uruguay and
   central-eastern Argentina; in other regions, the moisture passes over
   the area, but does not precipitate out. Although the amount
   contributing to rainfall in southeastern Brazil is smaller than in
   other areas, even small amounts can be a welcome addition to urban
   reservoirs.

   The importance of Amazon moisture for Brazilian agriculture south of
   the Amazon is complex but not trivial. Perhaps most important is the
   partial contribution of dry season Amazon evapotranspiration to
   rainfall in southeastern South America. Forests maintain an
   evapotranspiration rate year-round, whereas evapotranspiration in
   pastures is dramatically lower in the dry season. As a consequence,
   models suggest a longer dry season after deforestation.

   In recent decades, new forcing factors have impinged on the
   hydrological cycle: climate change and widespread use of fire to
   eliminate felled trees and clear weedy vegetation. Many studies show
   that in the absence of other contributing factors, 4° Celsius of global
   warming would be the tipping point to degraded savannas in most of the
   central, southern, and eastern Amazon. Widespread use of fire leads to
   drying of surrounding forest and greater vulnerability to fire in the
   subsequent year.

   We believe that negative synergies between deforestation, climate
   change, and widespread use of fire indicate a tipping point for the
   Amazon system to flip to non-forest ecosystems in eastern, southern and
   central Amazonia at 20-25% deforestation.

   The severity of the droughts of 2005, 2010 and 2015-16 could well
   represent the first flickers of this ecological tipping point. These
   events, together with the severe floods of 2009, 2012 (and 2014 over SW
   Amazonia), suggest that the whole system is oscillating. For the last
   two decades the dry season over the southern and eastern Amazon has
   been increasing. Large scale factors such as warmer sea surface
   temperatures over the tropical North Atlantic also seem to be
   associated with the changes on land.

   We believe that the sensible course is not only to strictly curb
   further deforestation, but also to build back a margin of safety
   against the Amazon tipping point, by reducing the deforested area to
   less than 20%, for the commonsense reason that there is no point in
   discovering the precise tipping point by tipping it. At the 2015 Paris
   Conference of the Parties, Brazil committed to 12 million ha of
   reforestation by 2030. Much or most of this reforestation should be in
   southern and eastern Amazonia. The hydrological cycle of the Amazon is
   fundamental to human well-being in Brazil and adjacent South America.

Abstract

   Limiting climate warming to <2°C requires increased mitigation efforts,
   including land stewardship, whose potential in the United States is
   poorly understood. We quantified the potential of natural climate
   solutions (NCS)—21 conservation, restoration, and improved land
   management interventions on natural and agricultural lands—to increase
   carbon storage and avoid greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
   We found a maximum potential of 1.2 (0.9 to 1.6) Pg CO[2]e year^−1, the
   equivalent of 21% of current net annual emissions of the United States.
   At current carbon market prices (USD 10 per Mg CO[2]e), 299 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1 could be achieved. NCS would also provide air and water
   filtration, flood control, soil health, wildlife habitat, and climate
   resilience benefits.

INTRODUCTION

   Limiting global warming below the 2°C threshold set by the Paris
   Climate Agreement is contingent upon both reducing emissions and
   removing greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the atmosphere (1, 2). Natural
   climate solutions (NCS), a portfolio of discrete land stewardship
   options (3), are the most mature approaches available for carbon
   conservation and uptake compared to nascent carbon capture technologies
   (4) and could complement increases in zero-carbon energy production and
   energy efficiency to achieve needed climate change mitigation. Within
   the United States, the maximum and economically viable mitigation
   potentials from NCS are unclear.

   Here, we quantify the maximum potential for NCS in the United States
   and the portion of this maximum that could be achieved at several price
   points. We consider 21 distinct NCS to provide a consistent and
   comprehensive exploration of the mitigation potential of conservation,
   restoration, and improved management in forests, grasslands,
   agricultural lands, and wetlands (Fig. 1), carefully defined to avoid
   double counting (details in the Supplementary Materials). We estimate
   the potential for NCS in the year 2025, which is the target year for
   the United States’ Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the
   Paris Agreement to reduce GHG emissions by 26 to 28% from 2005 levels.
   Our work refines a coarser-resolution global analysis (3) and updates
   and expands the range of options considered in previous analyses for
   the United States (5–8).

   Fig. 1 Climate mitigation potential of 21 NCS in the United States.

   Black lines indicate the 95% CI or reported range (see table S1).
   Ecosystem service benefits linked with each NCS are indicated by
   colored bars for air (filtration), biodiversity (habitat protection or
   restoration), soil (enrichment), and water (filtration and flood
   control). See the Supplementary Materials for detailed findings and
   sources.

   For each NCS opportunity (Fig. 1 and the Supplementary Materials), we
   estimate the maximum mitigation potential of GHGs measured in CO[2]
   equivalents (CO[2]e), given the below constraints. We then estimate the
   reductions obtainable for less than USD 10, 50, and 100 per Mg CO[2]e.
   Current carbon markets pay around USD 10 (9). The social cost of carbon
   in 2025 is approximately USD 50, using a 3% discount rate (10).
   However, a price of at least USD 100 is thought to be needed to keep
   the 100-year average temperature from warming more than 2.5°C (11), and
   an even higher price may be needed to meet the Paris Agreement <2°C
   target. Many NCS also generate co-benefits, which, even without a price
   on carbon, provide incentives to invest in NCS implementation. We
   identified co-benefits generated by each NCS in four categories of
   ecosystem services: air, biodiversity, water, and soil (Fig. 1 and
   table S2).

   To avoid conflicts with other important societal goals for land use, we
   constrain our maximum estimate to be compatible with human needs for
   food and fiber (Supplementary Materials). Within these constraints, 5.1
   Mha of cropland can be restored to grasslands, forests, and wetlands,
   equal to the area that has left the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
   since 2007 (8) and less than half the land currently dedicated to corn
   ethanol. We also estimate that 1.3 Mha of pasture could be reforested
   without affecting livestock production, assuming recent improvements in
   efficiency continue (see the Supplementary Materials). We assume that
   timber production can temporarily decrease by 10%, which maintains
   timber production levels within the historic range of variation and
   enables managed forests and plantations to transition to longer harvest
   rotations (see the Supplementary Materials). We assume that extensive
   natural forests on private lands can all undergo harvest extension,
   with the temporary loss of timber supply replaced by reforestation and
   thinning for fire risk reduction (12) or with thinning or select
   harvest practices that still provide timber but maintain carbon levels
   (Supplementary Materials) (13, 14). We further constrain our analysis
   to avoid impacts on biodiversity. This biodiversity constraint
   precludes both the conversion of natural habitat to energy crops and
   the afforestation of native grasslands.

RESULTS

   We find a maximum additional NCS mitigation potential of 1.2 Pg CO[2]e
   year^−1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9 to 1.6 Pg CO[2]e year^−1] in
   the year 2025 (Fig. 1 and table S1). This is 21% of the 5794.5 Tg
   CO[2]e of net emissions in 2016 (15). The majority (63%) of this
   potential comes from increased carbon sequestration in plant biomass,
   with 29% coming from increased carbon sequestration in soil and 7%
   coming from avoided emissions of CH[4] and N[2]O. At the USD 10, 50,
   and 100 price points, 25, 76, and 91%, respectively, of the maximum
   mitigation would be achieved. This means that 1.1 Pg CO[2]e year^−1 are
   available at USD 100 per Mg CO[2]e, which equals the emission
   reductions needed to meet the U.S. NDC under the Paris Agreement (see
   the Supplementary Materials). If NCS were pursued in combination with
   additional mitigation in the energy sector, then it would therefore
   enable the United States to exceed its current NDC ambition. This is
   important because, globally, current NDCs (7 to 9 Pg CO[2]e year^−1)
   would need to be dramatically increased (by an additional 10 to 16 Pg
   CO[2]e year^−1) to limit warming below 2°C (16).

   This estimate of maximum NCS potential is similar to or higher than
   several previous syntheses of mitigation opportunities in the land
   sector. For example, the United States Mid-Century Strategy for Deep
   Decarbonization estimated a potential land sink of 912 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1, 30% lower than our estimate (5). While other efforts have
   focused on the forest sector (7) or the agricultural sector (6), this
   analysis presents a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of NCS
   opportunities in the United States. For example, this analysis
   considers potential additional mitigation from tidal wetlands and
   seagrass (“blue carbon”), which has been comprehensively analyzed for
   its current status in the United States (17), but not its potential for
   additional mitigation.

   Reforestation has the single largest maximum mitigation potential (307
   Tg CO[2]e year^−1). The majority of this potential occurs in the
   northeast (35%) and south central (31%) areas of the United States
   (fig. S1). This mitigation potential increases to 381 Tg CO[2]e year^−1
   if all pastures in historically forested areas are reforested. Previous
   estimates of reforestation potential range widely from 208 to 1290 Tg
   CO[2]e year^−1 (7). Higher estimates than ours can be obtained by
   reforesting or afforesting areas that we excluded (e.g., productive
   crop and pasture lands and natural grasslands) and/or by using rates of
   carbon sequestration from plantation systems rather than from natural
   regenerating forests [e.g., (7)].

   Natural forest management of privately held forests has the second
   largest maximum mitigation potential (267 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). This
   maximum mitigation is achieved by extending harvest cycles. Mitigation
   can also be achieved through forest management practices such as
   reduced impact logging and improved silvicultural practices that
   release suppressed forest growth (18–20), although often at lower
   sequestration rates than extending harvest cycles. These management
   practices can be implemented at low or no net cost (21, 22) and do not
   require a change in business-as-usual (BAU) land use or ownership
   rights.

   Another promising opportunity associated with forests is fire
   management (18 Tg CO[2]e year^−1; fig. S6). Fire management entails
   restoring frequent, low-intensity, understory fires in fire-prone
   forest ecosystems to reduce the potential for high-severity wildfires
   (23). The primary carbon benefit from fire management is avoiding
   decreased net ecosystem production from tree-killing wildfire. In the
   absence of improved fire management, climate change is expected to
   continue to increase the frequency of high-severity fires and
   compromise the ability of forests to regenerate following these fires
   (24). The high uncertainty associated with the climate mitigation
   benefits of fire management would be reduced by additional research to
   quantify the carbon storage benefits of prescribed fire across a
   diversity of forest types, including the length of time that prescribed
   fire reduces the risk of subsequent high-severity fires.

   Avoided conversion protects carbon stored in extant forests and
   grasslands from ongoing losses. More than two-thirds of the avoided
   forest conversion potential (38 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) occurs in the
   Southern and Pacific Northwest regions (table S14 and fig. S9). Many of
   the most intensive areas of rapid forest conversion were located near
   urban zones, with additional hot spots in recent agricultural expansion
   zones (such as California’s Central Valley) and semi-arid regions of
   the West. Avoided conversion of grassland to cropland prevents
   emissions from soils and root biomass (107 Tg CO[2]e year^−1; fig.
   S12). The emissions from grassland conversion exceed the emissions from
   forest conversion because both the rate of conversion and the per
   hectare emissions are higher (table S1). Cropland expansion is a major
   cause of conversion that affects grasslands much more than forests
   (25). The higher rate of emissions occurs because the conversion of
   grasslands to croplands results in a 28% loss of soil carbon from the
   top meter of soil (26). This generates 125 Mg CO[2]e ha^−1 in
   emissions, comprising 81% of the emissions from grassland conversion
   (see the Supplementary Materials). Because research shows conflicting
   conclusions regarding the impact of forest conversion in the United
   States on soil carbon, we do not include the soil carbon pool in our
   estimate of emissions from forest conversion (see the Supplementary
   Materials).

   Carbon sequestration opportunities in croplands include the use of
   cover crops and improved cropland nutrient management. Cover crops,
   grown when fields are normally bare, provide additional carbon inputs
   to soils. Growing cover crops on the 88 Mha of the five primary crops
   in United States not already using cover crops presents a substantial
   opportunity for mitigation (103 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). Cover crops are
   increasingly used by U.S. farmers to improve soil health, yields, and
   yield consistency (27). Improved management of nitrogen fertilizers
   reduces N[2]O emissions and avoids fossil fuel emissions associated
   with fertilizer production (52 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). Fertilizer rates can
   be reduced while maintaining yields by using precision agriculture to
   apply only the amount required in each part of the field and by
   splitting fertilizer applications to match the timing and supply of
   fertilizer with crop demand (see the Supplementary Materials).
   Emissions can also be reduced by switching from anhydrous fertilizer to
   urea, which has lower N[2]O emission (6).

   The agronomic practices of biochar incorporation (95 Tg CO[2]e year^−1)
   and alley cropping (planting widely spaced trees interspersed with a
   row crop; 82 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) also have high maximum potential.
   However, current adoption is negligible due to a variety of cultural,
   technological, and cost barriers that would need to be overcome if
   these practices were to achieve their mitigation potential (28, 29).

   Tidal wetland restoration is the largest wetland NCS (12 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1). Roughly 27% of U.S. salt marshes are disconnected from the
   ocean and subject to freshwater inundation. This results in a large
   increase in CH[4] emissions from these “freshened” salt marshes.
   Reconnecting salt marshes with the ocean, such as via culverts under
   roads or other barriers, can avoid these CH[4] emissions (30).

   The 10 opportunities described above account for 90% (1082 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1) of the maximum NCS mitigation potential across all 21
   opportunities. An additional 11 opportunities, which sum to 122 Tg
   CO[2]e year^−1, account for just 10% of the maximum potential. However,
   these NCS may offer optimal ecological and economic opportunities at
   local scales (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Materials). For example,
   peatland restoration offers a high per hectare mitigation benefit,
   especially in regions of the United States with warm temperate climates
   (8.2 Mg CO[2]e ha^−1 year^−1).

   Lower-cost opportunities represent particularly promising areas for
   increased near-term investment. We identified 299 Tg CO[2]e year^−1 of
   NCS opportunities that could be realized for USD 10 Mg CO[2]e^−1 or
   less (table S1), a price that is in line with many current carbon
   markets (9). The two largest lower-cost opportunities are improved
   management practices: cover crops (100 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) and improved
   natural forest management (64 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). Both of these
   practices, along with planting windbreaks (5 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) and
   legumes in pastures (3 Tg CO[2]e year^−1), have the potential to
   increase yields (21, 22, 27) and therefore to generate additional
   revenue for landowners. Improved manure management can also provide
   low-cost mitigation (12 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) (8). In addition, lower-cost
   NCS include increased efficiencies (cropland nutrient management, 28 Tg
   CO[2]e year^−1; grazing optimization, 6 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) and avoided
   conversion (avoided forest conversion, 37 Tg CO[2]e year^−1; avoided
   grassland conversion, 24 Tg CO[2]e year^−1).

   By itself, the marginal abatement cost gives an incomplete picture of
   the potential for implementation of NCS, in part because NCS provide a
   variety of co-benefits (Fig. 1 and table S2). The values of these
   co-benefits are not captured in our marginal abatement costs yet may
   drive NCS implementation. For example, investments in fire management
   are needed to avoid impacts on air quality and drinking water
   provision; urban forestry provides human health, aesthetic, and direct
   temperature reduction benefits; nutrient management is needed to
   improve water quality and avoid toxic algal blooms (table S2). Further,
   NCS can help provide resilience to climate change impacts on nature and
   people. For example, building soil carbon increases the resilience of
   cropland (31); protecting coastal wetlands can provide coastal defense
   against storms (32); and fire management can help avoid damaging
   wildfires (23).

   We have restricted our analysis to those opportunities where the
   literature conclusively demonstrates the potential for mitigation. This
   suggests that new research may reveal additional opportunities for NCS,
   which would increase the potential identified here. At the same time,
   substantial uncertainties exist in some NCS opportunities (Fig. 1 and
   table S1), highlighting the need for implementation to be coupled with
   monitoring and assessment of NCS.

DISCUSSION

   The United States is the largest cumulative emitter of carbon dioxide
   from fossil fuels (33). Despite the immense size of U.S. GHG emissions
   from fossil fuel use, we find that NCS have the potential to generate
   mitigation equivalent to 21% of net annual emissions. This reveals the
   important contribution to climate mitigation that the land sector can
   make, even in developed countries such as the United States.

   Globally, current NCS efforts receive only 0.8% of public and private
   climate financing (34), despite offering roughly 37% of potential
   mitigation needed through 2030 (3). One concern that may have limited
   the adoption of NCS to date includes competition with other land uses
   such as food and bioenergy production. A growing body of literature
   suggests that future global food demand can be met via investments in
   yield increases, closing yield gaps, diet shifts, aquaculture, and
   biofuel policy, without the need to further expand cropland into
   natural areas (35, 36). In the United States, marginal cropland, much
   of which is unprofitable (37), could be restored to grassland or
   forests with net societal benefits (38). Similarly, NCS may compete
   with bioenergy production. However, this conflict can be reduced or
   avoided depending on the form of bioenergy production or NCS. Some
   forms of biomass production, such as residues and wastes, or
   high-yielding methods, such as algae, do not require productive land
   (39). Our grassland restoration pathway could produce a limited amount
   of additional biomass while maintaining carbon sequestration in soils
   if low-productivity croplands are converted to perennial energy grasses
   (40). Further, NCS based on improved management of existing land uses
   do not create land use conflict and can even increase productivity
   within that land use (e.g., fire management or cover crops). However,
   aggressive expansion of dedicated bioenergy crops, given the large land
   requirement of both first- and second-generation bioenergy crops (41),
   would be likely to reduce the mitigation potential available through
   NCS, notably via reforestation, avoided grassland conversion, and
   natural forest management.

   A second concern is that ecosystems have a limited ability to store
   additional carbon. For each pathway, we quantified the duration of time
   for which mitigation is expected to occur at the rates we estimate,
   before saturation effects decrease this rate (table S1). We note that
   carbon can continue to accumulate in forests for hundreds of years and
   in soils for centuries or millennia (table S1 and the Supplementary
   Materials). Further, four of our NCS opportunities (cropland nutrient
   management, tidal wetland restoration, manure management, and improved
   rice management) are based on avoided emissions of CH[4] and N[2]O,
   which are benefits that do not saturate. The mitigation potential of
   avoided conversion of habitat is limited by the total carbon contained
   in the habitat. Our analysis assumes that rates of conversion persist
   at current levels in a BAU scenario, which would represent a continuing
   source of emissions for at least 67 years for each habitat considered
   here before reaching “saturation” when the total area has been lost.
   However, the long-term benefit of avoided conversion depends on assumed
   future BAU conversion rates.

   The permanence of the ~2270 Pg C currently stored globally in biomass
   (42) and soils to 1 m (26) is a significant concern, because
   unmitigated climate change is likely to cause feedbacks that may
   increase disturbances such as fire or pest outbreaks (43) or limit net
   ecosystem productivity or forest regeneration (24). While NCS would
   marginally increase this large carbon pool, putting some additional
   carbon at risk, rapid and widespread implementation of NCS would reduce
   the overall risk of impermanence to the terrestrial biosphere that
   unmitigated climate change is likely to cause.

   Another challenge is that avoiding conversion in one area can cause
   conversion to shift to other areas, often referred to as “leakage.”
   Large-scale sectoral and landscape approaches to land use planning and
   policies will be needed to realize the NCS opportunities identified
   here. These approaches can and should be designed to buffer risks of
   leakage associated with individual projects (44).

   Reducing carbon-intensive energy consumption is necessary but
   insufficient to meet the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement.
   Comprehensive mitigation efforts that include fossil fuel emission
   reductions coupled with NCS hold promise for keeping warming below 2°C.
   Beyond providing meaningful climate mitigation, NCS investment can
   increase other important ecosystem services. The conservation,
   restoration, and improved management of lands in the United States
   represent a necessary and urgent component of efforts to stabilize the
   climate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

   Below, we provide a brief overview of methods for each of the 21 NCS
   that we quantified. Full methodological details are provided in the
   Supplementary Materials.

   Reforestation: Additional carbon sequestration in above- and
   belowground biomass and soils gained by converting nonforest (<25% tree
   cover) to forest [>25% tree cover (45)] in areas of the conterminous
   United States where forests are the native cover type. We excluded
   areas with intensive human development, including all major roads (46),
   impervious surfaces (47), and urban areas (48). To eliminate double
   counting with the peatland restoration pathway, we removed Histosol
   soils (49). To safeguard food production, we removed most cropland and
   pasture. We discounted the carbon sequestration mitigation benefit in
   conifer-dominated forests to account for albedo effects.

   Natural forest management: Additional carbon sequestration in above-
   and belowground biomass gained through improved management in forests
   on private lands under nonintensive timber management. The maximum
   mitigation potential was quantified on the basis of a “harvest hiatus”
   scenario starting in 2025, in which natural forests are shifted to
   longer harvest rotations. This could be accomplished with less than 10%
   reduction in timber supply with new timber supply from thinning
   treatments for fuel risk reduction until new timber from reforestation
   is available in 2030.

   Fire management: Use of prescribed fire to reduce the risk of
   high-intensity wildfire. We considered fire-prone forests in the
   western United States. We assume that treatment eliminates the risk of
   subsequent wildfire for 20 years, but only on the land that was
   directly treated. We assume that 5% of lands are treated each year, and
   we calculated the benefits that accrue over 20 years, finding that the
   initial increase in emissions associated with prescribed fire treatment
   is more than offset over time by the avoided impacts of wildfires. We
   report the average annual benefit across these 20 years. The impact of
   wildfires includes both direct emissions from combustion and
   suppression of net ecosystem productivity following wildfires.

   Avoided forest conversion: Emissions of CO[2] avoided by avoiding
   anthropogenic forest conversion. Most forest clearing is followed by
   forest regeneration rather than conversion to another land use. To
   estimate the rate of persistent conversion (i.e., to another land use),
   we first calculated forest clearing in the conterminous United States
   from 2000 to 2010 and then used the proportion of forest clearing that
   historically was converted to another land use to estimate conversion
   rates in 2000 to 2010. We used estimates of avoided carbon emissions
   from above- and belowground biomass that are specific to each region
   and forest type. We did not count forest loss due to fire to avoid
   double counting with the improved fire management opportunity. We did
   not count forest loss due to pests because it is unclear whether this
   loss can be avoided. We reduced the benefit of avoided conversion in
   conifer-dominated forests to account for their albedo effects.

   Urban reforestation: Additional carbon sequestration in above- and
   belowground biomass gained by increasing urban tree cover. We
   considered the potential to increase urban tree cover in 3535 cities in
   the conterminous United States. We considered the potential for
   additional street trees, and for those cities not in deserts, we also
   considered the potential for park and yard tree plantings. The
   potential percent increase in tree cover was estimated on the basis of
   high-resolution analysis of 27 cities, which excluded sports fields,
   golf courses, and lawns (50).

   Improved plantations: Additional carbon sequestration gained in above-
   and belowground tree biomass by extending rotation lengths for a
   limited time in even-aged, intensively managed wood production forests.
   Rotation lengths were extended from current economic optimal rotation
   length to a biological optimal rotation length in which harvest occurs
   when stands reach their maximum annual growth.

   Cover crops: Additional soil carbon sequestration gained by growing a
   cover crop in the fallow season between main crops. We quantified the
   benefit of using cover crops on all of the five major crops in the
   United States (corn, soy, wheat, rice, and cotton) that are not already
   growing cover crops (27), using the mean sequestration rate quantified
   in a recent meta-analysis (51).

   Avoided conversion of grassland: Emissions of CO[2] avoided by avoiding
   conversion of grassland and shrubland to cropland. We quantified
   avoided emissions from soil and roots (for shrubs, we also considered
   aboveground biomass) based on the spatial pattern of conversion from
   2008 to 2012. We used spatial information on location of recent
   conversion and variation in soil carbon and root biomass to estimate
   mean annual emission rate from historic conversion. We estimated a 28%
   loss of soil carbon down to 1 m (26). We modeled spatial variation in
   root biomass based on mean annual temperature and mean annual
   precipitation using data from (52).

   Biochar: Increased soil carbon sequestration by amending agricultural
   soils with biochar, which converts nonrecalcitrant carbon (crop residue
   biomass) to recalcitrant carbon (charcoal) through pyrolysis. We
   limited the source of biochar production to crop residue that can be
   sustainably harvested. We assumed that 79.6% of biochar carbon persists
   on a time scale of >100 years (53, 54) and that there are no effects of
   biochar on emissions of N[2]O or CH[4] (55, 56).

   Alley cropping: Additional carbon sequestration gained by planting wide
   rows of trees with a companion crop grown in the alleyways between the
   rows. We estimated a maximum potential of alley cropping on 10% of U.S.
   cropland (15.4 Mha) (57).

   Cropland nutrient management: Avoided N[2]O emissions due to more
   efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers and avoided upstream emissions
   from fertilizer manufacture. We considered four improved management
   practices: (i) reduced whole-field application rate, (ii) switching
   from anhydrous ammonia to urea, (iii) improved timing of fertilizer
   application, and (iv) variable application rate within field. We
   projected a 4.6% BAU growth in fertilizer use in the United States by
   2025. On the basis of these four practices, we found a maximum
   potential of 22% reduction in nitrogen use, which leads to a 33%
   reduction in field emissions and a 29% reduction including upstream
   emissions.

   Improved manure management: Avoided CH[4] emissions from dairy and hog
   manure. We estimated the potential for emission reductions from
   improved manure management on dairy farms with over 300 cows and hog
   farms with over 825 hogs. Our calculations are based on improved
   management practices described by Pape et al. (8).

   Windbreaks: Additional sequestration in above- and belowground biomass
   and soils from planting windbreaks adjacent to croplands that would
   benefit from reduced wind erosion. We estimated that windbreaks could
   be planted on 0.88 Mha, based on an estimated 17.6 Mha that would
   benefit from windbreaks, and that windbreaks would be planted on ~5% of
   that cropland (8).

   Grazing optimization: Additional soil carbon sequestration due to
   grazing optimization on rangeland and planted pastures, derived
   directly from a recent study by Henderson et al. (58). Grazing
   optimization prescribes a decrease in stocking rates in areas that are
   overgrazed and an increase in stocking rates in areas that are
   undergrazed, but with the net result of increased forage offtake and
   livestock production.

   Grassland restoration: Additional carbon sequestration in soils and
   root biomass gained by restoring 2.1 Mha of cropland to grassland,
   equivalent to returning to the 2007 peak in CRP enrollment. Grassland
   restoration does not include restoration of shrubland.

   Legumes in pastures: Additional soil carbon sequestration due to sowing
   legumes in planted pastures, derived directly from a recent global
   study by Henderson et al. (58). Restricted to planted pastures and to
   where sowing legumes would result in net sequestration after taking
   into account potential increases in N[2]O emissions from the planted
   legumes.

   Improved rice management: Avoided emissions of CH[4] and N[2]O through
   improved practices in flooded rice cultivation. Practices including
   mid-season drainage, alternate wetting and drying, and residue removal
   can reduce these emissions. We used a U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) analysis that projects the potential for improvement
   across U.S. rice fields, in comparison with current agricultural
   practices (59).

   Tidal wetland restoration: In the United States, 27% of tidal wetlands
   (salt marshes and mangroves) have limited tidal connection with the
   sea, causing their salinity to decline to the point where CH[4]
   emissions increase (30). We estimated the potential for reconnecting
   these tidal wetlands to the ocean to increase salinity and reduce CH[4]
   emissions.

   Peatland restoration: Avoided carbon emissions from rewetting and
   restoring drained peatlands. To estimate the extent of restorable
   peatlands, we quantified the difference between historic peatland
   extent [based on the extent of Histosols in soil maps (60)] and current
   peatland extent. Our estimate of mitigation potential accounted for
   changes in soil carbon, biomass, and CH[4] emissions, considering
   regional differences, the type of land use of the converted peatland,
   and whether the peatland was originally forested.

   Avoided seagrass loss: Avoided CO[2] emissions from avoiding seagrass
   loss. An estimated 1.5% of seagrass extent is lost every year (61). We
   assumed that half of the carbon contained in biomass and sediment from
   disappearing seagrass beds is lost to the atmosphere (62).

   Seagrass restoration: Increased sequestration from restoring the
   estimated 29 to 52% of historic seagrass extent that has been lost and
   could be restored (61). We estimated the average carbon sequestration
   rate in the sediment of seagrass restorations based on data from six
   seagrass restoration sites in the United States (63).

Abstract

   Human sleep is highly regulated by temperature. Might climate
   change—through increases in nighttime heat—disrupt sleep in the future?
   We conduct the inaugural investigation of the relationship between
   climatic anomalies, reports of insufficient sleep, and projected
   climate change. Using data from 765,000 U.S. survey respondents from
   2002 to 2011, coupled with nighttime temperature data, we show that
   increases in nighttime temperatures amplify self-reported nights of
   insufficient sleep. We observe the largest effects during the summer
   and among both lower-income and elderly respondents. We combine our
   historical estimates with climate model projections and detail the
   potential sleep impacts of future climatic changes. Our study
   represents the largest ever investigation of the relationship between
   sleep and ambient temperature and provides the first evidence that
   climate change may disrupt human sleep.

INTRODUCTION

   Sleep is vital for healthy human functioning. Yet, approximately
   one-third of adults report sleep difficulties, making insufficient
   sleep a pressing public health issue (1). Too little sleep increases
   susceptibility to disease and chronic illness (2, 3) and harms
   psychological and cognitive functioning (4, 5). Both body temperature
   (6, 7) and ambient temperature (8, 9) significantly influence sleep
   patterns.

   Regular and sufficient sleep serves a crucial role in maintaining and
   restoring the human body. At a physiological level, sleep loss can
   undercut the neural consolidation of new knowledge (10), the repair of
   skeletal muscles (11), and the efficient removal of waste from the
   brain (12). Insufficient sleep may also compromise immune system
   functioning (13), dysregulate metabolism (14), and increase systemic
   inflammation in the body (15). The subsequent health impacts of too
   little sleep are numerous, including increased risk for cardiovascular
   disease (3), diabetes (2), and obesity (16). From a neuropsychiatric
   standpoint, acute sleep deprivation is linked to worse mood (17), and
   sleep problems may contribute to the development of depression (4) and
   suicidality (18). Moreover, restricted sleep harms cognitive
   performance via reductions in memory, attention, and processing speed
   (5). Human well-being suffers without adequate rest.

   Of the factors affecting sleep, temperature plays an integral role.
   Normal sleep-wake cycles are governed by circadian rhythms—automatic
   biological processes that follow a 24-hour clock—and thermoregulation
   is a critical determinant of both falling asleep and staying asleep
   (6). As the body prepares for sleep, dilation of blood vessels in the
   skin facilitates heat loss, producing an important signal for sleep
   onset: a decrease in core body temperature. This core temperature
   decrease is preceded by amplification of temperature at distal sites
   (for example, the hands and feet). The ratio of distal to proximal skin
   temperature is highly predictive of sleep onset (19), suggesting that
   heat loss from distal skin temperature regions helps to cool the core
   in the evening and early morning (20). Once core body temperature drops
   to produce sleep onset, it remains low throughout the night and rises
   again shortly before awakening. By affecting circadian
   thermoregulation, ambient temperatures can interrupt the normal
   physiology of sleep (21). Previous laboratory-based studies have found
   that exposure to elevated temperatures can prevent core body heat
   shedding (9) and that poor sleep is associated with elevated core body
   temperature (7).

   Here, we report on the effect of increases in nighttime temperatures on
   reported nights of insufficient sleep of 765,000 U.S. residents
   spanning the period of 2002 to 2011. Using these data, we examine four
   questions. First, have atypically high nighttime temperatures harmed
   individuals’ reported sleep quality? Second, do the effects of
   nighttime temperatures on sleep vary by season? Third, are the effects
   most acute among those least able to cope with anomalous nighttime
   heat? Finally, might nighttime warming due to climate change increase
   the incidence of insufficient sleep in the future?

RESULTS

Main effect

   To investigate whether anomalous nighttime temperatures harmed the
   sleep quality of individuals, we constructed a data set of individuals’
   reported monthly nights of insufficient sleep linked with monthly
   historical nighttime temperature data. Our individual response data
   come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral
   Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) pooled over the period
   2002–2011. Randomly selected respondents answered the question: “During
   the past 30 days, for about how many days have you felt you did not get
   enough rest or sleep?”

   Questions from the BRFSS have been assessed for validity (22) and
   reliability (23) and are largely consistent with other health-related
   activity measures, including our specific measure of perceived sleep
   insufficiency (24). Further, this specific question is used in widely
   cited public health studies related to sleep (25).

   We combine these individual responses—marked by interview date and
   geolocated to the city level—with station-level daily temperature and
   precipitation and climate normals data from the National Centers for
   Environmental Information Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily
   (GHCN-D) (see Cities and Stations in the Supplementary Materials) (26).
   Notably, our analysis is robust to the use of gridded daily weather
   data from the PRISM Climate Group instead (see PRISM Data in the
   Supplementary Materials) (27). Our theoretical relationship of interest
   is the effect of nighttime temperature anomalies on insufficient sleep.
   We empirically model this relationship as Embedded Image Embedded Image
   (1)where β is our parameter of interest. In this pooled cross-sectional
   model, i indexes individuals, j indexes cities, s indexes seasons, and
   t indexes calendar days (our results are robust to the use of a
   negative binomial model instead; see Negative Binomial in the
   Supplementary Materials). Our dependent variable Y[ijst] represents
   respondents’ number of nights of insufficient sleep over the past 30
   days (results are robust to dichotomizing this variable in a linear
   probability model; see Linear Probability Model in the Supplementary
   Materials). Our independent variable of interest, X[jst], represents
   the 30-day average of daily minimum temperature deviations from their
   normal daily values (from 1981 to 2010) over the same 30-day window as
   respondents’ reported nights of insufficient sleep Embedded Image
   Embedded Image (2)where r indexes the days before an individual’s
   survey response date.

   The Zη term in Eq. 1 represents a set of climatic control variables
   that include average temperature range, precipitation anomalies, cloud
   cover, and humidity [with cloud cover and humidity data drawn from the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis 2
   project (28)]. We included these other meteorological variables because
   their exclusion might bias our estimates of the effect of nighttime
   temperature anomalies (although the magnitude of β is largely
   unaffected by the exclusion of these variables; see Main Effect in the
   Supplementary Materials) (29).

   Further, unobserved characteristics may influence sleep. For example,
   people may sleep better in cities with lower noise pollution or higher
   prevalence of air conditioning, on days when they are more likely to
   have leisure time, or because of other city-specific seasonal factors.
   To be sure that geographic and temporal factors like these do not
   interfere with our estimate of the effect of nighttime temperature on
   human sleep, we included γ[t], and ν[js] in Eq. 1. These terms
   represent calendar date and city-by-season indicator variables that
   account for unobserved characteristics constant across cities and days
   as well as seasonal factors that might vary differentially by city
   (30). Notably, our results are robust to varying the specification of
   these controls (see Time and Location Controls in the Supplementary
   Materials). Our empirical identifying assumption, consistent with the
   literature (31–33), is that temperature anomalies are as good as random
   after conditioning on these fixed effects. The estimated model
   coefficient β can thus be interpreted as the effect of temperature
   anomalies on reports of insufficient sleep (34–36).

   Because our estimation procedure uses exogenous city-level variations
   in nightly temperature deviations to predict individual-level outcomes,
   we account for within-city and within-day clustering of standard errors
   by using heteroskedasticity robust errors clustered on both city and
   day. Finally, we omit nonclimatic control variables from Eq. 1 because
   of their potential to generate bias—a phenomenon known as a “bad
   control” (36)—in our parameter of interest (nonetheless, our results
   are robust to the inclusion of common demographic covariates; see
   Demographic Controls in the Supplementary Materials).

   As can be seen in Fig. 1, as temperature anomalies become more
   positive, the incidence of nights with insufficient sleep increases.
   The results of estimating Eq. 1 indicate that a +1°C deviation in
   nighttime temperatures produces an increase of approximately three
   nights of insufficient sleep per 100 individuals per month (β = 0.028,
   P = 0.014, n = 766,761). Notably, nonlinear specifications of nighttime
   temperatures, precipitation, and daily temperature range return similar
   estimates of β, and a permutation test further supports our statistical
   inference (see Main Effect and Permutation Test in the Supplementary
   Materials) (37). Putting scale to the magnitude of our estimated
   effect, a harmonized +1°C nighttime temperature anomaly, if
   extrapolated across the current population of the United States, would
   produce nearly 9 million additional nights of insufficient sleep per
   month or approximately 110 million extra nights of insufficient sleep
   annually.

   Fig. 1 Nights of insufficient sleep increase with nighttime temperature
   anomalies.

   (A) Relationship between average monthly nighttime temperature
   anomalies and 765,000 respondents’ reported number of monthly nights
   with insufficient sleep from 2002 to 2011. As temperature anomalies
   become more positive, nights with insufficient sleep become more
   frequent. Points represent the average of respondents’ monthly number
   of nights with insufficient sleep for each 0.5°C nighttime temperature
   anomaly bin. The line represents a smoothing of the raw data using a
   cubic spline fit. Shaded error bounds represent the 95% confidence
   interval of this fit. (B) Distribution of 2002–2011 average monthly

   normals of 1981–2010.

Heterogeneous effects of nighttime temperature on sleep

   The above β represents an estimate of the average effect of anomalous
   nighttime temperatures on sleep over the course of a full year.
   However, because excessive heat disrupts sleep by preventing normal
   decreases in core body temperature (9, 21, 38), above-average summer
   nighttime temperatures might plausibly harm sleep more than
   above-average temperatures in cooler periods of the year. This leads us
   to our second question: Do the effects of nighttime temperatures on
   sleep vary by season?

   To investigate this question, we stratify our sample and examine Eq. 1
   for each season of the year (excluding city-by-season indicator
   variables). We find that the effect size β during summer (β = 0.073, P
   = 0.019, n = 179,117) is almost three times the magnitude of the
   effects observed during any other season of the year, as can be seen in
   Fig. 2A. The effects during spring, fall, and winter are all positive
   but are smaller in magnitude and fail to gain significance at the α =
   0.05 level.

   Fig. 2 The effect of nighttime temperature anomalies is most acute
   during the summer and among lower-income respondents and the elderly.

   (A) Marginal effects from our main model specification run on samples
   stratified by season (rescaled to an effect per 100 individuals). The
   effects observed in the summertime sample are over double the magnitude
   of those observed in other seasons. (B) Marginal effects associated
   with splitting the sample by median income. Those with under $50,000
   per year have notably higher responses to nighttime temperature
   anomalies. (C) Sample by age, showing that the effects of nighttime
   temperature anomalies on sleep are larger in the elderly. Marginal
   effects significantly different from zero at the α = 0.05 level are
   presented in red. Error bars are SEM (see regression tables in the
   Supplementary Materials).

   In addition to heterogeneous effects by season, we may expect that not
   all individuals will be similarly affected by anomalous increases in
   nighttime temperatures. This leads us to our third question: Are the
   observed effects most acute among those least able to cope with
   nighttime heat? For example, more wealthy individuals may be able to
   afford running the air conditioning at night, whereas those in
   lower-income brackets may not (39). Further, it has been observed that
   older individuals can have deficient thermoregulation (40), which may
   make their sleep cycles more vulnerable to anomalous temperatures.

   To examine whether lower-income and elderly respondents are most
   acutely disturbed by above-average nighttime heat, we stratify our
   sample along relevant demographic covariates, again estimating Eq. 1
   for each subsample. Splitting the sample along its median income
   bracket ($50,000), we find that the effect of temperature anomalies on
   insufficient sleep is greatest for lower-income respondents (see Fig.
   2B). The effect for the lower-income group (β = 0.042, P = 0.009, n =
   342,565) is over three times the magnitude of the higher-income group
   (β = 0.012, P = 0.455, n = 322,044). Next, splitting the sample along a
   common age dimension—over or under 65 years of age—we find that our
   effects in older adults (β = 0.041, P = 0.043, n = 223,211) are nearly
   twice the magnitude of those found in younger adults (β = 0.025, P =
   0.064, n = 535,968) (see Fig. 2C).

   Combining these insights, the effect observed in a subsample of
   elderly, lower-income respondents during the summer (β = 0.175, P =
   0.007, n = 30,532) is approximately 10 times the magnitude of the
   effect observed in the remainder of the sample excluding this group (β
   = 0.018, P = 0.089, n = 735,743). Thus, our data suggest that both
   lower-income and elderly individuals may be most susceptible to
   increasing nightly temperatures and that these individuals experience
   more severe sleep disruptions in response to atypically warm summer
   nights.

Potential implications of climate change for human sleep

   Our historical data indicate that past nighttime temperature anomalies
   have likely altered historical sleep patterns in meaningful ways. In
   the future, climate change is likely to produce an increased frequency
   of above-average nighttime temperatures (see Fig. 3A) (41), and
   observed nighttime temperatures have been increasing more rapidly than
   daytime temperatures over the last century (42). These observations
   lead us to our fourth question: Might warming nighttime temperatures
   due to climate change increase the incidence of insufficient sleep in
   the future?

   Fig. 3 Climate change may amplify human sleep loss.

   (A) Distributions of nighttime temperature anomalies calculated from 21
   downscaled climate models for the cities in our sample in 2010, 2050,
   and 2099. Nighttime temperature anomalies from the 1981–2010 city
   nighttime temperature normals increase in both magnitude and variation
   by 2050 and 2099 as compared to 2010. (B) City-level forecasts for the
   impact of climate change on monthly nights of insufficient sleep per
   100 individuals. To incorporate downscaled climate model uncertainty,
   we calculate an estimated change for an ensemble of 21 climatic models
   for 219 cities, producing nearly 4600 estimates for both 2050 and 2099.
   The change between 2010 and 2050 is represented by golden lines,
   whereas the predicted change between 2050 and 2099 is represented by
   red lines. The black dashed lines plot the median predicted change
   between each period. (C) Mean predicted change in sleep for each period
   across all climate models (rescaled to an effect per 100 individuals).
   Error bars are SEM and incorporate downscaled climate model
   uncertainty.

   To examine this question, we calculate projected nighttime temperature
   anomalies for 2050 and 2099 from NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily
   Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) bias-corrected, statistically
   downscaled (to 25 km × 25 km), nightly temperature projections (43)
   drawn from 21 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
   (CMIP5) models (44) run on the Representative Concentration Pathways
   “high emissions” scenario (RCP8.5) (45). We extract the projections’
   time series for the grid cells associated with each city and couple
   these predicted anomalies with our historical estimate of the
   relationship between nighttime temperature anomalies and insufficient
   sleep—β from Eq. 1—to calculate a forecast of possible insufficient
   sleep due to future nighttime warming at the city level for each
   downscaled climate model. We define our forecast of the increase in
   insufficient nights of sleep due to climate change by 2050 (ΔY[mj2050])
   as Embedded Image Embedded Image (3)and for the additional effect from
   2050 to 2099 (ΔY[mj2099]) as Embedded Image Embedded Image (4)where m
   indexes the 21 specific climate models, j indexes the city, and t
   indexes the day. X[mjt]—our measure of 30-day nighttime temperature
   anomalies—is calculated as in Eq. 2, using 1981–2010 as the baseline.
   This forecasting procedure enables us to incorporate uncertainty
   regarding future downscaled climatic projections into our forecast
   (29). Figure 3B plots the estimation results. Each of the 219 cities in
   our analysis has a prediction for each of the 21 downscaled climate
   models, producing approximately 4600 estimates per period. On average,
   we project that climate change may cause approximately 6 additional
   nights of insufficient sleep per 100 individuals by 2050 and an excess
   of approximately 14 nights per 100 individuals by 2099 (see Fig. 3C).

   In addition, the effects of climate change on nighttime
   temperatures—and thus the potential impacts of climate change on
   sleep—are likely to vary geographically across the United States. To
   investigate the spatial distribution of potential reductions in
   sufficient sleep due to climate change, we take the ensemble average of
   the 21 NEX downscaled climate models for each of the 2010, 2050, and
   2099 forecasts. We then take the yearly average of nighttime
   temperature anomalies for each grid cell in the continental United
   States in each year. For the 2050 forecast, we assign to each grid cell
   the difference in average nighttime temperature anomaly between 2010
   and 2050. For the 2099 forecast, we assign to each grid cell the
   difference in average anomalies between 2010 and 2099. As can be seen
   in Fig. 4—with effects scaled to be per 100 individuals—areas of the
   western and northern United States are likely to have the most
   significant changes in nighttime temperatures and, as a result, may see
   the greatest increase in climate change–induced nights of insufficient
   sleep.

   Fig. 4 Geographic dispersion of the predicted effects of climate
   change–induced nighttime warming on human sleep.

   This figure presents the 25-km × 25-km grid cell forecasts of the
   potential impact of nighttime warming on monthly nights of insufficient
   sleep per 100 individuals. Downscaled climatic model data are averaged
   across the 21 models in the ensemble and then coupled with our
   historical model parameter β to produce an estimated change in
   insufficient sleep in each geographic location for the periods of 2050
   and 2099. Areas of the western and northern United States—where
   nighttime temperatures are projected to increase most acutely—may
   experience the largest future changes in sleep.

DISCUSSION

   Our analysis of historical data demonstrates a robust link between
   atypical nightly temperatures and insufficient sleep that is largest
   during the summer and among lower-income individuals and the elderly.
   Moreover, across both our city-level and geographic grid cell–level
   forecasts, we predict that every location in the United States may
   experience an increased incidence of insufficient sleep due to
   nighttime warming induced by future climate change.

   These findings correspond to a growing literature on the close ties
   between temperature, climate, and human health and well-being (35).
   Recent studies have demonstrated the effects of temperature on
   mortality and morbidity (46–50) as well as on psychological states and
   propensity for crime and other forms of violence (51–54), although, to
   our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine the implications of
   climate change for human sleep.

   There are several considerations important to the interpretation of the
   results of this study. First, although we have data on hundreds of
   thousands of individuals’ reports of insufficient sleep, optimal data
   would also contain objective measurements of each individual’s nightly
   sleep duration. Reports of insufficient sleep may be driven due to
   actual sleep loss, but they may also be driven by other factors such as
   excess fatigue due to warmer than normal temperatures.

   This point raises a second consideration: Here, we focus on the average
   treatment effect of nighttime temperature anomalies on a measure of
   sleep sufficiency. Yet, it is likely that there are interactive effects
   between sleep and other physiological and psychological metrics. Future
   study of these other metrics will be important to help identify the
   causal mechanisms underpinning our results. Third, future attainment of
   sufficient sleep will be determined by factors in addition to nighttime
   temperatures—including use of technology, hours worked, stress levels,
   changes to the built environment (55), and many others—that may each
   trend differentially going forward. The potential effects of nighttime
   warming on sleep may be exacerbated or even reduced by these other
   sleep-related trends. Further studies are needed to clarify how
   increased nighttime temperatures may interact with these factors.
   Fourth, because respondents are geolocated to the city level,
   measurement error may exist between the nighttime temperatures observed
   at weather stations and the temperatures respondents actually
   experienced, possibly attenuating the size of our estimates (56). This,
   in turn, suggests that our results may represent a lower bound for the
   estimate of “business as usual” climate change on human sleep. Finally,
   our analysis is conducted on a randomly sampled, pooled cross section
   of respondents. An ideal source of data would track the same
   individuals over time to enable controlling for individual-specific
   characteristics.

   Ultimately, if observed temperature-sleep relationships from the recent
   past persist, further climate change–induced nighttime warming may
   reduce the attainment of sufficient sleep, magnifying many of the
   physiological and psychological costs of sleep deprivation. These costs
   may be most acute for the poor and elderly. Although adaptations to
   changing nighttime temperature distributions may mitigate some or all
   of these sleep effects, positive feedback loops from the other
   potential social impacts of climate change—such as increased stress,
   acute trauma, and interpersonal conflict—could amplify them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

   We collected data for this project from the public domain. We used the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BRFSS Selected
   Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends product for our measure of
   nights of insufficient sleep. We gathered daily meteorological data
   from the National Centers for Environmental Information GHCN-D product,
   the NCEP Reanalysis 2, and the PRISM Climate Group. In addition, we
   incorporated climate model data from the NEX-GDDP bias-corrected,
   statistically downscaled models.

Abstract

   The rapid growth of the use and disposal of plastic materials has
   proved to be a challenge for solid waste management systems with
   impacts on our environment and ocean. While recycling and the circular
   economy have been touted as potential solutions, upward of half of the
   plastic waste intended for recycling has been exported to hundreds of
   countries around the world. China, which has imported a cumulative 45%
   of plastic waste since 1992, recently implemented a new policy banning
   the importation of most plastic waste, begging the question of where
   the plastic waste will go now. We use commodity trade data for mass and
   value, region, and income level to illustrate that higher-income
   countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation have been
   exporting plastic waste (70% in 2016) to lower-income countries in the
   East Asia and Pacific for decades. An estimated 111 million metric tons
   of plastic waste will be displaced with the new Chinese policy by 2030.
   As 89% of historical exports consist of polymer groups often used in
   single-use plastic food packaging (polyethylene, polypropylene, and
   polyethylene terephthalate), bold global ideas and actions for reducing
   quantities of nonrecyclable materials, redesigning products, and
   funding domestic plastic waste management are needed.

INTRODUCTION

   Plastic has become a major commodity on a global scale and has
   infiltrated almost every aspect of human life. The historic growth in
   production has outpaced almost all other manufactured materials from 2
   million metric tons (MT) produced in 1950 to 322 million MT produced in
   2015 (1, 2). A cumulative total of 8.3 billion MT of plastic has been
   produced as of 2017 (1). Plastic is a very useful material (moldable,
   durable, light, and inexpensive), and packaging is the most significant
   sector (40%) of use (2). Plastic as a material for packaging has had
   significant advantages, allowing companies to market effectively,
   design appealing-looking and appealing-feeling packages, prevent loss
   from store shelves, and transport goods efficiently and economically
   throughout the world. However, plastic packaging for food, beverage,
   and tobacco items is often used only once, which has contributed to 61%
   of global beach litter (3).

   While the use of plastic has expanded quickly, little thought has been
   given to the impact of this growing use on solid waste management
   systems, which have had to react to the influx of new and variable
   materials entering the solid waste stream. Plastic packaging and
   single-use items enter the waste stream immediately after use,
   contributing to a cumulative total of 6.3 billion MT of plastic waste
   generated worldwide (1). Management of this large increase and quantity
   of plastic waste has been challenging, particularly in areas of rapid
   economic development and population growth. Only 9% of plastic waste
   has been recycled globally, with the overwhelming majority of global
   plastic waste being landfilled or ending up contaminating the
   environment (80%), resulting in an estimated 4 million to 12 million MT
   of waste plastic entering the oceans annually (1, 4).

   Plastics can be challenging to recycle because of the wide variety of
   uses, additives, and blends that are used in a multitude of products
   (5), as well as the fact that there are material properties that can
   limit the number of times that products can be recycled. Commingled and
   single-stream recycling operations have also contributed to more
   contamination than ever before in the recycling stream, especially for
   plastic waste, but the emerging markets in China in the 1990s found
   that the material could be used profitably, especially when ships could
   efficiently deliver the material, and that it could be used to
   manufacture more goods for sale or export. For exporting countries,
   shipping-processed plastic waste to China and surrounding countries has
   provided an outlet for managing plastic waste, preventing it from going
   to landfill or incineration in the source countries (6).

   China has increasingly implemented more rigid waste import policies,
   starting prior to 2010 (7). Then, in 2013, the relationship between
   plastic waste exporters and China as the primary importer was disrupted
   when China introduced a temporary restriction on waste imports that
   required significantly less contamination. This operation was referred
   to as the “Green Fence” and highlighted the fragility of global
   dependence on a single importer. The goal of the Green Fence campaign
   was to increase the quality of the plastic waste that China was
   receiving while also reducing illegal foreign smuggling and trading
   (6). While informal (that is, undocumented) flows of plastic waste are
   known to occur, available data from the European Union (EU) estimate
   that these instances are a fraction of the waste that which is legally
   traded and documented. That said, the Green Fence succeeded in its
   aforementioned goals; however, it did not entirely stop the informal
   flow of plastic waste, and true quantities are unknown at this time.
   While the Green Fence campaign was temporary, in 2017, China announced
   a new import policy permanently banning the import of nonindustrial
   plastic waste (8).

   Here, we quantify the cascading impacts of this new Chinese import ban.
   We characterize the rapid globalization of management of plastic waste,
   identifying major import and export trends by region and income level.
   Twenty-eight years of data (1988–2016) were compiled from the United
   Nations (UN) Comtrade Database on the imports and exports of the
   category “plastic waste, parings, and scrap” for four polymer
   classifications: polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
   polystyrene (PS), and others (9–12) reported by mass (in kilograms) and
   trade value (in U.S. dollars). The “other” plastics group includes
   plastic waste polymers that do not yet have an internationally
   harmonized code used for reporting but encompasses trade of polymers
   such as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). To
   quantify the magnitude of the Chinese regulations regarding imports of
   forbidden and constrained waste items, we estimated the quantity of
   plastic waste that would be displaced on the basis of historical
   cumulative imports of plastic waste into China. Historical cumulative
   import data were projected forward in a business-as-usual (BAU)
   scenario using a best-fit trendline analysis, bounded by upper and
   lower estimates (figs. S1 to S4).

RESULTS

   Global annual imports and exports of plastic waste began to rapidly
   increase in 1993, having grown 723 and 817% in 2016, respectively (Fig.
   1). In 2016 alone, about half of all plastic waste intended for
   recycling (14.1 million MT) was exported by 123 countries, with China
   taking most of it (7.35 million MT) from 43 different countries (Fig.
   2) (9–13). Since it began reporting in 1992, China has imported 106
   million MT of plastic waste, making up 45.1% of all cumulative imports
   (Table 1). Collectively, China and Hong Kong have imported 72.4% of all
   plastic waste. However, Hong Kong acts as an entry port into China,
   with most of the plastic waste imported to Hong Kong (63%) going
   directly to China as an export in 2016. With the projected BAU Chinese
   import data, an estimated cumulative 111 million MT of plastic waste
   will be displaced by 2030 (Fig. 3). The displaced plastic waste is
   equal to nearly half (47%) of all plastic waste that has been imported
   globally since reporting began in 1988.

   Fig. 3 Estimated mass of global displaced plastic waste due to the new
   Chinese import ban based on cumulative imports of PE, PS, PVC, and
   other plastics into China [UN Comtrade data; (9–12)].

   The BAU (business as usual) projection of Chinese imports was created
   by using a linear regression of the last 10 years of imports. The
   Chinese ban on importation of plastic waste is based on a 100%
   implementation of the regulation (see the Supplementary Materials for
   details).

   High Income (HIC) countries have overwhelmingly been the primary
   exporters of plastic waste since 1988, contributing to 87% of all
   exports and valued at $71 billion USD (Table 1 and table S1). Imports
   of plastic waste are almost evenly split between HIC and Upper Middle
   Income (UMI) countries, which collectively account for 96% of all
   imports and are valued at $106 billion USD (Table 1 and table S1). All
   of the top 10 countries exporting plastic waste are HIC, except for
   Mexico (UMI) ranking fifth. Seven of the top 10 countries importing
   plastic waste are HIC as well, except for China (first), India (ninth),
   and other Asia not elsewhere specified (see note # in Table 1). If
   taken collectively, then the EU-28 would be the top exporter.

   Regionally, EAP (East Asia and Pacific) countries are characterized as
   the leading exporters of plastic waste; however, this is because of the
   large flow of exports from Hong Kong to China (fig. S5). Excluding Hong
   Kong, ECA (Europe and Central Asia) countries lead in exporting (for
   example, Germany, UK, and Netherlands), contributing to 32% ($27.6
   billion USD) of all exports, followed by NA countries (United States
   and Canada) contributing to 14% ($14.3 billion USD) of exports (see
   footnote ∥ in Table 1 and table S2). EAP countries have dominated the
   import of plastic waste, having imported 75% ($83.3 billion USD) of
   plastic waste imports since 1988 (table S2). Collectively, the nation
   members of the OECD have contributed to 64% ($57.4 billion USD) of all
   exports, suggesting that the trade of plastic waste may largely be
   occurring between OECD and EAP countries (see note 2 in table S2).
   Furthermore, 33 of 35 OECD countries are considered HIC, 90% of the top
   10 exporting countries are members of the OECD, and 23 of 36 EAP
   countries are low- or middle-income countries. These findings are
   consistent with historical trends of waste management practices in
   which low- and middle-income countries often import waste material for
   recycling (14). Consequently, wealthier nations, with more robust waste
   management infrastructure, are sending plastic waste to countries that
   are still developing economically with less-developed waste management
   infrastructure. Relatively high domestic management costs in exporting
   countries versus the cheaper processing fees in China have driven the
   trends illustrated here (for example, it is often cheaper to transport
   recycled materials by ship to China than it is to transport
   domestically by truck or rail) (15). In addition, exporting countries
   have preserved solid waste management capacity by sending waste to
   China where there are progressive environmental policies related to
   circular economy (for example, Environmental Protection Law, Circular
   Economy Promotion Law, etc.) (16); however, implementation of these
   policies has lagged, largely because of the top-down approach that has
   been taken, which lacks social and environmental indicators supporting
   market-based policy and public participation (16, 17).

   Of the four polymer groups, the “other plastics” group is the most
   commonly traded plastic waste comprising a cumulative 131 million MT
   imported ($61.5 billion USD) and 123 million MT exported ($50.4 billion
   USD) traded between 1988 and 2016, followed by PE, which has had 67
   million MT exported ($25.5 billion USD) and 71 million MT imported
   ($33.2 billion USD) since 1988 (fig. S6). Within this time period,
   China has imported primarily other plastics and PE (fig. S7). Excluding
   Hong Kong, the United States is the leading exporter of PVC and other
   plastics. Germany is the leading exporter of PE, and Japan is the
   leading exporter of PS. Each of these countries remains in the list of
   top five cumulative exporters for all four polymer groups. China is the
   leading importer of three of four polymer groups (table S3), with Hong
   Kong leading China in importing PS.

DISCUSSION

   China is still developing solid waste management infrastructure, and an
   estimated 1.3 million to 3.5 million MT of plastic is estimated to
   enter the oceans annually from its coastline (4). Using population
   data, waste generation rates, and percent plastic in the waste stream,
   we estimated the contribution of imports to the domestic waste stream
   in China. On the basis of the data from 2010 to 2016, the import of
   plastic waste to China contributes 10 to 13% additional mass to the
   domestic plastic waste that is already generated within the country and
   is difficult to manage. In 2016, the imports (7.35 million MT)
   contributed another 10.8% of waste to the 60.9 million MT of plastic
   waste estimated to be generated in China (table S4).

   The UN Comtrade data alone cannot accurately portray what is happening
   to plastic waste worldwide and does not trace the movement of waste
   between countries, which is a limitation of this research. For example,
   while we did obtain industry data showing that the United States
   imports plastic waste from Mexico, we do not know whether that waste is
   then processed domestically or exported to Hong Kong or China. The fact
   that plastic waste transfer between countries can be convoluted
   provides impetus for closely monitoring plastic waste to accurately
   track and better manage it. In addition, two of the most commonly used
   polymers, PET and PP, lack specific data because trade codes for these
   waste materials are not yet harmonized.

   In 2013, the Chinese Green Fence campaign resulted in a reduction of
   plastic waste accepted at the Chinese border, with some shipments being
   turned away and sent back to the source countries. As a result, plastic
   recycling industries experienced a globally cascading effect since
   little infrastructure exists elsewhere to manage the rejected waste. A
   $446 million USD and $298 million USD reduction in export and import
   trade values, respectively, occurred from 2012 to 2013 (Fig. 1). While
   the value of plastic waste trade did not recover to levels seen before
   the Green Fence, it remained significant in 2016, and the Green Fence
   was only a small sample of the potential impact of the recent policy
   banning waste imports. Furthermore, since it restricts legal trade, the
   new import ban policy could increase the informal and illegal flow of
   plastic waste.

   Suggestions from the recycling industry demonstrate that, if no
   adjustments are made in solid waste management, and plastic waste
   management in particular, then much of the waste originally diverted
   from landfills by consumers paying for a recycling service will
   ultimately be landfilled (6). Furthermore, it is possible that EAP
   countries surrounding China could also receive the displaced plastic
   waste; however, many of these countries lack the infrastructure to
   manage their own plastic waste, let alone a rapid increase in plastic
   waste supplied by other countries. While there are some country-level
   assessments that exist (for example, World Bank, OECD, etc.), there is
   no global standard for the classification of countries that have
   sufficient infrastructure to manage imported plastic waste.

   Both the displaced plastic waste and future increases in plastic
   recycling must be addressed immediately. Initially, the countries
   exporting the most plastic waste can use this as an opportunity to
   develop and expand internal markets. If domestic recycling of plastic
   waste is not possible, then this constraint reinforces the motivation
   to reduce use and redesign plastic packaging and products so that they
   retain their value and are more recyclable in domestic markets. In
   addition, the import and export of plastic waste are another
   justification for a global agreement relating to the use and management
   of plastic materials called for previously (18, 19). Of relevance to
   this discussion is the fact that the international Basel Convention,
   which governs the export of hazardous and other waste, already exists.
   For example, if plastic waste were characterized as a “waste requiring
   special consideration” (Y46) under the Basel Convention, then export
   could potentially be regulated. Basel also provides a framework for
   knowledge sharing and promoting the proper management of waste,
   including harmonization of technical standards and practices, which
   could help build capacity to properly manage plastic waste around the
   world. One legal concept that could be applied to the management of
   plastic waste is strict liability, holding both waste producers and
   exporters accountable for making sure that the material they ship is
   properly managed by any receiving entity. Lastly, each country wishing
   to continue to import significant quantities of plastic waste could
   consider an import tax specifically to fund the development of solid
   waste management infrastructure within that country.

   With plastic production and use continuing to rise, and companies and
   countries both committing to circular economies and increasing plastic
   recycling rates, the quantity of plastic waste needing a “home” will
   continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Where will the plastic
   waste go now? Without bold new ideas and management strategies, current
   recycling rates will no longer be met, and ambitious goals and
   timelines for future recycling growth will be insurmountable.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Historical trade of plastic waste

   The UN Comtrade Database provides the most comprehensive international
   trade data regarding imports and exports of many commodities. Trade
   data were organized on the basis of the Harmonized Commodity
   Description and Coding Systems (HS), which was implemented by the UN in
   1988. This system provides an international nomenclature structure for
   international trade commodities. Countries and regions can report data
   regarding traded items based on the given code. Reported trade flows
   include net weight (in kilograms) of exports, imports, reexports, and
   reimports. In addition, trade values associated with annual trade of
   plastic waste were provided by the UN database in U.S. dollars. Annual
   values were based on reported tonnage and corresponding trade values
   between 1 January and 31 December each year. Within the UN Comtrade
   data is information regarding the global trade of plastic waste
   including waste, parings, and scraps of PE (3915.10), PS (3915.20), PVC
   (3915.30), and other plastics (3915.90) (9–12). Other plastics include
   trade data for plastic waste polymers that do not have an individual HS
   trading code such as PP and PET.

   Any commodity, including plastic waste, can be reimported and
   reexported for a variety of reasons. According to the UN, reexported
   material may be “defective, the importer might have defaulted on
   payments or canceled the order, the authorities might have imposed an
   import barrier, or demand or prices in the country of origin might have
   made it worthwhile to bring the good back” (20). Both the reimport and
   reexport values were incorporated into the overall trade quantities
   reported in this study and contributed only 0.02 and 9.3% of all global
   imports and exports since 1988.

   Since the implementation of the HS, trade information for plastic waste
   as commodities was reported by 191 countries from 1988 to 2016. Of the
   four plastic waste categories, 175 countries reported exports greater
   than 0 MT, and 190 have reported imports greater than 0 MT. Because of
   geopolitical changes in national boundaries and names, trade data were
   combined for some reporting countries and territories. For example,
   data from 1988 to 1990 were reported by the “Former Federal Republic of
   Germany.” Data from 1991 to 2016 were reported by “Germany.” These two
   data sets were combined and reported as Germany. In addition, data from
   each of the 28 nations participating in the EU were combined for
   comparison of Europe’s trading of plastic waste (see footnote ¶ in
   Table 1). It should be noted that variation in how reporting is done,
   valuation between the commodity source and destination country, and
   timing of reporting can affect the consistency and reliability of the
   data.

   The available data for PE, PS, PVC, and other plastics from 1988 to
   2016 were used to determine historical and regional trends of
   international trade of plastic waste in terms of net weight and trade
   value. We analyzed trade patterns over time by country, income level
   and region, and individual polymer. Data were compiled and sorted for
   all reporting countries for each of the four plastic waste polymers. In
   addition, World Bank regional assignments and income levels were
   applied to every reporting country for all trade flows, plastic waste
   polymer categories, and years in which data were available. Economic
   classifications were based on 2015 gross national income estimations
   reported by the World Bank (21). Regional classifications were assigned
   on the basis of the current World Bank assignment groups (22, 23).
   Cumulative values of traded recycled waste from 1988 to 2016 were used
   to create historical rankings of reporting countries, income status,
   world regions, and polymers (Table 1 and tables S1 to S3).

   Finally, cumulative values were used to show geographic trends by
   country in ArcGIS 10.4 (Fig. 2 and figs. S8 to S12). Quantitative
   symbolization based on cumulative net weight of traded recycled
   polymers was used to provide geographic understanding of trade of
   plastic waste. Radial flow maps were generated using the Data
   Management XY to Line tool for the 2016 exports of PE, PS, and PVC from
   the top five historical exporters excluding Hong Kong (United States,
   Japan, Germany, Mexico, and UK) (figs. S8 to S12) (24–26). Sources of
   Chinese imports of plastic waste in 2016 were visualized by radial flow
   maps, weighted, and shaded on the basis of reported net weight (Fig. 1)
   (13).

Displaced plastic waste

   To estimate the quantity of plastic waste displaced by the new Chinese
   regulations, we examined historical trends for the import of plastic
   waste into China. The projection assumed that no imports of plastic
   waste were made after the implementation of the regulations as of 31
   December 2017 as per the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection
   announcement. Overall, the new regulations ban the following categories
   of items: (i) forbidden items (n = 125), (ii) constrained items (n =
   32), and (iii) allowed items (n = 18) (8). Forbidden wastes are no
   longer allowed to be imported into China, and constrained waste is only
   accepted if it meets specific material standards. Eight types of
   plastic waste from consumer goods are now banned including plastic
   waste polymers of PE, PS, PVC, PET, and others (for example, PP), as
   well as bales of PET plastic bottles, aluminum plastic film, and
   compact disk/digital video disks. Industrial plastic waste that meets
   Chinese control standard GB 16487.12 is still conditionally accepted
   (27).

   The displaced plastic was represented by the difference between the
   projected BAU cumulative Chinese imports in 2030 and the 100%
   implementation of the ban in 2030. Three different regression fits were
   made using (i) a linear fit of all the data (1988–2016) that resulted
   in fig. S1 and a coefficient of determination (R^2) of 0.89, (ii) a
   second-order polynomial fit of all the data (1988–2016) that resulted
   in fig. S2 and an R^2 of 1.0, and (iii) a linear fit of the linear part
   of the curve, in the last 10 years (2006–2016), which resulted in fig.
   S3 and an R^2 of 1.0. The highest and lowest of these projections were
   used to bound our estimate of displaced plastic. The “best” estimate is
   in between the linear regression of all the data (projected at 63.3
   million MT) and the second-order polynomial (projected at 195 million
   MT). Thus, the 10-year linear regression estimate of 111 million MT
   became the best estimate (fig. S4). Although the announcement of the
   new regulations suggested complete restrictions on the imports of
   recycled waste, analyses of 50 and 75% restriction scenarios were
   provided. The quantity of displaced plastic waste was calculated for
   the year, immediately following the restrictions (2018), and every 5
   years from 2020 to 2030 (table S5).

Impact of imported plastic waste in China

   The imported plastic waste into China has an impact on their existing
   waste stream. To examine this impact, the population of China for years
   2010 to 2016 was obtained from the World Bank. Values for Chinese waste
   generation rates and percent plastic in the waste stream were obtained
   from Jambeck et al. (4). Waste generation rates were multiplied by the
   population and converted to years and MT to calculate the plastic waste
   generation (in MT) per year. We then summed the plastic waste
   generation values and imported plastic waste values to determine the
   total waste to be managed within China per year. Finally, the impact
   was estimated by the percentage of plastic waste that was imported each
   year divided by the total waste to be managed.

Abstract

   Plastics have outgrown most man-made materials and have long been under
   environmental scrutiny. However, robust global information,
   particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying
   and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life
   management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we
   present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever
   manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of
   virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately
   6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had
   been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in
   landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste
   management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be
   in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.

INTRODUCTION

   A world without plastics, or synthetic organic polymers, seems
   unimaginable today, yet their large-scale production and use only dates
   back to ~1950. Although the first synthetic plastics, such as Bakelite,
   appeared in the early 20th century, widespread use of plastics outside
   of the military did not occur until after World War II. The ensuing
   rapid growth in plastics production is extraordinary, surpassing most
   other man-made materials. Notable exceptions are materials that are
   used extensively in the construction sector, such as steel and cement
   (1, 2).

   Instead, plastics’ largest market is packaging, an application whose
   growth was accelerated by a global shift from reusable to single-use
   containers. As a result, the share of plastics in municipal solid waste
   (by mass) increased from less than 1% in 1960 to more than 10% by 2005
   in middle- and high-income countries (3). At the same time, global
   solid waste generation, which is strongly correlated with gross
   national income per capita, has grown steadily over the past five
   decades (4, 5).

   The vast majority of monomers used to make plastics, such as ethylene
   and propylene, are derived from fossil hydrocarbons. None of the
   commonly used plastics are biodegradable. As a result, they accumulate,
   rather than decompose, in landfills or the natural environment (6). The
   only way to permanently eliminate plastic waste is by destructive
   thermal treatment, such as combustion or pyrolysis. Thus,
   near-permanent contamination of the natural environment with plastic
   waste is a growing concern. Plastic debris has been found in all major
   ocean basins (6), with an estimated 4 to 12 million metric tons (Mt) of
   plastic waste generated on land entering the marine environment in 2010
   alone (3). Contamination of freshwater systems and terrestrial habitats
   is also increasingly reported (7–9), as is environmental contamination
   with synthetic fibers (9, 10). Plastic waste is now so ubiquitous in
   the environment that it has been suggested as a geological indicator of
   the proposed Anthropocene era (11).

   We present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever
   made by developing and combining global data on production, use, and
   end-of-life fate of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives
   into a comprehensive material flow model. The analysis includes
   thermoplastics, thermosets, polyurethanes (PURs), elastomers, coatings,
   and sealants but focuses on the most prevalent resins and fibers:
   high-density polyethylene (PE), low-density and linear low-density PE,
   polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinylchloride (PVC),
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and PUR resins; and polyester,
   polyamide, and acrylic (PP&A) fibers. The pure polymer is mixed with
   additives to enhance the properties of the material.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

   Global production of resins and fibers increased from 2 Mt in 1950 to
   380 Mt in 2015, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4% (table
   S1), roughly 2.5 times the CAGR of the global gross domestic product
   during that period (12, 13). The total amount of resins and fibers
   manufactured from 1950 through 2015 is 7800 Mt. Half of this—3900
   Mt—was produced in just the past 13 years. Today, China alone accounts
   for 28% of global resin and 68% of global PP&A fiber production
   (13–15). Bio-based or biodegradable plastics currently have a global
   production capacity of only 4 Mt and are excluded from this analysis
   (16).

   We compiled production statistics for resins, fibers, and additives
   from a variety of industry sources and synthesized them according to
   type and consuming sector (table S2 and figs. S1 and S2) (12–24). Data
   on fiber and additives production are not readily available and have
   typically been omitted until now. On average, we find that nonfiber
   plastics contain 93% polymer resin and 7% additives by mass. When
   including additives in the calculation, the amount of nonfiber plastics
   (henceforth defined as resins plus additives) manufactured since 1950
   increases to 7300 Mt. PP&A fibers add another 1000 Mt. Plasticizers,
   fillers, and flame retardants account for about three quarters of all
   additives (table S3). The largest groups in total nonfiber plastics
   production are PE (36%), PP (21%), and PVC (12%), followed by PET, PUR,
   and PS (<10% each). Polyester, most of which is PET, accounts for 70%
   of all PP&A fiber production. Together, these seven groups account for
   92% of all plastics ever made. Approximately 42% of all nonfiber
   plastics have been used for packaging, which is predominantly composed
   of PE, PP, and PET. The building and construction sector, which has
   used 69% of all PVC, is the next largest consuming sector, using 19% of
   all nonfiber plastics (table S2).

   We combined plastic production data with product lifetime distributions
   for eight different industrial use sectors, or product categories, to
   model how long plastics are in use before they reach the end of their
   useful lifetimes and are discarded (22, 25–29). We assumed log-normal
   distributions with means ranging from less than 1 year, for packaging,
   to decades, for building and construction (Fig. 1). This is a commonly
   used modeling approach to estimating waste generation for specific
   materials (22, 25, 26). A more direct way to measure plastic waste
   generation is to combine solid waste generation data with waste
   characterization information, as in the study of Jambeck et al. (3).
   However, for many countries, these data are not available in the detail
   and quality required for the present analysis.

   Fig. 1 Product lifetime distributions for the eight industrial use
   sectors plotted as log-normal probability distribution functions (PDF).

   Note that sectors other and textiles have the same PDF.

   We estimate that in 2015, 407 Mt of primary plastics (plastics
   manufactured from virgin materials) entered the use phase, whereas 302
   Mt left it. Thus, in 2015, 105 Mt were added to the in-use stock. For
   comparison, we estimate that plastic waste generation in 2010 was 274
   Mt, which is equal to the independently derived estimate of 275 Mt by
   Jambeck et al. (3). The different product lifetimes lead to a
   substantial shift in industrial use sector and polymer type between
   plastics entering and leaving use in any given year (tables S4 and S5
   and figs. S1 to S4). Most of the packaging plastics leave use the same
   year they are produced, whereas construction plastics leaving use were
   produced decades earlier, when production quantities were much lower.
   For example, in 2015, 42% of primary nonfiber plastics produced (146
   Mt) entered use as packaging and 19% (65 Mt) as construction, whereas
   nonfiber plastic waste leaving use was 54% packaging (141 Mt) and only
   5% construction (12 Mt). Similarly, in 2015, PVC accounted for 11% of
   nonfiber plastics production (38 Mt) and only 6% of nonfiber plastic
   waste generation (16 Mt).

   By the end of 2015, all plastic waste ever generated from primary
   plastics had reached 5800 Mt, 700 Mt of which were PP&A fibers. There
   are essentially three different fates for plastic waste. First, it can
   be recycled or reprocessed into a secondary material (22, 26).
   Recycling delays, rather than avoids, final disposal. It reduces future
   plastic waste generation only if it displaces primary plastic
   production (30); however, because of its counterfactual nature, this
   displacement is extremely difficult to establish (31). Furthermore,
   contamination and the mixing of polymer types generate secondary
   plastics of limited or low technical and economic value. Second,
   plastics can be destroyed thermally. Although there are emerging
   technologies, such as pyrolysis, which extracts fuel from plastic
   waste, to date, virtually all thermal destruction has been by
   incineration, with or without energy recovery. The environmental and
   health impacts of waste incinerators strongly depend on emission
   control technology, as well as incinerator design and operation.
   Finally, plastics can be discarded and either contained in a managed
   system, such as sanitary landfills, or left uncontained in open dumps
   or in the natural environment.

   We estimate that 2500 Mt of plastics—or 30% of all plastics ever
   produced—are currently in use. Between 1950 and 2015, cumulative waste
   generation of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste amounted
   to 6300 Mt. Of this, approximately 800 Mt (12%) of plastics have been
   incinerated and 600 Mt (9%) have been recycled, only 10% of which have
   been recycled more than once. Around 4900 Mt—60% of all plastics ever
   produced—were discarded and are accumulating in landfills or in the
   natural environment (Fig. 2). Of this, 600 Mt were PP&A fibers. None of
   the mass-produced plastics biodegrade in any meaningful way; however,
   sunlight weakens the materials, causing fragmentation into particles
   known to reach millimeters or micrometers in size (32). Research into
   the environmental impacts of these “microplastics” in marine and
   freshwater environments has accelerated in recent years (33), but
   little is known about the impacts of plastic waste in land-based
   ecosystems.

   Fig. 2 Global production, use, and fate of polymer resins, synthetic
   fibers, and additives (1950 to 2015; in million metric tons).

   Before 1980, plastic recycling and incineration were negligible. Since
   then, only nonfiber plastics have been subject to significant recycling
   efforts. The following results apply to nonfiber plastic only: Global
   recycling and incineration rates have slowly increased to account for
   18 and 24%, respectively, of nonfiber plastic waste generated in 2014
   (figs. S5 and S6). On the basis of limited available data, the highest
   recycling rates in 2014 were in Europe (30%) and China (25%), whereas
   in the United States, plastic recycling has remained steady at 9% since
   2012 (12, 13, 34–36). In Europe and China, incineration rates have
   increased over time to reach 40 and 30%, respectively, in 2014 (13,
   35). However, in the United States, nonfiber plastics incineration
   peaked at 21% in 1995 before decreasing to 16% in 2014 as recycling
   rates increased, with discard rates remaining constant at 75% during
   that time period (34). Waste management information for 52 other
   countries suggests that in 2014, the rest of the world had recycling
   and incineration rates similar to those of the United States (37). To
   date, end-of-life textiles (fiber products) do not experience
   significant recycling rates and are thus incinerated or discarded
   together with other solid waste.

   Primary plastics production data describe a robust time trend
   throughout its entire history. If production were to continue on this
   curve, humankind will have produced 26,000 Mt of resins, 6000 Mt of
   PP&A fibers, and 2000 Mt of additives by the end of 2050. Assuming
   consistent use patterns and projecting current global waste management
   trends to 2050 (fig. S7), 9000 Mt of plastic waste will have been
   recycled, 12,000 Mt incinerated, and 12,000 Mt discarded in landfills
   or the natural environment (Fig. 3).

   Fig. 3 Cumulative plastic waste generation and disposal (in million
   metric tons).

   Solid lines show historical data from 1950 to 2015; dashed lines show
   projections of historical trends to 2050.

   Any material flow analysis of this kind requires multiple assumptions
   or simplifications, which are listed in Materials and Methods, and is
   subject to considerable uncertainty; as such, all cumulative results
   are rounded to the nearest 100 Mt. The largest sources of uncertainty
   are the lifetime distributions of the product categories and the
   plastic incineration and recycling rates outside of Europe and the
   United States. Increasing/decreasing the mean lifetimes of all product
   categories by 1 SD changes the cumulative primary plastic waste
   generation (for 1950 to 2015) from 5900 to 4600/6200 Mt or by −4/+5%.
   Increasing/decreasing current global incineration and recycling rates
   by 5%, and adjusting the time trends accordingly, changes the
   cumulative discarded plastic waste from 4900 (for 1950 to 2015) to
   4500/5200 Mt or by −8/+6%.

   The growth of plastics production in the past 65 years has
   substantially outpaced any other manufactured material. The same
   properties that make plastics so versatile in innumerable
   applications—durability and resistance to degradation—make these
   materials difficult or impossible for nature to assimilate. Thus,
   without a well-designed and tailor-made management strategy for
   end-of-life plastics, humans are conducting a singular uncontrolled
   experiment on a global scale, in which billions of metric tons of
   material will accumulate across all major terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems on the planet. The relative advantages and disadvantages of
   dematerialization, substitution, reuse, material recycling,
   waste-to-energy, and conversion technologies must be carefully
   considered to design the best solutions to the environmental challenges
   posed by the enormous and sustained global growth in plastics
   production and use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plastic production

   The starting point of the plastic production model is global annual
   pure polymer (resin) production data from 1950 to 2015, published by
   the Plastics Europe Market Research Group, and global annual fiber
   production data from 1970 to 2015 published by The Fiber Year and
   Tecnon OrbiChem (table S1). The resin data closely follow a
   second-order polynomial time trend, which generated a fit of R^2 =
   0.9968. The fiber data closely follow a third-order polynomial time
   trend, which generated a fit of R^2 = 0.9934. Global breakdowns of
   total production by polymer type and industrial use sector were derived
   from annual market and polymer data for North America, Europe, China,
   and India (table S2) (12, 13, 19–24). U.S. and European data are
   available for 2002 to 2014. Polymer type and industrial use sector
   breakdowns of polymer production are similar across countries and
   regions.

   Global additives production data, which are not publicly available,
   were acquired from market research companies and cross-checked for
   consistency (table S3) (17, 18). Additives data are available for 2000
   to 2014. Polymer type and industrial use sector breakdowns of polymer
   production and the additives to polymer fraction were both stable over
   the time period for which data are available and thus assumed constant
   throughout the modeling period of 1950–2015. Any errors in the early
   decades were mitigated by the lower production rates in those years.
   Additives data were organized by additive type and industrial use
   sector and integrated with the polymer data. P[i] (t) denotes the
   amount of primary plastics (that is, polymers plus additives) produced
   in year t and used in sector i (fig. S1).

Plastic waste generation and fate

   Plastics use was characterized by discretized log-normal distributions,
   LTD[i] (j), which denotes the fraction of plastics in industrial use
   sector i used for j years (Fig. 1). Mean values and SDs were gathered
   from published literature (table S4) (22, 25–29). Product lifetimes may
   vary significantly across economies and also across demographic groups,
   which is why distributions were used and sensitivity analysis was
   conducted with regard to mean product lifetimes. The total amount of
   primary plastic waste generated in year t was calculated as PW (t) =
   Embedded Image Embedded Image (figs. S3 and S4). Secondary plastic
   waste generated in year t was calculated as the fraction of total
   plastic waste that was recycled k years ago, SW (t) = [PW (t − k) + SW
   (t − k)][RR (t − k)], where k is the average use time of secondary
   plastics and RR (t − k) is the global recycling rate in year t − k.
   Amounts of plastic waste discarded and incinerated are calculated as
   DW(t) = [PW(t) + SW(t) ∙ DR(t) and IW(t) = [PW(t) + SW(t)] ∙ IR(t),
   with DR(t) and IR(t) being the global discard and incineration rates in
   year t (fig. S5). Cumulative values at time T were calculated as the
   sum over all T − 1950 years of plastics mass production. Examples are
   cumulative primary production Embedded Image Embedded Image and
   cumulative primary plastic waste generation, Embedded Image Embedded
   Image (Fig. 3).

Recycling, incineration, and discard rates

   Time series for resin, that is, nonfiber recycling, incineration, and
   discard rates were collected separately for four world regions: the
   United States, the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland, China, and the
   rest of the world. Detailed and comprehensive solid waste management
   data for the United States were published by the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency dating back to 1960 (table S7) (34). European data
   were from several reports by PlasticsEurope, which collectively cover
   1996 to 2014 (12, 13, 38). Chinese data were synthesized and reconciled
   from the English version of the China Statistical Yearbook,
   translations of Chinese publications and government reports, and
   additional waste management literature (35, 36, 39–41). Waste
   management for the rest of the world was based on World Bank data (37).
   Time series for global recycling, incineration, and discard rates (fig.
   S5) were derived by adding the rates of the four regions weighted by
   their relative contribution to global plastic waste generation. In many
   world regions, waste management data were sparse and of poor quality.
   For this reason, sensitivity analysis with regard to waste management
   rates was conducted.

   The resulting global nonfiber recycling rate increased at a constant
   0.7% per annum (p.a.) between 1990 and 2014. If this linear trend is
   assumed to continue, the global recycling rate would reach 44% in 2050.
   The global nonfiber incineration rate has grown more unevenly but, on
   average, increased 0.7% p.a. between 1980 and 2014. Assuming an annual
   increase of 0.7% between 2014 and 2050 yielded a global incineration
   rate of 50% by 2050. With those two assumptions, global discard rate
   would decrease from 58% in 2014 to 6% in 2050 (fig. S7). The dashed
   lines in Fig. 3 are based on those assumptions and therefore simply
   forward projections of historical global trends and should not be
   mistaken for a prediction or forecast. There is currently no
   significant recycling of synthetic fibers. It was thus assumed that
   end-of-life textiles are incinerated and discarded together with all
   other municipal solid waste.
