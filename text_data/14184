Cascadia Subduction Zone

   The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) "megathrust" fault is a 1,000 km
   long dipping fault that stretches from Northern Vancouver Island to
   Cape Mendocino California. It separates the Juan de Fuca and North
   America plates. New Juan de Fuca plate is created offshore along the
   Juan de Fuca ridge. The Juan de Fuca plate moves toward, and eventually
   is shoved beneath, the continent (North American plate).

   Cascadia Earthquake Sources


   At depths shallower than 30 km or so, the CSZ is locked by friction
   while strain slowly builds up as the subduction forces act, until the
   fault's frictional strength is exceeded and the rocks slip past each
   other along the fault in a "megathrust" earthquake. The fault's
   frictional properties change with depth, such that immediately below
   the locked part is a strip (the "Transition Zone") that slides in "slow
   slip events" that slip a few cm every dozen months or so. This relieves
   the plate boundary stresses there, but adds to the stress on the locked
   part of the fault. Below the transition zone geodetic evidence suggests
   that the fault slides continuously and silently at long term plate slip
   rate. From its surface trace offshore to a depth of possibly 5 km, all
   remote from land, observations are few and it remains unknown whether
   the fault is stuck or slipping silently.

   Great Subduction Zone earthquakes are the largest earthquakes in the
   world, and are the only source zones that can produce earthquakes
   greater than M8.5. The CSZ has produced magnitude 9.0 or greater
   earthquakes in the past, and undoubtedly will in the future.

   The last known megathrust earthquake in the northwest was in January,
   1700, just over 300 years ago. Geological evidence indicates that such
   great earthquakes have occurred at least seven times in the last 3,500
   years, a return interval of 400 to 600 years. To learn more about the
   history of the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the science that led to the
   discovery of it, delve into land level changes and turbidites created
   by the CSZ earthquakes. For more about the Cascadia Subduction Zone,
   visit the USGS webpage discussing this topic.

   The CSZ may be unique among the worlds subduction zones in that it
   produces very few (if any) earthquakes unambiguously on the plate
   interface. Coupled with evident occurrence of great megathrust
   earthquakes, the CSZ must be much more strongly locked than other
   subduction faults. The geological evidence has led to different
   interpretrations, moreover, about whether the entire CSZ always
   ruptures in great M9 earthquakes, or whether smaller M8 or M8.5-sized
   events also can break parts of the zone in between the full rupture
   events.

   The M9 Project, a University of Washington-based research group, has
   been producing research on Cascadia Subduction Zone hazards and effects
   of large earthquakes in the Paciifc Northwest since 2015. For their
   most recent publications and news, visit their website.
