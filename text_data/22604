   Presentation Lutece Langue 2019

Learn French in Paris,
French language school in France

   We don’t believe that language learning is just about studying grammar
   notions and vocabulary. We do believe, however, that the goal of
   language learning is to better “communicate” and that grammar and
   vocabulary are vital TOOLS for communication. Learn French in Paris
   with LUTECE LANGUE, focusing on ORAL COMMUNICATION skills in small
   groups of 2-7 students!

French courses in small groups

   Learn French in Paris, in our new location:
   6 rue Las Cases 75007 PARIS,
   Metro Solférino, RER Musée d’Orsay

   LUTECE LANGUE is a French language school in Paris established for more
   than 20 years. We offer a wide range of French language courses of all
   levels, for professional and personal use. Our aim is to provide a
   personalized teaching and we do this by keeping our classes small.
   Join our French classes any week throughout year (except total
   beginners), from 1 week to 1 year !

#1: Returning students confirm the quality of our French courses

   When you search for a French language school online, it’s hard to
   determine the quality of the courses on offer. Here at Lutece Langue,
   we have been providing high-quality French language courses since 1997.
   More than 40% of our students return to us to further their studies and
   develop their French language skills. Take a look at comments on
   FACEBOOK to see what our students think of our services!

#2: Personalized attention and teaching for every student

   It is difficult to learn a language in a large class. To avoid this
   problem, we limit our class size. Each student receives a personalized
   teaching plan and can play an active role in classes.

#3: Student-oriented teaching approach

   In a large school, a student can get lost in the crowd. Teachers find
   it hard in a large class to provide the necessary individual
   instruction and help. We run a small French language school and as a
   result, we can treat every student like a family member. Our teachers
   not only provide each student with personalized education, but they
   also get to know each student individually so that they can easily
   monitor their progress.
   Lutece Langue, Student oriented Teaching approach
   Lutece Langue, Flexibility in class curriculum

#4: Flexibility in-class curriculum

   In many schools, teachers are bound by the curriculum set by the school
   board. Teachers that lack flexibility also struggles to personalize the
   course to meet students’ needs. Students should not have to adapt to
   their teachers. It should be the other way round. LUTECE LANGUE
   teachers are able to choose the teaching materials that meet their
   students’ needs and requirements.

Cookies policy of lutece-langue.com

   In accordance with Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and
   of the Council of 12 July 2002, LUTECE LANGUE (hereinafter “COMPANY” or
   “we”) informs you that lutece-langue.com (hereinafter “site” or “Web
   site”) uses cookies to store information on your computer, required to
   access some of its features. By using the site, you declare you have
   read and you agree to this Cookies Policy as well as the Terms and
   Conditions of use of the Website.

I – Definition of “Cookies”

   Cookies are small text files loaded to your computer or smart phone
   when you use some Web sites, computer programs or mobile applications
   (“sites”, in general). They store information needed by these sites to
   provide you with their services, improve navigation, remember your
   preferences, run advertising campaigns, etc. Read more about cookies in
   Wikipedia or on the site of the European Commission.

II – Classification of Cookies

   There are three classes of cookies, and the same cookie can receive
   different classifications, depending on how it is created and used.
   Please note these categories are not always standard, and other sites
   may use different classifications.

II.1 – According the duration of the cookie

   Session cookies: Only last during a browsing session, and are removed
   the moment the browser window is closed. Session cookies are used for
   technical functionalities, for example to remember what products have
   been added to a shopping basket.

   Persistent cookies: They are stored on users’ devices after the browser
   window has been closed. The duration of this type of cookie is set by
   the website that created it, and it can last for an indefinite period
   of time. They are commonly used to remember your navigation preferences
   during future visits or for targeted advertising. The intrusiveness of
   this type of cookie depends on if it is used by the same site, or a
   third party site, and what it is used for.

II.2 – According the cookie origin

   First party cookies: The website that sets the cookie is the same
   website the user is visiting.

   Third party cookies: The cookie is created by a website other than the
   one being visited, collecting information to provide visitors with
   their own services or track users on the third-party site.

II.3 – According the cookie usage

   Technical Cookies: Allow the user to navigate through a site and use
   any of its existing options or services, for example, identify the
   session (1-a), restrict access to some pages, serve content according
   the visitors’ languages, remember the elements of an order, complete
   the checkout of a shopping cart, use a password protected page, set
   security features, manage videos or music, or share content via social
   networks. Some technical cookies are considered “strictly necessary
   cookies”, because the site could not work without them.

   Customization Cookies: Allow users to personalize the functioning of a
   website (such as languages, colors, country, etc).

   Analytical Cookies: Monitors the behavior of users on a website,
   generating statistics that can be used later to define marketing
   strategies, provide users with custom information, and improve services
   and content.

   Advertising Cookies: Used for more effective management of advertising
   spaces on the site.

   Targeting Cookies: Stores information about users’ behaviors through
   the continuous observation of their browsing habits, sometime across
   multiple sites. In this case, they used to be known as “Super Cookies”.
   These are usually created by third-party sites offering some kind of
   service in return, like social networks and email services. Super
   cookies are the most likely to offer risks to users, both in regards to
   their privacy and to the security of their computers. For this reason,
   it is important you know what services or websites store these types of
   cookies, and decide how to manage them.

IV – How to manage cookies

   We strongly recommend you to use DoNotTrack, after installing a

   some targeting cookies are processed by your browser. Read more in

V – Security habits

   Although we make our best efforts to inform you about cookies and our
   policies, you are ultimately responsible for your own privacy and
   security. Only by learning more about your rights and the Internet in
   general, and acquiring safe, “common-sense” navigation habits, will you
   be able to protect yourself and get the most the Internet has to offer.
