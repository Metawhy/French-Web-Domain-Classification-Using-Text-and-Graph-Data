Banknotes and coins circulation

   The statistics referenced on this page are updated around the 14th
   working day of each month. They cover
     * data on outstanding amounts (stocks) of euro banknotes and coins in
       circulation
     * transactions data (flows) on the banknotes and coins issued into
       circulation, returned from circulation, sorted to check
       authenticity & fitness and sorted to unfit during the reporting
       period
     * the number of NCBs/commercial banks branches providing cash in the
       euro area
     * the value of euro collector coins not intended for circulation
       issued by the euro area Member States.

   The main aggregates for these statistics are shown on this page. More
   data are available through the Statistical Data Warehouse (see below).

   statistics" and those for "currency in circulation" on the aggregated
   balance sheet of the monetary and financial institutions (MFI) sector.

   The difference, which amounts to approximately 0.2% in terms of the
   total issuance, is largely due to the different ways collector coins
   are treated in participating Member States. In addition, differences
   can be seen in the data for the year 2002 and for the months after each
   euro area enlargement. Here, discrepancies between the two sets of
   figures are largely due to legacy currencies being included in the
   category “currency in circulation”.

   Euro collector coins are by definition not intended for circulation and
   only have legal tender status in the country of issue. Therefore, they
   are excluded from the banknotes statistics figures for "net circulation
   of banknotes and coins" but are included, at least by some
   participating Member States, in the monetary statistics figures for
   “currency in circulation”. In banknotes and coins statistics,
   information on euro collector coins is contained in a separate series
   called “collector coins issued net of collector coins returned”.

   * Collector coins not intended for circulation have legal tender status
   only in the country of issue and are not produced for the purpose of
   being used as a means of payment. They must be easily distinguishable
   from euro circulation coins, which include normal coins and
   commemorative coins.

   As regards the MFI consolidated balance sheet, the figure for “net
   circulation of banknotes and coins” in the banknotes and coins
   statistics differs more significantly from the monetary statistics
   figure for “currency in circulation”. This is because “currency in
   circulation” as presented in the MFI consolidated balance sheet only
   refers to banknotes and coins circulating outside the MFI sector.
   “Vault cash”, i.e. currency held by MFIs in order to meet day-to-day
   business needs, is not included in the consolidated figure.

   Monthly monetary statistics on currency in circulation are published in
   the ECB’s Statistics Bulletin (Tables 2.1 and 2.2 in the euro area
   statistics section). For interactive data access see the relevant
   reports in the SDW:

Glossary of terms

Net circulation of banknotes and coins

   The number and value of euro banknotes issued by the Eurosystem central
   banks, without further distinction as to who is holding the currency
   issued, i.e. also including the stocks held by credit institutions.

Collector coins issued net of collector coins returned

   The total face value of all euro collector coins, which are defined as
   coins not intended for circulation. Euro collector coins have legal
   tender status only in the country of issue. They must be readily
   distinguishable from euro circulation coins. Official definitions of
   “euro circulation coins” and “euro collector coins” can be found in the
   Official Journal of the European Union (OJ C 247, 15.10.2003, p.5).

Banknotes and coins returned from circulation

   The number and value of banknotes and coins returned to the reporting
   national central bank (NCB) during the reporting period.

Banknotes and coins sorted to check authenticity & fitness

   The number and value of banknotes checked for authenticity and fitness
   by the reporting NCB, either using banknote sorting machines or
   manually, during the reporting period.

Sorted to unfit

   The number and value of banknotes found to be unfit, and thus withdrawn
   from circulation, during the reporting period.

Banknotes series

   The design series of euro banknotes issued by the Eurosystem central
   banks.

   Figures for “banknotes returned from circulation” and “net circulation
   of banknotes” split by design series (first series and Europa series)
   are estimates.

   payment services and terminals by the public, as well as volumes and
   values of transactions processed through payment systems. Statistics
   are published for each EU Member State, in addition to EU and euro area
   aggregates and comparative data.

Payment services^[1]

   The total number of non-cash payments in the EU, comprising all types
   of payment services^[2], increased by 7.9% to 134.0 billion in 2017
   compared with the previous year. Card payments accounted for 52% of all
   transactions, while credit transfers accounted for 24% and direct
   debits for 19%.

   The number of credit transfers within the EU increased in 2017 by 5.5%
   to 32.1 billion. The importance of paper-based transactions continued
   to decrease, with the ratio of paper-based transactions to transactions
   initiated electronically standing at around one to ten.

   The number of cards with a payment function in the EU increased in 2017
   by 2.0% to 812 million. With a total EU population of 513 million, this
   represented around 1.6 payment cards per EU inhabitant. The number of
   card transactions rose by 11.2% to 69.2 billion, with a total value of
   €3.1 trillion. This corresponds to an average value of around €44 per
   card transaction. Chart 1 below shows the use of the main payment
   services from 2000 to 2017.

   The relative importance of each of the main payment services continued
   to vary widely across EU countries in 2017 (see Annex).

   In 2017, the total number of automated teller machines (ATMs) in the EU
   decreased by 1.0% to 0.43 million, while the number of point of sale
   (POS) terminals increased by 9.9% to 13.5 million.

   Note: Data have been partially estimated for periods prior to 2010, as
   methodological changes were implemented in previous years and some
   corresponding data are not available. The historical estimation done by
   the ECB ensures comparability of figures over the entire period.
   Statistics are also collected on e-money payments and other payment
   services, which accounted for 3.7% of the total number of EU
   transactions in 2017.

Retail payment systems

   Retail payment systems in the EU handle mainly payments that are made
   by the public, with a relatively low value, high volume, and limited
   time-criticality.

   In 2017, 43 retail payment systems existed within the EU as a whole.
   During the year, around 57 billion transactions were processed by those
   systems with an amount of €44.0 trillion. 22 of these systems were
   located in the euro area, where they processed almost 42 billion
   transactions in 2017 (i.e. 73% of the EU total) with a value amounting
   to €31.6 trillion (i.e. 72% of the EU total).^[3]

   There continues to be a notable degree of concentration in EU retail
   payment systems in 2017. The four largest systems in terms of number of
   transactions (CORE in France, STEP2^[4], BACS in the United Kingdom and
   RPS in Germany) processed 60% of the volume and 64% of the value of all
   transactions processed by EU retail payment systems. Chart 2 shows the
   number and value of transactions processed by EU retail payment systems
   in 2017.

Large-value payment systems

   Large-value payment systems (LVPSs) are designed primarily to process
   urgent or large-value interbank payments, but some of them also settle
   a large number of retail payments. During 2017, 12 systems settled 842
   million payments with a total value of €702 trillion in the EU.^[5] The
   two main LVPSs in the euro area (TARGET2 and EURO1/STEP1)^[6] settled
   143 million transactions amounting to €528 trillion in 2017, i.e. 75%
   of the total value. In the non-euro area EU countries, CHAPS
   Sterling^[7] in the United Kingdom is the largest LVPS in terms of
   value and number of transactions.

   Outside the EU, Continuous Linked Settlement^[8] (CLS) is the most
   important large value payment system processing, inter alia, euro and
   other EU currencies. CLS (all currencies) settled 198 million
   transactions with a value of €1193 trillion in 2017. Chart 3 below
   shows the number and value of transactions processed by LVPSs in 2017.

   systems.

Notes:

     * The full set of payment statistics can be downloaded from the
       Statistical Data Warehouse (SDW). The "Reports" section of the SDW
       also contains pre-formatted tables with payment statistics for the
       last five years. The data are presented in the same format as in
       the former "Blue Book Addendum". For detailed methodological
       information, including a list of all data definitions, please refer
       to the "Statistics" section of the ECB's website.
     * As a result of the progressive implementation of the Single Euro
       Payments Area (SEPA) and other developments in the payments market
       in Europe, the methodological and reporting framework for payments
       statistics has been enhanced as of the reference year 2014. The new
       requirements are laid down in the Regulation on payments statistics
       (ECB/2013/43) and in the Guideline on monetary and financial
       statistics (recast) (ECB/2014/15). A background note, available on
       the ECB's website, describes the changes in more detail.
     * In addition to annual payments statistics for 2017, this press
       release incorporates minor revisions to data for previous periods.
       The hyperlinks in the press release are dynamic; thus, the data
       might slightly change with the next annual release due to
       revisions. Unless otherwise indicated, statistics referring to euro
       area cover the EU Member States that had adopted the euro at the
       time to which the data relate.

   ^[1]SEPA instruments are included in the respective categories.
   Information on the SEPA instruments can be found on the ECB's website
   (http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/sepa/html/index.en.html).
   ^[2]Including credit transfers, direct debits, card payments with cards
   issued by resident payment service providers, e-money payments, cheques
   and other payment services.
   ^[3]The figures for one Cypriot payment system are excluded from the
   euro area and EU aggregates due to confidentiality.
   ^[4]STEP2 is a pan-European automated clearing house for retail
   payments in euro operated by EBA CLEARING.
   ^[5]Among the LVPSs that also process retail payments, CERTIS - a Czech
   Republic system - is the main contributor in terms of number of
   transactions to the EU aggregate figure, with 603 million. In terms of
   value, CERTIS settled €17.4 trillion during 2016.
   ^[6]TARGET2 is the second-generation Trans-European Automated Real-time
   Gross settlement Express Transfer system. It is operated by the
   Eurosystem and settles payments in euro in central bank money.
   EURO1/STEP1 is an EU-wide multilateral net large-value payment system
   for euro payments operated by EBA CLEARING. Payments are processed in
   EURO1 throughout the day and final balances are settled at the end of
   the day in TARGET2.
   ^[7]CHAPS Sterling handles sterling-denominated interbank payments and
   it settled 39 million transactions amounting to €92.2 trillion in 2016.
   ^[8]CLS is a worldwide clearing and settlement system that settles FX
   transactions on a payment-versus-payment basis.

       How to stabilise the euro area
       We need more supportive fiscal policy alongside monetary policy for
       a faster return to price stability with fewer side effects, says
       President Mario Draghi in Greece. Acting too late leads to a longer
       period of accommodative policies.

Banknotes and coins circulation

   The statistics referenced on this page are updated around the 14th
   working day of each month. They cover
     * data on outstanding amounts (stocks) of euro banknotes and coins in
       circulation
     * transactions data (flows) on the banknotes and coins issued into
       circulation, returned from circulation, sorted to check
       authenticity & fitness and sorted to unfit during the reporting
       period
     * the number of NCBs/commercial banks branches providing cash in the
       euro area
     * the value of euro collector coins not intended for circulation
       issued by the euro area Member States.

   The main aggregates for these statistics are shown on this page. More
   data are available through the Statistical Data Warehouse (see below).
   Data are not seasonally adjusted.

   The ECB closely monitors the stock and circulation of euro banknotes
   and coins. It is the Eurosystem’s task to ensure a smooth and efficient
   supply of euro banknotes and to maintain their integrity.

Background

Differences between “banknotes and coins statistics” and “monetary
statistics’’

   A difference can be seen below between the figures for the "net
   circulation of banknotes and coins" under "banknotes and coins
   statistics" and those for "currency in circulation" on the aggregated
   balance sheet of the monetary and financial institutions (MFI) sector.

   The difference, which amounts to approximately 0.2% in terms of the
   total issuance, is largely due to the different ways collector coins
   are treated in participating Member States. In addition, differences
   can be seen in the data for the year 2002 and for the months after each
   euro area enlargement. Here, discrepancies between the two sets of
   figures are largely due to legacy currencies being included in the
   category “currency in circulation”.

   Euro collector coins are by definition not intended for circulation and
   only have legal tender status in the country of issue. Therefore, they
   are excluded from the banknotes statistics figures for "net circulation
   of banknotes and coins" but are included, at least by some
   participating Member States, in the monetary statistics figures for
   “currency in circulation”. In banknotes and coins statistics,
   information on euro collector coins is contained in a separate series
   called “collector coins issued net of collector coins returned”.

   CAPTION: Differences between “banknotes and coins statistics” and
   “monetary statistics”
   (All figures in EUR millions)

   Year Banknotes and coins statistics Monetary statistics Difference
   between (1) and (3)
     Net circulation of banknotes and coins (1) Collector coins issued net
   of collector coins returned (*) (2) Currency in circulation (3)
   (MFI aggregated balance sheet)
   2015 1,109,442 3,523 1,111,806 -2,363
   2016 1,153,155 3,776 1,155,399 -2,244

   * Collector coins not intended for circulation have legal tender status
   only in the country of issue and are not produced for the purpose of
   being used as a means of payment. They must be easily distinguishable
   from euro circulation coins, which include normal coins and
   commemorative coins.

   As regards the MFI consolidated balance sheet, the figure for “net
   circulation of banknotes and coins” in the banknotes and coins
   statistics differs more significantly from the monetary statistics
   figure for “currency in circulation”. This is because “currency in
   circulation” as presented in the MFI consolidated balance sheet only
   refers to banknotes and coins circulating outside the MFI sector.
   “Vault cash”, i.e. currency held by MFIs in order to meet day-to-day
   business needs, is not included in the consolidated figure.

   Monthly monetary statistics on currency in circulation are published in
   the ECB’s Statistics Bulletin (Tables 2.1 and 2.2 in the euro area
   statistics section). For interactive data access see the relevant
   reports in the SDW:

Glossary of terms

Net circulation of banknotes and coins

   The number and value of euro banknotes issued by the Eurosystem central
   banks, without further distinction as to who is holding the currency
   issued, i.e. also including the stocks held by credit institutions.

Collector coins issued net of collector coins returned

   The total face value of all euro collector coins, which are defined as
   coins not intended for circulation. Euro collector coins have legal
   tender status only in the country of issue. They must be readily
   distinguishable from euro circulation coins. Official definitions of
   “euro circulation coins” and “euro collector coins” can be found in the
   Official Journal of the European Union (OJ C 247, 15.10.2003, p.5).

Banknotes and coins returned from circulation

   The number and value of banknotes and coins returned to the reporting
   national central bank (NCB) during the reporting period.

Banknotes and coins sorted to check authenticity & fitness

   The number and value of banknotes checked for authenticity and fitness
   by the reporting NCB, either using banknote sorting machines or
   manually, during the reporting period.

Sorted to unfit

   The number and value of banknotes found to be unfit, and thus withdrawn
   from circulation, during the reporting period.

Banknotes series

   The design series of euro banknotes issued by the Eurosystem central
   banks.

   Figures for “banknotes returned from circulation” and “net circulation
   of banknotes” split by design series (first series and Europa series)
   are estimates.

   card transactions rose by 11.2% to 69.2 billion, with a total value of
   €3.1 trillion. This corresponds to an average value of around €44 per
   card transaction. Chart 1 below shows the use of the main payment
   services from 2000 to 2017.

   The relative importance of each of the main payment services continued
   to vary widely across EU countries in 2017 (see Annex).

   In 2017, the total number of automated teller machines (ATMs) in the EU
   decreased by 1.0% to 0.43 million, while the number of point of sale
   (POS) terminals increased by 9.9% to 13.5 million.

   Note: Data have been partially estimated for periods prior to 2010, as
   methodological changes were implemented in previous years and some
   corresponding data are not available. The historical estimation done by
   the ECB ensures comparability of figures over the entire period.
   Statistics are also collected on e-money payments and other payment
   services, which accounted for 3.7% of the total number of EU
   transactions in 2017.

Retail payment systems

   Retail payment systems in the EU handle mainly payments that are made
   by the public, with a relatively low value, high volume, and limited
   time-criticality.

   In 2017, 43 retail payment systems existed within the EU as a whole.
   During the year, around 57 billion transactions were processed by those
   systems with an amount of €44.0 trillion. 22 of these systems were
   located in the euro area, where they processed almost 42 billion
   transactions in 2017 (i.e. 73% of the EU total) with a value amounting
   to €31.6 trillion (i.e. 72% of the EU total).^[3]

   There continues to be a notable degree of concentration in EU retail
   payment systems in 2017. The four largest systems in terms of number of
   transactions (CORE in France, STEP2^[4], BACS in the United Kingdom and
   RPS in Germany) processed 60% of the volume and 64% of the value of all
   transactions processed by EU retail payment systems. Chart 2 shows the
   number and value of transactions processed by EU retail payment systems
   in 2017.

Large-value payment systems

   Large-value payment systems (LVPSs) are designed primarily to process
   urgent or large-value interbank payments, but some of them also settle
   a large number of retail payments. During 2017, 12 systems settled 842
   million payments with a total value of €702 trillion in the EU.^[5] The
   two main LVPSs in the euro area (TARGET2 and EURO1/STEP1)^[6] settled
   143 million transactions amounting to €528 trillion in 2017, i.e. 75%
   of the total value. In the non-euro area EU countries, CHAPS
   Sterling^[7] in the United Kingdom is the largest LVPS in terms of
   value and number of transactions.

   Outside the EU, Continuous Linked Settlement^[8] (CLS) is the most
   important large value payment system processing, inter alia, euro and
   other EU currencies. CLS (all currencies) settled 198 million
   transactions with a value of €1193 trillion in 2017. Chart 3 below
   shows the number and value of transactions processed by LVPSs in 2017.

       (2017)

Notes:

     * The full set of payment statistics can be downloaded from the
       Statistical Data Warehouse (SDW). The "Reports" section of the SDW
       also contains pre-formatted tables with payment statistics for the
       last five years. The data are presented in the same format as in
       the former "Blue Book Addendum". For detailed methodological
       information, including a list of all data definitions, please refer
       to the "Statistics" section of the ECB's website.
     * As a result of the progressive implementation of the Single Euro
       Payments Area (SEPA) and other developments in the payments market
       in Europe, the methodological and reporting framework for payments
       statistics has been enhanced as of the reference year 2014. The new
       requirements are laid down in the Regulation on payments statistics
       (ECB/2013/43) and in the Guideline on monetary and financial
       statistics (recast) (ECB/2014/15). A background note, available on
       the ECB's website, describes the changes in more detail.
     * In addition to annual payments statistics for 2017, this press
       release incorporates minor revisions to data for previous periods.
       The hyperlinks in the press release are dynamic; thus, the data
       might slightly change with the next annual release due to
       revisions. Unless otherwise indicated, statistics referring to euro
       area cover the EU Member States that had adopted the euro at the
       time to which the data relate.

   ^[1]SEPA instruments are included in the respective categories.
   Information on the SEPA instruments can be found on the ECB's website
   (http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/sepa/html/index.en.html).
   ^[2]Including credit transfers, direct debits, card payments with cards
   issued by resident payment service providers, e-money payments, cheques
   and other payment services.
   ^[3]The figures for one Cypriot payment system are excluded from the
   euro area and EU aggregates due to confidentiality.
   ^[4]STEP2 is a pan-European automated clearing house for retail
   payments in euro operated by EBA CLEARING.
   ^[5]Among the LVPSs that also process retail payments, CERTIS - a Czech
   Republic system - is the main contributor in terms of number of
   transactions to the EU aggregate figure, with 603 million. In terms of
   value, CERTIS settled €17.4 trillion during 2016.
   ^[6]TARGET2 is the second-generation Trans-European Automated Real-time
   Gross settlement Express Transfer system. It is operated by the
   Eurosystem and settles payments in euro in central bank money.
   EURO1/STEP1 is an EU-wide multilateral net large-value payment system
   for euro payments operated by EBA CLEARING. Payments are processed in
   EURO1 throughout the day and final balances are settled at the end of
   the day in TARGET2.
   ^[7]CHAPS Sterling handles sterling-denominated interbank payments and
   it settled 39 million transactions amounting to €92.2 trillion in 2016.
   ^[8]CLS is a worldwide clearing and settlement system that settles FX
   transactions on a payment-versus-payment basis.

       How to stabilise the euro area
       We need more supportive fiscal policy alongside monetary policy for
       a faster return to price stability with fewer side effects, says
       President Mario Draghi in Greece. Acting too late leads to a longer
       period of accommodative policies.
