Music made easy

Running a business takes time.
Playing great music shouldn’t.

Plan your music week before it starts

Schedule your different soundtracks throughout the day to match the changing
mood & tempo of your business.

No hardware needed

Most of our competitors make you buy a clunky music streaming box. We’ve
built a super easy-to-use app instead - free of charge.

Convert your playlists into soundtracks

Turn your Spotify playlists into non-repetitive soundtracks. We automatically
add more songs that match the vibe and update it weekly.

Never worry about licensing again

Unlike consumer services, Soundtrack is licensed for business. In the U.S.,
ASCAP and BMI are all included.

“Soundtrack is great because it makes music so easy. We press play and
everything is taken care of.”

   Laura
   Manager at Albuquerque Press Club
   Albuquerque, New Mexico

“We went with Soundtrack because of its ability to import playlists through
Spotify.”

   Mallory
   Marketing manager for Frogtown Brewery
   Los Angeles, California

“We love Soundtrack because of its unique scheduling features.”
