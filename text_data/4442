   Popular How To’s

   Some of my tutorials are applicable for a variety of different home
   decor projects. Learn the easy techniques and use them over and over
   again in your home. You’ll be surprised at how realistic some of the
   faux finishes are. For instance, you can create the look of birch bark
   just by using paint. Or, if you don’t want to use actual old book pages
   for crafts, create your own authentic looking pages. You can also give
   the look of galvanized metal to almost anything, including wood.
