The Bullied Chimpanzees

   Posted on June 29, 2016 Categories: Chimp profiles, News No comments

My Name is Cindy

   Being bullied is very bad even when you are a chimpanzee. My name is
   Cindy and I am a Chimpanzee that was once bullied. In the beginning it
   was very terrifying, facing the bully a lone was frightening, it was
   crippling just to walk out of the holding facility to the forest.

   I feared eating when other older Chimpanzees stood next to me.
   Sometimes they would grab my food and eat it and other days they threw
   me out of the hammock at night just for a good days tease.

   I was miserable, young and had no one to stand up for me so one day as
   the bully took my food, I was aided by the goddess of anger and I
   attacked Robbie with a force I had never experienced before.

   Now Robbie at the time was no ordinary Chimpanzee, he was the Alpha
   Male, precisely the President of our community. I don’t know what got
   over me but when I attacked him, he surrendered and gave me back my
   jack fruit.

   That’s how I managed to gain some respect in my community and made some
   friends of my own like Sally, Becky, Nagoti and Bahati. It felt so good
   that all of a sudden I had ultimately become one of the cool kids and
   as luck would have it, I was able to foster a baby Chimpanzee called
   Baluku.

   Baluku arrived at Ngamba in 2001. That boy was a real joy. His presence
   in my life alone took me further in my rank because he became one extra
   person I had to protect at the Island.

   I have loved him and he me. It just makes my life so full and complete.
   I have a son too; it makes me feel like a grandmother already.

   Thinking about visiting Ngamba Island lately, I think now is the time
   to make that decision.
