Welcome Back to The Craft House!

   Well, hello there guys. It's me, Jenni! I'm still alive! How about we
   skip the sappy, "I missed you," stuff and get down to business, shall
   we?
   Somehow, even after two years of neglect, this blog is still receiving
   thousands of page views! Can anyone explain that to me? I figured it
   was time that I get back to the drawing board and see what I could do
   to clean up the page and give it a grand reopening.
   What exactly I'll be doing with it, I'm not quite sure yet. I know that
   I'll continue the PoTW, that was always a popular feature. A layout
   overhaul, perhaps?
   I don't know. At any rate, I missed you guys! I'll see you soon.
