Built on solid foundations

   Textpattern CMS is completely free, open source software and it's built
   upon proven web technologies too. Furthermore, it doesn’t muddy your
   HTML with additional code dependencies or script libraries.

Flexible tag-based templates

   Your designs—your code. Textpattern has a powerful tag-based template
   language that’s easy to learn and provides a wealth of ways to
   structure a website and manipulate content.

Fast, lean, secure and extendable

   We purposefully keep the core of the CMS lean and responsive. However
   the system is fully extendable via plugins, of which there are hundreds
   available via our community of plugin authors.

Simple, elegant user interface

   Our design philosophy extends to the Textpattern core user interface
   too. We try to avoid needless clutter within the administration panels
   and we strive to make the interface fully accessible for all users.

Available in over 40 languages

   The Textpattern core user interface has been localized into many
   languages. Of course, we always welcome further translation by the
   community. More translations are added all the time!

Community-driven development

   Well over a decade of development has been lovingly poured into our
   CMS. The active, friendly and helpful community surrounding the
   platform ensures its continued success and guides its future.

Write using Textile, Markdown, etc.

   Our CMS ships with built-in support for Textile text formatting
   language, and support for Markdown language via a plugin.
   Alternatively, you can write plain text or vanilla HTML if you so wish.

Contributors are welcomed

   Textpattern is open source under the GNU General Public License v2.0,
   and all development takes place on GitHub. User contributions are
   welcome (and indeed, are enthusiastically encouraged).
