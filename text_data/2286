Food

   Food means a lot to us at goop. Whether you’re a passionate cook or a
   non-chef in need of an easy sheet-pan dinner on a busy weeknight, or
   you’ve decided to try a full-on healthy detox, we’ve got all kinds of
   recipes, ideas, videos, and even shopping lists to make your time in
   the kitchen as easy, fun, and (for the most part) healthy as possible.
   We’ll help you plan your week with kid-friendly recipes, one-pot meals,
   healthy slow-cooker ideas, packable lunch ideas, ingredient guides, and
   even shopping lists. We’ll get you going for your chicest dinner party
   with epic cocktails, incredible food, and tons of inspiration. Check
   out our videos and you’ll see Gwyneth Paltrow in action, cooking with
   some of her favorite people; there are also brilliant cooking tutorials
   and how-to videos.
   We love vegan, gluten-free, keto, and paleo options (especially
   cleaned-up comfort food), but we’re equally fond of…fries, so whatever
   food it is you crave, we’ve got the recipes, guides, hacks, tips, and
   expert advice to both support and inspire you.
