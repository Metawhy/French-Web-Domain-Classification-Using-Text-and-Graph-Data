Happy users

   It's exactly what I expected. Very suitable voice. Short, very relevant
   introduction before each meditation. Great support to get you motivated
   every day.

   This app was recommended to me by a colleague because I'd tried several
   times to meditate on my own without success. It makes it easy to get
   started. I began to feel the benefits after only a few days. The
   subscription offers a range of themes: for children, time-related
   stress management etc. Highly recommended.

   Juliette

   Petit BamBou is more than just an application. It's incredible. I was
   very stressed and couldn't recognize my emotions. I'm working towards
   my driver's license. I'm more relaxed now. THANK YOU Petit BamBou.
