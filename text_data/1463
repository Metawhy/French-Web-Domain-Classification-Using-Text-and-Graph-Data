Intel Expands 10th Gen Intel Core Mobile Processor Family, Offering Double
Digit Performance Gains

   family ci3i7i5 10thgen rgb 3000 retail Intel Corporation in August 2019
   introduced eight 10th Gen Intel Core processors for modern laptop
   computing. The new mobile PC processors (formerly code-named “Comet
   Lake”) are tailor-made to deliver increased productivity and
   performance scaling for demanding, multithreaded workloads while still
   enabling thin-and-light laptop and 2 in 1 designs. (Credit: Intel

   What’s New: Today, Intel introduced eight additional 10th Gen Intel®
   Core™ processors for modern laptop computing. The new mobile PC
   processors (formerly code-named “Comet Lake”) are tailor-made to
   deliver increased productivity and performance scaling for demanding,
   multithreaded workloads while still enabling thin-and-light laptop and
   2 in 1 designs with uncompromising battery life^1. These processors are
   performance powerhouses that bring double digit performance gains
   compared with the previous generation^2. The lineup also includes
   Intel’s first 6-core processor in the U-series, faster CPU frequencies,
   faster memory interfaces and the industry redefining connectivity with
   Intel® Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) and broader scaling of Thunderbolt™ 3. More than
   90 additional designs based on the 10th Gen Intel Core processor family
   will hit the shelves for the holiday season.

     “Our 10th Gen Intel Core mobile processors provide customers with
     the industry-leading range of products that deliver the best balance
     of performance, features, power and design for their specific needs.
     From multitasking to everyday content creation, the newest additions
     to the family scale performance for even higher levels of
     productivity — in addition to offering best-in-class platform
     connectivity via Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) and Thunderbolt 3 that people expect
     with 10th Gen.”
     –Chris Walker, Intel corporate vice president and general manager of
     Mobility Client Platforms in the Client Computing Group

   Why It Matters: Taking advantage of Intel’s world-class portfolio of
   technologies and intellectual property, the 10th Gen Intel Core
   processor family delivers a range of workload-optimized platforms to
   address diverse computing needs and experiences. The new 10th Gen Intel
   Core processors leverage the improvements in intra-node optimizations
   on Intel’s highly optimized 14nm process technology that enable up to
   16% overall performance gains^2 and over 41% better productivity and
   multitasking on Microsoft Office 365* compared with the previous
   generation^3 — all without compromising battery life^1. Additionally,
   they integrate the best wireless connectivity with Intel WiFi6
   (Gig+)^4 and support Thunderbolt 3, the fastest and most versatile port
   available^5.

   Earlier this month, Intel launched the first products in 10th Gen Intel
   Core processor family, which were developed on the 10nm process
   technology and focus on bringing high-performance artificial
   intelligence (AI) to the PC at scale, a big leap forward in graphics
   performance and best-in-class connectivity. The new processors
   introduced today share the same leading platform connectivity, while
   expanding the family with processors for scaling performance and
   frequencies for modern productivity workloads. The result is a complete
   family of processors that complement each other, giving people choices
   for what usages matter most to them and re-imagining the possibilities
   of a modern laptop experience.

   What They Feature:

   The new 10th Gen Intel Core processors range from Intel Core i3 to
   Intel Core i7 and feature:
     * Up to 6 cores and 12 threads
     * Up to 4.9 GHz max turbo frequency
     * Up to 12MB Intel Smart Cache
     * Configurable up to 25W for maximum performance (U-series)
     * Configurable down to 4.5W for 4-core fanless designs (Y-series)
     * Up to 1.15 GHz graphics frequency
     * LPDDR4x, LPDDR3, DDR4 memory speed increase to 2666 MT/s

   People can also expect the same great connectivity across the entire
   10th Gen Intel Core processor family. Integrated Intel Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+)
   brings enhanced WPA3 security for additional peace of mind and is
   nearly 3 times faster^6 to enable quick file downloads and more
   responsive performance throughout the home. Systems with these
   processors also support Thunderbolt 3 controllers enabling up to four
   Thunderbolt 3 ports, each capable of delivering power, download speeds
   of 40 Gb/s and connecting to the thousands of docks, displays and
   peripherals in the market, all via a single cable.

   Finally, the new processors scale the number of designs optimized
   with Intel® Adaptix™ Technology, supporting modern standby for faster
   wake and enabling multiple voice assistant services built into the PCs.
   Within Intel Adaptix Technology, Intel® Dynamic Tuning Technology
   enables OEM partners to tune 10th Gen Intel Core processor-based
   systems to achieve even more performance — ranging from 8% to 12% on a
   typical system^7. On select designs, Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology
   now offers the first ever AI-based pre-trained algorithms to predict
   workloads and allow higher turbo burst when responsiveness is needed
   and extended time in turbo for sustained workloads.

   How to Get Them: Laptops and 2 in 1s powered by the new 10th Gen Intel
   Core processors will be available from PC manufacturers for the holiday
   season. Select systems from PC manufacturers based on 10th Gen Intel
   Core processors are on track for verification through Intel’s
   innovation program code-named “Project Athena.” Look for the
   “Engineered for Mobile Performance” signage online and in retail stores
   this fall for the best of 10th Gen Intel Core processor-based systems
   from PC manufacturers.

Intel Expands 10th Gen Intel Core Mobile Processor Family, Offering Double
Digit Performance Gains

   family ci3i7i5 10thgen rgb 3000 retail Intel Corporation in August 2019
   introduced eight 10th Gen Intel Core processors for modern laptop
   computing. The new mobile PC processors (formerly code-named “Comet
   Lake”) are tailor-made to deliver increased productivity and
   performance scaling for demanding, multithreaded workloads while still
   enabling thin-and-light laptop and 2 in 1 designs. (Credit: Intel
   Corporation)

   What’s New: Today, Intel introduced eight additional 10th Gen Intel®
   Core™ processors for modern laptop computing. The new mobile PC
   processors (formerly code-named “Comet Lake”) are tailor-made to
   deliver increased productivity and performance scaling for demanding,
   multithreaded workloads while still enabling thin-and-light laptop and
   2 in 1 designs with uncompromising battery life^1. These processors are
   performance powerhouses that bring double digit performance gains
   compared with the previous generation^2. The lineup also includes
   Intel’s first 6-core processor in the U-series, faster CPU frequencies,
   faster memory interfaces and the industry redefining connectivity with
   Intel® Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) and broader scaling of Thunderbolt™ 3. More than
   90 additional designs based on the 10th Gen Intel Core processor family
   will hit the shelves for the holiday season.

     “Our 10th Gen Intel Core mobile processors provide customers with
     the industry-leading range of products that deliver the best balance
     of performance, features, power and design for their specific needs.
     From multitasking to everyday content creation, the newest additions
     to the family scale performance for even higher levels of
     productivity — in addition to offering best-in-class platform
     connectivity via Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) and Thunderbolt 3 that people expect
     with 10th Gen.”
     –Chris Walker, Intel corporate vice president and general manager of
     Mobility Client Platforms in the Client Computing Group

   Why It Matters: Taking advantage of Intel’s world-class portfolio of
   technologies and intellectual property, the 10th Gen Intel Core
   processor family delivers a range of workload-optimized platforms to
   address diverse computing needs and experiences. The new 10th Gen Intel
   Core processors leverage the improvements in intra-node optimizations
   on Intel’s highly optimized 14nm process technology that enable up to
   16% overall performance gains^2 and over 41% better productivity and
   multitasking on Microsoft Office 365* compared with the previous
   generation^3 — all without compromising battery life^1. Additionally,
   they integrate the best wireless connectivity with Intel WiFi6
   (Gig+)^4 and support Thunderbolt 3, the fastest and most versatile port
   available^5.

   Earlier this month, Intel launched the first products in 10th Gen Intel
   Core processor family, which were developed on the 10nm process
   technology and focus on bringing high-performance artificial
   intelligence (AI) to the PC at scale, a big leap forward in graphics
   performance and best-in-class connectivity. The new processors
   introduced today share the same leading platform connectivity, while
   expanding the family with processors for scaling performance and
   frequencies for modern productivity workloads. The result is a complete
   family of processors that complement each other, giving people choices
   for what usages matter most to them and re-imagining the possibilities
   of a modern laptop experience.

   What They Feature:

   The new 10th Gen Intel Core processors range from Intel Core i3 to
   Intel Core i7 and feature:
     * Up to 6 cores and 12 threads
     * Up to 4.9 GHz max turbo frequency
     * Up to 12MB Intel Smart Cache
     * Configurable up to 25W for maximum performance (U-series)
     * Configurable down to 4.5W for 4-core fanless designs (Y-series)
     * Up to 1.15 GHz graphics frequency
     * LPDDR4x, LPDDR3, DDR4 memory speed increase to 2666 MT/s

   People can also expect the same great connectivity across the entire
   10th Gen Intel Core processor family. Integrated Intel Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+)
   brings enhanced WPA3 security for additional peace of mind and is
   nearly 3 times faster^6 to enable quick file downloads and more
   responsive performance throughout the home. Systems with these
   processors also support Thunderbolt 3 controllers enabling up to four
   Thunderbolt 3 ports, each capable of delivering power, download speeds
   of 40 Gb/s and connecting to the thousands of docks, displays and
   peripherals in the market, all via a single cable.

   Finally, the new processors scale the number of designs optimized
   with Intel® Adaptix™ Technology, supporting modern standby for faster
   wake and enabling multiple voice assistant services built into the PCs.
   Within Intel Adaptix Technology, Intel® Dynamic Tuning Technology
   enables OEM partners to tune 10th Gen Intel Core processor-based
   systems to achieve even more performance — ranging from 8% to 12% on a
   typical system^7. On select designs, Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology
   now offers the first ever AI-based pre-trained algorithms to predict
   workloads and allow higher turbo burst when responsiveness is needed
   and extended time in turbo for sustained workloads.

   How to Get Them: Laptops and 2 in 1s powered by the new 10th Gen Intel
   Core processors will be available from PC manufacturers for the holiday
   season. Select systems from PC manufacturers based on 10th Gen Intel
   Core processors are on track for verification through Intel’s
   innovation program code-named “Project Athena.” Look for the
   “Engineered for Mobile Performance” signage online and in retail stores
   this fall for the best of 10th Gen Intel Core processor-based systems
   from PC manufacturers.
