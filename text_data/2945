When Procter & Gamble Cut $200 Million in Digital Ad Spend, It Increased Its
Reach 10%

Unilever is also reevaluating its budget

   2018 is already shaping up to be a year when both Procter & Gamble and
   Unilever, two of the biggest CPG brands in the world, are demanding
   more out of their digital advertising by putting pressure on platforms
   and asking agencies to clean up their act.

   As part of P&G’s recent work to reevaluate its marketing spend and weed
   out spend that is ineffective, the CPG giant said it cut $200 million
   in spend in 2017. Last year, P&G revealed during an earnings call that
   it cut between $100 million to $140 million between April and July due
   to bots and brand safety concerns. The measures then continued for the
   rest of 2017, with the brand cutting roughly another $100 million
   between July and December.

   P&G’s $200 million digital cut were reinvested into areas with “media
   reach” including television, audio and ecommerce. During a speech at
   the Association of National Advertisers in Orlando, Fla. today, CMO
   Marc Pritchard declined to name specific companies where the ads were
   pulled from but said that it reduced spending “with several big
   players” by 20 percent to 50 percent. He added that the cuts helped P&G
   eliminate 20 percent of its ineffective marketing and increase reach by
   10 percent.

   Pritchard said that the brand’s year-old mandate asking for all
   partners to clean up shady and murky practices is working. More
   importantly, P&G has not pulled any media spend because of lingering
   concerns about the Media Rating Council’s third-party viewability
   metric, but they have pulled spend due to other issues like brand
   safety.

   “This new level of transparency is shining the light on what’s
   next—marketers taking back control of our own destiny to accelerate
   mass disruption—transforming our industry from the wasteful mass
   marketing we’ve been mired in for nearly a century to mass one-to-one
   brand building fueled by data and digital technology,” Pritchard said
   in a transcript of prepared remarks.

   Pritchard’s remarks come only two weeks after Unilever marketing chief
   Keith Weed made similar remarks at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s
   Annual Leadership Meeting in Palm Desert, Calif. Indeed it seems like
   CPG CMOs who control some of the world’s biggest budgets are the folks
   that the advertising industry has deemed important in putting pressure
   on platforms, ad-tech vendors and agencies.

   Pritchard has been particularly vocal about transparency issues in the
   digital media supply chain, including viewability, fraud, a lack of
   measurement and murky contracts. Collectively, those efforts are 90
   percent complete, Pritchard said.

   Those efforts include asking so-called walled gardens like Facebook,
   Google and Snap to receive third-party measurement accreditation from
   the MRC, which is underway by the tech platforms but not complete.

   In the meantime, Pritchard seems content with the platform’s content
   control tools. When a PR disaster around Tide Pods began brewing on
   digital platforms (where consumers eat the laundry detergent packets as
   if they were candy), Pritchard said he was impressed with YouTube,
   Facebook and Snapchat’s response.

   “Within a matter of hours, [YouTube CEO] Susan [Wojcicki]’s team swept
   the entire YouTube platform clean of these dangerous videos and changed
   the algorithm to ensure Tide’s safety video reached anyone searching
   for this unsafe behavior,” Pritchard said in the transcript. “Within
   minutes of contacting them, Carolyn Everson’s Facebook team, and Imran
   Khan’s Snap team did exactly the same. This not only reflected the
   right attitude, it demonstrated that the work over the past year gave
   them better control over their platforms.”

Why Brands Must Move From Communication With Consumers to Conversation

Or risk alienating the very customers they’re trying to woo

   As marketers, we’re increasingly finding ourselves facing an intriguing
   conundrum when it comes to creating personalized experiences for our
   customers. In our efforts to drive hyper-personalization, and appeal to
   every possible consumer need, we’re now at risk of confusing and, even
   worse, potentially alienating the very customers we’re trying to woo.

   With more data driving an explosive array of options, many consumers
   are overwhelmed by too many choices, causing them to be less satisfied,
   make poor decisions and abandon a website or brand. And this trend is
   on the rise—according to new research from the 2018 Accenture
   Interactive Personalization Pulse Report, 45 percent of customers have
   abandoned a site because it was too overwhelming, up from 40 percent
   last year.

   Rather than being liberated by choice, customers often find themselves
   burdened when interacting with brands. But there is a solution. By
   creating an ongoing, two-way digital dialogue, attributes and
   capabilities across all customer interactions can be used to create a
   living profile of the most unique aspects of each individual as they
   evolve in real time. This empowers marketers to understand why
   customers choose what they do versus simply what they’ve chosen in the
   past, enabling a better understanding of preferences, needs and
   passions.
   Customers aren’t looking for brands to define their journeys, they want
   brands to design experiences that help them create their own journeys.

   What’s even more exciting is that customers are willing to co-create
   their profiles with us. In fact, in our study, 75 percent of consumers
   say they’d find it valuable to create and manage a “style profile” that
   brands could use to better curate experiences and make recommendations.

   Customers recognize that, by contributing to the creation of their
   profiles, they are helping marketers get to the “why,” which ultimately
   adds value to them and enhances their brand experiences.

   These types of profiles go beyond basic choices such as product
   categories and communication channels. They capture true preferences.
   For example, if we were to look at fashion, aspects such as fabrics
   (satin), styles (peplum), features (cutouts), fit (classic) and brands
   (Adidas) would be explored to enable a living profile that evolves with
   the customer and through their interactions with the brand.

   The vast majority of consumers, 80 percent, say that no retailer or
   service provider has ever communicated with them in a way that felt too
   personalized or invasive. And of the 20 percent who have felt it was
   too personal or invasive, half reported that they felt uncomfortable
   because they didn’t knowingly provide the data the brand used.
   Transparency is key. Just as in personal relationships, trust can be
   lost when a brand goes outside the relationship to create an advantage.

   Companies succeed in these valuable relationships when they focus on
   making it easier for customers to buy and consume what they want, how
   and when they want. This is best accomplished through dialogue with
   customers versus the outdated approach of guessing (also known as
   predicting) what customers want. It’s similar to a sales rep engaging
   with customers versus hiding behind the counter trying to guess what
   they want by watching them shop.

   A great example of this is L’Oréal’s Makeup Genius app that allows
   customers to virtually test makeup. This creates a one-to-one,
   personalized customer experience that acts like a digital sales
   associate by identifying the user’s facial characteristics and ensuring
   a virtual makeup application experience unique to each individual. This
   also allows L’Oréal to be personally available whenever and wherever
   its customers are shopping for their products.

   This reflects one of the 2018 Fjord Trends findings where physical
   fights back by using digital to optimize and personalize
   brick-and-mortar in-store experiences. This will be especially true as
   companies combine AR capabilities with voice assistants to overlay
   physical stores with personalized guidance, product information and
   advice that turns a static consumer retail experience for the masses
   into a dynamically curated one for each individual.

   Customers aren’t looking for brands to define their journeys, but to
   design experiences that help them create their own journeys.

   This fundamental shift away from traditional communications modes to
   interactive conversations will enable marketers to drive new levels of
   personalization, trust and, ultimately, more fulfilling experiences.

The Office, Friends and Grey’s Anatomy Were Netflix’s Most Streamed Shows
Last Year

Library content represents the ‘overwhelming majority’ of viewership,
according to Nielsen

   By Jason Lynch

   May 7, 2019
   Last year, U.S. Netflix viewers streamed 52.1 billion minutes of The
   Office, more than any other show.

   Netflix spends more than $8 billion annually on original content, but
   most of the top 20 shows streamed on the service in the U.S. last year
   were library shows like The Office and Friends, according to new SVOD
   content ratings data from Nielsen.

   The measurement company shared the new data today during an upfront
   press briefing at which it also touched on addressable TV and viewers’
   ever-growing media consumption.

   Nielsen shared the top 20 in total minutes. (As always, Nielsen’s SVOD
   content ratings are U.S. only and include only connected devices, which
   represents 70-80% of overall Netflix viewing.) The Office topped the
   list at 52.1 billion minutes streamed. (Last month, former Office
   writer Mike Schur explained to Adweek why the series still resonates
   with viewers.)

   That was followed by Friends (32.6 billion minutes), Grey’s Anatomy
   (30.3 billion minutes), NCIS (21.2 billion minutes) and Criminal Minds
   (19.7 billion minutes). The first Netflix original title on the list
   was Orange Is the New Black, which was No. 7, with 18.8 billion minutes
   streamed.

   Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen’s svp of product leadership, said that once
   audiences start watching a show, they tend to stick with it, which
   would explain why more than half the shows in the top 20 had 100-plus
   episodes. Most Netflix originals, however, have considerably fewer than
   100 episodes.

   When looking at average ratings per episode instead of total minutes
   streamed, Netflix’s originals (especially Ozark) fare better than the
   library content because they have fewer episodes and are more highly
   promoted on the site, Fuhrer said. But “originals have a very brief
   lifespan,” he said. “They are viewed, and then people move on.”

   In other Netflix data, Nielsen found that “the older you get, the more
   you watch Netflix originals” as opposed to library content, Fuhrer
   said. Just 22% of 2- to 11-year-olds stream original content as part of
   their overall Netflix viewing, and that percentage increases to 33%
   among adults over 65. That’s in part because younger audiences watch
   content they think might be a Netflix original like Friends.

   “The overwhelming majority of content being viewed on Netflix is
   actually acquired content,” Fuhrer said.

   Looking at the premiere-day audiences for Netflix’s original series and
   movies, Nielsen found that while “more originals are being consumed,”
   there haven’t been many breakout shows on the level of Stranger Things’
   Season 2. That series, whose premiere-day reach (9 million viewers)
   doubled that of any other Netflix original over the past year and a
   half, was “an anomaly,” Fuhrer said.

   Of all original series and movies Nielsen measured, Hispanics
   represented the largest percentage of the audience for One Day at a
   Time’s third season in its first seven days, while the Beyoncé concert
   film Homecoming had the largest African-American audience percentage
   (55%).

   Overall, Netflix viewing is “very comparable to a broadcast network at
   this point,” Fuhrer said. Nielsen estimates Netflix accounted for 5.5%
   of all total TV viewing last year.

   While SVOD services overall are available in 69% of U.S. households,
   Netflix alone is available in 63% of households (up from 39% in 2015).
   Amazon has a 44% household penetration (up from 15% in 2015), and Hulu
   has jumped from 8% in 2015 to 23%.

   And while linear TV viewing continues to skew older, the age
   demographic breakdown of SVOD program viewing more accurately reflects
   that of the entire country.

Media consumption on the rise

   In non-Netflix data, Nielsen said consumers spent an average of 79
   hours a week last year connected to linear and digital media, up from
   61 hours in 2010 and 51 hours in 2002, a rise that is primarily due to
   the increase in smartphone usage.

  When Procter & Gamble Cut $200 Million in Digital Ad Spend, It Increased Its
                                   Reach 10%

   2018 is already shaping up to be a year when both Procter & Gamble and
   Unilever, two of the biggest CPG brands in the world, are demanding
   more out of their digital advertising by putting pressure on platforms
   and asking agencies to clean up their act.

   As part of P&G’s recent work to reevaluate its marketing spend and weed
   out spend that is ineffective, the CPG giant said it cut $200 million
   in spend in 2017. Last year, P&G revealed during an earnings call that
   it cut between $100 million to $140 million between April and July due
   to bots and brand safety concerns. The measures then continued for the
   rest of 2017, with the brand cutting roughly another $100 million
   between July and December.

   P&G’s $200 million digital cut were reinvested into areas with “media
   reach” including television, audio and ecommerce. During a speech at
   the Association of National Advertisers in Orlando, Fla. today, CMO
   Marc Pritchard declined to name specific companies where the ads were
   pulled from but said that it reduced spending “with several big
   players” by 20 percent to 50 percent. He added that the cuts helped P&G
   eliminate 20 percent of its ineffective marketing and increase reach by
   10 percent.

   Pritchard said that the brand’s year-old mandate asking for all
   partners to clean up shady and murky practices is working. More
   importantly, P&G has not pulled any media spend because of lingering
   concerns about the Media Rating Council’s third-party viewability
   metric, but they have pulled spend due to other issues like brand
   safety.

   “This new level of transparency is shining the light on what’s
   next—marketers taking back control of our own destiny to accelerate
   mass disruption—transforming our industry from the wasteful mass
   marketing we’ve been mired in for nearly a century to mass one-to-one
   brand building fueled by data and digital technology,” Pritchard said
   in a transcript of prepared remarks.

   Pritchard’s remarks come only two weeks after Unilever marketing chief
   Keith Weed made similar remarks at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s
   Annual Leadership Meeting in Palm Desert, Calif. Indeed it seems like
   CPG CMOs who control some of the world’s biggest budgets are the folks
   that the advertising industry has deemed important in putting pressure
   on platforms, ad-tech vendors and agencies.

   Pritchard has been particularly vocal about transparency issues in the
   digital media supply chain, including viewability, fraud, a lack of
   measurement and murky contracts. Collectively, those efforts are 90
   percent complete, Pritchard said.

   Those efforts include asking so-called walled gardens like Facebook,
   Google and Snap to receive third-party measurement accreditation from
   the MRC, which is underway by the tech platforms but not complete.

   In the meantime, Pritchard seems content with the platform’s content
   control tools. When a PR disaster around Tide Pods began brewing on
   digital platforms (where consumers eat the laundry detergent packets as
   if they were candy), Pritchard said he was impressed with YouTube,
   Facebook and Snapchat’s response.

   “Within a matter of hours, [YouTube CEO] Susan [Wojcicki]’s team swept
   the entire YouTube platform clean of these dangerous videos and changed
   the algorithm to ensure Tide’s safety video reached anyone searching
   for this unsafe behavior,” Pritchard said in the transcript. “Within
   minutes of contacting them, Carolyn Everson’s Facebook team, and Imran
   Khan’s Snap team did exactly the same. This not only reflected the
   right attitude, it demonstrated that the work over the past year gave
   them better control over their platforms.”

Why Brands Must Move From Communication With Consumers to Conversation

Or risk alienating the very customers they’re trying to woo

   As marketers, we’re increasingly finding ourselves facing an intriguing
   conundrum when it comes to creating personalized experiences for our
   customers. In our efforts to drive hyper-personalization, and appeal to
   every possible consumer need, we’re now at risk of confusing and, even
   worse, potentially alienating the very customers we’re trying to woo.

   With more data driving an explosive array of options, many consumers
   are overwhelmed by too many choices, causing them to be less satisfied,
   make poor decisions and abandon a website or brand. And this trend is
   on the rise—according to new research from the 2018 Accenture
   Interactive Personalization Pulse Report, 45 percent of customers have
   abandoned a site because it was too overwhelming, up from 40 percent
   last year.

   Rather than being liberated by choice, customers often find themselves
   burdened when interacting with brands. But there is a solution. By
   creating an ongoing, two-way digital dialogue, attributes and
   capabilities across all customer interactions can be used to create a
   living profile of the most unique aspects of each individual as they
   evolve in real time. This empowers marketers to understand why
   customers choose what they do versus simply what they’ve chosen in the
   past, enabling a better understanding of preferences, needs and
   passions.
   Customers aren’t looking for brands to define their journeys, they want
   brands to design experiences that help them create their own journeys.

   What’s even more exciting is that customers are willing to co-create
   their profiles with us. In fact, in our study, 75 percent of consumers
   say they’d find it valuable to create and manage a “style profile” that
   brands could use to better curate experiences and make recommendations.

   Customers recognize that, by contributing to the creation of their
   profiles, they are helping marketers get to the “why,” which ultimately
   adds value to them and enhances their brand experiences.

   These types of profiles go beyond basic choices such as product
   categories and communication channels. They capture true preferences.
   For example, if we were to look at fashion, aspects such as fabrics
   (satin), styles (peplum), features (cutouts), fit (classic) and brands
   (Adidas) would be explored to enable a living profile that evolves with
   the customer and through their interactions with the brand.

   The vast majority of consumers, 80 percent, say that no retailer or
   service provider has ever communicated with them in a way that felt too
   personalized or invasive. And of the 20 percent who have felt it was
   too personal or invasive, half reported that they felt uncomfortable
   because they didn’t knowingly provide the data the brand used.
   Transparency is key. Just as in personal relationships, trust can be
   lost when a brand goes outside the relationship to create an advantage.

   Companies succeed in these valuable relationships when they focus on
   making it easier for customers to buy and consume what they want, how
   and when they want. This is best accomplished through dialogue with
   customers versus the outdated approach of guessing (also known as
   predicting) what customers want. It’s similar to a sales rep engaging
   with customers versus hiding behind the counter trying to guess what
   they want by watching them shop.

   A great example of this is L’Oréal’s Makeup Genius app that allows
   customers to virtually test makeup. This creates a one-to-one,
   personalized customer experience that acts like a digital sales
   associate by identifying the user’s facial characteristics and ensuring
   a virtual makeup application experience unique to each individual. This
   also allows L’Oréal to be personally available whenever and wherever
   its customers are shopping for their products.

   This reflects one of the 2018 Fjord Trends findings where physical
   fights back by using digital to optimize and personalize
   brick-and-mortar in-store experiences. This will be especially true as
   companies combine AR capabilities with voice assistants to overlay
   physical stores with personalized guidance, product information and
   advice that turns a static consumer retail experience for the masses
   into a dynamically curated one for each individual.

   Customers aren’t looking for brands to define their journeys, but to
   design experiences that help them create their own journeys.

   This fundamental shift away from traditional communications modes to
   interactive conversations will enable marketers to drive new levels of
   personalization, trust and, ultimately, more fulfilling experiences.

The Office, Friends and Grey’s Anatomy Were Netflix’s Most Streamed Shows
Last Year

Library content represents the ‘overwhelming majority’ of viewership,
according to Nielsen

   By Jason Lynch

   May 7, 2019
   Last year, U.S. Netflix viewers streamed 52.1 billion minutes of The
   Office, more than any other show.

   Netflix spends more than $8 billion annually on original content, but
   most of the top 20 shows streamed on the service in the U.S. last year
   were library shows like The Office and Friends, according to new SVOD
   content ratings data from Nielsen.

   The measurement company shared the new data today during an upfront
   press briefing at which it also touched on addressable TV and viewers’
   ever-growing media consumption.

   Nielsen shared the top 20 in total minutes. (As always, Nielsen’s SVOD
   content ratings are U.S. only and include only connected devices, which
   represents 70-80% of overall Netflix viewing.) The Office topped the
   list at 52.1 billion minutes streamed. (Last month, former Office
   writer Mike Schur explained to Adweek why the series still resonates
   with viewers.)

   That was followed by Friends (32.6 billion minutes), Grey’s Anatomy
   (30.3 billion minutes), NCIS (21.2 billion minutes) and Criminal Minds
   (19.7 billion minutes). The first Netflix original title on the list
   was Orange Is the New Black, which was No. 7, with 18.8 billion minutes
   streamed.

   Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen’s svp of product leadership, said that once
   audiences start watching a show, they tend to stick with it, which
   would explain why more than half the shows in the top 20 had 100-plus
   episodes. Most Netflix originals, however, have considerably fewer than
   100 episodes.

   When looking at average ratings per episode instead of total minutes
   streamed, Netflix’s originals (especially Ozark) fare better than the
   library content because they have fewer episodes and are more highly
   promoted on the site, Fuhrer said. But “originals have a very brief
   lifespan,” he said. “They are viewed, and then people move on.”

   In other Netflix data, Nielsen found that “the older you get, the more
   you watch Netflix originals” as opposed to library content, Fuhrer
   said. Just 22% of 2- to 11-year-olds stream original content as part of
   their overall Netflix viewing, and that percentage increases to 33%
   among adults over 65. That’s in part because younger audiences watch
   content they think might be a Netflix original like Friends.

   “The overwhelming majority of content being viewed on Netflix is
   actually acquired content,” Fuhrer said.

   Looking at the premiere-day audiences for Netflix’s original series and
   movies, Nielsen found that while “more originals are being consumed,”
   there haven’t been many breakout shows on the level of Stranger Things’
   Season 2. That series, whose premiere-day reach (9 million viewers)
   doubled that of any other Netflix original over the past year and a
   half, was “an anomaly,” Fuhrer said.

   Of all original series and movies Nielsen measured, Hispanics
   represented the largest percentage of the audience for One Day at a
   Time’s third season in its first seven days, while the Beyoncé concert
   film Homecoming had the largest African-American audience percentage
   (55%).

   Overall, Netflix viewing is “very comparable to a broadcast network at
   this point,” Fuhrer said. Nielsen estimates Netflix accounted for 5.5%
   of all total TV viewing last year.

   While SVOD services overall are available in 69% of U.S. households,
   Netflix alone is available in 63% of households (up from 39% in 2015).
   Amazon has a 44% household penetration (up from 15% in 2015), and Hulu
   has jumped from 8% in 2015 to 23%.

   And while linear TV viewing continues to skew older, the age
   demographic breakdown of SVOD program viewing more accurately reflects
   that of the entire country.

Media consumption on the rise

   In non-Netflix data, Nielsen said consumers spent an average of 79
   hours a week last year connected to linear and digital media, up from
   61 hours in 2010 and 51 hours in 2002, a rise that is primarily due to
   the increase in smartphone usage.

  When Procter & Gamble Cut $200 Million in Digital Ad Spend, It Increased Its
                                   Reach 10%

Unilever is also reevaluating its budget

   2018 is already shaping up to be a year when both Procter & Gamble and
   Unilever, two of the biggest CPG brands in the world, are demanding
   more out of their digital advertising by putting pressure on platforms
   and asking agencies to clean up their act.

   As part of P&G’s recent work to reevaluate its marketing spend and weed
   out spend that is ineffective, the CPG giant said it cut $200 million
   in spend in 2017. Last year, P&G revealed during an earnings call that
   it cut between $100 million to $140 million between April and July due
   to bots and brand safety concerns. The measures then continued for the
   rest of 2017, with the brand cutting roughly another $100 million
   between July and December.

   P&G’s $200 million digital cut were reinvested into areas with “media
   reach” including television, audio and ecommerce. During a speech at
   the Association of National Advertisers in Orlando, Fla. today, CMO
   Marc Pritchard declined to name specific companies where the ads were
   pulled from but said that it reduced spending “with several big
   players” by 20 percent to 50 percent. He added that the cuts helped P&G
   eliminate 20 percent of its ineffective marketing and increase reach by
   10 percent.

   Pritchard said that the brand’s year-old mandate asking for all
   partners to clean up shady and murky practices is working. More
   importantly, P&G has not pulled any media spend because of lingering
   concerns about the Media Rating Council’s third-party viewability
   metric, but they have pulled spend due to other issues like brand
   safety.

   “This new level of transparency is shining the light on what’s
   next—marketers taking back control of our own destiny to accelerate
   mass disruption—transforming our industry from the wasteful mass
   marketing we’ve been mired in for nearly a century to mass one-to-one
   brand building fueled by data and digital technology,” Pritchard said
   in a transcript of prepared remarks.

   Pritchard’s remarks come only two weeks after Unilever marketing chief
   Keith Weed made similar remarks at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s
   Annual Leadership Meeting in Palm Desert, Calif. Indeed it seems like
   CPG CMOs who control some of the world’s biggest budgets are the folks
   that the advertising industry has deemed important in putting pressure
   on platforms, ad-tech vendors and agencies.

   Pritchard has been particularly vocal about transparency issues in the
   digital media supply chain, including viewability, fraud, a lack of
   measurement and murky contracts. Collectively, those efforts are 90
   percent complete, Pritchard said.

   Those efforts include asking so-called walled gardens like Facebook,
   Google and Snap to receive third-party measurement accreditation from
   the MRC, which is underway by the tech platforms but not complete.

   In the meantime, Pritchard seems content with the platform’s content
   control tools. When a PR disaster around Tide Pods began brewing on
   digital platforms (where consumers eat the laundry detergent packets as
   if they were candy), Pritchard said he was impressed with YouTube,
   Facebook and Snapchat’s response.

   “Within a matter of hours, [YouTube CEO] Susan [Wojcicki]’s team swept
   the entire YouTube platform clean of these dangerous videos and changed
   the algorithm to ensure Tide’s safety video reached anyone searching
   for this unsafe behavior,” Pritchard said in the transcript. “Within
   minutes of contacting them, Carolyn Everson’s Facebook team, and Imran
   Khan’s Snap team did exactly the same. This not only reflected the
   right attitude, it demonstrated that the work over the past year gave
   them better control over their platforms.”

     Why Brands Must Move From Communication With Consumers to Conversation

Or risk alienating the very customers they’re trying to woo

   Some customers feel burdened when interacting with brands.

   As marketers, we’re increasingly finding ourselves facing an intriguing
   conundrum when it comes to creating personalized experiences for our
   customers. In our efforts to drive hyper-personalization, and appeal to
   every possible consumer need, we’re now at risk of confusing and, even
   worse, potentially alienating the very customers we’re trying to woo.

   With more data driving an explosive array of options, many consumers
   are overwhelmed by too many choices, causing them to be less satisfied,
   make poor decisions and abandon a website or brand. And this trend is
   on the rise—according to new research from the 2018 Accenture
   Interactive Personalization Pulse Report, 45 percent of customers have
   abandoned a site because it was too overwhelming, up from 40 percent
   last year.

   Rather than being liberated by choice, customers often find themselves
   burdened when interacting with brands. But there is a solution. By
   creating an ongoing, two-way digital dialogue, attributes and
   capabilities across all customer interactions can be used to create a
   living profile of the most unique aspects of each individual as they
   evolve in real time. This empowers marketers to understand why
   customers choose what they do versus simply what they’ve chosen in the
   past, enabling a better understanding of preferences, needs and
   passions.
   Customers aren’t looking for brands to define their journeys, they want
   brands to design experiences that help them create their own journeys.

   What’s even more exciting is that customers are willing to co-create
   their profiles with us. In fact, in our study, 75 percent of consumers
   say they’d find it valuable to create and manage a “style profile” that
   brands could use to better curate experiences and make recommendations.

   Customers recognize that, by contributing to the creation of their
   profiles, they are helping marketers get to the “why,” which ultimately
   adds value to them and enhances their brand experiences.

   These types of profiles go beyond basic choices such as product
   categories and communication channels. They capture true preferences.
   For example, if we were to look at fashion, aspects such as fabrics
   (satin), styles (peplum), features (cutouts), fit (classic) and brands
   (Adidas) would be explored to enable a living profile that evolves with
   the customer and through their interactions with the brand.

   The vast majority of consumers, 80 percent, say that no retailer or
   service provider has ever communicated with them in a way that felt too
   personalized or invasive. And of the 20 percent who have felt it was
   too personal or invasive, half reported that they felt uncomfortable
   because they didn’t knowingly provide the data the brand used.
   Transparency is key. Just as in personal relationships, trust can be
   lost when a brand goes outside the relationship to create an advantage.

   Companies succeed in these valuable relationships when they focus on
   making it easier for customers to buy and consume what they want, how
   and when they want. This is best accomplished through dialogue with
   customers versus the outdated approach of guessing (also known as
   predicting) what customers want. It’s similar to a sales rep engaging
   with customers versus hiding behind the counter trying to guess what
   they want by watching them shop.

   A great example of this is L’Oréal’s Makeup Genius app that allows
   customers to virtually test makeup. This creates a one-to-one,
   personalized customer experience that acts like a digital sales
   associate by identifying the user’s facial characteristics and ensuring
   a virtual makeup application experience unique to each individual. This
   also allows L’Oréal to be personally available whenever and wherever
   its customers are shopping for their products.

   This reflects one of the 2018 Fjord Trends findings where physical
   fights back by using digital to optimize and personalize
   brick-and-mortar in-store experiences. This will be especially true as
   companies combine AR capabilities with voice assistants to overlay
   physical stores with personalized guidance, product information and
   advice that turns a static consumer retail experience for the masses
   into a dynamically curated one for each individual.

   Customers aren’t looking for brands to define their journeys, but to
   design experiences that help them create their own journeys.

   This fundamental shift away from traditional communications modes to
   interactive conversations will enable marketers to drive new levels of
   personalization, trust and, ultimately, more fulfilling experiences.

The Office, Friends and Grey’s Anatomy Were Netflix’s Most Streamed Shows Last
                                      Year

Library content represents the ‘overwhelming majority’ of viewership, according
to Nielsen

   By Jason Lynch
   |
   May 7, 2019

   Last year, U.S. Netflix viewers streamed 52.1 billion minutes of The
   Office, more than any other show.

   Netflix spends more than $8 billion annually on original content, but
   most of the top 20 shows streamed on the service in the U.S. last year
   were library shows like The Office and Friends, according to new SVOD
   content ratings data from Nielsen.

   The measurement company shared the new data today during an upfront
   press briefing at which it also touched on addressable TV and viewers’
   ever-growing media consumption.

   Nielsen shared the top 20 in total minutes. (As always, Nielsen’s SVOD
   content ratings are U.S. only and include only connected devices, which
   represents 70-80% of overall Netflix viewing.) The Office topped the
   list at 52.1 billion minutes streamed. (Last month, former Office
   writer Mike Schur explained to Adweek why the series still resonates
   with viewers.)

   That was followed by Friends (32.6 billion minutes), Grey’s Anatomy
   (30.3 billion minutes), NCIS (21.2 billion minutes) and Criminal Minds
   (19.7 billion minutes). The first Netflix original title on the list
   was Orange Is the New Black, which was No. 7, with 18.8 billion minutes
   streamed.

   Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen’s svp of product leadership, said that once
   audiences start watching a show, they tend to stick with it, which
   would explain why more than half the shows in the top 20 had 100-plus
   episodes. Most Netflix originals, however, have considerably fewer than
   100 episodes.

   When looking at average ratings per episode instead of total minutes
   streamed, Netflix’s originals (especially Ozark) fare better than the
   library content because they have fewer episodes and are more highly
   promoted on the site, Fuhrer said. But “originals have a very brief
   lifespan,” he said. “They are viewed, and then people move on.”

   In other Netflix data, Nielsen found that “the older you get, the more
   you watch Netflix originals” as opposed to library content, Fuhrer
   said. Just 22% of 2- to 11-year-olds stream original content as part of
   their overall Netflix viewing, and that percentage increases to 33%
   among adults over 65. That’s in part because younger audiences watch
   content they think might be a Netflix original like Friends.

   “The overwhelming majority of content being viewed on Netflix is
   actually acquired content,” Fuhrer said.

   Looking at the premiere-day audiences for Netflix’s original series and
   movies, Nielsen found that while “more originals are being consumed,”
   there haven’t been many breakout shows on the level of Stranger Things’
   Season 2. That series, whose premiere-day reach (9 million viewers)
   doubled that of any other Netflix original over the past year and a
   half, was “an anomaly,” Fuhrer said.

   Of all original series and movies Nielsen measured, Hispanics
   represented the largest percentage of the audience for One Day at a
   Time’s third season in its first seven days, while the Beyoncé concert
   film Homecoming had the largest African-American audience percentage
   (55%).

   Overall, Netflix viewing is “very comparable to a broadcast network at
   this point,” Fuhrer said. Nielsen estimates Netflix accounted for 5.5%
   of all total TV viewing last year.

   While SVOD services overall are available in 69% of U.S. households,
   Netflix alone is available in 63% of households (up from 39% in 2015).
   Amazon has a 44% household penetration (up from 15% in 2015), and Hulu
   has jumped from 8% in 2015 to 23%.

   And while linear TV viewing continues to skew older, the age
   demographic breakdown of SVOD program viewing more accurately reflects
   that of the entire country.

Media consumption on the rise

   In non-Netflix data, Nielsen said consumers spent an average of 79
   hours a week last year connected to linear and digital media, up from
   61 hours in 2010 and 51 hours in 2002, a rise that is primarily due to
   the increase in smartphone usage.

   Sixty-nine percent of U.S households have access to at least one SVOD
   device and subscribe to “a little bit more than two” channels on
   average, said Peter Katsingris, svp audience insights.

   When households receive new connected devices, there is “an immediate
   behavior change,” Katsingris said. One month later, they are using them
   an average of one hour and five minutes per day, growing to a daily
   average of one hour and 20 minutes a year after purchase.

   Daily TV usage for those new connected TV owners, meanwhile, drops a
   month later from seven hours, 38 minutes to seven hours, 19 minutes. A
   year after purchase, daily TV usage is down to six hours, 33 minutes a
   day.

   Ad-supported connected TV viewing grew 182% year over year, according
   to  Marissa McArdle, vp, product leadership, digital.

   And while TV delivers eight times more impressions than digital for ad
   campaigns targeting the 18-49 demo, digital can be effective as part of
   a cross-platform campaign targeting that same demo, providing an
   average reach increase of 16%.

   Young viewers are more likely to connect with digital ads in a
   cross-platform campaign. That campaign will reach 12% of adults 18-34
   through digital only (just 5% of the 35-49 demo is digital only, while
   the digital-only percentage for adults over 50 is just 2%). When
   factoring in connected TV devices, 28% of 18- to 24-year-old viewers
   reached on connected TV only saw the ad on that device, not on TV,
   computer or mobile.

Addressable update

   Kelly Abcarian, general manager, advanced video advertising, talked
   about Nielsen’s addressable efforts through its advanced audience
   suite. Forty-six percent of all homes now have smart TVs, and there has
   been a five- to sevenfold year-over-year increase in broadcast and
   cable TV viewing over internet connected devices, while broadcast and
   cable TV viewing using smart TVs has doubled in that time

   Nielsen projects advanced advertising will account for $4.7 billion in
   TV ad spend in 2020.

   The company rolled out addressable TV pilots last fall with CBS, A+E
   Networks and LG.

   Broadcasters said they are impressed thus far with CPMs and onboarding
   but want to see an improved sell rate percentage. Agencies said there
   were accurate forecasts for campaign planning but “want to see more
   standardized audience segmentation data,” Abcarian said, a common
   criticism around addressable TV.

   Another addressable complaint: There are still too many manual
   processes to deliver addressable campaigns with “a lot of siloed
   buckets of inventory” and “different measurement sticks,” Abcarian
   said.
