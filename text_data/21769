   SOLRAD 1

   SOLRAD 2 was a surveillance and scientific satellite developed by the
   U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. Like the similar SOLRAD 1 satellite
   (model pictured), it was intended to measure solar X-rays and
   ultraviolet radiation while conducting a covert surveillance mission,
   mapping the Soviet Union's air defense radar network with its onboard
   Galactic Radiation and Background electronic surveillance package.
   SOLRAD 1, launched in June 1960, had been the first satellite to
   observe solar X-rays, confirming the connection between increased solar
   X-ray activity and radio fade-outs, and the first to conduct
   surveillance from orbit, revealing a Soviet network that was more
   extensive than had been expected. SOLRAD 2 was launched along with the
   Transit 3A satellite atop a Thor DM-21 Ablestar rocket on November 30,
   1960, but both satellites failed to reach orbit when the booster flew
   off course and was destroyed. Debris rained down over Cuba, prompting
   protests from the Cuban government. (Full article...)

   NameEdit

   Andorra la Vella means "Andorra the Town", to distinguish it from the
   Principality of Andorra as a whole.^[3] Although in Catalan the word
   vella (like French vieille) is derived from the Latin word vetula which
   means "old", the Vella here (like French ville and Catalan vila) is
   derived from the Latin word villa and means "town".^[4]

   HistoryEdit

   Sant Andreu Church

   The site of Andorra la Vella has been settled since prior to the
   Christian era—notably by the Andosin tribe from the late Neolithic. The
   state is one of the Marca Hispanica created and protected by
   Charlemagne in the eighth century as a buffer from the Moorish settlers
   in the Iberian Peninsula.^[5]

   The settlement of Andorra la Vella has been the principal city of
   Andorra since 1278 when the French and the Episcopal co-princes agreed
   to joint suzerainty. Andorra la Vella's old town—the Barri
   Antic—includes streets and buildings dating from this time. Its most
   notable building is the Casa de la Vall—constructed in the early
   sixteenth century—which has been the state's parliamentary house since
   1702. Andorra la Vella was, during this period, the capital of a
   largely isolated and feudal state, which retained its independence due
   to this principle of co-sovereignty.

   Well into the twentieth century, the area around Andorra la Vella
   remained largely forgotten; indeed the state was not part of the Treaty
   of Versailles, simply because it was not noticed. After political
   turmoil in the 1930s and an attempted coup by Boris Skossyreff, an
   informal democracy developed.

   In 1993, the country's first constitution formalised this parliamentary
   democracy with executive, legislative, and judicial branches located in
   Andorra la Vella.

   During this period, Andorra also developed as a tax haven, resulting in
   the construction of modern banking offices in Andorra La Vella. The
   city also developed its skiing facilities, to the extent that Andorra
   la Vella was Andorra's applicant city for the XXI Olympic Winter Games,
   the 2010 Winter Olympics. However, Andorra la Vella was not selected by
   the IOC as a candidate city, following the evaluation report of an IOC
   commission. It also hosted both the 1991 and 2005 Games of the Small
   States of Europe.

   1994,Andorra joins the Council of Europe.^[6]

   GeographyEdit

   Andorra la Vella is located in the south west of Andorra, at 42°30′N
   1°30′E﻿ / ﻿42.500°N 1.500°E﻿ / 42.500; 1.500,^[7] at the confluence of
   two mountain streams, the Valira del Nord (Northern Valira) and the
   Valira de l'Orient (Eastern Valira), which join to form the Gran
   Valira. It adjoins the urban area of Escaldes-Engordany. The city is at
   1,023 metres (3,356 ft) above sea level.

   Andorra la Vella has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate
   classification: Cfb), with warm summers and chilly to cold, snowy
   winters. The average annual precipitation is 812.3 mm (32 in).

   The central Església de Sant Esteve (Saint Stephen) church is part of
   the area that guidebooks often label as a picturesque part of the
   city.^[10] This was built in a Romanesque style in the eleventh

   GeographyEdit

   Rhône-Alpes is located in the southeast of France. The neighboring
   (pre-2016) regions are Bourgogne (Burgundy) and Franche-Comté to the
   north, Auvergne to the west, Languedoc-Roussillon to the southwest, and
   Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur to the south. The eastern part of the region
   is in the Alps, and borders Switzerland and Italy. The highest peak is
   Mont Blanc, on the French-Italian border. The central part of the
   region comprises the river valleys of the Rhône and the Saône. The
   confluence of these two rivers is at Lyon. The western part of the
   region contains the start of the Massif Central mountain range. The
   region also borders or contains major lakes such as Lake Geneva (Lac
   Léman) and Lake Annecy. The Ardèche flows through the southwest portion
   of the region, where it has carved the deepest gorge in Europe.

   As with the rest of France, French is the only official language of the
   region. Until the mid-20th century, Arpitan was widely spoken in the
   whole region, while many of the inhabitants of the south spoke
   varieties of Occitan; both are in steep decline in this region. There
   are immigrant populations from Armenia, Italy, North Africa, Poland and
   Portugal, and elsewhere.

   Rhône-Alpes is made up of the following departments:
     * Ain (01). Capital: Bourg-en-Bresse
     * Ardèche (07). Capital: Privas
     * Drôme (26). Capital: Valence
     * Isère (38). Capital: Grenoble
     * Loire (42). Capital: Saint-Étienne
     * Rhône (69). Capital: Lyon
     * Savoie (73). Capital: Chambéry
     * Haute-Savoie (74). Capital: Annecy

   And, since 2015, Metropolis with territorial collectivity statute:
     * Metropolis of Lyon (69). Capital: Lyon

   PopulationEdit

   Rhône-Alpes contains 3 major cities in France. It forms the triangle
   Lyon - Grenoble - Saint-Étienne. This triangle is the economic core of
   the region. These three urban areas are very complementary, and have
   smaller cities around, like satellites.
     * Lyon area : 2,188,759 inhabitants (2011)
     * Grenoble area : 675,122 inhabitants (2011)
     * Saint-Étienne area : 508,548 inhabitants (2011)
     * Valence area : 175,095 inhabitants (2011)

   HistoryEdit

   Although there have been people in Rhône-Alpes since pre-historic
   times, the earliest recorded settlers of the region were the Gauls
   (Celts). Cities such as Lyon were founded by them and the region traded
   with both northern and southern Europe. Most of the area became part of
   Roman territory during the invasion of Celtic Gaul led by Julius Caesar
   and was at various times part of the regions of Lugdunensis and Gallia.
   Lyon itself became a major city in the Roman Empire.

   The region, excepting Savoy, was part of the Merovingian and
   Carolingian Kingdoms before becoming a royal territory under the
   Capetians. As it became a royal territory early on in French history,
   its cultural, political and economic influences and developments
   paralleled those of greater France. (See History of France.)

   TransportationEdit
   Main article: Transport in Rhône-Alpes

   Rhône-Alpes is a major European transit hub, linking northern France
   and Europe to the Mediterranean area. Millions travel along its
   motorways in summertime from Paris to holidays at the sea. The E15
   Euroroute (Britain to Spain) runs through the region. There are
   international airports at Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and many
   other minor airports and airfields. The region is also a transport hub
   for the rail network with the TGV running through Lyon from Paris and
   the north, to the Mediterranean. A high-speed rail link is planned from
   Lyon to Turin.

   EconomyEdit
   Main article: Economy of Rhône-Alpes

   Rhône-Alpes is a prosperous region which can be seen by its per capita
   GDP of about €31,231 ($40,000), which is higher than the French
   average, and an average income of €35,910 ($50,246), its economy second
   in size only to Île-de-France in France. This can be attributed to the
   diversity of the production in different sectors. The region is one of
   the Four Motors for Europe.
     * Industry, in particular:
          + Light engineering and high-tech
          + Mechanical engineering in the area of Annecy
          + Precision machining in the area of Cluses
     * Services, in particular:
          + High-tech industries, nanotechnology, biotechnology especially
            in Grenoble with 62,300 jobs^[3] in these sectors thanks to
            the presence of the Polygone Scientifique, Inovallée and some
            large companies as Schneider Electric.
          + Optic and design in Saint-Étienne
          + Tourism with the Alps (for skiing), Lyon and Grenoble (for
            culture) and the Ardèche (adventure sports/camping)
            particularly popular
          + Education, with major universities in Lyon, Grenoble and
            Saint-Étienne.

   In the past mining, especially coal mining was an important sector,
   particularly around Saint-Étienne, although this has declined since the
   1970s.

   The area of the region that lies close to Switzerland has an economy
   linked to that of Geneva. This area forms a hinterland for the Geneva
   hub.^[4]

   The Triangle of Lyon, Saint-Étienne and Grenoble contribute a GDP of
   €145 billion to the region. Add Valence to it, it is almost €150
   billion. In addition, Lyon alone has a Gross Metropolitan Product of
   about €85 billion.

   Lyon is noted as a gastronomic centre of France and specialities served
   in its traditional bouchons include Lyon sausage, sophisticated salami
   (known there as "rosette"), tripe and quenelles. In the east of the
   region the food has an Alpine flavour with dishes such as fondue,
   raclette common, gratin dauphinois and gratin savoyard. The region is
   also famous for its Bresse poultry and the many varieties of cheese
   including Tomme de Savoie, Bleu de Bresse, Reblochon, Saint-Marcellin
   and Vacherin.

   Wines in this region include the very famous Beaujolais, Côtes du Rhône
   and Savoy wine. Chartreuse liqueur is made in the region.

   Winter OlympicsEdit

   Rhône-Alpes region has hosted the Winter Olympics three times; in 1924
   at Chamonix, 1968 at Grenoble, and 1992 at Albertville. Annecy tried to
   be 4th city, but it failed, getting outvoted by Pyeong-Chang.

   TourismEdit

   The Bastille, 264 m above Grenoble

   Situated between Paris and the Côte d’Azur, on the border with both
   Switzerland and Italy, and offering access to two international
   airports (Lyon and Geneva), impressive rail connections and a vast
   motorway network, the Rhône-Alpes region is at "the crossroads of
   Europe".

   Boasting eight natural parks and peerless sites such as Mont Blanc and
   the Gorges de l’Ardèche, Rhône-Alpes offers a wide range of different
   landscapes: mountains, vineyards and gentle valleys, fields of lavender
   and olive groves.

   Every form of sport is readily available, set against an impressive
   natural backdrop: skiing, hiking, mountain biking or even paragliding
   and canoeing. Besides hosting three Winter Olympics games due to its
   being the largest ski area in the world^[citation needed], Rhône-Alpes
   is the second most important golfing region in France with over 60
   courses.

   Saint-Gervais-les-Bains has been a popular holiday destination since
   the early 1900s

   Enthusiasts of art and culture will not be disappointed by the region's
   Villes d’Art: Lyon, which is classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage
   site, Annecy, Grenoble, Chambéry, and Saint-Étienne.

   And last but not least, connoisseurs of good food and wine will be
   spoilt for choice by the range of local specialties available to taste
   along with a Beaujolais or a Côtes du Rhône, and by the sheer number of
   famous restaurants (with Paul Bocuse at the top of the list) in the
   region.

LakesEdit

   There are six main lakes in Rhône-Alpes
     * Lac de Paladru
     * Lac d'Aiguebelette
     * Lac du Bourget
     * Lac d'Annecy
     * Lac de Nantua
     * Lac Léman

GastronomyEdit

   For several centuries Lyon, capital of Rhône-Alpes, has been known as
   the French capital of gastronomy, due, in part, to the presence of many
   of France's finest chefs in the city and its surroundings (e.g. Paul
   Bocuse). This reputation also comes from the fact that two of France's
   best known wine-growing regions are located near Lyon: the Beaujolais
   to the North, and the Côtes du Rhône to the South. Beaujolais wine is
   very popular in Lyon and remains the most common table wine served with
   local dishes.

   Lyon is the home of very typical and traditional restaurants: the
   bouchons. Bouchons are usually convivial restaurants serving local
   dishes, and local wines.

   Lyon is famous for its morning snacks, the mâchons, made up of local
   charcuterie, especially the rosette and usually accompanied by
   Beaujolais red wine. Traditional local dishes include saucisson de Lyon
   (sausage), andouillette, coq au vin, esox (pike) quenelle, gras double
   (tripe cooked with onions), salade lyonnaise (lettuce with bacon,
   croûtons and a poached egg), marrons glacés and cardoon au gratin.
