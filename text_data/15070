   Web applications like Gmail, Facebook, Campfire and Pandora are
   becoming more and more like desktop applications every day. Running
   each of these web apps in a separate tab in your browser can be a real
   pain.

   Fluid lets you create a Real Mac App (or "Fluid App") out of any
   website or web application, effectively turning your favorite web apps
   into OS X desktop apps.

   Creating a Fluid App out of your favorite website is simple. Enter the
   website's URL, provide a name, and optionally choose an icon. Click
   "Create", and within seconds your chosen website has a permanent home
   on your Mac as a real Mac application that appears in your Dock.

   Fluid is free. You can download Fluid for free and create as many Fluid
   Apps as you like.

   However, for $5, you can purchase a Fluid License which unlocks a few
   extra features:
    1. Pin Fluid Apps to the Mac OS X Status Bar. (Fluid App Menu → Pin to
       Status Bar…)
    2. Use Userscripts or Userstyles in your Fluid Apps. (Window →
       Userscripts)
    3. Use Full Screen mode in your Fluid Apps. (View → Enter Full Screen)
