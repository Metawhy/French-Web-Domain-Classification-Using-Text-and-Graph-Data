   Aww, I love this one! "gentle being" The words are from a vintage
   dictionary.
   These bunnies aren't only for Easter. They would look great with any
   decor and make the cutest vignettes!
   As always, thank you for looking and make sure to check out my
   shop here.

Vintage Style Bunnies

   I love these little bunnies. They are fun to make and they are so cute
   to decorate with. I love creating vignettes and what better way to make
    your vignettes pop than to add a little piece of original art to the
                                    mix!

                                     013

   These little ones were made special for someone. She wanted a cream and
   brown one and they look so sweet together. Of course it’s great to see
   pictures, but it’s not the same as seeing them in person. (They’re
                                   cuter!)

                                     014

  For those that don’t know, I make these original one of a kind folk art
                       pieces from paperclay by hand.

                     To view more of my art, click here!

         They’re great for Valentines, Easter, Spring or anytime!

                           Thanks for stopping by!

   My latest creations are these sweet little paperclay bunnies. They are
    based off of Vintage Stuffed Bunnies from the 40’s – 50’s. 002

      This one measures 5” tall and 2 1/2” wide. She sells for $39.

                                     004

        Her little sister is 4” tall and 1 1/2” wide. She is $29.

                                     003

                  They are daintier and so sweet in person.

                                     001
