About

   The Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) recognizes the need to
   improve the ways in which the outputs of scholarly research are
   evaluated. The declaration was developed in 2012 during the Annual
   Meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology in San Francisco. It
   has become a worldwide initiative covering all scholarly disciplines
   and all key stakeholders including funders, publishers, professional
   societies, institutions, and researchers. We encourage all individuals
   and organizations who are interested in developing and promoting best
   practice in the assessment of scholarly research to sign DORA.

   DORA’s governance procedures are openly available, and our current
   priorities are outlined in the 2018 Roadmap.

Make it possible, make it rewarded, make it normal

   There is widespread recognition that the research culture in academia
   requires reform. Hypercompetitive vying for grant funding, prestigious
   publications, and job opportunities foster a toxic environment.
   Furthermore, it distracts from the core value of the scientific
   community, which is a principled search for increasingly accurate
   explanations of how the world works.

Include Untenured Faculty in Departmental Tenure Decisions

   Having committed to the hiring and development of early career
   scientists, it is in the best interest of departments and institutions
   to make the tenure process as transparent and consistent as possible to
   ensure success. One mechanism to accomplish this is to allow untenured
   faculty to discuss and vote on the tenure files of more senior faculty
   members.

Opportunities for review, promotion, and tenure reform

   Faculty often cite concerns about promotion and tenure evaluations as
   important factors limiting their adoption of open access, open data,
   and other open scholarship practices. We began the review, promotion,
   and tenure (RPT) project in 2016 in an effort to better understand how
   faculty are being evaluated and where there might be opportunities for
   reform. We collected over 800 documents governing RPT processes from a
   representative sample of 129 universities in the U.S. and Canada.

Leveraging values to improve and align research assessment policies and
practices

   Universities cannot achieve their missions and visions if their stated
   values are out of line with research assessment policies and practices.
   Although most university mission statements specify research, teaching,
   and public service as their central commitments, contributions to
   research are often valued at the expense of teaching and public
   service. How serious is this misalignment and what can be done about
   it?

Societies’ Role in Improving Research Assessment

   Scientific societies have a vested interest in research assessment as
   standard bearers for their profession. We represent members who are at
   all career stages and in many different career paths. Societies have
   multiple roles in the assessment infrastructure. They publish
   scientific journals; they host large and small meetings; they provide
   professional development training; they give recognition through awards
   and fellowships; and they set standards for the profession.
   Collectively, this gives societies a variety of leverage points to
   affect change.

Those who can, do; those who can’t, teach

   The conundrum is easy to understand:  Conventional teaching assessments
   rely heavily on student feedback, which, whether through metrics or
   narrative comments, is often fraught with bias.  It is even more
   difficult to assess teaching when done in “engaged” settings, not in
   the classroom (e.g., for medical schools, in association with patient
   care).

The importance of research assessment to accelerate the development of global
health innovations for emerging and neglected infectious diseases

   Research assessment can be extremely useful as a tool to evaluate the
   quality and the impact of the activities needed to achieve the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs, adopted in 2015 by the
   General Assembly of the United Nations, envision that by the year 2030
   the world could be transformed.

How conceptual clarity can improve how we assess research

   Current discourse on research assessment places high emphasis on
   “impact.” However, there are many different concepts of impact, and
   many different concepts of how research achieves impact. The resulting
   ambiguity and confusion confound efforts to improve research
   assessment. To reliably assess research, we need clarity about what it
   is we want to assess.

Research assessment as a human-centered design problem

   Human-centered design is well-positioned to supplement the ongoing
   activity of sharing best practices and specific, successful examples of
   new research assessment strategies, contributing a deep understanding
   what matters to individuals and entities, and a perspective on
   realigning incentives, social norms, and points of leverage where we
   might redefine and reward what’s valued in the future.

Pairing research assessment reforms to faculty search procedures

   Much of the emphasis of DORA’s initiatives has revolved around
   appropriate metrics and assessments.  Equally important is designing
   mechanisms that employ those assessments at decision-making steps.
