   Multi-instrumentiste compositeur, Henri Caraguel est depuis 15 ans un
   animateur précieux de la scène bordelaise.
   Infatigable mineur du folklore américain, à l'instar d'un John Fahey ou
   d'un Bert Jansch, il diversifie sans cesse sa technique instrumentale,

   Il sort aujourd'hui un album consacré à cet instrument légendaire
   d'origine Hawaïenne. ... more
