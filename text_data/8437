Styling Letters with a Pinch of Magic

   Hi there, I’m Risa. I’m a designer, illustrator, and letterer who
   channels my whimsical side into delightful illustrations. I bring my
   designs to life through digital magic and striking color palettes.

   Upon discovering my love for art at age 14, I found myself bouncing
   from one creative field to the next—trying out Photography, Video
   Production, and Web Design, until I finally landed on Illustration and
   Lettering. It took me a couple more years to find my own art style that
   has now attracted clients from around the globe. I describe my style as
   a vibrant mixture of striking colors with a touch of whimsy and modern
   retro.

   Most of my work are typographic in nature and my passion for the field
   has allowed me to work on projects like book covers, magazine spreads,
   advertising campaigns, promotional posters, and merchandising items. On
   my days off, I like to visit new cities, read books, and go full nerd
   by binge-watching television shows.

   For commissions and inquiries, you can either contact
   me at hello@risarodil.com or through my agents Doreen, Kate, or Tom  at
   draw@goodillustration.com
