   Quantum computing is still in its infancy, even though the idea of a
   quantum computer was developed some thirty years ago. But there are a
   whole load of pioneering organizations (like Google) that are exploring
   how this potentially revolutionary technology could help them solve
   complex problems that modern-day computers just aren’t capable of doing
   at any useful speed.

   One such organization is NASA, whose use of D-Wave Systems quantum
   computing machines is helping it research better and safer methods of
   space travel, air traffic controls and missions involving sending
   robots to far-off places, explained Davide Venturelli, a science
   operations manager at NASA Ames Research Center, Universities Space
   Research Association. I’ll be speaking with Venturelli on stage at
   Structure Data 2015 from March 18-19 in New York City and we’ll be sure
   to cover how NASA envisions the future of quantum computing.

   The basic idea of quantum computing is that quantum bits, or qubits —
   which can exist in more than two states and be represented as both a 0
   and 1 simultaneously — can be used to greatly boost computing power
   compared to even today’s most powerful super computers. This contrasts
   with the modern-day binary computing model, in which the many
   transistors contained in silicon chips can be either switched on or off
   and can thus only exist in two states, expressed as a 0 or 1.

   With the development of D-Wave Systems machines that have quantum
   computing capabilities (although researchers argue they are not true
   quantum computers along the lines of the ones dreamed up on pen and
   paper in the early 1980s), scientists and engineers can now attempt to
   solve much more complex tasks without having to perform the type of
   experiments used to generate quantum phenomena, explained Venturelli.
   However, these machines are just the tip of the quantum iceberg, and
   Venturelli still pays attention to ground-breaking research that may
   lead to better quantum devices.

   NASA hopes to use the machines to solve optimization problems, which in
   its most basic terms means finding the best solution out of many
   solutions. One such example of an optimization problem NASA has
   focussed on deals with air-traffic management in which scientists try
   to “optimize the routes” of planes in order to “make sure the landing
   and taking off of airplanes in terminals are as efficient as possible,”
   said Venturelli. If the scientists are able to route air traffic in the
   best possible way, there’s a good chance they can reduce the dangers of
   congested skies.
   Davide Venturelli Davide Venturelli

   NASA also wants to use quantum computing to help with automated
   planning and scheduling, a subset of artificial intelligence that NASA
   uses to plan out robotic missions to other planets. NASA typically
   plans out these type of endeavors ten years in advance, said
   Venturelli.

   The goal is to plan out the mission of the robots far in advance
   because realtime communication with the robots just isn’t feasible
   given how far away other planets are from the Earth. Using quantum
   optimization, NASA scientists will have new tools to basically forecast
   what may occur during the mission and what would be the best possible
   plan of attack for the robots to do their work.

   “We have some missions where we imagine sending multiple robots to
   planets and these robots will need to coordinate and will need to do
   operations like landing and such without realtime communication,” said
   Venturelli.

   Scientists need to “maximize the lifetime of the batteries” used by the
   robots as they perform tasks on the planets that may include drilling
   or using infrared thermometers to record temperatures, so careful
   planning of how the robots do their tasks is needed in order to ensure
   that no time is wasted. This all involves a lot of variables that
   normal computers just aren’t up-to-speed to process and could be a fit
   for quantum computing.

   “[The robot] has to figure out what is the best schedule and figure out
   if he can recharge and when to go in a region where it is dark and a
   region where there is water,” said Venturelli. “We need to preplan the
   mission.”

       Your post was extremely educational and interesting. I think it’s
       so amazing how NASA is booming right now and new missions,
       launches, and inventions are expanding. By having the quatum
       computing for NASA, numerous problems will be able to be resolved.
       It’s great to see how the quantum computing works and to know we
       have a hopeful future.

No Henry, you need to get real about Yahoo. Here are the facts

   For past year or so, there has been a bit of a lovefest around Yahoo (s
   YHOO), the rapidly aging former web star that has lost the attention
   and preeminence it enjoyed in the 1990s and early 2000s. The showers of
   praise, prompted in part by the appointment of Marissa Mayer as its
   chief executive officer and her ability to understand the modern web,
   have resulted in oodles of press for the company.

   A year later, that buzz has helped the stock run up almost over 90
   percent — something that has warmed the cockles of the cold, mean and
   brutal Wall Street crowd. It led the “activist” investor Dan Loeb to
   actively bail out of Yahoo stock and lock in hefty profits.

   Marissa Mayer Ken Goldman Yahoo earnings call video

   It has been a year that has kept the Yahoo press office very busy. And
   it has been a year full of non-critical looks at a company that has
   made news for giving iPhones to its employees, rapping remote workers
   on their knuckles and minor upgrades to once iconic products. Or as a
   cynic (like me) would say — it is like spraying Chanel No. 5 in a
   pigsty.

   My recent appearance on Bloomberg TV in which I focused on the reality
   of Yahoo has led some — including Business Insider’s Henry Blodget, who
   benefits directly from the largess of Yahoo as a longtime shareholder
   and part time employee  — to ask me to lighten up.

   The problem is that this is precisely the time when one needs to ask
   the tough questions of the company. Yahoo’s new CEO is a wonderful,
   intelligent and hard-working executive whose attention to detail and
   product feedback is a much welcome break for the beleaguered company’s
   workforce. Her Google-like management moves such as free food and
   quarterly reviews to weed out low performers are good steps. But these
   moves, inspiring as they might be, have not resulted in any real
   products and results.

   And this is not about Marissa, who remains someone I admire deeply. It
   is about the company, its culture and its place on the modern web. It
   is about Yahoo loyalists and their inability to look beyond the
   esoteric and frankly worthless metric; the 700 million people who use
   Yahoo each month. That is a blivet full of 15 year old excrement.

11,700 employees, 1 year, 4 Relaunches

   Yahoo apologists point to the face lifts given to Flickr, Yahoo Mail,
   Yahoo News and Yahoo Weather as achievements for a company that employs
   about 11,700 people. Of course, none of those people point to that fact
   that the number of people (in the U.S.) who use Yahoo Messenger has
   tumbled from over 12.5 million to just over 6 million (based on
   comScore data). Or that (U.S.) visitors to Yahoo Finance are stagnant
   at shade over 34 million — the same number they were in July 2012.
   Flickr had 25 million (U.S.) users in July 2012 according to comScore,
   a number that had declined to 21.5 million in July 2013.

   Dismiss all that as nitpicking, but you can’t ignore the fact that
   according to research firm EMarketer “Yahoo’s share of global digital
   ad spending is set to decline from 3.37 percent to 3.1 percent this
   year.”

   When I put that forecast against the somewhat ambiguous number of Yahoo
   topping the comScore rankings of most widely used websites I see that
   nothing really has changed. Yahoo’s Weather app uses data from a third
   party and it doesn’t matter how well it does — it can’t create enough
   views and thus create a meaningful revenue stream.

   I am not the only non-believer. “We continue to believe that a
   turnaround of Yahoo’s consolidated operations is a long shot, even if
   Marissa Mayer has improved morale and sharpened Yahoo’s focus on
   product aesthetic, functionality and mobile apps,” wrote Jordan Rohan,
   who follows the company for brokerage, Stifel & Co., in a recent
   research note to his clients. Jordan is being generous.

   Like I told Bloomberg’s Emily Chang, Yahoo’s product lineup sort of
   blows. There isn’t a single product they make that I want to use.

   Yahoo, like most large web companies from the 1990s, gained mass scale
   because it arrived to the party first and moved fast enough to keep
   signing up more and more people. Of course, it helped that there wasn’t
   much competition, especially after the big bubble burst in 2001. Yahoo
   met the needs of a lot of newcomers to the internet by offering simple
   and easy-to-use products. Fast forward to today and we have a whole new
   generation of internet users who have grown up using a plethora of
   services. They understand what is good, what is average and what is
   simply terrible. Yahoo’s offerings for this new class of users aren’t
   that compelling enough to shift their attention to the company.

   yahoo-reflected-in-eye-o

   It is often easy to look at the web services from the perspective of
   the current/past generation of users and get blinded by the big
   numbers, but technology companies have to look forward and make sure
   they capture new classes of users. It is the challenge faced by every
   single consumer products company — brands and products age with their
   early adopters and eventually become worthless. As a knowledgeable man
   recently told me, “Yahoo is like the Fat Elvis” when all of us “want a
   new king of rock-n-roll.” Buying Tumblr is a good move, but again, it’s
   too soon to declare victory.

Mobile first? Actually no, mobile last

   Looking forward, it is pretty clear the world isn’t about the web as we
   know it and instead it is all about the mobile. The good news is that
   Yahoo’s CEO knows that.

   “I hope that at some point we are looking at a world where mobile is a
   majority of our revenue,” Mayer told BusinessWeek writer Brad Stone.
   The bad news is that Yahoo has done nothing to capitalize on that
   opportunity. It has launched some new apps but boy, are they struggling
   in the rankings.

   Take for example the top free 50 iOS apps in the US iTunes App store —
   there is one Yahoo property in there, Tumblr, which cost the company a
   whopping $1 billion. Flickr, whose much ballyhooed rebirth inspired
   headlines across the globe, ranks a mere 39th in the “photos and
   videos” apps. BusinessWeek celebrated Yahoo’s focus on new products and
   design, but someone should look at Yahoo Mail — the font it uses is
   from the 1990s. (Yahoo Mail is ranked at 114 spot on the US iOS App
   Store.) On the US Google Play store, Yahoo Mail is ranked at #19,
   Tumblr at #81 and Yahoo Fantasy Sports League at #109.

   Here is a tiny bit from Bloomberg’s piece about Yahoo.

     Cahan’s division, called Mobile and Emerging Products, now exceeds
     330 people and has its primary offices in New York, San Francisco,
     and Sunnyvale, Calif. Underscoring mobile’s importance, Mayer
     ordered the team’s work space in Sunnyvale renovated. Unlike the
     soporific purple and beige cubiclevilles that fill the rest of
     Yahoo’s dot-com-era headquarters, the mobile group has adjustable
     workstations that let employees sit or stand. There’s an exposed
     ceiling, whiteboards on every other wall, and big colorful posters
     that display giant iPhone screens.

   330 people — you gotta be kidding me! There is one question that needs
   to be asked: what the hell are these people on Yahoo’s mobile team
   doing? What is the daily active user base for Yahoo, and its individual
   products. “We also launched our redesigned Yahoo! app for iOS and
   Android, complete with Summly integration. As a result of this launch,
   we saw 55% increase in daily active users and a 60% increase in time
   spent using the application.” Mayer said during the conference call,
   but how about some actual numbers?

   And while Yahoo management talks about mobile from one side of its
   mouth, they are unable to resist the lurid lucre of web-based
   advertising. Perhaps that is why they are out celebrating the comScore
   top spot and looking at signing up Katie Couric to their web platform,
   just as she signed up Saturday Night Live (SNL) to the Yahoo
   platform.  As I see it, for about the 13th year, Yahoo continues to be
   schizophrenic, torn between its desire to be either a media entity or a
   technology company.

Rotten to the core

   I can sit and talk about in this abstract terms, but the fact is that
   Yahoo’s core is getting completely hollowed out. According to one Wall
   Street analyst, search-based advertising accounts for about 75 percent
   of company’s operating profits, and yet no one seems to notice that
   Yahoo’s share of US search queries has declined from 20.3 percent in
   2009 to 11.3 percent at the end of July 2013. In fact, every month is a
   new low.

   Bing and Ballmer By selling its [DEL: search :DEL] crown jewels —
   search — to Microsoft, the company is more reliant on Microsoft for
   profits than most realize. And all that search-market share loss didn’t
   go to Google, but it has been sucked up by Microsoft’s Bing which now
   accounts for about 18 percent of the total US search queries, according
   to comScore.

   Things are worse on mobile — the company doesn’t even have a double
   digit share of the mobile search market. Mobile (unlike Yahoo on the
   web) search is driven almost entirely by ability to search inside the
   URL/search bar and most people end up using Google as a default option.
   Google owns Android and has done a good job of becoming an important
   part of iOS users’ habits as well. Google’s search is slowly and surely
   moving towards offering intelligent serendipity that can drive a new
   revenue stream from action-oriented advertising, the kind which makes
   sense on mobile platforms.

   Yahoo Weather for iOS In comparison, Yahoo is still dependent on the
   old school page-view driven advertising business model. And even here,
   Yahoo is facing a nightmare situation — thanks to technology in the
   form of programmatic buying. This type of buying is limiting the demand
   of premium advertising that Yahoo has been hawking.

   Yahoo no longer enjoys the monopoly on the massive scale web
   advertising. That mantle has been taken over by Facebook, which, quite
   frankly, has figured out a way to create inventory of billions of page
   views at costs much lower than Yahoo. As a result it offers advertisers
   cheap display advertising but with ability to more effectively pick and
   choose attractive demographics. In other words, with better targeting
   and cheaper prices, why would a display advertiser look at Yahoo over
   Facebook?

   Let’s just face it — there isn’t anything premium about Yahoo
   anymore. By the way, this isn’t just my theory — Yahoo blamed
   programmatic buying for the revenue shortfall in its most recent
   quarter (Q2 2013.) And this is a problem that isn’t going away,
   especially since Facebook, which throws up tens of billions of page
   views daily, has made making money its sole mission.

So why is Yahoo stock up?

   “All of the stock bump is because of increase in the valuation of
   Alibaba,” Ben Schachter, analyst with Macquarie Securities pointed out.
   The positive press and improved image of the company because of Marissa
   has helped the stock. But as far as products are concerned, “we haven’t
   seen much.” He isn’t the only one who is in wait-and-see mode. Other
   analysts too say that there remain substantial challenges.

   While it is easy to say that these things take time, one thing is
   clear: Yahoo doesn’t have time. It doesn’t have time to move at the
   speed of General Motors in the age of Tesla. It has to learn that when
   it comes to the only thing that matters in the world of consumer
   technology — attention — they are losing it to sexier, shinier and
   prettier things.

   And forget the products — so far Yahoo has been unable to attract top
   quality talent to the company. Not one 20-something I have talked to in
   the past six months has wistfully talked about working for Yahoo. And
   even those who have joined Yahoo from Google are joining the company
   thanks to mega-million dollar contracts, not because they want to work
   there. When Yahoo becomes the desired job-spot for a fresh, new tech
   tinkerer — that will be the time I will lighten up on Yahoo.

   And in the interim, I am going to focus all my writing on companies
   actually inventing the future. And if anyone from Yahoo management
   wants to come talk to me, I am all ears and they know where to find me
   — as long as they come with data that shows not only is its audience
   and daily engagement growing, but also its revenues, profits and appeal
   to a new generation of users.

       I was interviewed for Yahoo mobile division (I’m a former
       employee). I brought them a new product idea that was perfect for
       them, scalable to Billions, and a new source of advertising that
       jumped wayyy past Facebook. New, new, new, but just about ready to
       pop.
       They didn’t even listen. Just asking BS little technical quiz
       questions (this was after I specifically asked them not to waste my
       time with quiz questions).
       Whether I got the job or not, didn’t matter. What mattered was
       their utter lack of curiosity about a new mobile segment. They are
       busy playing catch-up with 3 years ago.

       Thanks, Om, for another brilliant article that goes beyond the
       mainstream media’s fascination with Vogue-worthy Marissa Mayer. I
       appreciate your faith in her abilities, but Yahoo! has very little
       to show after her first year at the helm. “Improving employee
       morale” with free meals and iPhones has not resulted in any
       meaningful products for today’s digital audience.
       In my view as a stockholder and six-year, bleed-purple veteran of
       Yahoo! Media (now happily elsewhere), Mayer has squandered the
       jewel of Yahoo’s once-excellent content and fallen into its old
       “technology company” trap. She has abdicated her responsibility for
       Yahoo’s content to self-entitled, unqualified lower managers — with
       the results already apparent on Yahoo’s dumbed-down Front Page and
       celebrity-obsessed Entertainment properties. I worry about the
       future of News, Finance and Sports.
       Meanwhile, by adopting the timeworn conundrum that “Yahoo! is a
       technology company,” Mayer fell into the trap that made Yahoo such
       a technological also-ran. Yahoo has never learned that technology
       has to be in service to the end user, not an end in itself.
       Consumers don’t go to Web sites for technology; they visit for the
       content and “stuff” that the technology delivers. Ross Levinsohn
       knew that — and Mayer should know it from Google. But all we get
       are a cool Weather app and redesigns of obsolete properties.

       I have a feeling (but I am not an expert on big-ass companies) that
       Yahoo lacks vision.As an example – they had a huge opportunity with
       Flickr, they just gave it a facelift and a bigger room, but it’s
       doesn’t have any more value over what was there 5 – 7 years ago.
       Other web sites stepped in and took over some of it, but some of
       the value is still on the table – yet Yahoo can’t even grab that.

       I have followed your posts and opinions on Yahoo, and also on the
       same page when it comes to Mayer being an awesome leader.
       How much time do you think is right for a turnaround of a company
       which is “Yahoo with all the over hang you have mentioned” lead by
       some one like Mayer? How about a post on how Yahoo should do what
       with each product or business for a turn around?

       You are only as good as your last innovation. Yahoo basically has
       none of it’s own, and hasn’t done much with the ones it bought, and
       overpaid for.
       I have very fond memories of Yahoo, but now my interest is almost
       entirely in watching if MM can do something spectacular to save the
       company. In other words, my interest is in her, not really Yahoo,
       at least until they release something that creates or moves a new
       market.

       There’s also a fairly transparent, tell-don’t-show nature to the
       way they are trying to project a sense of “renewal”. Average
       consumers don’t care and amateur observers can see through it
       (i.e., a rise in stock price and an influx of talent being
       supported by Alibaba’s valuation).
       There’s no PR effort more transparent than their off-the-mark “30
       Days of Change” campaign:

       Thanks for this informative piece. I’m sure she is talented but she
       essentially condemned the internet when she killed work-from-home.
       She (and her head of HR) said that communication, speed, quality,
       collaboration, organizing, trust, teamwork, and monitoring all
       suffer and that misunderstandings and costs increase when employees
       work from home.
       Then, cutting even deeper, Meyer said, â€œIt is difficult for
       humans to trust people that they don’t frequently see face to
       face.â€
       Your CEO is damning the internet?!
       Where is the article that says Yahoo is cutting new ground to make
       working from home even more effective?

       Maybe, just maybe, Yahoo!’s stock has also been helped by the
       rather large increase in efficiency. Yahoo hasn’t really gained
       anything in terms of revenue, but profit is up at a good margin.
       That’s business 101. Before you worry too much about growing
       revenue, make sure you capitalize on the revenues you have. If you
       can do that, it opens the door to higher quality products. It’s a
       process. Why acquire all this small companies? Because many of them
       are efficient, and those gains in efficiency directly translate to
       real dollars.
       This isn’t the only reason, but it’s definitely on the mind of many
       after the last earnings call.
       Another big reason that you touch on is the movement. At this point
       in the game it doesn’t matter where the movement is happening, the
       fact that a company like Yahoo! is making these changes is a rather
       big deal. If you pay closer attention you will realize the primary
       objective of all these moves: being nimble. Marissa Mayer is
       dead-set on making Yahoo! one of the most agile large web
       properties out. Putting them in position to capitalize not on
       current opportunities, but ones that one turn up for 5 or 10 years.
       Sprucing up what you have no isn’t a bad idea, but if you really
       want to grow and you’re Yahoo, you need to set yourself up for what
       is coming not what’s already here.
       That’s what they’re doing. And that’s why their stock will keep
       going up over the next 6 quarters. As long as they remain on this
       path I see good things for them. They will be competitive again.
       And this is coming from someone who doesn’t use Yahoo! (Google).
       Game recognize game as some would say.

       “It is about Yahoo loyalists and their inability to look beyond the
       esoteric and frankly worthless metric; the 700 million people who
       use Yahoo each month. That is a blivet full of 15 year old
       excrement.”
       Directly from the GigaOm About Us page….
       “Since 2006, GigaOM has grown into the leading independent voice on

       “By selling its search crown jewels â€” search â€” to Microsoft,
       the company is more reliant on Microsoft for profits than most
       realize.”
       Or maybe the author thought the word ‘search’ belonged twice in
       that sentence.
       And on the article content? Based on what I know about Yahoo (not
       much), the arguments and data backing them are compelling.

       Can you elaborate on the impact Alibaba’s assets have on Yahoo’s US
       stock price / overall traffic numbers? Two additional follow-up
       questions:
       1. What is a reasonable time horizon to measure the success of
       Yahoo’s M&A activities over the past 2 quarters?
       2. Do you see Yahoo giving up the US market and focusing on China?
       Basically, the Yahoo identity decreasing and Alibaba identity
       increasing.

            joined via M&A leave. If they leave sooner, then they are in
            trouble
            On US vs China, they are going to be non-player in China from

                 Thanks Om. I did read the Loeb article. I guess I didn’t
                 frame my question correctly.
                 I wanted to ask if you have direct visibility or opinions
                 on specific Alibaba products that will have an impact on
                 Yahoo’s worldwide traffic numbers. Right now, most
                 literature I’ve come across presents Alibaba as a black
                 box and projects a future based as a function of Yahoo’s
                 % ownership of Alibaba, not from actual user, traffic or
                 revenue numbers. Asset sales contributed the majority of
                 Yahoo’s cash flow in the previous year, so I’m wondering
                 how they plan to keep momentum going with a shrunken
                 asset base and with assets outside the US.
                 Interesting thought on the M&A, don’t most companies have
                 a mandatory lock-in period for acquired staff? I’d assume
                 folks would be loathe to break these golden handcuffs and
                 walk away.

       This article was extremely frustrating to read:

       US Google Play store, Yahoo Mail is ranked at #19, Tumblr at #81
       and Yahoo Fantasy Sports League at #109.”
       ARE YOU SERIOUS? These numbers are freakishly misleading because it
       reports them in overall app rankings, but instead we should be
       looking at them by each category in which they are published. For
       example:
       Yahoo! Mail (Productivity category): #5
       Yahoo! Weather (Weather category): #2
       Yahoo! Sports (Sports category): #13
       Yahoo! Fantasy Football (Sports category): #2

       One of the “core” products they are applauded for is Yahoo Fantasy
       Football. If Yahoo were investing in its core successes, its
       fantasy app would not have auto-drafted Aaron Hernandez as my TE in
       the 6th round last night, more than a month after he was locked up
       on murder charges and released from his team. There are dozens of
       other players not on any roster for months who still appear in the
       Yahoo Fantasy league. This is not that hard for a company with
       Yahoo’s resources who wants to show that they care about investing
       in their “successful” products.

       Great piece, Om.
       I’m always so confused by the contrast between Marissa Mayer’s
       philosophy/aesthetic — clean, helpful, classy, non-evil — and the
       Yahoo! frontpage — Kardassians permanently in the top stories, junk
       stories almost indistinguishable from fake sponsored stories. . . .
       It seems like they are too afraid of losing traffic to tinker with
       improving quality, leaving them, like you say, stuck with their
       existing, dwindling market segment.
       While it should still be a platform with a lot of upside,
       especially with the right M&A, I agree that the potential is still
       more unproven than shown.

SumUp adds American Express to its mobile point-of-sale terminal roster

   And so the European mobile point-of-sale (POS) terminal wars continue.
   With iZettle, Payleven, Adyen, mPowa and SumUp all trying to replicate
   Square’s dongle-based model in the EU, the various stages in this
   scramble for the mobile merchant tend to involve the signing of
   distribution partnerships or the support of new cards or card
   technologies.

   Yesterday it was iZettle adding chip-and-pin capabilities — as happened
   earlier this month with Payleven — and partnering up with Banco
   Santander, and today it’s SumUp’s newfound support for American
   Express(s axp) cards.

   SumUp is still working on the technical implementation for the deal,
   and its merchants will start being able to take payments from AmEx
   cardholders in the second quarter of the year in the UK, Germany,
   Ireland, Austria, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Belgium and
   Portugal should follow, though SumUp is still in negotiations with
   American Express on that point.

   This is not the first such firm to sign with AmEx – after all, American
   Express has actively invested in iZettle. However, according to SumUp,
   the deal means the company “will accept more types of cards in more
   regions than any other mobile point-of-sale technology provider
   worldwide”. Co-founder Stefan Jeschonnek told me SumUp has “several
   tens of thousands of merchants” now using its terminals, and “several
   thousand” are joining each week.

   SumUp does have an extra trick up its sleeve, too: later this year it
   will be bringing out the slightly Square Wallet-ish SumUp Pay, which
   will let end-users pre-approve a participating merchant through an app,
   then pop up on that merchant’s system as soon as they walk into their
   shop – the idea there is to allow purchases based on a simple verbal
   interaction with the merchant, without the need for even taking the
   phone out.

   And according to Jeschonnek, SumUp will be able to exploit its growing
   installed base of merchants to crack the classic chicken-and-egg
   problem associated with mobile wallet schemes:

     “We’re making payments smoother today with the card reader, but
     we’re thinking about how things should work in the future. We are
     building technology to make that real-world interaction possible
     again… The difference this time around is that we already have a
     pretty large and fast-growing merchant base. For our merchants to
     accept SumUp Pay will be as simple as updating their app.”

   He added that SumUp Pay would also provide a nifty way around Visa’s
   stringent authentication procedures, which have previously proved a
   stumbling block for the likes of iZettle, when it launches later this
   year.

   It’s good to see companies innovating in the financial technology
   space, and SumUp’s focus on in-house technological development
   theoretically places it well there. That said, with the mobile POS wars
   as heated as they are in Europe right now, I would not be in the least
   bit surprised to see a rival try to beat SumUp to its frictionless
   payment goal.

       For me when it comes to MPOS, i think mPowa (www.mpowa.com) will
       reach more consumers this 2013. The company already started with
       global credit card compatibility, unlike other MPOS providers, they
       only get permissions just now.

NASA at Structure Data 2015

How NASA uses quantum computing for space travel and robotics

   Quantum computing is still in its infancy, even though the idea of a
   quantum computer was developed some thirty years ago. But there are a
   whole load of pioneering organizations (like Google) that are exploring
   how this potentially revolutionary technology could help them solve
   complex problems that modern-day computers just aren’t capable of doing
   at any useful speed.

   One such organization is NASA, whose use of D-Wave Systems quantum
   computing machines is helping it research better and safer methods of
   space travel, air traffic controls and missions involving sending
   robots to far-off places, explained Davide Venturelli, a science
   operations manager at NASA Ames Research Center, Universities Space
   Research Association. I’ll be speaking with Venturelli on stage at
   Structure Data 2015 from March 18-19 in New York City and we’ll be sure
   to cover how NASA envisions the future of quantum computing.

   The basic idea of quantum computing is that quantum bits, or qubits —
   which can exist in more than two states and be represented as both a 0
   and 1 simultaneously — can be used to greatly boost computing power
   compared to even today’s most powerful super computers. This contrasts
   with the modern-day binary computing model, in which the many
   transistors contained in silicon chips can be either switched on or off
   and can thus only exist in two states, expressed as a 0 or 1.

   With the development of D-Wave Systems machines that have quantum
   computing capabilities (although researchers argue they are not true
   quantum computers along the lines of the ones dreamed up on pen and
   paper in the early 1980s), scientists and engineers can now attempt to
   solve much more complex tasks without having to perform the type of
   experiments used to generate quantum phenomena, explained Venturelli.
   However, these machines are just the tip of the quantum iceberg, and
   Venturelli still pays attention to ground-breaking research that may
   lead to better quantum devices.

   NASA hopes to use the machines to solve optimization problems, which in
   its most basic terms means finding the best solution out of many
   solutions. One such example of an optimization problem NASA has
   focussed on deals with air-traffic management in which scientists try
   to “optimize the routes” of planes in order to “make sure the landing
   and taking off of airplanes in terminals are as efficient as possible,”
   said Venturelli. If the scientists are able to route air traffic in the
   best possible way, there’s a good chance they can reduce the dangers of
   congested skies.

   NASA also wants to use quantum computing to help with automated
   planning and scheduling, a subset of artificial intelligence that NASA
   uses to plan out robotic missions to other planets. NASA typically
   plans out these type of endeavors ten years in advance, said
   Venturelli.

   The goal is to plan out the mission of the robots far in advance
   because realtime communication with the robots just isn’t feasible
   given how far away other planets are from the Earth. Using quantum
   optimization, NASA scientists will have new tools to basically forecast
   what may occur during the mission and what would be the best possible
   plan of attack for the robots to do their work.

   “We have some missions where we imagine sending multiple robots to
   planets and these robots will need to coordinate and will need to do
   operations like landing and such without realtime communication,” said
   Venturelli.

   Scientists need to “maximize the lifetime of the batteries” used by the
   robots as they perform tasks on the planets that may include drilling
   or using infrared thermometers to record temperatures, so careful
   planning of how the robots do their tasks is needed in order to ensure
   that no time is wasted. This all involves a lot of variables that
   normal computers just aren’t up-to-speed to process and could be a fit
   for quantum computing.

   “[The robot] has to figure out what is the best schedule and figure out
   if he can recharge and when to go in a region where it is dark and a
   region where there is water,” said Venturelli. “We need to preplan the
   mission.”

       Your post was extremely educational and interesting. I think it’s
       so amazing how NASA is booming right now and new missions,
       launches, and inventions are expanding. By having the quatum
       computing for NASA, numerous problems will be able to be resolved.
       It’s great to see how the quantum computing works and to know we
       have a hopeful future.

No Henry, you need to get real about Yahoo. Here are the facts

   For past year or so, there has been a bit of a lovefest around Yahoo (s
   YHOO), the rapidly aging former web star that has lost the attention
   and preeminence it enjoyed in the 1990s and early 2000s. The showers of
   praise, prompted in part by the appointment of Marissa Mayer as its
   chief executive officer and her ability to understand the modern web,
   have resulted in oodles of press for the company.

   A year later, that buzz has helped the stock run up almost over 90
   percent — something that has warmed the cockles of the cold, mean and
   brutal Wall Street crowd. It led the “activist” investor Dan Loeb to
   actively bail out of Yahoo stock and lock in hefty profits.

   Marissa Mayer Ken Goldman Yahoo earnings call video

   It has been a year that has kept the Yahoo press office very busy. And
   it has been a year full of non-critical looks at a company that has
   made news for giving iPhones to its employees, rapping remote workers
   on their knuckles and minor upgrades to once iconic products. Or as a
   cynic (like me) would say — it is like spraying Chanel No. 5 in a
   pigsty.

   My recent appearance on Bloomberg TV in which I focused on the reality
   of Yahoo has led some — including Business Insider’s Henry Blodget, who
   benefits directly from the largess of Yahoo as a longtime shareholder
   and part time employee  — to ask me to lighten up.

   The problem is that this is precisely the time when one needs to ask
   the tough questions of the company. Yahoo’s new CEO is a wonderful,
   intelligent and hard-working executive whose attention to detail and
   product feedback is a much welcome break for the beleaguered company’s
   workforce. Her Google-like management moves such as free food and
   quarterly reviews to weed out low performers are good steps. But these
   moves, inspiring as they might be, have not resulted in any real
   products and results.

   And this is not about Marissa, who remains someone I admire deeply. It
   is about the company, its culture and its place on the modern web. It
   is about Yahoo loyalists and their inability to look beyond the
   esoteric and frankly worthless metric; the 700 million people who use
   Yahoo each month. That is a blivet full of 15 year old excrement.

11,700 employees, 1 year, 4 Relaunches

   Yahoo apologists point to the face lifts given to Flickr, Yahoo Mail,
   Yahoo News and Yahoo Weather as achievements for a company that employs
   about 11,700 people. Of course, none of those people point to that fact
   that the number of people (in the U.S.) who use Yahoo Messenger has
   tumbled from over 12.5 million to just over 6 million (based on
   comScore data). Or that (U.S.) visitors to Yahoo Finance are stagnant
   at shade over 34 million — the same number they were in July 2012.
   Flickr had 25 million (U.S.) users in July 2012 according to comScore,
   a number that had declined to 21.5 million in July 2013.

   Dismiss all that as nitpicking, but you can’t ignore the fact that
   according to research firm EMarketer “Yahoo’s share of global digital
   ad spending is set to decline from 3.37 percent to 3.1 percent this
   year.”

   When I put that forecast against the somewhat ambiguous number of Yahoo
   topping the comScore rankings of most widely used websites I see that
   nothing really has changed. Yahoo’s Weather app uses data from a third
   party and it doesn’t matter how well it does — it can’t create enough
   views and thus create a meaningful revenue stream.

   I am not the only non-believer. “We continue to believe that a
   turnaround of Yahoo’s consolidated operations is a long shot, even if
   Marissa Mayer has improved morale and sharpened Yahoo’s focus on
   product aesthetic, functionality and mobile apps,” wrote Jordan Rohan,
   who follows the company for brokerage, Stifel & Co., in a recent
   research note to his clients. Jordan is being generous.

   Like I told Bloomberg’s Emily Chang, Yahoo’s product lineup sort of
   blows. There isn’t a single product they make that I want to use.

   Yahoo, like most large web companies from the 1990s, gained mass scale
   because it arrived to the party first and moved fast enough to keep
   signing up more and more people. Of course, it helped that there wasn’t
   much competition, especially after the big bubble burst in 2001. Yahoo
   met the needs of a lot of newcomers to the internet by offering simple
   and easy-to-use products. Fast forward to today and we have a whole new
   generation of internet users who have grown up using a plethora of
   services. They understand what is good, what is average and what is
   simply terrible. Yahoo’s offerings for this new class of users aren’t
   that compelling enough to shift their attention to the company.

   yahoo-reflected-in-eye-o

   It is often easy to look at the web services from the perspective of
   the current/past generation of users and get blinded by the big
   numbers, but technology companies have to look forward and make sure
   they capture new classes of users. It is the challenge faced by every
   single consumer products company — brands and products age with their
   early adopters and eventually become worthless. As a knowledgeable man
   recently told me, “Yahoo is like the Fat Elvis” when all of us “want a
   new king of rock-n-roll.” Buying Tumblr is a good move, but again, it’s
   too soon to declare victory.

Mobile first? Actually no, mobile last

   Looking forward, it is pretty clear the world isn’t about the web as we
   know it and instead it is all about the mobile. The good news is that
   Yahoo’s CEO knows that.

   “I hope that at some point we are looking at a world where mobile is a
   majority of our revenue,” Mayer told BusinessWeek writer Brad Stone.
   The bad news is that Yahoo has done nothing to capitalize on that
   opportunity. It has launched some new apps but boy, are they struggling
   in the rankings.

   Take for example the top free 50 iOS apps in the US iTunes App store —
   there is one Yahoo property in there, Tumblr, which cost the company a
   whopping $1 billion. Flickr, whose much ballyhooed rebirth inspired
   headlines across the globe, ranks a mere 39th in the “photos and
   videos” apps. BusinessWeek celebrated Yahoo’s focus on new products and
   design, but someone should look at Yahoo Mail — the font it uses is
   from the 1990s. (Yahoo Mail is ranked at 114 spot on the US iOS App
   Store.) On the US Google Play store, Yahoo Mail is ranked at #19,
   Tumblr at #81 and Yahoo Fantasy Sports League at #109.

   Here is a tiny bit from Bloomberg’s piece about Yahoo.

     Cahan’s division, called Mobile and Emerging Products, now exceeds
     330 people and has its primary offices in New York, San Francisco,
     and Sunnyvale, Calif. Underscoring mobile’s importance, Mayer
     ordered the team’s work space in Sunnyvale renovated. Unlike the
     soporific purple and beige cubiclevilles that fill the rest of
     Yahoo’s dot-com-era headquarters, the mobile group has adjustable
     workstations that let employees sit or stand. There’s an exposed
     ceiling, whiteboards on every other wall, and big colorful posters
     that display giant iPhone screens.

   330 people — you gotta be kidding me! There is one question that needs
   to be asked: what the hell are these people on Yahoo’s mobile team
   doing? What is the daily active user base for Yahoo, and its individual
   products. “We also launched our redesigned Yahoo! app for iOS and
   Android, complete with Summly integration. As a result of this launch,
   we saw 55% increase in daily active users and a 60% increase in time
   spent using the application.” Mayer said during the conference call,
   but how about some actual numbers?

   And while Yahoo management talks about mobile from one side of its
   mouth, they are unable to resist the lurid lucre of web-based
   advertising. Perhaps that is why they are out celebrating the comScore
   top spot and looking at signing up Katie Couric to their web platform,
   just as she signed up Saturday Night Live (SNL) to the Yahoo
   platform.  As I see it, for about the 13th year, Yahoo continues to be
   schizophrenic, torn between its desire to be either a media entity or a
   technology company.

Rotten to the core

   I can sit and talk about in this abstract terms, but the fact is that
   Yahoo’s core is getting completely hollowed out. According to one Wall
   Street analyst, search-based advertising accounts for about 75 percent
   of company’s operating profits, and yet no one seems to notice that
   Yahoo’s share of US search queries has declined from 20.3 percent in
   2009 to 11.3 percent at the end of July 2013. In fact, every month is a
   new low.

   Bing and Ballmer By selling its [DEL: search :DEL] crown jewels —
   search — to Microsoft, the company is more reliant on Microsoft for
   profits than most realize. And all that search-market share loss didn’t
   go to Google, but it has been sucked up by Microsoft’s Bing which now
   accounts for about 18 percent of the total US search queries, according
   to comScore.

   Things are worse on mobile — the company doesn’t even have a double
   digit share of the mobile search market. Mobile (unlike Yahoo on the
   web) search is driven almost entirely by ability to search inside the
   URL/search bar and most people end up using Google as a default option.
   Google owns Android and has done a good job of becoming an important
   part of iOS users’ habits as well. Google’s search is slowly and surely
   moving towards offering intelligent serendipity that can drive a new
   revenue stream from action-oriented advertising, the kind which makes
   sense on mobile platforms.

   Yahoo Weather for iOS In comparison, Yahoo is still dependent on the
   old school page-view driven advertising business model. And even here,
   Yahoo is facing a nightmare situation — thanks to technology in the
   form of programmatic buying. This type of buying is limiting the demand
   of premium advertising that Yahoo has been hawking.

   Yahoo no longer enjoys the monopoly on the massive scale web
   advertising. That mantle has been taken over by Facebook, which, quite
   frankly, has figured out a way to create inventory of billions of page
   views at costs much lower than Yahoo. As a result it offers advertisers
   cheap display advertising but with ability to more effectively pick and
   choose attractive demographics. In other words, with better targeting
   and cheaper prices, why would a display advertiser look at Yahoo over
   Facebook?

   Let’s just face it — there isn’t anything premium about Yahoo
   anymore. By the way, this isn’t just my theory — Yahoo blamed
   programmatic buying for the revenue shortfall in its most recent
   quarter (Q2 2013.) And this is a problem that isn’t going away,
   especially since Facebook, which throws up tens of billions of page
   views daily, has made making money its sole mission.

So why is Yahoo stock up?

   “All of the stock bump is because of increase in the valuation of
   Alibaba,” Ben Schachter, analyst with Macquarie Securities pointed out.
   The positive press and improved image of the company because of Marissa
   has helped the stock. But as far as products are concerned, “we haven’t
   seen much.” He isn’t the only one who is in wait-and-see mode. Other
   analysts too say that there remain substantial challenges.

   While it is easy to say that these things take time, one thing is
   clear: Yahoo doesn’t have time. It doesn’t have time to move at the
   speed of General Motors in the age of Tesla. It has to learn that when
   it comes to the only thing that matters in the world of consumer
   technology — attention — they are losing it to sexier, shinier and
   prettier things.

   And forget the products — so far Yahoo has been unable to attract top
   quality talent to the company. Not one 20-something I have talked to in
   the past six months has wistfully talked about working for Yahoo. And
   even those who have joined Yahoo from Google are joining the company
   thanks to mega-million dollar contracts, not because they want to work
   there. When Yahoo becomes the desired job-spot for a fresh, new tech
   tinkerer — that will be the time I will lighten up on Yahoo.

   And in the interim, I am going to focus all my writing on companies
   actually inventing the future. And if anyone from Yahoo management
   wants to come talk to me, I am all ears and they know where to find me
   — as long as they come with data that shows not only is its audience
   and daily engagement growing, but also its revenues, profits and appeal
   to a new generation of users.

       I was interviewed for Yahoo mobile division (I’m a former
       employee). I brought them a new product idea that was perfect for
       them, scalable to Billions, and a new source of advertising that
       jumped wayyy past Facebook. New, new, new, but just about ready to
       pop.
       They didn’t even listen. Just asking BS little technical quiz
       questions (this was after I specifically asked them not to waste my
       time with quiz questions).
       Whether I got the job or not, didn’t matter. What mattered was
       their utter lack of curiosity about a new mobile segment. They are
       busy playing catch-up with 3 years ago.

       Thanks, Om, for another brilliant article that goes beyond the
       mainstream media’s fascination with Vogue-worthy Marissa Mayer. I
       appreciate your faith in her abilities, but Yahoo! has very little
       to show after her first year at the helm. “Improving employee
       morale” with free meals and iPhones has not resulted in any
       meaningful products for today’s digital audience.
       In my view as a stockholder and six-year, bleed-purple veteran of
       Yahoo! Media (now happily elsewhere), Mayer has squandered the
       jewel of Yahoo’s once-excellent content and fallen into its old
       “technology company” trap. She has abdicated her responsibility for
       Yahoo’s content to self-entitled, unqualified lower managers — with
       the results already apparent on Yahoo’s dumbed-down Front Page and
       celebrity-obsessed Entertainment properties. I worry about the
       future of News, Finance and Sports.
       Meanwhile, by adopting the timeworn conundrum that “Yahoo! is a
       technology company,” Mayer fell into the trap that made Yahoo such
       a technological also-ran. Yahoo has never learned that technology
       has to be in service to the end user, not an end in itself.
       Consumers don’t go to Web sites for technology; they visit for the
       content and “stuff” that the technology delivers. Ross Levinsohn
       knew that — and Mayer should know it from Google. But all we get
       are a cool Weather app and redesigns of obsolete properties.

       I have a feeling (but I am not an expert on big-ass companies) that
       Yahoo lacks vision.As an example – they had a huge opportunity with
       Flickr, they just gave it a facelift and a bigger room, but it’s
       doesn’t have any more value over what was there 5 – 7 years ago.
       Other web sites stepped in and took over some of it, but some of
       the value is still on the table – yet Yahoo can’t even grab that.

       same page when it comes to Mayer being an awesome leader.
       How much time do you think is right for a turnaround of a company
       which is “Yahoo with all the over hang you have mentioned” lead by
       some one like Mayer? How about a post on how Yahoo should do what
       with each product or business for a turn around?

       You are only as good as your last innovation. Yahoo basically has
       none of it’s own, and hasn’t done much with the ones it bought, and
       overpaid for.
       I have very fond memories of Yahoo, but now my interest is almost
       entirely in watching if MM can do something spectacular to save the
       company. In other words, my interest is in her, not really Yahoo,
       at least until they release something that creates or moves a new
       market.

       There’s also a fairly transparent, tell-don’t-show nature to the
       way they are trying to project a sense of “renewal”. Average
       consumers don’t care and amateur observers can see through it
       (i.e., a rise in stock price and an influx of talent being
       supported by Alibaba’s valuation).
       There’s no PR effort more transparent than their off-the-mark “30
       Days of Change” campaign:

       Thanks for this informative piece. I’m sure she is talented but she
       essentially condemned the internet when she killed work-from-home.
       She (and her head of HR) said that communication, speed, quality,
       collaboration, organizing, trust, teamwork, and monitoring all
       suffer and that misunderstandings and costs increase when employees
       work from home.
       Then, cutting even deeper, Meyer said, â€œIt is difficult for
       humans to trust people that they don’t frequently see face to
       face.â€
       Your CEO is damning the internet?!
       Where is the article that says Yahoo is cutting new ground to make
       working from home even more effective?

       Honestly Yahoo! just needs to look at USA today or Quartz and turn
       their old fashion home into something sexy.
       Honestly also have you seen how horrible the purple yahoo menu bar
       looks over the black flick menubar (and why 2 menubars also??).
       Yahoo is not sexy neither appealing!

       Maybe, just maybe, Yahoo!’s stock has also been helped by the
       rather large increase in efficiency. Yahoo hasn’t really gained
       anything in terms of revenue, but profit is up at a good margin.
       That’s business 101. Before you worry too much about growing
       revenue, make sure you capitalize on the revenues you have. If you
       can do that, it opens the door to higher quality products. It’s a
       process. Why acquire all this small companies? Because many of them
       are efficient, and those gains in efficiency directly translate to
       real dollars.
       This isn’t the only reason, but it’s definitely on the mind of many
       after the last earnings call.
       Another big reason that you touch on is the movement. At this point
       in the game it doesn’t matter where the movement is happening, the
       fact that a company like Yahoo! is making these changes is a rather
       big deal. If you pay closer attention you will realize the primary
       objective of all these moves: being nimble. Marissa Mayer is
       dead-set on making Yahoo! one of the most agile large web
       properties out. Putting them in position to capitalize not on
       current opportunities, but ones that one turn up for 5 or 10 years.
       Sprucing up what you have no isn’t a bad idea, but if you really
       want to grow and you’re Yahoo, you need to set yourself up for what
       is coming not what’s already here.
       That’s what they’re doing. And that’s why their stock will keep
       going up over the next 6 quarters. As long as they remain on this
       path I see good things for them. They will be competitive again.
       And this is coming from someone who doesn’t use Yahoo! (Google).
       Game recognize game as some would say.

       You talk oodles about the CEO…when the CEO spends billions to buy
       crappy sites run by rich teenagers in UK and some stupid site
       called tumblr used to distribute porn , and in this day and age
       calls WFH a crime…. What else can you expect. Lets be honest ,
       Meyer is no genius CEO.in fact I liked the college dropout CEO
       better and I thnk he had some real balls and could turn around
       yahoo if given a chance.

       “It is about Yahoo loyalists and their inability to look beyond the
       esoteric and frankly worthless metric; the 700 million people who
       use Yahoo each month. That is a blivet full of 15 year old
       excrement.”
       Directly from the GigaOm About Us page….
       “Since 2006, GigaOM has grown into the leading independent voice on
       emerging technologies and the disruption of media. The GigaOM news
       networkâ€™s online audience of 5.5 million monthly unique readers
       relies on its definitive coverage of cloud, mobile, cleantech,
       consumer web and media.”
       If 700 million is worthless, how does 5.5 million make a leading
       independent voice?

       I suggest some proofreading:
       “By selling its search crown jewels â€” search â€” to Microsoft,
       the company is more reliant on Microsoft for profits than most
       realize.”
       Or maybe the author thought the word ‘search’ belonged twice in
       that sentence.
       And on the article content? Based on what I know about Yahoo (not
       much), the arguments and data backing them are compelling.

       Can you elaborate on the impact Alibaba’s assets have on Yahoo’s US
       stock price / overall traffic numbers? Two additional follow-up
       questions:
       1. What is a reasonable time horizon to measure the success of
       Yahoo’s M&A activities over the past 2 quarters?
       2. Do you see Yahoo giving up the US market and focusing on China?
       Basically, the Yahoo identity decreasing and Alibaba identity
       increasing.

            details.
            On the M&A activities — just see how soon the people who
            joined via M&A leave. If they leave sooner, then they are in
            trouble
            On US vs China, they are going to be non-player in China from
            the looks of it.

                 Thanks Om. I did read the Loeb article. I guess I didn’t
                 frame my question correctly.
                 I wanted to ask if you have direct visibility or opinions
                 on specific Alibaba products that will have an impact on
                 Yahoo’s worldwide traffic numbers. Right now, most
                 literature I’ve come across presents Alibaba as a black
                 box and projects a future based as a function of Yahoo’s
                 % ownership of Alibaba, not from actual user, traffic or
                 revenue numbers. Asset sales contributed the majority of
                 Yahoo’s cash flow in the previous year, so I’m wondering
                 how they plan to keep momentum going with a shrunken
                 asset base and with assets outside the US.
                 Interesting thought on the M&A, don’t most companies have
                 a mandatory lock-in period for acquired staff? I’d assume
                 folks would be loathe to break these golden handcuffs and
                 walk away.

       Everyone in the tech industry lionizes Marissa Mayer, but I have
       yet to see evidence that she’s some monster genius. I’ll just have
       to take your word for it, Om.
       Meanwhile, we’ll just have to wait for the new Yahoo! logo. That’ll

       This article was extremely frustrating to read:
       “(Yahoo Mail is ranked at 114 spot on the US iOS App Store.) On the
       US Google Play store, Yahoo Mail is ranked at #19, Tumblr at #81
       and Yahoo Fantasy Sports League at #109.”
       ARE YOU SERIOUS? These numbers are freakishly misleading because it
       reports them in overall app rankings, but instead we should be
       looking at them by each category in which they are published. For
       example:
       Yahoo! Mail (Productivity category): #5
       Yahoo! Weather (Weather category): #2
       Yahoo! Sports (Sports category): #13
       Yahoo! Fantasy Football (Sports category): #2
       (these ranks are as of of Aug 22, 2013 on iOS App Store, U.S.)
       ..the list goes on, but you see what I’m trying to say here? This
       article is written by a total nonsense skeptic.
       Enjoy,

            Free App category (overall) is the right way to look at the

            1.Google Gmail at #22 overall not in some special productivity
            category.
            2. Instagram #7 overall, not some special photos category.
            3. Weather Channel #92 overall.
            Tell you what you have
            Tumblr and Yahoo Fantasy Sports app — 52 and 67 overall — of
            which one cost $1 billion.
            I am glad the company has a lot of believers like you — it
            needs that blind support. I am not a believer and I am a
            skeptic — why don’t you guys prove me wrong. Simple

            Yahoo is doomed with their current direction in mobile. Their
            â€œfeedbackâ€ link is overwhelmingly filled with boisterous
            complaints about their â€œnewâ€ approach in mobile where they
            lock in floating yahoo toolbars taking up a significant
            portion of your phone and tablet screen with no ability to
            remove it in settings. Users are screaming at them online,
            even begging them to remove it, yet all are ignored. Moronic
            lack of attention to customer satisfction and user experience.
            Then when one reads the user comments posted to their own
            yahoo new articles you realize their market share appears to
            be populated in large part by the very bottom of the market.

       One of the “core” products they are applauded for is Yahoo Fantasy
       Football. If Yahoo were investing in its core successes, its
       fantasy app would not have auto-drafted Aaron Hernandez as my TE in
       the 6th round last night, more than a month after he was locked up
       on murder charges and released from his team. There are dozens of
       other players not on any roster for months who still appear in the
       Yahoo Fantasy league. This is not that hard for a company with
       Yahoo’s resources who wants to show that they care about investing
       in their “successful” products.
       Disclosure: I sold Yahoo short this morning after discovering they
       had auto-drafted Aaron Hernandez onto my team last night.

       Great piece, Om.
       I’m always so confused by the contrast between Marissa Mayer’s
       philosophy/aesthetic — clean, helpful, classy, non-evil — and the
       Yahoo! frontpage — Kardassians permanently in the top stories, junk
       stories almost indistinguishable from fake sponsored stories. . . .
       It seems like they are too afraid of losing traffic to tinker with
       improving quality, leaving them, like you say, stuck with their
       existing, dwindling market segment.
       While it should still be a platform with a lot of upside,
       especially with the right M&A, I agree that the potential is still
       more unproven than shown.

            meaning and remember I grew up with that page/design and loved
            using it as a service.
            That said, MM has great aesthetic and good taste. I have seen

SumUp adds American Express to its mobile point-of-sale terminal roster

   And so the European mobile point-of-sale (POS) terminal wars continue.
   With iZettle, Payleven, Adyen, mPowa and SumUp all trying to replicate
   Square’s dongle-based model in the EU, the various stages in this
   scramble for the mobile merchant tend to involve the signing of
   distribution partnerships or the support of new cards or card
   technologies.

   Yesterday it was iZettle adding chip-and-pin capabilities — as happened
   earlier this month with Payleven — and partnering up with Banco
   Santander, and today it’s SumUp’s newfound support for American
   Express(s axp) cards.

   SumUp is still working on the technical implementation for the deal,
   and its merchants will start being able to take payments from AmEx
   cardholders in the second quarter of the year in the UK, Germany,
   Ireland, Austria, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Belgium and
   Portugal should follow, though SumUp is still in negotiations with
   American Express on that point.

   This is not the first such firm to sign with AmEx – after all, American
   Express has actively invested in iZettle. However, according to SumUp,
   the deal means the company “will accept more types of cards in more
   regions than any other mobile point-of-sale technology provider
   worldwide”. Co-founder Stefan Jeschonnek told me SumUp has “several
   tens of thousands of merchants” now using its terminals, and “several
   thousand” are joining each week.

   SumUp does have an extra trick up its sleeve, too: later this year it
   will be bringing out the slightly Square Wallet-ish SumUp Pay, which
   will let end-users pre-approve a participating merchant through an app,
   then pop up on that merchant’s system as soon as they walk into their
   shop – the idea there is to allow purchases based on a simple verbal
   interaction with the merchant, without the need for even taking the
   phone out.

   And according to Jeschonnek, SumUp will be able to exploit its growing
   installed base of merchants to crack the classic chicken-and-egg
   problem associated with mobile wallet schemes:

     “We’re making payments smoother today with the card reader, but
     we’re thinking about how things should work in the future. We are
     building technology to make that real-world interaction possible
     again… The difference this time around is that we already have a
     pretty large and fast-growing merchant base. For our merchants to
     accept SumUp Pay will be as simple as updating their app.”

   He added that SumUp Pay would also provide a nifty way around Visa’s
   stringent authentication procedures, which have previously proved a
   stumbling block for the likes of iZettle, when it launches later this
   year.

   It’s good to see companies innovating in the financial technology
   space, and SumUp’s focus on in-house technological development
   theoretically places it well there. That said, with the mobile POS wars
   as heated as they are in Europe right now, I would not be in the least
   bit surprised to see a rival try to beat SumUp to its frictionless
   payment goal.

       For me when it comes to MPOS, i think mPowa (www.mpowa.com) will
       reach more consumers this 2013. The company already started with
       global credit card compatibility, unlike other MPOS providers, they
       only get permissions just now.
