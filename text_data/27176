About

   The WATA conferences cover all aspects of weighted automata, ranging
   from the theory of quantitative automata and logics to applications for
   real-time systems and natural language processing. The aim is to
   present tutorials and survey lectures by outstanding scientists in this
   area. Moreover, we encourage everybody to participate in this workshop
   and to present their own technical contribution in this area.

   There will be a special issue of TCS-A devoted to the topic of this

   contain original research on weighted automata or tightly related
   areas. Participation in WATA 2016 is encouraged, but will not be a
   prerequisite for a submission. All submissions will be refereed
   according to the usual high journal standards.
