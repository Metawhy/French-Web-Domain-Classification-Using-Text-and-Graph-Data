Slow Snacking or Fast Casual Dining: You can eat healthy AND quickly!

Today, “fast” is a key word for many people: the clock is ticking and things
must get done quickly. It is in this context that fast food appeared, with
the consumer’s need to eat quickly.

   Caught up in healthy eating, slow snacking & fast casual dining.

Fast services : a key and harmless factor

   Slow snacking restaurant spend a lot of time looking for quality
   products available at greengrocers. This is were the word "slow comes
   from. The service is still very quick.
   Do people like eating fast and unhealthy food? Studies say no. After
   their rapid evolution, fast-food restaurants today face the health and
   environmental problems they offer. Quality is too often left aside in
   favor of quantity. It is how a new concept appeared: Fast Casual
   dining, or high-end fast food. The objective is clear: it advertises
   higher quality and more eco-friendly food choices than traditional fast
   food restaurants.
   The leading entrepreneur of this movement in France is Alain Cojean.
   Former director of research and development at McDonald's, he noticed
   the gap that exists and the changing trends. In 2001, he founded the
   Cojean restaurant chain. On the menu: sandwiches, soups, salads, etc.
   but above all, a response to current trends with organic products and
   gluten-free choices.
   For consumers, this concept seems like the optimum solution at a time
   when environmental and 'junk food' problems are growing. Contrary to
   popular belief for years, it is actually possible to eat fast and
   healthy. Feeling good while and after eating healthy products and not
   wasting any time is a nice feeling right? Environmental awareness is
   also demonstrated: offering homemade dishes, healthy products or
   favoring short supply chains such as “locavorism”: eating food which is
   grown in less than a 250km radius. These trends are a win-win for
   restaurants and consumers.

The increase in price is fully justified by the increase in quality

   It is more expensive to eat in a slow snacking or fast-casual
   restaurant: this is a fact. But is the economic criterion really what
   matters today? According to Bernard Boutboul, General Manager of Gira
   Conseil, the answer is no. For 25-40 year olds, the target group of
   this new concept, the health factor takes precedence over the price
   factor. He explains that many people are ready to spend more money in
   addition to their meal voucher, for quality products. For example, at
   Cojean, the average bill is around 25 euros and 10 euros at McDonald's.
   Cojean now has 25 restaurants in Paris, which is a symbol of his
   success in the snacking industry.

   The price increase is indeed justifiable: cooking 100% homemade dishes
   with fresh and local products is more expensive than importing frozen
   products in large quantities. However, this rise in prices provides an
   opportunity for improvements: for example, buying products from a local
   store may be more expensive, but it will reduce the costs of imports
   and environmental consequences. Also, many consumers are aware that
   paying more can actually have a very positive impact.

A powerful market in the midst of development

   The snack market is changing: the consumer’s desire for quality opens
   the door to many shopkeepers, especially food-related professionals
   (butchers, greengrocers, bakers, fishmongers). These companies
   represent a turnover of 25 million euros, but which tends to decrease.
   However, Gira Conseil notes that some establishments choose to offer
   food on-the-go in order to attract more customers. For example,
   bakeries make more than 40% of their turnover thanks to sandwiches and
   food to go. This figure has risen steadily over the past 10 years.

   Today, this current trend opens up a new high-growth market for food
   businesses. The quality is present in their ingredients. Now they must
   adapt their range of food on-the-go choices and the way in which they
   distribute them in order to reach target customers. Depending on their
   activities, they can offer breakfast, lunch or dinner in addition to
   morning snacks and finger food items. For example, the butcher shop 'Au
   fin Gourmet' in Merignac offers meals available for take-away or
   delivery. These two different options allow them to sell their meat in
   a different way and allow customers to enjoy meat directly from a
   butcher shop.

   Slow snacking and fast casual dining enter the market thanks to the
   increased demand from consumers. The challenge will now be for
   businesses to find a way to adapt their range of products to a market
   different from the one they are used to.

Food on the go : how does it fit in this new market?

   A new market opening up to food-related professionals and new
   entrepreneurs requires good organization.Here are some of our tips to
   shed some light on this topic:

     * Firstly, it is imperative to show potential customers that you are
       in business: whether it is by setting up tables for customers to
       use or signs for takeaway food, your establishment should be
       visible. Feel free to set up display cases so that customers can
       see the items you are selling.

     * Then, make it known that you offer fresh and healthy products. It's
       about winning customers’ trust so they will want to come back.

     * Food on-the-go has a few rules, so it’s important to adapt.
       Packaging for takeaway meals and various menu options are
       particularly important points for customers.

     * Finally, develop new ways of selling your products. For example,
       the “click & collect” system (when the customer orders before
       coming to get his or her meal) is very popular because it saves
       time for the shopkeeper and the customer.

   As you can see, the development of these new concepts is part of a
   society in which we want to adopt better, yet faster, consumption
   patterns.

The organization of a gala asks for large-scale project management

Geoffrey Pédemay (President) and Andy Gallo (in charge of marketing) provide
valuable advice on the organization of the Gala. They also look back on their
year as members of the Student Office. Interview.

   Return
   (BUTTON) Read more

The gala is one of the Student Office’s major annual events. What is it
exactly?

   Andy Gallo: The gala is an event bringing together the entire Vatel
   Bordeaux community: students, professors, academic team partners.

What are the major steps in organizing the gala?

   Geoffrey Pédemay : It is important to mention that we had access to 5
   years of gala archives, which allowed us to have a solid reference.

   Without doubt, we must:
     * First, choose a theme for the gala, making sure it has not been
       taken already. Most importantly, it must please the greatest number
       of people. So we will put together a poll.
     * Then we must choose a date by taking into account the schedule of
       when students are expected begin and finish their internships for
       the two terms (April and September) The academic department passed
       it on to us very quickly.
     * Create a marketing strategy. This allows us to set up a countdown
       checklist of the tasks to be done until the day-of and day after
       the event.
     * Choosing the venue is the third step. It must meet several
       criteria: Match the chosen theme in terms of atmosphere and
       location.
     * Meet the standards for public safety.
     * Fit into our projected budget.

   It is important to confirm these steps for the organization of the gala
   as soon as possible. After the venue has been determined, we can start
   to look for partners and launch a large-scale marketing strategy for
   example.

Let's go back to the different points discussed. What does your countdown
checklist look like?

   G.P: Here is our checklist for the key steps:
     * Late April - early May: gala evening
     * Mid-April: final number of partners
     * Early March: last deadline for booking a venue
     * Late December: confirmation of the theme
     * November: launch of the poll to choose the evening's theme

How did you build and finance the budget for the 2018 gala and what is the
amount?

   G.P: We drew on the expertise of our predecessors because cost items
   remain the same. Chloé Cassagne, who runs the Student Affairs
   Department and who has been treasurer of a Student Office, tells us
   about the right expense amount and what is possible or not in terms of
   disbursement. As soon as we ask for a document, she sends it to us. The
   total budget is over €21,000. Each participant is required to pay a €45
   fee to help pay for the organization costs.

What is your marketing strategy to bring as many people as possible to the
gala?

   A.G: We have published three posts a week about the gala since April.
   All posts on the Student Office Facebook page are written in French and
   English, which is something new this year. The same thing goes for our
   snaps. We use Snapchat for live events and for reminders 2 hours before
   an event.

   Yoann Manji (Mi2A) is in charge of writing in English, one of the
   official languages of Kenya, Yoann's home country. He uses typical
   expressions that tend to engage people from different countries more.
   He is assisted by Stefan Schwartzl (Mi2A). Two other members of the
   Student Office come from international classes: Julie Deschamps (Mi2A),
   Bérénice Stavarasky (Mi2A).

   The proportion of international students attending Student Office
   events is 40%, which is twice as much as last year.

Which part of the organization of a gala do you need to pay special attention
to?

   G.P: Safety! This year, like last year, there will be security guards
   from a private company at the main entrance points. A Red Cross stand
   will be present in case of injury or discomfort. Finally this year,
   buses will be available from midnight to 5am to shuttle people from the
   gala venue to the school.

What would you say to convince students who are on the fence about joining
the Student Office?

   G.P: It is an honor to represent Vatel Bordeaux! By being part of the
   Student Office, you will see all the value and strength of Vatel's
   program.Your legal culture courses will help you deal with the legal
   requirements when organizing the gala. Your intercultural management
   courses will suddenly take on new meaning when building a strong team
   with peers from different cultures.Becoming involved in the
   organization of the gala gives you real project management experience
   with its economic, legal, marketing, human dimensions.

   A.G: You will enjoy a powerful and rewarding experience. You will have
   to reach out to other students and make new friends.

   Become a member of the Student Office and you’re sure to have a very
   rewarding year. Look no further!

   Creating a hotel: instruction manual - Vatel

Creating a hotel: instruction manual

Are you dreaming of opening your own hotel? It’s possible, but you have to be
prepared. Don’t worry, we’re here to walk you through it.

   Return
   (BUTTON) Read more

The typology of the hotel market must not have any secrets for you

   This will give you a precise idea of the hotel you’d like to
   open. There are:

     * Independent hotels: they represent 80% of the hotel industry in
       France.

     * Hotel chains: This share only represents 20% of the French market,
       as opposed to what you could imagine. Nonetheless, chains have a
       room capacity that is three times as large as that of independent
       hotels.

   Do you want to open a branded hotel (Accor, Best Western, Holiday Inn,
   etc.) or on the contrary, open an independent hotel? Any why not open a
   hotel-restaurant or a hotel in a foreign country?
   Same thing about the atmosphere you want your hotel to have. Will the
   hotel have a label or not?

   Now we’re done, you’ve decided on the structure your hotel will have.
   It’s a good beginning, but now we must look at the other aspects you
   cannot neglect.

The financial dimension: your business plan, a key document to check the
profitability of your project

   Now it’s time to write your hotel’s business plan. A business plan is a
   detailed document with two goals:
     * Allowing you to check if your project is financially viable, at
       least on paper
     * Being the reference document when seeking funding

   A hotel’s business plan schematically has two important parts:
     * One part where you detail your project: employees, the market
       study, services you will provide, your sales strategy, etc.
     * One part with figures that will justify your need for funding, and
       above all, the potential profitability of your project.

Regulatory aspects: a riddle we’ve solved for you

   There are many rules and regulations to comply with when you want to
   create a hotel; here are a few of them.
     * In France, you must obtain an authorization to open your hotel from
       your department’s prefecture.
     * The hotel must respect strict safety standards as it receives
       public, as a hotel is classified in France as an ERP building
       (building receiving public).
     * If the hotel owner would like to have a star classification (this
       is not mandatory), he or she must contact Atout France and request
       a control visit from a COFRAC accredited organization.
     * And last but not least, if the hotel will be selling beverages, and
       especially alcoholic beverages, it must obtain a license for this.

   No special degrees are needed to open a hotel, though most hotel owners
   have had specific training to ensure the sustainability of their
   projects.

The legal structure: a key stage in your hotel projects

   According to the legal structure you would like your hotel to have
   (SARL, SA, SAS, etc.), there will be other additional constraints.

   This means that deciding on your hotel’s legal structure is a crucial
   step, as this decision, among others of course, will impact the
   governance of your company, your responsibility towards its debts in
   the case of bankruptcy, your social regime as its manager, and the way
   it will be taxed.

   Deciding to open your hotel abroad or in some protected zones (Zone for
   the Protection of Architectural, Urban, and Landscape Heritage or
   ZPPAUP) is also a source of supplementary and specific regulatory
   constraints. Make sure that you take this into account right from the
   very beginning of your project.

Human and material dimensions: don’t neglect these

   After you’ve chosen your hotel’s concept, you’ve decided where it will
   be located, and its legal structure, it’s now time to think about the
   human and material resources you’ll need to open your hotel.

   Before this, you’ll have to manage the decoration of your facilities,
   and do this work before opening your hotel.

   You generally must plan on large investments at the beginning:

     * The rooms: furniture, bedding, decorations, bathrooms, linen, room
       access-control
     * The front desk: the desk itself, computer terminal equipment,
       payment terminals
     * Shared facilities: bathrooms, armchairs, decoration, safety
       equipment, etc.
     * Depending on the hotel’s standing and services: bar equipment, the
       kitchens, the restaurant, pool, spa, etc.
     * Equipment for the changing rooms for employees, administrative
       offices, purchasing material for maintenance and cleaning, etc.
     * Material for advertising: an internet site, an illuminated sign,
       other signs, etc.
     * Maintenance and renovation expenses can also be quite high: linen
       to be purchased, carpets to be changed, painting to be redone, etc.

   The friendliness and professional conduct of the hotel’s employees is
   another key aspect that you can never neglect, as it strongly impacts
   the success of your hotel. Human resource needs will depend on the size
   of your hotel and services it will be providing.

   Minimizing the importance of the human factor in a hotel project would
   be a serious mistake, even more so if your project is not backed by a
   hotel chain. Major hotel chains have strict standards and enjoy a
   reputation that will ensure the success of a project. In the opposite
   case, training your teams, motivating them, their experience and the
   quality of your management will be the keys to services that your
   guests will expect, as well as what you yourself are also expecting.In
   a nutshell, knowing who to hire and how to motivate your personnel are
   aspects that are as important as those that will follow.

   [1524134358-e5nyv9.jpg]

The marketing dimension: your market study, an indispensable tool to confirm
your hospitality industry project

   To open a hotel, you must carry out a market study, to check if your
   project is a commercially viable one and define the optimal sales
   strategy that you will put in place down the road.

   A hotel’s market study must include extensive research on the current
   trends in the industry, a detailed analysis of the economic
   competition, as well as a study of the potential client base.

   You must be informed about the economic environment in the market in
   the country where you want to open your hotel.

   For information, France remains the world’s top tourist destination. In
   2016, the hospitality industry suffered because of the terrorist
   attacks. The two regions which attract the largest number of tourists,
   Ile-de-France and the French Riviera, where particularly impacted.

   This is also a sector which is in the midst of change with a large
   “uberization” level:
     * Alternative methods of accommodations, and in particular platforms
       which target individual housing such as Airbnb or Homelidays are
       become more popular and creating heavy competition for hotels;
     * Reservation centers such as Booking.com or Expedia have also
       undergone an exponential development: this allows hospitality
       professionals to improve their room turnover but forces them to pay
       heavy additional commissions.

Essential communication and commercial dimensions: to ensure the success of
your hotel

   To make your hotel profitable, you’ll need a good and efficient
   marketing plan to make yourself known, and then to ensure customer
   loyalty.

   As more and more reservations are now done online, controlling your
   digital reputation has become completely indispensable: having a
   high-performing internet site is now necessary and knowing what is
   being said about you online has also become vital.

   Don’t neglect social networks and sites with online comments
   (especially TripAdvisor, as well as comparative sites (Trivago, Kayak,
   etc.) and reservation platforms (Booking, hotel.com, etc.).

   You can also promote your hotel in more traditional ways, by signing
   partnerships with decision-makers in the tourism industry: travel
   agencies, tourist bureaus, guides such as Lonely Planet or the Guide du
   Routard.

In conclusion, now it’s up to you!

   I’m sure you’ve understood that being prepared is the most important
   aspect. Creation of a hotel must be methodical and include all the
   dimensions mentioned above to allow you to have a project that is
   completely viable. But don’t forget, that above all, creating your
   hotel must be a pleasure. Don’t forget this creative aspect. Your
   project must be unique. It highlights the values you have, and you are
   the one and only person who can give it the trend you’re looking for.

   An introduction to Mexican gastronomy - Vatel

An introduction to Mexican gastronomy

Claudia Verver y Vargas, who teaches corporate strategy at Vatel Bordeaux,
was born in Mexico and tells us more about Mexican gastronomy, which is a
part of Unesco’s cultural heritage, for Tables Vatel’s Mexican Week.

   Return
   (BUTTON) Read more

Where does your passion for cooking come from?

   From my grandmother. We go there every Saturday. She loves
   cooking.There were thirty of us last Christmas. I love cooking tasty
   dishes and I also love sharing them with others.

What do you appreciate about Mexican gastronomy?

   It’s wealth. In just one dish, you’ve got all of Mexico’s history: from
   pre-Spanish influence up to the Spanish, colonial and modern times.

Take our taste buds on a trip. What is your favorite Mexican dish?

   Cochinita pibil!Its a pork-based dish made with bitter orange juice and
   achiote (a slightly spicy red herb).That gives your dishes a sweet side
   without too much caramelization. At the end, you pull the meat apart
   and put it into tacos and serve it with a salad of red onions and
   pickles that were marinated in lime juice. And you can’t forget habereo
   peppers, which are tiny, very hot, and personify the South of Mexico.
   You cook this on low heat.Back in the olden days, this preparation was
   heated up in a banana leaf buried underground. As it’s really hot, this
   leaf played the role of an oven at low temperature. Everyone’s got
   their own recipe. For instance, my grandmother added tomatoes.

Which wine would be good with Cochinita pibil?

   I would recommend a dry white wine, Chenin Blanc de le Casa Modero.

And your favorite dessert?

   Capirotada, which is a dessert people in Mexico really like, especially
   during Lent. It’s a type of Mexican pudding, made from bolillos, which
   is a type of Mexican bread. We then add spices and piloncillo.
   Piloncillo is a type of sugar, more precisely, a piece of solid sugar
   cane juice.That goes back to inhabitants of the pre-Spanish era and
   that’s how they sweetened their food. We do the same thing.

You’ve headed several projects. What advice would you give to a young Vatel
alumnus who would like to open a restaurant in Mexico, for instance?

   I’d repeat what I tell my Vatel Bordeaux students in my Corporate
   Strategy course.If you’ve only got a hammer as a tool, for you
   everything will be a nail. That means that each and every detail is
   important. Moreover, this is a very competitive market in Mexico
   because of internationalization and its 25 million inhabitants. You
   must be creative, and not necessarily follow what’s working right now.
   Last but not least, compared with France, regulations and expenses are
   quite a bit lower. This makes things easier. On the other hand,
   however, there’s not the same social protection.

Tell us about the Tables Vatel Mexican Week.

   It’s a week targeting Mexican gastronomy. Mexican artists such as Ivan
   Torres, a well-known painter and Jano Arios, a very talented musician,
   take part in it. Mexican gastronomy is not forgotten with special
   Mexican Accord Parfait evenings and Sunday brunches. And Mexican wines
   and traditional spirits (Tequila Mezcal) are hits in afterwork events.
   There’s something for everyone.

One question about current events. Now hamburgers have replaced ham
sandwiches as the most popular sandwich in France. How do you explain this
change?

   Before, you could only get hamburgers in fast-food restaurants, but
   today nearly all restaurants have them (85%). Customers are looking for
   quality dishes with good products, but also inexpensive ones, even if
   this means having less to eat. And a lot of efforts have recently been
   made to increase traceability of products, especially for meat. So, the
   success of the hamburger can be explained by these latest trends.

Another trend, meat substitution products that look like meat, taste and feel
like meat, but are of vegetal origin. What’s your opinion on them?

   The jury is still out here. These substitution products are useful to
   feed the world’s population, but they don’t replace a good steak!

How did you begin to work at the Marriott International in London ?

   After I graduated from Vatel Bordeaux, I went to Australia for six
   months to improve my English and it was a good idea. I was a waitress
   in a Pullman, but I wanted to have a high-responsibility job.
   Unfortunately, in Australia it’s hard to get one when you only have a
   vacation-work visa. It was much easier to do this in London. The
   manager who hired me had studied at Vatel Lyon a few years before, so
   the Vatel network helped me. I really like working for this large
   luxury hotel group.

And why ?

   And that will allow me to do my next project: going abroad in a city
   where the sun shines more than it does in London!

What are your missions ?

   My role is to:

     * Supervise my team so they’ll give the best service to obtain the
       best possible satisfaction rate! I’ve got to keep them motivated,
       make sure everything is going well for my guests and my team.

     * Assist my manager for HR missions: recruitment, training my team,
       managing orders and payments, creating schedules, etc. He went on
       vacation for ten days and during this time, for instance, I was
       completely in charge of the lounge.

     * Making our lounge attractive for our clients with a maximum of
       innovations.

What do you mean exactly by making our lounge attractive for our clients with
a maximum of innovations ?

   We made a lot of changes with the Chef. Especially the diversity of the
   breakfast buffet, for example. Now each day we propose different
   dishes. We also change the vegetables: grilled vegetables, mushrooms,
   etc. And we also change the flavors of our yogurts, our cold-cuts, etc.
   Our customers really appreciate this diversity.

And in your opinion, how do you motivate colleagues ?

   It’s important for me to have a good atmosphere in my team. I spend
   time with them, listen to them when needed. I’ve also put challenges in
   place with gifts for the person who sells the most cocktails, or the
   person that our customers mention the most. For instance, the person
   who sells the most cocktails wins a voucher for two cocktails in one of
   the trendiest bars in the city.

How do you carry out your team training sessions ?

   When I start, I explain to them how to do their missions and show them
   the example. Then I give them a goal, explain why this is necessary and
   validate a means to measure results together. And after that I support
   them until they are self-confident and let them do their jobs, helping
   them if they need it.

How did your education help you in your life and your current job ?

   It allowed me to acquire all the basics of my current job.

What memories do you keep of Vatel Bordeaux ?

   Very good ! Particularly because Mr Christophe Coulomme, the Corporate
   Relations Director of Vatel Bordeaux helped me a lot to find my
   interns.
