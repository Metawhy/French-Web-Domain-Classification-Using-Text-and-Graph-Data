Scottish Witchfinder

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-09-24%2Bat%2B4.55.26%2BPM.jpg]
   Nearly four thousand people were accused of witchcraft in Scotland
   between 1563 and 1736; nearly 85 percent were women. The University of
   Edinburgh’s online Witches Map is an internship project that visualizes
   where the accused lived, where they were detained, where they were put
   on trial, and where they died, when that data is available.
