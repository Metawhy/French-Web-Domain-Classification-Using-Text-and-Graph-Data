   We conduct research on proof processing systems and more specifically
   on:
     * Dedukti, a backend for various proof systems based on the
       λΠ-calculus modulo,
     * Interoperability of proof systems using Dedukti,
     * The λΠ-calculus modulo and Deduction modulo,
     * Automated deduction in Deduction modulo,
     * The termination and confluence of typed higher-order rewrite
       systems.
