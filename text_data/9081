   Area Maintenance tech (Current Employee) –  Kissimmee, FL – September
   11, 2019
   A particular day at work usually is very interesting; giving me the
   opportunity to provide solutions to the different needs of the
   workplace. At the same time it's a day on which I get to learn new ways
   of providing solutions to the issues that arise. Being able to manage
   critical desicions to complete a designated task and at the same time
   make our staff and customers feel whole. The hardest or my job would be
   lacking the resources needed to satisfy the customer.

   Good Experience
   Front Desk (Former Employee) –  South Beach, FL – October 17, 2018
   I start working at Ocean Blue Hostel as a part time job. The experience
   in general is good.
   What I like the most:
   I have benefits on the schedule, being able to choose my days off or
   being able to take holidays.
   I like the people who work at the hostel, is a nice job environment
   What I don't like:
   The work gets too routinely, there is no space to do an extra.
   The fact the hostel is on top of a bar on Ocean Drive push me
   constantly to kick people from the lobby or not allow people to check
   in. This have became a little dangerous for me when working at night
   and I don't see the point to put myself in that situation.

   Area Maintenance tech (Current Employee) –  Kissimmee, FL – September
   11, 2019
   A particular day at work usually is very interesting; giving me the
   opportunity to provide solutions to the different needs of the
   workplace. At the same time it's a day on which I get to learn new ways
   of providing solutions to the issues that arise. Being able to manage
   critical desicions to complete a designated task and at the same time
   make our staff and customers feel whole. The hardest or my job would be
   lacking the resources needed to satisfy the customer.

   Good Experience
   Front Desk (Former Employee) –  South Beach, FL – October 17, 2018
   I start working at Ocean Blue Hostel as a part time job. The experience
   in general is good.
   What I like the most:
   I have benefits on the schedule, being able to choose my days off or
   being able to take holidays.
   I like the people who work at the hostel, is a nice job environment
   What I don't like:
   The work gets too routinely, there is no space to do an extra.
   The fact the hostel is on top of a bar on Ocean Drive push me
   constantly to kick people from the lobby or not allow people to check
   in. This have became a little dangerous for me when working at night
   and I don't see the point to put myself in that situation.

   This job isn't worth a look
   Cook (Former Employee) –  McDonough, GA – July 29, 2019
   They won't pay you near what you're worth . They pay you under the
   table and still try to get over. The owner tried to underpay me on
   purpose. There not worth working for.

   good tips especially during football season.

   Productive and good coworkers.
   Salad Prep (Former Employee) –  Clovis, NM – November 9, 2018
   I would recommend this job to anyone in high school trying to get some
   income. It is a job that will put gas in your tank and food on the
   table. It is a great workplace.

   Cashier/Customer Service (Former Employee) –  Locust Grove, GA –
   September 30, 2018
   This was my first job, and I do not recommend this job at all. This
   place was unorganized and the owner is awful. They claimed they fired
   me to the police, when I really quit.

   Good place to work
   Waiter/Bartender (Former Employee) –  Caguas, PR – December 11, 2017
   It's a family environment and good place for events such as birthdays,
   anniversaries and any kind of celebration. At night a lot of people go
   to drink and they tip really well. I learned to work under pressure
   with the big parties and when it was happy hour time. The hardest part
   of the job is to serve multiple customers and charge them. I learned
   how to use the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job was to
   engage customers and make them feel comfortable in the restaurant.
   Pros
   Employee discount
   Cons
   During the day there is not as much visitors as at night time

   Fun but too much drama
   Waitress/Cashier (Former Employee) –  Lone Oak, TX – August 9, 2017
   I cannot handle the drama and could not deal with the owners sisters.
   Food is always good although the banana pudding is not homemade as well
   as the peach cobbler.
   Staff is friendly yet its a job for them till they find something else
   better.
