Pornhub Is "Extremely Interested" In Acquiring Tumblr

   Pornhub confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it is interested in acquiring
   Tumblr after news broke that Verizon is looking to sell the blogging
   platform.

   Pornhub Vice President Corey Price said in an email to BuzzFeed News
   that the porn-streaming giant is extremely interested in buying Tumblr,
   the once uniquely horny hub for young women and queer people that
   banned adult content last December to the disappointment of many of its
   users.

   Price said that restoring Tumblr's NSFW edge would be central to their
   acquisition of it, were it to actually happen.

   Tumblr owner Verizon is reportedly currently seeking a buyer for the
   blogging platform, which according to the Wall Street Journal has
   struggled to meet revenue targets.

   "Tumblr was a safe haven for those who wanted to explore and express
   their sexuality, adult entertainment aficionados included," Price told
   BuzzFeed News. "We’ve long been dismayed that such measures were taken
   to eradicate erotic communities on the platform, leaving many
   individuals without an asylum through which they could comfortably
   peruse adult content."

   BuzzFeed News has reached out to Verizon Media for comment.

   Tumblr's ownership history has been rocky to say the least in the last
   few years. First, it was purchased by Yahoo for $1.1 billion in 2013.
   By 2016, its value had been written down by $230 million. Then Tumblr
   ended up at Oath, the former name for Verizon Media Group, after
   Verizon bought Yahoo in 2017.

   Tumblr's life at Verizon has been difficult.

   In December, Tumblr announced that it would be banning pornography.
   NSFW content had long been one of the cornerstones of Tumblr's
   community and the news of a new SFW platform inspired threats of a mass
   user exodus. Before the ban, Tumblr was often regarded as one of the
   best places for independently created and curated pornographic content
   for young women and members of the queer and LGBT communities.

   Tumblr was also heavily criticized for a poorly implemented
   anti-pornography ban. The AI began flagging non-pornographic content,
   which ironically probably helped increase user engagement because
   everyone started making memes about it.

   Jokes about Pornhub buying Tumblr have been circulating since the porn
   ban, after the platform tweeted about embracing Tumblr's pornographic
   refugees.

   "There are obvious synergies between the two brands and value Pornhub
   could derive from Tumblr. We’re extremely interested in acquiring the
   platform and are very much looking forward to one day restoring it to
   its former glory with NSFW content," Price said.

Being An Instagram Influencer Is Hard Work, So This Guy Made A Bot To Do It
For Him

   A data engineer who created a 100% automated Instagram account to earn
   free meals at restaurants looking for promotion is offering his
   services to clients too.

   Dining out in New York is, well, expensive.

   Chris Buetti had a problem: Dining out in New York was getting too
   expensive. He saw was one obvious solution — becoming an Instagram
   influencer and asking restaurants to give him free meals to post about
   them — but that process would be time-consuming and require annoying
   soft skills like “being good at taking photos” and “creating content
   people enjoy.” Anyway, he already had a job.

   So Buetti, a data scientist by trade, decided to use his actual skills
   and automate the hard work of influencing by writing a program that
   recruited an audience of 25,000 (by autofollowing their accounts in
   hopes of getting a follow back), and reposted photographers’
   eye-catching photos of New York City for his growing entourage to
   engage with (“😍🤗🤗🤗great shot💕,” one person commented). Poof:
   @beautiful.newyorkcity was born — an active, popular, and 100%
   artificial Instagram account. For Buetti, it’s the perfect solution if
   you don’t want to actually dedicate time to curating an online
   following, but still want to score free spaghetti from restaurants
   seeking publicity. His program even finds restaurant accounts in New
   York, and sends them direct messages offering to promote them to
   followers in exchange for a comped meal — and no, it does not disclose
   that @beautiful.newyorkcity is run by a robot.

   Behold the latest chapter in the dark art of social media influencing,
   which despite being widely plagued with bots and fake engagement,
   continues to attract real interest from marketers and businesses.
   Buetti’s account has (at least some) real followers, but the
   influencing itself is being handled by some code rather than an eager
   personality. It’s a lifestyle brand generated by something that’s not
   alive.

   Buetti isn’t stopping at @beautiful.newyorkcity either. He also
   cofounded Social Rise Consulting, which uses similar tactics to grow
   clients’ followings online (for now, that’s namely mass following
   accounts to get follow backs). So far, Social Rise has 42 clients,
   according to its website. It’s all part of Buetti’s portfolio of
   automation-related work; he considers the free food hustle a showcase
   for his talents as a data scientist, which he detailed in a Medium
   post. Buetti told BuzzFeed News so far @beautiful.newyorkcity has
   earned him about 10 free or discounted meals at some pretty nice
   restaurants.

   Does his scheme foreshadow a future in which influencing is automated?
   Buetti says there’s no reason influencing has to be personality driven
   — there’s another kind involving impersonal aggregators. “@FuckJerry is
   where I got the idea,” he said, referencing the controversial meme
   kingpin. “He never needs to show his face, he just posts memes he finds
   on the internet; mostly he just steals them.” He saw this as the
   perfect use case for automated posting: “I was thinking, this guy never
   needs to touch [by hand] his account ever.”

   A post showing food from one of the restaurants that gave Buetti a free
   or discounted meal.

   But is it ethical for a man to get a free lunch based on a following
   his bot generated using a bunch of photos reposted without
   photographers’ permission? “None of the content my account posts is
   owned by me,” he wrote on Medium, but his program automatically credits
   photographers’ handles when it reposts their images (one of the
   photographers BuzzFeed News reached out to, Christina Danza, aka
   @downtownnative, didn’t mind that her work was reposted by AI).

   In the end, Buetti argues, a post from an automated account is worth as
   much to an advertiser as an endorsement from an account run by, you
   know, a human. He said several restaurants have followed up, saying
   customers came in after seeing their food posted on
   @beautiful.newyorkcity (the sponsored posts are labeled as ads). “I
   spent a lot of time and effort writing this script and I’m offering
   them a service and they’re offering me a free meal,” Buetti said.

   BuzzFeed News contacted one restaurant owner who gave
   @beautiful.newyorkcity a $25 dining credit in exchange for a post, and
   described how Buetti’s automated account works. “I guess in the end we
   were satisfied because it’s still an ad posted and showing us to their
   followers,” said the owner, who nonetheless asked to remain anonymous
   to prevent other would-be influencers from trying to dine for free.

   Advertisers may not mind, but human influencers are wary of automating
   their profession. “To be honest, seeing someone create such a large
   following through automation and AI is pretty discouraging for me, and
   for anyone else who has put blood, sweat, and tears into building their
   online brands,” Skyler Bouchard (@diningwithskyler), a New York
   City–based food Instagrammer with 175,000 followers, told BuzzFeed
   News. “But it’s also kind of fascinating.”

   A typical post on the account of scenic Manhattan. The photo was
   originally taken and posted by @downtownnative.

   Last year, influencer marketing company Mediakix ran a stunt in which
   it created a fake travel influencer — @wanderinggirl — using stock
   images, and bought fake followers. To test how vulnerable businesses
   were, it then reached out to hotels and restaurants asking for freebies
   (Mediakix declined all offers in the end). Evan Asano, founder and CEO
   of Mediakix, called Buetti’s approach “pretty sophisticated and not
   something that can be easily replicated by the masses” compared to
   simply buying followers. But he warned, “most of Instagram is
   influencer and personality-driven, and this type of posting can't ever
   replace the draw of personalities.”

   Skyler Bouchard agrees. “Being human still has the most power when it
   comes to influencing others, and nothing beats that.”

   Instagram may not allow Buetti and his cohorts to mooch off
   @beautiful.newyorkcity without putting in at least some effort for long
   (Buetti gave the log-in to a friend, and said he has moved on to other
   accounts). A representative for Instagram told BuzzFeed News certain
   kinds of automation, in particular sending DMs, are in violation of the
   terms of service.

   Buetti told BuzzFeed News he’s given up the free meal racket for now —
   it just wasn’t worth his time and effort to schlep across Manhattan
   neighborhoods just for a free dinner. “I’d rather do something where I
   can see the dollars in my bank account going up,” he said. He’s also
   considering an attempt at traditional food influencing, with real
   photos of himself.

A Mom Found Almost A Dozen YouTube Kids Videos Showing Suicide, School
Shootings, And Abuse

   In a statement to BuzzFeed News, YouTube said it is “making constant
   improvements to [its] systems and recognize there’s more work to do.”

   Dr. Free Hess, a mother and pediatrician from Gainesville, Florida,
   recently discovered and reported a trove of content on the YouTube Kids
   app depicting suicides, school shootings, and violence against female
   characters.
   The near-dozen videos Hess flagged have since been deleted, but she
   told BuzzFeed News she fears there are many more videos still on the
   platform that kids are being exposed to.
   “I found about 10 [videos] very quickly and very easily, but stopped
   there simply because I wanted to get the blog post out, not because
   there weren’t more,” she said. Hess screen-recorded and shared the
   cartoons she did find on her blog PediMom.com on Friday.
   Among the videos she discovered is a cartoon inspired by Minecraft’s
   graphics called “Monster School: SLENDERMAN HORROR GAME.” In the game,
   a character finds their victim in school, behind a desk, and shoots
   them. The shooter is seen laughing after.
   The animated series is hosted on an account called TellBite, which has
   over 167,000 subscribers on its main YouTube channel. Its videos rack
   up thousands of views.
   (Note: This account, and others, are created first on YouTube, which
   only allows users ages 13 and older to post. The YouTube Kids app
   claims to take content on YouTube and curate the videos to find those
   that are kid-friendly, “to make it safer and simpler for kids to
   explore the world through online video.”)

   In another clip first posted to YouTube and created by the account
   Toasty Qween, a young female character is seen attempting to kill
   herself with a knife before her dad, whose death is shown earlier,
   intervenes.

   “Ending my pain,” her speech bubble says in the clip. The entire video
   is set to the song “Don’t You Worry Child.”
   The original video on YouTube currently has over 1 million views.
   Suicide ideation and attempts are seen in other animated videos found
   on YouTube Kids, like one titled “Doki! Doki! Rainclouds New End!!!” In
   this one, a character narrates an attempted suicide. “Why won’t the
   world let me die?” the character says.
   In the clip, a second character is introduced and described as someone
   who arrived at the suicide scene “just in time” to attempt to talk the
   main character down.
   “Why couldn’t he just let me hang myself?” they respond to the second
   character’s appearance.

   Hess said she’s found several other cartoons on the app that may not
   have originally been intended for kids, but depict toxic and dangerous
   relationship dynamics.

   In fact, during her correspondence with BuzzFeed News, she found
   another cartoon on the app called “Smoke in Mirrors” by the user Rika
   Xox. In this video, a character “just stabbed a girl in the chair,” she
   said, while providing screenshots of the scene.
   Like the other aforementioned videos, she promptly reported it, and is
   awaiting YouTube to take action and to take it down.
   In a statement to BuzzFeed News, YouTube insists it “take[s] feedback
   very seriously,” and that it is working to “ensure the videos in
   YouTube Kids are family-friendly.”
   “We appreciate people drawing problematic content to our attention, and
   make it possible for anyone to flag a video. Flagged videos are
   manually reviewed 24/7 and any videos that don’t belong in the app are
   removed,” a spokesperson said.
   The company added that while it is “making constant improvements to our
   systems,” it admits that “there’s more work to do.”
   Free Hess / Via Rika Xox / YouTube

   Last week, YouTube confirmed it removed a video of a popular children’s
   Splatoon-style cartoon. The removal was prompted when parents
   discovered a troll had reuploaded the cartoon with a spliced-in clip of
   a former YouTube personality encouraging children to cut themselves.
   Hess and other parents had aggressively reported that user and cartoon
   before it was finally removed. She does not believe YouTube is taking
   the matter seriously enough or doing enough to censor content before
   children are able to access it.

   “I would like them to recognize the dangers associated with this for
   our children [and] to be taking parents’ concerns seriously,” she said.

   The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. Other
   international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org.

Two Muslim Men Said Their American Airlines Flight Was Canceled After They

   Abderraoof Alkhawaldeh speaks at a press conference.

   Two Muslim men who were boarding a plane from Birmingham, Alabama, to
   Dallas on Saturday have filed a complaint with the US Department of
   Transportation over what they said was blatant racial profiling by the
   flight crew.

   Abderraoof Alkhawaldeh and Issam Abdallah, two Muslim community leaders
   from the Dallas area, said their flight was canceled because the crew
   “did not feel comfortable” with them on the plane.

   Everything had been going smoothly when they boarded the flight. The
   men, who are friends but were traveling separately, spotted each other
   and waved.

   While waiting for the crew to sort out some maintenance issues before
   takeoff, Abdallah got up from his seat to use the restroom. When he
   came out, he realized a flight attendant was standing close to the
   bathroom door, the Dallas Morning News reported.

   “The flight attendant reported that he went to the restroom and flushed
   the toilet twice,” Alkhawaldeh told CBS DFW. “The last time I know,
   flushing is allowed in this country.”

   When Alkhawaldeh and Abdallah got off the plane, they said they were
   interrogated by law enforcement officers who followed them and had
   their bags screened by TSA again.

   An American Airlines spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the flight
   was operated and staffed by a regional carrier, Mesa Airlines.

   The airline said in a statement that the flight was canceled “due to
   concerns raised by a crew member and a passenger” and that its team was
   reviewing the incident with Mesa Airlines.

   “We have reached out to Mr. Alkhawaldeh and Mr. Abdallah to better
   understand their experience,” the statement said.

   A Mesa Airlines spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the company is
   “conducting a thorough investigation of this matter.”

   The two men addressed the incident at a press conference at the Council
   on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) DFW chapter Thursday. “I felt like
   I am discriminated against my ethnicity, my religion,” Abdallah told
   reporters. “It was the most horrible, humiliating day of my life.”

How Did Lauren Duca’s Revolution Backfire?

   The viral writer wants to galvanize young people with her new book, How
   to Start a Revolution. But past controversies — and a new complaint
   filed by her New York University students — threaten to undermine her
   message.

   You can’t really blame journalist and activist Lauren Duca for being a
   little nervous about agreeing to an interview. When I first asked to
   profile her in advance of her new book, How to Start a Revolution:
   Young People and the Future of American Politics, I did it over Twitter
   DM. She agreed, but seemed to get anxious as we got closer to settling
   on a meeting time. “Hold on lol,” she wrote. “Are you not following me?
   Feels like that would be helpful for a profile. And, not gonna lie,
   that makes me a bit apprehensive!”

   When we eventually met in person in mid-August, she clarified the
   source of her anxiety a bit more. “I assumed it meant you were one of
   my haters,” she said. “There’s a level of reasonable paranoia. It’s
   weird being public-facing. It’s weird to interact with an idea of you.”

   In her short professional life, Duca has been held up as both a
   feminist icon of her generation and a phony quasi-journalist who has
   taken advantage of a few lucky moments in her life. The truth, it
   seems, just depends on what version of herself she allows you to see.
   Over the past few years, Duca has become one of the most recognizable
   faces among a specific type of progressive white feminist,
   pussyhat-wearing activist-journalist — less a singular person than a
   representative of a particular corner of the #resistance. After working
   as a Teen Vogue columnist, a Twitter personality, a television talking
   head, and, most recently, an author writing about democracy and
   citizenship, the highs and lows of the viral economy seem to be taking
   their toll on her.

   In all likelihood, you first heard of Duca as the young woman who
   called Tucker Carlson “a sexist pig” during a 2016 Fox News appearance.
   In the 10-minute segment on his show, Duca debated Carlson on whether
   people should feel free to yell at Ivanka Trump when they see her on a
   commercial flight. Carlson, who appeared to be loudly melting down
   during the segment, eventually snapped at Duca, “You should stick to
   the thigh-high boots. You’re better at that.”
   Carlson ended the segment immediately after he insulted her, but Duca
   still got the final word anyway. As her satellite feed window began to
   shrink away and her microphone faded out, she mouthed the words “You’re
   a sexist pig” so clearly that it’s as if they’re blaring through in
   surround sound. It was (and is)...high art.

   December 2016 was a big month for Duca — a few weeks before her Carlson
   appearance, she had written a column for Teen Vogue that seemed to
   encapsulate how a lot of liberals and progressives were feeling about
   the then-new president: “Donald Trump Is Gaslighting America.”

   In it, Duca writes about how frequently Trump makes US citizens
   question basic facts like whether undocumented immigrants are allowed
   to vote, the national unemployment rate, and the integrity of various
   journalistic outlets. The piece went viral — shared by Dan Rather and
   Bette Midler, among others — because in the midst of all the
   postelection hand-wringing, Duca’s piece put in clear terms why people
   on the left were feeling so hopeless. (According to a spokesperson for
   Teen Vogue, the piece has received more than 1 million unique views.)

   Duca, just 25 years old at the time, became a media darling seemingly
   overnight. Her rise coincided with Teen Vogue’s own political awakening
   as a leader in the anti-Trump resistance. Suddenly the country realized
   that Teen Vogue wasn’t just focused on makeup and fashion; it was
   giving young people a place to read about social justice, politics,
   inequality, and the power of activism.
   “It’s weird being public-facing. It’s weird to interact with an idea of
   you.”

   In the months after her gaslighting piece and Fox News appearance, the
   media couldn’t get enough of Duca. She was profiled by the New York
   Times, gave commencement speeches, appeared on countless television
   shows, won awards for excellence in journalism, was profiled by the
   Today show, continued writing for Teen Vogue until 2018, and has since
   amassed nearly half a million Twitter followers.

   But in the last year or so, Duca has tempered her online persona: Her
   tweets are less frenetic and frequent. “I don’t know if it’s necessary
   to be constantly in the mix,” she told me. “There are other people who
   got this too. That’s your ego, that you feel like you need to be
   [there]. No. Relax.”

   Now 28 years old, Duca seems primed to stand alongside other young,
   emerging feminist media icons like Jessica Valenti or Lindy West or Liz
   Plank, but, as is the case with anyone who reaches a certain level of
   online fame, she’s had her share of detractors. That isn’t to say Duca
   doesn’t have her fans — she is loved because she’s feisty and bold and
   funny, especially in the face of ruthless sexism, always ready with a
   quip on Twitter. And yet she’s been criticized for not practicing what
   she preaches, behaving like she’s above reproach, and for having the
   capacity to be quite cruel.

   Whatever the general public might think of Duca’s personal politics,
   her book, How to Start a Revolution, is set to be published on Sept.
   24. The 178-page manifesto has the lofty goal of laying “the groundwork
   for a re-democratizing moment as it might be built out of the untapped
   potential of young people,” according to the book jacket. It’s been
   blurbed by heavy hitters, including Rather, Janet Mock, and Ariel Levy,
   the latter calling Duca “the millennial feminist warrior queen of
   social media.”

   Duca also spent this past summer teaching “The Feminist Journalist,” a
   six-week New York University journalism course for both high school and
   college students. After Duca agreed to our interview, she also
   acquiesced to letting me sit in on the final day of the class. She
   asked her students to come prepared with questions for her for what
   would be an AMA-style session in Washington Square Park. Her students
   sat in a circle around her in the wet grass. It was, I imagine, exactly
   what Tucker Carlson would envision a liberal journalism class might be:
   a bunch of kids from varied backgrounds, ethnicities, orientations, and
   gender identities, who could each afford a $6,500 class, wearing
   T-shirts that said “GenderQueer” or “Kill Patriarchy.”

   In the park, Duca praised her students for their ideas and pitches:
   “You so totally learned what I was trying to teach you.” Nearly four
   weeks after the course ended, however, her students sent a collective
   formal complaint to the heads of the NYU journalism school about Duca’s
   conduct. “We are disappointed at the department and NYU for hiring a
   professor with more interest in promoting her book than teaching a
   group of students eager to learn,” they wrote. In the days after the
   course ended, several of the students also reached out to me to share
   more of their concerns. “Her ability to exploit the movement is really
   frustrating,” one former student said.

   Caught between her and her unhappy students, I was now situated
   uncomfortably between the two sides of Lauren Duca: the brand and the
   reality.

   Three days before I joined Duca in her class, I met her for the first
   time at a coffee shop in Brooklyn. Wearing a tattered David Bowie
   T-shirt and a big silver fish earring in her right ear, she greeted me
   with outstretched arms and a big grin. Though it took me weeks to get
   her to agree to an interview, she’s charming in person, funny, and
   self-deprecating: “We’ve all evolved since we were 18,” she told me
   after she flashed her “So it goes” rib cage tattoo at me.

   She was open to talking about at least some of the controversies that
   have surrounded her. When her Teen Vogue gaslighting piece came out,
   some people argued that she had ripped off a HuffPost piece from
   earlier that year. (Tyler Kingkade is a former BuzzFeed News employee.)
   Duca didn’t mention the article in our interview specifically, but she
   has admitted that she doesn’t think she reinvented the wheel.
   “It’s not that I’ve come up with some really crazy idea. It’s that I’ve
   nailed a moment in the culture, expressed something that people feel
   and haven’t been able to precisely express,” she told me. “I’m
   bolstering their foundation of information so they feel the confidence
   upon which to act.” Duca also understands that part of going viral on
   the internet is hitting at the right time in the right way. And who can
   blame her for capitalizing on such good luck?

   “My power,” Duca told me, “is as a great communicator.”

   At Teen Vogue, Duca was brought on to work the weekend shifts by
   Phillip Picardi, then the magazine’s online editor. “She demonstrated a
   range of coverage: She could write things from a perspective that would
   bring in a social or cultural commentary that I felt was important to
   add to Teen Vogue,” he told me. “It also helped that I found her, and
   still do find her, extremely funny.”
   “My power,” Duca told me, “is as a great communicator.”

   Together, Picardi and Duca had big plans to make TeenVogue.com more
   than just a fashion and lifestyle site by bringing politics to the
   forefront of its coverage. Teen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Elaine Welteroth
   was doing something similar at the time for the print side. This was in
   the — comparatively — halcyon days of 2016 and 2017, when people on the
   left were still struggling to figure out what to do. Seemingly every
   weekend there was a march — the Women’s March, A Day Without
   Immigrants, A Day Without Women — even the Juggalos came out for their
   own.

   Both the right and left were fostering their own young, white,
   conventionally attractive representatives of their respective
   movements. While Duca was winning acclaim on the left, women like Tomi
   Lahren and Laura Loomer were also going viral for their videos railing
   against immigration and Black Lives Matter. Though their messages
   weren’t necessarily new, their youth and social media savvy made them
   appealing representatives for the right.

   Duca’s piece wasn’t the only or the best example of Teen Vogue’s foray
   into politics, but it did hit the hardest. “The gaslighting piece was
   able to sum up a lot,” Picardi said. “It created a consciousness around
   misinformation and abuse of power that I think was extremely sharp and
   really cut through the noise. Obviously the numbers and Lauren’s
   trajectory speaks to its impact wholeheartedly.”

   Picardi picks up on what may be Duca’s greatest asset: taking
   complicated political issues and making them approachable to a much
   younger audience who might otherwise feel boxed out of these
   conversations. No wonder she seems to shock reporters who’ve cut their
   teeth treating politics like sacred ground that only the deserving can
   enter. “There’s not a lot of showmanship with her writing or with her
   approach,” Picardi said. “I think that makes more people feel like they
   can be invited to the conversation.”
   Fox News

   There’s not a tremendous amount of coverage about Duca’s new book just
   yet, but what is public is largely positive. At time of this
   publication, it has a 4.40 rating on Goodreads (but with just 10
   ratings thus far a week before its release), and one glowing Publishers
   Weekly review. “Duca’s conversational prose ... and clear passion for
   equality allows her to galvanize without preaching,” reads the review.
   “This call to action will resonate even with those who are not already
   involved in progressive politics.”

   Duca’s book certainly speaks to its readers in very simple terms — it
   defines “democracy” and “oligarchy” and “gaslighting,” terms that you
   might be familiar with if you’ve ever taken a civics class or two. But
   for Duca’s audience, whom she considers to be between 14 and 24, it’s a
   perfectly reasonable and non-condescending education; how else are you
   going to get young people to care about politics if you don’t explain
   it to them? “I think a lot of political writing is written from this
   high-perch, omniscient view that it's just not accessible, and it’s
   disempowering at times,” Duca told me. “I think I tend to forget how
   much I have the IV plugged in and how high my knowledge level is.”

   But here’s the thing: Some of our most prominent activists today are
   teenagers or twentysomethings. Nineteen-year-old David Hogg and his
   sibling, 16-year-old Lauren Hogg (both of whom Duca interviews in How
   to Start a Revolution) are fighting for gun control more effectively
   than some members of Congress. Greta Thunberg, also just 16, is
   inspiring other teens to fight climate change. Nadya Okamoto is a
   21-year-old and the founder of a nonprofit that works toward ending
   period poverty.

   Malala Yousafzai, at 22, has a Nobel Peace Prize. Is Duca the best
   person suited to speak to Gen Z when Gen Z is already rallying its own
   peers?
   Simon & Schuster

   The book has some confusing factual errors, too. In one chapter, Duca
   uses the infamous 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese as a case study for the
   bystander effect, when in fact that specific myth around Genovese’s
   murder had long been debunked. (Though she uses this comparison, she
   also concedes on the next page that the events are disputed.) Finished
   copies of the first hardcover printing also come with this erratum
   slipped in: “On page 29, reporter David Folkenflik is incorrectly
   identified as a media consultant for the NRA. Mr. Folkenflik works at
   National Public Radio, where he is a media correspondent.” The cover
   itself — George Washington in pop art makeup — has also been readily
   mocked.

   Privilege comes up often when criticizing Duca, and her book does her
   no favors on this front. Like the work of a lot of white women in
   political writing, the book only fleetingly examines the intersection
   of race when she talks about political engagement. “Before the 2016
   election, I only ever understood politics as a spectator sport,” she
   writes early in the book. “Once upon a time it was possible to say ‘I
   don’t like politics’ as if expressing a distaste for olives.” Which of
   course makes you ask: Who exactly has been so lucky to spend their
   entire pre-2016 life thinking this?

   The real purpose of the book — as stated by Duca in our interview — is
   to help galvanize young people to get involved in politics and help
   them be informed. “Well, friends, being a good citizen is as easy as
   three simple steps,” she writes in the conclusion. Her steps include
   “learn — empower yourself with information,” “decide — form a political
   opinion,” and “act — put your beliefs into action.” It’s simple, but
   sometimes simple is enough. Simple can make you go viral with a message
   that’s far more helpful than just sitting around and waiting for
   someone to leave office. “I think that journalism is necessarily an
   activist practice,” she told me. “I think the function of journalism
   should be to empower people with information, and the information
   people need to act and raise their voices.”
   “This moment is not about suddenly caring. It’s about finally doing,”
   she writes in How to Start a Revolution. But by the end of the book it
   remains unclear what, exactly, she’s encouraging us to do.

   How to Start a Revolution also attempts to contend with Duca’s
   virality. Her online fame has given her a massive platform, but it has
   come at a cost. “The things that she showed me that people said to her,
   I have never experienced that level of ire in my life,” Picardi said.
   “Rape threats on the regular that she was reporting to Twitter multiple
   times per day, death threats, horrible things that were said about her
   appearance or her body.”

   There’s another reason Duca went viral: “Pharma bro” Martin Shkreli’s
   consistent Twitter harassment of her in 2017. He even went as far as
   bizarrely photoshopping himself into a photo of Duca and her
   then-husband. (He also invited her to the presidential inauguration as
   his date, lucky girl.) The harassment got him suspended, which, of
   course, begot more internet harassment for Duca.

   Even now, Duca continues to experience a grotesque amount of
   harassment. “It was super bad after Tucker. I got really sick. I had a
   panic attack and could not move for a couple of days,” Duca said. “That
   was one of the most pivotal moments of my life because I was like, what
   am I doing? What is all of this for? What am I enduring? I had to
   figure out what I care about and what hills I'm going to die on. I was
   processing that it does take a toll. I can't just pretend it doesn't.”

   While some criticisms directed against Duca are valid, other ones are,
   to put it lightly, completely unhinged. While the right attacks her
   with outright inhumanity, some on the left questions her sincerity in
   the movements she writes about and engages in, and wonder whether she
   deserves whatever success she’s had. Plenty of the criticisms,
   according to Duca, are just bad-faith arguments. “An example is Pride
   of 2017: I ate pussy for the first time the night before, and I tweeted
   the next day, ‘Happy Pride to everyone because no one’s 100% straight.’
   I was just, like, pumped. People, women, predominantly in New York
   media, framed it as if I was All Lives Mattering Pride.” Duca later
   deleted the tweet after she received backlash.
   "I ate pussy for the first time the night before, and I tweeted the
   next day, ‘Happy Pride to everyone, because no one’s 100%
   straight.’ People framed it as if I was All Lives Mattering Pride."

   “Their idea is that I’m espousing equality for personal gain, and
   that’s what they’re attacking. They're using the language of equality
   to attack me,” Duca says. “[Do] they think someone who’s out here
   putting their literal life on the line — death and rape threats, the
   word ‘literal’ does apply here — to stand up for equality and blaze a
   trail for young women is doing that to get famous and to — I don't know
   — barely be able to have health insurance and a home and write a book?”

   Older tweets have also resurfaced, ones where she mocked fat people and
   community college attendees. These, at least, Duca will acknowledge and
   apologize for. “That’s something I really had to evolve from. I thought
   I was fucking fat when I wrote that. I was bulimic when I wrote that. I
   was miserable when I wrote that and I was socialized to think that fat
   jokes were okay,” she said. “I don’t defend that shit at all. I
   apologize. Those were horrible. I appreciate that someone would feel
   skeptical, and I think if their heart is in the right place, they would
   also be able to hear me say I’m sorry and understand that it was a
   different time, 2012, in terms of what we understood as politically
   correct, and we’ve all had to evolve.”

   Duca’s nascent career is filled with missteps, ones that in isolation
   aren’t really a huge deal for your average millennial, but certainly
   have larger consequences when you’re a representative for a larger
   movement advocating for better political (and personal) behavior.

   And then there are the rumors about Duca’s time at HuffPost, when she
   would have been around 24, allegations which are practically media lore
   at this point. (Screenshots of her alleged harassment have circulated
   among media types for years.) In March, Jezebel wrote the first
   published report about it. Writer Anna Merlan reported that 10 of
   Duca’s former colleagues anonymously alleged that she “sent several
   inappropriate emails to and about her coworkers — and herself — from
   what was meant to be an anonymous account.” She allegedly referred to
   one male writer as a “bald freak.” Another writer was allegedly called
   an “overweight fake blonde.” Duca herself was allegedly referred to as
   a “feminazi.”

   Duca’s argument, at the time, was that someone was faking an email
   account pretending to be her and sending her colleagues harassing mail.
   In our interview, she claimed that she never read the Jezebel piece and
   declined to comment on her time at HuffPost or allegations that she
   sent her colleagues harassing emails. (She didn’t reply to Jezebel when
   they requested comment either.)

   “Several of Duca’s former coworkers have come to see her newfound
   stardom as a referendum on the nature of viral fame itself,” Merlan
   wrote in her Jezebel piece, “as well as how someone aligning themselves
   with the movements du jour — mainstream, marketable feminism; the more
   salient parts of the Resistance — can escape any real scrutiny.”
   “My gut motivating ideology is pushing for equality, is pushing for
   public power. What that looks like will change over time.”

   While Duca is willing to apologize for some of her past behavior, she’s
   dismissive of a lot of the other criticism. “I think jealousy doesn't
   always look like what you think it looks like, and I think it's funny
   that it's directed at me in a way it's not directed at my male
   counterparts. I wonder if they find it as excruciatingly obvious as I
   do,” she said. “My gut motivating ideology is pushing for equality, is
   pushing for public power. What that looks like will change over time.
   Maybe I'll have some tweets that are offensive to robots in a few
   years. We'll see. Someone from, like, Jacobin will screenshot them, and
   the whole thing will happen again,” she said, laughing and shrugging
   slightly.

   For Merlan, and a significant contingency of Progressive Twitter, these
   apologies seem to largely fall flat, especially considering her
   evasiveness about her time at HuffPost. “I really thought that there
   was a possibility that we could have a genuine conversation about how
   she reconciled this incident in her life with who she is now,” Merlan
   told me. “But that didn’t turn out to be the case.”

   Lauren Duca accepts an award onstage at the the 9th Annual Shorty
   Awards on April 23, 2017, in New York City.

   Duca was hesitant to allow me to join her for her last day of her NYU
   class, and I understood why. After her syllabus started circulating on
   Twitter, so did the endless mockery. The syllabus seemed to focus
   heavily on personal branding (students would have to tweet for 20% of
   their grade) and ironically included Jon Ronson’s So You’ve Been
   Publicly Shamed as required reading. Plus, she spelled Rashomon wrong,
   which upset just about everyone.

   “I think that they’re fucking corny. They’re making fun of me — for
   putting Twitter on my syllabus — on Twitter, which is the only place
   they have a voice,” Duca said. “I wish the people who spent a ton of
   time criticizing me would use that energy to make a thing. To have an
   idea.”

   How did Lauren Duca get away with teaching a feminist journalism class
   without having any feminist text, let alone black feminist text, on her
   syllabus....?!? I’m lost.

   A few days after I sat in on Duca’s class, I received a number of
   emails, unprompted, from her former students who wanted to talk about
   their six weeks in her class. “It was an interesting experience to say
   the least,” one student wrote.

   Out of 10 students, five spoke to me on the record, under the condition
   of anonymity, specifically due to fear of reprisals from Duca or any of
   her professional connections. All of them had similar allegations
   against Duca and the class’s structure: that Duca didn’t follow her own
   syllabus, that she spoke often and inappropriately about her personal
   life, that she would belittle and yell at students, and, most
   pressingly, that she targeted one student in particular. All the
   students wrote a formal letter of complaint to NYU and signed it,
   “Sincerely, ‘The Feminist Journalist’ Class - Summer 2019.” When I
   reached out to Duca for her comment on the complaint, she started by
   saying, “I guess I'm not a teacher.”

   The complaint, filed to NYU journalism school’s institute director, Ted
   Conover, and associate director, Meredith Broussard, on Sept. 11,
   details many of the same things the five students told me. “There was a
   consistent lack of professionalism that persisted throughout every
   aspect of the course,” the complaint reads. “We are disappointed at the
   department and NYU as an institution for hiring a professor without a
   syllabus and classroom management skills. We are disappointed at the
   department and NYU for hiring a professor without a clear course
   objective.”
   “I wish the people who spent a ton of time criticizing me would use
   that energy to make a thing. To have an idea.”

   Most of the students had never taken any sort of structured journalism
   class before, and their ages ranged from high school students to
   college students in their mid-twenties, some of whom had a few
   internships under their belts. “There was no syllabus or clear
   expectations of what she would be teaching us. The class kind of banded
   together to teach each other things so that we weren’t the subject of
   Lauren’s wrath,” said one student. “I was expecting to learn how to
   write an article.”

   “I created a dynamic, experimental, ever-evolving course structure that
   pulled from my syllabus, added things in based on our conversation and
   allowed each of them to individually craft their pieces, and I watched
   the pieces evolve over the course of the semester,” Duca said in
   response. “I think that they, on some level, internalized some of the
   objectives, whether they know that explicitly or not.”

   All five students alleged that Duca’s class was disorganized and “a
   master class in Lauren Duca’s personal life.” (“The point of it is that
   I'm oversharing all the time. And I think that, yeah, some people like
   it, some people don't. Apparently you fucking hate it, but that's
   fine,” Duca told me.) They said that she would vanish for 30 to 45
   minutes per class to “meditate.” (“It was a three-hour class and we
   took a break and I would meditate for 15 minutes and they would be gone
   getting snacks and stuff,” Duca responded.) And that the class was a
   “waste of six weeks for all of us, and we don’t want anyone else to
   make this mistake again.” They claim Duca would snap at them for small
   problems, accuse them of not having done the readings, and never
   actually read any of the assignments they submitted to her.

   Duca responded that she did read all the assignments, though she added:
   “It's okay if I'm not a great teacher because I'm great at lots of
   other things.”

   But most galling is that all the students — both in interviews and in
   the formal complaint to the college — claim that Duca went out of her
   way to target one student in particular: an exchange student who was
   visiting New York for school. “Her English wasn’t perfect but that’s
   hard,” one student told me. “She came from another country. She was
   very courageous for taking this class.”

   The students claimed that Duca would unfairly admonish this particular
   individual in class. “We all clocked it two or three classes in,” said
   a classmate. They claimed that Duca said the student “won’t have a lot
   to say” during class presentations, that she refused to accept
   assignments from this student while accepting them from others, that
   she called her work “basic” and “vague,” and that during one class Duca
   made the student cry during a one-on-one meeting. To this Duca
   responded, “I said, ‘You need to do the work’; she cried. Like, come
   on. Is that targeting? What am I supposed to do? ‘You didn't do the
   work; here's a trophy’?”

   “That day was the day that I decided that there’s no way we’re going to
   let this person teach students again. It was awful. It was absolutely
   awful,” one of the students told me. “She definitely picked favorites,
   and she picked people she blatantly didn’t like,” said another. (In the
   complaint the students wrote to NYU, it says that Duca “consistently
   targeted this student on the basis of a communication difficulty the
   student cannot change.”)

   “We received a complaint pertaining to Ms. Duca’s course only yesterday
   and are carefully assessing it,” Conover told me in an email statement
   on Sept. 12. “After our review, we will determine the course of action
   that is in the best interests of our students and their education.”
   Since receiving the complaint, Conover has already reached out to one
   student to meet in person and discuss the complaint in more detail.

   As I continued asking Duca for comment about the specifics of the
   complaint, she became more and more agitated. “You should put in there
   that my tone was expressly pissed off and frustrated,” Duca told me.
   “You're being so fucking hard on me, Scaachi, and I really, really,
   really, really would ask you if you would be grilling a man in this
   same way. It's amazing. The shit that I have endured to continue to
   sustain a voice where I'm just fighting every inch for the same thing
   that I think that you want, which is public power and equality, and I'm
   trying my goddamn best, okay?”
   “In a way,” one student told me, “she is that ‘worst idea’ that
   conservatives think liberals are.”

   The line went silent and I asked Duca if she was still there. She was,
   and she continued questioning me about my motives around this article
   before saying, “Congratulations, you thrillingly, thrillingly adept
   journalist, you have discovered that Lauren Duca is not perfect. Put it
   in the headline, baby.”

   Some of the students knew who Duca was before they took the class — “It
   was exciting … to be up close with somebody who’s Twitter famous and
   hear what her writing process is like given the fact that now she’s who
   she is,” one student said — but most of them left the class largely
   disillusioned with Duca, if not with journalism entirely. “It’s
   frustrating to see as a student, as a young woman, see how somebody can
   so clearly take advantage of the system and capitalize on her supposed
   wokeness while not practicing what she’s writing about,” one of the
   former students said.

   But Duca didn’t become a representative of the millennial resistance
   entirely on her own. It happened almost accidentally: a simple but
   apropos piece that went viral from a publication not otherwise expected
   to deliver such a message; a television appearance where she was
   condescended to and got heaps of people coming to her defense as a
   result; and a harasser who zeroed in on her, garnering her even more
   empathy. And because Twitter fame is mercurial, her milkshake-ducking
   was also inevitable. No one can possibly live up to the expectation of
   perfect wokeness at all times. If you play the game too much, and in
   some ways too well, you risk alienating your followers because they no
   longer trust that your politics are anything more than performative.

   “In a way,” one student told me, “she is that ‘worst idea’ that
   conservatives think liberals are.”

   If Duca wanted to get young people to rally together in the pursuit of
   a cause, she was successful. It just managed to be against her rather
   than some other common enemy. “Writing a book is not easy,” Merlan told
   me. “Living your life in public is not easy. But I do think we have a
   responsibility as people who live in public to own our mistakes and our
   misdeeds in public, and I wish she had done that.”

   “People’s memories are very short,” Merlan added. “She’ll absolutely be
   fine.”

   Duca is already on her way to writing a second book, this one about her
   “major, major god experience,” which she is tentatively titling Ego in
   Retreat. Since our first interview and my observation of her final NYU
   class, Duca has unfollowed me on Twitter. ●
