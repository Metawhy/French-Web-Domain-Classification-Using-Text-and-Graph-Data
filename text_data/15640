   ManageWP is a part of my morning routine. I just login and start
   updating different sites. I use it to manage over 100 sites. It's just
   a great tool that really saves me a huge amount of time everyday.
   — Mike Little

   In our opinion, ManageWP's best kept secret is their Client Reports
   feature. There is nothing more valuable than clear documentation to
   show our clients the work we’ve performed. The fact that reports are
   customizable and multilingual puts ManageWP leagues ahead of
   competitors.
   — Jean-Francois Arseneault, SatelliteWP

   With an incredibly rich feature set, a solid and dependable service, I
   recommend ManageWP to anyone who is taking WordPress Maintenance
   Management seriously.
   — Remkus de Vries, buro KREAS

   We tested out most, if not all the WP management software out there,
   and nothing compares to what ManageWP provides.
   — Jeremy Choi, WPUP

   ManageWP saves me dozens of hours each month (not to mention liberating
   me from the tedium of administering so many sites). ManageWP has never
   failed me. Not once.
   — Douglas McLennan, ArtsJournal

   Backups run flawlessly in the background without me having to lift a
   finger, and I get notified immediately if any of my sites are down.
   — Anita Henderson, i4design

   One particular feature that has helped us again and again is the
   ability to filter through all of our sites looking for a specific
   plugin. When we find out a certain plugin has a security vulnerability
   of some kind, we’re able to quickly find all of the affected client
   sites, and push out fixes right away.
   — Ryan D. Sullivan, WP Site Care

   We manage a lot of sites and when they go offline, we lose money. I
   love that ManageWP sends me a text notifying me if my website is no
   longer responsive. This way I see it quicker, can get it up sooner and
   less money is lost. ManageWP pays for itself.
   — David Aston, IncomeDiary
