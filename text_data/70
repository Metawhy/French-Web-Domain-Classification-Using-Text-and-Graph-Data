Privacy Policy

   WALKME GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY

   Effective Date: May 15, 2018
   TRUSTe


   WalkMe Ltd. and its affiliates (“WalkMe“, “we” or “us“) is committed to
   protecting the privacy of the users of its website at the
   address www.WalkMe.com or any other website managed and controlled by
   WalkMe (the “Site“) and its online products, including the WalkMe
   System^™ and WalkMe Mobile^™   (each a “Service” and collectively the

   This Policy explains the types of information we may collect from you
   or that you may provide when you visit the Site or use the Services and

   disclosing that information.

   Please note: this Privacy Policy details WalkMe’s practices for the
   Site and Services it offers separately. In order to have the full
   picture of our privacy practices, you need to read the relevant Section
   about the Services you are using together with the General Section.

   GENERAL (THIS SECTION APPLIES FOR ALL SERVICES)
   Please refer to the specific Section(s) about the Site or Services you
   use or plan to use for a complete review of the relevant practices.


   A.    CONSENT AND PRINCIPALS OF PROCESSING DATA

   WalkMe processes data fairly, lawfully, in a transparent manner and in
   accordance with individuals’ rights (as applicable). The use of
   information collected through our Services shall be limited to the
   purpose of providing the service for which our Client has engaged
   WalkMe or, if collected through the website or other marketing means,
   to WalkMe’s legitimate interests, where we have considered these are
   not overridden by your rights.

   WalkMe may process data of an End User on behalf of the Controller when
   the Controller obtains consent from an End User or when there is
   another basis for doing so under applicable law. For purposes of this
   Privacy Policy, a Controller may mean a Customer or anyone acting a
   Customer’s behalf or, Walkme (only in connection with information
   provided to it through the website or for marketing purposes). (the
   “Controller”), Customers who cause WalkMe to process Personal
   Information of an End User are obligated to hold all appropriate
   consents (if applicable) and may only utilize the Services pursuant to
   applicable law. If you are an End User of the Services, please contact
   the Controller for additional detail. We may transfer Personal
   Information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers
   to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with
   our Customers (the Controller). Furthermore, WalkMe supports End Users’
   rights to retrieve any information retained on our servers which
   relates to such End User. WalkMe acknowledges that you have the right
   to access your Personal Information. We have processes in place to
   accommodate an End User’s rights to delete data, amend erroneous data,
   access data and receive Personal Data or Sensitive Data in a machine
   readable commonly used format, all subject to reasonable technical
   restrains and abilities. For more information, please see the Section
   “Modification or Deletion of Data” under the applicable Site or Service
   Section.

   Personal Information or Personal Data is information by which an
   individual may be personally identified, including name, address,
   e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that is
   defined as Personal Information, Personal Data, or Personally
   Identifiable Information under an applicable law (hereinafter referred
   to as “Personal Information”)

   Users are not obligated to provide us with any information by law.
   However, we require certain information in order to operate
   properly. Under some jurisdictions (such as under certain E.U.
   regulations), a User has a right to withdraw its consent at any time.
   In such a case, the withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
   processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

   Please note that consent for the gathering and processing of data for
   one Service does not automatically mean that a User consents to the
   processing of data in connection with other Services. Controller should
   always make sure that the User’s consent is relevant, clear, valid, and
   to the extent reasonably possible, not “bundled” with any other written
   agreement (especially if required under applicable laws), unambiguous
   and if required under applicable law, affirmative and active (meaning
   not by virtue of any inaction).

   WalkMe aims to process only adequate, accurate and relevant data
   limited to the needs and purposes for which it is gathered. It also
   aims to store data for the time period necessary to fulfill the purpose
   for which the data is gathered. WalkMe only collects data in connection
   with a specific legitimate purpose and only processes data in
   accordance with this Privacy Policy.


   B.    MINORS

   We do not knowingly collect or solicit information or data from
   children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow children under the age
   of 13 to register for the WalkMe Service. If you are under 13, do not
   register or attempt to register for any of the WalkMe Service or send
   any information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have
   collected or have been sent Personal Information or Personal Data from
   a child under the age of 13, we reserve the right to delete that
   Personal Information or Personal Data as soon as reasonably
   practicable. If you believe that we might have collected or been sent
   information from a child under the age of 13, please contact our
   legal@walkme.com as soon as possible.


   C.    INFORMATION SECURITY

   We take great care in implementing, enforcing and maintaining the
   security of our Services, Site and Users’ information. WalkMe
   implements, enforces and maintains security policies to prevent the
   unauthorized or accidental access to or destruction, loss,
   modification, use or disclosure of Personal Information or Personal
   Data and to monitor compliance of such policies on an ongoing basis.
   The information is hosted on the Amazon Cloud in the United States
   which provides advanced security features and is compliant with the ISO
   27001 standard. All information is stored with logical separation from
   information of other Customers. However, we do not guarantee that
   unauthorized access will never occur.

   We use a combination of processes, technology and physical security
   controls to help protect Personal Information and Personal Data from
   unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When Personal Information or
   Personal Data is transferred over the Internet, we encrypt it using
   Transfer Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology or similar
   technology. Each server is protected by a firewall, exposing it only to
   the minimum ports necessary. However, no security controls are 100%
   effective, and we cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of
   your Personal Information and Personal Data.

   Unless otherwise agreed with the Customer and subject to applicable
   law, WalkMe shall act in accordance with its policies to promptly
   notify Customer in the event that any Personal Information or Personal
   Data processed by WalkMe on behalf of a Customer is lost, stolen, or
   where there has been any unauthorized access to it.

   WalkMe uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
   necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
   technology required to run the WalkMe Service. Where practical, we seek
   to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this
   Privacy Policy and that limit others’ use or disclosure of your
   Personal Information and Personal Information.


   D.    CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

   The terms of this Privacy Policy will govern the use of the Site and
   Service and any information collected in connection therewith, however,
