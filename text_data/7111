   'Personal data' means data that can identify you as a specific
   individual, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address,
   or other contact information, whether at work or at home.

   On all Company web sites that collect Personal data, we specifically
   describe what information is required in order to provide you with the
   product, service, or feature you have requested.

   We collect Personal data when you contact us, when you register with
   us, when you use our products and services, when you submit an order
   with us, when you visit our web sites or the web sites of certain of
   the Company's partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes.

   the goods or services to you by post, telephone or other direct way as
   well as to inquire the opinion of the Customers about the offered goods

   we may also collect information about what is watched and bought by
   you, at what price, in what amount or whether did you add specific
   products to the cart but did not buy them and use it to create a
   profile of your interests on the basis of content that we think was
   interesting for you (for example because you added it to the cart) as
   well as content that other users similar to you have found engaging. By
   using [this profile of your interests we can adapt our marketing
   materials by replacing the default content with content more relevant
   to your interests (for example we can show you games or other products
   that we think you might like instead of the default offers)

   restriction on processing, for example if you contest the accuracy of
   your personal data, it will be stored and processed otherwise only if

   Other Information Collected
   Some data may be collected automatically every time you visit the
   Company's web sites, such as cookies and computer data. In addition,
   data may be collected other independent, third-party sources. We also
   collect information about which pages you visit within this site. This
   site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.

   Cookies
   The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part
   of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric
   identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your
   computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to
   recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie
   expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains
   on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

   We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the our
   web sites. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which
   sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent
   cookies in areas of its web site you must register, and you are able to
   customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your
   preferences more than once.

   By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies
   are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of
   cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this site and
   you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an
   order during new or interrupted browser sessions.

   Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies
   on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies (see
   'Third Party Advertising' and 'Third Party Cookies' below).
   Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the
   Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

   Log Files
   As is true of most web sites, the Company gathers certain information
   automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes
   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services
   provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
   stamp, and clickstream data. The Company uses this information to
   analyze trends, to screen for fraud, to administer the Company's sites,
   to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather
   demographic information about the Company's user base as a whole.

   Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
   The Company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
   Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites
   by informing the Company what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
   graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and
   are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to
   cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs
   are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the
   period at the end of this sentence.

   The Company uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform itself
   of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the Company to
   gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
   of the Company's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of
   these e-mails, please see 'Choice and Opt-Out' section of this Privacy
   Policy.

   Special Offers and Updates
   The Company collects data about which sections of its web site you
   visit most often, so that it can send you our newsletter and data about
   relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which may
   interest you.

   Accordingly, the Company will occasionally send you information on
   products, services, special deals, promotions and sweepstakes.

   Service-related Announcements
   The Company may, but is not obligated, to send you strictly
   service-related announcements or rare occasions when it is necessary to
   do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for
   maintenance, we might send you an e-mail.

   Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications since they are
   not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you may
   have the option to deactivate your account.

   Research
   We also collect data for research purposes and to provide anonymous
   reporting for internal and external clients. The Company uses the data
   collected for its own internal marketing and demographic studies to
   improve customer service and product offerings.

   Customer Service
   We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide
   the products and services you request, and to manage your account. We
   will communicate with you by e-mail, live chat or telephone, in
   accordance with your wishes.

   Preferences
   The Company stores data that it collects through cookies, log files,
   and third party sources to create a profile of your preferences, in
   order to improve the content of the Company's web site for you.

   Service Providers
   The Company discloses the data collected to external service providers
   necessary to facilitate the following outsourced operations: address
   verification, fraud screening and order shipping.

   Third Parties

   administrative, telecommunications, computer, payment, debt collection,

   IGvault is an international company. If personal data is transferred
   from European Union outside European Economic Area, we make sure that
   adequate level of personal data protection is assured, for example by
   signing standard contractual clauses for transfer of data. .

   Links to Other Web Sites
   Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to
   the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers,
   sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the
   content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for
   the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In
   addition, these sites or services, including their content and links,
   may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own
   privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and
   interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link
   to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

   Storage and Security of Personal data Storage
   We will store your personal data for as long as we have lawful grounds
   to do so. Specific retention periods depend on the purpose and legal
   base of processing, for example:
   - personal data required to provide services, for the time of providing
   such services and after that, for the time required by legal provisions
   (e.g. on accountancy) or to handle possible claims
   - personal data that must have been collected for anti-money laundering
   legislation requirements, including for identification, screening and
   reporting, as a rule for 5 years after the termination of our
   relationship, unless we are required to retain this information for the
   purposes of court or administrative proceedings, or 8 years to handle
   possible claims
   - personal data processed on the basis of your consent, as a rule until
   such consent is withdrawn
   - personal data processed on the basis of a legitimate interest, as a
   rule until you file an effective objection.

   Security
   The Company protects the privacy and integrity of the data it collects
   by employing appropriate administrative protocols, technical
   safeguards, and physical security controls designed to limit access,
   detect and prevent the unauthorized access, improper disclosure,
   alteration, or destruction of the data under its control. The Company
   transmits the data used by its external service providers for the
   specific outsourced operations listed above across public and private
   networks via recognized encryption technologies, such as by using
   Secure Sockets layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the data you input.

   Although the Company follows the procedures set forth above to protect
   the Personal data submitted to the Company, no method of transmission
   over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
   Thus, while the Company strives to use commercially acceptable means to
   protect your Personal data, the Company cannot guarantee its absolute
   security.

   sites, please feel free to send us an e-mail at [email protected]

   Personal Data Collection and Use Personal data
   'Personal data' means data that can identify you as a specific

   product, service, or feature you have requested.

   We collect Personal data when you contact us, when you register with
   us, when you use our products and services, when you submit an order

   the Company's partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes.

   profile of your interests on the basis of content that we think was
   interesting for you (for example because you added it to the cart) as
   well as content that other users similar to you have found engaging. By
   using [this profile of your interests we can adapt our marketing
   materials by replacing the default content with content more relevant
   to your interests (for example we can show you games or other products
   that we think you might like instead of the default offers)

   Other Information Collected
   Some data may be collected automatically every time you visit the
   Company's web sites, such as cookies and computer data. In addition,
   data may be collected other independent, third-party sources. We also
   collect information about which pages you visit within this site. This
   site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.

   Cookies
   The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part
   of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric
   identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your
   computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to
   recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie
   expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains
   on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

   We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the our
   web sites. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which
   sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent
   cookies in areas of its web site you must register, and you are able to
   customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your
   preferences more than once.

   By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies
   are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of
   cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this site and
   you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an
   order during new or interrupted browser sessions.

   Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies
   on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies (see
   'Third Party Advertising' and 'Third Party Cookies' below).
   Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the
   Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

   Log Files
   As is true of most web sites, the Company gathers certain information
   automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes
   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services
   provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
   stamp, and clickstream data. The Company uses this information to
   analyze trends, to screen for fraud, to administer the Company's sites,
   to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather
   demographic information about the Company's user base as a whole.

   Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
   The Company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
   Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites
   by informing the Company what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
   graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and
   are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to
   cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs
   are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the
   period at the end of this sentence.

   The Company uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform itself
   of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the Company to
   gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
   of the Company's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of
   these e-mails, please see 'Choice and Opt-Out' section of this Privacy
   Policy.

   Special Offers and Updates
   The Company collects data about which sections of its web site you
   visit most often, so that it can send you our newsletter and data about
   relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which may
   interest you.

   Accordingly, the Company will occasionally send you information on
   products, services, special deals, promotions and sweepstakes.

   Service-related Announcements
   The Company may, but is not obligated, to send you strictly
   service-related announcements or rare occasions when it is necessary to
   do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for
   maintenance, we might send you an e-mail.

   Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications since they are
   not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you may
   have the option to deactivate your account.

   Research
   We also collect data for research purposes and to provide anonymous
   reporting for internal and external clients. The Company uses the data
   collected for its own internal marketing and demographic studies to
   improve customer service and product offerings.

   Customer Service
   We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide
   the products and services you request, and to manage your account. We
   will communicate with you by e-mail, live chat or telephone, in
   accordance with your wishes.

   Preferences
   The Company stores data that it collects through cookies, log files,
   and third party sources to create a profile of your preferences, in
   order to improve the content of the Company's web site for you.

   Service Providers
   The Company discloses the data collected to external service providers
   necessary to facilitate the following outsourced operations: address
   verification, fraud screening and order shipping.

   Third Parties
   We may transfer your personal data to the following categories of
   recipients:
   -other users of our products and services where this is necessary to
   perform our agreements with you, for example when you purchase a game
   from a seller on the IGVault or transfer funds to the another user;
   -other members of the Group;
   -agents, contractors, advisors or third parties who provide
   administrative, telecommunications, computer, payment, debt collection,
   data processing, legal or other services to igvault.com;

   data under applicable laws and regulations through a court order,
   subpoena or other legal process, such as supervisory bodies, regulators

   IGvault is an international company. If personal data is transferred
   from European Union outside European Economic Area, we make sure that
   adequate level of personal data protection is assured, for example by
   signing standard contractual clauses for transfer of data. .

   Links to Other Web Sites
   Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to
   the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers,
   sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the
   content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for
   the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In
   addition, these sites or services, including their content and links,
   may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own
   privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and
   interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link
   to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

   Storage and Security of Personal data Storage
   We will store your personal data for as long as we have lawful grounds
   to do so. Specific retention periods depend on the purpose and legal
   base of processing, for example:
   - personal data required to provide services, for the time of providing
   such services and after that, for the time required by legal provisions
   (e.g. on accountancy) or to handle possible claims
   - personal data that must have been collected for anti-money laundering
   legislation requirements, including for identification, screening and
   reporting, as a rule for 5 years after the termination of our
   relationship, unless we are required to retain this information for the
   purposes of court or administrative proceedings, or 8 years to handle
   possible claims
   - personal data processed on the basis of your consent, as a rule until
   such consent is withdrawn
   - personal data processed on the basis of a legitimate interest, as a
   rule until you file an effective objection.

   Security
   The Company protects the privacy and integrity of the data it collects
   by employing appropriate administrative protocols, technical
   safeguards, and physical security controls designed to limit access,
   detect and prevent the unauthorized access, improper disclosure,
   alteration, or destruction of the data under its control. The Company
   transmits the data used by its external service providers for the
   specific outsourced operations listed above across public and private
   networks via recognized encryption technologies, such as by using
   Secure Sockets layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the data you input.

   Although the Company follows the procedures set forth above to protect
   the Personal data submitted to the Company, no method of transmission
   over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
   Thus, while the Company strives to use commercially acceptable means to
   protect your Personal data, the Company cannot guarantee its absolute
   security.

   If you have any questions about the Company's security on the its web
   sites, please feel free to send us an e-mail at [email protected]

   attempt to access or acquire customer or other information on its web
   sites via illegal or surreptitious means. The Company works with local,
   national, and international fraud investigation agencies and employs a
   variety of electronic and other means to discourage, detect, and
   intercept fraudulent activities. The Company aggressively prosecutes,
   to the fullest extent of the law, those perpetrators apprehended
   conducting fraudulent activities on its web site.

   Agencies with which the Company cooperates are: state and local police
   authorities, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, US and
   International Customs Agencies, and Interpol.

   product, service, or feature you have requested.

   Other Information Collected
   Some data may be collected automatically every time you visit the
   Company's web sites, such as cookies and computer data. In addition,
   data may be collected other independent, third-party sources. We also
   collect information about which pages you visit within this site. This
   site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.

   Cookies
   The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part
   of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric
   identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your
   computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to
   recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie
   expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains
   on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

   We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the our
   web sites. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which
   sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent
   cookies in areas of its web site you must register, and you are able to
   customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your
   preferences more than once.

   By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies
   are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of
   cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this site and
   you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an
   order during new or interrupted browser sessions.

   Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies
   on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies (see
   'Third Party Advertising' and 'Third Party Cookies' below).
   Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the
   Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

   Log Files
   As is true of most web sites, the Company gathers certain information
   automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes
   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services
   provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
   stamp, and clickstream data. The Company uses this information to
   analyze trends, to screen for fraud, to administer the Company's sites,
   to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather
   demographic information about the Company's user base as a whole.

   Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
   The Company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
   Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites
   by informing the Company what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
   graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and
   are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to
   cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs
   are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the
   period at the end of this sentence.

   The Company uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform itself
   of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the Company to
   gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
   of the Company's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of
   these e-mails, please see 'Choice and Opt-Out' section of this Privacy
   Policy.

   Special Offers and Updates
   The Company collects data about which sections of its web site you
   visit most often, so that it can send you our newsletter and data about
   relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which may
   interest you.

   Accordingly, the Company will occasionally send you information on
   products, services, special deals, promotions and sweepstakes.

   Service-related Announcements
   The Company may, but is not obligated, to send you strictly
   service-related announcements or rare occasions when it is necessary to
   do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for
   maintenance, we might send you an e-mail.

   Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications since they are
   not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you may
   have the option to deactivate your account.

   Research
   We also collect data for research purposes and to provide anonymous
   reporting for internal and external clients. The Company uses the data
   collected for its own internal marketing and demographic studies to
   improve customer service and product offerings.

   Customer Service
   We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide
   the products and services you request, and to manage your account. We
   will communicate with you by e-mail, live chat or telephone, in
   accordance with your wishes.

   Preferences
   The Company stores data that it collects through cookies, log files,
   and third party sources to create a profile of your preferences, in
   order to improve the content of the Company's web site for you.

   Service Providers
   The Company discloses the data collected to external service providers
   necessary to facilitate the following outsourced operations: address
   verification, fraud screening and order shipping.

   Third Parties
   We may transfer your personal data to the following categories of
   recipients:
   -other users of our products and services where this is necessary to
   perform our agreements with you, for example when you purchase a game
   from a seller on the IGVault or transfer funds to the another user;
   -other members of the Group;
   -agents, contractors, advisors or third parties who provide
   administrative, telecommunications, computer, payment, debt collection,
   data processing, legal or other services to igvault.com;

   payment institutions or electronic money institutions) as well as card
   organizations (such as VISA or MasterCard) which  in connection with
   our payment services;

   data under applicable laws and regulations through a court order,
   subpoena or other legal process, such as supervisory bodies, regulators
   or law enforcement bodies;
   -other parties as notified to you at the time of collection.
   IGvault is an international company. If personal data is transferred
   from European Union outside European Economic Area, we make sure that
   adequate level of personal data protection is assured, for example by
   signing standard contractual clauses for transfer of data. .

   Links to Other Web Sites
   Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to
   the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers,
   sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the
   content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for
   the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In
   addition, these sites or services, including their content and links,
   may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own
   privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and
   interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link
   to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

   Storage and Security of Personal data Storage
   We will store your personal data for as long as we have lawful grounds
   to do so. Specific retention periods depend on the purpose and legal
   base of processing, for example:
   - personal data required to provide services, for the time of providing
   such services and after that, for the time required by legal provisions
   (e.g. on accountancy) or to handle possible claims
   - personal data that must have been collected for anti-money laundering
   legislation requirements, including for identification, screening and
   reporting, as a rule for 5 years after the termination of our
   relationship, unless we are required to retain this information for the
   purposes of court or administrative proceedings, or 8 years to handle
   possible claims
   - personal data processed on the basis of your consent, as a rule until
   such consent is withdrawn
   - personal data processed on the basis of a legitimate interest, as a
   rule until you file an effective objection.

   Security
   The Company protects the privacy and integrity of the data it collects
   by employing appropriate administrative protocols, technical
   safeguards, and physical security controls designed to limit access,
   detect and prevent the unauthorized access, improper disclosure,
   alteration, or destruction of the data under its control. The Company
   transmits the data used by its external service providers for the
   specific outsourced operations listed above across public and private
   networks via recognized encryption technologies, such as by using
   Secure Sockets layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the data you input.

   Although the Company follows the procedures set forth above to protect
   the Personal data submitted to the Company, no method of transmission
   over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
   Thus, while the Company strives to use commercially acceptable means to
   protect your Personal data, the Company cannot guarantee its absolute
   security.

   If you have any questions about the Company's security on the its web
   sites, please feel free to send us an e-mail at [email protected]

   attempt to access or acquire customer or other information on its web
   sites via illegal or surreptitious means. The Company works with local,
   national, and international fraud investigation agencies and employs a
   variety of electronic and other means to discourage, detect, and
   intercept fraudulent activities. The Company aggressively prosecutes,
   to the fullest extent of the law, those perpetrators apprehended
   conducting fraudulent activities on its web site.

   Agencies with which the Company cooperates are: state and local police
   authorities, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, US and

   Personal Data Collection and Use Personal data
   'Personal data' means data that can identify you as a specific

   describe what information is required in order to provide you with the
   product, service, or feature you have requested.

   We collect Personal data when you contact us, when you register with
   us, when you use our products and services, when you submit an order

   the Company's partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes.

   profile of your interests on the basis of content that we think was
   interesting for you (for example because you added it to the cart) as
   well as content that other users similar to you have found engaging. By
   using [this profile of your interests we can adapt our marketing
   materials by replacing the default content with content more relevant
   to your interests (for example we can show you games or other products
   that we think you might like instead of the default offers)

   Other Information Collected
   Some data may be collected automatically every time you visit the
   Company's web sites, such as cookies and computer data. In addition,
   data may be collected other independent, third-party sources. We also
   collect information about which pages you visit within this site. This
   site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.

   Cookies
   The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part
   of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric
   identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your
   computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to
   recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie
   expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains
   on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

   We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the our
   web sites. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which
   sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent
   cookies in areas of its web site you must register, and you are able to
   customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your
   preferences more than once.

   By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies
   are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of
   cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this site and
   you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an
   order during new or interrupted browser sessions.

   Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies
   on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies (see
   'Third Party Advertising' and 'Third Party Cookies' below).
   Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the
   Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

   Log Files
   As is true of most web sites, the Company gathers certain information
   automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes
   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services
   provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
   stamp, and clickstream data. The Company uses this information to
   analyze trends, to screen for fraud, to administer the Company's sites,
   to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather
   demographic information about the Company's user base as a whole.

   Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
   The Company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
   Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites
   by informing the Company what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
   graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and
   are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to
   cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs
   are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the
   period at the end of this sentence.

   The Company uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform itself
   of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the Company to
   gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
   of the Company's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of
   these e-mails, please see 'Choice and Opt-Out' section of this Privacy
   Policy.

   Special Offers and Updates
   The Company collects data about which sections of its web site you
   visit most often, so that it can send you our newsletter and data about
   relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which may
   interest you.

   Accordingly, the Company will occasionally send you information on
   products, services, special deals, promotions and sweepstakes.

   Service-related Announcements
   The Company may, but is not obligated, to send you strictly
   service-related announcements or rare occasions when it is necessary to
   do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for
   maintenance, we might send you an e-mail.

   Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications since they are
   not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you may
   have the option to deactivate your account.

   Research
   We also collect data for research purposes and to provide anonymous
   reporting for internal and external clients. The Company uses the data
   collected for its own internal marketing and demographic studies to
   improve customer service and product offerings.

   Customer Service
   We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide
   the products and services you request, and to manage your account. We
   will communicate with you by e-mail, live chat or telephone, in
   accordance with your wishes.

   Preferences
   The Company stores data that it collects through cookies, log files,
   and third party sources to create a profile of your preferences, in
   order to improve the content of the Company's web site for you.

   Service Providers
   The Company discloses the data collected to external service providers
   necessary to facilitate the following outsourced operations: address
   verification, fraud screening and order shipping.

   Third Parties
   We may transfer your personal data to the following categories of
   recipients:

   perform our agreements with you, for example when you purchase a game
   from a seller on the IGVault or transfer funds to the another user;
   -other members of the Group;
   -agents, contractors, advisors or third parties who provide
   administrative, telecommunications, computer, payment, debt collection,
   data processing, legal or other services to igvault.com;

   payment institutions or electronic money institutions) as well as card
   organizations (such as VISA or MasterCard) which  in connection with
   our payment services;

   data under applicable laws and regulations through a court order,
   subpoena or other legal process, such as supervisory bodies, regulators
   or law enforcement bodies;
   -other parties as notified to you at the time of collection.
   IGvault is an international company. If personal data is transferred
   from European Union outside European Economic Area, we make sure that
   adequate level of personal data protection is assured, for example by
   signing standard contractual clauses for transfer of data. .

   Links to Other Web Sites
   Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to
   the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers,
   sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the
   content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for
   the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In
   addition, these sites or services, including their content and links,
   may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own
   privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and
   interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link
   to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

   Storage and Security of Personal data Storage
   We will store your personal data for as long as we have lawful grounds
   to do so. Specific retention periods depend on the purpose and legal
   base of processing, for example:
   - personal data required to provide services, for the time of providing
   such services and after that, for the time required by legal provisions
   (e.g. on accountancy) or to handle possible claims
   - personal data that must have been collected for anti-money laundering
   legislation requirements, including for identification, screening and
   reporting, as a rule for 5 years after the termination of our
   relationship, unless we are required to retain this information for the
   purposes of court or administrative proceedings, or 8 years to handle
   possible claims
   - personal data processed on the basis of your consent, as a rule until
   such consent is withdrawn
   - personal data processed on the basis of a legitimate interest, as a
   rule until you file an effective objection.

   Security
   The Company protects the privacy and integrity of the data it collects
   by employing appropriate administrative protocols, technical
   safeguards, and physical security controls designed to limit access,
   detect and prevent the unauthorized access, improper disclosure,
   alteration, or destruction of the data under its control. The Company
   transmits the data used by its external service providers for the
   specific outsourced operations listed above across public and private
   networks via recognized encryption technologies, such as by using
   Secure Sockets layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the data you input.

   Although the Company follows the procedures set forth above to protect
   the Personal data submitted to the Company, no method of transmission
   over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
   Thus, while the Company strives to use commercially acceptable means to
   protect your Personal data, the Company cannot guarantee its absolute
   security.

   If you have any questions about the Company's security on the its web
   sites, please feel free to send us an e-mail at [email protected]

   attempt to access or acquire customer or other information on its web
   sites via illegal or surreptitious means. The Company works with local,
   national, and international fraud investigation agencies and employs a
   variety of electronic and other means to discourage, detect, and
   intercept fraudulent activities. The Company aggressively prosecutes,
   to the fullest extent of the law, those perpetrators apprehended
   conducting fraudulent activities on its web site.

   authorities, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, US and

   Game Information

   Game Developer：Telltale Games

   Release Date：2011/11/17

   In-game Language： / English / German / Spanish / French / Italian
   Product Description

Notice:Java Edition can't connect to Windows 10 servers and Windows 10 can't
connect to Java Edition servers.

   Minecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people
   built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game
   grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.

   It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise
   over a blocky ocean. It’s pretty. Brave players battle terrible things
   in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a
   land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea.

   product, service, or feature you have requested.

   to your interests (for example we can show you games or other products
   that we think you might like instead of the default offers)

   Other Information Collected
   Some data may be collected automatically every time you visit the
   Company's web sites, such as cookies and computer data. In addition,
   data may be collected other independent, third-party sources. We also
   collect information about which pages you visit within this site. This
   site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.

   Cookies
   The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part
   of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric
   identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your
   computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to
   recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie
   expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains
   on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

   We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the our
   web sites. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which
   sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent
   cookies in areas of its web site you must register, and you are able to
   customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your
   preferences more than once.

   By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies
   are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of
   cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this site and
   you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an
   order during new or interrupted browser sessions.

   Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies
   on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies (see
   'Third Party Advertising' and 'Third Party Cookies' below).
   Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the
   Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

   Log Files
   As is true of most web sites, the Company gathers certain information
   automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes
   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services
   provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
   stamp, and clickstream data. The Company uses this information to
   analyze trends, to screen for fraud, to administer the Company's sites,
   to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather
   demographic information about the Company's user base as a whole.

   Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
   The Company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
   Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites
   by informing the Company what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
   graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and
   are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to
   cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs
   are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the
   period at the end of this sentence.

   The Company uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform itself
   of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the Company to
   gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
   of the Company's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of
   these e-mails, please see 'Choice and Opt-Out' section of this Privacy
   Policy.

   Special Offers and Updates
   The Company collects data about which sections of its web site you
   visit most often, so that it can send you our newsletter and data about
   relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which may
   interest you.

   Accordingly, the Company will occasionally send you information on
   products, services, special deals, promotions and sweepstakes.

   Service-related Announcements
   The Company may, but is not obligated, to send you strictly
   service-related announcements or rare occasions when it is necessary to
   do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for
   maintenance, we might send you an e-mail.

   Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications since they are
   not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you may
   have the option to deactivate your account.

   Research
   We also collect data for research purposes and to provide anonymous
   reporting for internal and external clients. The Company uses the data
   collected for its own internal marketing and demographic studies to
   improve customer service and product offerings.

   Customer Service
   We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide
   the products and services you request, and to manage your account. We
   will communicate with you by e-mail, live chat or telephone, in
   accordance with your wishes.

   Preferences
   The Company stores data that it collects through cookies, log files,
   and third party sources to create a profile of your preferences, in
   order to improve the content of the Company's web site for you.

   Service Providers
   The Company discloses the data collected to external service providers
   necessary to facilitate the following outsourced operations: address
   verification, fraud screening and order shipping.

   Third Parties
   We may transfer your personal data to the following categories of
   recipients:

   perform our agreements with you, for example when you purchase a game
   from a seller on the IGVault or transfer funds to the another user;
   -other members of the Group;
   -agents, contractors, advisors or third parties who provide
   administrative, telecommunications, computer, payment, debt collection,
   data processing, legal or other services to igvault.com;

   data under applicable laws and regulations through a court order,

   IGvault is an international company. If personal data is transferred
   from European Union outside European Economic Area, we make sure that
   adequate level of personal data protection is assured, for example by
   signing standard contractual clauses for transfer of data. .

   Links to Other Web Sites
   Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to
   the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers,
   sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the
   content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for
   the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In
   addition, these sites or services, including their content and links,
   may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own
   privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and
   interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link
   to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

   Storage and Security of Personal data Storage
   We will store your personal data for as long as we have lawful grounds
   to do so. Specific retention periods depend on the purpose and legal
   base of processing, for example:
   - personal data required to provide services, for the time of providing
   such services and after that, for the time required by legal provisions
   (e.g. on accountancy) or to handle possible claims
   - personal data that must have been collected for anti-money laundering
   legislation requirements, including for identification, screening and
   reporting, as a rule for 5 years after the termination of our
   relationship, unless we are required to retain this information for the
   purposes of court or administrative proceedings, or 8 years to handle
   possible claims
   - personal data processed on the basis of your consent, as a rule until
   such consent is withdrawn
   - personal data processed on the basis of a legitimate interest, as a
   rule until you file an effective objection.

   Security
   The Company protects the privacy and integrity of the data it collects
   by employing appropriate administrative protocols, technical
   safeguards, and physical security controls designed to limit access,
   detect and prevent the unauthorized access, improper disclosure,
   alteration, or destruction of the data under its control. The Company
   transmits the data used by its external service providers for the
   specific outsourced operations listed above across public and private
   networks via recognized encryption technologies, such as by using
   Secure Sockets layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the data you input.

   Although the Company follows the procedures set forth above to protect
   the Personal data submitted to the Company, no method of transmission
   over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
   Thus, while the Company strives to use commercially acceptable means to
   protect your Personal data, the Company cannot guarantee its absolute
   security.

   If you have any questions about the Company's security on the its web
   sites, please feel free to send us an e-mail at [email protected]

   sites via illegal or surreptitious means. The Company works with local,

   giving players the chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of
   Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way across both Story
   Mode and Grand Theft Auto Online.

   Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus,
   starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world,
   now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and
   cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals
   risk everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could
   set them up for life.

   The biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created and
   now packed with layers of new detail, Grand Theft Auto V blends
   storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and
   out of the lives of the game’s three lead characters, playing all sides
   of the game’s interwoven story.

   Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, the
   ever-evolving Grand Theft Auto universe. Explore the vast world or rise
   through the criminal ranks by banding together to complete Jobs for
   cash, purchase properties, vehicles and character upgrades, compete in
   traditional competitive modes, or create new content to play and share
   with the Grand Theft Auto community.

   All new content and gameplay created and released since the launch of
   Grand Theft Auto Online including new Jobs, an arsenal of new weapons,
   scores of new vehicles, new properties and player customizations will
   also be available in Grand Theft Auto Online for PC. In addition, the
   current community of players will have the ability to transfer their
   Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to their choice of
   PlayStation®4, Xbox One or PC.

   Grand Theft Auto V for PC will also feature a video editor designed for
   advanced movie-making.
