   you should read carefully the Terms and also our ‘Privacy and Cookie
   Policy’.

   These Terms cover your use of this Site. All products and services
   provided by members of the Generali Group have their own terms and
   conditions (the ‘Product Terms’). You must read both the Product Terms
   and these Terms. To the extent that the Product Terms conflict with
   these Terms or any local sites’ terms and conditions then the Product
   Terms will prevail.

   Please make sure you read carefully all applicable terms, conditions
   and disclaimers relevant to your use of the products, services or
   information that may be offered to you from time to time.

   If any part of these Terms is found by any court or other competent
   authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable then such part shall
   be severed from the rest of the Terms which shall continue to be valid
   and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

   CHANGES TO OUR TERMS

   The information on this Site is regularly updated. The validity of the
   information provided on this Site is restricted to the point in time in
   which it was published and to our assessment at that point in time.

   accuracy, suitability, completeness or availability of this Site or the
   information contained therein. Generali Investments does not assume any
   responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from the use of the

   information does not take into account individual circumstances,
   investment objectives, financial situation or specific needs of the
   investors. The Site does not refer to any particular tax treatment. Tax
   regimes depend on each potential client’s own circumstances and may be

   Only investors can decide if the transactions they might engage in are

   resulting from an investment in Units/Shares of UCITS depends on the
   situation of each investor. We recommend that investors consult their
   usual tax advisor.

   statutorily required documents, which are made available before an
   investment decision.

   All Fund documents (Prospectus, KIIDs, annual and semi-annual reports)
   are available in the language required by the country/-ies where the
   relevant product is registered at www.generali-investments.com .

   Paper copies of any Fund documents may be requested from the local

   RISK CONSIDERATIONS

   The value of the shares may fall as well as rise and you may not get
   back the amount initially invested. Investing in a Fund involves
   multiple risks including the loss of capital.

   The net asset value of some classes is subject to a high volatility,
   which may result in major latent short-term losses.

   For more information about the inherent risks of any Fund or sub-fund,
   please read the latest version in force of the prospectus, the articles
   of incorporation, the Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) and
   the latest annual and semi-annual report. Please pay attention to the
   sections of the prospectus related to risks.

   and class presented in the KIIDs and in the prospectus.

   following terms and conditions (the ‘Terms‘). Before using this Site,
   you should read carefully the Terms and also our ‘Privacy and Cookie
   Policy’.

   These Terms cover your use of this Site. All products and services
   provided by members of the Generali Group have their own terms and
   conditions (the ‘Product Terms’). You must read both the Product Terms
   and these Terms. To the extent that the Product Terms conflict with
   these Terms or any local sites’ terms and conditions then the Product
   Terms will prevail.

   Please make sure you read carefully all applicable terms, conditions
   and disclaimers relevant to your use of the products, services or
   information that may be offered to you from time to time.

   If any part of these Terms is found by any court or other competent
   authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable then such part shall
   be severed from the rest of the Terms which shall continue to be valid
   and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

   CHANGES TO OUR TERMS

   The information on this Site is regularly updated. The validity of the
   information provided on this Site is restricted to the point in time in
   which it was published and to our assessment at that point in time.
   Generali Investments does not assume any liability for the correctness,
   accuracy, suitability, completeness or availability of this Site or the
   information contained therein. Generali Investments does not assume any
   responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from the use of the
   information contained on this Site for any other than its intended
   purpose. Generali Investments reserves the right to amend or supplement
   the information on this Site at any time without advance notice.

   ABSENCE OF ADVICE

   The information contained on this Site does not constitute a
   recommendation or an offer to persons in countries in which a
   corresponding offer is not permissible, nor an offer to persons to whom
   a corresponding offer must not be made or who must not be solicited to
   buy Units/Shares. Nothing contained on the Site constitutes investment,
   legal, tax or other advice nor is to be relied on in making an
   investment or other decision.

   INVESTMENT SUITABILITY

   A Fund may not be suitable or appropriate for all investors. The
   information does not take into account individual circumstances,
   investment objectives, financial situation or specific needs of the
   investors. The Site does not refer to any particular tax treatment. Tax
   regimes depend on each potential client’s own circumstances and may be
   subject to change in the future.

   Only investors can decide if the transactions they might engage in are
   suitable to their own financial situation. The fiscal treatment
   resulting from an investment in Units/Shares of UCITS depends on the
   situation of each investor. We recommend that investors consult their
   usual tax advisor.

   Changes in the economic, legal or tax conditions or other events may
   influence the future development of the market or individual products
   at any time in a manner other than as described in the information
   provided on this Site.

   ACCESS TO FUND DOCUMENTS

   The sole binding basis for the acquisition of Units is the prospectus
   as amended from time to time and the key investor information and the
   relevant annual and half-yearly reports (if available) and/or the
   statutorily required documents, which are made available before an
   investment decision.

   All Fund documents (Prospectus, KIIDs, annual and semi-annual reports)
   are available in the language required by the country/-ies where the
   relevant product is registered at www.generali-investments.com .

   Paper copies of any Fund documents may be requested from the local
   agents of your country of residence, free of charge. The list of all
   local agents is available in any of our Fund prospectuses.

   PERFORMANCE FIGURES

   Past performances displayed on the Site are not a reliable indicator of
   future performance and may be misleading. There could have been a
   fluctuation in returns since the posting of information on this Site.

   RISK CONSIDERATIONS

   The value of the shares may fall as well as rise and you may not get
   back the amount initially invested. Investing in a Fund involves
   multiple risks including the loss of capital.

   The net asset value of some classes is subject to a high volatility,
   which may result in major latent short-term losses.

   For more information about the inherent risks of any Fund or sub-fund,
   please read the latest version in force of the prospectus, the articles
   of incorporation, the Key Investor Information Documents (KIIDs) and
   the latest annual and semi-annual report. Please pay attention to the
   sections of the prospectus related to risks.

   COSTS

   Please also pay attention to the costs and fees of each Fund, sub-fund
   and class presented in the KIIDs and in the prospectus.

   MIFID INVESTMENT PROFILES

   For the purpose of this web-site, Institutional Investor indicates the
   MiFID category of Eligible Counterparties (ECP). This category receives
   the lowest level of protection under MiFID and it refers to an entity
   to which a credit institution or an investment firm provides the
   services of reception and transmission of orders on behalf of clients
   and/or execution of such orders and/or dealing on own account:

   a. Investment Firms or other investment firms;
   b. Credit institutions;
   c. Insurance companies;
   d. UCITS and UCITS management companies;
   e. Pension funds and their management companies;
   f. Other financial institutions authorized by a Member State or
   regulated under Community legislation or the national law of a Member
   State;
   g. Commodity dealers and ‘locals’ on exchanges;
   h. National governments and their corresponding offices, including
   public bodies that deal with public debt;
   i. Central banks and supranational institutions.

   If such clients are provided with investment advice, they will be
   treated as Professional clients instead.

   It is the responsibility to the subject that enters in the area of the
   web-site denominated “Institutional Investors” to verify its own
   quality and the belonging to such category.

   For the purpose of this web-site, Professional Investor refers to the
   entities that are not classified as an Eligible counterparty according
   to MiFID but who possesses the experience, knowledge and expertise to
   make its own investment decisions and properly assess the risks.

   In order to be considered as a Professional Investor, the client or
   prospective client shall be:

   (i) an entity authorized or regulated to operate in the financial
   markets, such as:

   (a) Credit institutions;
   (b) Investment Firms;
   (c) Other authorized or regulated financial institutions;
   (d) Insurance undertakings;
   (e) Collective investment schemes and management companies of such
   schemes;
   (f) Pension funds and management companies of such funds;
   (g) Commodity and commodity derivatives dealers;
   (h) Locals;

   2. Net turnover of at least EUR 40 million;
   3. Own capital of at least EUR 2 million.

   public debt, central banks, international and supranational
   institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
   the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank and other
   similar international organizations.

   (iv) Other institutional investors whose main activity is to invest in
   financial instruments, including entities dedicated to the
   securitization of assets or other financial transactions. The entities
   mentioned above are considered to be professionals.

   This category receives a lower level of protection than Retail clients

   It is the responsibility to the subject that enters in the area of the
   web-site denominated “Professional Investors” to verify its own quality
   and the belonging to such category.

   For the purpose of this web-site, Private Investor indicates the MiFID
   category of Retail clients. All the clients or prospective clients that
   do not fall under the classification of Professional Investors or
   Institutional Investors have to be considered as Private Investors
   according to this web-site.

   This is the classification that offers the most protection and imposes
   the most requirements in terms of communication, disclosure and
   transparency.

   It is the responsibility to the subject that enters in the area of the
   web-site denominated “Private Investor” to verify its own quality and
   the belonging to such category.
