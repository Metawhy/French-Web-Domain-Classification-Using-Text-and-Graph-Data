   Supplies:
     * Polymer Clay (88 cents a block at Wal-Mart, Or Online here)
     * Silk Flowers (Craft Section of Wal-Mart, Or Online Here) OR make
       your own small paper flowers!
     * Ribbon
     * Felt scraps for the ears (I cut them free hand)
     * Glue (Gorilla Glue, Or a Hot Glue Gun Works Well)
     * Ornaments - either buy them with the glitter already inside, or
       glitter your own, with polycrylic and glitter.  (I buy mine when
       they are on sale at Michaels)

   Make Them:

     How to Glitter the inside of clear ornaments, with polycrylic

     Roll the sculpy into small balls, then flatten out to make long
   "cone" shapes.  (Gold and white are a really pretty combination for
   these, especially if glitter the insides of the ornaments in pastel
   colors rather than white!)  Twist colors together.  Bake according to
   the directions on the package.

     For the flowers, I used silk flowers from the craft section.  You
   could very easily make your own small paper flowers with your cricut
   for these, but since I have not yet done that, I'm not sure what size
   to make them.

     Cut rounded traiangles from felt for the ears

     Use your cricut to cut eyelashes from a scrap of 651 vinyl - use
   transfer tape to apply the eyelashes to the ornament

     Glue on the horn, ears, and flowers

     Add ribbon
   [20171215_100634.jpg]
   You can easily add names to the bottom, or back, or these too!

   Tips:
   [23226832_10154827238205458_1708437178_n.jpg]
   Polycrylic & Polyurethene are not the same thing.
   You want Polycrylic for  making glitter ornaments.
     *  The Glitter ornaments can be made with hairspray, mop and glo, or
       Polycrylic.  Personally, I only use Polycrylic.  It works well for
       me, and I just do not trust the other methods to hold up in our hot
       attic over the summers.
     *  The "disc" (flatter circles)  ornaments are SO much easier to
       place vinyl on.
     * When placing a vinyl design on an ornament, fold the design in
       half, and place the center "fold" down first, working out one side
       at a time.
     * How To Make A Split Monogram
     * My favorite FREE Cutting Fonts To Use In Design Space
     * Free Alternatives To The Samantha Font (Free fonts with lots of
       glyphs and swirls and tails)
     * How to Find & Use Font Glyphs

   [23226967_10154826421980458_702334832_n.jpg]
   Pull the wire up, as shown on the right.
   Place the lid on the ornament, then press the top down.
   You are less likely to scratch the glitter this way!

Making Floating Christmas Ornaments With Vellum Instead Of Acetate

   [20191007_142140.jpg]
   On the left is vellum, on the right is printable acetate.
   Neither ornament is done here - to be finished they will get vinyl
   names on the outside, and bows..  and possibly the birth
   date/height/weight on the back...
   While making our grandsons newborn ornaments today, I tried them on
   both the printable acetate, and the inkjet vellum.  For this project, I
   still prefer the acetate.  Although when I hung them both on a  lighted
   tree, the vellum does show up much better.  I think I am going to like
   the vellum a lot better for the Memory ornaments I am making this year.
   Quick Links:
     * The Inkjet Printable Acetate I Use
     * Tutorial - Making Printable Acetate Ornaments, Step By Step
     * The Inkjet Vellum I Used Today
     * The Printer I use  - An HP Envy 7800
     * Instant Ink - If you have an HP Printer, this will save you SO Much
       money on ink!
     * Ornaments are the smaller flat discs from Michaels
     * I use the free insert svg found here
     * Cricut Design Space limits all print then cut projects to 6.75 x
       9.25 in size

   [91-TOVdQ%252BdL._AC_SL1500_.jpg]
   This is a good thick vellum, perfect for use in Inkjet Printers
   https://amzn.to/2oY1fG8
   I use a Cricut Air 2, and it refused to acknowledge this vellum for
   print then cut today.  It insisted it could not find the sensor marks.
   I turned the lights on, I turned the lights off, I pulled the curtains,
   I switched from a green mat to a blue mat...  no luck.  I tried on the
   clear acetate, it cut perfectly on the first try.  So I placed a sheet
   of white paper behind the vellum, and sure enough, it read the marks
   and cut just fine.  Why it can not find the marks on white vellum, but
   CAN on clear acetate, I just simply do not know.
   So to make this easier, print yourself a print then cut frame.  This is
   very simple to do.  Go to Design Space, Choose the "Add shape" tool on
   the left, and choose a square.  At the top of the screen, click on the
   lock to unlock the size, then type beside the W 6.75 and beside the  L
   9.25  That is the largest a image can be for print then cut.
   [Annotation%2B2019-10-07%2B131542.jpg]
   I use HP Instant Ink, which means I pay by the page no matter what is
   on the page.  It costs me exactly the same to print the word "test" on
   a sheet of paper, as it does to print a dark full color photo.  So I
   didn't bother to try to save ink here.  But if you pay for your ink,
   you will want to make this a very light grey color, or slice the center
   of the shape out, so that you are not printing a full page of color.
   [Annotation%2B2019-10-07%2B131601.jpg]
   At the top left of the screen, under fill, choose Print, to make this a
   print then cut project.
   Next, send your project to your printer, printing it on a piece of good
   white card stock,  then place it on a mat and insert it into your
   cricut to cut.
   Now you have a print then cut frame.  Make your print then cut project
   on the vellum, place it on your mat, then place the frame you just made
   from cardstock (which has a black outline to show the machine where to
   cut) over your vellum.  Use Painters Tape to tape the "frame" to the
   mat.
   [20191007_130917.jpg]
   This is NOT following my directions above.
   This was about my 5th attempt to get the machine to cut the vellum.
   I simply stuck the white sheet of paper underneath
   Then I taped the vellum on top. I do not recommend this.
   Because the vellum is not stuck to the mat in the middle
   It will move when cut, and it gets bent and crinkled.
   [20191007_131122.jpg]
   This is a comparison of the prints - vellum on the left, acetate on the
   right.
   If you are looking for how to get the photos on the shape, follow the
   tutorial found here:
   https://fieldsofhether.blogspot.com/2017/11/making-printable-acetate-ch
   ristmas.html
   [20191007_143355.jpg]
   And here's a comparison of them held up in the light.
   Left is vellum, right is Acetate.

  Pay By The Page, Not The Cartridge - Saving Money With HP Instant Ink

   [161129_HP_CorpBanners_300x250.jpg]
   try.hpinstantink.com/pNJBV
   When you sign up for an HP Instant Ink plan, you pay a monthly fee to
   print a defined number of pages per month. The plans are based on the
   number of pages that you print, not on how many ink cartridges you
   use.
   My ink costs will be under $50 this year. Total.
    It used to be twice that, at least, and I wasn't even printing nearly
   as much.   I've printed at least a dozen cookbooks this year alone.
   The only catch is that you have to have an instant ink compatible HP
   printer, but I think all of the newer printers are compatible.  I've
   been using this for 6 months now, and wish I had learned about this so
   much sooner!  The

   When you sign up for an HP Instant Ink plan, you pay a monthly fee to
   print a defined number of pages per month. The plans are based on the
   number of pages that you print, not on how many ink cartridges you
   use.
   Your monthly fee pays for ink, shipping, and recycling.
    If you do not print all of your plan pages in a month, you can roll
   over up to two times the number of pages per month in your plan. ( For
   the $0 plan, only unused additional pages that were purchased roll over
   into the next month. Free pages do not roll over.)
    If you print more pages, there is an additional charge but you are
   still paying the same price per page as your base plan.  OR, you can
   login and up your plan to the next level before the billing cycle.
   When I realized I was going to go way over my 50 pages last month, I
   simply logged in and bumped up to the $4.99 a month plan, giving me 100
   pages.  I'll stay at that rate through the holidays, when I print a lot
   more, and I can go back to a lower plan for the summer months when I am
   not printing nearly as much.
    A printed page counts the same whether it’s black and white, a color
   document, or a photo.
