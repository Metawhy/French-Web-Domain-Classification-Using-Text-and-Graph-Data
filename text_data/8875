How Do You Track Your Campaigns?

   In every case, Voluum Affiliate Tracker will make it better.

I don’t use a tracker

   Without an affiliate tracker, you’re burning money and wasting time.
   Get Voluum to target your campaigns precisely and optimize for
   efficiency.
   View comparison

I use a self-hosted tracker

   Self-hosted affiliate trackers equal hidden costs: complex setup,
   constant updates, security breaches. Focus on scaling. Save on
   infrastructure.
   View comparison

I use a cloud-based tracker

   Does it offer you notifications, bot detection, individual onboarding
   or AI-based features? We do. Get one solution. Solve many problems.
   View comparison

   I used nearly every tracking tool on the market and I always come back
   to Voluum. It provides the most user-friendly interface and has the
   in-depth reporting features I need.
   Voluum contributed massively to my business growth - from $1M a year to
   $3M. It’s intuitive and user-friendly, giving me the ability to manage
   large sets of advertising data.
   Voluum gave us the opportunity to skip endless, routine reporting jobs
   and optimize our campaigns easily with real-time reporting and API
   integration.
   The super-friendly, lightweight user interface and support are
   excellent. To sum it up in two words: It Rocks!
   Voluum has been the foundation of our tracking system. It provides us
   with all we need to optimize and grow our sales.
   We use Voluum to track our Mobile campaigns, without errors or
   downtime.
   I have used Voluum since it was in BETA in 2014. Their GUI is the best
   as well as the Mobile App. It's my go to tracker for performance
   campaigns.
   I am a solo affiliate who saved thousands of dollars with Traffic
   Distribution AI. Voluum is taking care of my campaigns with
   zero-downtime for more than 5 years. It never missed a single click.

   How to contact us?

   You can contact us using the contact form that can be found on our
   website (www.codewise.com/contact/) or via e-mail: hello@codewise.com.
   You can also contact our data protection officer: dpo@codewise.com.
   Why do we need your personal data and what is our legal basis for using
   them?

   We process your personal data because it is necessary to conclude
   contract with you and to perform the contract concluded with you, i.e.
   to:
     * registering your account,
     * maintaining your customer account, providing you with our services
       and customer support, handling transaction and issuing invoices,
     * handle with your requests and inquiries in relation to the
       provision of our services.

   We also process your personal data for the purposes set out below,
   based on our legitimate interest, which is:
     * improving our services, detecting frauds and monitoring compliance
       with our Terms & Conditions in order to provide you with the
       highest quality services,
     * pursuing claims or defending against claims, e.g. when you are not
       satisfied with our services and we need to handle your claims or
       chargebacks,
     * conducting surveys, analyse and storing data for archiving or
       statistical purposes, and ensuring accountability,
     * marketing activities related to you, including direct marketing of
       our own services, as well as contacting with you for purposes
       related to permitted marketing activities.

   In addition, the law requires us to process your data for tax and
   accounting purposes.

   We also ask you for your voluntary consent for specific form of
   marketing: sending commercial information via e-mail/sending newsletter
   or communicating with you by phone or skype for marketing purposes in
   accordance with applicable law (law on telecommunications, act on
   provision of services by electronic means).

   Legal basis: art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. GDPR
   Is processing of personal data voluntary?

   Yes, the processing of your personal data is voluntary. You don’t have
   to give us your data (like an e-mail address) but it will help us
   contact you or share with you latest information about our promotions
   and offers (our marketing purposes). If you do not provide us with this
   information, we will not be able to do it. You also don’t need to agree
   to the receiving of commercial information via e-mail from us – it is
   always your choice.
   In what situations can you object to the processing of your personal
   data?

   You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data
   when:
     * the processing of your personal data is based on a legitimate
       interest or for statistical purposes, and the opposition is
       justified by the particular situation in which you have found
       yourself,
     * your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes,
       including profiling for this purpose.

   To whom we may disclose your data?

   We will make efforts to process your data on our own. However, we may
   need to disclose your personal data to service providers acting on our
   behalf, e.g. IT services, analytical services, advertising services,
   cloud or host services providers.
   Do we transfer your data outside the EEA?

   We may transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area,
   i.e. to the territory of United States of America for which the
   European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision (Privacy Shield),
   in order to protect storage and processing of data using IT services,
   as well as operating the site and providing our services. The EU-U.S.
   Privacy Shield framework is a "partial" adequacy decision (concern only
   the companies committing to abiding by the binding Privacy Shield
   principles).

   In such cases your personal data will be transferred to the territory
   of USA in accordance with applicable laws and with appropriate
   safeguards in place only to Privacy Shield certified vendors or by
   using standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission,
   or based on other applicable transborder data transfer mechanisms.

   If you are located in the EEA, you may contact us and require a copy of
   the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your data
   transferred outside of the EEA and your privacy rights in these
   circumstances.

   Commission Decision on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of
   personal data to processors established in third countries here

   We will be processing your data no longer than necessary for the
   completion of the above-mentioned purposes. Additionally, you can at
   any time object to it by contacting us (as described in section “How to
   contact us?” above). In these circumstances, your personal data will be
   processed until you object to it. Where you have consented to marketing
   communications via e-mail for our marketing purposes (e.g. you agree to
   receive our newsletter), you may withdraw your consent at any time by
   contacting as well as you may unsubscribe from newsletter at any time

   circumstances, your personal data will be processed until you withdraw

       forgotten”)

     * the right to withdraw at any time your consent to processing of
       your personal data, to the extent to which it is processed on this
       basis, however, the withdrawal of consent does not affect the
       compliance of the processing which was made on its basis before the
       withdrawal of the consent
     * the right to data portability.
