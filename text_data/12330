   d=5858443815001

How to use the Schematic Symbols and PCB Footprints:

    1. Install Library Loader - The PCB Part Libraries require FREE
       Library Loader software to convert them into your ECAD tool format.
    2. Run the Library Loader from its desktop shortcut. Library Loader
       Icon
    3. Open your ECAD tool, and the libraries will already be loaded
       automatically.
    4. When browsing Mouser's parts, simply click the component ECAD Model
       symbol from the Mouser site and drop it into your design. Once
       selected, the schematic symbols, PCB footprints and 3D models are
       immediately available for use and placement.
    5. If a part doesn't have a symbol or footprint when clicking on the
       icon to download, you can build one or request a part. To build,
       simply use the wizard from SamacSys to create both the schematic
       symbol and PCB footprint. To request a part, fill in the required
       information, including your email, and SamacSys will contact you
       once their engineering team has completed the build.

The Easy Way to Get Symbols, PCB Footprints & 3D Models

   SamacSys and Mouser are delivering a simple, click & drop solution for
   schematic symbols, PCB footprints and 3D models for millions of parts
   that's FREE to all engineers to use. It also integrates on install into
   all major ECAD tools.

   d=5858443815001

How to use the Schematic Symbols and PCB Footprints:

    1. Install Library Loader - The PCB Part Libraries require FREE
       Library Loader software to convert them into your ECAD tool format.
    2. Run the Library Loader from its desktop shortcut. Library Loader
       Icon
    3. Open your ECAD tool, and the libraries will already be loaded
       automatically.
    4. When browsing Mouser's parts, simply click the component ECAD Model
       symbol from the Mouser site and drop it into your design. Once
       selected, the schematic symbols, PCB footprints and 3D models are
       immediately available for use and placement.
    5. If a part doesn't have a symbol or footprint when clicking on the
       icon to download, you can build one or request a part. To build,
       simply use the wizard from SamacSys to create both the schematic
       symbol and PCB footprint. To request a part, fill in the required
       information, including your email, and SamacSys will contact you
       once their engineering team has completed the build.
