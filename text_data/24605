Welcome to Symfony Live Paris 2012

   SensioLabs is proud to announce the "Symfony Live Paris 2012"
   conference. It will take place on June 7-9th. Some sessions will be in
   French.

   The Symfony Live Conference 2013 is a unique opportunity to meet the
   Symfony community, talk with the Symfony core team, and share your
   experience with the framework.

   In addition to the conference, SensioLabs is going to organize
   workshops on Symfony topics on June 6th and a free "hacking" day on
   June 9th.
