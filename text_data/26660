Are You Willing to Fail? An Apple Event School Visit

   “Are you willing to fail?” What if this was one of your interview
   questions when you were applying for your next job?! This was
   the  “gentle” nudge that the British International School of Houston
   stuck with when they dreamed big for the vision of their school.
   I love how Apple gives educators the ability to visit other schools
   through their Apple Events. It’s like peaking behind the curtain and
   letting your curiosity run! Seeing how this K-12 school does things
   inspires me to be the best I can be when I serve my students,
   community, and school.
   This school showed us the value of empowering students and staff
   through fostering creativity.
    1. Every learner is a creator preparing for the unknown.
    2. Teachers are designers creating conditions for their students.
    3. Environments matter-they inspire.

                                 the library

   The environment of BISH is beautiful. They invite the community onto
   their campus. Everywhere you turn there is collaborative space.
   “Neighborhoods” (their grade level hallways) are buzzing with
   problem-solving and authentic learning. And the challenge proposed by
   their leadership is: ARE YOU WILLING TO FAIL?
   Are you willing to dream so big that failure may happen? This is scary
   business! Can leadership let their staff flourish enough to trust them
   to dream big, fail, and dream again?
   How can professional development go beyond a technology meeting and
   look at digital agility in an appropriate way? How do we design PD to
   be learner-centered (not student, but teacher centered?), customized to
   the needs of each teacher? How do we as educators put culture and
   community first, and trust that all the details-the test scores, the
   data, the prep for the future, will all fall into place?
   I feel like I’m full of more questions than answers, but these are the
   questions that lead to those moments of being willing to fail. I’ll
   continue to ask the questions and challenge myself and those around me
   to lean in and do the scary things...and be willing and ready to fail.

The Healthy Blacksmith Challenge

   As a part of the Group 4 Project for the Diploma Program of our IB
   school, seniors at Westlake Academy took on the challenge of helping
   staff members make healthy choices.
   First, they created videos to invite our staff to join the challenge.

   R0x6kUKGBRrRPiXYD5nm0SJFl1RpDaMvpb6G

   Each student was partnered with a staff member to be their mentor. We
   used a Google Form to collect feedback from teachers on what their
   goals were during this time, and that guided the content we created for
   our website (find our website here)

The Syllabook

   You guys, #EveryoneCanCreate. If that's not your mantra yet, then you
   need my Syllabook Template!

   During the first days of school, every teacher hands out their syllabus
   to students and parents. Oftentimes, they are left on desks when
   students leave the class and forgotten about!
   Welcome to your #syllabook template! This multitouch book allows for
   your students and parents to engage with your class as it sets the tone
   for your learning space.
   Here's a video preview of my personal #syllabook:

   And I've made a template just for you!! You get a template, and you get
   a template, and YOU get a template! :)
   Here's the ePUB file for download of my own personal book.
   Also the template link (Open into Pages, File >> Duplicate)
   It's the easiest thing to do. Drag and drop with your favorite images,
   and copy over your text from your syllabus! I hope you enjoy! And
   please share your creations! Email them to me, tag me on Twitter
   (@mrshahn), or use the hashtag #syllabook!

Apple Distinguished Educator Institute 2018

   Where do I even begin? It's been a few years since I've been to ADE
   Institute and this one did not disappoint! When you find your tribe of
   people, cling to them... don't let go, and let their wisdom empower you
   to do amazing things!

   Not only does this community push me out of my comfort zone, but we get
   to walk into so many adventures together.

Growth and Opportunities through the Apple Distinguished Educator Program

   A few weeks ago I was given an opportunity to speak at TCEA in Austin.
   You would think speaking to other teachers is easy-I speak all day in
   front of students for a living. But man, talk about vulnerability and
   reality checks!
   I was a nervous wreck as I prepared. But there’s something about
   putting yourself in a vulnerable position that is so magical: there’s
   an opportunity to see how far you’ve come. Through all the highs and
   deep valleys I’ve been through, I’ve come a long way in my 7 years as
   an educator. This last week of pouring into other educators reminded me
   that all of the hard work I’m doing in my classroom is movement in the
   right direction. That digging in and doing things
   differently—challenging my students to make an impact on their world
   around them—getting them to not only think analytically in science but
   creatively—to be problem solvers... all of this is confirmation that
   what we do in my class is absolutely worth it.

Breakout Edu!

   Have you ever done an escape room? If not, Google that and find one to
   do with a group of friends! They are so much fun and challenging. Even
   better? Making one yourself!
   Breakout Edu is an awesome platform that turns your classroom into an
   escape room. If you purchase a kit, you will be given a set of physical
   locks, a large and small box, and few other supplies that allows you to
   build out the game. You can use the website's already made games by
   teacher around the world, or like I did, create your own. There is even
   a feature to use digital locks, so you do not have to buy a kit!

The Importance of Creating Significant Learning Environments

   It's been a few months since I have received my Master's Diploma, had a
   baby, and started back up in the classroom again. I'm exhausted, yet I
   still can't help but to hold high standards for myself in the way I
   design my learning environment. I find it important now, more than
   ever, to create significant learning environments (CSLE) for my
   students.
   Within my IB program, the Diploma Candidates that are in biology,
   chemistry, and physics are required to complete something called "The
   Group 4 Project." Many times these projects are simple research
   projects: gather information on a topic, put it on a PowerPoint
   presentation, show it to your classmates, and call it a day. B O R I N
