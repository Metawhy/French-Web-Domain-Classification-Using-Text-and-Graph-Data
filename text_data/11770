   The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the first detector of its kind,
   designed to observe the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice. An
   international group of scientists responsible for the scientific
   research makes up the IceCube Collaboration.

   Encompassing a cubic kilometer of ice, IceCube searches for nearly
   massless subatomic particles called neutrinos. These high-energy
   astronomical messengers provide information to probe the most violent
   astrophysical sources: events like exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts,
   and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes and neutron stars.

   The Antarctic neutrino observatory, which also includes the surface
   array IceTop and the dense infill array DeepCore, was designed as a
   multipurpose experiment. IceCube collaborators address several big
   questions in physics, like the nature of dark matter and the properties
   of the neutrino itself. IceCube also observes cosmic rays that interact
   with the Earth’s atmosphere, which have revealed fascinating structures
   that are not presently understood.

   Approximately 300 physicists from 50 institutions in 12 countries make
   up the IceCube Collaboration. The international team is responsible for
   the scientific program, and many of the collaborators contributed to
   the design and construction of the detector. Exciting new research
   conducted by the collaboration is opening a new window for exploring
   our universe.

   The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided the primary funding for
   the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, with assistance from partner funding
   agencies around the world. The University of Wisconsin–Madison is the
   lead institution, responsible for the maintenance and operations of the
   detector. Funding Agencies in each collaborating country support their
   scientific research efforts.

IceCube awarded the 2013 Breakthrough of the Year

   Collaboration.

   The IceCube project has been awarded the 2013 Breakthrough of the Year
   by the British magazine Physics World. The Antarctic observatory has
   been selected for making the first observation of cosmic neutrinos, but
   also for overcoming the many challenges of creating and operating a
   colossal detector deep under the ice at the South Pole.

   “The ability to detect cosmic neutrinos is a remarkable achievement
   that gives astronomers a completely new way of studying the cosmos,”
   says Hamish Johnston, editor of physicsworld.com. “The judges of the
   2013 award were also impressed with the IceCube collaboration’s ability
   to build and operate a huge and extremely sensitive detector in the
   most remote and inhospitable place on Earth.”

   The IceCube Neutrino Observatory was completed in December 2010, after
   seven years of construction at the South Pole. But the idea of a huge
   detector buried in the ice was conceived a long time ago. Back in the
   1990s, the AMANDA detector was built as a proof of concept for IceCube.
   By January 2005, the first sensors of IceCube had already reached 2,450
   meters below the Antarctic ice sheet. It was only a few weeks ago that
   the IceCube Collaboration published in Science the first evidence for a
   very high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux, opening a new era in
   astronomy.

   “I did not imagine that the science would be as exciting as building
   this detector. Challenges were many, from deciphering the optical
   properties of ice that we have never seen to drilling a hole to 2.5
   kilometers in 2 days, and then repeating 86 times. Only the dedication
   of very talented individuals made this possible,” says Francis Halzen,
   principal investigator of IceCube and the Hilldale and Gregory Breit
   Professor of Physics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

   As Prof. Halzen first envisioned, the ice became the perfect medium to
   search for very high-energy neutrinos that, after travelling through
   the universe during millions—even billions—of years, haphazardly
   interact with the nucleus of a molecule of ice.

   “The success of IceCube builds on the efforts of hundreds of
   collaborators around the world—from the design, the deployment in a
   harsh environment and the AMANDA prototype to data harvesting and
   physics analysis. The top breakthrough of the year award is a superb
   way to ultimately honor these efforts,” adds Olga Botner, IceCube
   spokesperson and physics professor at Uppsala University.

   “We made the impossible seem easy,” can be read on a wall at
   UW–Madison, quoting one of the driller technicians who helped make this
   telescope a reality. One challenge after another was overcome, and once
   the full detector was operational, the science results were even more
   incredible. The first neutrinos from outer space have been observed,
   and IceCube is honored to head the list of 2013 physics breakthroughs,
   but the best might be yet to come.

   IceCube is comprised of 5,160 digital optical modules suspended along
   86 strings (cables) embedded in a cubic kilometer of ice beneath the
   South Pole. It detects neutrinos through the tiny flashes of blue
   light, called Cherenkov light, produced when neutrinos interact in the
   ice.

   The IceCube Neutrino Observatory was built under an NSF Major Research
   Equipment and Facilities Construction grant, with assistance from
   partner funding agencies around the world. The project continues with
   support from a Maintenance and Operations grant from the NSF’s Division
   of Polar Programs and Physics Division, along with international
   support from participating institutions and their funding agencies.
   UW–Madison is the lead institution, and the international collaboration
   includes 275 physicists and engineers from the U.S., Germany, Sweden,
   Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, U.K.,
   Korea and Denmark.

NSF mid-scale award sets off the first extension of IceCube

   The National Science Foundation has approved full funding to upgrade
   the IceCube detector, extending its scientific capabilities to lower
   energies and thus enabling IceCube to reach neutrino energies that
   overlap with the energy ranges of smaller existing neutrino detectors
   worldwide.

Featured releases

   On July 12, the IceCube Collaboration together with partner telescopes
   and observatories announced the first evidence of a source of
   high-energy cosmic neutrinos. The results were presented in two papers
   published in Science. The first paper provided an analysis of the
   neutrino alert event IceCube-170922A in coincidence with
   electromagnetic observations of the blazar TXS 0506+056. The second
   paper presented an analysis of IceCube neutrino point source data in
   the direction of TXS 0506+056 prior to the alert event. Together these
   results allowed the identification of this blazar as the first likely
   source of high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays.

Data Use Policy

   IceCube is committed to the goal of releasing data to the scientific
   community. The following links contain data sets produced by
   AMANDA/IceCube researchers along with a basic description. Due to
   challenging demands on event reconstruction, background rejection and
   systematic effects, data will be released after the main analyses are
   completed and results are published by the international IceCube
   Collaboration. During the construction phase of IceCube we expect that
   final data sets can be released within a few years after the data have
   been taken.

NSF mid-scale award sets off the first extension of IceCube

   The National Science Foundation has approved full funding to upgrade
   the IceCube detector, extending its scientific capabilities to lower
   energies and thus enabling IceCube to reach neutrino energies that
   overlap with the energy ranges of smaller existing neutrino detectors
   worldwide.

IceCube looks for extremely energetic gamma rays from the Milky Way

   Something in the Milky Way galaxy may be accelerating cosmic rays to
   very high energies—as in the level of a quadrillion electronvolts,
   called a petaelectronvolt (PeV).

Dealing with dust in Antarctic ice

   Even in Antarctica, scientists have to deal with a little dust in their
   detectors.

Week 35 at the Pole

   The sky is beginning to take on different colors at the Pole, depending
   on which direction you’re looking. There’s a hazy band of orange along
   the horizon, but facing away toward the station the sky appears blue.
