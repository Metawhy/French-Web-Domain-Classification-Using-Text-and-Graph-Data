Benefit

A work zone queue warning system at the I-70/I-57 interchange reduced queuing
crashes by 14 percent and injury crashes by 11 percent.

Summary Information

   The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a work
   zone queue warning system installed to improve safety during
   reconstruction on the I-70/I-57 interchange in Effingham, Illinois. The
   system used portable dynamic message signs (DMS) mounted on solar
   powered trailers equipped with traffic detectors and cameras to monitor
   traffic conditions and warn drivers of developing queues. Using
   cellular communications, DMS trailers located 10 to 12 miles upstream
   of the work zone were integrated into a wireless command and control
   system to provide drivers with real-time information on traffic queues
   and opportunities to select alternate routes if needed.
   An evaluation was conducted to assess impacts on queues and delays, and
   end-of-queue crashes with and without the system installed. The
   construction project occurred between December 2010 and October 2012.
   The following functions and features were deployed.
     * Capability to operate automatically on a continuous (24/7) basis.
     * 25 portable dynamic message signs (DMS) capable of remote control
       via a central computer base station.
     * 25 portable traffic sensors linked to the central base stations.
     * 20 remote video cameras linked to the central base station.
     * One central base station with appropriate software and either
       wireless or dedicated phone line communications to link with the
       traffic management system components.
     * A password protected project website (with color coded map display)
       that project personnel could use to monitor conditions and check on
       operational status of the system components.

   FINDINGS
   The Illinois DOT found that with the system in place travelers
   experienced fewer crashes, including fewer end-of-queue crashes.
     * Between 2010 (prior to system implementation) and 2011 (after
       system implementation) researchers saw nearly a 14 percent decrease
       in queuing crashes, and an 11 percent reduction in injury crashes,
       despite a 52 percent increase in the number of days when temporary
       lane closures were implemented during the evaluation.

   Although it was not certain whether the queuing frequencies and
   conditions between the two years were similar, the data collected
   suggested positive benefits.

Costs From This Source

   A freeway work zone queue warning system was installed for
   approximately $1.545 million.

   Utah DOT installed 10 Bluetooth readers for $40,000 to monitor work
   zone traffic conditions during a nine month project. O&M was estimated
   at $33,000.

Lessons From This Source

   Plan adequate time to calibrate Bluetooth readers to maximize accuracy
   and reliability.

   Plan to recalibrate traffic sensors to accommodate lane shifts and
   other changes near work zones.

   Verify that proposed innovations and technologies will operate as
   advertised.
