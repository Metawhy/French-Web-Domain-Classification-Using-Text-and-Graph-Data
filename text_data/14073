&ignite Boutique

   andignite-bouqitue

   Hi Friends!

   Itâ€™s been a VERY long time since Iâ€™ve posted anything, and for that I
   apologize. Iâ€™ve been filling up my time with adventures, work and
   personal projects including &ignite Boutique.

   Besides being a graphic designer, I read and practice tarot cards, as
   well as make handmade crochet tarot bags for people to keep their tarot
   decks in. I realize the design community may not be my target audience,
   but when it comes to tarot readings, people from all walks of life are
   looking for direction and guidance at one point or another, so why not
   put it out there. This has been more of a passion project for me,
   something I genuinely enjoy doing. Helping people when I can is really
   important to me, and tarot not only gives me an outlet to do that but
   it gives people a lot of hope and direction when they feel like they
   arenâ€™t sure what to do next. I put a lot of time, energy and attention
   into each reading, I leave my judgements and projections at the door
   and try my best to give each client the very most from their reading
   experience. Curious? Want more info? Have questions? Check out my Etsy
   store, andignite Boutique or check out my alternate blog,
   and-ignite.tumblr.com
   Thank you!

   I know, I knowâ€¦ Itâ€™s been ages since my last WordPress post! But
   through all my Tumblr finds, I thought I would post the work of this
   amazing artist. Netherlands based Marjolein Caljouw uses a bit of
   coloured pencil, acrylic and digital techniques to create these
   gorgeous pieces. Check out more of her work here, and follow &inspire
   on Tumblr for more finds like this!

   Yellow Submarine is a cute organic burger shop in Zagreb, Croatia.
   Using the periscope as a main feature though out the campaign, this
   brand is definitely eye-catchingâ€¦ ha

   Ivan Dilberovic is the mastermind behind the overall brand, guerrilla
   advertising, gorgeous website and interior design. The periscope can be
   found popping up through fountains, sidewalks and parks throughout the
   city. Love!

   See more of this brand here and here!
