A Cancer Conundrum: Challenges of Living Longer

   Posted on

   June 13, 2013 by Adam P. Silverstein

   Beating cancer is awesome. What’s more awesome is that we’re seeing an
   increase in the amount of cancer patients winning their fight as we
   enter what I see as an incredibly promising period in cancer research
   and treatment.

   Those who followed the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting,
   and led conversations around it (see my colleagues Brian Reid and Greg
   Matthews work on how oncologists are getting social), are well aware of
   the inspiring work the oncology community is doing on behalf of cancer
   patients. From immunotherapy as a potential breakthrough in melanoma
   and other cancers to vinegar – yes, vinegar – for cervical cancer
   screening, cancer research will continue to decrease mortality rates
   for cancers.

   All this progress, however, creates a new and welcome challenge.
   Long-term cancer survivors (70 percent of patients now live for at
   least five years after diagnosis) and their caregivers, are about 25
   percent more likely to experience anxiety than those who don’t have
   cancer, and it can be a significant health concern ten years after
   diagnosis. Anxiety is also likely to last longer than depression.

   These findings are the result of a meta-analysis (a combination and
   compilation of several previously reported studies (27) on 500,000
   patients reporting on depression or anxiety in cancer patients)
   published last week in The Lancet Oncology.

   Anxiety is a very understandable response to surviving cancer. It’s
   easy to see why someone who’s had cancer and is grateful to be alive
   still is anxious. Imagine waking up with a pain in your side, or a sore
   throat, or a stiff back, and wondering, hoping, praying, it’s not your
   cancer returning. In the case of caregivers, I imagine the fear they
   feel each time they take their husband, wife, father, mother, sister or
   brother to a routine physical and hope that it’s just that, routine.

   This meta-analysis finds that that by 2020, the number of people
   diagnosed with cancer each year will exceed 21 million. If every person
   diagnosed with cancer has just one caregiver, we’re talking about 42
   million people each year who will be dealing with cancer’s long-term
   effects. Yet this meta-analysis shows that once a patient is discharged
   from hospital care, they receive infrequent check-ups from the medical
   teams and minimal counseling.

   As cancer care and survivorship improves, the medical system will need
   to adapt and think beyond a cancer cure to continued cancer care.
   Hospitals, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies that can
   partner together to provide this continued care will gain long-lasting
   trust from both survivors and their families. And that’s something to
   be thankful for.

   P.S. Sunday is Father’s Day. I know that men (myself included) would
   prefer to have a tooth pulled than talk about our health. But sons (and
   daughters) owe it to dad to talk about health and whether they’ve taken
   steps lately to understand their risks for cancer and take action. Oh,
   and don’t forget to thank dad for all the great advice and “Dad jokes”
   he’s probably given you over the years. I’ll certainly be thanking
   mine.
