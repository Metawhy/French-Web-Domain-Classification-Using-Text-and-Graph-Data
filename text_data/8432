Honor The Treaties

   Honor the Treaties is a short ﬁlm that examines photographer Aaron
   Hueyʼs powerful advocacy work for Native American rights on the Pine
   Ridge Reservation. The ﬁlm explores the idea that journalists often
   ʻget the story wrong.ʼ
   Using Aaronʼs seven-year experience as a photographer on the Pine Ridge
   Reservation, we examine the idea of growth and change in relationship
   to telling a story. Aaronʼs advocacy work began with his 2010 TED Talk
   calling for the return of the Black Hills to the Lakota Sioux. Viewed
   online over 800,000 times, the talk caught the attention of legendary
   street artist Shepard Fairey, who, along with artist Ernesto Yerena,
   teamed up on a nationwide poster campaign based on Aaronʼs images. In
   November 2011, Shepard and Aaron installed a sixty by eighty foot
   mural, based on a collage of Aaronʼs images, in Los Angeles.
   Aaronʼs movement into advocacy is shown in our ﬁlm through his
   collaboration with Fairey. Juxtaposing the urban environment of Los
   Angeles against the stark, rural poverty of Pine Ridge, the ﬁlm seeks
   to draw connections between art & advocacy, ultimately making a case
   for empowering individuals to ʻtell their own stories'.
