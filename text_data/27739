Poems for the Whole Year

   My kinder kids love poetry journals! They love adding poems to their
   journal and rereading their favorites! There are so many benefits to
   children reading poetry. Poetry encourages children to read, builds
   phonemic awareness and builds essential skills like rhyming,
   vocabulary, fluency, expression, and writing. I rounded up all the
   poems I use in a school year and put them all in one place.
   I love reading Jack Prelutsky to my children! These two books are
   filled with cute rhymes.

   Here are some of the poems we have added to our poetry journals!

Happy New Year!

   Ringing in the new year when the students return in January is always a
   favorite of mine. I have been making these new year kids for years.
   When something is good you just can't stop.
   [ACS_0402.jpg]
   This is one of my favorite books to read before we start writing our
   own resolutions.

   I'm sure most of them do not even remember, but it is still fun to
   graph if you stayed up until midnight. The ones that do stay up are
   always so proud of their accomplishment.

   We also surveyed our friends!

   This dot art looks good on lockers, windows, or your door.

   I updated everything for 2020! Hard to believe the new year is only a
   few months away. It will be here before you know it.

The Snowy Day book activities

   We loved bringing The Snowy Day to life with this story telling kit
   from Lakeshore. We practiced retelling the events that happened in the
   story again and again. One of my literacy stations is filled with story
   telling kits from books I have read aloud to them.
   [fullsizeoutput_10.jpeg]
   Then we made text-to-self connections about what we would do on a snowy
   day. The art project turned out so cute! Once they finished drawing
   themselves in the snow they added the snow and snowbank using their
   finger tips.
   You can download the craft here.

   [ACS_0421.jpg]
   [ACS_0422.jpg]
   I found fake snow in the Target dollar spot and thought it would be
   perfect for a  Snowy Day sensory tub. The students had to pick a
   mitten, read the word, identify the word part, and put it in the
   correct snow man. You can download the activity here.

Gingerbread Man Fun

   Teaching kindergarten in December is a lot of fun! Every year I do a
   gingerbread theme that integrates literacy, math, and science. We read
   all the versions of The Gingerbread Man and chart the story elements.
   [ACS_0392.jpg]
   We also do a fun science experiment by putting the Gingerbread Man in
   water and observing the dissolving process. You could also extend this
   experiment by putting The Gingerbread Man in other liquids like milk,
   oil, juice, soda. I wonder what would happen? Only one way to find out.
   Test it!
   You can download the recording sheet here or just click the picture
   below.

   Here are some of my favorite Gingerbread Man books to read aloud

A Day in Kindergarten: Part one

   Each day begins with morning work. Morning work can be anything that
   the students can do successfully and independently. This can be
   independent reading, playing with play-doh, morning tubs, finishing
   work from the previous afternoon, journal writing, or a quick skill
   review. We do this for 20-30 minutes.
   Example of one of our morning tubs
   [fullsizeoutput_f.jpeg]
   Then I grab my big pencil and the kiddos know it is time for
   handwriting. We have a super short mini lesson on the carpet. I use the
   big pencil to "skywrite" the letter formations we are learning.
   Following the mini lesson I set my timer for 10 minutes and start
   circulating around the room as the students work in their Handwriting
   Without Tears workbook.
   *this is an affiliate link*

   IFRAME:
   //ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&O

   how_border=false&link_opens_in_new_window=false&price_color=333333&titl
   e_color=0066c0&bg_color=ffffff

   As soon as the timer goes off it is time for Calendar math. I use Every
   Day Counts: Calendar Math.
   Up next is shared reading. We spend 10 minutes each day doing shared
   reading. This can be a big book, enlarged poem, or song. We revisit the
   same book/poem over multiple days while working on a different skill
   each time we read it.
   After a little brain break we move right into reading workshop. I use
   the units of study by Lucy Calkins. The units of study can be a little
   overwhelming if you don't know how to unpack the units. I  unpacked the
   first two reading units. You should be able to plan a ten minute mini
   lesson on a single sticky note. When you are ready to teach the mini
   lesson all you need to take with you is the post-it note. I summarized
   each mini lesson for Super Powers unit 2 on a single post-it note. You
   can grab the unit here or by clicking one of the pictures below. This
   is how I organized my unit using a 1-inch view binder. I put everything
   I would need to teach each session into a pocket sleeve. It makes me
   feel organized and makes teaching the units of study so easy.

Classroom Newsletter

   Effective communication between parents and teachers is key to student
   success. For me the best way to keep parents informed is to send home a
   weekly class newsletter. A newsletter helps parents keep track of
   upcoming school activities and what kids are learning in school. I like
   to send home a hard copy in take home folders and email a copy to
   parents. I include a little peek at our week, upcoming dates, the high
   frequency words we will be learning, important reminders, and our daily
   specials schedule.
   [august%2Bexample.jpg]
   [may%2Bexample.jpg]
   If you need help creating a newsletter for your class I made my
   newsletter editable. Click here or the picture above for the newsletter
   template.
