Empowering Women Who Are Rebuilding Their Lives

THE ISSUE

     * 1 in 4 women is a victim of domestic violence
     * 3 in 4 homeless women are victims of DV
     * DV victims lose a total of 8 million days of paid work each year
     * 15 million children witness DV each year
     * Many women have lost everything and start over with nothing,
       except…

   shame fear worthlessness hopelessness
   But, there is hope.

We believe all women should be able to live abuse-free, in healthy
relationships, empowered to reach their greatest potential.

OUR STORY

   Founder and visionary Dana Bristol-Smith, who discovered that her
   corporate Public Speaking and Leadership training had life-changing
   impact for professional women, woke one night with an idea and wrote
   the curriculum that became the backbone of our programs.

   After learning of the huge unmet need for domestic violence victims to
   build their self-confidence to avoid returning to abusive partners,
   Bristol-Smith gathered experts—therapists, coaches, and trainers—to
   create a leadership program which she initially launched as a volunteer
   project with 6 participants.

   These women have subsequently taken their message out to the community
   and have spoken to over 7,000 others in homeless shelters, schools, and
   other organizations.

     * poverty and homelessness
     * violence at home and in our neighborhoods
     * risk of violent behavior by children in adulthood
     * costs to taxpayers for medical care, law enforcement, and lost
       wages…

   …to ultimately create healthier, safer communities.

Hope for a Better Tomorrow in East County

   By Dana Bristol-Smith With tears in her eyes, she said, "I just want to
   say thank you. I know that I was meant to be here. I know that we are
   all meant to be here." Those were the words of one of the women who
   came to our very first class in El Cajon. Her gratitude was felt by
   all. I'm always excited on the first day of class because I know what's
   in store for the women. And, it's very … [Read More...]
