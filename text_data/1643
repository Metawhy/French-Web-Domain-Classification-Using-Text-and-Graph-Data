BLOCK TRACKERS

   Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and
   ads can't follow you. Any cookies automatically clear when you're done
   browsing. So will your browsing history.
   Defend Against Surveillance

DEFEND AGAINST SURVEILLANCE

   Tor Browser prevents someone watching your connection from knowing what
   websites you visit. All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see
   is that you're using Tor.
   Resist Fingerprinting

RESIST FINGERPRINTING

   Tor Browser aims to make all users look the same making it difficult
   for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device
   information.
   Multi-layered Encryption

MULTI-LAYERED ENCRYPTION

   Your traffic is relayed and encrypted three times as it passes over the
   Tor network. The network is comprised of thousands of volunteer-run
   servers known as Tor relays.
