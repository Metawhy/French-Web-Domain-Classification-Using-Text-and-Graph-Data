ADYOULIKE'S "NATIVE ADVERTISING ", WHAT IS IT?

// Native Advertising

   ADYOULIKE specializes in the diffusion (creation, programming) of
   native advertising respecting your user journey. You consume the
   content that you have come to look for before viewing the advertisement
   (remuneration source of the publisher sites) that is integrated in your
   navigation or in the contextual flow of the publisher site. Thus by the
   view of the advertisement, you allow the publisher site to be paid and
   to continue to present you with quality content.

   As part of its Native Advertising services, ADYOULIKE collects, as a
   subcontractor, on behalf of its customers, your browsing data via
   Cookies posted on advertising sites or the websites of its advertising
   partners.

WHY DO WE TARGET YOU?

// Target

   Our goal is to provide personalized, contextualized, targeted
   advertising based on the data collected and your recent browsing
   behavior while respecting your anonymity. Advertising is an integral
   part of your navigation, allowing you to discover advertising offers,
   products, videos, images, websites, like any other web content.

CONSENT OF THE USER

   When consulting the ADYOULIKE website or the websites of its
   advertising partners, an information banner on these sites informs you
   of the deposit of advertising cookies and asks you to consent to them.
   However, if you want ADYOULIKE to no longer drop an advertising cookie
   on the browser you are currently using, you can disable them here. This
   will prevent ADYOULIKE from collecting anonymous data but will not
   interrupt the ad serving.
