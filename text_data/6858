                                January 2018


    1. General Terms and Conditions
         1. The Fans of M.O. Programme (the “Programme”) is operated and
            administered by Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited and its
            affiliates (collectively, “MOHG”). The Programme will provide
            guests of MOHG-managed hotels that are participating in the
            Fans of M.O. Programme (“MO Hotels”) the opportunity to
            receive certain benefits from MO Hotels from time to time. The
            terms and conditions applicable to the Programme are set out
            in these “Terms and Conditions”.
         2. Members acknowledge and agree that their participation in the
            Programme is subject to and contingent on Member’s acceptance
            of the MOHG Privacy Policy found at:
            www.mandarinoriental.com/privacy-policy, Ad and Cookie Policy
            found at: www.mandarinoriental.com/cookie-policy, and Legal
            Notices found at: www.mandarinoriental.com/legal-notices.
            These policies and notices are deemed to be incorporated into
            these Terms and Conditions.
         3. Membership to the Programme will only be granted to individual
            persons. MOHG may grant or deny membership in the Programme in
            MOHG’s sole discretion, without the need for any reason or
            explanation. Individuals must be at least 18 years of age or
            have reached the age of majority, if older under applicable
            local laws. It is a Member’s sole and exclusive responsibility
            to ensure that they comply with these age requirements.
            Corporations and/or organizations are not eligible to enrol in
            the Programme.
         4. Individuals who apply for and are granted membership in the
            Programme (“Member” or “Members”) are eligible for Programme
            benefits when they stay at a MO Hotel as a paying guest and
            for exclusive Member-only access and offers (collectively
            “Benefits”). All Members acknowledge and agree that they must
            satisfy the age requirements specified above in order to
            legitimately benefit from membership in the Programme.
         5. Membership in the Programme is free, has no cash value and is
            not commissionable. No purchase is required to apply for
            membership in the Programme.
         6. Enrolment in the Programme can be made online at
            www.mandarinoriental.com/fans-of-mo (“Programme Gateway”). By
            enrolling and / or participating in the Programme, Members
            agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions. To enrol in the
            Programme, guests must provide their first and last names as
            well as a valid email address and a password. Upon successful
            enrolment, Members will be assigned an individual Member ID.
         7. MOHG reserves the right to amend or modify the Programme,
            Programme structure and/or these Terms and Conditions at its
            sole discretion at any time, with or without notice. Programme
            modifications may include changes to Benefits, redemption
            requirements and the features of special offers. A Member’s
            continued use of the Programme will constitute acceptance of
            the amendments and modifications.
         8. For specific Programme questions, please direct all
            communications to Member Services at: FansOfMO@mohg.com.
         9. MOHG may immediately suspend or terminate a Member’s
            membership in the Programme at any time without notice and/or
            for any reason, and in MOHG’s sole discretion; including
            without limitation, if MOHG suspects (even if not proven) the
            Member has breached or violated these Terms and Conditions,
            engaged in misuse or wrongdoing in connection with the
            Programme, acted in a fraudulent, inappropriate, hostile or
            abusive manner, failed to pay any amount due to MOHG or any MO
            Hotel, acted in a manner inconsistent with any applicable law,
            regulation, rule or ordinance, or resides in or relocates to a
            country where membership is prohibited under applicable law.
            Such termination will result in an automatic forfeiture of any
            Benefits and Member will no longer be able to participate in
            the Programme (a record of such termination will be retained
            on MOHG’s records). Nothing contained in these Terms and
            Conditions shall limit MOHG in the exercise of its legal or
            equitable rights or remedies.
        10. Members acknowledge and agree that MOHG reserves the sole and
            exclusive right to the interpretation of these Terms and
            Conditions. In the event of any dispute with Members, the
            determination of MOHG of the dispute will be final, without
            right of further appeal.
        11. Some MOHG-managed hotels will not be participating in the Fans
            of M.O. Programme and therefore will not provide the Benefits
            to Members. As at 13 August, 2018 the MOHG-managed hotels that
            are not participating in the Fans of M.O. Programme are as
            follows: Hotel Santiago.
    2. Programme Membership
         1. Membership in the Programme is free and available to
            individuals residing in countries that legally permit
            participation in such programmes. Participation in the
            Programme indicates acceptance of these Terms and Conditions
            as well as any changes or modifications made to them by MOHG
            from time to time.
         2. No Member may transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of their
            Programme membership to a third party.
         3. By enrolling in the Programme, consent is given to MOHG to
            collect and use Member’s personal information in connection
            with the Programme. By providing contact information, Members
            agree to receive marketing communications, including offers
            and promotional messages, from MOHG and MO Hotels.
         4. MOHG is not responsible for communication errors resulting
            from a change to Member’s email address or contact
            information. Any change to Member’s email address should be
            made to Member Services. Members can log into their online
            account on the Programme Gateway.
         5. Members are solely responsible for ensuring that access to
            their online membership in the Programme is protected using a
            confidential and strong/secure password, and such password
            must not be disclosed to any other party. MOHG cannot be held
            liable for the consequences of any unauthorized access to a
            Member’s account.
         6. Providing fictitious, incorrect or false information may
            result in termination of your Programme membership and
            forfeiture of all Benefits.
         7. An individual is not permitted to have more than one
            Membership. In the event more than one account number is
            assigned to the same individual, the duplicate account may be
            cancelled by MOHG, and only the Benefits, excluding any
            welcome Benefits, will be transferred to the remaining account
            as determined by MOHG in its discretion.
         8. Membership may be cancelled by a Member at any time by
            notifying Member Services by email. Cancellation may take up
            to two (2) weeks to finalize. Upon cancellation, membership
            will be deactivated and any offers or unused Benefits will be
            forfeited.
         9. Any Membership that has been inactive for a period of not less
            than five years may be terminated by MOHG, in its sole
            discretion, with any unused Benefits being forfeited.
            Membership will also automatically terminate upon the death of
            the Member, with any unused Benefits being forfeited.

    3. Data Privacy and Membership Communications
         1. Member accepts and explicitly agrees that personal information
            which is supplied by or on behalf of Member when enrolling for
            membership in the Programme and/or supplied to and/or obtained
            by MOHG during the course of the Member’s membership in the
            Programme, will be processed by MOHG in accordance with the
            MOHG Privacy Policy (found at:
            www.mandarinoriental.com/privacy-policy). In particular, but
            without limitation, MOHG processes Members’ personal
            information as follows:
               o MOHG will collect, retain and process Members’ names,
                 contact details, demographics, preferences (including
                 food allergies, medical conditions and other sensitive
                 data) and transaction data (collectively, “PII”) from the
                 information Members provide MOHG and the MO Hotels, and
                 from personal interactions Members have with service
                 staff at properties managed by MOHG, in order for MOHG to
                 inform Members of and/or provide Members with the
                 services MOHG thinks Members may be interested in or that
                 Members may request from MOHG and/or the MO Hotels from
                 time to time.
               o Members’ PII will be shared with MOHG’s global network of
                 companies and the service providers that assist MOHG with
                 administering Members’ PII (collectively, “MO Hotel
                 Network”). Accordingly, a Member’s PII may be transferred
                 to, processed in and stored at a country outside a
                 Member’s country of residence (including outside the EEA,
                 if the Member is an EEA resident).
               o The MO Hotel Network will contact Members by letter,
                 email, phone, text and/or fax to inform Members of news
                 and promotions regarding hotels, travel, food & beverage,
                 spa, conferencing, fashion and real estate products and
                 services that are related to or associated with the
                 Programme and/or MO Hotels.
         2. Members may opt-out of receiving communications under the
            Programme by updating their online Member profile via the
            Programme Gateway or by directly notifying Member Services.
            Any other methods of opting-out will not be valid or
            acceptable unless otherwise agreed to in writing by MOHG.
            However, in exercising such opt-out, the Member’s membership
            in the Programme may be terminated by MOHG and/or Member’s
            access to Benefits may be limited, terminated or otherwise
            restricted as a result.

         3. Programme communications will be sent to the Member’s mailing
            address, email address, phone number or such other contact
            details as provided in the Member’s account. Members are
            solely responsible for keeping their email, phone numbers,
            mailing addresses and other contact details current, and for
            keeping all such contact details secure against unauthorized
            access.

         4. Members may change personal details held by MOHG at any time
            by accessing their Programme membership account via the
            Programme Gateway. MOHG may require Members to send supporting
            documentation satisfactory to MOHG, prior to allowing certain
            changes to Members personal details (e.g., legal name
            changes).

         5. MOHG may disclose details of Members’ membership in the
            Programme to the extent required by applicable laws and
            regulations, or as may be required by court order.

    4. Programme Benefits
         1. Members acknowledge and agree that, with respect to Members’
            use and enjoyment of Benefits at a MO Hotel: (a) the actual
            use and enjoyment of Benefits by a Member is not provided by
            MOHG itself but by the MO Hotel at which the Member elects to
            use or enjoy the Benefits; (b) MOHG utilises the Programme to
            facilitate communications between the Members and the MO
            Hotels, so the Members can obtain the Benefits direct from the
            MO Hotels; (c) any claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
            of any kind or nature arising from, relating to or associated
            with the Member’s use or enjoyment of the Benefits at a MO
            Hotel will be brought by the Member exclusively against that
            MO Hotel only, and will be subject to the Member’s contract
            with that MO Hotel (whether express or implied) for the
            provision of the Benefits to the Member (“Local Contract”);
            and (d) the Local Contract will be governed by the local laws
            and venue applicable to that MO Hotel supplying the Benefits
            to the Member.

         2. A list of the currently available Benefits can be found at
            www.mandarinoriental.com/fans-of-mo/terms-conditions/benefits.
            Such Benefits may be changed, substituted or deleted by MOHG
            from time to time at MOHG’s discretion and are subject to
            availability.

         3. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms and Conditions,
            Benefits made available to Members are void if a Member sells,
            barters, auctions, donates, assigns, conveys, or otherwise
            transfers them (or makes any attempt to do so) in a manner not
            expressly allowed by these Terms and Conditions or otherwise
            permitted by MOHG (in writing) in its sole discretion.

         4. Benefits are subject to all applicable laws, rules,
            regulations, ordinances and may be subject to applicable taxes
            and fees. All taxes and fees are the sole responsibility of
            the Member.

         5. Members will only be entitled to receive the Benefits if they
            have clearly identified themselves to the MO Hotel front desk
            staff at check-in and provided their Membership ID number.

         6. Some Benefits may not be available at all MO Hotel locations.

         7. Unless otherwise stated, the Benefits cannot be used in
            conjunction with any other promotions or discounts.

         8. If the Benefit provided by a MO Hotel includes the provision
            of internet access at the MO Hotel, then the Member will be
            subject to the High Speed Internet Access Terms and Conditions
            of Use as attached to the end of these Terms and Conditions.

    5. Indemnification and Liability
         1. Members hereby agree to waive and release, indemnify, hold
            harmless, and forever discharge, and covenant not to sue MOHG,
            its shareholders, employees, agents or contractors
            (collectively “Indemnified Parties”) for any and all claims,
            damages, liabilities and expenses of any kind or nature
            arising from, relating to or associated with the Member’s
            Membership under the Programme and/or Member’s use or
            enjoyment of the Benefits.
         2. In the event Member has any complaint, dissatisfaction, claim
            or other issue of any kind or nature arising from, relating to
            or associated with the Member’s Membership under the Programme
            and/or Member’s use or enjoyment of the Benefits, Member’s
            sole and exclusive remedy against MOHG will be termination of
            its membership in the Programme.
         3. IN NO EVENT WILL THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY
            DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT,
            TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHICH ARISE OUT OF OR ARE IN ANY WAY
            CONNECTED WITH THE PROGRAMME OR THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

    6. Other Terms
         1. No Warranties or Representations, Express or Implied. MOHG
            makes no warranties or representations, either expressed or
            implied with respect to type, quality or fitness of goods or
            services provided through the Programme or by MO Hotels.
         2. Not Responsible for Acts, Errors, or Omissions. MOHG is not
            responsible for: (a) any loss or misdirection of, or delay in
            receiving, any Member application, correspondence, redemption
            requests, or Benefits; (b) theft or unauthorized redemption of
            Benefits; (c) any acts or omissions of third parties
            (including, without limitation, MO Hotels); or (d) any errors
            published in relation to the Programme, including, without
            limitation, any pricing or typographical errors, errors of
            description, errors regarding MO Hotels, and errors in the
            awarding of Benefits to Members. MOHG reserves the right to
            correct, without notice, any errors.
         3. Prevailing Language. In the event of any discrepancy between
            the English version and any translated version of these Terms
            and Conditions, the English language version will prevail.
         4. Waiver. MOHG’s waiver of any breach of these Terms and
            Conditions by any Member will not constitute a waiver of any
            other prior or subsequent breach of these Terms and
            Conditions. MOHG’s failure to insist upon strict compliance
            with these Terms and Conditions by any Member will not be
            deemed a waiver of any rights or remedies that MOHG may have
            against that, or any other, Member. MOHG may waive compliance
            with these Terms and Conditions in its sole discretion and may
            run promotions from time to time that provide enhanced
            benefits to select Members.
         5. Severability. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions
            is declared invalid by order, decree or judgment of a court of
            competent jurisdiction, these Terms and Conditions must be
            construed as if such provision had not been inserted herein,
            and such invalidity will not affect the other provisions of
            these Terms and Conditions. All provisions not affected by
            such invalidity will remain in full force and effect.
         6. Governing Law. Membership in the Programme and any complaint,
            dissatisfaction, claim or other issue raised against MOHG in
            relation to or associated with the Programme will be subject
            to the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
         7. Dispute Resolution. Members agree that all disputes,
            controversies or claims arising out of or relating to these
            Terms and Conditions and/or the Member’s membership in the
            Programme, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof,
            must be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Hong
            Kong International Arbitration Centre Arbitration Rules. The
            place of arbitration will be Hong Kong. There will be one
            arbitrator and the language to be used at the arbitral
            proceedings will be English only.
         8. Entire Agreement. These Terms and Conditions, together with
            those incorporated herein or referred to herein constitute the
            entire agreement between MOHG and Members relating to the
            subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior understandings
            or agreements (whether oral or written) regarding the subject
            matter, and may not be amended or modified except as agreed in
            writing, or as may be unilaterally amended or modified by MOHG
            in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

   You are expected to use the Internet with respect, courtesy, and
   responsibility, giving due regard to the rights of other Internet
   users. We expect you to have a basic knowledge of how the Internet
   functions, the types of uses that are generally acceptable, and the
   types of uses that must be avoided. Common sense is the best guide as
   to what is considered acceptable use.  By using the Services, you agree
   to comply with these Terms of Use. Do not use the Services if you do
   not agree with these Terms of Use. The Services are supplied to you by
   the applicable MO Hotel providing you the high speed internet

   Failure to observe the guidelines set forth in these Terms of Use can
   result in anything from a warning to a suspension of privileges or
   termination of your access to the Services.  Decisions of Providers'
   staff are final.  Providers may refer potential violations of laws to
   the proper authorities, may cooperate in the investigation of any
   suspected criminal or civil wrong, and will cooperate with authorities
   when required to do so by law, subpoena, or when the public safety is
   at stake.

   By using this Service, you are using the Internet at your own risk.
   Providers are not responsible for any Internet content you view, or
   transactions or data transmissions you undertake using the Services.

   material that is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade
   secret, any other type of intellectual property rights, trademark laws
   (by rights of privacy or publicity) or other proprietary right of any
   party unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all
   necessary consents to do the same.  This prohibition includes the use
   of any material or information including images or photographs that are
   made available through the Services.

   Internet Relay Chat and Chat Room Postings and Abuse

   Although the Providers do not offer software or technical support for
   Internet Relay Chat (IRC), you may use the Services to connect to IRC
   servers and networks maintained by third parties.  Please remember that
   you are a guest when you make use of these facilities.  It is
   particularly important that you do not engage in activities that might
   interfere with other customers’ access to IRC.

   You shall not use IRC scripts or programs that interfere with or deny
   service to other users on any other server, host, network, or channel.

   You shall not engage in activities that harass other users.  This
   includes, but is not limited to, flooding (rapidly entering text with
   the intent to disrupt service), flashing (disrupting terminal
   emulation), takeovers (improper seizing and abuse of operator
   privileges), attempting to send private messages to those who do not
   wish to receive them, attempting to return to a channel after being
   banned from it, and other disruptive behaviors.

   You shall not attempt to impersonate other users.  The use of nicknames
   does not necessarily constitute impersonation.

   You shall not run clones (multiple, simultaneous IRC connections)
   and/or robots.

   You are also prohibited from abusing chat rooms.  Such abuse includes,
   but is not limited to, scrolling (repeatedly entering either
   meaningless characters, three or more repeated blank lines, the same
   text three or more times, or consistently repeating text in a Chat
   room).

   Internet Web-sites, Newsgroups and Usenet Postings and Abuse

   The Services give you access to millions of Internet web-sites,
   newsgroups and Usenet groups (Discussion Groups). These Discussion
   Groups allow you to read and post articles on a variety of topics.
   Discussion Groups may be moderated or unmoderated. Discussion Groups
   may also have a charter that describes what posts are appropriate.

   Posting commercial messages to a Discussion Group is a violation
   of these Terms of Use unless that specific Discussion Group has invited
   commercial postings in its charter. If you are unable to find a
   Discussion Group's charter, or the charter does not address commercial
   posts, you must assume that commercial posting to that Discussion Group
   is not welcome.

   Posting off-topic articles or articles that are not related to that
   Discussion Group's subject matter as defined in the Discussion Group's
   charter are also not welcomed. Cross-posting identical postings to over
   five Discussion Groups, posting for the purpose of threatening,
   harassing or intimidating Discussion Group users and forging Discussion
   Group post header information are also prohibited activities.

   The Providers do not censor or control content posted to a Discussion
   Group. As a user of the Services, you are solely responsible for the
   content that you publish. Upon notification that certain postings
   violate this policy, the law, or infringe on a trademark or copyrights
   of another, the Providers may, at their discretion, remove offending
   posts from its news server.

   The Providers reserve the right not to accept postings from Discussion
   Groups where we have actual knowledge that the content of the
   Discussion Group violates these Terms of Use.

       governmental request; (2) enforce applicable terms of service,
       including investigation of potential violations; (3) detect,

   purchasing our goods and services, we may transfer your personal
   information across multiple jurisdictions. Accordingly, insofar as
   reasonably necessary for the purposes, and on the legal basis, set out

       America, where our corporate offices are located;

       time.

   Such transfers may be to a country which may not provide the same level
   of privacy protection as that provided by the country in which the
   information was collected but we will take reasonable steps (including
   entering into data transfer agreements based on the European Commission
   model clauses, or requiring compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield)
   to ensure that while your personal information is within our control,
   we will handle your personal information using reasonable security and
   confidentiality procedures to keep your personal information secure and
   confidential.

66. HOW SECURE IS YOUR INFORMATION?

Ad and Cookie Policy

WE USE COMMON TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

   We collect personal information about users over time and across
   different websites when you use our website or service. We also have
   third parties – as described below – that collect personal information
   this way. To do this, we use several tracking tools. Our vendors may
   also use these tools. These may include browser cookies and device IDs.
   We may also use web beacons, flash cookies, and similar technologies.

WE USE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

   We use tracking tools, including cookies, on our websites. Cookies are
   small files that download when you access certain websites. To learn
   more, visit www.allaboutcookies.org or www.youronlinechoices.eu. These
   pages also explain how you can manage and delete cookies. We use
   tracking tools:
     * To recognise new or past customers.
     * To store your password if you are registered on our site.
     * To improve our website.
     * To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising (see below
       for more on interest-based advertising) as permitted by law.
     * To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across
       multiple websites or other platforms as permitted by law.
     * To better understand the interests of our customers and our website
       visitors.

WE ENGAGE IN INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING

   We and our partners display interest-based advertising using
   information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or
   other platforms. This might include apps. Interest-based advertising or
   “online behavioral advertising” includes ads served to you after you
   leave our website, encourageing you to return. They also include ads we
   think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities.
   These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also be
   served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve
   ads. They might be about our products or other companies’ products.
   Where legally required we get consent to engage in interest-based
   advertising.

HOW DO WE GATHER RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU FOR INTEREST-BASED
ADVERTISING?

   To decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make
   available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other
   third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools
   described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your
   purchases or browsing behaviors. We might look at these activities on
   our platforms or the platforms of others. As described above, we work
   with third parties who help gather this information. These third
   parties might link your name or email address to other information they
   collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or,
   it might include online usage information.

YOU CAN CONTROL MANY OF OUR TRACKING TOOLS

   Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so
   depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject
   browser cookies. To find out more about how to enable, disable, or
   delete cookies from your web browser, please
   visit www.allaboutcookies.org and www.adobe.com/devnet/security.html.
   To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from
   time to time, you can
   go www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/setting
   s_manager07.html. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled
   through your browser settings.

   Our Do Not Track Policy: Some websites have “do not track” features
   that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are
   not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you
   block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block
   or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.

   Options you select are browser and device specific.

YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING

   The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising programme
   provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online
   behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt out of
   having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes, click
   here. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
