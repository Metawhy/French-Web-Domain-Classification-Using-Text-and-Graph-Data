Hi there! We’re Katie and Eric, the faces behind Mountain Modern Life, where
we share our passion for creating a home you love, regardless of square feet.

We’re currently traveling the US in our tiny home on wheels and our goal is
to help inspire YOU to create the environment you’ve always wanted, whether
that’s through design, a certain lifestyle, or a combination of both.

Here you’ll find rustic modern design, DIY projects, tiny home hacks, along
with RV tours, renovation tips, and inspiration.
