Help Us Give

   This is something I've been thinking of for a while....I want to give
   back.  I want to give to someone in need, someone who wants beautiful
   photos but for some reason hasn't been able to do this for themselves
   and their family.  Then I got on the computer today and saw it was
   'Giving Tuesday' and I knew this was my sign...I needed to do this.  As
   we move from the season of gratitude to the season of giving, I want to
   give and I want to give to someone who really wants or needs it.
   However, I don't want to do this in a traditional way.  No popularity
   contests, no 'I need this so much because...', I want this to be a
   giveaway that will help us give- to each other.
   So here we go.
   What are we giving? A full session along with a disc of full resolution
   digital images.
   Who is the session for? Families, engagements, high school seniors,
   children, couples, models, newlyweds, best friends…anyone (This does
   not include weddings, sorry).
   How is one to win the session? This is where you come in, internet
   friends. If you know of someone in serious need or want of a photo
   shoot and think this would be the perfect Christmas gift for them,
   please email me your story/reason as to why you want to “nominate” them
   (ambersmodernphoto@gmail.com). Your reason can, but does not have to be
   a financial reason…it could be any reason as to why you feel your
   friends/family/coworker/neighbor deserves it.
   Anddddd, the fine print…
   We will review all entries and the winner will be chosen on December
   19th.
   By writing in, please know that if your story/reason is chosen as a
   finalist or winner, it may appear on my blog (names will not be used).
   You can not write in and nominate yourself, sorry!
   Session is to be used sometime before August 31, 2016.

   If you live outside of the Gila Valley, you must be willing to travel
   here for your session to take place.

Breanne & Derek- Springerville, Eager, Apache County, Arizona, Wedding
Photographer

   Breanne and Derek were married and had their reception at The Ranch at
   South Fork and X Diamond Rach in Eager , Arizona.  The location was
   BEAUTIFUL and there were so many tiny details that made this wedding
   outstanding not only to attend, but to photograph.  We spent an amazing
   day with these two and their family and friends and had a blast
   capturing their day for them to remember always.  I warn you, I
   couldn't decide what to post because there were so many great pictures,
   so this post is LONG.  I hope you enjoy it :)  Thanks again, Derek and
   Breanne.
