               o About SD Association
                 Founded in January 2000 by Panasonic, SanDisk and
                 Toshiba, the SD Association is a group dedicated to
                 establishing SD standards and facilitating their adoption
                 and development.
                 At its outset the Association represented just 14 member
                 companies and has grown into a global alliance comprised
                 of around 1,000 member companies. By developing and
                 adopting SD standards, members enjoy better compatibility
                 of member cards between devices, greatly enhancing
                 consumer enjoyment and convenience.

                 The SD Association has prepared multiple SD standards
                 relating to such features as memory capacity and
                 reading/writing speed in order for users to select the
                 optimum card for their device.

SD Speed Class/UHS Speed Class/Video Speed Class

Greater Performance Choices

   There are three kinds of Speed Classes, "Speed Class", "UHS Speed
   Class" and "Video Speed Class."

   As a characteristic of flash memory, actual transfer speed varies.
   Variable speeds are difficult to reliably record streaming content such
   as video because it requires a constant writing speed. All Speed
   Classes provide the constant speed necessary for video recording by
   designating a minimum writing performance so that minimum and constant
   speed could be achieved for camcorders, video recorders and other
   devices with video recording capabilities under the conditional write
   operation specified in the standard.
