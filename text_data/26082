Wedding Planning & The Finer Details

   I'll be honest, at the beginning of wedding planning- everything feels
   like a priority. I couldn't imagine a day without amazing food,
   flowers, great music, all of the little details, ribbons wrapped in
   Disney-esque bows around napkins and small dogs carrying flowers down
   the aisle (not really, but you get my point)...

And the bride wore pink! Choosing The Dress…

   I know it’s probably not cool to admit to having a wedding Pinterest
   board years before an engagement (it can all feel a bit Fatal
   Attraction can’t it?), but one thing I thought I had an idea about
   before I did get engaged was the kind of dress I’d want to wear one
   day- and actually, looking back I wasn’t too far off what I ended up
   going with, which, looking back- is quite cool...

The Big Day

   It’s hard to write a blog post summarising our wedding day in a page.
   There was so much excitement, love, and happiness in the build up, and

   down articulately in a post...

Wedding Month on What Olivia Did…

   Can you believe it’s been over three months since our wedding day?
   (Probably) three months since I last panic-looked at a spread sheet
   (‘THIS WEEK WE’RE DUE TO BAKE CAKES! HOW DID IT COME AROUND SO SOON!’)
   , Worried about wrong addresses and debated the Pimm’s/vs, gin
   cocktails with people, unlike me, who had in fact tried both (Pimm’s
   won, obviously- and AREN’T I GLAD IT DID)…

A Night At Bridge Place

   It’s not often that Joe and I get to travel together, so when Joe

   opportunity to be a plus one for an evening with a gorgeous brand at a
   pretty exceptional spot too...

Back to St. Ives

   Without a doubt, one of my favourite places to go to is the Cornish
   seaside. There’s something about the train journey down- riding
   alongside the coastline, head leaning against the windows, with a
   steaming cup of tea in hand; that instantly makes my shoulders drop
   from beside my ears. A sudden wash of relaxation can wash over me- and
   suddenly the trivial mundanities of the everyday feel so very far away
   (or five hours away on a train, at least).

My Favourite Books This Year (So Far) & In Defence of Chic Lit

   Since having a bit of pool time last month, I finally got my reading
   groove back on. After always somewhat getting off to a competitive
   start in January (where I tackle half a book in a week and then tail
   off)- reading becomes somewhat of a fierce sport to partake in, and
   then leaves me feeling left for dust as soon as February rolls around.

     * A new post has just gone up, talking about wedding planning and the
       finer details on the big day. Weddings have the power to give you
       an incredible eye for detail, and also irrationalise the things
       that truly mean something to you- when suddenly everything becomes
       A HUGE PRIORITY and you can end up panicking about the colour of
       linen (“IS PEACH WHITE NOT THE SAME AS OFF WHITE??”) and seat pad
       covers, which you’d never even thought about in the first place.
       Remembering why it is you’re doing this, what *actually* is
       important and that people may well not even remember to pick up
       their favours at the end either are all worth keeping in mind- but
       if you want some extra details (including our order of service and
       a few lil tips) I’ve popped a link in my bio and stories too ✨ 📷:

       things wedding dress and dress shopping- so if you’re currently on
       the 👀 out hopefully this might shed some light on the process and
       what to keep and mind (and what is definitely not worth worrying
       about too). It can be an exciting, overwhelming time- so hopefully
       this might reassure you if you’re feeling that it’s all a bit much

     * Happy Saturday folks ✨ thank you for all of the loveliness on our
       wedding video. The comments alone are enough to make me do a
       dads-speech-weep all over again so thank you, thank you. I also
       wanted to say a little (huge) thank you to all of our brilliant
       suppliers on the day, who made it everything we wished it would be.
       We were so, so lucky with how everything came together and cannot
       recommend then all enough. There’s more in the blog post that’s up

       latest wedding post, but I thought I’d share it here too. Thank you
       @papertwinwed (and @thecurries.co) for capturing the most magical
       day. (Papertwin generously offered their services to us
       complimentary, but I can not recommend them enough- eye wateringly
       brilliant in more ways than one)

       bare foot dancing, and our favourite friend, Colin) ⭐️ (P.S you can

Wedding Planning & The Finer Details

   I'll be honest, at the beginning of wedding planning- everything feels
   like a priority. I couldn't imagine a day without amazing food,
   flowers, great music, all of the little details, ribbons wrapped in
   Disney-esque bows around napkins and small dogs carrying flowers down
   the aisle (not really, but you get my point)...

And the bride wore pink! Choosing The Dress…

   I know it’s probably not cool to admit to having a wedding Pinterest
   board years before an engagement (it can all feel a bit Fatal
   Attraction can’t it?), but one thing I thought I had an idea about
   before I did get engaged was the kind of dress I’d want to wear one
   day- and actually, looking back I wasn’t too far off what I ended up
   going with, which, looking back- is quite cool...

The Big Day

   It’s hard to write a blog post summarising our wedding day in a page.

   , Worried about wrong addresses and debated the Pimm’s/vs, gin
   cocktails with people, unlike me, who had in fact tried both (Pimm’s
   won, obviously- and AREN’T I GLAD IT DID)…

A Night At Bridge Place

   It’s not often that Joe and I get to travel together, so when Joe

Back to St. Ives

   Without a doubt, one of my favourite places to go to is the Cornish
   seaside. There’s something about the train journey down- riding
   alongside the coastline, head leaning against the windows, with a
   steaming cup of tea in hand; that instantly makes my shoulders drop
   from beside my ears. A sudden wash of relaxation can wash over me- and
   suddenly the trivial mundanities of the everyday feel so very far away
   (or five hours away on a train, at least).

My Favourite Books This Year (So Far) & In Defence of Chic Lit

   Since having a bit of pool time last month, I finally got my reading
   groove back on. After always somewhat getting off to a competitive
   start in January (where I tackle half a book in a week and then tail
   off)- reading becomes somewhat of a fierce sport to partake in, and
   then leaves me feeling left for dust as soon as February rolls around.

     * A new post has just gone up, talking about wedding planning and the
       finer details on the big day. Weddings have the power to give you
       an incredible eye for detail, and also irrationalise the things
       that truly mean something to you- when suddenly everything becomes
       A HUGE PRIORITY and you can end up panicking about the colour of
       linen (“IS PEACH WHITE NOT THE SAME AS OFF WHITE??”) and seat pad
       covers, which you’d never even thought about in the first place.
       Remembering why it is you’re doing this, what *actually* is
       important and that people may well not even remember to pick up
       their favours at the end either are all worth keeping in mind- but
       if you want some extra details (including our order of service and
       a few lil tips) I’ve popped a link in my bio and stories too ✨ 📷:
       @thecurries.co
     * AD | Autumn outfits coming in courtesy of one too many watches of
       Blinded By The Light and one too many listens of My Sweet Lord

       high-waisted denim dreams come true too) 👖👖👖👖#GapDenimFutures 📷 :
       @joegalvin
     * Not to *totally* bombard you with wedding stuff (only a few more
       posts I promise), but I’ve just shared my blog post about all
       things wedding dress and dress shopping- so if you’re currently on
       the 👀 out hopefully this might shed some light on the process and
       what to keep and mind (and what is definitely not worth worrying
       about too). It can be an exciting, overwhelming time- so hopefully
       this might reassure you if you’re feeling that it’s all a bit much
       (and make you excited for some ~srs~ parading around)... link in

       dads-speech-weep all over again so thank you, thank you. I also
       wanted to say a little (huge) thank you to all of our brilliant
       suppliers on the day, who made it everything we wished it would be.

       covers, which you’d never even thought about in the first place.
       Remembering why it is you’re doing this, what *actually* is
       important and that people may well not even remember to pick up
       their favours at the end either are all worth keeping in mind- but
       if you want some extra details (including our order of service and
       a few lil tips) I’ve popped a link in my bio and stories too ✨ 📷:

       Blinded By The Light and one too many listens of My Sweet Lord

     * Not to *totally* bombard you with wedding stuff (only a few more
       posts I promise), but I’ve just shared my blog post about all
       things wedding dress and dress shopping- so if you’re currently on
       the 👀 out hopefully this might shed some light on the process and
       what to keep and mind (and what is definitely not worth worrying
       about too). It can be an exciting, overwhelming time- so hopefully
       this might reassure you if you’re feeling that it’s all a bit much
       (and make you excited for some ~srs~ parading around)... link in
       bio (and on stories too)! Dress: @naeemkhanbride via

     * Happy Saturday folks ✨ thank you for all of the loveliness on our
       wedding video. The comments alone are enough to make me do a
       dads-speech-weep all over again so thank you, thank you. I also
       wanted to say a little (huge) thank you to all of our brilliant
       suppliers on the day, who made it everything we wished it would be.
       We were so, so lucky with how everything came together and cannot
       recommend then all enough. There’s more in the blog post that’s up
       at the moment, but for anyone asking I’ve popped them here too 💗

       latest wedding post, but I thought I’d share it here too. Thank you
       @papertwinwed (and @thecurries.co) for capturing the most magical
       day. (Papertwin generously offered their services to us
       complimentary, but I can not recommend them enough- eye wateringly
       brilliant in more ways than one)
     * 25th May 2019, our wedding day is now up on the blog (featuring
       bare foot dancing, and our favourite friend, Colin) ⭐️ (P.S you can
       also see part of our wedding video in the post too, so I hope you
       love it as much as I do- and have tissues handy) 📷: @thecurries.co

The 12 Hour Autumn Edinburgh Itinerary

   I’ve been lucky enough to visit Edinburgh a fair few times now- both in
   the summertime and winter, and it continues to be one of the most
   beautiful cities to explore and stay in.

An afternoon in rainy Edinburgh

The Big Vintage Revival (And A Dream Dress To Boot)

   The year is 2009 (or 8, I’m terrible with dates). I’m on Brick Lane
   with a handful of my friends, and we’re rifling through rails of
   slightly musky ‘80s floral dresses, wax jackets that smell slightly of
   old, damp National Trust properties and pointed ankle boots with fur
   lined ankles...

     * *default cold weather outfit* ❄️🤧❄️
     * As well as talking about endless book bits (which I cannot thank
       you ENOUGH for the kindness and support of), there’s also lots of
       shiny new blog content up on my blog, What Olivia Did- including
       new autumnal guides from both Glasgow and Edinburgh (and the best
       ever hot chocolate), a playlist and some other chatty posts, if you
       fancy some Sunday reading. I thought I’d upload this before I fall
       deep into an I’m A Celebrity and Strictly hole- and also ask if
       anyone has been to NY in January too- we may be planning a
       (belated) post wedding getaway... ❄️❄️❄️❄️
     * IT’S HERE! The official cover for The Insecure Girl’s Handbook is
       finally baked and ready which means it’s so, so close to being
       released into the world- AHH! How has it come round this quickly?!
       Although this one is a ~teeny~ bit different (sans lovely gold
       lettering), I’m so proud and excited of how she looks and can’t
       wait for you to all get your mitts on it. It’s been the biggest,
       most daunting, palm sweating and exciting thing I’ve ever worked on
       and I can’t believe after all these months it’s *so* close to being
       out there. IT HAS A BARCODE AND EVERYTHING. Plus, I’m 10/10 excited
       to have @jasminedowling’s beautiful lettering on the cover too-
       what a DREAM. If you’d like to preorder (which I know everyone says
       to do, but it genuinely is so helpful), I’ve popped both a link in
       my bio and stories- which would mean the absolute world if you’d
       like to take a look. I’m SO excited about this and really hope you
       are too- NOT LONG NOW! @theinsecuregirlsclub ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
     * As well as Edgar I also spend a lot of time thinking about these
       heavenly pjs and headboard... ☁️ @johnlewisandpartners #ad
       #jlfashion #jlhome 📷: @dunjaopalko
     * Killing time has never looked so beautiful- tripped and fell (quite
       literally, I’m a clumsy fool) into @miumiu and now all I can think
       about is glitter, velvet and collars ☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️
     * Cosy doorways in Edinburgh (and plenty of beautiful houses I’d
       happily occupy) on the blog this evening (amongst other things,
       it’s not just lovely doors folks) 🍂🍂🍂
