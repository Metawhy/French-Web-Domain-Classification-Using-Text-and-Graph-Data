   Does Facebook allow me to run contests directly on my Timeline?
   Yes! since August 27, 2013, you can run a contest on your Timeline
   without using a third part application. Learn more here.

   Are there rules for running a contest on my Timeline?
   Absolutely! To learn more about what you can or can't do, we urge you
   to read this article.

   Why do I need an Agorapulse app? Can’t I run a Timeline contest without
   it?
   You can definitely do it without our application, but, filtering the
   likes and comments manually will take hours of work. Why waste your
   time counting likes when you could sip a cocktail from the hammock
   instead?

   Is this really free? No hidden costs?
   These apps are 100% free, and always will be. There are no hidden costs
   at all. You can run any type of contest, as many times as you want, on
   any number of pages you manage, whatever their size. All for free. If
   you really really like them, you can tweet and share the love, that
   will be appreciated :-)
