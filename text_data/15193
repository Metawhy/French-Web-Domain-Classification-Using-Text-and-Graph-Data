   time last week I was frolicking around in the absolutely STUNNING To
   Sua Ocean Trench in Samoa 😍 . . Those greens are that green 💚 the
   turquoise waters really that turquoise 💙 - and there has been no
   editing or enhancement on any of these snaps, just pure unfiltered
   natural beauty 🥰 We could have stayed there for hours! . . Swipe right
   for some shots into the canyon featuring my fugly toes for scale, a top
   down of the climb in (thanks @2aussietravellers for capturing that
   hair-raising moment 🙈) and three of us having the time of our lives 🤩 .
