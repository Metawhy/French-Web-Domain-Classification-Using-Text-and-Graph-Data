   The webservice-energy.org platform is an effort carried out by the
   center Observation, Impacts, Energy (O.I.E.) of MINES
   ParisTech / ARMINES and also from the SoDa Team toward the Energy and
   Environmental Community.

   The webservice-energy.org platform is recognized as a GEOSS Community
   Portal. It has been previously registered in the GEOSS Data Provider
   Yellow Page listing and it is part of the Discovery and Access Broker
   (DAB) resources list. Consequently all resources deployed under these
   platforms are available in the GEO Portal.

   The webservice-energy.org platform hosts a collection of Web Services
   offering data and applications in Renewable Energy and Environment.

   The exploitation of Renewable Energy sources such as solar and wind
   energy requires accurate knowledge of the resources and their
   availability -in space and time- as well as accurate forecasts in the
   different phases of an energy system life cycle.

   Web services are a efficient means to access to up-to-date knowledge by
   achieving connections, and facilitating exchange of data, applications,
   and information between actors. The Web services are made available to
   the community by various providers on a for-free access or restricted
   access basis.

   Services are based either on:
     * W3C standards (WSDL) and SOAP protocol
     * or OGC Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Services (WFS), Web
       Processing Service (WPS) and Sensor Observation Services (SOS) and
       Thredds data Server (TDS)

   Cataloging is powered by an OGC Web Catalog Service for the Web (CSW)
   known as the Webservice-Energy Catalog.

   You can access, search and discover hundreds of Energy and
   Environmental related resources by connecting to: Webservice-Energy
   Catalog

   Webservice-Energy benefits from and provides support to various
   institutions, research project, SME's, international initiatives and
   learned society such as:
     * The Global Atlas for Renewable Energy from IRENA
     * Clean Energy Ministerial
     * GEO / GEOSS
     * IEA - SHC Task 46 and PVPS Task 12
     * European Funded Projects:
          + FP7 framework program (EnerGEO,ENDORSE)
          + Horizon 2020 (ConnectinGEO)
     * Copernicus MACC project
     * Open Geospatial Consortium
     * French Foreign Affair Ministry
     * French local, regional and national research programs
     * SME's (SoDa)

   Several local and remote clients are exploiting and/or combining the
   webservice-energy.org resources. Examples of such graphical clients can
   be accessed through the webservice-Energy.org Tools &
   Applications section.


Tools & Applications

   Access to environmental performance of PV systems:

   Access to in-situ measurements:

   Access to the geo-catalogue:

   Access to marine energy data:
