   brochettes BBQ

   In France, we do  barbecue or BBQ mostly with Merguez  (Lamb sausages)
   and brochettes (vegetables/ meat on skewers) served with salads and
   rice. We rarely do burgers or hot dogs like in the States. So few
   months ago during a relaxing and lazy week end, we invited our friends
   Michael, Jackie,Dani, Barbara and Terry for a French BBQ.
   melon-Parma

   The night before on Friday Joel made a beautiful, fruity, delicious red
   Sangria.

   Saturdaym morning I made les Brochettes ( beef and chicken vegetables
   skewers) and marinated them  in olive oil and fresh herbs. I
   made the same marinade  that my sister and mother make in France, every
   summer.
   brochettes

   brochettes

   Few hours before our BBQ I cooked white Basmati rice  and cooked
   Zuchini and Tomatoes a la Provencale and Joel made and bake his French
   baguettes.

   I asked our friends to bring some Finger foods , tapas style . We also
   ordered some Merguez on line via Dartagnan that we sandwiched in fresh
   baguette spreaded with homemade Harissa : Harissa is in North Africa
   mainly Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisia what American call hot chili
   paste or Asian shirasha.Harissa is added to couscous, soups, pastas and
   other recipes. It can also be purchased in Middle Eastern stores in a
   tube or jars. My homemade recipe is below.

   For hours between the food, the pool ,la petanque game – a form of
   bocce game (popuar all over France but mostly in Provence and Marseille
   )where the goal is, while standing inside a starting circle with both
   feet on the ground, to throw metal balls as close as possible to a
   small wooden ball called a cochonnet , the Sangria we  spent a lovely
   evening.

   ½ tsp cumin seeds

   100 ml olive oil , plus a little extra

   4 garlic cloves, peeled but kept whole

   1 tsp smoked paprika

   6  tomatoes, deseeded and chopped

   1 Fresno chilies , deseeded (use more chilies if you like it very
   fiery)

   Heat the spice seeds in a dry pan until lightly toasted and aromatic,
   then lightly crush using a pestle and mortar.

   Heat the oil in a large pan and add the garlic, toasted spices,
   paprika, tomatoes and chillies. Cook over a low heat, stirring
   frequently, until the tomato flesh has cooked down to a pulp and the
   garlic is tender – this will take about 15 mins.

   Remove from the heat and blend it pulse in a food processor to make a
   rough paste. Spoon into a sterilized jar and pour a little oil over the
   surface to completely cover it. Will keep in the fridge for several
   months if you cover the surface with oil after each use.

Excuse me? 3 $ for a mini-tiny cheesecake ?

   IMG_5176
   This morning on my way to the Public Library I stopped at Truly Madly
   Sweetly a little “family owned and operated bakery specializing in
   creative and distinctive cheesecakes and cupcakes, combining classic
   fresh French training with a fresh and delicious homemade taste”.
   I never been inside and since I noticed that they are opening another
   store at La Promenade Temecula CA, I thought that to stop at this shop
   in Murrieta, and have a look would be worth it. Nice boutique but no
   charm or anything as a real Parisian French Pastry Shop. No smell
   either. I like to enter a bakery where it smell cookies, cakes, sugar.
   I looked at the tiny-mini Cheesecakes, very small indeed and read their
   names. Some sounded interesting: hummingbird ,pucker up ,almond bliss
   …but I was thinking oh my God a single bite and it is gone!They are so
   small, they looked cute but small. So when I asked the lady how much
   were the Cheesecakes and when she said $3 I could not believe it. $ 3
   for a small bite. I am sure they use natural ingredients, no dyes… OK,
   OK I think this is wonderful and I am sure that these cheesecakes one
   day I will try them. Their Cupcakes same thing pretty small but a
   little bigger that the cheesecakes are $2.75 each
   filled cupcakes are $3.00 each. Again I was in schock.
   Well sorry but I left without buying any. First because I am not a big
   fan of Cupcakes, I prefer a good Cheesecake but one bite is never
   enough and the prices were well pricey.

   Once in a while I like delicious cakes, cookies…like everyone I guess.
   So when my sister and my niece sent me “Sucre” le Livre Laduree Paris I
   was thrilled. Inside the book 100 recipes from the Pastry Chef at the
   prestigious Laduree Paris. This book is a precious object, designed to
   look and feel like one of their cult boxes of macarons, famous for
   their pastel colors and sophistication.
   You want to eat every single page. So when my 6 year daugther decided
   to have this book on her bedside to decide which pastry we will make
   together I was happy.
   After a long time, turning, studying each page we decided to go for ”
   Savarin” , better known as a Baba in the UK, is a light, sophisticated
   summer dessert. A light yeast dough is baked and submerged in a hot
   syrup of Grand Marnier and secret spices . Because I was baking with my
   daughter and because she and her brother will eat it I used homemade
   Orange juice with sugar instead. We left it to cool, finish with
   chantilly cream, strawberries Too good.

   Savarin Adapted from “Sucre” Laduree book
   Cake
   • 1-1/2 teaspoons yeast
   • 1 tablespoon sugar
   • 1/2 teaspoon salt
   • 2 tablespoons warm water
   • 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
   • 2 tablespoons milk
   • Organic Lemon zest
   • 1 cup flour
   • 1/4 cup butter, softened
   Syrup
   • 2 cups fresh squeezed orange juice
   • 1/4 cups sugar
   • Organic lemon zest
   Topping
   • 2 cups heavy cream
   • A few drops of vanilla extract
   • 1 to 2 Tbsp sugar
   • A few generous handfuls of fresh strawberries

   Directions
   Cake
   1. Butter and flour a 10-inch/25 cm ring mould. Mix the yeast, sugar,
   salt, and warm water in a large bowl and let stand 5 minutes. Add the
   eggs, milk, zest, and flour. Beat vigorously in a stand-up mixture with
   paddle attachment for a full 10 minutes. This is necessary to make the
   dough smooth and elastic, pulling away from the sides of the bowl,
   which will result in a very light, fine-textured cake. Cover and let
   rise in a warm place for an hour.
   2. Punch down the dough. Beat in the softened butter, a piece at a
   time, until fully incorporated. Spoon the mixture into the mould,
   evenly. Cover, and let rise again for two hours.
   3. Heat the oven to 350°F/175°C. Bake the Savarin until golden brown,
   20 minutes. Remove from mould onto a cooling rack, then transfer to a
   large serving platter.
   Syrup
   1. For the syrup, bring the water and sugar to a boil in a saucepan 1
   minute. Stir the orange juice and zest. Ladle the syrup over the cake,
   until fully absorbed. The cake will expand and become very sponge-like
   in texture.
   Topping
   1. To serve, whip the cream with the vanilla and sugar. Dollop of
   whipped cream on the top of the savarin and, if desired, a shot of
   orange juice pour over warm cake.

   Very proud of my daughter Z. who chose the cake and helped me in every
   step, and of course she devored it and her brother too!

       Now I question all your recommendations…having lived in Paris for
       ten years and frequenting Laduree and many other exquisite places,
       and currently living in New York City but ALWAYS dreaming of the
       cupcakes from Truly Madly Sweetly. Lets be honest, there is little
       quality in the Inland Valley (yes, the Farmers Market is great), so
       when we get it, lets recognize it and support it. $2.75 for a
       cupcake, $3.00 for cheesecake – priceless! Living in Paris and New
       York there is one thing you learn quickly, you get what you pay
       for! One more note, Truly Madly Sweetly is not a Parisian cafe,
       it’s a California gem and the pink and white wallpaper is pretty
       too!

       Ah oui, but how much would a similar patisserie be in, say, Ladurée
       or Gérard Mulot or Pierre Hermé, et. al.? Much more actually, no?

       I met you at your first cooking class demonstration at the Kitchen
       Fantasy store. I will try this recipe!! Thanks for sharing it! How
       much Grand Marnier if I use that instead of Orange juice?
