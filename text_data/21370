Adding the wrong words

   Sunday, October 6, 2019

   My 4-year-old leaves so many drawings lying around that sometimes I
   steal them and add my own captions. I made the mistake of showing this
   batch to him — he was absolutely furious that I added the wrong words
   to his pictures!

Everyone can be Batman

   Saturday, October 5, 2019

   You ever get bored and draw Batman masks on everybody in the New York
   Times Book Review?

   I joked about this on Twitter and @philipkennedy blew my mind with this
   story:

     When producer Michael Uslan was first thinking about how to bring a
     darker version of Batman to the big screen, back in 1980, he saw a
     photo of Jack Nicholson from The Shining in the newspaper — and he
     started drawing on it. Uslan turned Nicholson’s famous “Here’s
     Johnny!” face into the Clown Prince of Crime. And, just nine years
     later, the rest was movie history.

   Holy White-Out, Batman!

Notice when you are happy

   Drawing by Jules, age 4

   Despite the news and our country being run by utter turds, I have to
   say I am really enjoying my life right now.

   The older I get, the more I try to say these things out loud.

   It’s something I learned from Kurt Vonnegut in A Man Without a Country:

The lesson of grace

   Thursday, October 3, 2019

   I don’t know why, exactly — laziness, perhaps? — but I was moved this
   morning to just take photos of my diary with my Quickscan app and post
   them here without further comment, just links:
     * Francis Su, “The Lesson of Grace in Teaching” (h/t @mattthomas)
     * Tom Junod, “Can You Say…Hero?”
     * Wendy Murray Zoba, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”

Drawers

   Wednesday, October 2, 2019

   I’m not sure why it took me so long to figure this out, but when I
   moved into my new office, I realized it’d be really handy if I kept my
   pocket notebooks and logbooks and other materials in drawers that I
   could easily access, instead of on a shelf or in a box somewhere out of
   reach. (In the past, I’d stored blank notebooks and new pens and other
   supplies in there, but those are things I only need once in a while…)

   The top drawer is my favorite: it’s where I keep little bits and scraps
   of paper that I can use for collages later…

   In other news: I like words.

Digging and scratching

   Tuesday, October 1, 2019
   DJ Shadow, Endtroducing

   In a recent edition of his excellent newsletter companion to his book,
   The Art of Noticing, my friend Rob Walker wrote about the spirit of DJs
   digging through record crates featured in the documentary Scratch:

     You have to spend the time to sort through the junk to find the
     treasure. There is no shortcut…. I like to try to apply this spirit
     of crate-digging to everyday life. The only way to find the good
     stuff, the special stuff, the genuine moments and the true
     inspiration, is to first engage with the everyday, the mundane, the
     seemingly useless, the things nobody else seems to care about. So
     engage. There is no shortcut; there is no algorithm. If all you do
     is track what’s trending, then all you’ll ever know is exactly what
     everyone else already knew. To discover, you have to dig.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4I3CovIKJWE?feature=oembed

   I was reminded of chapter six of Twyla Tharp’s The Creative Habit,
   entitled, appropriately enough, “Scratching”:

     You know how you scratch away at a lottery ticket to see if you’ve
     won? That’s what I’m doing when I begin a piece. I’m digging through
     everything to find something. It’s like clawing the side of a
     mountain to get a toehold, a grip, some sort of traction to keep
     moving upward and onward….. Scratching can look like borrowing or
     appropriating, but it’s an essential part of creativity. It’s
     primal, and very private. It’s a way of saying to the gods, “Oh,
     don’t mind me, I’ll just wander around in these back hallways…” and
     then grabbing that piece of fire and running like hell.

   (Emphasis mine.)

Discovering the masterpiece right in front of you

   Monday, September 30, 2019

   While reading Alan Jacobs’ newsletter, I came across the story of a
   woman in her 90s who’d kept a painting above her hotplate that turned
   out to be a Cimabue worth six million bucks. (Cimabue was born in
   Florence in 1240. Vasari tells a story that he found Giotto  drawing
   sheep from his flock on a rock and asked if he’d like to be his
   apprentice. )

   I admit it’s not as exciting, but I also recently discovered a
   masterpiece hanging in my house. My wife and I bought this poster at a
   Botticelli show in Florence in 2004. We call her “The Botticelli
   Woman,” and she guards our front door:

   In the 15 years that she’s hung in our entryways, I’ve never actually
   bothered to look up what painting she’s from. Then I was flipping
   through a book of Botticelli paintings at the thrift store and saw
   Pallas and the Centaur:

   She’s always had a calming effect on me, and yet, I always had the
   feeling she should be guarding the place. Well, turns out my intuition
   was correct: That poster is a helluva crop! “The halberd,” that crazy
   axe-looking thing she’s holding, “was a weapon carried by guards rather
   than on the battlefield.”

   How many things do we keep around our house whose histories we know
   nothing about?

More block printing

   Sunday, September 29, 2019

   The boys and I sat around the kitchen table this weekend and made some
   more block prints.

   The four-year-old is still too little to do his own carving, so I had
   him draw on the block and I carved it for him. (His is the skeleton on
   the right, the others are by the six-year-old.)

Backing up

   Saturday, September 28, 2019

   I got a “First strike! Three strikes and you’re out!” copyright notice
   from Tumblr yesterday morning, and my first thought was, “Oh good,
   maybe I can totally forget about my Tumblr now.”

   One of the biggest regrets of my online life is the gap half decade or
   so I moved most of my blogging activity over to Tumblr from this
   self-hosted WordPress blog. Tumblr (and Twitter) has been my public
   notebook — there are blog tags there that have become book chapters and
   many more that still might. If they delete my Tumblr, it’s a decade of
   public research gone bye-bye.

   Believe it or not, you can actually back up your Tumblr blog now direct
   from their site. My blog took all night to export and the download
   wound up weighing in at 3.75GB. (The biggest surprise was all the .mp3
   files that came through: they made a 10-hour playlist in iTunes!)

   You can also download your Twitter archive and it comes with a handy
   index.html file that you can search and browse.

   All this stuff will go away one day. Like I said in Show Your Work!:

   Own your turf, own your turf, own your turf. (And try to back up
   whatever you’ve posted to turf you don’t own.)

Drawings have the right to exist

   Friday, September 27, 2019

   Lynda Barry, who we’ve all known was a genius, but is now officially
   one, posted these images on Instagram from “The Night We All Got
   Sick,” the first comic in The Greatest of Marlys, with the following
   caption:

     These are the first drawings of Marlys. I didn’t know who she was or
     that I was about to spend the next 30 years with her. I was just
     making a comic strip about cousins getting sick after a parade. I
     didnt know who any of them where when they first showed up that day.
     And I was on the fence about them, wondering should I keep this
     drawing or not? It scares me to think how easily I could have thrown
     her away on this first day because I didn’t like the way she
     “looked”, because the drawing didn’t please me. I believe drawings
     have the same right to exist as I do. I’m so glad I kept the
     drawing. I’m so glad I didn’t throw her out.

   “I believe Maryls conjures me as much as I conjure her,” Lynda writes
   in the book’s introduction. “The portable between her world and mine is
   a pen line made by the living mystery of this hand, this hand that
   looks like yours.”

   We create our drawings and they create us.
