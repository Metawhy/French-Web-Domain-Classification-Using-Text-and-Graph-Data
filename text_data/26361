   Going away! We are building a holistic malware hunting platform to give
   good the advantage. VirusTotal Intelligence is becoming part of VT
   Enterprise, a service that also encompasses VT Hunting, VT Graph and VT
   API.

   You may access the platform at https://www.virustotal.com/gui/.
   Provided you are signed in and have the pertinent privileges, the
   public website becomes VT Enterprise and the search box will allow you
   to perform your traditional faceted searches.

   Feedback and bug reports are more than welcome as we kick this off, you
   can reach out to us at contact@virustotal.com. You can still access the
   old interface at https://www.virustotal.com/intelligence/search/ ,
   HOWEVER, please make sure you send over feedback and suggestions
   regarding the new interface so that we can address them and improve
   your workflow once the old interface is deprecated. Your opinion is
   important.
   Challenge Hints Solution

   A bragging crook

   You have been tracking several underground forums, mostly brazilian,
   during an investigation regarding brazilian banking trojans used to
   intercept credentials to online banking sites in order to perform
   unauthorized wire transfers to cyber-crook accounts.

   Using Google translator (your Portuguese is not that good yet) you have
   identified a crook that on during the last month was bragging about how
   he had developed a new trojan, screenshots of VirusTotal followed in
   his post, he had used the public web interface to benchmark his
   creation.

   Using VirusTotal Intelligence, can you tell me the hash of a file that
   could be the crook's malware?
   File hash ____________________ (BUTTON) Submit

Hints

   It is always good to take a close look at the documentation, there are
   certain search modifiers that will allow you to focus on file
   candidates that could match the described criteria.
     * submitter
       This modifier allows you to search for samples according to the ISO
       3166-1-alpha-2 of the country of the first submitter. It also
       allows you to filter according to the submission interface used:
       web, api, email, etc.
     * fs (first submitted)
       The fs modifier allows you to focus on samples first submitted
       within a given time range.

Solution

   We want to look for files uploaded from Brazil, sent through the web
   interface during the last month. Any of the hits returned by the
   following search will solve the challenge:

   submitter:BR submitter:web fs:2019-08-26+ fs:2019-09-26-

   tool. Did you know that VirusTotal Intelligence, an advanced analytics
   layer over the VirusTotal database, helps you perform malware threat
   hunting, relationship and behavioral visualization, and historical
   analysis on billions of malware samples?

   With VTI, you can better defend against malware within your network.

VirusTotal Intelligence for threat investigations

   VirusTotal Intelligence provides extensive information to accelerate
   malware threat investigations. Analysts can quickly build a picture of
   an attack and then use the information to better protect against other
   attacks.

   In the course of an investigation, security analysts and incident
   responders are often presented with a file hash and asked to make sense
   of an attack. Unfortunately, this is like being given only a bullet and
   then asked to uncover an entire plot. Without further context, it is
   virtually impossible to perform attribution, build effective defenses
   against other strains of the attack, or understand the impact of a
   given threat on an organization. Connect the dots with VirusTotal and
   uncover the plot.

VirusTotal Intelligence for banking trojans

   Disable banking trojans with VTI's advanced capabilities.

   Certain industries are especially at risk of password-stealing trojans,
   which capture customers' account credentials and then use those to
   transfer funds. Financial services are at very high risk of credential
   theft, which leads to increased costs as well as reputation damage.

   This paper describes, in detail, how to use VTI to gather the
   information necessary to shut down the infrastructure that supports
   banking trojans.

Mitigating False-Positives to Improve Software Publishing

   For software publishers as well as corporate developers, antivirus
   false positives can stop users in their tracks and shut down revenue.
   VirusTotal Monitor creates an accelerated path to resolving false
   positive results -- before they cause harm.

   Most users see VirusTotal as a tool for detecting malware and malicious
   behavior. As one of the world’s largest malware intelligence services,
   VirusTotal is used by millions of people every day to perform basic
   research on malware. However, since VirusTotal integrates results from
   70+ antivirus solutions, it may also be used to discover legitimate
   files that are misclassified by AV products. This is what the industry
   calls false positives and they continue to be a major problem for
   software publishers of any size. To help both the antivirus industry
   and software publishers worldwide, we have developed VirusTotal
   Monitor. VirusTotal Monitor is designed to help software publishers
   identify potential false-positive issues with their products, and to
   streamline the process of communicating these issues before they cause
   lost money and time.
