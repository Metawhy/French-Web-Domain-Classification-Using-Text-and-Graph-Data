OSA Launches New Climate-Research Center in Collaboration with AGU and the
University of Strathclyde

   Global Environmental Measurement and Monitoring Network (GEMM)
   Initiative

   WASHINGTON -- The Optical Society (OSA) applauds the launch of a new
   multidisciplinary climate-research center as part of the Global
   Environmental Measurement and Monitoring (GEMM) Initiative, OSA’s
   flagship international public policy effort.

   The new center—established by the University of Strathclyde in
   Scotland—is joining a growing global network of regional environmental
   centers established to better understand and forecast the local impacts
   of climate change. The Strathclyde center combines the university’s
   strengths in economics, law, optics and geophysics to better understand
   Scotland’s resources and their usage and impacts, and follows the
   launch of the GEMM Initiative at an affiliated event of the Global
   Climate Action Summit in September 2018.

   A workshop to kick off the Strathclyde GEMM Center was held on 13
   September 2019 in Glasgow. Among the global dignitaries, technology
   developers and renowned researchers in attendance were Sheila Rowan,
   chief scientific adviser for the Scottish government; Carol Monaghan,
   Member of Parliament, U.K.; Tom Baer, 2009 OSA president from Stanford
   University, U.S.A.; Louise Bedsworth, a representative of the
   Governor’s Office of California, U.S.A; and Graeme Roy, head of the
   Fraser of Allander Institute of the University of Strathclyde.

   OSA is also pleased to announce its collaboration with the American
   Geophysical Union (AGU) on the GEMM Initiative. The initiative is
   engaging universities, research institutes, governments, companies, and
   nonprofits around the world to form regional climate research centers
   like the one recently established in Scotland. Other GEMM centers under
   discussion involve the University of California at Berkeley and
   Stanford University in the U.S.A., the Dodd-Walls Center for Photonic
   and Quantum Technologies in New Zealand, and the Sentinel North at
   Université Laval program in Québec, Canada.

   These regional centers will operate independently, sharing new
   measurement technologies and improving climate models, providing more
   accurate forecasts of the impacts of climate change on their specific
   regions, training multidisciplinary researchers, and working closely
   with climate service organizations to provide crucial data and models
   for policymakers and communities. OSA and AGU will facilitate sharing
   of research results and new technology between the centers.

   “Climate change is one of the major policy and science challenges
   facing society in the coming decade and beyond,” said Elizabeth Rogan,
   OSA's chief executive officer. "With the launch of this
   first-of-its-kind center, the GEMM Initiative is on course to provide
   essential research tools to regional decision makers.”

   Priority issues common to the GEMM centers include, among others,
   developing reliable and cost-effective technologies for mapping air
   quality in dense urban areas over time and distance, tracking the
   incursion of saltwater into fresh ground-water sources, predicting the
   changing seasonal availability of fresh water, and monitoring the rapid
   and complex changes in the polar environments. Optics and photonics
   technologies play a key role in many of these measurement challenges.

   The GEMM Initiative is exploring additional regional centers to improve
   data availability, forecasting, instrumentation, and ultimately, policy
   decisions. The initiative welcomes discussions with interested parties
   around the world.

Optical Imager Poised to Improve Diagnosis and Treatment of Dry Eye Disease

   New non-invasive instrument images layers of the eye’s protective tear
   film with speed and precision

   WASHINGTON — Researchers have developed a new non-invasive optical
   imaging system that promises to improve diagnosis and treatments for
   dry eye disease. Dry eye, which often causes irritation and blurred
   vision, occurs when there is instability in the inner layer of the tear
   film that protects the outside of the eye.

   Caption: The Tear Film Imager captures a raw image (a) and also
   generates a thickness map (b) derived from the color information at
   each pixel. This can be used to distinguish the tear film’s inner
   layers.

   Today, most cases of dry eye are diagnosed using patient
   questionnaires, which may be subjective and cannot typically be used to
   identify the cause of the disease. Objective methods for examining the
   tear film tend to be invasive and cannot track rapid changing dynamics,
   which are altered with every blink.

   “Up to 60 percent of ophthalmology office visits are due to dry eye,
   pointing to the need for a non-invasive and highly accurate device for
   diagnosis in the office setting,” said research team leader Dr. Yoel
   Arieli from AdOM Advanced Optical Methods Ltd. in Israel. “Our Tear
   Film Imager is the first device that can be used in the ophthalmology
   or optometry setting to image the tear film and distinguish its inner
   layers with nanometer resolution.”

   In the Optical Society (OSA) journal Applied Optics, researchers
   describe the device’s ability to perform spectral measurements across a
   large field of view in a matter of seconds. They report that the imager
   can acquire fast and consistent measurements from human eyes even when
   blinking.

   The research study was performed at AdOM Advanced Optical Methods
   laboratory. The proof of concept, unique method and design that enable
   measurement of ultra-thin tear layers with nanometer resolution were
   developed by AdOM’s development team led by Dr. Yoel Cohen.

   Improving diagnosis through imaging

   “For the diagnosis of dry eye disease, there have been few significant
   advancements over recent years,” said Dr. Arieli. “We collaborated with
   academic and practicing physicians who diagnose and treat dry eye to
   develop an instrument that can be integrated into a clinical setting
   while very accurately imaging the tear film inner layers, which can be
   used to diagnose dry eye and understand its cause.”

   Caption: The Tear Film Imager is designed for use in an ophthalmology
   or optometry office. Pictured is the prototype device.

   The new instrument uses an eye-safe halogen light to illuminate the eye
   and then analyzes the full spectrum of light reflection over time and
   space. These spectral measurements are used to reconstruct the
   structures found in the front of the eye, allowing accurate measurement
   of the tear film inner layers, especially the aqueous sublayer. This
   sublayer plays an important role in dry eye but has been difficult to
   analyze with other methods.

   “The broadband illumination source and fine details available from
   spectral analysis provide nanometer-level insight into subtle changes
   in each tear film layer and sublayer,” said Dr. Arieli. “These
   measurements are completed automatically in just 40 seconds.”

   After demonstrating a resolution of 2.2 nanometers on a mock tear film,
   the researchers tested the instrument’s ability to take measurements on
   the human eye with no intervention while the patient was blinking. “The
   device worked impressively and presents no risk because it is
   non-invasive and uses a simple light source,” said Dr. Arieli. “It not
   only measured the tear film consistently including blinks every few
   seconds, but the measurements correlated well with other partially
   invasive, established dry eye diagnostic techniques.”

   The Tear Film Imager has been used in two clinical studies in Israel
   and Canada, examining dry eye diagnosis with the device and dry eye
   treatments, which can be precisely evaluated with the imager. The
   researchers say that future studies could help inform better dry eye
   treatments, improve surgical outcomes and lead to more accurate fitting
   of contact lenses. They are also planning to use the Tear Film Imager
   in larger studies with more diverse groups of patients to set base
   levels for both healthy eyes and people with dry eye.

Tunable Optical Chip Paves Way for New Quantum Devices

   Researchers demonstrate first fully integrated silicon carbide optical
   switch that can be thermally tuned for different functions

   WASHINGTON — Researchers have created a silicon carbide (SiC) photonic
   integrated chip that can be thermally tuned by applying an electric
   signal. The approach could one day be used to create a large range of
   reconfigurable devices such as phase-shifters and tunable optical
   couplers needed for networking applications and quantum information
   processing.

   Caption: Researchers created the first thermally tunable optical switch
   using a silicon carbide-on-insulator platform. The schematic image
   shows their concept for a quantum photonics integrated circuit chip
   that includes the circular microring resonators and microheaters
   reported in Optics Letters. The inset shows the temperature and
   electric field distributions at the cross-section of a microring
   resonator heated by a microheater.

   Although most optical and computer chips are made of silicon, there is
   increasing interest in SiC because it exhibits better thermal,
   electrical and mechanical properties than silicon while also being
   biocompatible and operating at wavelengths from the visible to
   infrared.

   In The Optical Society (OSA) journal Optics Letters, researchers led by
   Ali Adibi from the Georgia Institute of Technology detail how they
   integrated a microheater and an optical device called a microring
   resonator onto a SiC chip. The accomplishment represents the first
   fully integrated and thermally tunable SiC optical switch that operates
   at near-infrared wavelengths.

   “Devices such as the one we demonstrate in this work can be used as
   building-blocks for next generation quantum information processing
   devices and to create biocompatible sensors and probes,” said the
   paper’s first author Xi Wu.

   SiC is particularly attractive for quantum computing and communication
   applications because it has defects that can be optically controlled
   and manipulated as quantum bits, or qubits. Quantum computing and
   communication promises to be significantly faster than traditional
   computing at solving certain problems because data is encoded in qubits
   that can be in any combination of two states at once, allowing many
   processes to be performed simultaneously.

   Wafer-level manufacturing

   The new work builds on the researchers’ previous development of a
   platform called crystalline SiC-on-insulator that overcomes some of the
   fragility and other drawbacks of previously reported SiC platforms
   while providing an easy and reliable route for integration with
   electronic devices.

   “The SiC-on-insulator platform our group pioneered is similar to the
   silicon-on-insulator technology widely used in semiconductor industry
   for a variety of applications,” said Tianren Fan, member of the
   research team. “It enables wafer-level manufacturing of SiC devices,
   paving the way toward commercialization of integrated photonic quantum
   information processing solutions based on SiC,” said Ali A. Eftekhar,
   member of the research team.

   Fully exploiting the new platform’s unique capabilities required
   developing the ability to tune its optical properties so that a single
   chip-based structure can be used to provide different functions. The
   researchers accomplished this by using the thermo-optic effect in which
   changing a material’s temperature modifies its optical properties, such
   as refractive index.

   silicon carbide optical switch include Ali Adibi, Tianren Fan, Xi Wu
   and Ali A. Eftekhar (left to right).

   They began by fabricating tiny ring-shaped optical cavities, or
   microring resonators, using the crystalline SiC-on-insulator
   technology. In each resonator, light at certain wavelengths, called its
   resonance wavelengths, traveling around the ring will build up strength
   through constructive interference. The resonator then can be used to
   control the amplitude and phase of the light in a waveguide coupled to
   it. To create a tunable resonator with a high degree of control, the
   researchers fabricated electric heaters on top of the microrings. When
   an electric current is applied to the integrated microheater, it
   locally increases the temperature of the SiC microring and thus changes
   its resonant wavelengths thanks to the thermo-optic effect.

   Testing the integrated device

   The researchers tested the performance of the fabricated integrated
   microring resonators and microheaters by applying different levels of
   electrical power and then measuring the optical transmission of the
   waveguide coupled to the microring resonator. Their results showed that
   it is possible to achieve high-quality resonators with low-power
   thermal tunability through a robust device that can be manufactured
   using existing semiconductor foundry processes.

   “Combined with other unique features of our crystalline
   SiC-on-insulator platform, these high-quality devices have the basic
   requirements for enabling new chip-scale devices that operate in a wide
   range of wavelengths,” said Ali Adibi, the team leader.  “This
   chip-scale tunability is essential for performing quantum operations
   necessary for quantum computing and communication. In addition, because
   of the biocompatibility of SiC, it could be very useful for in vivo
   biosensing.”

   The researchers are now working to build elements with the crystalline
   SiC-on-insulator platform for quantum photonic integrated circuits,
   including on-chip pump lasers, single photon sources and single photon
   detectors that could be used with the tunable microring resonator to
   create a fully functional chip for advanced optical quantum computing.

   This work is the result of three years of extensive research in forming
   a reliable hybrid platform with considerably improved SiC material
   properties and using it for forming innovative devices. Xi Wu, Tianren
   Fan, and Ali A. Eftekhar in Ali Adibi’s research group contributed
   immensely to this work. Hesam Moradinejad, a former member of Adibi’s
   researcher group, also contributed to the platform development
   (published earlier). This work was primarily funded by the Air Force
   Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) under grant number
   FA9550-15-1-0342 (G. Pomrenke).
