Red Lentil Hummus

   Red Lentil Hummus || Local Haven Red Lentil Hummus || Local Haven

   For those of you who follow me on Instagram you know I have a slight
   obsession with hummus. Well, all dips really. But hummus has a special
   place in my heart (stomach) after spending many days set with Chef Sam
   Smith of Tusk. This hummus however has a spin on the classic version.
   Instead of using chickpeas, this version uses another pulse, red
   lentils. Inspired by one of my favorite photographers and recipe
   writers, Heidi Swanson, but using the process steps from Sam, who makes
   the world's creamiest hummus.

   In the end, the biggest key to very, very smooth hummus is to truly let
   your food processor or high-speed blender go for 3-5 minutes. You want
   the hummus to be slightly loose, and then let set in a bowl over ice
   until it thickens. And then there is the toppings. There are countless
   toppings that you can add on your hummus. From chickpeas to handfuls of
   herbs, meats, seasonal vegetables, allepo pepper, nuts, spices, and
   plenty of olive oil to drizzle over top.

   Red Lentil Hummus
   makes 3 cups

   INGREDIENTS:
   2 1/2 cups cooked red lentils
   2 medium cloves garlic
   3 tablespoons rice vinegar (or lemon juice)
   2/3 cup tahini
   3/4 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
   2 to 3 tablespoons ice water (if needed)
   Extra virgin olive oil

   Toppings:
   pink peppercorns
   sesame seeds
   za'atar seasoning
   chives
   chive blossoms
   cumin

   PROCESS:
   1. Rinse 1 1/2 cups dried red lentils well and place in a saucepan
   topped with water 2" over the lentils. Bring to a boil, and then reduce
   to a medium simmer. After 10 minutes check for doneness. Once cooked
   through, strain and set aside to cool. I like to cook my grains and
   pulses like pasta, instead of doing a ratio system.
   2. Add the cooked lentils and garlic to a food processor and pulse for
   2 minutes.
   3. Add the rice vinegar, tahini and sea salt. Blend again for another 3
   minutes.
   4. If needed add ice water and continue to blend until the hummus is
   smooth and light. At this point its ok if it looks thinner than normal,
   as well your machine will feel warm for running for so long.
   5. Taste, and adjust to your liking â€” adding more rice vinegar or salt,
   if needed. Fill a large bowl with ice water, and then fill your hummus
   into a medium bowl, and put the hummus bowl into the ice water. This
   allows the hummus to cool and thicken.
   6. Serve topped with the sesame seeds, seasonings, fresh herbs, and
   plenty of olive oil.
