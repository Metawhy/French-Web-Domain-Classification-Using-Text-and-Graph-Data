About EMERG

   The European Mediterranean Regulators Group (EMERG) was established on
   July 1, 2008 in Malta, as an independent platform of National
   Regulatory Authorities for Electronic Communications Networks and
   Services.

   The origin of EMERG lays in the ideals and principles of the
   Euro-Mediterranean cooperation set out in the Barcelona Declaration of
   November 28, 1995, which establishes the principles of a partnership
   aimed to turn the Mediterranean region into a common area of peace,
   stability and prosperity by way of the reinforcement of the political
   dialogue and of cooperation in security and economic, financial, social
   and cultural matters.

   The EMERG’s activities are currently funded by the European Commission
   through the “New Approaches to Telecommunications Project” (NATP-4)

   CHARTER OF THE EUROPEAN MEDITERRANEAN REGULATORS GROUP (EMERG)

   EMERG (15) 10_EMERG Charter_adopted

Objectives

   According to its Charter, the objectives of EMERG are the following:
     * To act as a forum for regular discussions and exchanges of
       information for its Members on issues relating to electronic
       communications;
     * To promote the approximation to the European regulatory framework
       and best practices among its Members;
     * To monitor the development of the electronic communications in the
       Mediterranean area;
     * To facilitate the cooperation and exchange of ideas and expertise
       with international organizations, other regulatory networks and
       sector experts;
     * To prepare and contribute to the preparation of a region’s
       reservoir of documents, reports, benchmarks, presentations,
       analyses and common positions.

Members

   EMERG is open to any National Regulatory Authority (NRA) concerned with
   the electronic communications sector that is member of or observer in
   the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC)
   or party to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched within the
   framework of the Barcelona Declaration of November 28, 1995 and/or to
   the ENP-South countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy.

   Currently, EMERG is integrated by the NRAs of 23 countries: Algeria,
   Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, France,
   Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco,
   State of Palestine, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tunisia and
   Turkey.

EMERG Benchmarking Report

   Yearly, EMERG publishes its “Report on Market Trends and Benchmarking
   Regulatory Activities” (the Benchmark Report). The Benchmark Report
   aims at comparing the regulatory environment and market outcomes of the
   telecom sector amongst the EMERG Members. The Report is prepared on the
   basis of a questionnaire on all the key issues at stake for EMERG
   following the new scenarios and the new challenges in the electronic
   communication sector.

International cooperation

   EMERG is fully committed to develop an active cooperation policy with
   other entities, namely other regulators’ groups, policy makers and
   international institutions dealing with electronic communications
   matters.

   The close cooperation with BEREC, the Board of European Regulators, is
   a key-driver element for EMERG. It was materialized in 2014 with the
   signature of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Under this umbrella,
   every yearly EMERG and BEREC organize a workshop together on a subject
   that falls into both groups’ interest. The MoU has been renewed in
   2017, considering the common interest to reinforce  collaboration as
   fruitful for the EMERG Countries approximation to the EU framework
   objective and to widen the EMERG audience also beyond the Mediterranean
   basin.

   EMERG also promotes the establishment of contacts with other regional
   associations and platforms of regulators, such as the Union for the
   Mediterranean (UfM), REGULATEL (Latin American Forum of
   Telecommunications Regulators) and the EaP (Eastern European Countries
   Partnership).

   Finally, every year EMERG actively participates at the Regulatory
   Associations Meeting (RA), organized during the Global Symposium of
   Regulators by the ITU.
