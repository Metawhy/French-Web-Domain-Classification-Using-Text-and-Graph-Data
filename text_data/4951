"Sent from Heaven" easy pop-up card for G45

   Hello guys,
   A lot of cuteness and softness on my blog today.
   I love to make baby-cards
   because there are no better baby collections
   than Graphic 45 collections.
   This time I've used
   "Little Darlings"
   which is definitely one of my fave baby collection ever!

I've got inspired! vol.1

   Hi guys,
   How are you doing today?
   One of the biggest inspirations beside my crafty friends
   is PINTEREST.
   Everything inspires me there and it's almost
   dangerous for me to open it, if you know what I mean ;)
   Minutes becoming hours and sometimes I feel
   like my head what to explode because of all ideas.
   Today I bring you first of five cards inspired by Pinterest:
   [70978843_727037127760578_5623656583394230272_n.jpg]
   [71516224_742243802918373_7756376586256908288_n.jpg]
   [70601476_547335722739339_332579130413416448_n.jpg]
   [70374935_1408716895976722_6454256761124683776_n.jpg]
    And this is the picture which got me inspired:

   Another amazing inspiration through my crafty adventures
   is my dear friend Ivana.
   She is an amazing person and a talented artist.
   Stop by her BLOG and INSTAGRAM to say Hi :)
   Thank you so much for stopping by
   and have a great day!
