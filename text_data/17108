Cookies

   To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files
   called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.

What are cookies?

   A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or
   mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to
   remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font
   size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t
   have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or
   browse from one page to another.

How do we use cookies?

   Adjust this part of the page according to your needs. Explain which
   cookies you use in plain, jargon-free language. In particular:
     * their purpose and the reason why they are being used, (e.g. to
       remember users' actions, to identify the user, for online
       behavioural advertising)
     * if they are essential for the website or a given functionality to
       work or if they aim to enhance the performance of the website
     * the types of cookies used (e.g. session or permanent, first or
       third-party)
     * who controls/accesses the cookie-related information (website or
       third party)
     * that the cookie will not be used for any purpose other than the one
       stated
     * how consent can be withdrawn.

Example:

     A number of our pages use cookies to remember:
     * your display preferences, such as contrast colour settings or font
       size
     * if you have already replied to a survey pop-up that asks you if the
       content was helpful or not (so you won't be asked again)
     * if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this site

     Also, some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously
     gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.

     Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to
     work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience. You
     can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that some features
     of this site may not work as intended.

     The cookie-related information is not used to identify you
     personally and the pattern data is fully under our control. These
     cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described
     here.

How to control cookies

   You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see
   aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies that are already on your
   computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being
   placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some
   preferences every time you visit a site and some services and
   functionalities may not work.
