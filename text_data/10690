Meltdown and Spectre

   Vulnerabilities in modern computers leak passwords and sensitive data.

   Meltdown and Spectre exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern
   processors. These hardware vulnerabilities allow programs to steal data
   which is currently processed on the computer. While programs are
   typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a malicious
   program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored
   in the memory of other running programs. This might include your
   passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal
   photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.

   Meltdown and Spectre work on personal computers, mobile devices, and in
   the cloud. Depending on the cloud provider's infrastructure, it might
   be possible to steal data from other customers.

                                  Meltdown

Meltdown

   Meltdown breaks the most fundamental isolation between user
   applications and the operating system. This attack allows a program to
   access the memory, and thus also the secrets, of other programs and the
   operating system.

   If your computer has a vulnerable processor and runs an unpatched
   operating system, it is not safe to work with sensitive information
   without the chance of leaking the information. This applies both to
   personal computers as well as cloud infrastructure. Luckily, there are
   software patches against Meltdown.

Spectre

   Spectre breaks the isolation between different applications. It allows
   an attacker to trick error-free programs, which follow best practices,
   into leaking their secrets. In fact, the safety checks of said best
   practices actually increase the attack surface and may make
   applications more susceptible to Spectre

   Spectre is harder to exploit than Meltdown, but it is also harder to
   mitigate. However, it is possible to prevent specific known exploits
   based on Spectre through software patches.

Who reported Meltdown?

   Meltdown was independently discovered and reported by three teams:
     * Jann Horn (Google Project Zero),
     * Werner Haas, Thomas Prescher (Cyberus Technology),
     * Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Michael Schwarz (Graz
       University of Technology)

Who reported Spectre?

   Spectre was independently discovered and reported by two people:
     * Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) and
     * Paul Kocher in collaboration with, in alphabetical order, Daniel
       Genkin (University of Pennsylvania and University of Maryland),
       Mike Hamburg (Rambus), Moritz Lipp (Graz University of Technology),
       and Yuval Yarom (University of Adelaide and Data61)

Questions & Answers

Am I affected by the vulnerability?

   Most certainly, yes.

Can I detect if someone has exploited Meltdown or Spectre against me?

   Probably not. The exploitation does not leave any traces in traditional
   log files.

Can my antivirus detect or block this attack?

   While possible in theory, this is unlikely in practice. Unlike usual
   malware, Meltdown and Spectre are hard to distinguish from regular
   benign applications. However, your antivirus may detect malware which
   uses the attacks by comparing binaries after they become known.

What can be leaked?

   If your system is affected, our proof-of-concept exploit can read the
   memory content of your computer. This may include passwords and
   sensitive data stored on the system.

Has Meltdown or Spectre been abused in the wild?

   We don't know.

Is there a workaround/fix?

   There are patches against Meltdown for Linux ( KPTI (formerly KAISER)),
   Windows, and OS X. There is also work to harden software against future
   exploitation of Spectre, respectively to patch software after
   exploitation through Spectre ( LLVM patch, MSVC, ARM speculation
   barrier header).

Which systems are affected by Meltdown?

   Desktop, Laptop, and Cloud computers may be affected by Meltdown. More
   technically, every Intel processor which implements out-of-order
   execution is potentially affected, which is effectively every processor
   since 1995 (except Intel Itanium and Intel Atom before 2013). We
   successfully tested Meltdown on Intel processor generations released as
   early as 2011. Currently, we have only verified Meltdown on Intel
   processors. At the moment, it is unclear whether AMD processors are
   also affected by Meltdown. According to ARM, some of their processors
   are also affected.

Which systems are affected by Spectre?

   Almost every system is affected by Spectre: Desktops, Laptops, Cloud
   Servers, as well as Smartphones. More specifically, all modern
   processors capable of keeping many instructions in flight are
   potentially vulnerable. In particular, we have verified Spectre on
   Intel, AMD, and ARM processors.

Which cloud providers are affected by Meltdown?

   Cloud providers which use Intel CPUs and Xen PV as virtualization
   without having patches applied. Furthermore, cloud providers without
   real hardware virtualization, relying on containers that share one
   kernel, such as Docker, LXC, or OpenVZ are affected.

What is the difference between Meltdown and Spectre?

   Meltdown breaks the mechanism that keeps applications from accessing
   arbitrary system memory. Consequently, applications can access system
   memory. Spectre tricks other applications into accessing arbitrary
   locations in their memory. Both attacks use side channels to obtain the
   information from the accessed memory location. For a more technical
   discussion we refer to the papers ( Meltdown and Spectre)

Why is it called Meltdown?

   The vulnerability basically melts security boundaries which are
   normally enforced by the hardware.

Why is it called Spectre?

   The name is based on the root cause, speculative execution. As it is
   not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time.

Is there more technical information about Meltdown and Spectre?

   Yes, there is an academic paper and a blog post about Meltdown, and an
   academic paper about Spectre. Furthermore, there is a Google Project
   Zero blog entry about both attacks.

What are CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715?

   CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 are the official references to Spectre.
   CVE is the Standard for Information Security Vulnerability Names
   maintained by MITRE.

What is the CVE-2017-5754?

   CVE-2017-5754 is the official reference to Meltdown. CVE is the
   Standard for Information Security Vulnerability Names maintained by
   MITRE.
