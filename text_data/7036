I don't trust....

   [calm.png]

"I DON’T TRUST THE TRUTH OF MEMORIES
BECAUSE WHAT LEAVES US
DEPARTS FOREVER
THERE’S ONLY ONE CURRENT OF THIS SACRED RIVER
BUT I STILL WANT TO REMAIN FAITHFUL
TO MY FIRST ASTONISHMENTS
TO RECOGNIZE AS WISDOM THE CHILD’S WONDER
AND TO CARRY IN MYSELF UNTIL THE END A PATH
IN THE WOODS OF MY CHILDHOOD
DAPPLED WITH PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT
TO SEARCH FOR IT EVERYWHERE
IN MUSEUMS IN THE SHADE OF CHURCHES
THIS PATH ON WHICH I RAN UNAWARE
A SIX-YEAR OLD
TOWARD MY PRIMARY MYSTERIOUS ALONENESS"

   ~   Anna Kamieńska, from “A Path in the Woods,“Astonishments: Selected
   Poems of Anna Kamieńska, eds & trans. Grazyna Drabik and David Curzon
   (Paraclete Press, 2007)

   that I am not.
