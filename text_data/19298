CCS Activities in Australia

   CSLF-Recognized Projects
     * CarbonNet Project
     * CO2CRC Otway Project
     * CO2CRC Otway Project, Stage 2
     * Gorgon Carbon Dioxide (CO[2]) Injection Project
     * South West Hub Project

   CCS activities in Australia currently include pilot, demonstration, and
   commercial scale projects at various stages of implementation;
   finalization of legislation and regulations for CO[2] storage; and
   various state, federal, and international programs and funds to
   accelerate CCS development and deployment.

   The Australian Federal Government, as well as the State governments of
   Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia, have passed legislation and
   regulations enabling the geological storage of CO[2], both offshore and
   onshore Australia. Legislation is being developed by New South Wales
   and Western Australia for those states’ onshore areas. The Australian
   Government is supporting a number of significant CCS initiatives
   including:
     * CCS Flagships – The CCS Flagships program provides support for the
       accelerated deployment of industrial scale CCS demonstration
       projects. Projects developed under this funding will form part of
       Australia’s contribution to the G8’s goal of 20 large scale CCS
       projects being operational world wide by 2020. Two projects are
       currently being supported for feasibility stage work under the CCS
       Flagships Program: the CarbonNet Project and the South West Hub
       project, discussed below.
     * National Low Emissions Coal Initiative (NLECI) – The NLECI fosters
       the development and deployment of low emission coal technologies to
       reduce emissions from coal use.
     * National CO[2] Infrastructure Plan (NCIP) – The NCIP complements
       the pre-competitive data acquisition activities under the NLECI
       program to identify and secure adequate storage.
     * Global CCS Institute - The Global CCS Institute was established by
       the Australian Government in 2009 with a mandate of helping to
       address the barriers to the commercial deployment of CCS through
       fact-based advocacy and knowledge sharing activities. Since its
       incorporation in 2009, the Global CCS Institute has attracted
       widespread support from governments, corporations, industry bodies,
       companies and research organisations located within key markets
       around the world. It has built a diversified membership profile
       with 361 members as at November 2012, representing a robust
       cross-section of these international stakeholders.
     * In July 2012, the Institute released a draft Five Year Strategic
       Plan to its members. The draft Plan outlines the Institute’s
       strategic objectives and highlights the need to diversify its
       funding sources, including through membership fees. The Strategic
       Plan is currently being revised and finalised in response to member
       feedback.

   Other Australian Government CCS initiatives include:
     * The Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies
       (CO2CRC) develops and manages a collaborative partnership between
       industry, government and university partners and is one of the
       world’s leading collaborative research institutions specializing in
       CCS. Since 1998, CO2CRC has undertaken Australia’s only operational
       storage project in the Otway (Victoria). There are also both pre-
       and post-combustion capture projects under way.
     * The Australian Low Emissions Coal Research and Development Ltd
       (ANLEC R&D) is the seven year research program in support of CCS
       R&D with a particular focus on the development of the CSS
       Flagships. The coal industry matches the Australian Government
       contribution.
     * Release of offshore and onshore areas for exploration for GHG
       storage formations. In March 2009, the Australian Government
       released 10 offshore areas for exploration for commercial
       geological GHG storage sites. On 13 January 2012 an assessment
       permit was granted to the CarbonNet Flagship project, which is
       currently managed through the Victorian Department of State
       Development, Business and Innovation.
     * The National CCS Council, which comprises members drawn from the
       power-generation, coal and petroleum sectors, provides advice to
       the Australian Government.

CCS Project Actitives

Advanced Integrated CCS Projects

   Callide Oxyfuel Project (Callide ‘A’) – Queensland, Australia. This
   demonstration project will capture up to 30,000 tonnes per annum of
   CO[2] from anoxyfuelretrofit to a 30 MWeblack coal-fired power station.
   This project is being developed through an Australia-Japan technology
   alliance. In early 2012, the retrofitted power station operated on
   oxyfiring mode. The capture plant became operational in late 2012 and
   the project is now undergoing operational testing.
   http://www.callideoxyfuel.com

   The Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection Project – Western Australia,
   Australia. At an expected injection rate of 3.1Mt/a over the life of
   the Gorgon project, the CO[2] injection component is set to be the
   largest commercial carbon dioxide storage project in the world.
   Operated by Chevron Australia, the Gorgon project draws reservoir gas
   from formations in Commonwealth waters some 130 km off the Western
   Australian coast. Expected to process 15 Mt/a of LNG, the reservoir gas
   is stripped from the natural gas, conditioned and transported by
   pipeline to Barrow island for injection in a deep saline formation.
   Final investment decision for the project was in September 2009 with
   LNG production expected in 2014. Injection of CO[2] should commence
   around 12 months after LNG production starts. The CO[2] injection
   project is regulated under the Barrow Island Act 2003.

CO[2] Hubs and Networks

   The CarbonNet Project aims to capture, condition and transport 3 to 5
   Mt/a of CO[2] from industries and energy producers in the Latrobe
   Valley via pipeline for sequestration in the offshore Gippsland basin.
   The CarbonNet CCS project was awarded Flagship status and a total of
   $100 million from the Commonwealth and Victorian governments to
   progress the project through its feasibility stage. The combined
   funding ($70 million from the Commonwealth and $30 million from the
   Victorian Government) will identify suitable storage locations, capture
   options, and the transport pipeline, with a view to developing more
   accurate cost estimates. Work will also be undertaken to develop a
   detailed assessment of the commercial, financial and economic
   dimensions of the Project, and include consideration of the Project’s
   regulatory requirements and a business model to optimise private sector
   investment. The CO2CRC is the nominated lead research organization for
   CarbonNet and was awarded approximately $50 million from the Federal
   Government’s Education Innovation Fund for setting up CCS research
   infrastructure that can be applied to CCS and the CarbonNet Project in
   particular.

   storage/the-carbonnet-project

   The South West Hub CO[2] Geosequestration Project currently underway in
   Western Australia’s South West to examine the potential for CCS in the
   region and for CO[2] storage in the Lesueur Formation, north of
   Kemerton industrial area. The area has the potential to be developed as
   a storage hub for CO[2] from surrounding industry, including coal-fired
   power plants. The project developers aim to store up to 3.3 mega tonnes
   of carbon dioxide per annum. The CO[2] would be transported 80 km by
   pipeline and stored 2-3 km deep in the Lesueur Sandstone in the
   southern Perth Basin. Project operation is expected in 2015. In June
   2011, the project received $52M in funding as part of the CCS Flagships
   program, which has enabled the project to move to the next phase of
   decision making which includes the progression pre-competitive data
   acquisition and analysis of the potential storage area. The assessment
   for suitable storage space has been completed with the drilling of a
   stratigraphic well in the region to better understand the subsurface
   geology. The South West Hub project was awarded CCS Flagsips status and
   in addition to Australian government support via Flagships, it is a
   government-industry partnership between the WA Department of Mines and
   Petroleum, Griffin Energy, Verve Energy, BHP Billiton Worsley Alumina,
   Wesfarmers Premier Coal, Perdaman Chemicals and Fertilizers, and Alcoa
   Australia. The work follows a preliminary investigation by the
   Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC),
   which identified the southern Perth Basin as having potential for CCS.
   WAERA (Western Australian Energy Resources Alliance — a collaboration
   between CSIRO, the University of Western Australia andCurtin
   University) was awarded funding from the Federal government from the
   Education Infrastructure Fund (EIF) to purchase research equipment and
   assets related to CCS and specifically theSW Hub
   project. http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/9514.aspx

Current CCS Pilot-scale Activities

   Alcoa Kwinana Carbonation Plant – WA, AustraliaKwinana Alumina Refinery
   utilises 70,000 t/a of CO[2] from a nearby ammonia plant in a residue
   carbonation process mixing bauxite residue with CO[2]. It has been
   operational since April 2007. Shutdown is planned for 2019.

   Latrobe Valley PCC project – Victoria, Australia. &A CSIRO mobile pilot
   PCC facility designed to capture approximately 1,000 t/a of CO[2] was
   installed at Loy Yang A power station. This project aims to review the
   technical and economic viability of commercial use of PCC for brown
   coal power stations, by benchmarking existing and new solvents,
   obtaining a validated model description of the system and realistic
   efficiency rates. Operational since May2008.
   http://www.csiro.au/news/CarbonDioxideCapture.html

   Delta Electricity Project – The project supports a feasibility study
   for a medium-scale CCS project involving the retrofit of
   post-combustion capture technology to an existing coal-fired power
   station. Vales Point has been selected as the most appropriate
   location. This study is linked in with geological storage assessment in
   New South Wales (NSW), a NSW Government Initiative. The Delta
   Electricity Project builds upon a pilot scale CCS project by Delta at
   the Munmorah Power
   Station. http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Energy/Energy-from-coal/Post-comb
   ustion-capture/Demonstrating-PCC.aspx

   CO2CRC Otway Project Stage 1 & 2 – Victoria, Australia.  During Stage 1
   of the project (in 2008 and 2009), approximately 65,000 tons of CO[2]
   was injected into a depleted gas field at approximately 2,000 meters
   depth. This first stage of the project tested modelling prediction,
   capacity estimation, containment and monitoring technologies. During
   Stage 2A of the project, residual trapping was evaluated in asaline
   formation following a testinjection in 2011. The Otway Project Stage 2B
   residual gas saturation test has been successfully completed. After
   eleven weeks of continuous operations, the remaining formation water
   was pumped back into the formation, concluding a sequence of hydraulic
   pressure, tracer, thermal, residual saturation and dissolution
   tests. http://www.co2crc.com.au/otway/

   CO2CRC UNO MK 3 – Victoria, Australia (Completed). CO2CRC has developed
   a precipitating solvent process using potassium carbonate (K2CO3),
   which gives it many advantages over the conventional amine processes
   currently used to separate CO[2] during natural gas processing,
   including significantly lower energy use, lower overall costs and a
   range of environmental benefits.The system is being trialled at the
   GDF-SUEZ Australian Energy Hazelwood power station in Victoria using a
   one tonne per day capture plant. The trials are validating UNO MK 3 for
   large-scale CO[2] capture and will inform a projected 50 tonne per day
   plant — the next step in scaling up the
   technology. http://www.co2crc.com.au/research/uno_mk3_process.html

   CO2CRC H3 Capture Project – Victoria, Australia (Completed). Three
   capture technologies were under evaluation at Hazelwood Power Station,
   with a view to reduce the technical risk and cost of post-combustion
   capture: solvent, membrane separation and vacuum swing adsorption.
   Testing started in 2009 and the project has now been
   completed. http://www.co2crc.com.au/research/demo_precombustion.html

   CO2CRC/HRL Mulgrave Capture Project – Victoria, Australia (Completed).
   The research program at Mulgrave aimed at assessing and optimizing
   pre-combustion capture technologies (solvent absorption, membrane
   separation, and pressure swing adsorption) by evaluating the impact of
   gas contaminants (H[2]S, CH[4], CO) and water; optimizing operating
   parameters; developing engineering solutions; assessing energy
   integration options; reviewing technical and economic viability for
   commercial use. Tests started in 2009. This project has now been
   completed. http://www.co2crc.com.au/research/demo_precombustion.html

   International Power Carbon Capture Plant– Victoria, Australia. The
   pilot capture project was launched in 2009 to trial capture
   technologies for brown coal power generation. The plant captured up to
   25 tonnes of CO[2] per day, which was then used to treat the power
   station’s ash water and produce a calcium carbonate by-product and
   reduce the pH of the ash water. It represents the biggest capture plant
   attached to a power station in Australia.

   Brazil Flag In the sector of oil and gas Petrobras has been using CO[2]
   injection in mature onshore fields in northeast Brazil for enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) purposes since the early 80s. More recently, for the
   offshore pre-salt Santos Basin development, the company has voluntarily
   committed to avoiding CO[2] venting to the atmosphere in natural gas
   production operations. In 2013 Petrobras and its partners have started
   offshore EOR CO[2] injection at Lula oil field, located in the Santos
   Basin ca. 300 kilometers of Rio de Janeiro coast.

   The technical challenges related to the offshore production of high
   CO[2] content natural gas, encompassing separation processes and CO[2]
   reinjection in the pre-salt layer, are addressed by several R&D
   projects carried out by Petrobras and technical partners, such as local
   academy in Brazil, as well as technology developers both at the
   national and international scenarios.

   From 2006 to 2015, the Company has invested more than US$ 115 million
   in 2 corporate programs (EMISSÕES and PRO-CO[2]) tailored to curb
   overall atmospheric emissions, as well as providing CO[2] management
   best practices for the company´s production and operational facilities.

   This has been accomplished at the national level by engaging in
   technical partnership with the Brazilian Academy, by means of “The
   Carbon Sequestration and Climate Change Thematic Network," encompassing
   15 domestic institutions, with more than 53 projects currently at their
   implementation phase (around US$ 18 million invested in 2006 to 2015).
   One example of infrastructure established through the Carbon
   Sequestration and Climate Change Network is CEPAC (Center of Excellence
   in Research and Innovation in Petroleum, Mineral Resources and Carbon
   Storage), collaboration between Petrobras and the Pontifical Catholic
   University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUC-RS).

   Another important initiative is the establishment of Rio de Janeiro
   Federal University Excellence Natural Gas Center, totally sponsored by
   Petrobras, which is the largest of its kind in Latin America. The
   laboratories and pilot plants were tailored to perform experimental
   studies to assess CO[2] separation processes from the natural gas
   coming from the pre-salt oil fields, as well as CO[2] separation from
   the flue gas.

   At the international level, PETROBRAS has adhered to several JIP’s
   covering themes relevant to CCS value chain. One of these being “The
   Carbon Capture Project” (CCP), which main goal is to encourage and
   support the development of next generation technologies likely to
   contribute to increasing cost-effectiveness, as well as helping to
   establish CCS on a world scale as a reliable and expedite CO[2]
   emissions reduction strategy for the fossil energy sector. In 2015, The
   Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) granted CCP international
   recognition for its pioneering work in CCS.

   Other important achievement covering CO[2] capture technologies from
   exhaust gas also have taken place, highlighting the development of the
   first PETROBRAS pre-industrial scale Oxy-combustion Technology
   Development for Fluid Catalytic Crackers (FCC). It is a pioneer,
   unprecedented initiative on a world basis, with promising prospects,
   both in terms of costs and emissions abatement. Data from the latest
   tests suggest that the oxy-combustion process could capture at least
   90% of the CO[2] emitted from industrial plants. And it is likely to
   correspond to at least 40% savings in terms of global costs, when
   compared to post-combustion technology.

   The Company has also sponsored the development of field laboratories
   dedicated to technology deployment and assessment, covering CO[2]
   Monitoring and Verification. An on-going R&D Project, carried out by
   CENPES experts and local academy representatives from 5 research groups
   in Brazil, is the start-up and development of the Brazilian CO[2] Pilot
   Project. Currently entering its second phase, this field lab is the
   first of its kind in Latin America. Fully sponsored by PETROBRAS, it is
   100% dedicated to testing multiple CO[2] MMV techniques, with a long
   term goal of enabling the ranking of the best, most cost-effective MMV
   technology alternatives to be further deployed at commercial large
   scale CCS sites scheduled to be installed in the country.

   Amongst PETROBRAS accomplishments in CO[2] dedicated technology
   development, recently bestowed in the 2015 Offshore Technology
   Conference (OTC), the highlights in CO[2] separation are: “ First
   separation of CO[2] associated with natural gas in ultra-deep waters
   (2,140 m)”, by injecting CO[2] into production reservoirs (around 2MM
   ton CO[2] at Santos Basin), and “Deepest CO[2] gas injection well
   (water depth of 2,200 m).”

   Specifically about carbon capture for coal sector, the Beneficent
   Association of Santa Catarina Coal Industry (SATC) and Brazilian Coal
   Association (ABCM) have worked hard since 2011 in projects to stablish
   low cost technologies for carbon capture. Around 3 million dollars has
   been applied in laboratory infrastructure (building of the first CO[2]
   capture lab in the Latin America), synthesis of new sorbents (zeolites
   and enriched amines) using coal byproducts as fly ash, pilot plant
   facilities and capacity building projects. A pilot plant using a CO[2]
   capture process based on the temperature swing adsorption has been
   designed to start the operation in 2018. Zeolites and enriched amines
   will be tested. A partnership with important institutions and companies
   as US-Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory
   (NETL), Adsorption Research Inc. (ARI), Pontifical Catholic University
   of Rio Grande do Sul (PUC-RS), Federal University of Santa Catarina
   (UFSC) it has given velocity in the development of the technology.

   Canada is a global leader in carbon capture, utilization, and storage
   (CCUS), with 3 of the world’s 15 currently operational large-scale
   projects. As an important part of the effort to protect the environment
   and develop the country’s economy and energy resources in a responsible
   manner, Canada is active in CCUS research, development, and
   demonstration (RD&D) at the national and provincial levels. Over the
   last number of years, Canada’s federal and provincial governments have
   committed more than $1.8 billion in funding for CCUS projects, with
   significant additional investments leveraged from the private sector.
   These investments support several interdependent initiatives focusing
   on reducing market barriers and realizing the full potential of CCUS
   technology.

   Through Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), the Government of Canada is
   pursuing innovative cutting-edge CCUS RD&D both internally and with
   external partners. The Office of Energy Research and Development (OERD)
   is the Government of Canada’s coordinator of energy research and
   development (R&D) activities, including for government investments in
   CCUS. Through its CanmetENERGY Laboratories, the research arm of NRCan,
   Canada is supporting bench and pilot-scale CCUS R&D with particular
   emphasis on step-change carbon capture technologies to significantly
   reduce energy and cost penalties associated with CCUS. Major
   investments have been directed towards the establishment of an
   integrated R&D platform to cover the entire CCUS chain to better
   understand the integration of multiple technologies. Special large
   pilot-scale facilities are being built to investigate the potential of
   various high-pressure oxy-combustion technologies to improve the
   overall efficiency of CCUS systems.

   Canada is also addressing CCUS issues in the international arena
   through multilateral organizations such as the International Energy
   Agency (IEA), the Carbon Capture, Use and Storage Action Group of the
   Clean Energy Ministerial (CCUS AG), the Canada-U.S. Clean Energy
   Dialogue, and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF). This
   also includes projects such as the trilateral Canada-USA-Mexico North
   American Carbon Storage Atlas, an atlas of major CO[2] sources,
   potential CO[2] storage reservoirs and storage estimates in the three
   countries. In addition, Canada is a participating member of Mission
   Innovation, a global partnership of 21 major economies aimed at
   reinvigorating and accelerating clean energy innovation — including in
   CCUS — with the objective of making clean energy widely affordable.

   Weyburn-Midale Project – Saskatchewan
   The Weyburn Field operated by Cenovus Energy has been injecting CO[2]
   as part of an ongoing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operation since
   October 2000. The adjacent Midale Field, operated by Apache Canada,
   began CO[2] injection in 2005. Combined, about 2.8 megatonnes (Mt) per
   year of anthropogenic CO[2] originating from the Great Plains Synfuels
   Plant (coal gasification) in North Dakota, USA, is transported by
   pipeline 320 km across the Canadian border and injected into these
   depleting oil fields. CO[2] produced along with the oil is recycled and
   re-injected into the reservoirs, meaning over 5 Mt per year of CO[2] is
   injected annually into these fields (recycled and new CO[2] directly
   from the Great Plains Synfuels).

   In addition, Weyburn-Midale hosted the 12-year IEA GHG Weyburn-Midale
   CO[2] Monitoring and Storage Project. Twelve years of research on
   measurement and monitoring of CO[2] in the Weyburn and Midale oilfields
   culminated with the publication of Best Practices for Validating CO[2]
   Geological Storage (Geosciences Publishing, 2012), a definitive guide
   for jurisdictions and companies thinking of storing CO[2] underground.
   In addition, a special technical edition of the International Journal
   of Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies was published in 2013 with
   technical results from the project, as a companion to the Best
   Practices Manual.

   Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Storage Project –
   Saskatchewan
   Constructed and operated by SaskPower, a publicly owned utility in the
   province of Saskatchewan, the Boundary Dam ICCS Demonstration Project
   is one of the world’s first and largest carbon capture and storage
   (CCS) facilities and the first to combine CCUS with commercial scale
   coal-fired generation. This project has transformed an aging coal-fired
   unit at the Boundary Dam Power Station into a clean, reliable, and
   long-term producer of 115 megawatts of base-load electricity, capable
   of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as one million tonnes
   per year. The CO[2] captured from the Boundary Dam Project will be used
   both for enhanced oil recovery and to further deep saline storage
   research through the adjacent Aquistore Project. Monthly performance
   updates on the project can be found at
   http://saskpowerccs.com/newsandmedia/latest-news/.

   Quest CO[2] Capture and Storage Project – Alberta
   The Quest project is the world’s first large-scale CCS project at a
   bitumen upgrader. This project will store up to 1 Mt per year of CO[2]
   captured from Shell’s Scotford Upgrader in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta,
   which turns bitumen from Canada’s oil sands into synthetic crude. This
   project is expected to reduce CO[2] emissions by 1 million tonnes each
   year and is operated as a joint venture between Shell Canada (60
   percent), Chevron Canada (20 percent), and Marathon Oil Sands L.P. (20
   percent). Following testing in early 2015, when 200,000 tonnes of CO[2]
   were successfully captured and stored, commercial operations began in
   November 2015. A number of knowledge sharing reports have been made
   public and can be found on the Government of Alberta’s website at
   http://www.energy.alberta.ca/CCS/3848.asp.

   Alberta Carbon Trunk Line (ACTL) – Alberta
   With commercial operations expected to begin in 2017, the Alberta
   Carbon Trunk Line is a pipeline infrastructure that will connect
   Alberta’s industrial heartland with world-class storage and enhanced
   oil recovery commercial opportunities within the province. The pipeline
   infrastructure has the potential to transport and store up to 15 Mt of
   CO[2] per year, with 1.8 MT per year of confirmed initial sources,
   including an Agrium fertilizer plant as well as the  North West
   Redwater bitumen refinery, currently under construction in Alberta. The
   captured CO[2] will be transported via a 240 km pipeline to mature oil
   reservoirs in central Alberta, where it will be injected for enhanced
   oil recovery purposes and permanent
   sequestration. http://www.enhanceenergy.com

Research and Development Projects

   Aquistore – Saskatchewan
   Aquistore is among the first projects in Canada to demonstrate CO[2]
   injection and storage within a deep saline geological formation.
   Managed by the Petroleum Technology Research Centre (PTRC), the project
   will be partnered with SaskPower’s Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon
   Capture and Storage Demonstration Project. Aquistore will receive CO[2]
   from SaskPower via pipeline. The CO[2] will then be injected to a depth
   of 3.4 km. In 2012, a permanent seismic array and baseline 3D seismic
   surveys at the injection site were installed. Both the injection and
   observation wells were drilled to depths of 3396 m and 3400 m
   respectively. These heavily instrumented wells are currently providing
   valuable geologic knowledge and data for the project’s monitoring,
   measurement, and verification (MMV) program.

   SaskPower Carbon Capture Test Facility – Saskatchewan

   provides a robust evaluation of the energy demand, collection
   efficiency, long-term stability, operability, maintainability, and
   reliability of amine based, post-combustion technologies. Construction
   of the new $60 million facility began in the spring of 2013, and the
   facility opened in June 2015. Through a collaboration agreement,
   Hitachi Ltd supported the facility design, provided certain core
   equipment, and was the first to proceed with demonstration testing at
   the facility. The facility has a flexible design to accommodate a wide
   range of solvents and has capacity to add or remove process equipment,
   change configuration of vessel internals, and even expand the height of
   the key absorber vessel if needed in the future. Along with the
   physical facility, SaskPower is establishing technical support capacity
   for post-combustion capture technologies. After initial demonstration
   testing by Hitachi Ltd, the CCTF will provide a unique platform where

   France's Flag CCS is considered as a high-potential technology to
   accelerate the reduction of CO[2] emissions from both fossil-fuelled
   power plants and other industrial emitters. France invests in the
   development and deployment of CCS within a holistic approach ranging
   from technical and financial issues to regulation and public
   consultation. Further information on different aspects of France’s CCS
   commitment can be found below:

CCS in France – A holistic approach bringing together public, academic and
private players

   CSLF-Recognized Projects
     * Carbon Dioxide Geologic Storage (CGS) Europe Project (Project
       Completed)
     * Lacq Carbon Dioxide (CO[2]) Capture and Storage Project (Project
       Completed)

   France is committed to act against climate change with an objective of
   reducing its GHG emissions by a factor of 4 by 2050 with developments
   dedicated to energy efficiency and the deployment of low-carbon energy
   solutions. CO[2] capture, transport and storage (CCS) is considered as
   a high potential technology to accelerate the reduction of CO[2]
   emissions from both fossil-fuel power plants and other industrial
   emitters.

   France has been investing in CCS since the early 2000’s. This effort
   covers the entire capture-to-storage chain, from academic research to
   industrial implementation. Public, academic and private players work
   together on the development and the deployment of the technologies
   within a holistic approach ranging from technical and financial issues
   to regulation and public consultation. The use of CO[2] as an
   alternative solution to storage is also considered.

   International cooperation and knowledge sharing play an important role
   within this approach. At national level, French players gather within
   the “Club CO[2]” (http://captage-stockage-valorisation-co2.fr/en/home),
   an umbrella organization for information, dialogue and good practices
   on CCS research and technological developments, which contributes to
   the effective management of the national effort.

   France has a strong track record on RD&D in the field of CCS (see
   below). The implementation of a regulatory framework based upon the EU
   directive 2009/31/CE contributed to the developments and paves the way
   for further actions.

France’s RD&D Program in CCS

   The two main sources of public funds to foster RD&D projects on CCS are
   managed by ANR (the French National Research Agency) and ADEME (the
   French Environment and Energy Management Agency).

   Since its creation in 2005, ANR supported:
     * 33 CCS projects funded in the CO[2] Programme (annual calls for
       projects from 2005 to 2008) – ANR funding 27.5 M€ (programme CO[2]
       capture and storage. Among these 33 projects:
          + 13 were dedicated to capture and among these, 8 have
            integrated transport;
          + 17 were dedicated to storage whilst 12 integrated the
            monitoring;
          + 1 was dedicated to transport;
          + 1 was dedicated to risk management and safety criteria; and
          + 1 concerned a socio-economic study and public awareness.
     * 4 CO[2] capture projects funded in the EESI Programme (calls for
       projects in 2009 and 2010) – ANR funding  4.4 M€ (Energy Efficiency
       and CO[2] emissions reduction in Industrial Systems)
     * 4 CCS projects funded in the current SEED programme (2011 call for
       projects) – ANR funding 2.8 M€(Efficient and Decarbonized Energy
       Systems). CCUS, including reuse of CO[2], is one of the three
       sub-programmes. Among the 4 projects selected:
          + 1 is dedicated to capture;
          + 3 are dedicated to storage.

   In addition to the research projects, ANR is also in charge of the
   funding of national excellence research institutes for low-carbon
   energy technologies. In March 2012, the selection of an institute
   working on geological storage of CO[2], geothermal energy and energy
   storage was announced, with a funding of €15.9 million.

   The ADEME supports initiatives CCS and devotes special attention to
   energy efficiency, socioeconomic issues, and environmental impacts.
   Between 2001 and 2009, ADEME invested €3.7 million to support R&D
   projects. Among these 26 projects, 11 are dedicated to capture, one to
   transport, six to storage, six to techno-economic studies and two to
   risk management.

   In addition, ADEME supports the deployment of CCS through the funding
   of demonstration and pilot projects. In 2010, more than €38 million
   were allocated to three projects: post-combustion capture for
   coal-fired power plants (pilot-scale, EDF/ALSTOM), CO[2] storage in
   deep saline aquifers (TOTAL/GDFSuez), CCS for steelmaking (integrated
   industrial-scale project, ARCELOR MITTAL).

   Additional funds have been made available within a national investment
   program. Project proposals are currently being assessed.

   on-200969.html

   EDF/ALSTOM post-combustion capture pilot project – Haute-Normandie,
   France.  The project will test an ALSTOM post-combustion capture
   technology fitted on a coal-fired power plant operated by EDF
   (commissioning is scheduled for T3/T4 2012). Public funding from ADEME
   accounts for one quarter of the total project budget of €22 million.

   ARCELORMITTAL integrated large-scale CCS demonstration project for
   steelmaking – Lorraine, France.  The project will capture CO[2] from a
   blast furnace at industrial scale for further storage in deep saline
   aquifers. The project is currently under progress, it is of particular
   interest for steelmaking and other industrial sectors where only
   limited or no alternative options for massive reduction of CO[2]
   emissions exist today.
