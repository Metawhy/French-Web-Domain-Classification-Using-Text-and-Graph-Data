The Best Red Pepper Bruschetta Recipe

   Major distraction. I have about an hour or so to get work done, before
   I have to go pick Cason up, take a shower, and get ready for a double
   date.

   Having windows open on my browser is always a major distraction. We had
   people over on the 4th of July for a big pool party and my goal was to
   try and have patio furniture by then so people wouldn’t be sitting on
   the floor or the spray deck by the pool. Which may or may not be fine
   but I’d prefer to have my bum sit on a cushion.

   Ya feel me.

   I have spent endless hours searching all over the internet trying to
   find a good deal on patio furniture but also something that I would
   like. Sucking up the time. The problem is … I COULDN’T FIND ANYTHING!

   Any recommendations on places to buy a nice set of cushioned furniture
   that I can put under a covered patio with a cool looking outdoor rug?

   We may not have a place to sit by the pool right now, but at least
   we’ll have good food. And that should count for something right!

   And this Roasted Red Pepper Bruschetta with Burrata will be at the top
   of the list!

   Bruschetta with Burrata - an easy summer appetizer that's light and

   This appetizer screams summer to me! It is light, fresh, grilled and
   meant to be devoured with people!

   The peppers are roasted on the grill right next to the shallots that
   are slightly charred. Instead of using a regular balsamic vinegar I
   used a white balsamic vinegar which is a little lighter for the summer!

   You could even throw the bread on the grill to char it up if you’d
   like. (I just opt for the panini press because it’s so easy!)

   Once everything is ready to go and tossed together then you drizzle it
   on top of creamy burrata! Heck yes!! Ya’ll the burrata combined with
   the bruschetta all on top of crunchy bread. It’s dreamy!

   I hope you guys get a chance to enjoy this Roasted Red Pepper
   Bruschetta this summer, it is absolutely phenomenal!

   Bon Appetit friends and happy weekend!
