   The Evolution Championship Series (Evo for short) represents the
   largest and longest-running fighting game tournaments in the world. Evo
   brings together the best of the best from around the world in a
   dazzling exhibition of skill and fun, as players and fans gather to
   honor the competitive spirit in an open format and determine a
   champion.

   Our tournaments are about more than just winning. Evo is open to
   anyone, feature stations available for relaxed free play, and offer
   unique opportunities to meet people from different countries and
   different walks of life who share your passion. Established champions
   face off against unknown newcomers, and new rivals that might have only
   talked or fought online meet up and become old friends.
