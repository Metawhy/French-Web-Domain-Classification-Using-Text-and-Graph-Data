EHang AAV

   Created by EHANG, Made in China

EHang AAV

   Overview Process Gallery

   Vehicle industrial modeling design is developed by Ehang IDC
   (Industrial Design Center)
   Composite material, from mold opening till manufacturing, is
   independently developed by Ehang composite material center.
   Propeller dynamic testing system and other testing system, are
   developed by EHANG independently.

   Designing EHang AAV requires the vehicle to be safe as well as high
   performance.
   Our structural designer tends to find the answer from
   Aeronautical Material and finally settled with composite material with
   Carbon Fiber and Epoxy, matching aerial Aluminum Alloy.
   The same material is being used for space craft, lightweight and
   strong.

   Safety and Stability is the top priority during our development of the
   product. We have EHang AAV going through strict process of testing.

   Comfortable cabin environment, stable flight experience.
   Excellent dynamic balance and wind resistance assures a smooth and
   steady flight even in windy condition.
