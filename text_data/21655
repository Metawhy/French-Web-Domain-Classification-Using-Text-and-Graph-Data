Welcome to Apache Maven

   Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.
   Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage
   a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of
   information.

   If you think that Maven could help your project, you can find out more
   information in the "About Maven" section of the navigation: this
   includes an in-depth description of what Maven is and a list of some of
   its main features.

   This site is separated into the following sections, depending on how
   you'd like to use Maven:
   Use Download, Install, Run Maven Configure, Use Maven and Maven Plugins
   Information for those needing to build a project that uses Maven
   Information for those wanting to use Maven to build their project,
   including a "10 minute test" that gives a practical overview of Maven's
   main features in just 10 minutes and plugin list for more information
   on each plugin
   Extend Write Maven Plugins Improve the Maven Central Repository
   Information for those who want to provide a Maven plugin for shared
   functionality or to accompany their own product or toolset Information
   for those who may or may not use Maven, but are interested in getting
   project metadata into the central repository
   Contribute Help Maven Develop Maven
   Information if you'd like to get involved: Maven is an open source
   community and welcomes contributions. Information for those who are
   currently developers, or who are interested in contributing to the
   Maven project itself

   Each guide is divided into a number of trails to get you started on a
   particular topic, and includes a reference area and a "cookbook" of
   common examples.

   You can access the guides at any time from the left navigation. If you
   are looking for a quick reference, you can use the documentation index.

How to Get Support

   Support for Maven is available in a variety of different forms.

   To get started, search the documentation, issue management system, the
   wiki or the mailing list archives to see if the problem has been solved
   or reported before.

   If the problem has not been reported before, the recommended way to get
   help is to subscribe to the Maven Users Mailing list. Many other users
   and Maven developers will answer your questions there, and the answer
   will be archived for others in the future.

   You can also reach the Maven developers on IRC.

Apache Software Foundation

   Maven is a part of the Apache Software Foundation. We'd like to thank
   the sponsors that provide financial assistance to the foundation. For
   more information on how you can support the foundation, see the
   sponsorship page.

   Apache Events You can also attend Apache Events: don't hesitate to ask
   on the Maven User mailing list if Maven team members will be there, it
   can be a great opportunity to meet them.
