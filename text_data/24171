Exclusive: Apple planning $4.99/month price for Arcade game subscription

   Last Saturday, 9to5Mac got access to Apple’s early access program for
   Apple Arcade, which was announced back in March when the company held
   its special event dedicated to Services. Apple Arcade will allow iOS,
   Mac, and Apple TV users to pay a flat monthly fee and access a bundle
   of otherwise paid apps through the App Store. Now we’ve discovered that
   Apple Arcade will likely be priced at $4.99 per month.

   The early access program was being offered to Apple employees for the
   symbolic price of 49¢ per month, with a one-month free trial, until the
   end of the early access period, which was said to be when iOS 13 ships
   to customers.

   Today, I was able to get information about the price of an Apple Arcade
   subscription to customers. This information is available in one of the
   APIs used by the App Store app. According to a promotional message
   found in the service, the price for Apple Arcade will be $4.99 / month,
   including a one-month free trial. As Apple previously announced, the
   service will allow access to all members in a Family Sharing account.

   Since the price has not been officially announced yet, it’s possible
   that it will change before the announcement, which is likely going to
   on September 10, when Apple is expected to hold a special event to
   announce new iPhones.

PSA: Many major media players vulnerable to attack via malicious subtitles
files [Video]

   Ben Lovejoy

   - May. 24th 2017 7:11 am PT

   Security researchers have discovered a surprising new way for attackers
   to gain control of a machine: malicious subtitles. The vulnerability is
   device-independent, meaning it could be used to gain control of
   anything from an iPhone to a Mac.

   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]
   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   The vulnerability was discovered by Check Point, which describes it as
   a significant risk.

     Check Point researchers revealed a new attack vector which threatens
     millions of users worldwide – attack by subtitles. By crafting
     malicious subtitle files, which are then downloaded by a victim’s
     media player, attackers can take complete control over any type of
     device via vulnerabilities found in many popular streaming
     platforms, including VLC, Kodi (XBMC), Popcorn-Time and strem.io. We
     estimate there are approximately 200 million video players and
     streamers that currently run the vulnerable software, making this
     one of the most widespread, easily accessed and zero-resistance
     vulnerability reported in recent years.

   There is no evidence that this attack vector is yet in active use, but
   now that the possibility has been disclosed, it’s likely only a matter
   of time before the bad guys figure out the details and start using it.

   Check Point said that the vulnerable code was found in many major media
   players, including VLC, Kodi, Stremio & PopcornTime. There are fixes
   available for all but Kodi, where the source code has been fixed but a
   runtime version is not yet available.
     * PopcornTime– Created a Fixed version, however it is not yet
       available to download in the official website. The fixed version
       can be manually downloaded via the following
       link: https://ci.popcorntime.sh/job/Popcorn-Time-Desktop/249
     * Kodi– Created a fix version, which is currently only available as
       source code release. This version is not yet available to download
       in the official site. Link to the source code fix is available
       here: https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12024
     * VLC– Officially fixed and available to download on their website
       Link: http://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.5.1/win32/vlc-2.2.5.1-win32.e
       xe
     * Stremio– Officially Fixed and avilable to download on their website
       Link: https://www.strem.io/

   The firm has put together a proof of concept based on a Windows
   machine, but stresses that all devices are vulnerable. While malware
   remains a relatively small problem for Apple users, it is not a risk
   which can be completely ignored.

Exclusive: Apple planning $4.99/month price for Arcade game subscription
service after free trial, works with Family Sharing

   Last Saturday, 9to5Mac got access to Apple’s early access program for
   Apple Arcade, which was announced back in March when the company held
   its special event dedicated to Services. Apple Arcade will allow iOS,
   Mac, and Apple TV users to pay a flat monthly fee and access a bundle
   of otherwise paid apps through the App Store. Now we’ve discovered that
   Apple Arcade will likely be priced at $4.99 per month.

   The early access program was being offered to Apple employees for the
   symbolic price of 49¢ per month, with a one-month free trial, until the
   end of the early access period, which was said to be when iOS 13 ships
   to customers.

   Today, I was able to get information about the price of an Apple Arcade
   subscription to customers. This information is available in one of the
   APIs used by the App Store app. According to a promotional message
   found in the service, the price for Apple Arcade will be $4.99 / month,
   including a one-month free trial. As Apple previously announced, the
   service will allow access to all members in a Family Sharing account.

   Since the price has not been officially announced yet, it’s possible
   that it will change before the announcement, which is likely going to
   on September 10, when Apple is expected to hold a special event to
   announce new iPhones.

   Security researchers have discovered a surprising new way for attackers
   to gain control of a machine: malicious subtitles. The vulnerability is
   device-independent, meaning it could be used to gain control of
   anything from an iPhone to a Mac.

   The vulnerability was discovered by Check Point, which describes it as
   a significant risk.

     Check Point researchers revealed a new attack vector which threatens
     millions of users worldwide – attack by subtitles. By crafting
     malicious subtitle files, which are then downloaded by a victim’s
     media player, attackers can take complete control over any type of
     device via vulnerabilities found in many popular streaming
     platforms, including VLC, Kodi (XBMC), Popcorn-Time and strem.io. We
     estimate there are approximately 200 million video players and
     streamers that currently run the vulnerable software, making this
     one of the most widespread, easily accessed and zero-resistance
     vulnerability reported in recent years.

   There is no evidence that this attack vector is yet in active use, but
   now that the possibility has been disclosed, it’s likely only a matter
   of time before the bad guys figure out the details and start using it.

   Check Point said that the vulnerable code was found in many major media
   players, including VLC, Kodi, Stremio & PopcornTime. There are fixes
   available for all but Kodi, where the source code has been fixed but a
   runtime version is not yet available.
     * PopcornTime– Created a Fixed version, however it is not yet
       available to download in the official website. The fixed version
       can be manually downloaded via the following
       link: https://ci.popcorntime.sh/job/Popcorn-Time-Desktop/249
     * Kodi– Created a fix version, which is currently only available as
       source code release. This version is not yet available to download
       in the official site. Link to the source code fix is available
       here: https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12024
     * VLC– Officially fixed and available to download on their website
       Link: http://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.5.1/win32/vlc-2.2.5.1-win32.e
       xe
     * Stremio– Officially Fixed and avilable to download on their website
       Link: https://www.strem.io/

   The firm has put together a proof of concept based on a Windows
   machine, but stresses that all devices are vulnerable. While malware
   remains a relatively small problem for Apple users, it is not a risk
   which can be completely ignored.

Exclusive: Apple planning $4.99/month price for Arcade game subscription service
                  after free trial, works with Family Sharing

   Last Saturday, 9to5Mac got access to Apple’s early access program for
   Apple Arcade, which was announced back in March when the company held
   its special event dedicated to Services. Apple Arcade will allow iOS,
   Mac, and Apple TV users to pay a flat monthly fee and access a bundle
   of otherwise paid apps through the App Store. Now we’ve discovered that
   Apple Arcade will likely be priced at $4.99 per month.

   The early access program was being offered to Apple employees for the
   symbolic price of 49¢ per month, with a one-month free trial, until the
   end of the early access period, which was said to be when iOS 13 ships
   to customers.

   Today, I was able to get information about the price of an Apple Arcade
   subscription to customers. This information is available in one of the
   APIs used by the App Store app. According to a promotional message
   found in the service, the price for Apple Arcade will be $4.99 / month,
   including a one-month free trial. As Apple previously announced, the
   service will allow access to all members in a Family Sharing account.

   Since the price has not been officially announced yet, it’s possible
   that it will change before the announcement, which is likely going to
   on September 10, when Apple is expected to hold a special event to
   announce new iPhones.

Review: A-Audio’s Icon over-ear headphones pack Bluetooth and active noise
cancellation in a premium package

   These days, it seems like there is an endless variety of headphones to
   choose from. With new models popping up on a weekly basis, it’s hard to
   sort through the crowd to find the ones that fit you best. When it
   comes to active noise cancellation this elite selection thins out a
   bit, but there are only a handful that fall into the same category as
   A-Audio’s Icon over-ear headphones.

   From a functionality perspective, these headphones give you everything
   but the kitchen sink. They can be used wirelessly via Bluetooth with
   active noise cancellation, in passive (wired) mode, and even feature
   dual sound profiles. Along with that, they include a wide variety of
   accessories that offer more than enough for any situation…

   Unboxing these headphones was a very pleasant experience. The box opens
   easily and immediately you are presented with a beautiful carrying case
   with a carbon fiber-like design. Within this case, you’ll find
   everything else. First up, you obviously have the headphones, but right
   in the center of the case is a small little bag being secured by Velcro
   that houses the headphone accessories.

   Among the included accessories you’ll find two 4ft audio cables, one of
   which is equipped with an in-line remote/mic combo for controlling
   calls and music playback, a Micro USB cable and wall adapter for
   charging, a warranty card, microfiber cloth, and even an 1,800mAh
   rechargeable battery pack to keep you powered on-the-go. This is the
   first pair of headphones I’ve personally seen that came with its own
   portable battery pack.

   The construction of the Icon headphones is amazing. This particular
   model comes in Phantom Black or Liquid Chrome and features premium
   materials where it matters the most. Each ear cup is attached to a
   steel frame with chrome plating along with leather padding and memory
   foam to keep you comfortable all day long. It’s hard to describe the
   premium design with these headphones in-depth, but you can check out
   our review video for a closer look.

   Watch our A-Audio Icon review video below:

   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   Each ear cup features 40mm drivers which are an absolute joy to listen
   to. Whether you’re utilizing the active noise cancellation or the Bass
   Enhancer mode, the audio is crisp and clear. These two modes case be
   switched between with a double-press of the power button on the
   headphones when in use. As for the passive mode, I didn’t hear a
   noticeable difference in quality between the ANC and passive modes,
   which was surprisingly refreshing compared to other comparable
   headphones.

   Pairing via Bluetooth is very simple. Just hold down the power button
   long enough to kick the headphones into pairing mode and make the
   correct selection in your device’s Bluetooth settings. You’ll have to
   be in Bluetooth mode to take advantage of the active noise cancellation
   or Bass Enhancer mode though. The headphones are also equipped with a
   built-in mic and audio controls for convenience without relying on the
   detachable cable.

   icon-1

   The playback/call controls are actually built into the design of the
   Icon headphones: the right side’s outer plate (where the “A” logo is
   featured) also works as a three button controller. Press on the top end
   for volume up, bottom end for volume down, and in the center a single
   press will play/pause or answer/end calls, double press for skipping
   tracks, and triple press for moving backwards.

   I recently had the chance to test out these headphones on a lengthy
   flight and they delivered the goods. I was able to enjoy my
   music/movies in a peaceful environment without the noise and
   disruptions that come along with travel. The battery life is rated at
   12 hours, which I found to be extremely accurate. If you do happen to
   run out of juice and don’t have the battery pack available, the
   headphones will also work flawlessly in passive mode, minus the sound
   modes.

   controls-icon

   I wish that the active noise cancellation would function when wired,
   just in case I don’t want to mess with Bluetooth at the time, but
   that’s certainly not a deal breaker. The sound quality here is great in
   my opinion—possibly among the best Bluetooth headphones I’ve heard in a
   while though the Bass Enhancer mode was a bit too much for my taste.
   Sound “quality” will always be subjective, but I feel like the Icon
   headphones hit the nail on the head.

   Overall, I don’t have anything to complain about. The Icon headphones
   are well-built, flexible/durable, feature active noise cancellation,
   Bluetooth, great battery life, and all the accessories I could ever
   need. So what’s the catch then? Well, a lot of people will be turned
   off by this next part…

   A-Audio’s Icon headphones retail for $379. I realize that is a pretty
   penny to pay for headphones and the price point will turn many away,
   but they are priced semi-comparably with the market, given their
   feature set. I definitely recommend these headphones, but at this price
   they aren’t for everyone. Check out the above video for a closer look
   at them.

   Apple release iOS 9 and have one of biggest features, real multitasking
   with SplitView. This feature is only available for iPad Pro, iPad Air 2
   and iPad Mini 4. Too, Apple don’t allow to use two Safari pages at same
   time with SplitView, but a Spanish developer has launched new app for
   iPads, called WebPad. WebPad allow to use two Safari webs at same time
   in new iPads with SplitView. But this app have a great feature, with
   WebPad you can use two Safari webs at same time using real multitasking
   in your old iPad that not support SplitView.

   Also, WebPad use the Google Chrome technology because the app have a
   in-app browser that allow users to navigate with the app. The app has 3
   functions: 1.- Use in new iPads to two safari webs in Split View 2.-
   Use in old iPads to have two Safari webs at same time with real
   multitasking 3.- Use as web navigator using Chrome technology to load
   fast the webs.

   The app is develop by Ruben Fernandez, a Spanish developer, but the app
   is translated to English, Spanish and Italian, but very soon, in next
   update the app is localize to German and possible to Chinese.

   Now the app is available in App Store and you can install it in you
   iPad without need Jailbreak (great feature). The app costs $0.99 but
   soon increases the price because now have promotional price for launch.

   You can download it

Pages for iPad has Retina Display icons, but are they for the iPhone?

   We’ve just been tipped that Pages for iPad has Retina display icons.
   We’ve verified the findings, above.  Our first thought was, oh dang,
   the iPad 2 is going to have Retina!  But these icons don’t have iPad
   suffixes.

   Another equally interesting possibility exists.

   Pages, along with the rest of iWork, might be making its way, at long
   last, to the iPhone 4 and iPod touch with Retina.  In either case (or
   if this is just Apple making bigger icons for the sake of being safe),
   we’ve also been hearing to expect updated versions of iWork and
   iWork.com for the iPad 2 launch later this quarter.

PSA: Many major media players vulnerable to attack via malicious subtitles files
                                    [Video]

   Security researchers have discovered a surprising new way for attackers
   to gain control of a machine: malicious subtitles. The vulnerability is
   device-independent, meaning it could be used to gain control of
   anything from an iPhone to a Mac.

   The vulnerability was discovered by Check Point, which describes it as
   a significant risk.

     Check Point researchers revealed a new attack vector which threatens
     millions of users worldwide – attack by subtitles. By crafting
     malicious subtitle files, which are then downloaded by a victim’s
     media player, attackers can take complete control over any type of
     device via vulnerabilities found in many popular streaming
     platforms, including VLC, Kodi (XBMC), Popcorn-Time and strem.io. We
     estimate there are approximately 200 million video players and
     streamers that currently run the vulnerable software, making this
     one of the most widespread, easily accessed and zero-resistance
     vulnerability reported in recent years.

   There is no evidence that this attack vector is yet in active use, but
   now that the possibility has been disclosed, it’s likely only a matter
   of time before the bad guys figure out the details and start using it.

   Check Point said that the vulnerable code was found in many major media
   players, including VLC, Kodi, Stremio & PopcornTime. There are fixes
   available for all but Kodi, where the source code has been fixed but a
   runtime version is not yet available.
     * PopcornTime– Created a Fixed version, however it is not yet
       available to download in the official website. The fixed version
       can be manually downloaded via the following
       link: https://ci.popcorntime.sh/job/Popcorn-Time-Desktop/249
     * Kodi– Created a fix version, which is currently only available as
       source code release. This version is not yet available to download
       in the official site. Link to the source code fix is available
       here: https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12024
     * VLC– Officially fixed and available to download on their website
       Link: http://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.5.1/win32/vlc-2.2.5.1-win32.e
       xe
     * Stremio– Officially Fixed and avilable to download on their website
       Link: https://www.strem.io/

   The firm has put together a proof of concept based on a Windows
   machine, but stresses that all devices are vulnerable. While malware
   remains a relatively small problem for Apple users, it is not a risk
   which can be completely ignored.
