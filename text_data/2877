Welcome to IEEE VIS 2019 in Vancouver!

   VIS 2019 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory,
   methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The
   conference will convene an international community of researchers and
   practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange
   recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools.

   We invite you to share your research, insights, and enthusiasm at IEEE
   Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), IEEE Information
   Visualization (InfoVis), and IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis).
   The 2019 program will also feature a diverse range of symposia and
   co-located events, including Visualization in Practice, Visualization
   in Data Science, the VIS Arts Program, and data analysis Challenge
   competitions, as well as a new Application Spotlights track.

   For 2019, IEEE VIS will take place at the Vancouver Convention Centre
   East, in the heart of one of Canada’s most iconic tech cities. Part of
   the Cascadia Innovation Corridor and home to the Canadian IT
   Supercluster, Vancouver is also renowned for its scenic beauty, outdoor
   activities, and vibrant west-coast culture.

   VIS 2019 General Chairs
   Alex Endert, Georgia Institute of Technology
   Brian Fisher, Simon Fraser University
   Wesley Willett, University of Calgary
