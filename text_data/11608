   About This Product

   Remnant: From the Ashes is a third-person survival shooter that is set
   in a grim post-apocalyptic world where sinister monsters roam. The game
   is developed by Gunfire Games and published by Perfect World
   Entertainment.

   A forgotten evil from another dimension threw the entire world into
   disarray. Chaos descended upon mankind, and now only a few groups of
   humans remain alive. Venture forth into a broken world by yourself or
   with two other survivors and take down the creatures that took over our
   cities, create a foothold, rebuild, and take back what is rightfully
   yours. Hordes of enemies, powerful bosses, and more await, and the
   question is, do you have what it takes to survive and endure?

   Humanity may be on the brink of extinction, but it has access to
   technology that lets them open portals to other realms and even
   alternate realities. In order to locate the evil that started all of
   this, players need to use these portals, scavenge for resources, and
   take down any opposition that stands in their path. Remnant: From the
   Ashes features dynamically-generated worlds, different each time you
   visit them. New maps, new enemy encounter,s new quest opportunities,
   and new in-world events will make sure that you always have something
   to do.

   Four unique worlds are present in-game, each with its own monsters and
   environments. Slay these beasts in combat, acquire potent loot and
   upgrade materials, and build an arsenal of devastating weapons, strong
   armor, and advanced modifications. Take on the danger with two others
   if you wish to conquer the toughest of challenges that are available.

   This game is pretty nice in all ways, huge locations, lots of different
   enemies and bosses, skills, weapons etc... + you have a coop with is
   better. Playing this game alone i think from my way it's little bit
   hard at the start when you fight with bosses but in coop it's fun. To
   explore huge locations, finding secrets, killing bosses, crafting new
   weapons etc... with friends I recommend this game if you have friends
   who can play together with you. This game needs a better optimization
   and fixing bugs etc.... If Developers planing some DLC it's can be a
   very good Dark Souls copy only with gun's and some added stuffs.

   About This Product

   Control is a supernatural action-adventure game in which players take
   on the role of a new Director that is facing an otherworldly threat.
   The game is developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by 505
   Games.

   This secret agency that is located in New York is being threatened by a
   strange enemy, not from this world. Can you regain Control, or will
   your foe prove to be too much for you to handle? Use powerful
   supernatural abilities and combine them with loadouts that you can
   customize to suit your playstyle as you explore various reactive
   environments and fight unknown threats. The world you know is much
   deeper and unpredictable than you imagined, so prepare for the
   unexpected.

   Control shows us the story of Jesse Fadens as she desperately tries to
   find answers to an insane situation while also trying to understand her
   new position of Director. Experience a terrific and complex story as
   you witness this mysterious world and the many allies that you're going
   to meet along the way. Many sidequests and secrets are located all over
   the place, and you and your Bureau agents need to decode them and find
   out the sinister truth about the Bureau experiments.

   Control features a unique and sprawling world filled with special
   environments and an architecture that is always changing. Decide what
   your playstyle is going to be by picking your supernatural abilities,
   upgrades, and modifiable loadouts. Thanks to dynamic environmental
   destruction the combat in this game is exhilarating, brutal, and
   violent, a perfect match for the grim story that takes place in this
   unforgiving world.

   About This Product

   Minecraft Windows 10 Edition gives you the option of going on many
   adventures, exploring infinite worlds, and building all manner of
   things, including houses, castles, and more.

   The game offers two modes, Creative Mode and Survival Mode. Creative
   Mode is the mode where you get unlimited resources and you can do
   whatever you want to, and this is the mode designed for those of you
   that just want to build things. On the other hand, Survival Mode, as
   you can tell from its name, throws you into a harsh world that you have
   to survive in, create weapons and armor, build a shelter, and more.
   Minecraft Windows 10 Edition also runs on Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed
   Reality devices, and it supports all of the features of Minecraft that
   we enjoy.

   Expand your game with various community creations from the marketplace.
   Get special skins, maps, and even texture packs from all kinds of
   creators. You can enjoy the game with 10 friends cross-platform on your
   own Realms, which are private servers that are hosted just for you.
   There are also all kinds of massive multiplayer servers in the game
   where you can join huge communities and play together, build together,
   and most importantly, have fun together.

   About This Product

   Minecraft is a game where you can totally give free rein to your
   imagination: you can create a world and share it over internet.

   This is a "sandbox" game, coded in Java with its 8-bit graphics style,
   rather ugly but that doesn't matter as it's still extremely fun.
   Several modes are available like the Classic Mode or Survival Mode
   where you must survive in a randomly generated world.

   The map is simply enormous and can represent up to 10 times the surface
   of the earth ! Everything is possible in Minecraft: trees, forests,
   rivers, volcanoes, deserts, animals, monsters ...

   If everything goes well during the day, at nightfall, the monsters will
   emerge from everywhere and you should be very careful ... This is where
   your building skills with traps and all other shelters will be of use.
   To build your stuff you will obviously need the resources collected in
   the trees or rocks found in the world or in hidden chests everywhere.

To activate the key go to https://minecraft.net/user/redeem and click
"register for a Mojang account" or log in if you already have an account.
Choose "redeem gift code or prepaid card" option and type in your code.
Please remember to type the key without spaces nor pauses.
