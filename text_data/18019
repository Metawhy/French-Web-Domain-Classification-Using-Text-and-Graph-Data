École des Ponts Paris Tech

   École des Ponts ParisTech - created in 1747 under the name École Royale
   des Ponts et Chaussées -is one of the most prestigious engineering
   institutions in Europe. The establishment trains engineers to a high
   level of scientific, technical and general competency with a persistent
   and strong desire to innovate in the future of building and design.

Research labs

   The Navier Laboratory is a mixed research unit of École des Ponts
   ParisTech, IFSTTAR and the CNRS who brings together more than 170
   people. Within the lab, the team “Architectured Materials and
   Structures” tackles research in structural engineering and materials
   mechanics with a special focus on lightweight structures and complex
   geometries and it strongly supports the Design by Data program.

Fablabs, coworking and maker-spaces

   The school partnered up with some of the most active and vibrant
   coworking spaces and fablabs in Paris to offer students the best
   collaborative learning experience. The program offers acces to

   Is our world being shaped by algorithms or by us?

   For architects design and architecture are tools to shape the world and
   make of it a more beautiful and more comfortable place to live in, so
   we think it is very important to ask ourselves : Is our world being
   shaped by algorithms or by us? This question arose a few days ago
   during an exchange between me … Read More
