   loved it just as much as every other time before! Here are a few photos

                  Kwik Sew Pinafore for Sewing World Magazine!

   Posted on September 1, 2017 by Louise

   Kwik Sew 4138 Pinafore

   Pinafore dresses are the talk of the sewing town at the moment. Nearly
   every blogger I know has made the Tilly and the Buttons Cleo dress
   (which has reached an almost cult status!), but I wanted to see if the
   same look could be achieved using a different pattern to go against the
   grain a little. It turns out there really aren‚Äôt many other pinafore
   patterns out there to choose from, but I settled on Kwik Sew 4138 which
   I think is a lovely alternative to the Cleo.

   If you‚Äôd like to read more about my pinafore, then take a look at the
   October 2017 issue of Sewing World Magazine (available mid-September)!
   I made this project on behalf of Minerva Crafts especially for the
   magazine, using some fabulous 4oz denim cotton, and I think it was a
   success! It was a fun project to sew and would be a great layering
   piece for autumn/winter. Hope you like it!

                           DIY Patchwork Baby Blanket

   Posted on August 6, 2017 by Louise

   4

   As soon as I found out my sister-in-law was expecting, I knew I wanted
   to make her a blanket. Baby blankets are useful in all situations,
   whether it‚Äôs as a comforter in the cot, for warmth in a pram, or simply
   as a comfy floor covering whilst baby lounges around. So that‚Äôs what
   I‚Äôve got to share with you today ‚Äì a patchwork baby blanket!

   elephant patchwork baby blanket

   Now, I‚Äôd like you all to know that I made this blanket before I knew
   the baby would be a boy. I also made it before I learnt that my
   sister-in-law was going with a grey and white colour scheme. But when
   can you make a brightly coloured quilt if not for a little one?!

   The fabric I used for my patchwork blanket is from the Remnant House in
   Harrogate. I bought fat quarters of yellow polka dot cotton,  elephant
   print cotton, and about 2 metres of green gingham cotton to use for
   both the patchwork squares and the backing.

   patchwork baby blanket

   Now it‚Äôs time for the maths (thanks to my cat, Barnaby, for helping me
   measure)! I didn‚Äôt follow a pattern to make this blanket ‚Äì it‚Äôs all DIY
   and common sense. Based on the number of fat quarters I had, I worked
   out I could make the blanket 8 by 9 squares, 72 in total ‚Äì 18 yellow,
   18 green and 36 elephant. I stitched the squares into rows with a 1cm
   seam allowance, and then stitched the rows together one by one to form
   the front of the blanket. Easy!

   Next, I attached the patchwork front to a thin layer of 2oz wadding by
   quilting down the vertical seam lines. Go slowly when you attach the
   wadding so that it doesn‚Äôt get caught in your sewing machine!

   baby blanket backing

   The back of the blanket is simply a big square of green gingham with a
   strip of elephant print cotton along the top and bottom edges. To
   assemble the blanket, I then put the patchwork and backing pieces right
   sides together and stitched 1cm from the edge all the way round 3
   sides. I then turned the blanket the right way out (so the wadding is
   now in the middle), pressed under the seam allowance on the open edge,
   and stitched a 1cm border all around the blanket. Oh and I added a
   little ‚Äòhandmade‚Äô tag for good measure.

   So do you love it? Do you think it‚Äôs suitable for a new baby boy? I
   hope he loves it too!

                          Knitted MillaMia Elk Cushion

   Posted on May 27, 2017 by Louise

   2

   MillaMia Elk Cushion I‚Äôve had this knitting project on the back burner
   for absolutely ages. It‚Äôs one of those projects that you pick up and do
   a few rows of, but then you get tired and have to put it back down
   again, so it‚Äôs been a long time coming! I‚Äôm so glad I persisted with it
   though ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt the finished cushion look great?

   For this knitting project, I used the MillaMia Elk Cushion pattern that
   I bought at the Knitting and Stitching Show in Harrogate a couple of
   years ago (I actually bought the Elk Cushion Kit, which contains the
   pattern and required amount of 4-ply yarn). I was drawn in by the
   adorable Nordic design on the front of the cushion, which is described
   as an ‚Äòelegant design of hearts, chain people and elks (or are they
   reindeer‚Ä¶?)‚Äô

   millamia elk cushion kit

   The cushion uses 100% merino wool, so it‚Äôs very soft to the touch. I
   used 2 balls of Claret (104) and 2 balls of Snow (124), as well as a
   pair of 3.25mm needles and a 30cm(ish) cushion pad.

   I think I started knitting the cushion around a year ago and finished
   sewing it up this past week. The eagle-eyed among you may notice that I
   knitted the design upside down, with the elks at the bottom rather than
   the top. Oops. I think it looks fab on my Scandi M&S chair though,
   don‚Äôt you?

                           Sew Over It Silk Cami Top

   Posted on May 14, 2017 by Louise

   Sew Over It Cami Top Hey guys! It appears as if this is my first sewing
   project since the start of April, so welcome back! I put the radio
   silence down to a couple of things: a lot of busy weekends and the fact
   I‚Äôve been working on a secret sewing project for a magazine feature.
   I‚Äôm keeping that project under wraps for now but it‚Äôs taken up all my
   sewing time recently! Anyhow, I‚Äôm back today with a quick project that
   I whipped up this weekend: a silk camisole top.

   I received the Sew Over It silk cami top kit as a birthday present last
   year and it‚Äôs been on my ‚Äòto make‚Äô list since January. Now that the
   weather‚Äôs beginning to warm up, I‚Äôve been inspired to get it started!

   The kit contained the sewing pattern, instructions and a length of
   silky viscose fabric in this very cute bow print (which actually looks
   a bit like bones from a distance!). Unfortunately, the cami kit is
   discontinued now, but some sewing shops still have a few hanging around
   if you keep your eyes peeled! The PDF pattern for the top is also still
   available from the Sew Over It website. As for the fabric, any type of
   viscose would sew up lovely ‚Äì Minerva Crafts has a great range of
   affordable ones that I‚Äôm tempted by!

   Sew Over It Silk Cami

   There are only four pattern pieces needed to make this camisole so it‚Äôs
   the perfect project for an afternoon. I think it took me about two
   hours to finish! There are the front and back pieces, plus two for the
   neck/armhole facings. I read a few other blogs about the Sew Over It
   cami pattern and some people got a bit confused with the method for
   sewing on the facing, but I managed it fine and with only one minor
   unpicking incident required.

   Sew Over It Silk Cami Kit Top

   Overall I really like this pattern. I thought the neckline might be too
   low for me but it actually sits about right without making any
   adjustments! The length is also nice on me ‚Äì it‚Äôs just long enough to
   cover my bum or to tuck into a skirt. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3 though so I imagine
   this is normal waist length for most people! What do you think? Have
   you made the Sew Over It cami before?

   PS ‚Äì I‚Äôd just like to say a massive THANK YOU to everyone who‚Äôs
   following my blog and reading my posts. After publishing this project I
   noticed that I‚Äôve achieved over 2,000 followers which is incredible, so
   thank you! üôÇ

          Blogger Network #32 ‚Äì Chambray Shirt Dress, New Look 6449

   New Look 6449 Shirt Dress

   Hello April! I don‚Äôt know where the time is going these days, but it
   seems as if I haven‚Äôt shared a project with you for a whole month and
   it‚Äôs time for another Minerva Blogger Network post already! In my
   defense, this month I‚Äôve made a lovely chambray shirt dress (New Look
   6449) to share with you, and we all know that shirt dresses don‚Äôt just
   sew themselves together overnight‚Ä¶ (can you imagine?!). I used this
   charcoal grey chambray to make my dress, then finished it off with 12
   of these silver shell-effect buttons and an Eiffel Tower motif. What do
   you think?

   Click here to head to the Minerva Crafts website and read/see more of
   my shirt dress!
