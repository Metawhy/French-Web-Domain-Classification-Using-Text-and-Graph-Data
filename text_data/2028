NHS 111 service told it must improve

   Published:
          16 June 2016

   Provider:
          South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust

   Categories:

          + Public

   We have told South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust that
   it must make significant improvements to protect the safety of people
   using its NHS 111 services.

   The service, which covers Devon, Dorset, Cornwall and the Isles of
   Scilly, has been rated overall as Inadequate.

   We found that there were often not enough staff to take calls, or to
   give clinical advice. Staff reported working long hours, and there was
   high staff turnover and sickness rates.

   Too many calls were abandoned, and patients were waiting too long for
   their calls to be answered and to be assessed, or to receive a callback
   with appropriate advice. There was a risk that patients needing urgent
   attention were not given priority.

   Following an inspection we issued a Warning Notice requiring the trust
   to ensure that calls are responded to in a timely and effective manner,
   with enough suitably qualified staff on duty who are supported to deal
   with the volume of calls.

     NHS 111 services are an important part of the urgent care system,
     ensuring people have quick and easy access to healthcare advice and
     information - and urgent attention when that's appropriate.
