Abstract

   We develop a statistical framework to use satellite data on night
   lights to augment official income growth measures. For countries with
   poor national income accounts, the optimal estimate of growth is a
   composite with roughly equal weights on conventionally measured growth
   and growth predicted from lights. Our estimates differ from official
   data by up to three percentage points annually. Using lights, empirical
   analyses of growth need no longer use countries as the unit of
   analysis; we can measure growth for sub- and supranational regions. We
   show, for example, that coastal areas in sub-Saharan Africa are growing
   slower than the hinterland. (JEL E01, E23, O11, 047, 057)
