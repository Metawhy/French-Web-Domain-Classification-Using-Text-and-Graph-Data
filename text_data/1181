   Visit France – The Land Of The Past, The Present and The Future

   If you plan on vacationing around Europe, you should take a really
   close look at France. France is such a diversified country and almost
   impossible to cover with many visits. If Brittany is on your schedule,
   you should stop by Carnac to view one of the oldest and largest
   collection of prehistoric standing stones in the entire world; known as
   the Carnac Stones. Visit Nantes to behold the massive and amazingly
   exquisite château des ducs de Bretagne, the permanent residence of the
   last dukes.

   France has magnetized people from all over the world due to it’s
   endless opportunities for visitors of all tastes and lifestyles. Very
   few cities have ever reached the apex of Paris – The City of Lights.
   Her countryside will gently guide you back in time as you visit
   buildings older than some entire countries.

   For historians, there are vast areas that cover everything from the
   invasion of the Romans to World War II military sites. Artists will
   reel over the number of legendary artists that created their
   immortality in Paris, including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec who captured
   the theatrical life of Paris in the 19th century. Other
   Post-Impressionists in Paris included Cézanne, Van Gogh and Gauguin.
   Food enthusiasts, what can you say? The France are renown for their
   food and wine!

   From the canyons of the Pyrenees, half-moon bays of Corsica or the
   limestone hills of Provence, France is vast in places to visit and
   steeped in amazing history. With so many regions, it’s incredible to
   realize each region is completely different from the others. The lush
   valleys of Dordogne, the gentle meadows of Loire valley to the glacial
   peaks of the Alps. The French people, throughout the country refer to
   their regions as “mon pays” or “my country”. This thought has lasted
   throughout the centuries from Louis XIV to Charles de Gaulle.

   While traveling around France, you will discover how vast and spacious
   the countryside really is. There are areas of woodland and undeveloped
   areas where you will not see so much as one house. This is probably the
   biggest reason why industrialization came to France much later than
   other European countries. The French hold firmly to the importance of
   the land which is a large part of their culture, regional pride in
   local cuisine and defender of their agricultural appropriations. There
   are literally hundreds of villages and towns that have barely changed
   from centuries past. Their homes, streets are as much a part of their
   lives as their hills, rivers and fields.

History

   For well over a thousand years, France has been the leader of European
   development, accumulated wealth and elder experience. With such a rich
   history, as you travel from county to county, you will sense the power
   of France’s past. From Dordogne’s prehistoric cave paintings to Roman
   monuments in the south. Visit Gothic cathedrals to the north and
   châteaux of the Loire with it’s grandeur.

More On The Carnac Stones

   Most of the stones are within the Breton village of Carnac, but some to
   the east are within La Trinité-sur-Mer. The stones were erected at some
   stage during the Neolithic period, probably around 3300 BC, but some
   may date to as old as 4500 BC. – Wikipedia

Traveling Around France

   There are so many things to do in this country that it’s almost
   impossible to name everything. Whether you are more of a city person
   tripping the nightlife of Paris or taking in mountain ranges,
   cathedrals or living for their world famous cuisine. There is something
   for everyone. There are endless outdoor activities from canoeing,
   cycling, skiing, sailing or hiking. For that city enthusiast – night
   clubs, fashion shows, movies, shops, music or a sidewalk cafe!

   Traditions, famous throughout the world, include their food, their
   pottery and haute couture. Their strong support for the arts within the
   film industry as well as their innovative museums and galleries. They
   are also leaders in aeroplane design, colonial history and even fishing
   techniques. The list can go on and on, but without doubt their most
   famous and outstanding tradition is within the fine arts in Paris.
   Paris has nurtured and embraced the most famous of creative artists
   over the past 2 centuries. The French artists: Monet & Matisse and
   Foreign artists such as Picasso and Van Gogh. These artists spent many
   years residing among the Parisian people and perfecting their own
   styles.

Symbols Of France

   I think most people equate France with the Eiffel Tower, great foods,
   wines and cheeses. France is a beautiful and amazing country that will
   always offer another surprise each time to visit. Their food is
   excellent, their history is breathtaking and the overall atmosphere is
   carefree. Have a countryside picnic or along the Seine. Take in its
   extraordinary ruins, castles, architecture that leaves her landscape
   mind-boggling. Where ever you roam throughout this wonderful country,
   you will find something exceptional. If you want to walk back in time,
   it’s here. If you want to dance the night away, it’s here. If you want
   to visit gardens painted by Monet, it’s here.

Expenses

   France is a very expensive venture only exceeded by Italy.Check
   this http://installment lenders: all credit types welcome, if  you are
   on a tight budget it can be a little difficult but not impossible. Shop
   around for affordable accommodations and bring a few extra Euros to
   take in the food, the beauty and the wine. Bordeaux in the south West
   of the country as well as the cote d’azur located south East are also
   two pricey destinations. Let’s look at some cost cutters that might
   just work well for you:

Accommodations

   There are Dorm Rooms that range from 15 to 40 EUR per night. This
   depends on where you are staying within the country, Paris, the French
   Riviera and Bordeaux being the most expensive.

   Private Rooms in Hostels will run you approximately 75 EUR +. There are
   budget hotels that start off at 60 EUR per night. The good news is, as
   you move further out from Paris, the French Riviera and Bordeaux,
   accommodations will be less expensive.

   Another alternative is looking for rooms to rent or an apartment. This
   choice will serve you best in a city like Paris.

Food

   Food, undoubtedly, is an experience in France. If you buy your own food
   you can save a great deal of money and is rather cheap. There are many
   cheese, bread and meat shops everywhere so take advantage of them. Stop
   by these shops, gather some favorites and go on a picnic! You can
   easily put together your own lunch for approximately 10 EUR for two
   people and that includes wine! You may also pickup pre-made sandwiches
   at local shops for approximately 4 to 7 EUR. Eating out at a restaurant
   will cost you between 20 to 35 EUR for one meal and a glass of wine. If
   you can afford it, opt to pick one night for a restaurant treat, you
   won’t regret it. The upside is, shopping for all your food will only
   cost you about 45 to 65 EUR for an entire week.

Transportation

   OK, you’ve got to be able to get around the countryside as well as
   within cities. The best way is via train service. Overnight trains are
   less expensive vs the faster high-speed TGV train lines. The TGV lines
   will run you around 90 EUR, while local train systems are around 1 to 3
   EUR, per trip, and are very reliable. Transportation from airports into
   cities are pretty affordable and very user friendly. To go from Charles
   de Gaulle airport to Paris is around 12 EUR. Taxi travel is pretty
   expensive on a budget, so stay away from them if you possibly can.

Fun Things To Do

   Wine tours are very popular but are also the most expensive activity,
   ringing in at 90 EUR per day! Other attractions such as museums with
   entrance fees between 9 to 20 EUR. There are parks and other sites that
   will cost little to nothing, so do your homework before deciding where
   you’d like to hang out in France.

Other Things To Do And See In France

   If you plan to stay in Paris, this city offers absolutely everything!
   Museums, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, parks, clubs, the Seine, other
   culture sites and again – great food!

   Paris is the perfect place for those who love art and food, this is
   Paris’ history. It’s considered one of the most magical places on
   earth, though it will take your entire lifetime to cover everything!
   Stay for about 4 to 5 days to get a good idea how much there really is
   within The City of Lights! Paris is considered one of the most favorite
   cities in the entire world among tourists. You will find something new
   every time you visit. Don’t try to take in too much, take your time,
   enjoy each day, drink some wine and just soak in Paris.

Normandy

   The beaches of D-Day, WWII Allied forces landed along the beach of
   northern France. There are many memorials and museums that cover the
   history of the historical event. It’s a place definitely worth
   visiting. If you are a history buff, you should visit Normandy!

Versailles

   Located very near Paris, the Palace of Versailles was the home of
   French kings and built by Luis XIV. It was constructed at the height of
   France’s power and wealth. It’s is as spectacular today as it was back
   then. Occupation by French Kings came crashing down during the French
   Revolution in 1789.

Loire Valley

   This is the loveliest and most picturesque areas in all of France. The
   vineyards and chateaus are absolutely breathtaking. You will discover
   some the finest wines in the world, perfect small town ambiance and the
   best of foods. Loire Valley should not go by without a visit.

Bordeaux

   Some of the very best wine in the entire world is made here in
   Bordeaux. That said, it’s rather expensive and really not for those on
   a tight budget, for more options you can check https://gadcapital.com/
   they offer unsecured holiday loans. That said, it is an absolutely
   beautiful area of France. If you love seafood, this is the place to be
   with its seaside access and wine! Next to Paris, this is one of the
   most popular destinations.

Nice (pronounced Neece)

   Nice Is Nice! The only way you will find out how “nice” Nice is going
   there! Nice is a seaside town in the southern region of France and is a
   very popular destination among those on a budget. It’s a great place to
   soak up the sun when places like Cannes or Monaco are non-affordable.
   It’s central location makes it an ideal place to explore the coastal
   areas and there’s plenty to explore.

Lyon

   Visit amazing castles and small villages that step back in time. If you
   are into exploring the countryside, Lyon is the perfect destination.
   This is medieval France and is a UNESCO World Heritage place. You will
   definitely feel like you have taken a time machine back in time!

Monaco

   This famous tiny kingdom offers tiny streets, exquisite buildings and
   some of the world’s most famous casinos and million dollar yachts. Rub
   shoulders with the elite who come to visit Cote D’Azur during the
   summer.

St. Tropez

   Catch a boat to St. Tropez, relax around beautiful hillside towns, swim
   in the most beautiful, azure blue waters while rubbing shoulders with
   the rich and famous.

Alsace

   A northeast region of France is a wonderful place to spend some
   vacation time. Comar is quite old and the main attraction. Some the
   buildings here date back to 1300!

Parc de la Villette

   There is a large collection of architectural follies, theme gardens and
   plenty of open space to explore. It is host to a science museum and
   some strange attractions. It’s great for both adults and children alike
   and is a great place to stop off. Your kids will have a lot of fun
   here.

France – World War I

   During World War I, France was ground zero! There are so many areas
   that still show the damage caused over those years around the country.
   There were 2 very significant battles at Vimy Ridge and Verdun. Both of
   these sites have excellent tourist centers and facilities. This is
   another must for historians.

Roman Ruins

   Explore some of the oldest ruins outside of Italy. Nimes, Arles and
   Orange offers some of the most beautiful Roman theatres. Nimes has a
   well preserved temple as well. These place are a very worthwhile place
   to visit while walking back in time!

Carcassonne

   This medieval town is a walled city (which still remains walled) in the
   south of France. The story goes that a towns woman fed remaining food
   to a pig. Once fattened up, they tossed it over the wall so that it
   seemed they were so well fed, they were actually wasteful and
   gluttonous. The attacking soldiers simply gave up and went home. This
   town still retains its medieval atmosphere and has many great shops to
   explore. This town is older than some countries!

The French Alps

   Some of the very best slopes in all of Europe. If you are in France
   during the winter months and love to ski, form a group, rent a chalet
   or stay at one of the slope side hotels and enjoy a long day on the
   slopes. The French Alps has been drawing seasoned skiers for many, many
   years and is never a disappointment.

Culinary Delights

   Culinary delights are to die for! Breakfast with warm croissants from
   the boulangerie, visit Parisian bistros, shop at the local markets that
   are second nature to the French. There is no place that offers a larger
   variety of magnificent foods to enjoy each and every day. Crepes in
   Brittany, Champagne flutes in ancient Reims and the list is endless!
   Visit the world famous Champagne region located near Reims for an
   amazing wine tasting experience!

Art de Vivre

   The rhythm of life is dictated by the seasons. Rural France exudes
   intimacy that is irresistible. Live the French lifestyle, embrace her
   luxuries and simple ways of life. French coffee, croissants in a cafe
   or strolling through the lily gardens that Monet painted. Walk along a
   beach in Brittany while soaking in cultural styles and languages, music
   and mythology from 5th century Celtics.

Montmartre

   Montmartre is a section of Paris and houses the famous dance hall the
   Moulin Rouge that first opened in 1889 and was made famous by the
   Post-Impressionist Toulouse-Lautrec. His famous work included the
   cancan dancers and other actors and performers, making this hall
   world-famous.

Conclusion

   For your next holiday or vacation, come to the magical land of France.
   Discover their history in theatre and art. Visit the beautiful vineyard
   regions while enjoying a wine tasting. Visit the Moulin Rouge, made
   famous by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s beautiful impressionist paintings
   of cancan dancers. View the lights of Paris from the Eiffel Tower. Stay
   a week, stay a month, stay a year – you will never get to see
   everything!

   France has such an amazing place to visit, magnifying existence and
   being legendary for everything from fine arts, food, wine and
   surrealistic landscape. It is a perfect country, offering an amazing
   history, culture and totally impossible to cover everything within your
   lifetime. While relaxing at a sidewalk cafe – bon appétit!
