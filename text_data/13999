Getting to know America Hill Ruins

   March 30, 2015
   tags: America Hill, caribbean, Cinnamon Bay Trail, hiking, St John,
   USVI, VI National Park, VINP

   photo 1 There’s certainly no shortage of ruins on St John, and looking
   back through the archives of this blog, you’ll see that most of our
   favorite hikes include a ruin or two. One that I don’t seem to get to
   as often is America Hill, but the America Hill House ruins are some of
   my favorites – I’m sure you’ll see why when you see the pictures! Not
   only are the ruins attractive, the views of the north shore of St John
   are stunning.

     In its hey day, the boarding house was rumored to have been used by
     rum runners, which totally makes sense when you see the nearly
     300-degree view it commanded of the north side of the island.

   photo 1 (1) The hike up is steep at first, and fairly exposed, but as
   you cross the gut it levels out a bit and becomes shadier & cooler.
   Once you reach the America Hill Spur, which is not very far up Cinnamon
   Bay Trail, it’s only about five more minutes to the ruins. The walls of
   the house are mostly intact, and you can see where the remains of the
   front steps were. This wasn’t a “Great House” like the ruins at Windy
   Point on Johnny Horn Trail, but rather a smaller Estate House which was
   eventually used as a guesthouse in the early 1900’s. One of the last
   guests was said to be Trujillo, former dictator of the Dominican
   Republic, just adding to the site’s illustrious history.

   For more information on America Hill Estate House & the Cinnamon Bay
   Trail, I recommend visiting SeeStJohn.com’s page on the hike – they
   also have some more impressive pictures!

   There really isn’t a bad hike on St John, every trail in the VI
   National Park has something to offer, but the views and ruins on this
   particular trail are spectacular.

Upcoming Blog Post: Cinnamon Bay Trail & America Hill Ruins

   March 27, 2015

   It’s mid-season here in St John and that means lots of business! The
   only downside of that is less time to get out and enjoy our fair
   island, but this weekend we’ve got a new hike on the agenda! The
   Cinnamon Bay Trail is one we haven’t featured before, and the ruins at
   America Hill are some of our favorites, so stay tuned for pictures and
   a little bit of the history of the area, coming Monday morning!

Hiking: Fish Bay Gut

   August 4, 2014

   “Guts” on St John are a feature of our mountainous terrain.  During
   rainstorms, water runs off down the mountainsides and into the valleys
   between them, making its way toward the sea.  Heavy rains wash soil and
   sediment downstream, leaving piles of boulders and bare rock.  The gut
   environments are usually lush and jungle-like, due to the profusion of
   water in the area.

   Pool and Running Water - Fish Bay Gut Fish Bay Gut is one of the most
   popular among hikers.  It is one of the only south shore guts with
   permanent water, along with Battery Gut (also in Fish Bay), Living Gut
   (Reef Bay), and Guinea Gut (Great Cruz Bay).  This hike is very
   challenging, as it involves periods of intense climbing and rock
   scrambling.  The gut environment is dynamic and obstacles can vary
   depending on the amount of rainfall and the time of year.  Rocks are
   frequently slippery and passage in and out is slow and remote for
   rescue crews.  This hike is recommended only for those in good physical
   condition – DO NOT attempt this hike alone, and always exercise
   caution.

   Fish Bay Gut is accessed from either side of the bridge in Fish Bay.
   Be prepared to get wet on this hike, as vegetation can be damp in the
   mornings, and some portions of the Gut are passable only through the
   pools and running water.  The freshwater pools of Fish Bay Gut are home
   to freshwater crabs and small crayfish, as well as fish whose eggs can
   lie dormant for years until there is sufficient rainfall to support
   life in the pool.  After about a quarter mile, you will reach the
   intersection with Battery Gut – the left fork – which continues up
   through Gifft Hill Valley.  A further 0.1 mile past this intersection,
   up Battery Gut, you’ll come to the 70 foot waterfall.  There are fresh
   water pools at the top and bottom of the falls, but the climb is only
   recommended for experienced rock climbers.  Most of the waterfalls
   along Fish Bay Gut are more gradual than this one, and more accessible,
   but climbing them is tricky, and slippery – use caution.

   For more information about Fish Bay and Battery Guts,
   visit SeeStJohn.com

   Our hike, the day after Tropical Storm Bertha passed by, was blessed
   with nearly perfect conditions.  The sun was shining, it was fairly
   cool, and while there wasn’t quite as much water as we’d hoped, there
   was enough, and plenty of dry rock and ground to climb on.  We
   benefitted from a group of four hikers visiting from St Thomas – their
   hiking and climbing abilities far surpassed ours, and we thank them for
   blazing a trail for us to follow (albeit much more slowly!).  Check out
   the gallery to see some more pictures from our hike!

Our Caribbean Inspired “Must Read” List

   July 31, 2014

   One thing that is true of life on an island is that there’s always time
   to read.  On the beach, on a boat, on the couch by candlelight when the
   power goes out (inevitably around here, thanks to WAPA)… tons of
   opportunities to pick up a whole new world in a book and disappear for
   a while.

   We’re lucky to be here pretty much all the time, but we know y’all miss
   the Caribbean when you’re not around, so here are a few of our favorite
   Caribbean beach reads.

   Islands In The Stream, Ernest Hemingway

   20140731-130211-46931010.jpg

   in 1970, 9 years after his death, this final novel follows the
   adventures (and misadventures) of Thomas Hudson, a painter living on
   the island of Bimini.  In Hemingway’s trademark terse prose, we follow
   Hudson from fishing trips in the Gulf Stream to anti-submarine missions
   off the Cuban coast.  For a full description, see here.


   The Rum Diary, Hunter S Thompson

   20140731-130211-46931050.jpg

   You just can’t talk about Iconic Literature Set In The Caribbean
   without mentioning this book.  Lifestyle guide to some, cautionary tale
   to others, memorable to everyone… begun by a then-22-year-old Hunter S
   Thompson, the novel takes you through the chaos that was life in 1950’s
   San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Includes a cameo of St Thomas Carnival as well
   as a nearly untouched Vieques.  Read the description and reviews here.


   Archipelago, Monique Roffrey

   20140731-130211-46931081.jpg

   Set further down island than our first two recommendations, Archipelago
   follows the sailing adventure of Gavin and his young daughter.  When
   tragedy drives them from their home in Trinidad, the pair set out on a
   journey to the Galapagos Islands via the Panama Canal.  A striking
   novel of loss and the growth that comes from grief, the novel also
   benefits from its lush settings along the southern Caribbean.  More
   description and reviews are found here.


   Don’t Stop The Carnival, Herman Wouk

   20140731-130211-46931107.jpg

   This book.  It’s basically a timeless user’s guide to life in the
   islands as a stateside transplant.  I own two copies.  One friend of
   mine keeps copies in her room, her living room, and her guest room,
   just in case everyone in the house wants to read it at once.  New York
   City press agent Norman Paperman moves to a Caribbean island and buys a
   hotel (mid-life crisis, anyone?)… the kind of ridiculousness that only
   happens down here ensues.  Just do yourself a favor and read it.
   Description and reviews here.


   Go forth and read!  Think I missed a crucial book?  Please share your
   thoughts and recommendations on Facebook or on Twitter (@Just_BEach)!

Sunscreen: Your Skin’s BFF

   Sunscreen: Your Skin’s BFF

   As the season changes here in the islands from winter to summer (yes,
   we think we have seasons), we’d like to take this opportunity once
   again to remind everyone: WEAR SUNSCREEN!!

   Seriously people, we’re seeing some wicked burns come through the shop.
    This article by the ACS (link in the title of this post) provides
   great tips, please read it.  Most importantly:

   #1 – wear sunscreen, obvi.  Preferably SPF 15 or higher, although
   anything over SPF 30 shows negligible increase in protection.

   #2 – reapply said sunscreen, at least every 2 hours.  NOTHING IS
   WATERPROOF.

   #3 – stay out of the sun when possible during peak hours (we say
   between 11 and 2)

   Stay safe out there, sun bunnies.  No one wants to look like leather
   when they’re old.

   Check out our previous sunscreen post, Caribbean Sun,,, Not For The
   Fair Of Skin, for more in depth information!

National Park Week: Go Wild!

   April 18, 2014
   tags: beach, caribbean, hiking, national park, USVI, VI National Park,
   VINP

   20140418-125249.jpg

   Among the many reasons St John is special, our National Park is surely
   a front runner.  Comprising 70% of our beautiful island, the Park is a
   major tourist attraction and also minimizes development and ensures
   that our beaches and trails will stay pristine.

   Every year the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation
   invite people nationwide to celebrate National Park Week, this year
   from April 19th to April 27th.  There are more than 400 National Parks
   nationwide, and people are encouraged to get out and explore them this
   week – Parks will even be waiving entrance fees on April 19th and 20th.
    (For the VINP on St John, our only entrance fee is at Trunk Bay).
   This year’s theme, “Go Wild!”, serves as a reminder to get out and
   enjoy the protected wilderness across the country, and to learn about
   the history, wildlife, and cultures represented in our National Parks.
    For more information, check out this article from nationalpark.org or
   watch this hilarious (at least to me) video they made to promote
   National Park Week:

   For those of you who are unfamiliar, here’s a little background on our
   Park here in St John:

   – It’s comprised of 7,000 acres, most of which was donated by
   conservationist Laurance Rockefeller to establish the Park in 1956.

   – The Park also has over 5,000 undersea acres of protected reef and
   other marine ecosystems.

   – Much of the island’s vegetation is second-growth, as vast portions of
   St John were clear cut in the colonial period to allow for the growth
   of sugar cane

   – Throughout history St John has been a nexus between Caribbean
   cultures, European exploration, and the African slave trade. The
   archaeology program within the VINP has been working to illuminate the
   fascinating history of St John.

   For more information, we recommend the VINP website and the St John
   Historical Society – both are great resources!
