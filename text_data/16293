   In the current careers climate, competition for jobs is fierce than
   ever before. Applications for some roles can run into the hundreds,
   sometimes thousands, so if your resume does not capture the employerâ€™s
   imagination, you can forget any chance of landing the job.
   Resume Fact 1 The resume is a weapon with one specific purpose: to win
   an interview.
   Your resume is a sales letter. Just like a house or car, you are a
   precious commodity and you need your resume to display your talents in
   the best possible light.
   Resume Fact 2 Your resume needs to be well presented and include all
   the relevant information.
   Over 70% of resumes are missing vital information and, as a result, are
   discarded by an employer.
   Resume Fact 3 Research on resume shows that your resume will be quickly
   scanned, rather than read.
   Research on resume also tells us that only one interview is granted for
   every 200 resumes received by the average employer. An attractive
   resume can put you amongst the favorites for the job, before youâ€™ve
   even arrived for interview.

   Right Here. Writing an effective resume is often a very daunting
   process. Knowing what information to include, how to structure the

   job interviews can be incredibly nerve-wracking and sometimes,
   confusing!<span id="more-2281"></span></p> <p>There are so many
   different job interview scenarios “ group job interviews, panel job
   interviews, Skype job interviews, face-to-face formal job
   interviews&#8230;there are so many job interview options and you could
   find yourself attending a variety of them! And with each job interview
   there is always the ˜preparation™. But when it comes to job interview
   etiquette and preparation, there are a few rules that you should stick
   to (no matter the job interview scenario!) in order to impress the
   employer. </p> <p>Here are our top tips to job interview etiquette
   which should hopefully help you win over an employer during your next
   job interview:</p> <p><strong>Be Punctual</strong></p> <p>Turning up to
   your interview on time or even early is one of the most important
   things when it comes to job interview day. Turning up and being
   punctual on job interview day will demonstrate that you are reliable
   and trustworthy “ two personality traits that employers find desirable
   in candidates. If however you turn up late then your interview will not
   start on the best foot “ the employer will automatically feel you are
   not that dedicated to the job interview and if they have only allocated
   a certain amount of time for your interview, it may even mean you won™t
   have that much time to impress them.</p> <p>To avoid this ensure you
   set your alarm clock, get plenty of rest before the day and plan your
   journey. An employer won™t want to hear that you got the bus time-table
   wrong or that you were stuck in traffic “ plan your route and ensure you
   turn up on time! </p> <p><strong>Dress Sense</strong></p> <p>During a
   job interview an employer will be judging you on first impressions so
   it™s crucial you make a good one! Dressing smart for a job interview
   will not only ensure a positive first impression but it will also
   demonstrate that you are genuinely interested in the job and the
   organisation. Ahead of your job interview consider looking at the
   company website and social feeds to get an idea of the company image to
   help you dress appropriately for the day. Researching the company
   before choosing an outfit is crucial &#8211; turning up to a job at
   Google in a shirt and tie may not be entirely appropriate but it would
   be the right choice if attending a job interview with a small,
   corporate company. Try to do as much research as possible to dress
   appropriately for the event.</p> <p><strong>Body Language</strong></p>
   <p>This is an area that many candidates don™t even consider but during a
   job interview an employer isn™t just listening to the questions and
   answers you are giving, they are looking at your overall body language
   to try and form an overall view of your character. A candidate™s <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/advice-and-news-articles/job-inter
   views/what-your-interview-body-language-says-about-you">body language
   during a job interview</a> can tell an employer a lot about that
   candidates work attitude and motivation which is why it™s so important
   to get it right! Negative body language which could hinder your chances
   of securing a second job interview include folding your arms, turning
   away from the interviewer, making very little eye contact, yawning and
   raising your eyebrows. Before your interview you should practice your
   job interview body language to ensure you are representing yourself in
   the best possible light. Positive body language moves include smiling,
   maintaining eye contact, nodding and turning towards the employer to
   keep an open and friendly frame “ practice it before you attend to help
   you build confidence.</p> <p><strong>Questions </strong></p> <p>During
   a job interview you will be answering a number of questions about the
   job role and your key skills but one of the main things to focus on
   during a job interview is also the questions you ask the employer. Many
   employers like candidates to ask questions during a job interview
   because it shows them that the candidate in question has done their
   research on the company and it also demonstrates that the candidate is
   genuinely interested in the role. To ensure you have plenty of
   questions to ask read through the job description and make notes based
   on the role and the responsibilities. Are there any responsibilities
   you need clarity on? Is there daily duty that you need more information
   about? Note down any questions you might have about the role. You
   should then look at the company website and write some questions based
   on the company™s history and overall ethos. Is there anything you want
   to ask about the future of the company? Is there anything you want to
   find out about the future goals and aspirations of the team you might
   be joining? Thinking about this before your interview will ensure you
   have plenty of questions to ask “ which is important to helping you
   decide whether it™s the right job for you. </p> <p>The post <a

   <p><span id="more-2276"></span></p> <p>But there are lots of ways you
   can improve your cover letter with very little effort “ here are three
   ways to instantly boost your cover letter content and hopefully your
   job interview chances too:</p> <p> <strong>Cut Down the
   Words</strong></p> <p> One of the quickest ways to improve your cover
   letter is to spend time on editing the content and decreasing the
   length of your document. Just like your resume, your cover letter
   should be concise “ ideally one page or less. A couple of paragraphs
   would be perfect. Your cover letter should briefly describe your
   current work experience and your expertise and briefly explain why you
   are looking to move jobs. If you write pages and pages of text for the
   cover letter it could be detrimental for a number of reasons. Firstly,
   you don™t want to give too much information away on your cover letter as
   you™ll struggle for talking points during a job interview. Your cover
   letter should simply serve as a teaser “ offering some initial career
   information to an employer and prompting them to want to find out more.
   So read through your cover letter and cut down any information that you
   feel goes into too much detail or is not that relevant to your job
   application. And secondly, creating a cover letter that is pages and
   pages long may mean your cover letter and resume isn™t read at all.
   Employers allocate a certain period of time for recruitment however as
   most employers can receive hundreds of resumes for every one advert
   they post, many employers have less time to spend to whittle down job
   applications. If your cover letter is too lengthy or doesn™t get
   straight to the good stuff, then an employer may skip it and move on to
   the next. You need to make your resume and experience as accessible as
   possible so include the key details of your expertise and keep it
   concise.</p> <p> <strong>Personalise It </strong></p> <p> If you are
   trying to improve your cover letter then one of the most effective ways
   to do this is to personalise it to the employer. If you have written a
   cover letter that doesn™t relate to the job role or the responsibilities
   then you are not showcasing your ability to do the job in the best
   possible light. Personalising your cover letter can not only
   demonstrate why you can do the job “ but it allows an employer to
   visualise what kind of impact you could have on their organisation and
   what you could bring to the job role. Personalising your cover letter
   can be easy too; find out the name of the hiring manager or the person
   conducting the interview and address your cover letter to them. Read
   through the job description and the key skills required for the role.
   Your resume should already reflect these skills but use your cover
   letter to further outline why you are qualified for the job by
   outlining examples of your work that the employer may find impressive
   or by reiterating your previous experience and expertise. Doing this
   will ensure the employer can easily see the value of your application
   and it should increase your job interview opportunities too.</p>
   <p><strong>Tell the Employer Something Your Resume Doesn™t</strong></p>
   <p> Although your cover letter should reference your resume, you should
   try to avoid repeating exactly what you have included on your resume.
   Use your cover letter to outline the specific skills and experience you
   have that make you the right candidate for the job and also try to show
   an employer why you want to work for their company. Although an
   employer will mainly be looking for your skills, qualifications and
   experience on your cover letter, they will also be looking for some
   passion and enthusiasm for the job “ so try to show this in your cover
   letter writing. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow"

   <p>State-by-state figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
   revealed that Texas added 46,600 in July making it the number one state
   for job growth and employment during July.</p> <p>During the previous
   month Texas had been second to Florida but managed to overtake the
   state for this latest set of employment results. The biggest hirers in
   Texas, the oil and gas and technology industries, are thought to be
   contributing factors to the job growth. With employees earning higher
   paid salaries in these industries, it™s suggested consumer spending
   increases and therefore demand for staff in the retail and hospitality
   sectors grow. </p> <p>The oil and gas industry has seen a 7.8% growth
   rate during the last 12 month but it wasn™t only the oil and gas and
   technology industries affected by the growth. Figures suggest Texas has
   seen an overall employment growth in all industries.</p> <p>In total,
   396, 200 jobs have been created in Texas during the past year but
   experts expect this figure to increase dramatically during the next
   year. Experts are forecasting that Texas will add 480, 000 jobs during
   the next year. </p> <p>It hasn™t been all good news in employment “ with
   some states making substantial job losses. Thirteen states lost jobs
   overall with Ohio seeing the biggest employment decline with over
   12,400 jobs lost throughout July. </p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow"

   of time on writing and creating a new resume, then it can be terribly
   frustrating if employers ignore your resume when it lands on their
   desk.<span id="more-2268"></span></p> <p>But this can happen “
   recruitment restraints, volume of applications and available time to
   read through resumes are all factors that could lead to an employer
   only skim-reading your resume or perhaps ignoring it all together.</p>
   <p>When spending time on creating your resume and job hunting it™s
   essential you get over that first hurdle and ensure employers read
   through you entire document and offering. Here are a few ways to
   increase the chances of your resume being read and hopefully increase
   the chances of a job interview too:</p> <p><strong>Keep It
   Concise</strong></p> <p>One of the easiest ways to ensure your resume
   gets read is to keep it concise and to the point. Most employers don™t
   have a lot of spare time to read through resumes and to whittle down a
   shortlist pile. Instead, most employers allocate a specific amount of
   time to recruitment (usually only a few hours per role) and once this
   is reached they stop their recruitment drive. If you are sending out
   your resume and it spans over several ages then you are really
   hindering your chances of an employer reading it. That™s because for
   every one job they advertise, an employer will receive dozens of
   applications. After reading a few resumes an employer will probably
   begin to tire of it and will start trying to skim-read applications in
   order to try and pick the most relevant resumes out of the pile. If
   yours is pages and pages of text then an employer will find it
   difficult to pinpoint the key information and may even get tired of
   trying to read it. To avoid this you need to keep your resume concise “
   two pages or less is a good size resume. You should include catchy
   sections, like bullet pointing your achievements, to show an employer
   why you are the right candidate for them. If they can pick this
   information up whilst skim-reading your resume then it™s more likely
   you™ll be invited to a job interview. </p> <p><strong>Make It
   Relevant</strong></p> <p>If you want an employer to be engrossed in
   your resume whilst reading it then you really need to make it relevant
   to them. An employer will feel disengaged if they start reading a
   resume that has nothing to do with their company ethos or the job role
   they are advertising for. To personalise your resume ensure that you
   read the job description of the role you are applying to. Highlight the
   main responsibilities of the job and the main skills that are needed to
   successfully fulfil the role. Look at your own resume and work
   experience and start to pick out the experience you have that proves
   you can handle the responsibilities and the key skills you have that
   you think an employer would find valuable. Personalising your resume to
   the job description will help an employer to visualise the impact you
   could have on their company and it will hold their interest when
   reading your application.</p> <p><strong>Make It Interesting to
   Read</strong></p> <p>Your resume should excite an employer and make
   them want to read on and there are a variety of ways you can do that.
   Personalising your resume to the employer is one way of making your
   resume interesting. If you can include specific information about the
   job role you are applying for and why you want to work for the company
   throughout your resume and cover letter, then you™re more likely to
   impress an employer. You can also use the hobbies section to add a bit
   of character to your resume. Including your interests outside of work
   can not only make your resume more interesting to read but it can
   create rapport between you and a possible employer. If they share

   <p>Although you may have more time on your hands to look for a job if
   you™re unemployed, looking for a job can be very difficult if you are
   out of work. Not only does it make updating your resume and explaining
   your current employment situation difficult, but receiving rejection
   after rejection can make you feel unmotivated. If you are looking for a
   job whilst unemployed, check out these career tips to help you get back
   into work:</p> <p><strong>Keep Your Resume Up To Date</strong></p>
   <p>When you are job searching you should try to keep your resume as up
   to date as possible. If you don™t keep your resume up to date then you
   may end up leaving vital bits of information out or you may even forget
   to include some work experience or information that could really
   benefit your job application. <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/advice-and-news-articles/resume-ad
   vice-tips">Keeping your resume up to date</a> also means that you are
   ready to send your resume out as soon as you see a vacancy. Quite often
   with job hunting, the successful candidates are the ones that send
   their application in as soon as possible. With so much competition out
   there for work you need to ensure that your resume is one of the first
   ones an employer sees. Keep it up to date by adding in any extra work
   experience you might do and assess your career objective and personal
   statement regularly to keep them as relevant to your current situation
   as possible. </p> <p>If you are sending your resume out without much
   response from employers then it could be worth assessing your resume
   content. Is it relevant to the job role and the company you are
   applying to? If it™s not then the employer might not feel that compelled
   to read it. Every time you apply for a new role read the job
   description and try to match the responsibilities of the role and the
   skills needed to your resume and own work experience. </p>
   <p><strong>Use Social Media</strong></p> <p>Social media can be a great
   tool when job searching as it can be used to find out about new
   opportunities and you can make valuable industry contacts. If you™re
   currently unemployed you should check social media sites like Twitter
   and Linked In on a daily basis and find out about new opportunities.
   Create a profile on social media, include a small biography and links
   to any other pages like a blog or website that you want employers to
   see and get chatting. The more you talk and interact on social media
   sites, the more you will get from it! </p> <p>A lot of companies now
   use social media to advertise their latest vacancies so having a social
   profile will mean you™ll find out about the latest vacancies first.
   Start searching for companies you would like to work for and follow
   them, comment on industry news and topical conversations and make
   industry connections to get the most out of social media.</p>
   <p><strong>Talk to Careers Advisors</strong></p> <p>Career advisors can
   be very helpful during a job search as they can help you to pinpoint
   your career strengths and weaknesses and find relevant job roles.
   Search for career advisors in your area and arrange a meeting. Local
   recruitment advisors are also valuable during a job search as they will
   have access to all of the latest job opportunities. </p>
   <p><strong>Volunteer </strong></p> <p>When unemployed it can be easy to
   get stuck in a rut which can hinder your resume content and your job
   confidence. If you are out of work for a long period of time it can be
   difficult to integrate into a working environment and it can be quite
   damaging to your overall confidence and career development. To avoid
   this you could try applying for voluntary roles or internships. The
   majority of charities look for volunteers all year round to help in a
   variety of roles so whether it™s gaining experience working outdoors or
   in an office environment, this can be very beneficial to your resume. A
   lot of companies offer internships for people looking to gain
   experience in a particular industry. Whilst internships are often
   unpaid or only pay expenses, they can be good work experience for your
   resume, can build your job confidence and can help you to meet industry
   contacts. Some internships and voluntary roles can even turn into
   employment if you impress during your time at the company so this is
   something to consider applying for whilst you look for a job.</p> <div

   <p><span id="more-2261"></span></p> <p>For those that struggle with
   resume length, there is always the temptation to leave sections out.
   Suddenly the key skills section can be left out, the education section
   can be shortened and the hobbies section is sometimes cut out
   completely. But when writing your resume you should try to leave as
   much information in as possible. By including sections like hobbies the
   employer reading your resume will have a much more rounded view of you
   as a candidate and will be able to visualise what kind of employee you
   would be. </p> <p> If you are editing your resume you should also try
   to include the achievements section. Although this might be one of the
   first sections you think about cutting, it can be beneficial to your
   overall resume and here™s why:</p> <p> <strong>It Gives a Snapshot of
   Your Career to Date</strong></p> <p> Your achievements will normally be
   a concise section “ a few bullet points including both career
   achievements and personal achievements that you are proud of. And this
   can be incredibly powerful on a resume. Firstly, as this section is so
   concise, it™s one of the easiest ways for an employer to pick up
   information about your expertise. A quick glance at the achievements
   section will show an employer what you are capable of in the work place
   and what you specialise in. It will also give them an idea of your
   personality too. If you include personal achievements, like running a
   half marathon, an employer will have a better idea about you as a
   candidate which can help them to decide whether you would be a good fit
   for their team. This section is one of the best ways to hook an
   employer in “ if they like the sound of your achievements, they are more
   likely to read your entire resume.</p> <p> <strong>It Shows an Employer
   What You Can Bring to Their Company</strong></p> <p> When hiring for a
   vacancy an employer will always have in mind what they are looking for.
   Whether they are looking for someone to bring in more sales, generate
   new customers or improve their customer service “ they will always think
   about this when reading a resume. If you can personalise your
   achievements to an employer™s specifications then your chances of being
   invited to a job interview greatly improve as an employer will be able
   to visualise the impact you could have on their organisation. For
   instance, if an employer is hiring for a Customer Service Manager they
   will probably be looking for someone to build rapport with their
   customers and improve customer retention. If you include achievements
   that reflect your customer service “ like an award you have gained or a
   particular customer story “ then the employer will be able to see the
   impact you could have on their business.</p> <p> <strong>It
   Demonstrates Your Passion for the Industry</strong></p> <p> If you
   write down your achievements then you are demonstrating that you are
   proud of them and you are passionate about your industry. Employers are
   always looking for candidates to show passion and dedication on a
   resume as it suggests that the candidate will be dedicated to the job
   &#8211; so by including your achievements on your resume you™re already
   displaying your passion and commitment to the industry which can only
   be a good thing!  </p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow"

   Statistics, outlines how the job market is improving throughout the
   country. Although the unemployment rate has slightly increased, the
   number of jobs available is growing month on month. </p> <p>It has been
   estimated that the US has to add around 150,000 new jobs every month to
   keep up with the growing population. But recent figures show that over
   200,000 jobs have been added every month during the past few months.
   And looking at July™s figures, that number doesn™t appear to be changing
   anytime soon.</p> <p>The economy grew by 4% during the period between
   April “ June. Although the number of unemployed has risen recently, this
   could be a good sign. Experts say people are only classed as unemployed
   if they are in the labor market and actively looking for work. These
   latest figures suggest that candidates who have previously given up on
   finding employment have joined the job search once again. </p> <p>The
   only figure that remains unchanged is the number of long-term
   unemployed people in America. The number of people that have been
   unemployed for six months or more remains at 3.2 million people. </p>

   for a job and finding it tough to secure a job interview? Or finding it
   tough to find vacancies full stop? The job market is so competitive
   that finding the right position and getting an employer to notice your
   resume is becoming increasingly difficult. If you™re wondering why your
   job search isn™t going to plan here are five reasons why it might be
   failing and some tips on how to revive it:<span
   id="more-2252"></span></p> <p><strong>Your Resume </strong></p> <p>If
   you are not receiving much response to your resume or have not been
   invited to a job interview then the first thing you need to assess is
   your <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/advice-and-news-articles/resume-ad
   vice-tips">resume writing</a>. Re-read your resume “ does your personal
   statement reflect your current expertise and offering? Does the career
   objective demonstrate how passionate you are about the industry? Does
   your work experience reflect your expertise? When applying for a job
   you should always try to personalise your resume to the role as the
   employer reading it will want to know what you can bring to their
   organisation and how you could fit in with their team. </p>
   <p><em>Tip:</em> Change your resume every time you apply for a job.
   Visit the website of the company you are applying to and make some
   notes on the company™s goals. Next, read the job description and
   identify the key skills needed to fulfil the role. With this
   information you can begin to tailor your resume writing to the job role
   “ by highlighting your key skills and work experience that you think the
   employer will find of interest. </p> <p><strong>You™re Ignoring Social
   Media</strong></p> <p>Social media is used by companies all over the
   country. Social media is used by companies to share company news,
   publicise a brand or product and companies also use it to look for
   potential candidates. A lot of companies use their social media pages
   to advertise job vacancies so if you are ignoring social media you
   could be missing out on a lot of work opportunities.</p>
   <p><em>Tip:</em> If you haven™t got a social media profile consider
   setting one up especially on sites like Twitter and Linked In which a
   lot of companies use. Create your profile and include links to any
   online work, like a career portfolio or blog, and get involved in
   conversation. Updating your profile with industry news, talking to
   potential industry contacts and following companies you are interested
   in working for are all ways you can improve your job search.</p>
   <p><strong>Avoiding Networking Events</strong> </p> <p>Networking
   events happen up and down the country and can provide a great
   opportunity to meet contacts and publicise your experience. If you™re
   not attending these events you could be missing out on a chance to have
   your resume read by a potential employer.</p> <p><em>Tip:</em> Find out
   about industry networking events and career events in your area. Print
   off copies of your resume, dress smart and attend these events. You
   never know, you may meet a valuable industry contact or you may even
   find out about work opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Cover
   Letter</strong></p> <p>Cover letters are a great addition to a resume
   as they can introduce your resume content and reiterate to an employer
   why they should hire you. If you™re missing a cover letter in your job
   application then an employer may find other resumes and cover letters
   more appealing.</p> <p><em>Tip:</em> You should create a cover letter
   every time you apply for a job. Find out the name of the hiring manager
   to personalise your cover letter and refer to the job role to include
   key information about yourself. A cover letter shouldn™t repeat your
   resume writing but it should outline your key skills and experience and
   draw attention to them on your resume and it should enhance the content
   by further explaining why you are the right candidate for the job. Use
   your cover letter to tell an employer why you want to work for them and
   why you think you are the right person for the job.</p> <p><strong>Not
   Updating Your Job Search</strong></p> <p>If you™re looking for
   employment, job searching is constant. But if you™re sending out your
   resume only once or twice a month (when you see a particular job
   vacancy) then you are massively hindering your chances of finding
   employment.</p> <p><em>Tip:</em> Keep updated with job news and local
   vacancies by reading industry publications and your local newspaper.
   Many of these will post job vacancies so it™s crucial you read them
   regularly. Keep up to date with online vacancies too by regularly
   logging into your social media profiles and by checking the websites of
   companies you would like to work for. By keeping up to date with
   vacancies you™ll probably find more of them to apply for. You should
   apply to every job role that is relevant to your experience and career
   development plan. The more vacancies you apply for, the more chance you
   have of hearing back from an employer.</p> <p>Happy job hunting!</p>

   for vacancies.<span id="more-2248"></span><br /> Some companies require
   a candidate to go through two job interviews before they will offer
   employment and some also organise group job interviews too. And there
   are a number of reasons why employers have multiple job interview
   stages. </p> <p>If you™ve been to an interview and have been invited
   back for a second one, here are a few possible reasons why:</p>
   <p><strong>Clarify Sections of Your Resume</strong></p> <p>If you have
   attended a first job interview with an employer recently then you™ll
   know this is an introductory stage. It™s the first time an employer will
   have had the opportunity to meet you face-to-face and to find out more
   about you as a candidate. During an initial job interview an employer
   will ask an array of questions based on your <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/">resume template</a> and they
   will ask questions about your resume content, work experience,
   achievements and career goals. But, as most job interviews are only
   scheduled for an hour or less, the employer won™t have much opportunity
   to delve too deeply into your career background and to find out why you
   want to work for them. A second job interview can give an employer the
   opportunity to find out more about you and how you could fit in with
   their team and it allows them to be more in-depth when it comes to
   asking job interview questions.</p> <p><strong>Group
   Interviews</strong></p> <p>Some companies like to include group
   interviews in their job interview process and this could be a reason
   why you have been invited back for a second interview. Group interviews
   usually consist of several potential candidates working in a workshop
   environment. Depending on the industry, group interviews can involve
   practical assessments, group interviews and group assignments. The main
   outcome of an interview like this is to assess how you interact with
   other candidates and to assess your team work skills. But it™s also an
   opportunity for the employer to see prospective candidates in a room
   together “ allowing the employer to assess each candidate thoroughly and
   to decide which one is right for the role.</p> <p><strong>Panel
   Interviews </strong></p> <p>During an initial job interview you™ll
   probably be faced with the Hiring Manager. But if you are invited back
   for a second interview it could be because other members of staff want
   to sit in on the meeting. Managing Directors, Directors and Direct Line
   Managers often get involved in the latter stages of the job interview
   process. A second interview gives senior members of staff the chance to
   find out about your expertise and skills and to decide whether you are
   the right candidate to join the team. </p> <p><strong>Ultimately, To
   Help Them Decide</strong></p> <p>If an employer has interviewed
   multiple candidates for the role and they have all demonstrated similar
   work experience and skills then a second interview will help the
   employer to make their decision and choose a candidate. Employers can
   find it incredibly difficult during the hiring process “ if they are
   impressed by a few candidates and only have one position available then
   it can be frustrating to try and shortlist the applicant pile. But a
   second interview can help an employer to find out more about each
   candidate and it can assure them that they are making the correct
   hiring decision.</p> <p><strong>Second Interview Tips:</strong></p> <p>¢
   Assess your previous job interview performance. This is vital as it can
   help you to assess what your strengths and weaknesses were during the
   interview. Look back on your job interview answers and list down some
   improvements you could make. Think about questions you were asked that
   you struggled with or areas of your resume that you didn™t discuss
   thoroughly. Note these down and prepare to talk about them in the next
   interview.</p> <p>¢ Be punctual. Just like your first job interview, you
   should allow for plenty of time to get to the venue. The second
   interview could involve multiple candidates or multiple staff members
   so, even though you may have already met the Hiring Manager previously,
   this is the first impression many people will get of you. So ensure it™s
   a good one.</p> <p>¢ Take your <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/blog/put-career-portfolio">career
   portfolio</a>. Your career portfolio can help you to demonstrate some
   of your successes and achievements listed on your resume and can help
   to demonstrate to the employer what impact you could have on their
   company. So whether it™s a portfolio of printed out facts and figures or
   an online blog you wish to showcase, ensure you take it to the
   interview.</p> <p>¢ Have some questions to ask. The second interview is
   an opportunity for an employer to find out more about you and how you
   could fit in with their company but it™s also an opportunity for you to
   find out more about the company. What™s the career progression like
   within the company? Are there regular team building events? How does
   this job role fit in with the business? These are just a few of the
   questions you should be asking to ensure this is the right career move
   for you. Remember, job interviews are a two-way street and you need to
   find out (just as much as the employer does) whether this is the right
   job for you.</p> <p>¢ Build rapport. The first interview can be
   nerve-wracking as many candidates are so focused on making a good
   impression and portraying their skills effectively. But the second
   interview is usually more relaxed and is an opportunity to build
   rapport with an employer “ and don™t ignore that. Ensure you create
   conversation, talk about your previous interview, find relatable
   subjects on your resume that you can mention and build rapport. Doing
   this will help you to stand out and should hopefully improve your
   chances of being offered the role.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow"

   job interviews can be incredibly nerve-wracking and sometimes,
   confusing!<span id="more-2281"></span></p> <p>There are so many
   different job interview scenarios “ group job interviews, panel job
   interviews, Skype job interviews, face-to-face formal job
   interviews&#8230;there are so many job interview options and you could
   find yourself attending a variety of them! And with each job interview
   there is always the ˜preparation™. But when it comes to job interview
   etiquette and preparation, there are a few rules that you should stick
   to (no matter the job interview scenario!) in order to impress the
   employer. </p> <p>Here are our top tips to job interview etiquette
   which should hopefully help you win over an employer during your next
   job interview:</p> <p><strong>Be Punctual</strong></p> <p>Turning up to
   your interview on time or even early is one of the most important
   things when it comes to job interview day. Turning up and being
   punctual on job interview day will demonstrate that you are reliable
   and trustworthy “ two personality traits that employers find desirable
   in candidates. If however you turn up late then your interview will not
   start on the best foot “ the employer will automatically feel you are
   not that dedicated to the job interview and if they have only allocated
   a certain amount of time for your interview, it may even mean you won™t
   have that much time to impress them.</p> <p>To avoid this ensure you
   set your alarm clock, get plenty of rest before the day and plan your
   journey. An employer won™t want to hear that you got the bus time-table
   wrong or that you were stuck in traffic “ plan your route and ensure you
   turn up on time! </p> <p><strong>Dress Sense</strong></p> <p>During a
   job interview an employer will be judging you on first impressions so
   it™s crucial you make a good one! Dressing smart for a job interview
   will not only ensure a positive first impression but it will also
   demonstrate that you are genuinely interested in the job and the
   organisation. Ahead of your job interview consider looking at the
   company website and social feeds to get an idea of the company image to
   help you dress appropriately for the day. Researching the company
   before choosing an outfit is crucial &#8211; turning up to a job at
   Google in a shirt and tie may not be entirely appropriate but it would
   be the right choice if attending a job interview with a small,
   corporate company. Try to do as much research as possible to dress
   appropriately for the event.</p> <p><strong>Body Language</strong></p>
   <p>This is an area that many candidates don™t even consider but during a
   job interview an employer isn™t just listening to the questions and
   answers you are giving, they are looking at your overall body language
   to try and form an overall view of your character. A candidate™s <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/advice-and-news-articles/job-inter
   views/what-your-interview-body-language-says-about-you">body language
   during a job interview</a> can tell an employer a lot about that
   candidates work attitude and motivation which is why it™s so important
   to get it right! Negative body language which could hinder your chances
   of securing a second job interview include folding your arms, turning
   away from the interviewer, making very little eye contact, yawning and
   raising your eyebrows. Before your interview you should practice your
   job interview body language to ensure you are representing yourself in
   the best possible light. Positive body language moves include smiling,
   maintaining eye contact, nodding and turning towards the employer to
   keep an open and friendly frame “ practice it before you attend to help
   you build confidence.</p> <p><strong>Questions </strong></p> <p>During
   a job interview you will be answering a number of questions about the
   job role and your key skills but one of the main things to focus on
   during a job interview is also the questions you ask the employer. Many
   employers like candidates to ask questions during a job interview
   because it shows them that the candidate in question has done their
   research on the company and it also demonstrates that the candidate is
   genuinely interested in the role. To ensure you have plenty of
   questions to ask read through the job description and make notes based
   on the role and the responsibilities. Are there any responsibilities
   you need clarity on? Is there daily duty that you need more information
   about? Note down any questions you might have about the role. You
   should then look at the company website and write some questions based
   on the company™s history and overall ethos. Is there anything you want
   to ask about the future of the company? Is there anything you want to
   find out about the future goals and aspirations of the team you might
   be joining? Thinking about this before your interview will ensure you
   have plenty of questions to ask “ which is important to helping you
   decide whether it™s the right job for you. </p> <p>The post <a

   <p><span id="more-2276"></span></p> <p>But there are lots of ways you
   can improve your cover letter with very little effort “ here are three
   ways to instantly boost your cover letter content and hopefully your
   job interview chances too:</p> <p> <strong>Cut Down the
   Words</strong></p> <p> One of the quickest ways to improve your cover
   letter is to spend time on editing the content and decreasing the
   length of your document. Just like your resume, your cover letter
   should be concise “ ideally one page or less. A couple of paragraphs
   would be perfect. Your cover letter should briefly describe your
   current work experience and your expertise and briefly explain why you
   are looking to move jobs. If you write pages and pages of text for the
   cover letter it could be detrimental for a number of reasons. Firstly,
   you don™t want to give too much information away on your cover letter as
   you™ll struggle for talking points during a job interview. Your cover
   letter should simply serve as a teaser “ offering some initial career
   information to an employer and prompting them to want to find out more.
   So read through your cover letter and cut down any information that you
   feel goes into too much detail or is not that relevant to your job
   application. And secondly, creating a cover letter that is pages and
   pages long may mean your cover letter and resume isn™t read at all.
   Employers allocate a certain period of time for recruitment however as
   most employers can receive hundreds of resumes for every one advert
   they post, many employers have less time to spend to whittle down job
   applications. If your cover letter is too lengthy or doesn™t get
   straight to the good stuff, then an employer may skip it and move on to
   the next. You need to make your resume and experience as accessible as
   possible so include the key details of your expertise and keep it
   concise.</p> <p> <strong>Personalise It </strong></p> <p> If you are
   trying to improve your cover letter then one of the most effective ways
   to do this is to personalise it to the employer. If you have written a
   cover letter that doesn™t relate to the job role or the responsibilities
   then you are not showcasing your ability to do the job in the best
   possible light. Personalising your cover letter can not only
   demonstrate why you can do the job “ but it allows an employer to
   visualise what kind of impact you could have on their organisation and
   what you could bring to the job role. Personalising your cover letter
   can be easy too; find out the name of the hiring manager or the person
   conducting the interview and address your cover letter to them. Read
   through the job description and the key skills required for the role.
   Your resume should already reflect these skills but use your cover
   letter to further outline why you are qualified for the job by
   outlining examples of your work that the employer may find impressive
   or by reiterating your previous experience and expertise. Doing this
   will ensure the employer can easily see the value of your application
   and it should increase your job interview opportunities too.</p>
   <p><strong>Tell the Employer Something Your Resume Doesn™t</strong></p>
   <p> Although your cover letter should reference your resume, you should
   try to avoid repeating exactly what you have included on your resume.
   Use your cover letter to outline the specific skills and experience you
   have that make you the right candidate for the job and also try to show
   an employer why you want to work for their company. Although an
   employer will mainly be looking for your skills, qualifications and
   experience on your cover letter, they will also be looking for some
   passion and enthusiasm for the job “ so try to show this in your cover
   letter writing. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow"

   <p>State-by-state figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
   revealed that Texas added 46,600 in July making it the number one state
   for job growth and employment during July.</p> <p>During the previous
   month Texas had been second to Florida but managed to overtake the
   state for this latest set of employment results. The biggest hirers in
   Texas, the oil and gas and technology industries, are thought to be
   contributing factors to the job growth. With employees earning higher
   paid salaries in these industries, it™s suggested consumer spending
   increases and therefore demand for staff in the retail and hospitality
   sectors grow. </p> <p>The oil and gas industry has seen a 7.8% growth
   rate during the last 12 month but it wasn™t only the oil and gas and
   technology industries affected by the growth. Figures suggest Texas has
   seen an overall employment growth in all industries.</p> <p>In total,
   396, 200 jobs have been created in Texas during the past year but
   experts expect this figure to increase dramatically during the next
   year. Experts are forecasting that Texas will add 480, 000 jobs during
   the next year. </p> <p>It hasn™t been all good news in employment “ with
   some states making substantial job losses. Thirteen states lost jobs

   of time on writing and creating a new resume, then it can be terribly
   frustrating if employers ignore your resume when it lands on their
   desk.<span id="more-2268"></span></p> <p>But this can happen “
   recruitment restraints, volume of applications and available time to
   read through resumes are all factors that could lead to an employer
   only skim-reading your resume or perhaps ignoring it all together.</p>
   <p>When spending time on creating your resume and job hunting it™s
   essential you get over that first hurdle and ensure employers read
   through you entire document and offering. Here are a few ways to
   increase the chances of your resume being read and hopefully increase
   the chances of a job interview too:</p> <p><strong>Keep It
   Concise</strong></p> <p>One of the easiest ways to ensure your resume
   gets read is to keep it concise and to the point. Most employers don™t
   have a lot of spare time to read through resumes and to whittle down a
   shortlist pile. Instead, most employers allocate a specific amount of
   time to recruitment (usually only a few hours per role) and once this
   is reached they stop their recruitment drive. If you are sending out
   your resume and it spans over several ages then you are really
   hindering your chances of an employer reading it. That™s because for
   every one job they advertise, an employer will receive dozens of
   applications. After reading a few resumes an employer will probably
   begin to tire of it and will start trying to skim-read applications in
   order to try and pick the most relevant resumes out of the pile. If
   yours is pages and pages of text then an employer will find it
   difficult to pinpoint the key information and may even get tired of
   trying to read it. To avoid this you need to keep your resume concise “
   two pages or less is a good size resume. You should include catchy
   sections, like bullet pointing your achievements, to show an employer
   why you are the right candidate for them. If they can pick this
   information up whilst skim-reading your resume then it™s more likely
   you™ll be invited to a job interview. </p> <p><strong>Make It
   Relevant</strong></p> <p>If you want an employer to be engrossed in
   your resume whilst reading it then you really need to make it relevant
   to them. An employer will feel disengaged if they start reading a
   resume that has nothing to do with their company ethos or the job role
   they are advertising for. To personalise your resume ensure that you
   read the job description of the role you are applying to. Highlight the
   main responsibilities of the job and the main skills that are needed to
   successfully fulfil the role. Look at your own resume and work
   experience and start to pick out the experience you have that proves
   you can handle the responsibilities and the key skills you have that
   you think an employer would find valuable. Personalising your resume to
   the job description will help an employer to visualise the impact you
   could have on their company and it will hold their interest when
   reading your application.</p> <p><strong>Make It Interesting to
   Read</strong></p> <p>Your resume should excite an employer and make
   them want to read on and there are a variety of ways you can do that.
   Personalising your resume to the employer is one way of making your
   resume interesting. If you can include specific information about the
   job role you are applying for and why you want to work for the company
   throughout your resume and cover letter, then you™re more likely to
   impress an employer. You can also use the hobbies section to add a bit
   of character to your resume. Including your interests outside of work
   can not only make your resume more interesting to read but it can
   create rapport between you and a possible employer. If they share
   similar hobbies then this may well improve your conversation “ if you
   progress to the interview stage.</p> <div align="center"><iframe

   <p>Although you may have more time on your hands to look for a job if
   you™re unemployed, looking for a job can be very difficult if you are
   out of work. Not only does it make updating your resume and explaining
   your current employment situation difficult, but receiving rejection
   after rejection can make you feel unmotivated. If you are looking for a
   job whilst unemployed, check out these career tips to help you get back
   into work:</p> <p><strong>Keep Your Resume Up To Date</strong></p>
   <p>When you are job searching you should try to keep your resume as up
   to date as possible. If you don™t keep your resume up to date then you
   may end up leaving vital bits of information out or you may even forget
   to include some work experience or information that could really
   benefit your job application. <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/advice-and-news-articles/resume-ad
   vice-tips">Keeping your resume up to date</a> also means that you are
   ready to send your resume out as soon as you see a vacancy. Quite often
   with job hunting, the successful candidates are the ones that send
   their application in as soon as possible. With so much competition out
   there for work you need to ensure that your resume is one of the first
   ones an employer sees. Keep it up to date by adding in any extra work
   experience you might do and assess your career objective and personal
   statement regularly to keep them as relevant to your current situation
   as possible. </p> <p>If you are sending your resume out without much
   response from employers then it could be worth assessing your resume
   content. Is it relevant to the job role and the company you are
   applying to? If it™s not then the employer might not feel that compelled
   to read it. Every time you apply for a new role read the job
   description and try to match the responsibilities of the role and the
   skills needed to your resume and own work experience. </p>
   <p><strong>Use Social Media</strong></p> <p>Social media can be a great
   tool when job searching as it can be used to find out about new
   opportunities and you can make valuable industry contacts. If you™re
   currently unemployed you should check social media sites like Twitter
   and Linked In on a daily basis and find out about new opportunities.
   Create a profile on social media, include a small biography and links
   to any other pages like a blog or website that you want employers to
   see and get chatting. The more you talk and interact on social media
   sites, the more you will get from it! </p> <p>A lot of companies now
   use social media to advertise their latest vacancies so having a social
   profile will mean you™ll find out about the latest vacancies first.
   Start searching for companies you would like to work for and follow
   them, comment on industry news and topical conversations and make
   industry connections to get the most out of social media.</p>
   <p><strong>Talk to Careers Advisors</strong></p> <p>Career advisors can
   be very helpful during a job search as they can help you to pinpoint
   your career strengths and weaknesses and find relevant job roles.
   Search for career advisors in your area and arrange a meeting. Local
   recruitment advisors are also valuable during a job search as they will
   have access to all of the latest job opportunities. </p>
   <p><strong>Volunteer </strong></p> <p>When unemployed it can be easy to
   get stuck in a rut which can hinder your resume content and your job
   confidence. If you are out of work for a long period of time it can be
   difficult to integrate into a working environment and it can be quite
   damaging to your overall confidence and career development. To avoid
   this you could try applying for voluntary roles or internships. The
   majority of charities look for volunteers all year round to help in a
   variety of roles so whether it™s gaining experience working outdoors or
   in an office environment, this can be very beneficial to your resume. A
   lot of companies offer internships for people looking to gain
   experience in a particular industry. Whilst internships are often
   unpaid or only pay expenses, they can be good work experience for your
   resume, can build your job confidence and can help you to meet industry
   contacts. Some internships and voluntary roles can even turn into
   employment if you impress during your time at the company so this is
   something to consider applying for whilst you look for a job.</p> <div

   <p><span id="more-2261"></span></p> <p>For those that struggle with
   resume length, there is always the temptation to leave sections out.
   Suddenly the key skills section can be left out, the education section
   can be shortened and the hobbies section is sometimes cut out
   completely. But when writing your resume you should try to leave as
   much information in as possible. By including sections like hobbies the
   employer reading your resume will have a much more rounded view of you
   as a candidate and will be able to visualise what kind of employee you
   would be. </p> <p> If you are editing your resume you should also try
   to include the achievements section. Although this might be one of the
   first sections you think about cutting, it can be beneficial to your
   overall resume and here™s why:</p> <p> <strong>It Gives a Snapshot of
   Your Career to Date</strong></p> <p> Your achievements will normally be
   a concise section “ a few bullet points including both career
   achievements and personal achievements that you are proud of. And this
   can be incredibly powerful on a resume. Firstly, as this section is so
   concise, it™s one of the easiest ways for an employer to pick up
   information about your expertise. A quick glance at the achievements
   section will show an employer what you are capable of in the work place
   and what you specialise in. It will also give them an idea of your
   personality too. If you include personal achievements, like running a
   half marathon, an employer will have a better idea about you as a
   candidate which can help them to decide whether you would be a good fit
   for their team. This section is one of the best ways to hook an
   employer in “ if they like the sound of your achievements, they are more
   likely to read your entire resume.</p> <p> <strong>It Shows an Employer
   What You Can Bring to Their Company</strong></p> <p> When hiring for a
   vacancy an employer will always have in mind what they are looking for.
   Whether they are looking for someone to bring in more sales, generate
   new customers or improve their customer service “ they will always think
   about this when reading a resume. If you can personalise your
   achievements to an employer™s specifications then your chances of being
   invited to a job interview greatly improve as an employer will be able
   to visualise the impact you could have on their organisation. For
   instance, if an employer is hiring for a Customer Service Manager they
   will probably be looking for someone to build rapport with their
   customers and improve customer retention. If you include achievements
   that reflect your customer service “ like an award you have gained or a
   particular customer story “ then the employer will be able to see the
   impact you could have on their business.</p> <p> <strong>It
   Demonstrates Your Passion for the Industry</strong></p> <p> If you
   write down your achievements then you are demonstrating that you are
   proud of them and you are passionate about your industry. Employers are
   always looking for candidates to show passion and dedication on a
   resume as it suggests that the candidate will be dedicated to the job
   &#8211; so by including your achievements on your resume you™re already
   displaying your passion and commitment to the industry which can only
   be a good thing!  </p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow"

   Statistics, outlines how the job market is improving throughout the
   country. Although the unemployment rate has slightly increased, the
   number of jobs available is growing month on month. </p> <p>It has been
   estimated that the US has to add around 150,000 new jobs every month to
   keep up with the growing population. But recent figures show that over
   200,000 jobs have been added every month during the past few months.
   And looking at July™s figures, that number doesn™t appear to be changing
   anytime soon.</p> <p>The economy grew by 4% during the period between
   April “ June. Although the number of unemployed has risen recently, this
   could be a good sign. Experts say people are only classed as unemployed
   if they are in the labor market and actively looking for work. These
   latest figures suggest that candidates who have previously given up on
   finding employment have joined the job search once again. </p> <p>The
   only figure that remains unchanged is the number of long-term
   unemployed people in America. The number of people that have been
   unemployed for six months or more remains at 3.2 million people. </p>

   for a job and finding it tough to secure a job interview? Or finding it
   tough to find vacancies full stop? The job market is so competitive
   that finding the right position and getting an employer to notice your
   resume is becoming increasingly difficult. If you™re wondering why your
   job search isn™t going to plan here are five reasons why it might be
   failing and some tips on how to revive it:<span
   id="more-2252"></span></p> <p><strong>Your Resume </strong></p> <p>If
   you are not receiving much response to your resume or have not been
   invited to a job interview then the first thing you need to assess is
   your <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/advice-and-news-articles/resume-ad
   vice-tips">resume writing</a>. Re-read your resume “ does your personal
   statement reflect your current expertise and offering? Does the career
   objective demonstrate how passionate you are about the industry? Does
   your work experience reflect your expertise? When applying for a job
   you should always try to personalise your resume to the role as the
   employer reading it will want to know what you can bring to their
   organisation and how you could fit in with their team. </p>
   <p><em>Tip:</em> Change your resume every time you apply for a job.
   Visit the website of the company you are applying to and make some
   notes on the company™s goals. Next, read the job description and
   identify the key skills needed to fulfil the role. With this
   information you can begin to tailor your resume writing to the job role
   “ by highlighting your key skills and work experience that you think the
   employer will find of interest. </p> <p><strong>You™re Ignoring Social
   Media</strong></p> <p>Social media is used by companies all over the
   country. Social media is used by companies to share company news,
   publicise a brand or product and companies also use it to look for
   potential candidates. A lot of companies use their social media pages
   to advertise job vacancies so if you are ignoring social media you
   could be missing out on a lot of work opportunities.</p>
   <p><em>Tip:</em> If you haven™t got a social media profile consider
   setting one up especially on sites like Twitter and Linked In which a
   lot of companies use. Create your profile and include links to any
   online work, like a career portfolio or blog, and get involved in
   conversation. Updating your profile with industry news, talking to
   potential industry contacts and following companies you are interested
   in working for are all ways you can improve your job search.</p>
   <p><strong>Avoiding Networking Events</strong> </p> <p>Networking
   events happen up and down the country and can provide a great
   opportunity to meet contacts and publicise your experience. If you™re
   not attending these events you could be missing out on a chance to have
   your resume read by a potential employer.</p> <p><em>Tip:</em> Find out
   about industry networking events and career events in your area. Print
   off copies of your resume, dress smart and attend these events. You
   never know, you may meet a valuable industry contact or you may even
   find out about work opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Cover
   Letter</strong></p> <p>Cover letters are a great addition to a resume
   as they can introduce your resume content and reiterate to an employer
   why they should hire you. If you™re missing a cover letter in your job
   application then an employer may find other resumes and cover letters
   more appealing.</p> <p><em>Tip:</em> You should create a cover letter
   every time you apply for a job. Find out the name of the hiring manager
   to personalise your cover letter and refer to the job role to include
   key information about yourself. A cover letter shouldn™t repeat your
   resume writing but it should outline your key skills and experience and
   draw attention to them on your resume and it should enhance the content
   by further explaining why you are the right candidate for the job. Use
   your cover letter to tell an employer why you want to work for them and
   why you think you are the right person for the job.</p> <p><strong>Not
   Updating Your Job Search</strong></p> <p>If you™re looking for
   employment, job searching is constant. But if you™re sending out your
   resume only once or twice a month (when you see a particular job
   vacancy) then you are massively hindering your chances of finding
   employment.</p> <p><em>Tip:</em> Keep updated with job news and local
   vacancies by reading industry publications and your local newspaper.
   Many of these will post job vacancies so it™s crucial you read them
   regularly. Keep up to date with online vacancies too by regularly
   logging into your social media profiles and by checking the websites of
   companies you would like to work for. By keeping up to date with
   vacancies you™ll probably find more of them to apply for. You should
   apply to every job role that is relevant to your experience and career
   development plan. The more vacancies you apply for, the more chance you
   have of hearing back from an employer.</p> <p>Happy job hunting!</p>

   companies organise multiple job interviews when interviewing candidates
   for vacancies.<span id="more-2248"></span><br /> Some companies require
   a candidate to go through two job interviews before they will offer
   employment and some also organise group job interviews too. And there
   are a number of reasons why employers have multiple job interview
   stages. </p> <p>If you™ve been to an interview and have been invited
   back for a second one, here are a few possible reasons why:</p>
   <p><strong>Clarify Sections of Your Resume</strong></p> <p>If you have
   attended a first job interview with an employer recently then you™ll
   know this is an introductory stage. It™s the first time an employer will
   have had the opportunity to meet you face-to-face and to find out more
   about you as a candidate. During an initial job interview an employer
   will ask an array of questions based on your <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/">resume template</a> and they
   will ask questions about your resume content, work experience,
   achievements and career goals. But, as most job interviews are only
   scheduled for an hour or less, the employer won™t have much opportunity
   to delve too deeply into your career background and to find out why you
   want to work for them. A second job interview can give an employer the
   opportunity to find out more about you and how you could fit in with
   their team and it allows them to be more in-depth when it comes to
   asking job interview questions.</p> <p><strong>Group
   Interviews</strong></p> <p>Some companies like to include group
   interviews in their job interview process and this could be a reason
   why you have been invited back for a second interview. Group interviews
   usually consist of several potential candidates working in a workshop
   environment. Depending on the industry, group interviews can involve
   practical assessments, group interviews and group assignments. The main
   outcome of an interview like this is to assess how you interact with
   other candidates and to assess your team work skills. But it™s also an
   opportunity for the employer to see prospective candidates in a room
   together “ allowing the employer to assess each candidate thoroughly and
   to decide which one is right for the role.</p> <p><strong>Panel
   Interviews </strong></p> <p>During an initial job interview you™ll
   probably be faced with the Hiring Manager. But if you are invited back
   for a second interview it could be because other members of staff want
   to sit in on the meeting. Managing Directors, Directors and Direct Line
   Managers often get involved in the latter stages of the job interview
   process. A second interview gives senior members of staff the chance to
   find out about your expertise and skills and to decide whether you are
   the right candidate to join the team. </p> <p><strong>Ultimately, To
   Help Them Decide</strong></p> <p>If an employer has interviewed
   multiple candidates for the role and they have all demonstrated similar
   work experience and skills then a second interview will help the
   employer to make their decision and choose a candidate. Employers can
   find it incredibly difficult during the hiring process “ if they are
   impressed by a few candidates and only have one position available then
   it can be frustrating to try and shortlist the applicant pile. But a
   second interview can help an employer to find out more about each
   candidate and it can assure them that they are making the correct
   hiring decision.</p> <p><strong>Second Interview Tips:</strong></p> <p>¢
   Assess your previous job interview performance. This is vital as it can
   help you to assess what your strengths and weaknesses were during the
   interview. Look back on your job interview answers and list down some
   improvements you could make. Think about questions you were asked that
   you struggled with or areas of your resume that you didn™t discuss
   thoroughly. Note these down and prepare to talk about them in the next
   interview.</p> <p>¢ Be punctual. Just like your first job interview, you
   should allow for plenty of time to get to the venue. The second
   interview could involve multiple candidates or multiple staff members
   so, even though you may have already met the Hiring Manager previously,
   this is the first impression many people will get of you. So ensure it™s
   a good one.</p> <p>¢ Take your <a
   href="https://www.resume-surgeon.com/blog/put-career-portfolio">career
   portfolio</a>. Your career portfolio can help you to demonstrate some
   of your successes and achievements listed on your resume and can help
   to demonstrate to the employer what impact you could have on their
   company. So whether it™s a portfolio of printed out facts and figures or
   an online blog you wish to showcase, ensure you take it to the
   interview.</p> <p>¢ Have some questions to ask. The second interview is
   an opportunity for an employer to find out more about you and how you
   could fit in with their company but it™s also an opportunity for you to
   find out more about the company. What™s the career progression like
   within the company? Are there regular team building events? How does
   this job role fit in with the business? These are just a few of the
   questions you should be asking to ensure this is the right career move
   for you. Remember, job interviews are a two-way street and you need to
   find out (just as much as the employer does) whether this is the right
   job for you.</p> <p>¢ Build rapport. The first interview can be
   nerve-wracking as many candidates are so focused on making a good
   impression and portraying their skills effectively. But the second
   interview is usually more relaxed and is an opportunity to build
   rapport with an employer “ and don™t ignore that. Ensure you create
   conversation, talk about your previous interview, find relatable
   subjects on your resume that you can mention and build rapport. Doing
   this will help you to stand out and should hopefully improve your
   chances of being offered the role.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow"
