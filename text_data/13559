       assistance, please send questions to certifications@wi-fi.org.
     * How do I know if the Wi-Fi module or system used in our product has
       been Wi-Fi CERTIFIED?
       Please visit our Product Finder to search for certified products
       and associated certifications, or consult with your Wi-Fi module
       manufacturer for their certification details.
     * Are Wi-Fi CERTIFIED products protected by security?
       Yes. All Wi-Fi CERTIFIED products are tested for WPA2 or WPA3. The
       only way to be sure that a product meets the latest security
       standards is to purchase only Wi-Fi CERTIFIED products.

     * How does Wi-Fi Alliance help ensure product compatibility and a
       good user experience for certified products?
       Compatibility and quality are achieved through rigorous testing of
       Wi-Fi products. Consumers should always look for the Wi-Fi
       CERTIFIED logo to ensure the best user experience possible.

     * What is the benefit of MU-MIMO?
       MU-MIMO is an innovative breakthrough that enables simultaneous
       communication to multiple devices, improving overall speed and
       enabling network multitasking.
     * How can I upgrade my device to use wave 2 features?
       Upgrading devices to use wave 2 features is implementation
       dependent. Some devices can be upgraded through software, but most
       will require new hardware.
     * What performance advances are enabled by Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac?
       Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac enables higher data rates, higher capacity and
       lower latency.  Products implementing the technology behind Wi-Fi
       CERTIFIED ac with wave 2 features are capable of multi-gigabit data
       rates– nearly triple that of devices implementing only wave 1
       features.
     * What new applications are enabled with Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac?
       Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac handles today’s demanding applications and paves
       the way for new applications in the future.  Certified-ac devices
       are more robust and offer a greater user experience including:
          + Transferring an HD movie to a tablet in under 4 minutes
          + Sharing photo albums with friends in seconds
          + Streaming three HD quality videos at one time
       Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac devices also improve wireless performance in the
       enterprise in the following ways:
          + Enhanced user experience for teleconference meetings
          + Delivering greater in-office networking coverage – more
            clients for the same number of APs per office area
          + Projecting graphics, video and audio to a large screen in a
            conference room or auditorium
     * Are Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac devices dual-band?
       Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac operates in the 5 GHz band, but devices support
       the 2.4 GHz band by integrating Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n.  Dual-band
       devices switch between the more crowded but popular 2.4 GHz
       frequency band, to the cleaner 5 GHz frequency band to connect more
       demanding applications and avoid interference from other devices.
     * Is Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac interoperable with previous versions of
       Wi-Fi?
       As with all Wi-Fi CERTIFIED devices, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac products
       are tested to ensure interoperability with legacy Wi-Fi CERTIFIED
       products. Products must operate in the same frequency band in order
       to connect.
     * What is WMM?
       Wi-Fi Multimedia, represented by the acronym WMM, is related to
       Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WMM^® programs. These optional certifications
       provide multimedia enhancements for Wi-Fi networks that improve the
       user experience for audio, video, and voice applications.

     * How does a user turn on WMM-Power Save?
       If implemented correctly, WMM-Power Save will activate
       automatically when a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ for WMM-Power Save client
       device is communicating with a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ for WMM-Power Save
       access point. There is no action needed from a user.

   or other agent of a member or other company or individual, you
   acknowledge that you are authorized to make the Blog Post and that you
   and the company or individual for which you are making the Blog Post
   are solely responsible for its content.  If you are making the Blog

   that are offensive, threatening, abusive, potentially harmful, or
   malicious.  Neither the submission of the Blog Post nor its
   unrestricted public use will violate any rights of a third party,
   including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights (such
   as and without limitation, any copyrights, trademark rights, or trade
   secret rights) or other proprietary rights (such as, and without
   limitation, any contractual rights or any personal rights or interests

            conference room or auditorium
     * Are Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac devices dual-band?
       Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac operates in the 5 GHz band, but devices support
       the 2.4 GHz band by integrating Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n.  Dual-band
       devices switch between the more crowded but popular 2.4 GHz
       frequency band, to the cleaner 5 GHz frequency band to connect more
       demanding applications and avoid interference from other devices.
     * Is Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac interoperable with previous versions of
       Wi-Fi?
       As with all Wi-Fi CERTIFIED devices, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac products
       are tested to ensure interoperability with legacy Wi-Fi CERTIFIED
       products. Products must operate in the same frequency band in order
       to connect.
     * What is WMM?
       Wi-Fi Multimedia, represented by the acronym WMM, is related to
       Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WMM^® programs. These optional certifications
       provide multimedia enhancements for Wi-Fi networks that improve the
       user experience for audio, video, and voice applications.

     * How does a user turn on WMM-Power Save?
       If implemented correctly, WMM-Power Save will activate
       automatically when a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ for WMM-Power Save client
       device is communicating with a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ for WMM-Power Save
       access point. There is no action needed from a user.
