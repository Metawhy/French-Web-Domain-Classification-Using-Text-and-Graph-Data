In Praise of Mary

   For the Month of May
   [b8ffc2a23ae934334475e00910e8376b.jpg]
   I fain would sing a sweet new song
   Thy loving Heart to greet,
   I fain would cull the flowers fair,
   And lay them at thy feet.
   And of the precious virgin-gold
   And shining jewels rare,
   Would form a royal diadem,
   To grace thy forehead fair.
   But ah! The heart-strings seem unstrung
   And faint the music now,
   I cannot place a golden crown
   Upon thy queenly brow.
   The first flowers fade too soon --
   What shall the offerings be
   From this poor exiled child of earth
   O purest Heart, to thee?
   I offer all the burning love
   Of Jesus' Heart for thine,
   And in the golden censer place
   The little spark of mine.
   And these, O Heart Immaculate,
   Shall be my gifts to thee;
   Oh I pray thy sweetest Son to grant
   His love and thine to me.

Gifts

   Don't forget to look!
   Wonder is everywhere, little gifts from God -- like when your Mom
   leaves a note in your lunchbox with hearts on it and a twinky. But
   better.

May!

The Month of Mary

   [FB_IMG_1556716217440.jpg]
   A LITTLE LITANY
   When God turned back eternity and was young,
   Ancient of Days, grown little for your mirth
   (As under the low arch the land is bright)
   Peered through you, gate of heaven – and saw the earth.
   Or shutting out his shining skies awhile
   Built you about him for a house of gold
   To see in pictured walls his storied world
   Return upon him as a tale is told.
   Or found his mirror there; the only glass
   That would not break with that unbearable light
   Till in a corner of the high dark house
   God looked on God, as ghosts meet in the night.
   Star of his morning; that unfallen star
   In that strange starry overturn of space
   When earth and sky changed places for an hour
   And heaven looked upwards in a human face.
   Or young on your strong knees and lifted up
   Wisdom cried out, whose voice is in the street,
   And more than twilight of twiformed cherubim
   Made of his throne indeed a mercy-seat.
   Or risen from play at your pale raiment’s hem
   God, grown adventurous from all time’s repose,
   Of your tall body climbed the ivory tower
   And kissed upon your mouth the mystic rose.
   – G.K. Chesterton

Gearing Up For Holy Week

   Starting on Spy Wednesday...
   So called because this marks the day in the life of Christ that Judas
   bargained to become the spy of the Sanhedrin, the Church celebrates the
   Tenebrae service, the remote beginning, actually, of the Sacred
   Triduum.
   Every priest who is able makes the drive to the home parish here in
   Omaha. Immaculate Queen is the home of their seminary days, the place
   where most of the priest we know were ordained, the home parish of our
   bishop -- and being so, it's the church where certain ceremonies are
   performed that you rarely see elsewhere -- in the world.
   From Fisheaters:
   Today and during the Sacred Triduum, the Matins and Lauds of the Divine
   Office are often sung in a haunting service known as the Tenebrae
   service ("tenebrae" meaning "shadows"), which is basically a funeral
   service for Jesus. During the Matins on Good Friday, one by one, the
   candles are extinguished in the Church, leaving the congregation in
   total darkness, and in a silence that is punctuated by the strepitus
   meant to evoke the convulsion of nature at the death of Christ. It has
   also been described as the sound of the tomb door closing. During the
   Triduum, the Matins and Lauds readings come from the following day's
   readings each night because the hours of Matins and Lauds were pushed
   back so that the public might better participate during these special
   three days (i.e., the Matins and Lauds readings heard at Spy
   Wednesday's tenebrae service are those for Maundy Thursday, the
   readings for Maundy Thursday's tenebrae service are from Good Friday,
   and Good Friday's readings are from Holy Saturday's Divine Office).
   There are few things more impressive than Tenebrae; just trust me on
   this. The extinguishing of the candles followed by the stepitus… Spine
   tingling, y'all! And the perfect start to the Triduum in a way you can
   only understand by experiencing it. Fr. Philip will be driving down
   from Minnesota to participate in Tenebrae, though he'll head back to
   his own parish for Holy Thursday Mass, of course. We look forward to
   seeing him!
   This year will be a strange year for us, though, and I'm afraid the
   first year of figuring out a new routine. For most of our family life,
   I've had a regiment of helpers for all the doings of Holy Week, but I'm
   afraid that is a thing of the past. Cathy works almost every day this
   week, Anna has school, and Gabriel and William will be in Idaho at the
   Minor Seminar for Easter. It was just too much of an expense for too
   short a time, too close to the end of school to justify flying them
   home. (Alas!) So, we're short-handed, and the element from the
   following Holy Week to-do list that will probably disappear is the
   spring cleaning. I expect I'll get some of it done myself -- but I'm
   not going to fret if I don't. The material preparation is nice -- and
   definitely symbolic -- but the spiritual preparation is far more
   important.
   Here's our family routine for a normal year:
   Spy Wednesday
   *Spring cleaning:
   Remove all the extraneous decorations around our statues, take down any
   winter decorations, including the Palm Sunday picture we hung on
   Sunday. Take our winter throw blankets out of their corners (we have
   tons!), wash them, and store them; strip all bedding and wash; clean
   out the wood stove and store the wood basket until next fall. Sweep
   thoroughly (every nook and crevice), mop, clean the windows; clean
   couches and upholstered chairs; scrub dining room table and chairs
   * Pretzel making to prepare for Maundy Thursday! (see below)
   Maundy Thursday
   *Finish up any cleaning left undone
   *Supper:
   between 2 and 3 pm to accommodate fasting for Maundy Thursday Mass
   Lamb , asparagus with hollandaise, herbed fingerling potatoes, savory
   hot cross buns
   or
   a favorite of recent years: lamb curry with hot cross buns (our
   non-sweet version), and  wine
   At the dinner table, everyone has a glass of wine (or Sprite with a
   drop of wine) and by Dan's plate we place a basket of hot cross buns
   (actually in our house they are rolls with a cross cut into the top
   before baking). After we pray grace, Dan makes the sign of the cross
   over each bun and hands it down the line until each member of the
   family has one. Then we eat our buns and drink our wine while Dan reads
   the Gospel of the Last Supper. After which we enjoy the rest of the
   meal. Then, Mass in the evening, after which we take a couple shifts at
   all night a doration.
   Good Friday
   Friday is a quiet day. As much as we are able, we speak in quiet voices
   and as little as possible, in memory of the solemn events in Christ's
   life on good Friday.  We'll attend the Tre Ore between noon and three.
   When we come home, we'll have the remainder of the Hot Cross buns with
   a simple clear broth vegetable soup that we've prepared ahead of time.
   Then we'll watch the first part of Jesus of Nazareth, followed by The
   Passion.
   Holy Saturday
   * Preparation and decoration day. If we didn't watch it on Friday,
   we'll watch Jesus of Nazareth while we work this day. We'll bring out
   our spring wreaths and decorations. Deck out Our Lady's special niche
   with flowers and ribbons. Make sure everyone's Easter clothes are
   pressed and ready to go for Easter Mass. I may or may not be able to
   talk the kids into coloring eggs; it's less important now than it used
   to be. But I will prepare Easter goodies (i.e., sweets!), and begin
   work on the Easter feast.
   I'm hoping that Dominic and Monica, who are visiting during Holy Week
   with newest grandbaby, sweet Margaret, will decorate the chalk door for
   Easter. That'll be a treat. Those two are some kinda creative!
   * Then, the 10:30 Paschal Vigil
   Easter Sunday
   * ...begins for us at midnight with Midnight Mass, following the
   Paschal Vigil. Then it's home and everyone nibbles on sweets for a
   while, before sleepily wishing one another Blessed Easter -- and
   toddling off to bed. There'll be grandchildren coming over for dinner
   and we need to get our rest to keep up with them...
   And just in case I don't get back on the computer to say it:

      We all wish everyone a happy and fruitful Holy Week and a Blessed
                                   Easter!

                    * Here's our recipe for Soft Pretzels

                 (makes 12 -- but we double it -- at least)

   (Go here for the fascinating history of the pretzel and its connection
                                to Holy Week)

                   1 (.25 ounces) package active dry yeast

                          2 Tablespoons brown sugar

                            1 1/8 teaspoons salt

                            1 1/2 cups warm water

                          3 cups all-purpose flour

                              1 cup bread flour

                              2 cups warm water

       1 Tablespoons baking soda dissolved in 6 qt. water in large pot

                           egg + water for eggwash

                        2 Tablespoons butter, melted

              2 Tablespoons coarse pretzel salt or kosher salt

    In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast, brown sugar and salt in 1
      1/2 cups warm water. Stir in flour, and knead dough on a floured
    surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place in a greased
    bowl, and turn to coat the surface. Cover, and let rise for one hour.
   Meanwhile, place parchment on cookie sheets and oil paper. After dough
     has risen, cut into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a 2 to 3 foot,
   finger-thick rope. With the rope, make a U, cross the ends, twist, and
          attach to the center of the bottom of the U. Place on the
      parchment-lined sheets and let rise, uncovered, 15 to 20 minutes.

    While they are rising, bring the baking soda + water in the pot to a
    boil. When the pretzels are risen, boil the pretzels in the water for
    about 3 minutes, turning once, til puffed a bit. Place on sheets and
   brush with eggwash.Bake at 450 degrees F for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
    golden brown. Brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with coarse salt

                                   Enjoy!

O Mary, Conceived Without Sin,

   O Mary, Conceived Without Sin,
   Pray for us who have recourse to thee!

Prayer to St Valentine

   Prayer to St Valentine
   for our children's choice of spouse
   Heavenly Father, we ask You to guide our children in the choice of
   spouse. Don't let them be carried away by false charms or be fascinated
   by mere outward glamour, but guide their minds to look beneath and
   beyond all external attractiveness for the deeper things which alone
   are worth while.
   Especially let the choice be of one who is a fervent Catholic, true in
   thought and word and deed to those ideals which are Yours, especially
   the value of their purity.
   Dear Father of us all, give Your guiding help to our children, who are
   Your children, too. We will be letting them go soon, but please don't
   ever let our children go from you. Amen
   St. Valentine, patron of romantic love, pray for us!
   The most important work that you and I will ever do will be within the
   walls of our own homes. ~ HB Lee

O, St. Joseph...

   O, St. Joseph...
   ...whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the Throne
   of God, I place in thee all my interests and desires. O, St. Joseph, do
   assist me by thy powerful intercession and obtain for me from thy
   Divine Son all spiritual blessings; so that having engaged here below
   thy Heavenly power I may offer my thanksgiving and homage to the most
   loving of Fathers. O, St. Joseph, I never weary contemplating thee and
   Jesus asleep in thy arms. I dare not approach while He reposes near thy
   heart. Press Him in my name, and kiss His fine Head for me, and ask Him
   to return the kiss when I draw my dying breath. St. Joseph, patron of
   departing souls, pray for us. Amen.

Prayer to the Little Flower

   Dear Little Flower of Lisieux, how wonderful was the short life you
   led. Though cloistered, you went far and wide through fervent prayers
   and great sufferings. You obtained from God untold helps and graces for
   his evangelists. Help all missionaries in their work and teach all of
   us to spread the true Faith in our own neighborhoods and family
   circles. Amen.

Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas

   Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas
   Student's Prayer: Grant me, I beseech Thee, most merciful God,
   prudently to study, rightly to understand, and perfectly to fulfill
   that which is pleasing to Thee, in the praise and glory of Thy Name.
   Amen.* * * * * * Prayer to Know God's Will: Grant me grace, O merciful
   God, to desire ardently all that is pleasing to Thee, to examine it
   prudently, to acknowledge it truthfully, and to accomplish it perfectly
   for the praise and glory of Thy name. Amen.

Memorare of St. Anne

   Memorare of St. Anne
   Remember, O holy mother, St. Anne, that never was it known that anyone
   who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy
   intercession was left unaided, for thou art a most merciful mother and
   aid all who are in distress. Inspired with this confidence, I take
   refuge with thee and beseech thee, by thy great perogative of being the
   mother of the Queen of Heaven and the Grandmother of the Saviour of the
   world, come to my aid with thy powerful intercession, and obtain from
   thine Immaculate Daughter this favor. In honor of the nine months
   during which thou didst bear the ever-blessed Virgin in thy womb and
   brought her forth without stain of original sin, I now pray nine Hail
   Marys, which I offer thee through my Guardian Angel. Amen.
