   Grasslands’ content team is stacked with experienced journalists, and
   they have a way of breaking down the complex science that defined and
   differentiated our brand and translating it so that non-PhDs could
   understand what we were doing—and its implications on an emerging
   market. The only reason we’re no longer with Grasslands is because we
   were acquired by Canopy Growth in late-2018—in part because of the
   elevated international profile Grasslands helped us attain via
   high-level public relations and thought leadership work.
   Jon CooperCEO, ebbu

   Given my own background in journalism, I have high content standards,
   yet Grasslands superseded my expectations of what pro bono service
   might offer. They are sharp, thorough, and above all, humble.
   Regardless of our status, they showed us the utmost respect. No pride,
   no ego. Just smart, turnkey content delivered with care. I am
   completely and utterly humbled by the sincerity and dedication
   Grasslands demonstrated to storytelling, to the craft of journalism, to
   the neighborhood, to the arts, and of course, to the people—not to
   mention impeccable content to boot. Grasslands, we are forever yours.

   Any veteran of the cannabis and hemp industries knows how campy and
   tired cannabis parties can be. But working with the Grasslands team
   gave my colleagues and I the opportunity to breathe new life into
   industry events that we were proud to put our name on. Grasslands'
   approach is creative, forward-thinking and inclusive, and the
   thoughtfully curated guest lists are always stacked with the names and
   faces you hope to see. Now, not only do we never miss a Grasslands
   Party, we never miss a chance to sponsor one.

   The Grasslands Party sponsorship got Manna's name attached to several
   high-level networking events across the country—at SXSW and MJBizCon,
   in New Orleans and Oakland—where we collaborated creatively on how to
   best activate the Manna brand. We all had a wonderful time, and the
   parties provided a casual and interactive environment to showcase our
   identity to packed rooms of people from all walks of life. It was a
   good time to relax, have talks with industry executives, reporters, and
   cannabis consumers, and for them in turn to get to know the faces and
   names of Manna.

   Grasslands consistently gets the job done on deadline, unquestionably,
   but more importantly: everything Grasslands does on our brand's behalf
   is informed by a communications strategy that we've developed
   collaboratively. As Coda Signature expands into California and other
   markets, we know our brand needs to be more visible in national
   publications as well as strategic local outlets—and so we engaged
   Grasslands to help us connect with highly specific demographics that
   will include our future customers, partners and investors. And
   Grasslands implements our strategy daily with accountability and
   follow-through. When we ask them to handle something, we don't have to
   ask them again. We know it's taken care of. And that accountability is
   everything when working with an agency partner.
   Mark GrindelandCEO & Co-Founder, Coda Signature

   Strategy. That's what I value most about our public relations work with
   Grasslands. With every decision, big and small, Grasslands encourages
   my colleagues and I to think long-term about our capital management
   group's primary business objectives—and how our PR program can help us
   achieve those goals. I've been especially impressed with Grasslands'
   ability to understand and roll with our sometimes-evolving priorities
   and create custom-tailored proactive pitches to the media outlets we
   need the most at that moment. And so a Denver Business Journal feature
   dedicated to CCMG was a huge win for us as we were looking to establish
   ourselves with Colorado investors, while our extensive coverage in
   Forbes, The Street and MarketWatch have been more meaningful as we
   connect with national and international investors and partners.

   Ricardo Baca and his team at Grasslands are some of the best in the
   communications biz. Through Grasslands' large network of industry
   professionals, they have connected CannAmerica Brands with like-minded
   executives and industry-leading companies, helping us secure meaningful
   connections and long-term working relationships. When working in a
   space that evolves so quickly, it’s always helpful to have
   well-connected industry professionals to help your business grow.
   Frank Falconer COO & Director, CannAmerica Brands

   We've worked with Grasslands to develop and implement our thought
   leadership strategy for more than a year, and in that time we've had
   columns written by NCIA staffers on a wide range of issues publish in a
   number of local, national and international outlets, including
   International Business Times, TechCrunch, Green Entrepreneur and
   others. Thought leadership is an essential part of NCIA's
   communications strategy, and Grasslands is a valuable partner helping
   us promote the responsible cannabis industry.
   Morgan Fox Media Relations Director, National Cannabis Industry
   Association

   While many PR teams create a client strategy and barrel forward in that
   direction no matter what, I'm thankful Grasslands knows that a
   successful PR program is one that evolves and changes course with the
   ebb and flow of a client's business and its priorities. Our business is
   a complex organization, with coast-to-coast licensing agreements,
   public company listings in multiple countries and exciting LOIs in the
   U.S., Latin America, Europe and beyond; Grasslands has not only
   executed our most essential needs of the moment, they have also become
   our trusted advisers as we discuss long-term corporate planning for
   public relations, marketing, communications and events.
   Dan Anglin CEO & Co-founder, CannAmerica Brands

   I couldn't believe my eyes, seeing my byline and my words in a print
   issue of Entrepreneur magazine, a decades-old international publication
   read by so many of my mentors, peers and competitors—and potential
   customers, as it turns out. A few days after the issue first hit
   newsstands, my inbox was flooded with biz dev opportunities—other
   entrepreneurs who appreciated what I'd written and connected with my
   perspective and wanted to discuss bringing my security company on as
   their security provider. A few days later, I'd inked my first deal
   based on the thought leadership column: It was a CEO who knew he wanted
   to work with me after reading my column. And that was the first of
   multiple doors that opened thanks to Grasslands' strategic and
   relentless thought leadership work on my behalf.
   Hunter GarthManaging Director, Iron Protection Group
   Hunter Garth
   When we realized we needed an external perspective on branding and
   operations, we knew we needed an experienced team with unquestionable
   industry expertise and a strategy-forward approach that would help us
   stand out in a crowded market—and we were lucky to partner with the
   team at Grasslands. With Grasslands' help, we created and implemented a
   creative-but-relatable brand name, an education-forward retail
   experience, a thoughtfully curated inventory, a sales-savvy showroom
   and a memorable customer experience. And as our business continues to
   grow, we hope to engage Grasslands for public relations and other
   marketing services.
   Roger Newton Director, Plantlife Canada

   For years, journalists and the cannabis industry alike have looked to
   Ricardo Baca for insights and perspective. Ricardo knows the consumer
   and the cannabis business with unparalleled depth and breadth.
   Roy BinghamCEO & Co-Founder, BDS Analytics
   Roy Bingham
   Ricardo’s integrity and background as a highly respected journalist
   made bringing him onto the team an easy decision. We are lucky to have
   someone with his level of thoughtfulness, commitment and character
   working with us side-by-side on our mission to improve the quality of
   life of conscientious cannabis consumers everywhere.
   Michael RayCEO, Bloom Farms

   As my colleagues and I were conducting groundbreaking scientific
   research at ebbu’s laboratory in Colorado, we needed an agency partner
   to open some strategic doors for us so that we could tell the world
   about everything we were doing—and Grasslands opened those doors and
   had our backs with each opportunity. From speaking engagements
   throughout the U.S. and Canada to brand features in Rolling Stone and
   USA Today, Grasslands leveraged its extensive relationships in
   international media and conferences so that I could tell ebbu’s story
   where it mattered most.
   Jon CooperCEO, ebbu
   Jon Cooper
   To say Grasslands is generous is an understatement. I am beyond
   grateful for the dedication to community, flawless content, and utter
   humility. Through its pro bono content marketing and social media
   management, Grasslands truly transformed our all-volunteer
   organization, providing the strong marketing and communications
   foundation we strove for but did not have the staff to achieve. Thanks
   to their services, we raised the bar and nearly doubled our social
   media following. But more importantly, through Ricardo Baca’s and his
   team’s efforts, we were able to provide quality, agency-produced
   content for local working artists and small businesses in Denver. The
   Grasslands team authentically told their stories and promoted their
   work, helping to preserve art and culture in this corner of the city
   that is integral to the fabric of Denver and its history. And we’re
   grateful.
   Amy DvorakPast President, Denver’s Art District on Santa Fe
   Amy Dvorak
   When we first engaged Grasslands to produce an elevated event for
   Mary’s Medicinals, we knew it had to transcend event status—that it
   needed to feel like a memorable, experiential happening. And even on a
   modest budget, the Grasslands team had a never-ending list of fun,
   creative and unexpected ideas to create special touch-points for
   attendees. Grasslands communicated clearly and efficiently throughout
   the planning process, and once the doors opened to our special guests
   it became clear to me that every single detail of the event exuded
   Mary's in the most meaningful way. And it wasn't just an event—it was
   an experience, which is exactly what we wanted. We were thankful to
   work with an event production partner who listened to our ideas and
   translated our vision into such a remarkably on-brand experience.
   Elle WelchMarketing & Communications Manager, Mary's Brands
   Elle Welch
   Building a meaningful brand story and supporting it with consistent
   messaging and PR strategies may be a more intricate endeavor in modern
   cannabis and hemp than nearly any other industry. Willie’s Reserve and
   Willie’s Remedy are both inspired by Willie Nelson, so shaping distinct
   roles and communications for our related-but-different brands requires
   an in-depth understanding of the benefits of the plant, and an
   appreciation for the constraints of the marketplace. Grasslands has
   been an invaluable partner on that complicated front. Grasslands is the
   rare public relations agency that strategically educates and informs as
   it gets the word out.
