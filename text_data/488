Sociomantic Technology privacy notice

   This privacy notice is to inform you about the functioning and
   processing of personal data when using our display advertising
   technology, Sociomantic tags and Sociomantic cookies. Sociomantic
   Technology is integrated into websites to enable targeted
   displayadvertising. The providers of the respective websites are
   responsible for the integration. Please also note their individual
   privacy policies.

   You can print or store this privacy notice by using the standard
   functions of your browser. You can also download and archive a PDF file
   of this privacy notice by clicking here (PDF).

I. Provider of Sociomantic Technology

   Sociomantic Technology is provided by dunnhumby Germany GmbH,
   Paul-Lincke-Ufer 39/40, 10999 Berlin (“Sociomantic”). Should you have
   any questions regarding data protection in connection with Sociomantic
   Technology, you can contact Sociomantic’s data protection officer at
   any time: The data protection officer can be contacted by emailing
   individualrights@dunnhumby.com or by writing to the postal address
   provided (please mark all correspondence with: “FAO Sociomantic data
   protection officer”).

II. Data processing in connection with Sociomantic Technology

   1. Principle of pseudonymous processing. Personal data means any
   information that can be attributed to a person, such as name, age,
   email address, telephone number or information about the use of
   websites. In principle, Sociomantic tags and Sociomantic cookies do not
   involve the recording of any information about users in clear text.
   Sociomantic process neither the names nor the addresses or email
   addresses of users. Instead, all information about the user interaction
   with the websites is recorded, stored and evaluated using temporary
   identifiers which Sociomantic is unable to decode (so-called
   pseudonyms).

   2. Purpose of the use of Sociomantic Technology. In principle, the
   advertisers who implement Sociomantic Technology are responsible for
   the associated data processing. Sociomantic processes the data on
   behalf of the advertisers, so that they can address their customers by
   means of tailored display advertising and what are known as targeting
   campaigns on different devices or attract other users who may be
   interested in their products, offers and content. When serving display
   advertising, this gives advertisers the opportunity to targetusers who
   are actually interested in their products, offers and content. At the
   same time, if website operators integrate advertising to help fund
   their websites, targeted display advertising helps them to achieve
   higher prices for ad space. In the best case, this also causes the use
   of advertising to become less extensive, less bothersome and more
   interesting. For advertisers, targeted ads mean lower costs.

   While the advertising customers are in principle responsible themselves
   for data processing when using Sociomantic Technology, in certain
   regards Sociomantic also processes data for its own purposes. In order
   to be able to bill advertisers for campaigns booked by them, to check
   invoices of our partners and to improve Sociomantic Technology,
   Sociomantic uses a Sociomantic identifier to process data, which makes
   it possible to recognise users and serve interest-based ads on
   different devices, although this does not make it possible for
   Sociomantic to identify the individual user. If advertising has been
   served, Sociomantic stores information about the successful ad serving
   for the respective Sociomantic identifier. At the same time, this
   allows to monitor the number of impressions in order to detect, correct
   and prevent technical errors and conspicuous constellations and to
   improve Sociomantic’s products and optimise serving of ads based on
   insights from previous impressions.

   Categories of data processed and how Sociomantic tags work. The display
   advertising is implemented using cookies and comparable technologies.
   Displaying the corresponding interest-based ads is made possible by
   Sociomantic first recording the interaction on the customer’s website
   (e.g. the pages of an online shop) and evaluating which content is
   relevant to the user. This involves collecting the following data:
   (sub)pages visited (e.g. about products or product categories); date
   and time of access; unique mobile device identifiers (e.g. advertising
   ID); and technical information about the browser and operating system
   used. The IP addresses are used to roughly determine the region or
   postal code area in which the device (from which the website with the
   ad space offered was retrieved) is located. This location determination
   ensures in particular that ads are only served for products and
   services that are in principle available at the respective location. In
   the campaigns, Sociomantic’s customers can specify in which regions the
   respective advertising should be served. Furthermore, a Sociomantic
   customer can also provide further information about its own users, on
   the basis of which it can make its own selections for corresponding
   interest-based ads. For example, when displaying interest-based ads
   this makes it possible to consider the fact that users have indicated
   that they are more interested or not interested in certain product
   categories.

   All information collected about the user interaction with the
   customer’s website or the customer’s further information about its
   users is stored exclusively using an identifier that cannot be decoded
   by Sociomantic. No names, contact details, addresses or sensitive
   information whatsoever are stored using this identifier. Sociomantic’s
   customer then decides in an advertising campaign which advertising
   content (e.g. banners) should ideally be served to users who have
   previously visited certain content (e.g. products and product
   categories) on the customer’s website. If a user subsequently visits
   another website, e.g. a news website (a publisher), on which free ad
   space is available, the previously recorded information about the user
   interaction with the customer’s website is used to recognise the user
   and serve targeted advertising to them.

   Technically, when the website is accessed, the publisher makes a
   request on a specially created platform, via which ad space is
   auctioned. Sociomantic constantly receives requests to bid on ad space
   available on the platform. If available ad space and the page on which
   it is located match an advertising campaign of a customer of
   Sociomantic, the ad space is acquired within a fraction of a second and
   the ad shown to the user. If the user clicks on the ad served, this is
   recorded by Sociomantic. Sociomantic does not know the identity of
   users; by means of Sociomantic Technology, Sociomantic can only
   recognise users who have previously visited a customer’s website.

   3. Data recipients. Data collected by Sociomantic is only disclosed to
   third parties if this is necessary for the implementation of campaigns
   or other purposes listed in this privacy notice, or if another legal
   basis for the disclosure of data exists. The collection and
   transmission of data by the websites on which the auctioned ad space is
   available – ad space which may then be filled with interest-based ads
   using Sociomantic Technology – are controlled by and the exclusive
   responsibility of the providers of those websites. The providers of the
   websites also integrate the special platforms via which ad space is
   auctioned. In the context of the adserving, data is exchanged between
   Sociomantic and these special platforms. Sociomantic informs the
   platforms which specific ads should be served to which users. This
   involves comparing Sociomantic identifiers and unique mobile device
   identifiers (e.g. advertising ID) with the publishers’ identifiers and
   geolocation using IP addresses

   If Sociomantic uses its own external service providers (e.g. data
   centres), the service providers may only use the data to fulfil their
   task. All service providers have been carefully selected and
   commissioned. They are bound by the instructions of Sociomantic and are
   regularly checked. In cases where data is processed in countries
   outside the European Union, appropriate safeguards are always in place
   to protect data subjects.

   4. Storage period. The data collected about the retrieval of a
   customer’s website and associated with a Sociomantic ID will remain in
   the Sociomantic database for a maximum of 90 days the data will be
   completely anonymised., and the user profile recorded under the
   Sociomantic ID is deleted after 60 days after the last visit to a
   website on which Sociomantic Technology is used.

   5. Legal basis. The data processing described above serves to implement
   targeted display advertising campaigns for Sociomantic’s customers.
   Where Sociomantic collects data on customers’ websites and processes it
   for the deployment of campaigns, this is done on behalf of the customer
   and at all times in line with Agreements and the Customer’s written
   instructions. Where data is also collected for the purposes of billing,
   error correction and optimisation of Sociomantic products, this occurs
   on the basis of these legitimate interests. The legal basis for the
   storage of the tracking data using the Sociomantic identifier is
   pursuant toArt. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR)

III. Your rights

   You have the right to information about the processing of your personal
   data by Sociomantic. In this regard, Sociomantic will explain the data
   processing to you and provide you with an overview of the data stored
   about you. If data stored by Sociomantic is incorrect or no longer up
   to date, you have the right to have this data corrected. You may also
   demand that your data be erased. Should the erasure not be possible in
   exceptional cases due to other legal regulations, the data will be
   blocked so that it is only available for that legal purpose. You may
   also have the processing of your personal data restricted, if for
   example you have doubts as to the accuracy of the data. You also have
   the right to data portability, which means that on request Sociomantic
   will send you a digital copy of the personal data you have provided.
   You also have the right to object to data processing, insofar as this
   is based on legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6(1) Sentence 1
   (f) GDPR. In particular, you can object to the processing of your data
   for advertising purposes at any time. The opt-out function described
   below can be used for this purpose at any time. You also have the right
   to complain to the data protection supervisory authority responsible
   for Sociomantic (Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of
   Information, Friedrichstr. 219, 10969 Berlin) or to your competent
   authority. You are also free to contact your local data protection
   authority, which will then forward your request to the competent
   authority.
   Sociomantic opt-out/possibility to object. If you no longer wish to be
   shown personalized ads, please use the following link: Disable
   Sociomantic Technology. This will place a new cookie in your browser.
   This cookie ensures that on this device and in this browser no data
   about your interaction with websites where the Sociomantic Technology
   is implemented is collected via the Sociomantic tags and,  that
   Sociomantic will no longer serve targeted display advertising to you.
   Please note that configuring your browser to erase, restrict or block
   cookies, but also using a different browser or device, may mean that
   you need to perform this opt-out again. This opt-out only applies to
   ads served by Sociomantic, and not to ads served by other providers.

   For mobile devices, please use one of the following opt-out options:

   In your device’s system settings, you have the option of stopping data
   from being collected for purposes of personalised advertising on that
   device.

   iOS: In the system settings, go to “Privacy” and then tap on
   “Advertising”. Turn on “Limit Ad Tracking”.

   Android: In the settings menu, go to “Google” (in the “Users” area) and
   then “Ads”. Turn on “Opt out of interest-based ads”.

IV. Transparency and self-regulation

1. Identification. All ads servedby Sociomantic are marked as such and
