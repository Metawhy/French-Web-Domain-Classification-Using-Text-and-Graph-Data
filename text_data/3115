   I really enjoyed these two weeks in the Alpadia Camp. I met a lot of
   new people and I could speak to them in English and I improved it very
   much. I also liked the the lessons and my teacher was very nice and the
   activities were very interesting. I really liked the sports and the
   excursions. Thank you!
