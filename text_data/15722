Why AutoHotkey

   AutoHotkey gives you the freedom to automate any desktop task. It's

A peek at the syntax...

   AutoHotkey provides a simple, flexible syntax allowing you to focus
   more on the task at hand rather than every single little technicality.
   It supports not only the popular imperative-procedural paradigm, but
   also object-oriented and command-based programming.

   Here are a few simple examples:
    1. Hotstrings & Hotkeys
    2. Clipboard example
    3. Short GUI
    4. Simple Array (or Objects)

macros, and offers a scripting language which is more powerful than any batch
file.

With AutoHotkey, I’m confident that I’ve trimmed the time I spend replying to
emails down to a third of what it would be without.
