A Boy From Ohio

   Before LEWIS HOWES became a media sensation for empowering people and
   sharing 'Greatness' across the globe, he had his share of obstacles to
   overcome. From having a learning disability, which led to being alone
   and bullied in school, to being sexually abused as a child, to being
   injured and broke on his sister’s couch, Lewis’s story is the perfect
   example of how anybody can overcome the obstacles in their life and
   achieve greatness. Fast forward a few short years, and Lewis is a New
   York Times Bestselling author of the hit book, The School of Greatness
   and author of his latest book, The Mask of Masculinity. He is a
   lifestyle entrepreneur, high performance business coach and keynote
   speaker. A former professional football player and two-sport
   All-American, he is a current USA Men’s National Handball Team athlete.
   He hosts a top 100 podcast in the world, The School of Greatness, which
   has over 40 million downloads since it launched in 2013. He was
   recognized by The White House and President Obama as one of the top 100
   entrepreneurs in the country under 30. Lewis has been featured on
   Ellen, The New York Times, People, Forbes, Inc, Fast Company, ESPN,
   Sports Illustrated, Men’s Health, The Today Show and other major media
   outlets.
