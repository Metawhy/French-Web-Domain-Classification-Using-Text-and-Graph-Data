   This is how I looked like some years ago.

Institutes

   My research activities are conducted in the ACADIE team from the
   Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT), UMR 5505 from
   the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). I am part time
   member of the INGEQUIP team from Institut de Recherche Technologique
   (IRT) Saint Exupery.

   I am associate professor at Ecole Nationale Supérieure
   d'Electrotechnique, Electronique, Informatique, Hydraulique et des
   Télécommunications (ENSEEIHT), a public engineering school part of
   Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse (INPT), which is a member
   of the Pôle de Recherche et Enseignement Supérieur (PRES) Université de
   Toulouse.
