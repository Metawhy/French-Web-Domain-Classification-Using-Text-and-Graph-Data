   "Absolutely loved the experience, the food, and our guide, Ellis, was
   just wonderful—she is so knowledgeable, friendly and fun! We walked and
   laughed and ate for a good three hours; such a great way to start the
   day. We explored a few iconic neighbourhoods of Lisbon, and Ellis
   provided us with very interesting details about it all (think
   insightful, juicy stories about the people and places we saw)."
