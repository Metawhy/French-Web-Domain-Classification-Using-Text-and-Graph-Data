Seasons of Change...

   I've always loved the change of the seasons. Spring popping with new
   fresh color after a long cold winter where color seems to take a
   vacation, summer exploding with even more vibrant and bold colors as
   the birds and flowers grow and mature. Then the warm colors of fall as
   the summer comes to a close and everything begins to prepare for the
   winter again. And so goes the cycle... As for me personally the seasons
   of my life are changing too! I find that I can't keep the pace with the
   schedule I set for myself in the past. Not necessarily a bad
   thing...but definately a change. Speaking of change, I'm about to make
   a big change in where I live and paint. My husband and I are moving
   back to Texas to be closer to our family. We have lived in the Great
   Northwest for almost fifteen years and have grown fond of the
   landscape, the people and the climate. Yes, it will be like going home.
   I will continue to paint and share my love for watercolor with more DVD
   workshops. Hopefully the transition will help me find the time to
   devote to the DVDs without being distracted. Time will tell. I want to
   thank all the wonderful students and artists friends I have met up here
   for letting me be a part of your artistic journey. We must keep in
   touch! I hope you will feel free to comment and share your successes
   with me too! Please watch this blog and my facebook pages for updates
   on what I'm up to. And remember to keep those brushes wet! Susie

April is Tulip Time!

   Spring is just around the corner...can't you feel it? I'm so ready!!!!
   Today the sun is shinning and the birds are happy and chirping outside.
   Of course the weather forecasters say rain is only a couple of days
   away BUT today there is sunshine!
   [montageoftulipfields.jpg] The tulips in the Skagit Valley of the Great
   Northwest are said to be on time this year. Yippee!! The daffodils are
   blooming now and it won't be long before the early tulips fill the
   fields with color too. When you look out across a field of glorious
   color you can't help but want to get a paintbrush in hand and have a go
   at splashing on some paint. And I have a fun way to paint those
   colorful rows of tulips.
   At the First Tuesday Watercolor class in Seattle and the Second
   Wednesday Watercolor class in Bellevue my students and I will be
   painting tulip fields similar to these examples I'm sharing here. If
   you are in the area and interested in joining us there are still a few
   seats available. Call me! Or visit my website for more information and
   to register online or by snail mail. Class is from 11-4 @ the Daniel
   Smith Store Classrooms in Seattle and Bellevue.
   ALSO...If you are interested taking a day trip to sketch and photograph
   the tulips fields later this month give me a call or shoot me an email
   and I'll let you know when I'm going and would love to plan a
   rendezvous.
   Keep those brushes wet!
