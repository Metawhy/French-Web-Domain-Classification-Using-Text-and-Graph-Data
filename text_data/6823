Navitas: World’s First GaN Power ICs Leave Silicon Behind

   AllGaN™ monolithic integration of GaN power FETs with drive and logic
   enables 10x-100x higher frequency to set new benchmarks in power
   density, energy efficiency and system cost
   March 16, 2016 07:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Navitas Semiconductor today
   announced the world’s first Gallium Nitride (GaN) Power ICs, using its
   proprietary AllGaN™ monolithically-integrated 650V platform. Combining
   GaN power FETs with GaN logic and drive circuits enables 10x-100x
   higher switching frequency than existing silicon circuits, making power
   electronics smaller, lighter and lower cost. A new generation of high
   frequency, energy efficient converters is being enabled for smartphone
   and laptop chargers, OLED TVs, LED lighting, solar inverters, wireless
   charging devices and datacenters.

   “GaN has tremendous potential to displace silicon in the power
   electronics market given its inherent high-speed, high-efficiency
   capabilities as a power FET,” says Dan Kinzer, Navitas CTO & COO.
   “Previously, that potential was limited by the lack of equally high
   performance circuits to drive the GaN FETs quickly and cost
   effectively. Navitas has solved this remaining challenge to unlock the
   full potential of the power GaN market. With monolithic integration of
   GaN drive and logic circuits with GaN power FETs, the industry now has
   a path to cost-effective, easy-to-use, high-frequency power system
   designs.”

   CEO Gene Sheridan added, “The last time power electronics experienced a
   dramatic improvement in density, efficiency and cost was in the late
   70s when silicon MOSFETs replaced bipolar transistors, enabling a
   transition from linear regulators to switching regulators. A 10x
   improvement in density, 3x reduction in power losses and 3x lower cost
   resulted a short time thereafter. A similar market disruption is about
   to occur in which GaN power ICs will enable low-frequency,
   silicon-based power systems to be replaced by high-frequency GaN with
   dramatic improvements in density, efficiency and cost. This is an
   exciting time for the industry.”

   Navitas will introduce the AllGaN platform and GaN Power ICs in a
   keynote titled “Breaking Speed Limits with GaN Power ICs” at the
   Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC) on Monday 21^st March.

Strategy Analytics: Apple Watch Captures Half of 18 Million Global Smartwatch
Shipments in Q4 2018

   February 27, 2019 09:09 PM Eastern Standard Time

   BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to the latest research from Strategy
   Analytics, global smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent
   annually to reach a record 18 million units in the fourth quarter of
   2018. Apple Watch maintained first position with 51 percent global
   smartwatch marketshare, while Samsung jumped to second place,
   overtaking Fitbit and Garmin.

   Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global
   smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent annually from 11.6
   million units in Q4 2017 to a record 18.2 million in Q4 2018. Global
   smartwatch shipments hit an all-time high of 45.0 million units in
   full-year 2018. Smartwatch growth is soaring, as consumers seek to
   accessorize their smartphones and bring digital connectivity to their
   wrists.”

   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Apple
   shipped 9.2 million smartwatches worldwide in Q4 2018, rising 18
   percent from 7.8 million units in Q4 2017. Apple’s global smartwatch
   marketshare slipped to 51 percent this quarter, down from 67 percent a
   year ago. Apple Watch is losing marketshare to Samsung and Fitbit,
   whose rival smartwatch portfolios and retail presence have improved
   significantly in the past year.”

   shipped 2.4 million smartwatches worldwide and captured 13 percent
   global smartwatch marketshare in Q4 2018, rising strongly from 5
   percent marketshare a year ago. Samsung is once again the world’s
   second largest smartwatch brand. Its new Galaxy Watch proved popular in
   North America and Asia. Samsung has a good pipeline of new models for
   2019, such as the innovative Galaxy Watch Active with blood-pressure
   tracking, and Samsung should perform well this year.”

   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Fitbit
   captured 13 percent global smartwatch marketshare in Q4 2018, tripling
   from 4 percent in Q4 2017. Fitbit is becoming established as a top-tier
   smartwatch brand. Fitbit is very popular in the United States market.
   Fitbit’s Versa smartwatches are gaining mass-appeal and its new Fitbit
   Care connected health platform is a useful differentiator for the
   brand. Garmin held fourth position and captured 6 percent worldwide
   smartwatch marketshare during Q4 2018, holding steady from 6 percent a
   year ago. Rising competition from Fitbit, Samsung and others in the
   sports and music categories is making it harder for Garmin to make
   headway in smartwatches. Combined together, Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and
   Garmin are the big four players, accounting for 8 in 10 of all
   smartwatches shipped worldwide.”

Navitas: World’s First GaN Power ICs Leave Silicon Behind

   AllGaN™ monolithic integration of GaN power FETs with drive and logic
   enables 10x-100x higher frequency to set new benchmarks in power
   density, energy efficiency and system cost
   March 16, 2016 07:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Navitas Semiconductor today
   announced the world’s first Gallium Nitride (GaN) Power ICs, using its
   proprietary AllGaN™ monolithically-integrated 650V platform. Combining
   GaN power FETs with GaN logic and drive circuits enables 10x-100x
   higher switching frequency than existing silicon circuits, making power
   electronics smaller, lighter and lower cost. A new generation of high
   frequency, energy efficient converters is being enabled for smartphone
   and laptop chargers, OLED TVs, LED lighting, solar inverters, wireless
   charging devices and datacenters.

   “GaN has tremendous potential to displace silicon in the power
   electronics market given its inherent high-speed, high-efficiency
   capabilities as a power FET,” says Dan Kinzer, Navitas CTO & COO.
   “Previously, that potential was limited by the lack of equally high
   performance circuits to drive the GaN FETs quickly and cost
   effectively. Navitas has solved this remaining challenge to unlock the
   full potential of the power GaN market. With monolithic integration of
   GaN drive and logic circuits with GaN power FETs, the industry now has
   a path to cost-effective, easy-to-use, high-frequency power system
   designs.”

   CEO Gene Sheridan added, “The last time power electronics experienced a
   dramatic improvement in density, efficiency and cost was in the late
   70s when silicon MOSFETs replaced bipolar transistors, enabling a
   transition from linear regulators to switching regulators. A 10x
   improvement in density, 3x reduction in power losses and 3x lower cost
   resulted a short time thereafter. A similar market disruption is about
   to occur in which GaN power ICs will enable low-frequency,
   silicon-based power systems to be replaced by high-frequency GaN with
   dramatic improvements in density, efficiency and cost. This is an
   exciting time for the industry.”

   Navitas will introduce the AllGaN platform and GaN Power ICs in a
   keynote titled “Breaking Speed Limits with GaN Power ICs” at the
   Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC) on Monday 21^st March.

   About Navitas:

   Navitas Semiconductor Inc. is the world’s first and only GaN Power IC
   company, founded in El Segundo, CA, USA in 2013. Navitas has a strong

Strategy Analytics: Apple Watch Captures Half of 18 Million Global Smartwatch
Shipments in Q4 2018

   February 27, 2019 09:09 PM Eastern Standard Time

   BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to the latest research from Strategy
   Analytics, global smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent
   annually to reach a record 18 million units in the fourth quarter of
   2018. Apple Watch maintained first position with 51 percent global
   smartwatch marketshare, while Samsung jumped to second place,
   overtaking Fitbit and Garmin.

   Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global
   smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent annually from 11.6
   million units in Q4 2017 to a record 18.2 million in Q4 2018. Global
   smartwatch shipments hit an all-time high of 45.0 million units in
   full-year 2018. Smartwatch growth is soaring, as consumers seek to
   accessorize their smartphones and bring digital connectivity to their
   wrists.”

   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Apple
   shipped 9.2 million smartwatches worldwide in Q4 2018, rising 18
   percent from 7.8 million units in Q4 2017. Apple’s global smartwatch
   marketshare slipped to 51 percent this quarter, down from 67 percent a
   year ago. Apple Watch is losing marketshare to Samsung and Fitbit,
   whose rival smartwatch portfolios and retail presence have improved

   the world.”

   SD Express keeps pace with growing performance levels of mobile and
   client computing, imaging and automotive as they adopt faster
   communication and embedded storage protocols designed to make
   processing data faster.

   “With SD Express we’re offering an entirely new level of memory card
   with faster protocols turning cards into a removable SSD,” said
   Hiroyuki Sakamoto, SDA president. “SD 7.0 delivers revolutionary
   innovations to anticipate the needs of forthcoming devices and content
   rich and speed hungry applications.”

   “PCI-SIG is pleased to have teamed with the SDA to collaborate on this
   innovation for the world’s leading removable memory card – SD,” said Al

Ziff Davis Acquires Toolbox.com

   January 03, 2012 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time

   NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ziff Davis, Inc., one of the nation’s
   leading technology media companies, today announced the acquisition of
   Toolbox.com, the #1 professional networking site for IT professionals,
   from the Corporate Executive Board.

   Founded in 1998 and based in Scottsdale, AZ, Toolbox.com supports
   decision-making throughout the IT life cycle by linking over three
   million IT experts and executives across the globe each month.
   Toolbox.com enables users to evaluate vendors, plan and manage
   projects, solve problems and stay current.

   Effective immediately, Toolbox.com will be a unit of Ziff Davis B2B
   Focus, which was formed earlier this year with Ziff Davis’ acquisition
   of Focus Research, Inc., a leading provider of online research to
   enterprise buyers and high-quality leads to IT vendors.

   The fourth acquisition for Ziff Davis in the past year, Toolbox.com
   gives the fast growing digital media company a professional networking
   site with 2.3 million registered members who ask and answer thousands
   of IT questions each month. The media and lead gen offerings of Toolbox
   will strengthen Ziff Davis B2B Focus’ suite of offerings to IT
   marketers.

   “We’ve added a critical piece to our puzzle with the acquisition of
   Toolbox.com,” said Vivek Shah, CEO of Ziff Davis. “The IT community
   relies on itself to make decisions and be informed. Owning the leading
   professional networking site is a significant strategic advantage for
   Ziff Davis.”

   The Corporate Executive Board was represented by DeSilva + Phillips, a
   New York-based investment bank specializing in media, marketing and
   information companies, in its divestiture of Toolbox.com.

   technology market, reaching over 40 million highly engaged in-market

   February 14, 2019 12:00 AM Eastern Standard Time

   NAIROBI, Kenya--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Western Union Company, a leader in
   cross-border, cross-currency money movement, today unveiled a new
   payment option that allows Amazon.com customers in Kenya to pay in
   local currency for their Amazon.com purchases. The service is being
   offered initially in 10 countries – Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong,
   Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand –
   enabling customers who prefer to pay in cash to shop Amazon.com’s vast
   product selection.

   Western Union’s platform is powering Amazon’s new cross-border payment
   option, called Amazon PayCode, by processing the complex foreign
   exchange, settlement and money movement requirements for international
   e-commerce transactions.

   After selecting PayCode on the Amazon.com checkout page, customers will
   be sent a code, along with instructions on how to pay in person at a
   participating Western Union® agent location. The move by Western Union
   and Amazon will provide greater access to online goods for customers
   who have largely been excluded from e-commerce shopping due to lack of
   accepted payment methods.

   Expanding Customer Access and Closing the Payments Gap

   Forrester Research estimates that cross-border shopping will represent
   20% of e-commerce by 2022, with sales reaching $630 billion.^1 Choice,
   quality and cost are the main motivations for customers to shop online
   from overseas, but there are challenges and concerns about the lack of
   payment options for those who prefer to pay in person or those who do
   not have access to international credit cards or debit cards.

   “We’re helping to unlock access to Amazon.com for customers who need
   and want items that can only be found online in many parts of the
   world,” said Khalid Fellahi, SVP and General Manager of Western Union
   Digital. “This is a great example of two global brands innovating and
   collaborating to bring customers more convenience and choice. In a
   world where cross-border buyers and sellers are often located on
   different continents and in completely different financial ecosystems,
   our platform is ideally suited to solving the complexity of collecting
   local currency and converting it into whatever currency merchants need
   on the other end.”

   “Amazon is committed to enabling customers anywhere in the world to
   shop on Amazon.com, and a big part of that is to allow customers to pay
   for their cross-border online purchases in a way that is most
   convenient for them,” said Ben Volk, Director, Payment Acceptance and
   Experience at Amazon. “Amazon PayCode leverages the reach of Western
   Union to make cross-border online shopping a reliable and convenient
   experience for customers who do not have access to international credit
   cards, or prefer to pay in cash.”

   For more information about the new Western Union payment option,
   visit: https://www.westernunion.com/paylocal/ke/. For more information
   about Amazon PayCode visit: https://www.amazon.com/paycode.

   About Western Union’s Cross-Border Platform

   Western Union’s cross-border, cross-currency money movement platform –
   including a robust digital footprint, settlement, treasury and
   compliance infrastructure, a vast global retail network of over half a
   million locations, and the ability to send money to billions of
   accounts and mobile wallets – sets the standard for international money
   movement. With operations in more than 200 countries and territories,
   Western Union’s platform processed an average of 34 transactions every
   second and moved $300 billion in principal across 130 currencies in
   2018.

   Connecting the digital and physical worlds of money, Western Union’s
   technology stack, APIs, foreign exchange and settlement engine, agent
   network, anti-money laundering and fraud detection capabilities make it
   one of the largest digital and physical money movers for consumers
   around the globe. The company offers digital transactions in more than
   50 countries and territories. Approximately 70% of Western Union’s
   digital transactions globally now originate on mobile devices.

   About Western Union

   The Western Union Company is a global leader in cross-border,
   cross-currency money movement. Our omnichannel platform connects the
   digital and physical worlds and makes it possible for consumers and
   businesses to send and receive money and make payments with speed,
   ease, and reliability. As of December 31, 2018, our network included

   Orlandi Valuta branded services in more than 200 countries and

   available in more than 60 countries, plus additional territories, to

Navitas: World’s First GaN Power ICs Leave Silicon Behind

   AllGaN™ monolithic integration of GaN power FETs with drive and logic
   enables 10x-100x higher frequency to set new benchmarks in power
   density, energy efficiency and system cost
   March 16, 2016 07:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Navitas Semiconductor today
   announced the world’s first Gallium Nitride (GaN) Power ICs, using its
   proprietary AllGaN™ monolithically-integrated 650V platform. Combining
   GaN power FETs with GaN logic and drive circuits enables 10x-100x
   higher switching frequency than existing silicon circuits, making power
   electronics smaller, lighter and lower cost. A new generation of high
   frequency, energy efficient converters is being enabled for smartphone
   and laptop chargers, OLED TVs, LED lighting, solar inverters, wireless
   charging devices and datacenters.

   “GaN has tremendous potential to displace silicon in the power
   electronics market given its inherent high-speed, high-efficiency
   capabilities as a power FET,” says Dan Kinzer, Navitas CTO & COO.
   “Previously, that potential was limited by the lack of equally high
   performance circuits to drive the GaN FETs quickly and cost
   effectively. Navitas has solved this remaining challenge to unlock the
   full potential of the power GaN market. With monolithic integration of
   GaN drive and logic circuits with GaN power FETs, the industry now has
   a path to cost-effective, easy-to-use, high-frequency power system
   designs.”

   CEO Gene Sheridan added, “The last time power electronics experienced a
   dramatic improvement in density, efficiency and cost was in the late
   70s when silicon MOSFETs replaced bipolar transistors, enabling a
   transition from linear regulators to switching regulators. A 10x
   improvement in density, 3x reduction in power losses and 3x lower cost
   resulted a short time thereafter. A similar market disruption is about
   to occur in which GaN power ICs will enable low-frequency,
   silicon-based power systems to be replaced by high-frequency GaN with
   dramatic improvements in density, efficiency and cost. This is an
   exciting time for the industry.”

   Navitas will introduce the AllGaN platform and GaN Power ICs in a
   keynote titled “Breaking Speed Limits with GaN Power ICs” at the
   Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC) on Monday 21^st March.

   About Navitas:

   Navitas Semiconductor Inc. is the world’s first and only GaN Power IC
   company, founded in El Segundo, CA, USA in 2013. Navitas has a strong
   and growing team of power semiconductor industry experts with a

   WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--National Geographic, with Imagine
   Television Studios and Fox 21 Television Studios, announced today that
   Tony®-, Emmy®- and Grammy® Award-winning Cynthia Erivo (“Harriet,”
   Broadway’s “The Color Purple”) will star as Aretha Franklin in the next
   installment of the Emmy-winning global anthology series Genius: Aretha.
   This upcoming season will be the first-ever, definitive and only
   authorized scripted limited series on the life of the universally
   acclaimed Queen of Soul. Filming will start this November for a spring
   2020 premiere on National Geographic channels in 172 countries and 43
   languages.

   The production will feature many of Franklin’s biggest recordings and
   hit songs from the comprehensive Warner Music catalogue, including “I
   Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You),” “Chain of Fools,” “Don’t Play
   That Song,” “Since You’ve Been Gone” and “Baby I Love You.” In
   addition, the series will feature Franklin’s performances of “I Knew
   You Were Waiting for Me,” “Freeway of Love” and “Sisters Are Doin’ It
   for Themselves.” Erivo will also be performing many of the songs from
   Franklin’s rich catalogue.

   “Aretha Franklin has been a source of inspiration for me since I was a
   little girl,” said Erivo. “Her strength, passion and soul are evident
   in her everlasting legacy, not only as a transcendent artist, but as a
   humanitarian and civil rights icon. To have the opportunity to bring
   her legacy to life and show the fullness of her being, her humanity and
   brilliance, is an honor. What I know and have learned about what my
   voice, as an artist, can do and the power in it has been highly
   influenced by Franklin. I feel privileged and excited to be a part of
   the sharing of her genius.”

   “Cynthia Erivo blew me away. Not only is she an incredible and bona
   fide star, but she is soulful and has tremendous depth as a musical
   artist,” said Brian Grazer. “Cynthia is the perfect person to portray
   the profoundly human story behind the genius that is Aretha.”

   Ms. Franklin’s niece Sabrina Owens said, “For GENIUS to honor Aretha is
   a great affirmation of her legacy, and Cynthia Erivo is an
   extraordinary talent with an amazing voice!”

   “The fabulously talented Cynthia Erivo is dream casting to play iconic
   musical genius Aretha Franklin,” said Carolyn Bernstein, EVP, global
   scripted content and documentary films, National Geographic. “On the
   heels of her Tony Award-winning turn in ‘The Color Purple’ and breakout
   performance in upcoming feature film ‘Harriet,’ we can’t wait to see
   Cynthia bring her fierceness to the role as the Queen of Soul.”

   Erivo is a Tony-, Emmy- and Grammy Award-winning actress who burst onto
   West End and Broadway stages in “The Color Purple” and has taken the
   big screen by storm. Erivo will next star in Kasi Lemmons’ “Harriet,”
   in which she will bring the legacy of Harriet Tubman to the big screen.
   On the television side, she will star in the HBO series “The Outsider,”
   based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Erivo will also star
   alongside Daisy Ridley and David Oyelowo in the anticipated sci-fi
   thriller “Chaos Walking,” from director Doug Liman, and in John
   Ridley’s “Needle in a Timestack” alongside Orlando Bloom, Freida Pinto
   and Leslie Odom Jr. In addition, Erivo is set to executive produce and
   star in Warner Bros.’ musical take on the American folk tale of “Rip
   Van Winkle.”

   GENIUS dramatizes the fascinating stories of the world’s most brilliant
   innovators, exploring their extraordinary achievements along with their
   volatile, passionate and complex personal relationships. The third
   season of the anthology series will explore Franklin’s musical genius
   and incomparable career, as well as the immeasurable impact and lasting
   influence she has had on music and culture around the world. Grammy
   Award winner Franklin was a gospel prodigy and outspoken civil rights
   champion and is widely considered to be the greatest singer of the past
   50 years, receiving countless honors throughout her career.

   Without knowing how to read music, Franklin taught herself to play the
   piano; at the young age of 12, she began to record songs and sing on
   gospel tours with her father. She signed her first record deal at age
   18 with Columbia Records. In 1966 she moved to Atlantic Records, where
   she recorded many of her most iconic songs. In 1979 she began a 40-year
   friendship and partnership with Clive Davis, which produced a number of
   hit songs, including the highest charting and bestselling song of her
   career, “I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me),” a duet with George Michael.
   The legendary singer is one of the world’s bestselling musical artists
   of all time, with more than 75 million records sold globally during her
   career. Her voice was identified as a “natural resource” by her home
   state of Michigan.

   Previously announced, Suzan-Lori Parks, Pulitzer Prize-winning
   playwright of “Topdog/Underdog,” is executive producer and showrunner
   for GENIUS: ARETHA. Imagine is partnering with Warner Music Group for
   this third season, which will again be executive produced by Imagine’s
   Brian Grazer, Ron Howard and Francie Calfo. Legendary hit record
   producer Clive Davis and Atlantic Records Chairman and CEO Craig
   Kallman have also joined as executive producers. Returning executive
   producers include Ken Biller (Genius: Einstein, Genius: Picasso), Gigi
   Pritzker and Rachel Shane (MWM Studios), and Sam Sokolow (EUE/Sokolow).
   Diana Son joins as executive producer. In addition, Imagine’s Anna Culp
   serves as producer alongside Peter Afterman.

   Erivo is repped by United Talent Agency, ID, Authentic Talent &
   Literary Management, and Pekioff Mahan.

   National Geographic, the company behind the recent Oscar-winning and
   seven Emmy-winning FREE SOLO, in 2017 premiered the first season of
   GENIUS, which starred Geoffrey Rush as the brilliant scientist Albert
   Einstein. Biller was showrunner and creator for the multi-Emmy-winning
   GENIUS: PICASSO and GENIUS: EINSTEIN. GENIUS: EINSTEIN earned 10 Emmy
   nominations, including Outstanding Limited Series, as well as Golden
   Globe and SAG Award nominations for Rush. The follow-up season, GENIUS:
   PICASSO, starred Antonio Banderas as the titular Spanish painter and
   matched much of the success of its predecessor, earning seven Emmy
   nominations — and two wins — as well as Golden Globe and SAG Award
   nominations for Banderas.

   Imagine has a history of creating timeless and culturally impactful
   films, shows and documentaries in the world of music, including the
   Academy Award-winning film “8 Mile,” the Grammy Award-winning
   documentary “The Beatles: Eight Days a Week — The Touring Years,” the
   critically acclaimed documentary “Pavarotti” and Emmy-winning
   television drama “Empire.” The company also produced the film “Get on
   Up” about James Brown, and many documentaries, including “Jay Z’s Made
   in America,” “Katy Perry: Part of Me” and “Once Were Brothers: Robbie
   Robertson and The Band.” Imagine is currently in production on the Hulu
   series “Wu-Tang: An American Saga” and the sixth season of “Empire”; it
   is also developing a film version of the musical “tick, tick … BOOM!”
   with Lin-Manuel Miranda directing, and a documentary about legendary
   musician Louis Armstrong.
