Benefits

   Network with other cancer research funders
   Join our active network of senior representatives from cancer research
   funding organizations across the world. ICR partners share news,
   information, expertise and resources regularly and meet annually to
   improve coordination among research organizations.

   Portfolio analysis tools for strategic planning
   Gain access to enhanced portfolio analysis tools and cancer research
   funding information in the partner area of the ICRP website. ICRP
   organizations share data in a common format, making it possible to
   compare and contrast the research portfolios of public, non-profit, and
   governmental research agencies.

   Your research in the spotlight
   Display basic information about your research portfolio on our public
   website. Researchers can then search the ICRP to avoid duplication in
   grant applications and identify potential collaborators.

   Evaluation resources and expertise
   Access ICRP’s repository of research evaluations highlighting best
   practices and tried and tested methodologies.

   View our partners' testimonials to find out more about how ICRP could
   benefit your organization.

Being a Partner

   With ICRP support, Partners submit research portfolio funding data to
   the database regularly. Awards on the ICRP database are coded using a
   common classification system organized into six broad areas of
   scientific interest in cancer research complemented by a standard
   cancer type coding scheme. ICRP can offer coding for new partners and
   access to automated coding methodologies.

   Partners are asked to nominate specific point(s) of contact to
   participate in our meetings. Our monthly teleconferences are organized
   on a rotation to ensure that partners in different time zones can
   participate regularly.

   Partners are asked to adhere to our Policies and Procedures in
   accordance with our co-operative and collaborative ways of working.

   Costs: Annual membership fees contribute to ICRP’s running costs and
   provision of resources. Costs are tiered according to the size of the
   partner organization and range from $500 to $25,000 per annum. Further
   details are included in our Partnership Guide.

Apply for Partnership

   We welcome applications from individual funding organizations or from
   consortia of funders. Before applying, please review our Partnership
   Guide and application form. Please do not hesitate to contact us for a
   discussion before applying.

   Process
   Once you submit an application, you will receive an immediate
   notification by email. Our membership committee will review your
   application against the eligibility criteria and you will receive a
   decision within a few weeks.

   Once your application is approved, we will work with you to prepare
   your cancer research portfolio for upload, introduce you to the
   partnership and register your ICRP representatives. Please note that we
   can only give access to the partner database once your first data
   upload has been received.

   ICRP’s mission is to improve access to information about global cancer
   research funding, and enable cancer research funding organizations to
   work collaboratively to address common challenges.

   Our annual meetings are a great opportunity to connect with other
   cancer research funders, identify gaps in funding, explore options for
   collaborative funding and exchange innovative ideas. Registration is
   free – please see below for information about past and forthcoming
   meetings.

2020 Annual Meeting

   We would like to extend a warm invitation to cancer research funders
   worldwide to attend the International Cancer Research Partnership’s
   2020 annual meeting. The meeting will be held on May 12 – 13, 2020 in
   London, hosted by the UK National Cancer Research Institute.
   Representatives from major cancer research organizations in the US,
   Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan attend the meeting, in addition to
   guests from other cancer research organizations worldwide. ICRP is a
   unique alliance of cancer organizations (currently representing over
   130 major cancer research funders and institutions) working together to
   enhance global collaboration and strategic coordination of research. We
   aim to improve access to information about cancer research being
   conducted, explore opportunities for cooperation between funding
   agencies and enable our members to maximize the impact of their
   independent efforts. A report of last year’s meeting can be found here.

   The 2020 meeting will include a range of sessions:

   • Promoting global partnerships: innovative strategies to drive
   international collaborations in cancer research

   • Hot topics in cancer research: including Living with and beyond
   cancer, Prevention, Personalised Medicine, Open Access, Childhood
   cancer, and Harnessing & linking real-world data to accelerate cancer
   research

   • Trends in cancer research – gaps and opportunities for co-funding

   • Networking opportunities with other cancer research funders


   Further details and a full programme will be released later this year.

   If you have any questions, or want to be included on the mailing list,

ICRP Partners and Funding Organizations

   ICRP partners represent a wide range of governmental, public and
   non-profit cancer research funding organizations from across the world.
   Our membership includes organizations focused on one type of cancer
   through to health research organizations supporting research into many
   cancer types. Partners are full members and provide nominated contact
   points for ICRP, and vote on any changes to strategic direction or
   policies.

   Some funding organizations have joined ICRP as part of a consortium.
   They enjoy full access to the ICRP partner site, can participate in
   meetings, analyses and networking. Their data submissions are
   coordinated by the nominated partner. Former funding organizations
   (e.g., organizations who have ceased grant funding) whose data is still
   included in the ICRP database are also listed.

   Find out more about our partners and funding organizations using the
   map below.
