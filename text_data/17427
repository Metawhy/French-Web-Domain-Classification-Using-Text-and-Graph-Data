Prep-Ahead Meals From Scratch

   In Prep-Ahead Meals From Scratch, I share multiple ways to prepare
   large batches of different staples that can then be quickly combined
   into a variety of easy meals through the week. The cookbook includes
   batch cooking techniques for beef, chicken, pork, beans, and rice. Each
   chapter comes with delicious recipes such as Mongolian Beef Meatballs,
   Chicken Cordon Bleu Rice Bake, Pulled Pork Stuffed Sweet Potatoes,
   Mediterranean Beans and Rice, and Cajun Spiced Cauliflower.
   By batch cooking, you can prep the ingredients for multiple
   family-friendly meals at once, ultimately saving time and money. In
   Prep-Ahead Meals From Scratch, I set out to redefine “convenience food”
   by sharing 100 quick and easy recipes, offer speedy food prep
   techniques, and share money saving shopping strategies and meal
   planning tips.

Welcome. I'm Alea!

   On Premeditated Leftovers I share simple recipes made with whole foods,
   practical shopping tips, time saving techniques, and meal planning
   strategies. I also share tips for minimizing food waste, so more of the
   food that is purchased ends up on the table.
   While volunteering as a budget counselor, I realized that food is the
   element of most people’s budgets where they have the greatest control.
   I set out to develop low-cost recipes from scratch to prove it’s
   possible to create delicious meals on a limited budget. Eating well
   while spending less is about more than just creating recipes using
   inexpensive ingredients; it’s about creatively combining ingredients so
   you don’t feel deprived and are inspired to stick to your budget.
