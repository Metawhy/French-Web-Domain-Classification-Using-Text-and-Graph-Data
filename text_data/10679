   Sometimes I’m unsure about an item until it arrives in the mail and I
   can try it on. 💁🏼‍♀️ Sometimes even after I try it on, I have to mull
   it over for a bit. And sometimes, I order a dress, take photos in it,
   see the photos and go - “you know what, I may not be so crazy about
   that dress after all!” This dress falls into the last category. It’s
   super cute and I’m convinced it would look great on someone else, just
   not me! I’m glad I gave it a shot though - being open and trying new
   things is the best way to find what you really love and will wear
   forever. 💃🤩🙌 . . 📷 @jennifercavilla #lookforless #budgetfashion

   #weekendstyle #orlandoblog #orlandoblogger You know that feeling when
   you’re really busy - hectic, rushing from one thing to the next,
   constantly forgetting things and missing deadlines? I’ve been operating
   that way lately. I'll think “well, it’s just for today, or this week,”
   but how long has it really been? At some point it just becomes normal
   and NOT being busy is the thing producing anxiety. (As if without
   activity and people needing things from us, we might cease to exist.😳)
   As I sat down to write yet another rushed blog post, I decided to slow
   down and be intentional instead. I needed this reminder and sharing it
   here, on the off chance that it’s a welcome reminder for someone else!
   Slow down. Sit in silence. Enjoy the rest. 🙏💕😘 . . 📷 @jennifercavilla
