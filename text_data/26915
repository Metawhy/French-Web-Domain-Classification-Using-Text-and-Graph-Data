   B&H ships most international packages with DHL Express. Shipping fees
   are calculated on a combined basis of weight, value (for insurance
   purposes), and destination. Some orders are shipped in multiple
   parcels. We do not add additional fees to your order if we ship in
   multiple parcels. DHL Mail is also available for many destinations. DHL
   Mail is a hybrid service from DHL that delivers to many international
   countries. The final delivery from this service is by the postal
   service of that specific country.

   Select Special Order items may be shipped to us from our supplier
   before being shipped to you. Oversized items that don't fit Parcel
   Services standards will be shipped via an International freight
   forwarder via Door-to-Airport or Door-to-Door service, depending on
   your location. The carrier will call you to inform you of your delivery
   method.

Fees & Shipping Cost

   Your country's import duties, taxes and fees are never included in the
   item and shipping totals. For these fees, please refer to our Duties &
   Taxes section. Original outbound shipping costs are nonrefundable.

Item Restrictions

   Before completing any purchase, please check all product Specifications
   ("SPECS" tab) to make sure you're choosing compatible items that will
   work in your country. In addition, please confirm that your country's
   import rules and regulations will allow you to import the item you're
   purchasing.

   Manufacturer or government restrictions occasionally oblige us to block
   certain products from shipping outside the USA. We have a special PAL
   Video Equipment category for countries that use the PAL system.
   Manufacturer's rebates may not be valid for merchandise shipped outside
   the USA.

Refused or Returned Deliveries

   If an order is refused or returned to us due to inaccurate or incorrect
   address information or because it was declined or undeliverable, B&H
   reserves the right to retain the original shipping/handling fee and to
   charge the payment method originally used for costs we incur related to
   the return of the undeliverable packages or merchandise to us.

Signature and Time

   All orders are shipped "signature required" upon receipt. International
   orders received before 7am Eastern Daylight Time (GMT -04:00) will be
   shipped the same day. To avoid higher than normal shipping and duties
   charges, orders containing multiple items will be consolidated in one
   location prior to shipping. Your order may be delayed by an extra
   business day. We will notify you via email, if your order will be
   delayed.

Stock Exceptions

   Due to the complexities of export regulations and international
   shipments, all special orders will be delivered to our warehouse and
   then shipped to you. This enables B&H to better support your shipment
   during transit.

Attested Documents

   Certain countries require your order's documents to be attested by the
   chamber of commerce. In the event that you need attested documents
   there will be a $40 USD fee per document requiring a signature along
   with a shipping charge to send you the documents.

Rebates

   Manufacturer's rebates may not be valid for merchandise shipped outside
   the USA. Please check the information in your cart to confirm pricing.

Multiple Items

   To avoid higher than normal shipping and duty fees, orders containing
   multiple items stored in different warehouses will be consolidated at
   one location prior to shipping. Therefore, your order may be delayed by
   an extra business day. We will notify you via email if your order will
   be delayed.

Policies & Pricing

International Pricing & Payment Options

   All non-US currency amounts displayed are estimates provided for
   general information purposes only. We do not guarantee the accuracy of
   any foreign currency information.

   The final amount shown in your cart is in US dollars. The estimated
   product price does not include customs, duties and/or taxes. Your
   credit card company may charge you a conversion fee.

   Any charges or refunds to your credit card will be issued in US
   dollars. Refund amounts may be more or less than the purchase price due
   to fluctuating exchange rates. PayPal Credit, Google Checkout™ and
   mail-in rebates are not available for international purchases.

   International orders are charged as soon as you click "Place Order".

   For shipments to Russia, the maximum order value (including shipping
   charges) is 5000 Rubles per shipment.

Returns and Replacements

   If you return a product to us, you will become the exporter from the
   destination country. That title and any risk of loss transfer to us
   upon our receipt of the merchandise. Shipping carriers will assist you
   in recovering your duties and taxes for a fee. Please contact shipping
   carriers directly to initiate this service.

Privacy

   Your privacy is important to us, and we strive to exceed your
   expectations for secure data. Nevertheless, cross-border shipments are
   subject to inspection by customs authorities. We may also be called
   upon to provide certain order, shipment and product information to our
   international carriers. Carriers may communicate such information to
   customs authorities for the purpose of facilitating customs clearance
   and compliance with local laws.

Rebates

   Manufacturer's rebates may not be valid for merchandise shipped outside
   the USA. Please check the information in your cart to confirm pricing.

Duties, Taxes, Customs & Other Fees

   International orders are generally subject to local import duties and
   taxes (VAT). B&H offers the convenience of handling these fees on your
   behalf for specific countries and for many items. If your order
   qualifies for this option, it will be presented to you during the
   checkout process. In some cases by adding the item(s) to your cart and
   indicating to which country you are shipping, you can see applicable
   duties and taxes. If none are shown, you will still need to check with
   that country as to their regulations regarding duties and taxes.

   If you opt to pre-pay, we will collect and pay any local import duties
   and taxes on your behalf. By choosing this service, you authorize B&H
   to charge any additional import duties, VAT or taxes to the original
   payment method. You also authorize us to charge any subsequent delivery
   fee resulting from incorrectly identifying your delivery location as a
   business vs. residential address to the original payment method.

   If you decline our pre-payment service, B&H cannot be responsible for,
   nor can we offer, any specific advice regarding any customs-related
   fees that you may incur. For specific information, please consult with
   your local government import office.

   We collect local sales tax (8.875%) on purchases made in our NYC
   SuperStore and corresponding percentages in any state requiring sales
   tax collection on remote purchases. Sales taxes are not VATs and cannot
   be recovered by non-USA visitors upon returning home.

Non-USA Currency

Payment and Currency

   All orders are charged when you click "Place Order". PayPal Credit and
   mail-in rebates are not available payment options. All transactions on
   our website are calculated in US dollars (USD) even when using our
   website's currency converter. Please review your financial
   institution's policies when making purchases in USD as there may be
   extra charges incurred from the transaction. In the unfortunate event
   that a credit will need to be issued it also will be calculated in USD.
   Return currency conversion will also be calculated at the current
   currency price and may cause a change from the original local currency
   paid.

Non-USA Currency Disclaimer

   All non-US currency amounts displayed are estimates provided for
   general information purposes only. We do not guarantee the accuracy of
   any non-USA currency information.

   The final amount shown in your cart is in US dollars. The estimated
   product price does not include customs, duty fees and/or taxes. Your
   credit card company may charge you a conversion fee.

   Any charges or refunds to your credit card will be issued in US
   dollars. Refund amounts may be more or less than the purchase price due
   to fluctuating exchange rates.

Tax Exemptions

   Government, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, public
   charities, churches and other religious associations usually qualify
   for tax-exempt purchases. Once approved, customers may make tax-exempt
   purchases on behalf of their organizations.

   To apply for a tax-exempt account, apply online today.

   If you have received a Tax-Exempt Customer Code, please log in and
   start enjoying your benefits.

Canada

Free Shipping to Canada on Most Orders over $99 USD

   Most Orders over $99 ship free to Canada! The $99 order total is
   calculated after all rebates and bundle discounts have been applied.
   Gift Cards, freight charges, duties and taxes do not count towards the
   qualifying order total.

   Transit time is up to 7-10 days. Orders must be prepaid to qualify for
   Free Shipping. Certain merchandise is excluded from this offer based on
   item characteristics.

PST (Provincial Sales Tax)

   All orders are imported to Canada as casual goods and are subject to a
   Provincial Sales Tax (PST). If you are claiming reimbursement of PST
   from the CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency), you may need to submit a
   B3 customs form with your request. Please contact our Customer Service
   Department to obtain help procuring this documentation.

Canadian Shipping

   B&H Offers free shipping to Canada via ground service. We offer our
   customers the option of either DDP (Delivered Duties Paid) or DDU
   (Delivered Duties Unpaid).

   With DDP  duties and taxes will be collected by B&H Photo and
   transmitted to the carrier with proper documentation to clear into
   Canada. We will collect an amount that's equivalent to the duties,
   taxes and other applicable cross-border fees along with your
   merchandise.

   With DDU  the carrier will contact you to collect duties, taxes and
   other applicable cross-border fees directly. B&H has negotiated with
   carriers for a minimal fee to cover clearance charges. We will provide
   carriers with all proper documentation before shipping.

   With DDU only  you also have the option to clear your order with a
   different licensed brokerage house. Please inform the carrier as soon
   as they make contact; they will hand over the package to your appointed
   broker with all relevant documentation.

   Please note that with your selection of DDP or DDU, the carrier may
   need to obtain your verbal consent and/or require a signature on a POA
   (Power of Attorney) or your BN (Canadian Business Number) to clear your
   order through the CBSA.

FedEx DDP Shipments Legal Notice:

   Please note that for DDP shipments of merchandise to Canada, the
   Canadian purchaser/recipient of the merchandise is the importer of
   record (the “Importer”) and is responsible for complying with all
   Canadian laws and regulations for importing such merchandise into
   Canada. When you place an order for shipment to Canada, you are
   authorizing a Canadian customs broker designated by us or our
   contractor to act as agent on the Importer’s behalf (whether the
   Importer is you or another person) with Canada Border Services Agency
   (“CBSA”), to clear, report, and account for the imported merchandise
   with CBSA and remit to CBSA all applicable duties, fees and taxes
   arising from such importation, on behalf of the Importer in accordance
   with all applicable Canadian legal requirements.

Shipping

Fees

   Your country's import duties, taxes and fees are never included in the
   item and shipping totals. For these fees please refer to our Duties &
   Taxes section.

Shipping Cost

   Original outbound shipping costs are nonrefundable.

Item Restrictions

   Before completing your purchase always confirm your items are
   compatible and will work in your country. Also you need to confirm your
   country's import rules and regulations will allow you to import the
   item you are purchasing. Manufacturer or government restrictions
   occasionally oblige us to block certain products from shipping outside
   the USA.

Payment and Currency

   All orders are charged when you click "Place Order." PayPal Credit and
   mail-in rebates are not available payment options. All transactions on
   our website are processed in US dollars (USD), even when using our
   website's currency converter. Please review your financial
   institution's policies when making purchases in USD, as there may be
   extra charges incurred from the transaction. In the unfortunate event
   that a credit will need to be issued it will also be returned in USD.
   Any return currency conversions will be performed at present-day
   currency rates, and so may result in adjustments to the original local
   currency paid.

Signature and Time

   All orders are shipped "signature required" upon receipt. International
   orders received before 7am Eastern Daylight Time (GMT -04:00) will be
   shipped the same day.

Rebates

   Manufacturer's rebates may not be valid for merchandise shipped outside
   the USA. Please check the information in your cart to confirm pricing.

   multiple items stored in different warehouses will be consolidated at

   If your order is traveling from our warehouse to a USA address, you
   will get an Expected Delivery Date for each shipping option during
   checkout. These dates are based on carrier shipping practices,
   destination and the items you order. Expected delivery dates are
   estimates. Orders may be delayed due to verification protocols, weather
   or the time of order placement. Stock exceptions cannot be held to
   expected delivery dates. Orders may be delivered in separate shipments.

   You may generally expect these items to take about 7-10 days to arrive
   at USA destinations, unless specified otherwise.

   Special Order items: If one of the items in your order qualifies as a
   stock exception, we will ask you during checkout whether you'd like us
   to ship your full order when all items are in stock, or if you'd like
   to split a shipment (at no extra cost). The estimated delivery shown
   reflects the shipping time once your item reaches our warehouse.
   (International customers: If you choose to have a non-regularly stocked
   item priced below $500 shipped separately, it will be shipped via USPS
   once it arrives at our warehouse.)

   If we email you a tracking number during the day, the information may
   not post to the carrier's website until that evening. You may also
   track your order on our website (no login required with single order
   lookup).

   We generally pack orders Sunday-Friday. However, orders packed on
   Sundays or legal holidays do not ship until the following business day.

Introducing GoPro HERO8 Black & the 360-Degree MAX: The Latest and Greatest

   By Staff Writer |
   5 days ago
     *
     *

   0Share

   Action-camera industry leader GoPro’s latest releases really are its
   greatest (to date): the HERO8 Black lets you concentrate on your sport
   or activity while it brings new levels of smoothness and ease of use to
   your 4K video capture. The versatile MAX offers both 360˚ capture with
   in-camera stitching and a HERO-style mode, 270 panoramic photos without
   the need to pan, and a large touchscreen display.

HERO8

   Highlights of the HERO8 Black and its accessories include a new,
   pocket-friendly streamlined design, quick-change mounting, and new
   extended battery and accessory-mounting options. And evolving from the
   standard action camera wide-angle view, you can now simply tap on the
   HERO8 Black to switch between Narrow, Linear, Wide and SuperView
   digital lens modes.
   GoPro HERO8 Black GoPro HERO8 Black

   While maintaining the crisp UHD 4K60 video capture, 33' waterproofing,
   and 1080p live streaming of the HERO7 Black, this newest iteration
   shines in multiple upgrades such as HyperSmooth 2.0. Available in all
   resolutions and at all frame rates, HyperSmooth 2.0 offers a choice of
   a wide, stabilized view or a tighter view with maximum smoothness,
   while improving low-light performance, and featuring in-app horizon
   leveling for your more off-kilter moves.

   Built-in, folding “fingers” enable you to swap mounts on the HERO8
   Black in mere seconds, and a new side door is designed for faster
   battery changes. In addition to offering multiple fields of view, the
   HERO8 Black’s lens provides twice the impact resistance of its
   predecessor. Use the optional Media Mod to attach pro-style accessories
   like mics, small lights, or a second LCD to your HERO, or opt for the
   Battery Mod to get 2.5x extended run time when filming a longer event.

   Use the TimeWarp 2.0 feature to record super-stabilized time-lapse
   videos with the ability to slow down the speed to real time when you
   want to focus on a particular moment. TimeWarp 2.0 can also
   automatically adjust its speed based on your motion, type of scene, and
   lighting. For your night owl activities, Night Lapse offers a choice of
   1080p to 4K night time-lapse videos.

   Still photo options at 12MP have been ramped up with improved HDR (high
   dynamic range) in SuperPhoto + and with the LiveBurst feature. This
   short burst of frames captures 1.5 seconds before and after your shot
   so you can choose the best frame or share it as a quick video. And
   while it won’t “throw another shrimp on the barbie” for you, the GoPro
   HERO8 Black understands up to 15 voice commands in more than 12
   languages, including Australian-accented English.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/nuynecQJk-w?rel=0

MAX

   The GoPro MAX may be small, but its in-camera stitching, 5.6K30
   capture, HyperSmooth stabilization, and touchscreen display are huge!
   Now you can view your footage directly on your MAX, frame your shot
   more easily, and even grab a selfie in HERO mode. The ability to switch
   between the 360 mode and the HERO mode gives you in effect, two cameras
   in one.
   GoPro MAX GoPro MAX

360˚ Mode

   The MAX shares the same ability to “punch in” and reframe your 360˚
   video as its Fusion predecessor, as well as offering 16' waterproof
   depth, built-in GPS, still photo capture, voice commands, and 360˚
   audio. New features include PowerPano for capturing spectacular,
   distortion-free 270˚ panoramic photos without having to act as your own
   motion-control head, in-camera stitching for quicker, easier offloading
   and editing, and user-assignable on-screen shortcuts for your favorite
   functions.

HERO Mode

   As with the HERO8, in the MAX HERO mode you can choose between Narrow,
   Linear, Wide and SuperView digital lens modes, capture amazing
   time-lapse sequences in TimeWarp, and use the Horizon Leveling to keep
   your craziest stunts or silliest antics on a stable plane. You can also
   use the HERO mode to live-stream in 1080p, frame up a selfie with the
   on-camera display, and use Scene Detection for the best results at the
   beach, ski slopes, or underwater.

   Nifty accessories for the MAX include replacement lens protectors, lens
   caps, and side doors. The MAX Grip & Tripod can be used with any GoPro,
   but is specifically designed to record in 360˚ without getting the grip
   in your shot. The  MAX dual battery charger automatically determines

   Supercharger for up to 48% quicker charging.
