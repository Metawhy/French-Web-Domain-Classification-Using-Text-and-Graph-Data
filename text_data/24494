Hybrid Chair

   The Hybrid Chair is currently Kickstarting by Rotterdam based Studio
   Lorier. A desk chair by day and a lounger by night (or during breaks),
   the piece is the ultimate small space staple. The frame, made of
   locally sourced solid oak wood, facilitates the transformation
   seamlessly. The chair comes in several toned down colors and may be
   accompanied by the footstool, which in turn can be transformed into a
   side table. Clever. Check out the video after the break and pledge to
   get your own.

Hanging Wooden Planters

   I’m in favor of hanging planters for the obvious space-saving reasons.
   This collection by Fernweh Woodworking is especially lovely. Made from
   the natural solid wood, these pieces are sculpturesque and wholesome at
   the same time. Justin, the creative force behind the brand, who is a
   former Marine Officer and Wildland Firefighter, created this
   woodworking studio in Bend, Oregon. He develops a variety of products,
   including these planters, which come in two finishes, black walnut and
   maple.

House-Shaped Beds for Kids

   This fun design for the small kids’ bedroom was completed by Bulgarian
   bureau Another Studio. They created two custom house-shaped beds,
   completely surrounded by shelving. The bases of the beds serve as
   storage too. Additional small shelves emulate house windows, which is
   my favorite element in the entire concept. And once all this custom
   shelving is used to store kids’ paraphernalia, the rest of the room
   appears quite spacious. More photos after the break.

São Paulo Apartment Annex

   Architects from São Paulo based studio Vaga came up with the clever way
   to add space to a small home. They have built an annex that
   incorporates two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a rooftop deck. The sliding
   door allows switching between privacy and open use of the spaces. The
   rooftop deck is used for a herb garden and as an extra hang-out space.
   Cool modern idea. See more photos after the break.

Folding Desk Shelf

   Woodlyn Folding Desk Shelf from Urban Outfitters presents a clever idea
   for an improvised workspace that takes virtually no room when not in
   use. Perfectly functional as a shelf, the piece can be unfolded to
   provide a writing (or typing) surface. Available for purchase here.

All-in-one Living Cube

   How can a large piece of furniture safe space? By combining several
   rooms in itself. The piece called Kammerspiel (Intimate Theatre) is the
   largest piece of furniture the German designer Nils Holger Moormann
   ever created. And its role is to rethink the approach to living in a
   small space. The item includes sleeping, eating, working, and reading
   areas. A staircase that doubles as a set of drawers leads to the
   bedroom level. The inside of the cube provides space for the walk-in
   closet and pantry. See more photos after the break.

Stylish Tiny House

   As the Tiny House market grows bigger, the design of these dwellings
   becomes more and more elegant and lavish. Take for example this artisan
   little item, built by Handcrafted Movement. Beautifully laid out in a
   24′ x 8.5′ trailer, the house has all the comforts of a much large
   home. Plus quite a few clever hidden storage ideas. See more photos
   after the break for a full tour.

   Standing desks are all the rage these days and this clever contribution
   to the trend by Humble Works is worth a mention. I love the flexibility
   of this design. Thanks to the multiple slots, anyone can find the
   correct position for the monitor and keyboard shelves in relation to
   their eye level and overall height. The piece folds flat when not in
   use.

   Swiss company Kitchoo created a kitchen unit that will fit the tiniest
   of spaces. In spite of its size, the piece includes all basic
   appliances: sink, two burners, dishwasher, and refrigerator. And thanks
   to clever covers, it can even provide some counter space. It comes in a
   variety of finishes and configurations.
