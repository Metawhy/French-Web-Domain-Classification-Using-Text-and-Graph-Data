Was Venus ever habitable?

   Posted by Deborah Byrd in Space | 12 hours ago

   Today, Venus is hot, dry … hellish. But maybe not always. Scientists
   created 5 new computer simulations of Venus, all with some water
   coverage. All 5 models showed Venus as stable, temperate and with some
   water for 3 billion years.

Why we need to get back to Venus

   Posted by EarthSky Voices in Space | 13 hours ago

   This hot neighbor, with its surface veiled by thick clouds, hasn’t
   benefited from the attention showered on Mars and the moon. But Venus
   might offer insights into Earth’s future.
   On June 5-6, 2012, NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory collected images
   of one of the rarest predictable solar events: the transit of Venus
   across the face of the Sun. NASA/SDO, AIA

Venus to take center stage in October 2020 observation campaign

   Posted by EarthSky in Space | 14 hours ago

   Launched in 2018, the BepiColombo mission will have the first of its 2
   encounters with Venus – while on its way to Mercury – in October 2020.
   Coordinated observations at that time will involve 2 spacecraft and
   multiple ground-based telescopes.
   Akatsuki today, September 25, 2019. This Japanese spacecraft is also
   called the Venus Climate Orbiter. Launched in 2010, it originally
   failed to enter orbit around Venus late that year. It orbited the sun
   for 5 years, until JAXA engineers were able - through firings of its
   thrusters - to place it into a highly elliptical Venus orbit in 2015.
   It's currently the only spacecraft orbiting Venus. Image via JAXA.

Scientists use drones to probe earthly dust devils, with an eye toward Mars

   Posted by Deborah Byrd in Earth | Space | 1 day ago

   Dust devils are common are common on Earth, but ubiquitous on Mars, a
   desert world. Scientists are using drones carrying cameras and other
   instruments to gain new insights.

Meet Delta Cephei, a famous variable star

   Posted by Bruce McClure and Deborah Byrd in Astronomy Essentials |
   Brightest Stars | 2 days ago

   Delta Cephei doubles in brightness on a precise schedule, every 5.36
   days. Its brightness changes are tied to its absolute brightness. Learn
   how this star helped establish the known distance scale of our galaxy
   and universe.
   Like lights in a dark tunnel, stars in the distant universe become
   fainter as they are farther away. But, because they pulsate at a
   particular rate always correlated to their intrinsic brightnesses,
   Cepheid variable stars reveal their own true distances. Image via The
   Last Word on Nothing

Could a melting exomoon explain Tabby’s Star?

   Posted by Paul Scott Anderson in Space | 2 days ago

   This star undergoes a long-term dimming that’s so mysterious it was, at
   one time, proposed as possible evidence of an alien culture. Now,
   scientists say, a disk of debris – torn from a melting exomoon – might
   explain Tabby’s Star.

   mysterious dimming of the star KIC 8462852, also known as Boyajian's
   Star or Tabby's Star. Image via NASA/JPL-Caltech.

Why Earth has 4 seasons

   Posted by Deanna Conners in Earth | 3 days ago

   Some assume our planet’s changing distance from the sun causes the
   change in the seasons. That’s logical, but not the case for Earth.

All you need to know: September equinox

   Posted by Deborah Byrd in Astronomy Essentials | 3 days ago

   We have an equinox coming up on September 23. Happy autumn, Northern
   Hemisphere. Happy spring, Southern Hemisphere.
   View at EarthSky Community Photos. | First sunrise of autumn, 2019,
   from our friend Dr Ski in the Philippines. He wrote: "Of course, in the
   jungle, there is no autumn. We only have 2 seasons here: Monsoon Season
   and Not Monsoon Season." Thanks Dr Ski!

An astronomer contemplates the equinox

   Posted by Guy Ottewell in Astronomy Essentials | Human World | 3 days

   You can think of the equinox not as a whole day, but as a point along
   Earth’s orbit. Want to understand that better? Guy Ottewell offers some
   insights.

The 2nd-fastest pulsar, now with gamma rays

   Posted by Deborah Byrd in Space | 4 days ago

   Pulsars are the compact remnants of supernovae. They have strong
   magnetic fields and rotate rapidly. This one is spinning 707 times a
   second! Astronomers just discovered this pulsar is emitting high-energy
   gamma rays.
   Artist's illustation of another millisecond pulsar (in this case, PSR
   J1311?3430). Inflow of material from a companion star accelerated it up
   to hundreds of rotations in a single second. In this illustration, the
   pulsar swings its radio (green) and gamma-ray (magenta) beams past
   Earth with every spin, so that we see it as pulsing extremely rapidly.

Last quarter moon is September 22

   Posted by Deborah Byrd in Moon Phases | 4 days ago

   The moon reaches its last quarter phase on September 22, 2019 at
   2:41 UTC. In the coming week, watch for it to rise in the east in the
   hours after midnight, waning thinner each morning.
   View at EarthSky Community Photos | Dr Ski in Valencia, Philippines
   caught the last quarter moon shortly after it rose around midnight on
   the morning of September 22, 2019. This moon phase is perfect for
   helping you envision the location of the sun ... below your feet.
   Thanks, Dr Ski!

Are day and night equal at equinoxes?

   Posted by Bruce McClure in Astronomy Essentials | Earth | 5 days ago

   September 23 is the equinox. The word means “equal night.” Days and
   nights are nearly equal now at the equinox, but not quite. Here’s why.
   Also, we’ve got a new word for you, “equilux.” It’s the word for when
   day and night are, in fact, equal.

Today in science: Happy birthday Albert J. Myer

   Posted by Deanna Conners in Earth | 6 days ago

   As you check your local weather forecast today, give a nod to Albert J.
   Myer, born on this date in 1828, who helped to establish the US
   National Weather Service.
