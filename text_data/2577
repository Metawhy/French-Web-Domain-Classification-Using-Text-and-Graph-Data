About The Superhero Academy

   The Superhero Academy is the backbone of Superhero Jacked.  This is
   where members soar to unleash their inner superhero.  This is what
   creates our SuperHumans.  Mike developed tactics over the course of his
   training, guinea pigging, and stages of his own fitness, that have
   allowed him to make the most sustainable training and nutrition style.
