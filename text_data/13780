Agritechture

   A unique way of combining urban agriculture, innovative technical
   solutions and architecture to meet the demand for efficient food
   production within cities.

Retro-fitting

   Plantagon can change the use of empty areas of existing real estate,
   integrating sustainable food production.
     * Office buildings basements
     * Residential buildings basements or underground parking
     * Factories
     * Custom made Concepts

   Conceptualization
   Conceptualization is the first, and perhaps the most critical step in
   the product creation process. Here, Plantagon analyses the customer’s
   requirements and environmental conditions to develop the most
   appropriate solution. Textual and diagrammatic descriptions of the
   concept are produced and agreed with the customer.

   This step includes:
     * Concept development
     * High level feasibility study and implementation plan
     * Visualizations

   Partner: Sweco AB

   Configuration
   This step involves the translation of the conceptual information into
   logical definition and materialization of functions required to support
   the concept. This is accomplished with detailed design and technical
   planning and robust financial planning to ensure product feasibility.
   In this step, there will be collaboration between all stakeholders to
   achieve final agreement on the proposed product and ensure
   implementation is as efficient as possible. The final output is the
   complete blueprint for the proposed project, ready for implementation.

   This step includes:
     * Detailed design
     * Technical optimization
     * Architectural Plans / Building Information Modeling (BIM)
     * Operating model
     * Project / Financial planning

   Partner: Sweco AB

   Implementation
   This phase involves the construction of the actual project and heavily
   relies on the preparation and planning carried out in the previous
   phases. It is critical to align all technical partners to ensure
   Plantagon delivers the world-class product that is demanded from the
   customer.

   This step includes:
     * Construction
     * Technical and operational setup
     * Establish distribution / supply chain channels
     * Training

   Partners: Sweco AB (project manager), 3rd party local engineering
   consultants, 3rd party local construction company.

   Operation
   In this step, Plantagon will assemble a highly specialized team to
   operate the plant and ensure output is optimized throughout the
   lifetime of the project.

   This step includes:
     * Day-to-day operations (supply chain, crop management and
       distribution)
     * Continuous improvement and quality control
     * Sales, Marketing and Administration

   Partner: 3rd party facility management, property management and (when
   quality can be ensured) operations (in Sweden, plant operations are
   outsourced to Samhall AB, supervised by Plantagon)

   Licensing
   Plantagon’s long term objective is to license solutions to third party
   developers and operators.

   The compensation may take the form of a lump sum royalty, royalty based
   on volume of production (running royalty) or right to use licensee’s
   technology (cross licensing).

Extension

   Plantagon’s solutions can be added to existing buildings in the form of
   an extension.

   In a dense city environment access to land is extremely low and the
   price is extremely high. A viable solution for sustainable urban food
   production must produce maximum volume of food on a minimum land area
   whilst using minimal resources and generating minimum waste.

The FoodWall®

Beautiful and Edible

   Cultivate beautiful food, produced completely without chemical
   pesticides and far beyond the standard we call ‘Organic’. Lets say
   there would be one in every tenth city-home in the world, it would save
   235 Million tonnes of CO2 emissions – equivalent to 2.5% of the Global
   Millennium Development goal.

Underground

Low Rent     Low transport     High yield

   In 2017 we are launching the first full-scale energy-smart underground
   facility in Stockholm, Sweden. During 2018 and 2019 we aim to establish
   nine additional facilities in office buildings in Stockholm and ten
   more in residential buildings in the rest of the country.

Retail Store

More Sales     Lower environmental impact

   CoolFarm in/store is a closed and vertical system with a clean and
   climatized environment inside, perfect to grow premium seedlings,
   microgreens, leafy greens, herbs and flowers. It uses 90% less water
   than common agriculture and it does not need pesticides nor herbicides.
   It is modular, whereby each module starts with approximately 100 square
   meters of production area. Its modularity is applicable both vertically
   and horizontally, providing a quick return of investment.

   The system has two columns of movable hydroponic growing beds, one
   vertical lift, a fertigation system, topnotch sensors to measure all
   the relevant variables for the plants, LED grow lights, an HVAC system,
   CoolFarm in/control system, an antechamber with positive differential
   pressure between the growing area and external environment to avoid
   contaminations. The system is intelligent, highly intuitive and its
   trays come to the operator by elevators when requested. It is ideal for
   growers, food distributors, grocery and supermarket chains,
   restaurants, hotels, cruises, research centers, medical centers and
   communities. in/store provides transparency, traceability and minimizes
   the food waste.

Container

Easy starting point

   A high-density mobile farm built inside an insulated, recycled shipping
   container. It is mobile, agile and its open framework design means that
   each unit can be continually improved as technology advances.

Mall

Fresh Food     Sustainable Shopping

   Increased footfalls, better tenant mix, attraction for high-end
   restaurants, new niche of stores for urban farming – huge positive
   environmental and social impact. Increased attractiveness for the city.

Vertical Farm

Fresh Food     Sustainable Building

   Even a small-scale vertical farm right in the heart of the city
   sometimes makes sense. Concepts developed prove that urban food
   production sold directly to consumers make the same profit for the
   real-estate developer as office rentals.

   World Food Building, Sweden
   unit one
   linköping
   Since the spring of 2009 Tekniska Verken and Plantagon have been
   discussing the potential of integrating modern urban agriculture into
   the Kallersta district in the city of Linköping, 2 hours south of the
   Swedish capital Stockholm. Initially the purpose was to ascertain
   whether access to locally cultivated vegetables would help develop
   Tekniska Verken’s existing symbiotic systems – by utilising waste heat
   and carbon dioxide from the adjacent biogas facility; by using low
   value return heat from the Gärstadverken; and by using surplus biomass
   from the greenhouse in biogas production. One fundamental idea was to
   have the vertical greenhouse become a landmark for the smart systems
   developed by Linköping.
   This marks the realization of the vision of creating functional
   sustainable solutions for the growing cities of today and tomorrow,
   where we can grow food in the cities in a resource-smart way, making
   use of the special conditions of the city.

   The Plantagon greenhouse, developed together with Sweco, is designed
   for vertical agriculture of vegetables in urban areas. In cooperation
   with several partners, Plantagon plans to develop integrated solutions
   for energy, excess heat, waste, CO2 and water.

   With this greenhouse we’re developing and fine-tuning the technical
   systems required for vertical farming in urban areas, together with
   several well-known Swedish partner companies. We want to gather
   expertise in the field, and our long-term objective is to create an
   international Center of Excellence for Urban Agriculture in Linköping.

World Food Building
       The WFB is our demonstration plant for the temperate zone, being
       built in Linköping, two hours south of Stockholm. It’s a 65 yard
       tall office building, producing /700 000 – /1 100 000 pounds of
       vegetables per year on the south façade. Play

Double Skin Facade
       One of the unique features with the Plantagon greenhouse is its
       façade. It makes it possible to maintain a controlled climate
       inside the greenhouse and is at the same time very energy
       efficient. Play

Pumice
       In a Plantagon greenhouse the plants grow in Pumice. The reasons
       for that are the fantastic properties when it comes to growing
       results and environmental effects. Play
     * img05

Disinfection
       Pumice has the unique ability that it could be reused over and over
       again. To ensure that no harmful bacteria or spores follow the
       pumice to the next crop, it has to be disinfected by using a
       microwave oven. Play

uPot
       Plantagon has invented a transportation system for greenhouses that
       can increase the production per square meter. The invention
       consists of an expandable pot that allows spacing between plants in
       two dimensions. Play

   Why?
   70%
   +3 billion
   80%
   + Brazil
     * By 2050 up to 70% of the earth’s population will reside in urban
       centers.
     * Until then human population will increase by about 3 billion,
       applying conservative estimates.
     * Over 80 % of land area suitable for farming is used for crop
       production
     * We will need further arable land the size of Brazil.

   Currently, we use 80% of the arable land we have access to globally. In
   the future, without significant change in today’s food production, it
   is estimated that at least 10-15% of the global vegetable production
   must take place inside cities by 2050 in order to maintain our current
   growth and consumption patterns.

   Due to these demographic and environmental factors, significant changes
   are taking place within the Agriculture sector. Trends are showing that
   urban areas are placing increasing strain on the food industry and
   associated resources such as water, energy and arable land. As a
   result, the global market is experiencing increased food price
   volatility and Governments around the world are taking drastic steps to
   mitigate the future risks and challenges associated with their
   development goals.

   Based on our urbanization trends, cities are becoming the hubs for the
   biggest human settlements and feeding the world population is now
   becoming practically ‘’feeding the cities’’.

   We need to integrate food production into city infrastructure

   The world’s growing population is becoming increasingly urbanised where
   today’s urban population exceeds that of its rural population
   1950 – 29%

   Total population – 2 532 000 000
   1980 – 39%

   Total population – 4 453 000 000
   2010 – 52%

   Total population – 6 896 000 000
   2030 – 60%

   Total population – 8 321 000 000

   With almost 70% of the world expected to live in cities by 2050,
   the strain on the food, energy and water system is increasing at an
   unsustainable rate.

2010

   Extensive research and development is ongoing in Sweden, run by Sweco
   and the Swedish University of Agriculture under the surveillance of
   Plantagon management. Most technical work is focused on how to develop
   smart energy solutions and how to optimize crop volume. Plantagon is
   selected as one out of 50 famous Swedish innovations to represent
   Sweden at the World Expo in Shanghai. Plantagon is offered by the
   Chinese city district Baoshan to build a standalone greenhouse in
   Shanghai. Plantagon turns down the offer. Plantagon teams up with large
   listed companies to expand capacity and know how, such as SAAB
   Technology and Tekniska Verken.
