It's been a while...

   [IMG_8078.jpg]
   Hi there,
   Just reaching out to let everyone know I am alive and well.  I am
   teaching first grade in a new town and I am enjoying a much needed
   summer off after my first year.   I took a year off from social media,
   blogging, and making products for my TpT store.  It was a much needed
   respite from what I affectionately call my side hustle.  Teaching is a
   tough job.  Adding all the extra effort involved with the side hustle
   was more than I could handle last year.  I truly felt like a new
   teacher again in many ways.  It's good for us to get out of our comfort
   zone and try new things...  that was the theme for my year.  I am an
   introvert, so I don't put it all out there on social media.  But, for
   anyone interested, I am going to share some of my story here.
   Things at my old school had been changing over time and for the last
   few years I wasn't feeling supported by administration or my school
   board.  While I truly respect and appreciate all of the members on the
   board of trustees, I could clearly see that they were either unable or
   unwilling to make the changes I was hoping for.  I love my old school
   community soooo much!  But, it was time for a change.  So...  I started
   putting my feelers out there to see if there were any positions
   available that might be a good fit.  I was being very picky and so
   there were only a few school districts I would consider.  I had a few
   interviews, but as of June 2018, nothing had panned out for various
   reasons.   When I left for my super special vacation, I didn't know
   where I would be teaching in the fall.
   To celebrate my 50th birthday and to have the honeymoon my husband and
   I never had,  we took a trip of a lifetime.  (These are the things the
   side hustle makes possible in our lives.)  Here are a few highlights
   from our trip...
   [Amalfi%2Bcoast.jpg]
    Our adventure began on a 7 day Mediterranean cruise starting from
   Rome.  Our first port was on the beautiful Amalfi coast.  Below, Duane
   and I are in the town of Amalfi standing on the top of the stairs to
   the cathedral looking down into the town square.
   [Amalfi.png]
   We sailed around the boot of Italy and visited the very interesting
   medieval town of Kotor,  Montenegro.  The sail into this port was
   absolutely spectacular!
   [Montenegro.jpg]
   Then, we made our way down to the Greek Islands.  I can't say enough
   about how amazing each one was.  These next photos are from Mykonos.
   It's what you think of when you hear "Greek Islands".
   [IMG_0047.jpg]
   [Mykonos.jpg]
   These photos do not really give you the sense of what the islands are
   all about.  We got to go to Corfu, Crete, and Mykonos.  Each island was
   completely different, but had its own charm.  I can't wait to return.
   I highly recommend putting the Greek islands on your bucket list!   Our
   cruise ended in Athens, so we stayed a couple days there to see the
   sights.  This was the view from our hotel room:
   [Acropolis.jpg]
   We were right in the heart of the Plaka district and our view of the
   Acropolis was spectacular.   Athens was wonderful!  After Athens, we
   flew here... (see if you know where we are in this photo).
   [Venice.jpg]
   Hopefully the gondolas on the side were a giveaway...  Venice!  It was
   incredibly special here.  Venice is officially my favorite place to get
   lost in.  Next stop on the Italy train was...
   [Florence-%2Bponte%2Bvechio.jpg]
   [Tuscany.jpg]
   ... Florence and the Tuscany region of Italy!  Truly spectacular :)
   Last stop, ROMA!
   [Pantheon.jpg]
   [Rome%2BSt%2BPeters.jpg]
   So even though this isn't my all time favorite place for gelato in
   Italy, I still had to have the picture...
   [Gelato%2Bin%2BRome.jpg]
   that, and it was right around the corner from our hotel.
   Ok, so... on my last night in Rome, I got a call from a school district
   that I really respected asking me for an interview.  I promised my
   husband it was the last one because I wanted to relax and enjoy
   summer.  I had an interview on July 2 and the rest is history.  Except,
   I moved to my new town because I couldn't do the commute.  It was a
   quality of life decision...  so much for relaxing and enjoying summer.
   I am finally, one year later, feeling mostly moved in and settled.
   This year is a "staycation" summer.
   It has been so good for me to be a learner this past year.  New grade
   level, curriculum, school and district has kept me on my toes.  I have
   a great classroom and an amazing team!  I love my new school community
   and my new town.  I also LOVE teaching first grade!  They are still
   babies, but just enough older to be more independent and capable.
   I will try to stay connected to the teaching community through my blog,
   Pinterest,  and Instagram.   For now, my focus is the much needed self
   care of summer.
   Ahhhhh.... summer :)
   Thanks for stopping by.
   Happy summer everyone!

Maker Space in Kindergarten

   [maker%2Bspace.jpg]
   I created this maker space in my classroom almost two years ago.  I am
   soooooo glad I did.  We use it for really cool STEAM projects.  It
   makes it so easy to do one anytime I want.  It is always there, stocked
   and ready to go.  I originally envisioned this as an independent
   activity in my classroom.  But, the reality of the mess isn't always
   possible during a busy kindergarten day.  So, I use it more often as an
   adult supported activity.  The kids are still working independently,
   but an adult is there to remind kiddos to keep it tidy.  That, and
   having a low heat hot glue gun makes creating so much easier.  The
   adult uses the glue gun, but the students are the design directors.  It
   works perfectly that way.  So, yes, you will need an aide or parent
   volunteer to do this with kinder kids.  In an older grade level, this
   would be easier to manage as an independent center or station.
   Here is how I set it up.  Maker Spaces are as individual as the makers
   who make them.  So, when you set yours up, get some inspiration and
   then do what works for YOU using your available resources.
   [cardboard.jpg]
   I have three big drawers for the kids to pull materials from...  above
   is cardboard.  Below is plastic and paper.
   [plastic.jpg]
   [paper.jpg]
   It is actually easy to fill the space when you get in the habit of
   saving cool recyclables and scraps from other projects in your
   classroom. You can also ask families in your class to donate
   materials.  I use a fourth drawer for storage.  I change up the
   materials in the little bins, so it's nice to have a place to save
   things like corks hardware, twigs, etc.  I like to provide special
   materials that will aide in making each project.
   [maker%2Bspace%2Bbins.jpg]
   Here are just a few of my bins up close...
   [bins%2B1.jpg]
   [bins%2B3.jpg]

   OK, let's move on to some great projects...
   [bridge%2B1.jpg]
   Making bridges is usually one of my first projects of the year.  We do
   it as a part of my Fairy tales/ Folk tales unit.  I use a comprehension
   assessment for The Three Billy Goats Gruff , so we spend some time to
   go in depth with that story.   Creating a bridge makes a great
   extension activity.  Here are few more kindergarten kid designs.  And
   of course we had to get out the plastic goats to test them.
   [bridge%2Btest%2B1.jpg]
   [bridge%2Btest%2B2%2BHazel.jpg]
   Don't you love the "No Crossing" sign?  Written in Kinder writing of
   course!  At the end of that unit, we also make boats for the
   gingerbread man to create a safe way for him to cross the river.  Here
   are a couple of those...
   [boat%2BLily.jpg] [boat%2B2.jpg]
   The tests on the boats are fun, but you have to prepare your kids for
   disappointment.  I read Rosie Revere, Engineer to my class this year
   when we tested our boats.  It was the perfect prime for accepting
   failure as part of the designing, learning, re-designing process.  We
   use the little Pepperidge Farm gingerbread cookies in each boat for the
   test.  So, of course I give a cookie to each of my little makers too!
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1419708457&amp;ServiceVer
   sion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=kind
   ergchroni-20]
   That book cover is an Amazon affiliate link for your convenience.   You
   can grab it by clicking on the image.  It's a must have if you are
   doing STEM projects in your classroom.
   For the boat tests, I use a large plastic storage container that I fill
   with water.  We sit in a circle around it and each child gets to put a
   cookie in their boat and float it (or not) across the water.  It's also
   a great idea to give your kids time to look at each design and talk to
   each other about how it was made.  It's a little makers' convention.
   It only takes about 30 minutes.   I think it is time well spent.
   Here is a precious video of one or our boat tests:

   Here are some adorable kid made leprechaun traps.  This is the original
   STEM project.  I have been doing leprechaun traps in my classroom for
   years.  I like to have the kids make them in the classroom better than
   doing it as an at home project.  The one year I had kids do them at
   home, I could tell that parents helped too much!  You can tell these
   were made by little learners...
   [leprechaun%2Btrap%2B3.jpg]
   [leprechaun%2Btrap%2B2.jpg]
   [leprechaun%2Btrap%2B1.jpg]
   It was great to hear my sweet students explain how each trap was going
   to work.  We usually leave them out around the classroom on March
   16th.  I put some Rolo candies inside each one. (They are chocolate
   caramels wrapped in gold foil).  I also sprinkle a little gold glitter
   around.  It's lots of fun when students come into the classroom on the
   17th and find the GOLD!
   Things can get pretty messy when the kids are working at the Maker
   Space.  Here is the table during leprechaun trap production.
   [Messy%2Btable%2B2.jpg]
   There is a place for everything and we put everything in it's place
   when its time to clean up.  The kids love using the space, so they are
   usually very willing to help clean up.   We have little recycle and
   trash bins in the space so it is easy to put scraps where they belong.
   [recycle%2Btrash%2Bbins.jpg]
   We  also made bird feeders last year  as a spring project.  We had been
   learning about the season of spring and animals that lay eggs,  It was
   a great extension for our unit.  Plus, we have windows in our classroom
   where we can see so many birds outside.  Those little tubs have bird
   seed and Cheerios cereal.  You can also see the big jar of peanut
   butter.  We spread the PB on to the cardboard pieces and then dipped
   them in the seed.
   [bird%2Bfeeders.jpg] [bird%2Bfeeder%2Bfinished.jpg]
   I love this little engineer's design.
   Those are just a few ideas for your little makers.  You don't have to
   have a Maker Space in your classroom to do these projects, it just
   makes it easier for me.  If you haven't already, I hope you will try
   some STEAM projects with your kindergarten class.
   Thanks so much for stopping by.
   Happy teaching!

Maker Space Snowmen

   [snowman%2Bzoey.jpg]
   I wanted my kids to make snowmen this year, but I wanted to change it
   up a little bit.  So, we used our Maker Space to create them.  It was a
   GREAT project.  The kids loved it and we were proud of our results.
   This is the little maker space in my classroom...
   [maker%2Bspace.jpg]
   You can read lots more about how I set it up and get other project
   ideas here:  Maker Space in Kindergarten
   I truly believe that the use of materials and problem solving involved
   during art projects make them sooooo valuable in the young child's
   classroom.  Having all the materials from our Maker Space available for
   these snowmen made them each as unique as the little learners who made
   them.
   Here are some of the materials we used for this project...
   [maker%2Bspace%2Bstuff%2B2.jpg]
   [maker%2Bspace%2Bstuff.jpg]
   Yes, my aide and I both collected little twigs for this project.
   Although in my inspiration examples that I made for the kiddos, I
   didn't use twig arms.  I wanted to give them other ideas in case the
   twigs ran out.  Of course, only two kids ended up using the twigs.  Ha
   ha!
   We also used, foam, felt, paper, beads, pom poms buttons, little
   hardware pieces, bottle caps, pipe cleaners, yarn, cardboard, and
   plastic recyclables.  I gave them very thick white card stock for the
   snowmen bodies.  I was available at the space to help with cutting
   through thick cardboard or craft sticks, and I was also in charge of
   the low heat hot glue gun.  Kids were working independently and were
   the design directors.  They told me where they wanted things, I was
   just gluing.  I try to keep my suggestions to a minimum so that the
   kids are in total creative control.
   Here are a few more adorable snow people...
   [snowman%2BDrake.jpg]
   [snowman%2BWesley.jpg]
   And I just LOVE this adorable snow girl...
   [snowman%2BSadie.jpg]
   We were just finishing up a measurement unit in math, so we also
   measured how many cubes tall our snow people are...
   [measure%2Bsnowman%2B1.png]
   [measure%2Bsnowman%2B2.jpg]
   The kids had a little recording sheet to write how many cubes tall
   their snow person was.   After that, we all worked collaboratively to
   get in order from shortest to tallest .  The kids needed support
   getting in order, so I called out the measurement numbers and kids sat
   down on our big rug in order.  When two students had the same number,
   they had to compare to see which one was slightly taller or shorter.
   It was fun!
   When we had them all in order, we put them on a big table so they were
   ready to go up on a bulletin board.  It looked great!
   [snowmen%2Bby%2Bheight.jpg]
   We were all so proud of our project!  Measuring snowman art with cubes
   is nothing new.   Getting into order by height was a nice addition to
   the activity.  It was a perfect culminating activity to end our
   measurement unit.  It went well with our studies on winter too.
   If you would like to do this activity with your class, you can use my
   little recording sheet if you like it.  It's FREE!  You can download it
   right here:  Snowman Measurement Recording Sheet
   [snowman%2Bmeasure.jpg]
   This is what the page looks like.  It has three recording sheets to a
   page.  Place for students' names and the space for recording the number
   is big enough for little learners.  Hope this helps make winter in your
   classroom a little bit more fun!
   Thanks so much for stopping by...
   Happy teaching!
