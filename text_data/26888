Research Topics

Modeling and Languages Engineering

   Separation of concerns in the development of complex software-intensive
   systems leads to the use of various domain-specific modeling languages
   (DSMLs). SLE addresses the whole life cycle for designing, implementing
   and relating DSMLs to support heterogeneous modeling and analysis.

DevOps for distributed and heterogeneous system

   Flexible yet dependable systems have to cope with heterogeneous
   hardware execution platforms ranging from smart sensors to huge
   computation infrastructures and data centers. We need to devise
   formalisms to reason about the impact of an evolution and about the
   transition from one configuration to another.

Variability Engineering

   The systematic modeling of variability in software systems has emerged
   as an effective approach to document and reason about software
   evolutions and heterogeneity. Variability modeling characterizes an
   “envelope” of possible software variations.

Bell Labs

   The main objectives of the PhD will be to Integrate a chaos engineering
   principles to IoT Services frameworks to improve the robustness of the
   software-defined network services using this approach and to explore
   the concept of equivalence for software-defined network services and
   propose an approach to constantly evolve the attack surface of the
   network services.

Faber Novel PhD grant

   In this project (2018-2021) with the FaberNovel company (ex

GEMOC Initiative

   GEMOC is an open and international initiative that aims to coordinate
   and disseminate the research results regarding the support of the
   coordinated use of various modeling languages that will lead to the
   concept of the globalization of modeling languages.

GLOSE INRIA/SAFRAN Labs 2017-2021

   The GLOSE project develops new techniques for heterogeneous modeling
   and simulation in the context of systems engineering. It aims to
   provide formal and operational tools and methods to formalize the
   behavioral semantics of the various modeling languages used at
   system-level. These semantics will be used to extract behavioral
   language interfaces supporting the definition of coordination patterns.
   These patterns, in turn, can systematically be used to drive the
   coordination of any model conforming to these languages. The project is
   structured according to the following tasks: concurrent xDSML
   engineering, coordination of discrete models, and coordination of
   discrete/continuous models. The project is funded in the context of the
   network DESIR, and supported by the GEMOC initiative.

ICT COST Action MPM4CPS (IC1404) 2014-2018

   Truly complex, designed systems, known as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS),
   are emerging that integrate physical, software, and network aspects. To
   date, no unifying theory nor systematic design methods, techniques and
   tools exist for such systems. Individual (mechanical, electrical,
   network or software) engineering disciplines only offer partial
   solutions. Multi-paradigm Modelling (MPM) proposes to model every part
   and aspect of a system explicitly, at the most appropriate level(s) of
   abstraction, using the most appropriate modelling formalism(s).
   Modelling languages’ engineering, including model transformation, and
   the study of their semantics, are used to realize MPM. MPM is seen as
   an effective answer to the challenges of designing CPS. This COST
   Action promotes the sharing of foundations, techniques and tools, and
   provide educational resources, to both academia and industry. This is
   achieved by bringing together and disseminating knowledge and
   experiments on CPS problems and MPM solutions. Benoit Combemale is a
   member of the management committee.

Inria Associate Teams **ALE**: Agile Language Engineering (2017-2020)

   Software engineering faces new challenges with the advent of modern
   software-intensive systems such as complex critical embedded systems,
   cyber-physical systems and the Internet of things. Application domains
   range from robotics, transportation systems, defense to home
   automation, smart cities, and energy management, among others. Software
   is more and more pervasive, integrated into large and distributed
   systems, and dynamically adaptable in response to a complex and open
   environment. As a major consequence, the engineering of such systems
   involves multiple stakeholders, each with some form of domain-specific
   knowledge, and with an increasingly use of software as an integration
   layer. Hence more and more organizations are adopting Domain Specific
   Languages (DSLs) to allow domain experts to express solutions directly
   in terms of relevant domain concepts. This new trend raises new
   challenges about designing DSLs, evolving a set of DSLs and
   coordinating the use of multiple DSLs for both DSL designers and DSL
   users. ALE will contribute to the field of Software Language
   Engineering, aiming to provide more agility to both language designers
   and language users. The main objective is twofold. First, we aim to
   help language designers to leverage previous DSL implementation efforts
   by reusing and combining existing language modules. Second, we aim to
   provide more flexibility to language users by ensuring interoperability
   between different DSLs and offering live feedback about how the model
   or program behaves while it is being edited (aka. live
   programming/modeling).

Keolis PhD grant

   In this project (2018-2021) with the Keolis company we investigate the
   design of smart city transport simulators that combine top-down
   modelling and IA techniques. In this context, Jean-Marc Jézéquel acts
   as Ph.D advisor for Gauthier Lyan with David Gross-Amblard.

OKWind PhD grant

   In this project with the OKWind company we investigate the design of
   solutions in favor of self-consumption for small industries or city
   districts. In this context, Olivier Barais acts as Ph.D advisor for
   Alexandre Rio with Yoann Maurel.

One Shot Software (OSS) 2017-2019

   The OSS project investigates an extreme version of moving target
   defense where a slightly different version of the application is
   deployed each time it is used (e.g., for crypto functions or payment
   services). We investigate the analysis, synthesis and transformation
   techniques to support diversification at 5 points of a software
   construction pipeline, which, once combined yield up to billions of
   variants. We also evaluate the support of diversification as a first
   class property in DevOps.

Orange PhD grant

   In this project with the Orange company we investigate the security of
   user interfaces. In this context, Olivier Barais acts as Ph.D advisor
   for Youssou Ndaye with Arnaud Blouin.

PROFILE (Cominlabs) 2016-2019

   The PROFILE project brings together experts from law, computer science
   and sociology to address the challenges raised by online profiling,
   following a multidisciplinary approach. More precisely, the project
   will pursue two complementary and mutually informed lines of research:
   (i) Investigate, design, and introduce a new right of opposition into
   the legal framework of data protection to better regulate profiling and
   to modify the behavior of commercial companies towards being more
   respectful of the privacy of their users; (ii)S Provide users with the
   technical means they need to detect stealthy profiling techniques as
   well as to control the extent of the digital traces they routinely
   produce. As a case study, we focus on browser fingerprinting, a new
   profiling technique for targeted advertisement. The project will
   develop a generic framework to reason on the data collected by
   profiling algorithms, to uncover their inner working, and make them
   more accountable to users. PROFILE will also propose an innovative
   protection to mitigate browser fingerprinting, based on the
   collaborative reconfiguration of browsers.

Stamp EU Project

   STAMP stands for Software Testing AMPlification. Leveraging advanced
   research in automatic test generation, STAMP aims at pushing automation

VaryVary ANR JCJC (2017-2021)

   Most modern software systems (operating systems like Linux, Web
   browsers like Firefox or Chrome, video encoders like x264 or ffmpeg,
   servers, mobile applications, etc.) are subject to variation or come in
   many variants. Hundreds of configuration options, features, or plugins
   can be combined, each potentially with distinct functionality and
   effects on execution time, memory footprint, etc. Among configurations,
   some of them are chosen and do not compile, crash at runtime, do not
   pass a test suite, or do not reach a certain performance quality (e.g.,
   energy consumption, security). In this JCJC ANR project, we follow a
   thought-provocative and unexplored direction: We consider that the
   variability boundary of a software system can be specialized and should
   vary when needs be. The goal of this project is to provide theories,
   methods and techniques to make vary variability. Specifically, we
   consider machine learning and software engineering techniques for
   narrowing the space of possible configurations to a good approximation
   of those satisfying the needs of users. Based on an oracle (e.g., a
   runtime test) that tells us whether a given configuration meets the
   requirements (e.g. speed or memory footprint), we leverage machine
   learning to retrofit the acquired constraints into a variability that
   can be used to automatically specialize the configurable system. Based
   on a relative small number of configuration samples, we expect to reach
   high accuracy for many different kinds of oracles and subject systems.
   Our preliminary experiments suggest that varying variability can be
   practically useful and effective. However, much more work is needed to
   investigate sampling, testing, and learning techniques within a variety
   of cases and application scenarios. We plan to further collect large
   experimental data and apply our techniques on popular, open-source,
   configurable software (like Linux, Firefox, ffmpeg, VLC, Apache or
   JHipster) and generators for media content (like videos, models for 3D
   printing, or technical papers written in LaTeX).
