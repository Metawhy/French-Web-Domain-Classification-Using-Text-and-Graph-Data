Dr. Gioia Massa Bio & Briefing

GIOIA MASSA, Plant Scientist, NASA KSC

   Gioia Massa is a NASA scientist at Kennedy Space Center in Florida
   working on food production for the International Space Station (ISS)
   and future exploration endeavors.

   She led the science team for the Veggie hardware validation on ISS and
   she heads an nterdisciplinary group to study fertilizer and light
   impacts on nutrition and flavor of Veggie-grown crops.

   In addition to Veggie she helps with science needs for other space
   station hardware and works with external investigators to get their
   science to function on the station. She also is involved with education
   and outreach programs related to plants in space. Gioia became
   interested in growing plants in space in an agriculture class when she
   was 12 years old.

   She has a BS in Plant Science from Cornell University (with a wonderful
   semester at University of Tasmania in 1994), a PhD in Plant Biology
   from Penn State, and postdoctoral research from Purdue University. Her
   work has spanned the spectrum of plant space biology and
   bioregenerative life support.  Her goal is to give the future residents
   of the habitat of Mars a better quality of life, where they will be
   able to enjoy the sight, smell, taste, and nutrition of green growing
   plants. Her passion is to enable NASA’s grand challenge of space
   colonization as humanity transitions from a planet-bound to a
   spacefaring civilization.
