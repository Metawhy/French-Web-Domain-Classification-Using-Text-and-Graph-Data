   Girl Effect is a creative non-profit – experts in media, mobile, brand
   and international development – working where girls are marginalised
   and vulnerable.

   We build youth brands and mobile platforms that millions of girls and
   boys love and interact with. From apps that build skills, to TV dramas
   that explore vital issues, to magazines written and distributed by
   girls.
