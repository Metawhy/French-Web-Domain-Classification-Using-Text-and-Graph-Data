   Instagram post 2145428447680562890_1029628162 Confession: I inherited
   my LOVE of hoarding tabletop items from my mom!! Her collection of
   amber glass (swipe to see her glasses) inspired this tablescape‚Äôs color
   palette. I purposefully don‚Äôt count how many collections of plates or
   glassware I have (ahem it‚Äôs in the dozens and I have over 70 cake
   stands), but I know that my kids currently love my gig and will enjoy
   the pieces I‚Äôve been collecting down the road (or at least that‚Äôs what
   I tell myself üòÇ).

   local and online vendors! I‚Äôve been OBSESSED recently with amber glass,
   so you will see me use it a few times this season. Tap for resources.
