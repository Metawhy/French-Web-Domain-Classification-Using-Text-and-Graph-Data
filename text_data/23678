   Upload our Confidentiality policy
   This document seeks to inform you of our practices for processing and
   protecting your Personal Data (“Data”), as defined below, obtained from
   the site www.drouotonline.com and www.moniteurlive.com , in strict
   compliance with your rights.

   We encourage you to read all the information we provide carefully and
   to please contact us if you have any questions.
    1. Definitions

   "Data": means any information which, directly or indirectly, enables a
   natural person to be identified by reference to an identification
   number or to one or more elements specific to it. You will never be
   asked to enter so-called “sensitive” personal data, such as your racial
   or ethnic origins, your political, philosophical or religious opinions,
   or information concerning your income or tax situation.
   Your Data are only collected for the strict use and understanding of
   the Platforms as well as the purposes described in Article 4.

   Drouot SI acts as the data controller for your Data that is collected
   during the use of our Services and the Drouot Online and MoniteurLive
   Platforms to provide you with the Services. This means that Drouot SI
   is, in particular, responsible for its collection, security and use for
   the purposes described herein, in compliance with the Data Protection
   rules.

   Drouot does not loan or transfer its customer files to third party
   commercial companies unrelated to the Services as defined herein.

   "Services": Drouot SI provides websites that allow you to:

   - participate remotely by electronic means on the website
   www.drouotonline.com (the “Drouot Online Platform ”) and on
   www.moniteurlive.com ("the MoniteurLive Platform"):
     * in public auctions broadcast live (“Live Sales”),
     * in auctions taking place only on the internet (“Online Sales”);

   The Services are described in the General Terms and Conditions of Use
   of the two Platforms (the “General Terms of Use”).

   "Drouot SI" / "We": the Services are provided by Drouot SI, 9 rue
   Drouot – 75009 Paris, SAS with capital of 50,000 euros registered in
   the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number 790 095 780.

   “User” / “You”: means any natural person using Drouot Online and
   MoniteurLive Platforms.
    2. Consent

   By using our Services and subscribing to  Drouot Online or MoniteurLive
   Platforms, you undertake to provide genuine information about you and
   understand and agree that your Data may be collected, used, stored and
   disclosed to third parties as described below for the purposes of
   providing the Services to which you wish to subscribe.

   The disclosure of false information is contrary to the General Terms
   and Conditions of Use of Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platforms.
    3. Data collected

   We may collect the following categories of Data:

   a. Site Navigation

   Connection data. Every time you log into one of the Drouot Online or
   MoniteurLive Platforms, we passively collect information such as, in
   particular, your computer’s IP address, the date and time of
   connection, together with information about your browser.

   Navigation data. We also collect information to identify how you access
   one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platform, which pages are
   viewed and for how long.

   We may use Cookies as specified below.

b. Creating an Account

   In accordance with the General Terms and Conditions of Use, when you
   create an Account on one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive
   Platform(“Account”), you will be asked to enter a certain amount of
   Data, in particular your first and last names, your postal address,
   your email address, your telephone number, date of birth, etc.

   We also ask that you send us your ID.

   This information is required by sales operators organising auctions, in
   which you register to place Absentee Bids and bid, to comply with the
   legal obligation to formally identify their customers, to which they
   are subject in particular in the context of anti-money laundering.
   Account creation information is also needed to manage the customer
   relationship between Drouot SI and Users and is necessary for the use
   of one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platform.

c. Absentee Bids and online auctions with an Account

   When submitting a Absentee Bid online (“Absentee Bid”) or when you bid
   online, we collect certain information such as the history and details
   of your purchases, the number and amounts of your bids, etc.

d. Bank data

   When you register for a sale on one of the Drouot Online or
   MoniteurLive Platform, your bank details are requested to verify the
   validity of your bank account.

   However, this Data is sent directly to Drouot SI’s payment service
   provider, Ingenico (which is a PCI-DSS-certified company), through its
   own services. We do not hold such Data, we only have a footprint of it.
   Its collection and processing is governed by this company's own terms
   and conditions.

    4. Purposes of collecting your Data

   Your Data are collected to enable us to provide you with the Services
   for one or more of the following purposes:
     * Creation of an account on one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive
       Platform,
     * Enabling you to use one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive

     * Providing you with a history and details of your purchases and the

     * Ensuring the proper execution of transactions initiated by Users
       such as: sales registrations, Absentee Bids, placing bids,
       purchases, payments and deliveries,
     * Offering efficient customer service, particularly in terms of
       helping users of one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platform,
       and complaint management,

       the preferences selected when registering with one of the Drouot
       Online or MoniteurLive Platform from the categories offered, on the
       conditions detailed below (“Newsletter”),
     * When you log in to one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive
       Platform, suggesting items geared to the preferences you set at the
       time of your registration,
     * Compiling sales and traffic statistics for our Services internally,
     * Managing outstanding payments and any disputes sent by sales
       operators regarding the use of our Services,
     * Combating fraud,
     * Managing your requests for the right to access, rectify and object
       to the collection of your Data,
     * Complying with our legal and regulatory obligations.

   entered or if this is optional. If you do not complete these required
   fields, you will not be able to access the Services.

   accessing your personal space from your Account. Your consent is
   obtained by ticking a box.

   You can unsubscribe from Newsletters at any time by accessing your

   the "Profile" section or by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at
   the bottom of the emails received.

   If the unsubscribe link malfunctions, you can unsubscribe by sending a
   message to the following address: info@drouotlive.com.
    5. Recipients of the Data

a. Sales operators

   To find out more, we suggest that you read their privacy policies. You
   will then know how sales operators use your Data when they act as data
   controller for the running of Live Sales and Online Sales, the auction,
   payment and delivery of lots to the successful bidder.

   A sales operator is a natural person or legal entity that arranges
   auctions. It uploads Live Sales or Online Sales on one of the Drouot
   Online or MoniteurLive Platform for use by Users.

   This person can be:
     * A voluntary sales operator carrying out voluntary sales in
       accordance with the regime prescribed by Articles L.321-1 of the
       Commercial Code;
     * A legal Public Auctioneer, public officer and ministerial officer
       responsible for carrying out the appraisal, the valuation and the
       legal sale at public auction of the furniture and chattels governed
       by the laws of 10 July 2000 and 20 July 2011.
     * Any person authorised to hold auctions in any other country and, in
       particular:
     * In Belgium, any person who has requested the presence of a
       ministerial officer to record the sale in the minutes;
     * In Italy, any company registered as such, having obtained a
       commercial sales licence issued by the Chamber of Commerce and a
       public safety licence issued by a special police force;
     * In Germany, the Versteigerer, counterpart of the French voluntary
       auctioneer, who is an independent professional of more than 25
       years who has been judged to be of high moral standing and who has
       obtained administrative authorisation to carry out auctions.

     * To manage your Absentee Bids or your online bids: we share some of
       your information with the sales operators to enable you to make a
       Absentee Bid or bid online on one of the Drouot Online or
       MoniteurLive Platform. The sales operator thus checks your identity
       and meets the legal anti-money laundering obligation to which it is
       subject. Your identity data is then disclosed;

     * We also send your email or telephone number to sales operators so
       that they can contact you if necessary;

     * Sales operators manage the payment of your auction purchases
       themselves. We send them the necessary information, such as the
       amount of your bid and the nature of the lot won;

     * We may only share your Data with sales operators for direct
       marketing purposes with your agreement via a tick box when you
       register for one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platform.
       When you have given us your consent, we undertake to share your
       Data only with sales operators and art professionals who use our
       services.

b. Our service providers

   We share your Data with our own service providers located in the
   European Union, in particular to perform services and actions on
   request and on behalf of Drouot SI, such as checking the validity of
   your telephone number or ID, sending promotional and marketing emails
   or text messages or enabling you to manage your transactions.

   We use and process your login data to identify, delineate and eliminate
   malfunctions and errors in telecommunication systems.

   If the conditions are met, we may use the login data to detect any
   illegal use of telecommunication systems and services.

c. The Drouot Group companies

   As Drouot SI is a subsidiary of the Drouot Group, it will be able to
   communicate your Data to any Drouot Group company in order to inform
   you about the services offered by the Drouot Group companies.

d. The legal authorities

   In accordance with the legal provisions in force, Drouot SI may be
   required to provide information to the competent authorities and courts
   for the purposes of criminal proceedings. Drouot SI may not notify you
   of the disclosure of your Data to authorised third parties.
    6. Data Retention Period

   We retain your Data only for the period necessary for the performance
   of our Services and up to 3 years after the last use of your User
   Account.


   After this 3-year period, Drouot SI may contact you again to invite you
   to log in to your Account within a period of 15 days. In the absence of
   positive and express action on your part, the Account will be
   deactivated and the related data will be deleted or anonymised in
   accordance with the legal provisions in force.

   In the event of a breach of the General Terms and Conditions of Use or
   this Privacy Policy, Drouot SI reserves the right to suspend your
   Account or to deactivate it definitively under the conditions described
   in the General Terms and Conditions of Use.

    7. List of bad payers

   In the event of a payment default by a Bidder at the end of the
   reminder procedure described in Article 12 of the General Terms and
   Conditions of Use, you agree that Drouot SI will keep your Data on a
   blacklist of bad payers for a maximum period of 3 years in order to
   prohibit you from using our Services during this period.

   If you are registered on this list, you will be informed at the time of
   registration.

   If the incident is resolved, your Data will be completely removed from
   the blacklist.

   In the event of a dispute concerning inclusion on such a list, the User
   may contact Drouot SI on the conditions described in Article 11.
    8. Closure of your Account

   If you have created an Account and wish to close it, please write to us
   at the address shown in Article 15.

   Once your request has been received, we will deactivate your Account
   and delete or anonymise your Data within a maximum of two months of
   your request.

   In addition, if your Account is not used for more than 3 years, Drouot
   SI reserves the right to deactivate your Account, subject to sending a
   prior email inviting you to connect to your Account within 15 days. If
   you do not log in, we will deactivate it and delete or anonymise your
   Data which will then be used only for internal statistical purposes.
    9. Security

   We have implemented technical and organisational security measures to
   ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of all of your Data
   to prevent it from being lost, stolen, damaged, distorted or
   distributed to unauthorised persons.

   In addition, you are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of
   the password that allows you to access your Account. Do not share this
   information with anyone. If you share your computer, don’t forget to
   log out before leaving one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive
   Platform.

   We do not have access to your password. We cannot, therefore, send you
   your password if you forget it. However, you can change it at any time
   on one of the Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platform via the password
   reset procedure.

   We store your Data on servers located within the European Union.

   User’s browser loads a given website: the site sends information to the

   11. User’s Rights

   The Data provided are necessary for the performance of the contract for
   the provision of Services to which you have agreed. You may, therefore,
   not withdraw your consent to the processing of Data necessary for the
   performance of the Service, unless you cease using the Services.

   However, you may consult, modify or request the deletion of your Data
   for legitimate reasons at any time using the contact details specified
   in Article 15 below. These requests will be implemented within two
   months of your request. Since 25 May 2018, requests to restrict the

   Drouot SI provides you, free of charge, with information relating to

   if you wish.

   For your security, please understand that in the event of a request for
   information or modification, we need to verify your identity. Your ID
   will not be retained following your request.

   Drouot SI undertakes to notify all recipients of the Data processing of
   your request.
   12. Treatment of data after death

   You have the right to compile guidelines, to which you have
   specifically consented, relating to the retention, erasure and
   disclosure of your Data after your death. You may change or revoke
   these guidelines at any time.

   You may appoint a person to carry out your guidelines. Upon your death,
   Drouot SI will consult the guidelines and request that they be
   implemented. Where you have made no such designation or, unless
   otherwise directed, in the event of the death of the person, your heirs
   have the capacity to read your guidelines and request that Drouot SI
   implements them.

   In the absence of any guidelines or of anything to the contrary in your
   guidelines, your heirs may exercise your rights to the extent necessary
   for the following purposes:
     * Organisation and settlement of your estate. As such, your heirs can
       access the Data processing concerning you in order to identify and
       obtain information useful for the liquidation and sharing of the
       estate. They may also be provided with digital goods or
       familyrelated data that can be passed on to heirs;
     * Drouot SI’s processing of your death. For this purpose, your heirs
       may have your Accounts closed, object to the continued processing
       of Data concerning you or have them updated.

   When requested by your heirs, Drouot SI shall provide evidence, at no
   cost to the applicant, that the transactions required by the heirs have
   been carried out.

   Disagreements between heirs regarding the exercise of these rights will
   be brought before the competent High Court.
   13. Change to the privacy policy

   Drouot SI reserves the right to amend the Privacy Policy at any time,
   and this remains applicable for the entire duration of the use of
   Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platform and Services. In the event of a
   change, Drouot SI will inform you by email.

   If you decline such changes, you agree to cease using the Services.
   Otherwise, your use of the Services is subject to the terms of the new
   version of the Privacy Policy.

   Where you access the Services after being notified by Drouot SI of the
   new version of the Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted this
   new version of the Privacy Policy in full.

   The new version of the Privacy Policy applicable to the Services is
   available on Drouot Online or MoniteurLive Platform. Drouot SI invites
   you to consult this regularly.

   Drouot SI also reserves the right to modify or suspend, without giving
   any reason, all or part of the Services.

   No compensation is payable to you for any modification or deletion of
