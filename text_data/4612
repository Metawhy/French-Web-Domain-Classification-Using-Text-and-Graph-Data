Community Template Gallery For Google Tag Manager - Introduction And Tips For
Use

   October 2, 2019 in Analytics | Comments
   Since the introduction of custom templates in May 2019, the community
   (myself included) has been anxiously waiting for some official solution
   for curating and distributing templates created by the community. Now,
   finally, we have it. It’s called the Community Template Gallery! Read
   Google’s announcement in this blog post. I’m not going to go over the
   basics in this article, since Google’s own documentation stands fine on
   its own feet.

'Still Running' Google Tag Manager Tags – What To Do?

   September 23, 2019 in Analytics | Comments
   Sometimes, in Google Tag Manager’s Debug mode, you’ll see tags appear
   with the status Still Running, and you’ll (eventually) notice that
   these tags are not doing what they are supposed to be doing. When you
   see this message on a tag, it technically means this: The tag failed to
   signal Google Tag Manager that it is “done”. The technical explanation
   is, naturally, too simple to be useful. In this article, I’ll explore
   what “done” means, and how especially Google Analytics tags manifest
   this behavior.

User Distributor Custom Tag Template For Google Tag Manager

   September 20, 2019 in Analytics | Comments
   I’ve enjoyed working with custom templates for Google Tag Manager. A
   lot. So much so that whenever the need to add some custom code to a
   container emerges, my first thought is how to turn that into a custom
   template. Google has been forthcoming in introducing new APIs steadily,
   and I think the variety of things you can do with template is improving
   with every new API release. In this article, I’ll show you how to use a
   simple tag template for distributing your users to groups, based on a
   random split.

#GTMTips: When Click Variables Are Undefined

   September 9, 2019 in GTM Tips | Comments
   A surprisingly common question in forums and communities seems to be
   why the built-in Click variables show up as undefined in Google Tag
   Manager’s Preview mode, even if you click around the site. In this
   article, I’ll walk you through some of the reasons why this might
   happen. Tip 104: What to do when Click variables are undefined Here’s
   the situation: you want to create a Click trigger for your tags, but in
   order to do so, you’d need to see what values the built-in Click
   variables (e.

Enable BigQuery Export For Google Analytics: App + Web Properties

   August 27, 2019 in Analytics | Comments
   Here’s yet another article inspired by the fairly recent release of
   Google Analytics: App + Web properties. This new property type surfaces
   Firebase’s analytics capabilities for websites as well, when before
   they were restricted to mobile apps only (see my guides for iOS and
   Android). Even though the feature set of Google Analytics for Firebase
   is still somewhat bare in the user interface, here’s a perk which might
   push you over the edge and give the new measurement model a shot.

iOS Quickstart With Google Analytics For Firebase And Google Tag Manager

   August 21, 2019 in Analytics | Comments
   A while ago, I published an article on how to build an Android
   application, and bundle it with Firebase. The purpose of that article,
   and the one you are reading now, is to slowly introduce the world of
   mobile app development and Firebase, given the latter is getting more
   and more traction as Google’s go-to analytics platform. After finishing
   work on the Android guide, I immediately started working on its
   counterpart for iOS, and that’s the one you’re reading now.

Android Quickstart With Google Analytics For Firebase And Google Tag Manager

   August 19, 2019 in Analytics | Comments
   With the release of Google Analytics: App + Web, Firebase is suddenly
   all the rage. The new App + Web property can combine data from your
   website and mobile apps, as long as the latter uses Google Analytics
   for Firebase, formerly known as Firebase Analytics. In this guide, I’ll
   walk you through the steps of creating an extremely simple Android
   application, and we’ll then create a Firebase project, and for good
   measure add Google Tag Manager to the mix.

#GTMTips: Get Latest Exchange Rates for Client-Side Conversions

   It’s been a while since I’ve last written a bona fide Google Tag
   Manager trick, so here comes. This was inspired by Bart Gibby’s
   question in Measure Slack. The purpose is to fetch the latest currency
   exchange rates from the exchangeratesapi.io service, cache them using
   sessionStorage, and push the results into dataLayer. From dataLayer,
   they can then be utilized in Custom JavaScript variables and custom
   variable templates to perform client-side conversions. Read More…

Getting Started With Google Analytics: App + Web

   Google recently released a new version of Google Analytics called App +
   Web. Clumsy name aside, this really is for all intents and purposes
   Google Analytics V2 or Firebase Analytics for the Web. We’re not
   talking about a charming way to do roll-up reporting between Google
   Analytics for Firebase and Universal Analytics, nor are we talking
   about an enhancement to Universal Analytics. No, we’re talking about a
   new measurement model for web traffic, which has the convenience of
   being compatible with Google Analytics for Firebase, which you might
   already have running in your apps. Read More…

#GTMTips: Enable Preview Mode in the Safari Browser

   With Intelligent Tracking Prevention, the Safari browser is on a
   crusade against cross-site tracking. One of the most obvious and
   long-standing ways to battle cross-site tracking has been to block
   third-party cookies in the web browser, and this is exactly what Safari
   does by default. However, Google Tag Manager’s Preview mode relies on a
   third-party cookies, so that it can serve you the draft version of the
   container while serving the regular, live container to your site
   visitors. Read More…
