Small Bathroom Remodel

   So...we have the smallest master bathroom on the planet. It's kind of a
   joke that the builders even called it a master bath. It had a pedestal
   sink for criminey's sake! But because it's tucked away where no one but
   us can see or use it, we hadn't touched it since the day we moved in.
   We finally decided to tackle a small bathroom remodel, however, and
   although the footprint hasn't changed, it is so much more functional!
   The best way to show you is probably with a series of before and
   afters. ...

What You Missed

Yarn Nesting Bowl

   Happy Monday, everyone! I’ve got a simple, seasonal craft for you
   today. I was inspired by all the pretty spring displays I’ve been
   seeing on Pinterest and other blogs lately, so I decided to make
   something of my own. Our family room is a work in progress, so our
   mantel has had a hodge podge…

Chocolate-Covered Pretzel Rods for Valentine’s Day

   Hi there! Happy Valentine’s Day! I haven’t been here in awhile, because
   I haven’t made anything in awhile. In the kitchen, or otherwise. But I
   signed up to bring the class treat to my daughter’s Valentine’s Day
   party, so I finally had an excuse to create something! Truth be told, I
   didn’t expect to blog…

Top 10 DIY Posts of 2016

   Hi, there! It’s always kinda fun to look back at the previous year when
   the calendar flips. For one thing, it makes me feel proud of the things
   I was able to accomplish despite having a crazy-busy schedule. Plus, it
   makes me feel resolved (my word of the year!) to continue making
   progress on projects…

My 2017 Word of the Year

   Well, hello! Welcome to Home Made Modern 2017! I like to kick things
   off each New Year with a little re-cap of the prior year and by sharing
   my Word of the Year with you. I’ve been MIA for a month or two. It’s
   the holidays, man. They wipe. Me. Out. Plus, I’m a workin’…

Christmas Pom-Pom Wreath

   Hello, and an almost Merry Christmas to you! I wasn’t sure if I’d have
   the time to pop back on here again, but this one will be a quickie and
   I just had to share how I added some Christmas cheer to our kitchen
   with a pom-pom wreath hung in the window. (Don’t you just…

Cozy Plaid Christmas Centerpiece

   Well, hello there! How are you holding up during the pre-Christmas
   crazy? I haven’t lost it yet, and it almost worries me. Shouldn’t I be
   freaking out? Despite my sage advice about how to prep for Christmas in
   November, we’re not done with shopping, and I haven’t wrapped a thing.
   We’re hosting about 20 people…

A Yellow Door for Christmas

   Hi! Remember how we painted our front door yellow a couple of months
   ago? Truth be told, one of the reasons it took me so long to get it
   done was because I was worried about how a yellow door for Christmas
   would work. (Seems insane, doesn’t it? These are my first-world
   problems.) But ya…
