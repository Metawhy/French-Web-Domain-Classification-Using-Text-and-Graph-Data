Research Interest

     * Distributed and Internet Computing
     * Cluster/Cloud/Fog/Edge Architectures
     * Distributed Operating Systems
     * Distributed File Systems
     * Virtualizations in Distributed Architectures

   My research interests are distributed and Internet computing. More
   precisely I investigate the interest of recent programming models (such
   as event or component programming) in the design of new systems in
   charge of operating large-scale geo-distributed infrastructures. I'm
   currently working on two particular challenges leveraging locality as a
   key point of the design:
     * Regarding Data-sharing, I investigate new layers aiming to (i)
       reduce the impact of the network at WAN level and (ii) to provide
       elasticity capabilities to storage systems.
     * Regarding the management of virtualized infrastructures, we are
       particularly interested by scalability challenges, targeting the
       management of hundred thousands of VMs/containers upon thousands of
       PMs (see Beyond the Clouds).

   My publications since Oct 2008 are listed here (might be outdated)!.

   Short bio: xtreemos.jpg
   I received my Ph.D. from Grenoble Institute of Technologies in
   September 2006 and my M.S. degree from the University of Grenoble in
   2003. During my PhD, I suggested a new way to handle I/O requests in
   multi-application clusters. This proposal led to the aIOLi project, an
   I/O scheduler framework for HPC file systems. In the meantime, I worked
   on the NFSp project, a non intrusive implementation of a parallel NFS
   server. Until these websites will be shutdown, you should find further
   details (Ph D. thesis, publications, code, documentations) on the
   aIOLi's and NFSp's sites.
   Between 2006 and 2008, I held a postdoc position at INRIA in the
   framework of the XtreemOS project EU IP project. During this position,
   I had been in charge of designing and developing kDFS (a kernel
   Distributed File System). I joined the ASCOLA Research Group on
   September 2008 where I worked on distributed cloud computing
   challenges. These activities led in part to the creation of the STACK
   Research Group that has been officially created in November 2017.

   The ASCOLA research group split in two new teams: Gallinette and Stack.
   Gallinette aims at enabling a new generation of proof assistants, with
   the belief that practical experiments must go hand in hand with
   foundational investigations. Stack is interested in delivering
   appropriate system abstractions to operate massively geo-distributed
   ICT infrastructures, from the lowest (system) levels to the highest
   (application development) ones, and addressing crosscutting dimensions
   such as energy or security.

Overview

   Between 2008 and 2017, ASCOLA has been a joint team (a so-called INRIA
   project-team) of the Automation and Computer Science Departement of IMT
   Atlantique and INRIA's research center in Rennes. ASCOLA was also a
   team of Laboratoire des Sciences du numérique de Nantes (LS2N, UMR CNRS
   6004).

   The research team addressed the general problem of evolving software by
   developing concepts, languages, implementations and tools for building
   software architectures based on components and aspects. Its long term
   goal is the development of new abstractions for the programming of
   software architectures, their representation in terms of expressive
   programming languages and their correct and efficient implementation.

   We pursued the following objectives:
     * New concepts and techniques for the compositional definition and
       implementation of complex software systems, notably involving
       crosscutting concerns that cannot be handled modularly using
       traditional software development approaches.

     * New programming techniques and algorithms for resource management
       in mutualized environments. We provide language abstractions and
       implementation techniques for large-scale applications in cloud-
       and grid-based systems, both on the level of (service-based)
       applications and (virtualized) infrastructures. We develop
       solutions, in particular, for the optimization of the energy
       consumption in such environments (data centers …)

     * We developed new formal theories for and apply formal methods to
       the correctness of software systems. We aim at developing more
       powerful techniques for theorem proving and enable complex, often
       dynamic, software systems to be proven correct using program
       transformations and analysis techniques. We develop solutions, in
       particular, for the constructive enforcement of security properties
       on the level of software systems.

   Finally, we applied and validate our results based on real-world
   applications from numerous domains, notably enterprise information
   systems, the Cloud, and pervasive systems.

Selected topics

Coq for Homotopy Type Theory (CoqHoTT)

   The goal of this ERC project is to go further in the correspondence
   between proofs and programs which has allowed in the last 20 years the
   development of useful proof assistants, such as Coq.

Accountability for the Cloud (A4Cloud)

   As part of this EU project, we develop more declarative languages for
   the specification and implementation of accountability properties in
   the Cloud.
