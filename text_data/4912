   Effective: 5/24/2018

   We collect information during and, occasionally, at other times. This
   information, which ranges from limited personal data such as age and
   address to facts about users’ computers, professions and habits, is
   then securely stored on separate servers.

   Le Bernardin, Inc. (or “We”. “Our” or “Us”) takes your privacy very
   seriously. Please carefully read this Privacy Policy and familiarize
   yourself with our privacy practices regarding your personal information
   and how we will use it.  This Privacy Policy applies to the Our site,
   including mobile sites or apps (collectively, the “Sites”). By visiting
   the Sites, you accept this Privacy Policy and Cookie Disclosure Policy,
   which are hereby incorporated. If you do not agree with these policies,
   do not use the Sites.

   What information we collect

   We may collect your personally identifiable information at various
   points throughout the Sites.  You may be asked to provide your name,
   email address, mailing address, phone number, and similar information.

   Uses and Disclosure of Personal Information

   Registration information may be used in several ways:
     * To enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions;
     * To alert you to new projects, Sites features, special events and
       services;
     * To conduct surveys to measure your satisfaction with our service;
     * To enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into
       between you and us;
     * To protect our rights or property or our safety, our members, or
       others;
     * To comply with any court order, legal process, or respond to any
       governmental or regulatory request;
     * To transfer information in the event of a merger, transfer of
       assets or other organizational restructuring;
     * To monitor and evaluate our Sites and identify where we should make
       changes or expand services;
     * To provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual -
       information about our subscriber base and usage patterns;
     * To give our marketing and development staff information that's
       useful for developing new features and services that meet
       subscriber needs;
     * To share data with our affiliated companies for joint marketing and
       other purposes; and
     * To share data with nonaffiliated third parties who provide products
       and services that may be of interest to you.


   We may use third-party service providers or other third-party
   organizations helping to support our mission that may collect, store,
   or process your personal information on our behalf, such as to complete
   your request, e.g. completing a transaction or to outsource one or more
   of the functions described above.

   Subscribers may edit registration information or cancel a subscription
   at any time. We reserve the right to contact any subscriber at any time
   regarding subscription renewals or other subscription-related problems
   or questions as well as changes to our Subscriber Agreement.

   Research

   We may contract with a market-research firm to conduct occasional
   online surveys. When you're within our sites, you may see a pop-up
   window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a
   survey. If you do not wish to participate, simply click the "No, Thank
   You" link and you will not see this window again. If you choose to
   participate, you'll be prompted to answer a series of online questions.
   You will be prompted to enter your e-mail address for validation
   purposes but no other personal information (name, address, etc.) will
   be collected as part of the survey. In some cases, however, you may be
   offered a free gift for your participation. We will need your name and
   address, which will be used exclusively to fulfill your gift request.

   Cookie Technology

   We also employ cookie technology to help subscribers move faster
   through our site. When you use one of our sites, we pass several
   cookies to your computer. A cookie is a string of information that's
   sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your
   computer's memory. This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of
   checking our registration database each time a page is requested. The
   cookie is deleted when a user chooses the log out feature to terminate
   their session. We also employ cookie technology to store subscribers'
   User Names and Passwords. Read our cookie disclosure statement below
   and view a cookie-by-cookie breakdown.

   Some web browsers may transmit “Do Not Track” signals to websites
   visited by the user.  Our information collection and disclosure
   practices will continue to apply as described in this policy,
   regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that are sent by certain
   browsers.

   our Sites. These companies may use information (not including your

LE BERNARDIN COOKIE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

   Last updated: [5/24/2018]

   We employ the use of cookie technology and web beacons throughout our
   site, to allow you to move more quickly and securely through our pages.
   Along with a registration process that uses data encryption, we offer
   consistently secure, efficient online sessions that allow you to
   validate your subscription, access your account and retain some
   personal settings so you can read what you want, the way that you want
   it. And this is all made possible by cookie technology. Below you'll
   find information describing our specific use of cookies, which are an
   inherent part of our production process and have enabled us to better
   serve you.

   What's a cookie?

   A cookie is a small text file that's sent to your computer or other
   device by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a
   site, including information such as your User Name, time of last visit,
   pages viewed, etc. Contrary to what you might read elsewhere, cookies
   cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, destroy
   files, send you viruses, etc. An important point: Cookies can only
   contain as much information as you disclose to the site that sent it to
   you! In our case, that means any information included in your
   subscription form or that you input during the customization of our
   site.

   Why do you use cookies?

   We use cookies for basic reasons: To allow you to move more quickly and
   securely through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using
   several different cookies. When you first enter our site, for example,
   we use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain
   cookies, check our database to verify your subscription and log the
   Internet protocol (IP) that your session originates from. A cookie is
   then temporarily "set" within your browser to allow you to proceed --
   without having to ask you for your User Name and Password with each
   subsequent page you request. Without cookie technology, we wouldn't be
   able to offer you convenient features such as the ability to store your
   User Name and Password and save settings for your customized
   experience.

   So what's in it for me?

   Here's a quick rundown of what we see as the biggest advantages of
   cookies:
     * Faster, more secure access: So we don't have to ask you to identify
       yourself with each new page requested. We can also deliver you
       customized information and store your settings more efficiently.
     * Better information: We want to give you features and services that
       you're interested in. By monitoring popular -- and not-so-popular
       -- features in an aggregate manner, we can better serve your needs.


   So do you track my usage patterns using cookies?

   We track the usage of various features within our sites on an aggregate
   basis and report this to advertisers. However, we do not track your
   usage or other personal information in any individually identified way.

   Some web browsers may transmit “Do Not Track” signals to websites
   visited by the user.  Our information collection and disclosure
   practices will continue to apply as described in this policy,
   regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that are sent by certain
   browsers.

   Will the cookies you send me go away?

   Some of the cookies we use are automatically deleted from your hard
   drive after the end of the browser session (“session cookies”). We also
   use cookies that remain on your hard drive for a certain period of time
   (between one day and thirty days depending on the cookie) after the
   browser session. “Persistent cookies" are stored on your hard drive and
   will be deleted by the browser after the given time.  You are, of
   course, free to clear any and all cookies from your hard drive any time
   you wish. Just search your system for any files named cookie.txt or
   similar and delete them at your discretion.

   So should I surf your site with my browser's cookie-alert feature
   activated?

   We'd recommend that you turn that feature off, perhaps after using the
   site for a day with it on so you can see our cookies firsthand if you
   wish. Our use of cookies ultimately helps you have a better experience
   here. And because we rely on cookies throughout our site, you might
   find it cumbersome to be alerted to each cookie you'll encounter. Many
   of our cookies last only for 12 hours, so you'll see them every day.

   How can I amend my cookie preferences?

   You can configure your browser settings to accept or reject all
   cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies that have
   already been set. Every browser is different, so check the "Help" menu
   of your browser to learn about and to change your cookie preferences.
   You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,
   although you may not be able to use certain features on our site. In
   addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you
   visit web sites anonymously.  The site www.allaboutcookies.org includes
   instructions for managing cookies on many commonly used browses.

   Do you use third party advertising cookies?

   When you visit our site, you may receive cookies that are set by third
   parties. We use third party retargeting and remarketing features on our
   website. These technologies allow us to address internet users who
   previously visited the site by personalized advertising on our
   partners' websites. For this purpose, the retargeting or remarketing
   provider will store a cookie on your hard drive.

   Because cookies do not contain or access any personal information, we
   also allow third parties, like ad networks and servers, to serve
   customized ads to you.  As a result, third parties may access their own
   cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or mobile
   phone. We do not have access to information collected by these third
   parties, nor does this Cookie Disclosure Statement or our Privacy
   Policy govern the use of third party cookies or similar technology.

   If you do not wish to receive these tailored advertisements, you may
   visit the following pages to opt-out:

   Google
   Criteo
   NAI Opt Out Tool

   Do plug-ins on our site store cookies?

   When you access our site, the plug-in provider may store a cookie in
   your browser.  We have no control over the scope of the data collected
   by the provider by means of the plug-in.

   The plug-ins may provide their hosts with information such as the date
   and time of your visit to our websites, your IP address, or the type of
   browser you use. If you are logged on to your account with the plug-in
   provider while visiting our websites and you interact with the plug-ins
   (such as by clicking the corresponding button on our website), the
   provider may match this information and any data you enter.  Your
   recommendations or comments may be displayed as information, together
   with your profile name and photograph, in the relevant provider’s
   service, for instance in search results or in your user profile, or at
   other places on web sites and in advertisements on the internet.

   If you are not a member of the relevant provider’s service, the
   provider may under certain circumstances nevertheless obtain and store
   your IP address.

   For the purpose and scope of the data collection, data processing, and
   use of your data by the provider, as well as your related rights and
   opt-out possibilities, please see the privacy policies of Twitter and
   Google.

   If you are a member of the relevant service and do not wish the service
   provider to collect data on you via our websites and connect them with
   the member data stored by the provider, you have to log off from your
   account with the provider before visiting our internet sites.
