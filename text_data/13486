Why Choose Paradiso

   Last year I went to Paradiso Insurance for an insurance quote. They
   gave me a fantastic price for my house as well as full coverage for two
   vehicles. They saved me over 950 dollars a year. I came back when my
   motorcycle insurance due. Got a good rate then, too. I've since
   recommended two family members who also saved money on their insurance
   needs. Keep up the good work Chris Paradiso.
   Anthony Guardiani
   I challenge anyone to find a more responsive, more caring, more giving
   and more excited insurance company and staff than the company known as
   Paradiso Insurance. Chris Paradiso and his entire team exemplify
   compassion, integrity, loyalty and commitment. They spend more time
   building and promoting others without ever think of themselves.
   Christopher Grant-Connector
   Chris is one of those rare individuals you encounter in life who is
   willing to share his ideas with others in his field. In my 21 years as
   an agency owner, I have never come across an agent that is willing to
   help competitors as willingly as Chris.
   Paul T. Murphy
   Paul Murphy Insurance
   I can't say enough about Paradiso Insurance and its staff! Fast
   service, great quotes, very accommodating and they will bend over
   backwards to make sure you're happy in every respect. They help me with
   our home, auto and business insurance.
   Frankie Z.
   I highly recommend Paradiso Insurance to anyone looking for auto,
   homeowner insurance, etc! Chris Paradiso is amazing and is always on
   the lookout to get his clients the best deals possible on their
   insurance. He has also done a ton of charity work for the Children's
   Hospital and he has done a ton to help our company with our social
   marketing and helping us with our business partners with their
   marketing as well! An all-around amazing company!
   Carolyn D.
   Chris and his team are great. We used them for our business policies
   and they got us a great rate and great coverage.

Connecticut-based Paradiso Financial & Insurance Services knows that at the
heart of The American Dream is the notion that, with hard work, anyone can
improve their lives and those of their children in the greatest country on
earth. As local independent insurance agents and brokers, we are proud to
help neighbors and business associates address the broad range of risks
associated with pursuing such a dream. How do we do this?


     * Through personal insurance, we help families protect the very
       things for which they’ve worked so hard.
     * With commercial insurance, we transfer the risk of property loss
       and liability, so business owners predictably manage their
       operations as they pursue their own dreams.
     * Through life insurance, we reduce the devastating financial impact
       of a loved one’s untimely death.
     * Health insurance we offer brings into control the unpredictable and
       sky-high costs associated with illness and injury.
     * And with solid estate planning, we help individuals reap the
       rewards of their pursuits and enjoy a retirement that’s free of
       financial worry.


   Paradiso Insurance, located at 8 East Main Street in Stafford Springs,
   has one focus: you. You are our boss. And our main goal is to make
   getting the right insurance as easy as possible. We’re well versed in
   the risks and potential losses Connecticut residents and business
   owners face in their personal and business lives, and we work closely
   with dozens and dozens of top-rated insurance companies to give you
   choices—something you won’t get from some of our major competitors.


   Our team members take the time to listen to you and learn about your
   life and property, so we can protect you properly. We carefully review
   your particular exposures with you, and then create a customized
   protection plan that fits your specific business or family needs. We
   explain what coverages we recommend, and then put in place policies
   required to ensure your security.


   Unlike other insurance providers you may have worked with in the past,
   that’s not where the process ends. In fact, we believe it’s just the
   beginning of a long-term relationship! As our customer, we’ll
   communicate with you regularly—however you’d like us to—and we’ll be
   here whenever you have a question or need. You’re our top priority and
   we’ll give you our undivided attention.


   You can feel good about working with Paradiso Insurance. We’re a local
   business and our employees are your neighbors. We understand our region
   and what makes it special because we live and work here. And like many
   of you, we like to shop locally. We’re passionate about supporting our
   community in a number of ways—from our Flag Day flag exchange and
   celebration to other civic events to promoting local businesses and
   helping them to achieve The American Dream—and love being able to make
   our region stronger.


   Whether you’re looking to get insurance for the first time or if you’re
   simply looking to re-evaluate your coverage, the experts at Paradiso
   Insurance are here for you. Give us a call, stop by our Main Street
   office, connect with us on social media or use our quote request form.
   We’re eager to help you protect what’s important to you.

The Paradiso Promise

   Is a 12-point commitment we make to all of our customers and prospects.
   We stand behind this promise. If our team lives up to this promise, or
   if we happen to miss the mark, we want to know!

Promise Three

   We’ll take the time to make sure you understand your options. Insurance
   can be complicated; when you understand what you’re purchasing and what
   the product does, you feel more comfortable selecting insurance options
   with us that fit your business or family needs.
