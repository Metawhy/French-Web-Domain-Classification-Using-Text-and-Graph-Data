Non-Scary Montessori Halloween Printables for Preschool Through Early

   Halloween can have too many frightening images for lots of children. I
   always worked to keep Halloween fun and non-scary. I’m happy to have
   found Montessori printables for preschool through early elementary that
   focus on the fun of Halloween in a non-scary way.

   Disclosure: I’ve been given a copy of the Every Star Is Different
   materials to review. My opinions are honest and my own. This post
   contains affiliate links (at no cost to you).

   I’ve loved all the materials I’ve used from Every Star Is
   Different. The Halloween printables are perfect for classroom or home
   for preschool through early elementary.


   Go through this link to find the individual Montessori-Inspired
   Halloween Printable Packs from Every Star Is Different!

Here are the awesome Halloween materials available from Every Star Is
Different:

   I just started using the Halloween printables yesterday with my
   5½-year-old granddaughter, Zoey, 21-month-old granddaughter, Sophia,
   and 18-month-old grandson, Caleb.

   Below, I’ll show just a few of the activities we used, although many,
   many more are available in the materials from Every Star Is Different!

   Montessori-Inspired Halloween Jack-o-Lantern Printable Pack

   Montessori-Inspired Halloween Jack-o-Lantern Printable Pack from Every
   Star Is Different
     * Teaches emotions using jack-o-lantern faces and compares them with
       children’s expressions
     * Introduces geometric shapes as found on pumpkins during the
       Halloween season
     * Provides a step-by-step guide on how to make a jack-o-lantern with
       true to life images

   Jack-o'-Lantern-Matching

   Jack-o’-Lantern-Matching

   Caleb loves matching all sorts of things, so I gave him some of the
   jack-o’-lantern faces to match. There are many jack-o’-lanterns
   included in the pack, so we can keep adding to the difficulty!
   Identifying Jack-o'-Lantern Emotions

   Identifying Jack-o’-Lantern Emotions

   Sophia is very interested in emotions and will often gently touch the
   picture of a child in a book who’s crying. First, we talked about the
   children’s expressions. Then, we talked about the jack-o’-lantern
   expressions. These images can be used as 3-part cards. But this
   introduction was perfect for a young toddler. Caleb joined us for part
   of the emotions work, too.

   Montessori-Inspired Halloween Animals Printable Pack

   Montessori-Inspired Halloween Jack-o-Lantern Printable Pack from Every
   Star Is Different
     * Introduces children to true to life animals associated with
       Halloween
     * Includes adjective and preposition activities that help enhance
       grammar skills
     * Provides practice with counting, graphs, greater than/less than
       concepts, and more

   Working on "My Book of Halloween Animals" in Cursive

   Working on “My Book of Halloween Animals” in Cursive

   I’ve mentioned in other posts that I’m focusing on cursive with Zoey
   along with her manuscript printing work. I love that “My Book of
   Halloween Animals” is available in a variety of levels of difficulty as
   well as in manuscript or cursive.
   Working with Black Cat Prepositions Picture and Sentence Match-Up

   Working with Black Cat Prepositions Picture and Sentence Match-Up

   Zoey loved looking at all the photos of black cats in the pack. She
   read each of the sentence strips with prepositions and matched the
   strips to the pictures.

   Montessori-Inspired Halloween Language Bundle

   Montessori-Inspired Halloween Language Bundle from Every Star Is
   Different
     * Includes twenty-four (eight of each) beginning, intermediate, and
       advanced words associated with Halloween
     * Features only true to life Halloween concepts and ideas
     * Images and concepts are kid friendly

   Halloween Advanced Language - Green Series Beginner Word Clip Cards
   with Tea Candles

   Halloween Advanced Language – Green Series Beginner Word Clip Cards
   with Tea Candles

   Zoey already reads, but we often reinforce phonograms using the
   Montessori green series. Instead of using clothespins or glass gems to
   mark the Montessori beginning work, I got out our tea candles as
   markers for the Halloween words. Of course, I didn’t leave the candles
   out because of the batteries and toddlers. But it was a fun variation
   on clip cards!

   These Halloween packs are all great for home or classroom use!
