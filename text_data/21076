Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals

   share
   More than 15,000 aborted or miscarried babies were burned as 'clinical
   waste' an investigation has discovered
     * Sarah Knapton

   24 March 2014 • 7:00 AM

   The bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies were
   incinerated as clinical waste, with some even used to heat hospitals,
   an investigation has found.

   Ten NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other
   rubbish while two others used the bodies in ‘waste-to-energy’ plants
   which generate power for heat.

   Last night the Department of Health issued an instant ban on the
   practice which health minister Dr Dan Poulter branded ‘totally
   unacceptable.’

   At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over
   the last two years alone, Channel 4’s Dispatches discovered.

   The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose
   children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and
   were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains

   One of the country’s leading hospitals, Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge,
   incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own ‘waste to
   energy’ plant. The mothers were told the remains had been ‘cremated.’

   Another ‘waste to energy’ facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a
   private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and
   2013.

   They were brought in from another hospital before being burned,
   generating energy for the hospital site. Ipswich Hospital itself
   disposes of remains by cremation.

   “This practice is totally unacceptable,” said Dr Poulter.

   “While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate
   way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue
   Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue
   without delay.”

   Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, has written to all NHS trusts to
   tell them the practice must stop.

   The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has also written to the
   Human Tissue Authority to ask them make sure that guidance is clear.

   And the Care Quality Commission said it would investigate the
   programme's findings.

   Prof Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: “I am
   disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their
   families.

   “This breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use
   services and I’m keen for Dispatches to share their evidence with us.

   “We scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced, if
   required.”

   A total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, while NHS
   figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the UK, or
   11 each day.

   Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal
   remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.

   A spokeswoman said: “The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate
   foetal remains.”

   She added that the trust “takes great care over foetal remains”

   A spokesman for the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
   said that trained health professionals discuss the options with parents
   ‘both verbally and in writing.’

   "The parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of
   foetal remains as for a stillborn child and their personal wishes are
   respected,” they added.

   Self-driving cars will only last four years because they will be used
   so much, a Ford executive has predicted.

   John Rich, operations chief of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, dismissed
   concerns that demand for cars would wane in the future.

   “The thing that worries me least in this world is decreasing demand for
   cars. We will exhaust and crush a car every four years in this
   business,” he told The Telegraph.

   The Detroit-headquartered car maker plans to establish an autonomous
   fleet which will be used as a service by other companies, to be used as
   delivery vehicles or to transport employees.

   Pittsburgh start-up Argo AI, which is developing cars for Ford, is
   currently testing the technology in five cities...

Berlin to impose rent freeze 'so it doesn't end up like London'

   The German finance minister has backed controversial proposals for a
   five-year rent freeze to tackle the rising cost of living in Berlin,
   warning: "We don't want to end up like London”.

   Olaf Scholz, who is also vice-chancellor in Angela Merkel’s coalition
   government, voiced support for plans to block landlords from increasing
   rent on residential properties for five years.

   “If we don't want to end up like London, where even lawyers and doctors
   have to live with flatmates, because they can't afford their own
   apartment, then we have to do something about it,” Mr Scholz told
   Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.

   Berliners have traditionally revelled in the image of their city as
   “poor but sexy”, as it was famously described by a former mayor, but
   that is increasingly at odds with reality.

   Rents have risen rapidly as Germany’s booming economy has attracted
   people from across Europe, and the city has seen protests from locals
   complaining they are being priced out of the market.

   The Berlin regional government is planning to introduce measures next
   week that would freeze residential rents for the next five years,
   making it illegal for landlords to impose increases.

   But the measure has proved controversial, with at least one landlords’
   association advising its members to raise rents  before the new
   measures can be approved.

   The Haus & Grund association advised landlords to increase rents by 15
   per cent — the maximum currently permitted — before June 18.

   Berlin is by no means Germany's most expensive city. Rents still lag
   behind rivals like Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt, but they have been
   rising faster than anywhere else in Germany in recent years.

   A typical one-bedroom flat costs €990 (£880) a month to rent in Berlin,
   compared to £1,550 a month in London, according to European Commission
   figures.

   So far the Berlin authorities have resisted calls for more drastic
   action, including controversial proposals to expropriate flats from the
   city’s largest landlords and use them as council housing.

New underground city planned for Amsterdam

   By Bruno Waterfield

   12:01AM GMT 09 Feb 2008

   AMSTERDAM is to go underground as overcrowding and soaring land prices
   force planners to look beneath the city's famous canals for future
   urban development.

   [news-graphics-2008-_440999a.jpg]

   Dutch engineers have unveiled plans for a £7.4 billion underground city
   providing one million square feet of underground retail, leisure and
   parking facilities.

   "There has always been a lack of space in the city, so what we are
   doing is building a city under the city by using a new construction
   technique, which will not interfere with street traffic," said Moshe
   Zwarts, a partner at the architects Zwarts & Jansma.

   Residents of the historic houses that line Amsterdam's central canals
   have to wait up to seven years for parking permits and a garage space
   can cost as much as £74,000.

   Property prices, once a bargain in the Dutch city that is the cultural
   and commercial capital of the Netherlands, are also soaring. The price
   of an apartment in the De Pijp district which cost £90,000 in 1999, has
   risen nine years later to £223,000 or more.

   The one-way streets, on either side of Amsterdam's waterways, are also
   feeling the strain of overcrowding, and traffic is frequently thrown
   into chaos for hours by delivery vans and rubbish collectors.

   Amsterdam was originally built on drained, swampy marshland and many of
   the classic Dutch gabled houses along its canals are still precariously
   supported by underground wooden beams.

   To find space for new developments, the Dutch engineers have decided it
   is easier to build in the clay under the canals.

   Under the plans, canal water will be temporarily pumped out in order to
   start construction beneath.

   "Amsterdam sits on a 30-metre layer of waterproof clay which will be
   used together with concrete and sand to make new walls," said

   Mr Zwarts.

   "Once we have resealed the canal floor, we will be able to carry on
   working underneath while pouring water back into the canals. It's an
   easy technique and it doesn't create issues with drilling noises on the
   streets."

   Youssef Eddini, a spokesman for the Strukton engineering group that
   will build the underground city, has stressed that the new plan will
   not cause as much disruption as other projects.

   "All materials could be brought to the site by water. We can use the
   canals as a road," he said.

   The project has been approved by Amsterdam's city council. Construction
   work, lasting up to 20 years, is expected to begin in 2018.

   Mr Eddini stressed that the project would pay for itself by creating
   more space for property development, cutting the cost of a new parking
   space to £19,000.

Greece: a nation at war with itself

The attack on an Athens bank that left three dead stirred memories of the
blood-spattered years of Greek civil war in the 1940s. Former correspondent
Harry de Quetteville reports that many fear the violence has yet to run its
course.

   Fire and fury: Athenians gather yesterday outside the bank that was
   torched Photo: Dimitar Dilkoff

   By Harry de Quetteville

   5:12AM BST 07 May 2010

   When 44-year-old Marie-Therese Iatrou, who lives in a comfortable
   suburb outside Athens, spoke this week to her mother, Renna Nezos, she
   detected a note of panic in the 78-year-old's voice.

   "I want to come and live with you outside the city," said Mrs Nezos,
   whose childhood home was occupied by the Nazis and who has vivid
   memories of the bloodshed of the civil war that followed. "I've seen
   this before."

   On the streets outside Mrs Nezos's window in the centre of Athens, tens
   of thousands of demonstrators were preparing to march against the
   extraordinary package of austerity measures imposed alongside the joint
   EU-IMF bailout that has saved the country from immediate bankruptcy.

   To most observers of Greek street politics, there is nothing new, or
   particularly threatening, about the prospect of mass protest in this
   hot-blooded Mediterranean country, politically charged and potentially
   violent though such protest can be.

   As a correspondent based for several years in Athens, I became used to
   the sight of demonstrators parading through the city. Stones are
   routinely hurled; the police routinely respond with tear gas. The
   British and American embassies, regular targets of demonstrators' ire,
   are not built like fortresses for nothing. Protests make for good
   television reports, before everyone forgets about them the
   next day.

   Indeed, the very idea of protestors demanding rights and brandishing
   hammer-and-sickle flags (such as those draped from the Acropolis this
   Tuesday) can seem laughably anachronistic. Tame, almost. For years,
   many of Greece's wealthiest people – those in the northern suburbs of
   Athens with the swimming pools that they are now hiding from the
   taxman; those with the boltholes on Mykonos, built beautifully, but
   illegally, too close to the shoreline – may have regarded the man on
   the street with disdain,
   not fear.

   But on Wednesday that changed. Granted, some amid the crowds venting
   fury about the terms of the bailout were anarchists who sought to sow
   chaos and violent disruption for its own sake. The majority were not.
   Many in the huge crowds were those who felt that they had been cheated
   by the rich. The air was thick with a sense of injustice. And as three
   charred bodies were pulled from a bank that had been torched, the
   spectre of something altogether more sinister than just the usual run
   of riots hovered over Greece – class war.

   It is to be hoped that the deaths have some positive legacy. They have
   shocked many. Even anarchists happy to dispatch a bank branch with a
   Molotov cocktail will pause at the prospect of body bags.

   But as the demonstrators chanted "Thieves, thieves" on Wednesday, there
   will have been many in Greek society who know that the cry is addressed
   to them: industrialists; politicians; even parts of the Orthodox Church
   that plays such a huge part in Greek life – all stand accused of
   milking the rest of society.

   In the worst-case scenario, it may be payback time. Poor against rich.
   Masses against elite. There are plenty who feel they have little, on
   earnings of just a few hundred euros a month, to lose.

   Will the crowds limit themselves to slogans draped across the Acropolis
   in future? Or will demonstrators who are usually dismissed as relics of
   the past actually storm the bastions of privilege that surround them
   today? It may seem unlikely to far-off observers, but not so to those
   of a certain vintage in Greece, particularly those who lived through
   the 1946-49 war that pitted Greece's communists against the US and
   UK-backed Right.

   "Everyone from my mother's generation who lived through the civil war
   is worried," says Ms Iatrou. "It was a very bloody conflict. And the
   Communist Party is still a powerful force here. My mother is coming to
   stay with us because she is sure it's going to happen again.

   "For people of my generation, that sounds excessive, but my mother just
   says, 'You don't know, you didn't live through it'. My aunt told me
   that
   about the civil war – about how
   friendly neighbours could change overnight and become enemies. It was
   brutal."

   In the darkest days of the civil war, Mrs Nezos, then a teenager, was
   forced to live off scraps for weeks. It is no surprise that she is now
   telling her daughter to stock up on supplies.

   Only a few years ago, as Greece beggared itself to build the venues for
   the Olympic Games of 2004, the prospect of pitchfork-wielding mobs
   rampaging through the feted streets of antiquity seemed ludicrous. But
   even then, the seeds of Greece's current crisis were there for all to
   see. Not in the vast sums that the country spent, and could ill-afford
   to spend, on the Games (although such profligacy hardly helped), but in
   the fact that everyone knew that Greece was beggaring itself. There was
   no attempt to conceal the disorganisation, and the overspending that
   resulted.

   In its determination to host the Games, the nation agreed to avert its
   eyes from the realities of the situation. It was a conspiracy of
   silence among an entire population. Eleven million people knew exactly
   what was happening. They simply chose not to talk about it.

   And the same is true today. Those tens of thousands ripping up Athens
   may be calling for heads to roll and venting what seems to be a
   bottomless supply of fury at their politicians, but the truth is that
   the vast majority of them are certain to have conspired, at some level,
   with the system of deceit and corruption that has now brought Greece to
   its knees.

   Tax avoidance is the obvious issue but it is only the tip of the
   iceberg, only the most obvious symptom of a disease that runs
   throughout Greek society. The demonstrators may claim that it is not
   they but the rich who are corrupt, who have thrived on dodgy business
   deals, who have bribed officials to circumvent every law in the statute
   book.

   But the truth is that petty corruption is just as rife. Everyone from
   doctors to taxi drivers cooks their books. Innumerable buildings have
   steel girders protruding up from what appears to be the roof. Otherwise
   the structures are complete and inhabited, but if the girders remain in
   place, the building is deemed unfinished and therefore not liable to
   the taxman.

   This is a close society where favours, friends and connections matter.
   Patronage is the rule, not the exception. But the hypocrisy of Greek
   demonstrators is that this is a two-way system. They may be outraged at
   the politicians who have run for office in return for offers of cosy
   jobs in the civil service, but huge numbers have accepted those jobs.

   Rather than reject the grey economy of everyday bribes and backhanders,
   Greeks have learned to live with the system. Who can blame them? It has
   been too pervasive to avoid.

   There have been particularly egregious offenders, and it would
   certainly calm the situation if a propitious sacrifice were made and
   some high-profile figures were carted off to jail. But the reality is
   that the guilt in Greece is collective. Everyone has been corrupt,
   everyone is to blame.

   In this apparently gloomy conclusion, however, lies the key to Greece's
   redemption. Deep down, most Greeks accept that it is not just the
   politicians who have sinned. They, too, are to blame and must now
   repent.

   "The majority of Greeks are clear that things will have to change,"
   says Ms Iatrou. "They understand that everyone will have to pay, that
   Greece will just have to grow up."

   In adversity, a nation draws together. Instead of heading to the
   precipice of division and civil conflict, Greeks must know that they
   have a common enemy and must fight together. Yet many also acknowledge
   that their first loyalties are not to the common good, but to
   themselves and their families.

   That may be about to change for the better. Yesterday the Greek
   government said it would press ahead with austerity reforms despite
   their deep unpopularity. "We know the political cost is very high but
   we accept this in full conscience," said finance minister George
   Papaconstantinou.

   And if Greece's politicians – long derided, now despised – can suddenly
   find it within themselves to do the right thing, surely it is not
   beyond the Greek people?

Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals

   share
   More than 15,000 aborted or miscarried babies were burned as 'clinical
   waste' an investigation has discovered
     * Sarah Knapton

   24 March 2014 • 7:00 AM

   The bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies were
   incinerated as clinical waste, with some even used to heat hospitals,
   an investigation has found.

   Ten NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other
   rubbish while two others used the bodies in ‘waste-to-energy’ plants
   which generate power for heat.

   Last night the Department of Health issued an instant ban on the
   practice which health minister Dr Dan Poulter branded ‘totally
   unacceptable.’

   At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over
   the last two years alone, Channel 4’s Dispatches discovered.

   The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose
   children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and
   were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains

   One of the country’s leading hospitals, Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge,
   incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own ‘waste to
   energy’ plant. The mothers were told the remains had been ‘cremated.’

   Another ‘waste to energy’ facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a
   private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and
   2013.

   They were brought in from another hospital before being burned,
   generating energy for the hospital site. Ipswich Hospital itself
   disposes of remains by cremation.

   “This practice is totally unacceptable,” said Dr Poulter.

   “While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate
   way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue
   Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue
   without delay.”

   Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, has written to all NHS trusts to
   tell them the practice must stop.

   The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has also written to the
   Human Tissue Authority to ask them make sure that guidance is clear.

   And the Care Quality Commission said it would investigate the
   programme's findings.

   Prof Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: “I am
   disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their
   families.

   “This breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use
   services and I’m keen for Dispatches to share their evidence with us.

   “We scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced, if
   required.”

   A total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, while NHS
   figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the UK, or
   11 each day.

   Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal
   remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.

   A spokeswoman said: “The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate
   foetal remains.”

   She added that the trust “takes great care over foetal remains”

   A spokesman for the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
   said that trained health professionals discuss the options with parents
   ‘both verbally and in writing.’

   "The parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of
   foetal remains as for a stillborn child and their personal wishes are
   respected,” they added.

   Self-driving cars will only last four years because they will be used
   so much, a Ford executive has predicted.

   John Rich, operations chief of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, dismissed
   concerns that demand for cars would wane in the future.

   “The thing that worries me least in this world is decreasing demand for
   cars. We will exhaust and crush a car every four years in this
   business,” he told The Telegraph.

   The Detroit-headquartered car maker plans to establish an autonomous
   fleet which will be used as a service by other companies, to be used as
   delivery vehicles or to transport employees.

   Pittsburgh start-up Argo AI, which is developing cars for Ford, is
   currently testing the technology in five cities...

Berlin to impose rent freeze 'so it doesn't end up like London'

   The German finance minister has backed controversial proposals for a
   five-year rent freeze to tackle the rising cost of living in Berlin,
   warning: "We don't want to end up like London”.

   Olaf Scholz, who is also vice-chancellor in Angela Merkel’s coalition
   government, voiced support for plans to block landlords from increasing
   rent on residential properties for five years.

   “If we don't want to end up like London, where even lawyers and doctors
   have to live with flatmates, because they can't afford their own
   apartment, then we have to do something about it,” Mr Scholz told
   Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.

   Berliners have traditionally revelled in the image of their city as
   “poor but sexy”, as it was famously described by a former mayor, but
   that is increasingly at odds with reality.

   Rents have risen rapidly as Germany’s booming economy has attracted
   people from across Europe, and the city has seen protests from locals
   complaining they are being priced out of the market.

   The Berlin regional government is planning to introduce measures next
   week that would freeze residential rents for the next five years,
   making it illegal for landlords to impose increases.

   But the measure has proved controversial, with at least one landlords’
   association advising its members to raise rents  before the new
   measures can be approved.

   The Haus & Grund association advised landlords to increase rents by 15
   per cent — the maximum currently permitted — before June 18.

   Berlin is by no means Germany's most expensive city. Rents still lag
   behind rivals like Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt, but they have been
   rising faster than anywhere else in Germany in recent years.

   A typical one-bedroom flat costs €990 (£880) a month to rent in Berlin,
   compared to £1,550 a month in London, according to European Commission
   figures.

   So far the Berlin authorities have resisted calls for more drastic
   action, including controversial proposals to expropriate flats from the
   city’s largest landlords and use them as council housing.

New underground city planned for Amsterdam

   By Bruno Waterfield

   12:01AM GMT 09 Feb 2008

   AMSTERDAM is to go underground as overcrowding and soaring land prices
   force planners to look beneath the city's famous canals for future
   urban development.

   [news-graphics-2008-_440999a.jpg]

   Dutch engineers have unveiled plans for a £7.4 billion underground city
   providing one million square feet of underground retail, leisure and
   parking facilities.

   "There has always been a lack of space in the city, so what we are
   doing is building a city under the city by using a new construction
   technique, which will not interfere with street traffic," said Moshe
   Zwarts, a partner at the architects Zwarts & Jansma.

   Residents of the historic houses that line Amsterdam's central canals
   have to wait up to seven years for parking permits and a garage space
   can cost as much as £74,000.

   Property prices, once a bargain in the Dutch city that is the cultural
   and commercial capital of the Netherlands, are also soaring. The price
   of an apartment in the De Pijp district which cost £90,000 in 1999, has
   risen nine years later to £223,000 or more.

   The one-way streets, on either side of Amsterdam's waterways, are also
   feeling the strain of overcrowding, and traffic is frequently thrown
   into chaos for hours by delivery vans and rubbish collectors.

   Amsterdam was originally built on drained, swampy marshland and many of
   the classic Dutch gabled houses along its canals are still precariously
   supported by underground wooden beams.

   To find space for new developments, the Dutch engineers have decided it
   is easier to build in the clay under the canals.

   Under the plans, canal water will be temporarily pumped out in order to
   start construction beneath.

   "Amsterdam sits on a 30-metre layer of waterproof clay which will be
   used together with concrete and sand to make new walls," said

   Mr Zwarts.

   "Once we have resealed the canal floor, we will be able to carry on
   working underneath while pouring water back into the canals. It's an
   easy technique and it doesn't create issues with drilling noises on the
   streets."

   Youssef Eddini, a spokesman for the Strukton engineering group that
   will build the underground city, has stressed that the new plan will
   not cause as much disruption as other projects.

   "All materials could be brought to the site by water. We can use the
   canals as a road," he said.

   The project has been approved by Amsterdam's city council. Construction
   work, lasting up to 20 years, is expected to begin in 2018.

   Mr Eddini stressed that the project would pay for itself by creating
   more space for property development, cutting the cost of a new parking
   space to £19,000.

Greece: a nation at war with itself

The attack on an Athens bank that left three dead stirred memories of the
blood-spattered years of Greek civil war in the 1940s. Former correspondent
Harry de Quetteville reports that many fear the violence has yet to run its
course.

   Fire and fury: Athenians gather yesterday outside the bank that was
   torched Photo: Dimitar Dilkoff

   By Harry de Quetteville

   5:12AM BST 07 May 2010

   When 44-year-old Marie-Therese Iatrou, who lives in a comfortable
   suburb outside Athens, spoke this week to her mother, Renna Nezos, she
   detected a note of panic in the 78-year-old's voice.

   "I want to come and live with you outside the city," said Mrs Nezos,
   whose childhood home was occupied by the Nazis and who has vivid
   memories of the bloodshed of the civil war that followed. "I've seen
   this before."

   On the streets outside Mrs Nezos's window in the centre of Athens, tens
   of thousands of demonstrators were preparing to march against the
   extraordinary package of austerity measures imposed alongside the joint
   EU-IMF bailout that has saved the country from immediate bankruptcy.

   To most observers of Greek street politics, there is nothing new, or
   particularly threatening, about the prospect of mass protest in this
   hot-blooded Mediterranean country, politically charged and potentially
   violent though such protest can be.

   As a correspondent based for several years in Athens, I became used to
   the sight of demonstrators parading through the city. Stones are
   routinely hurled; the police routinely respond with tear gas. The
   British and American embassies, regular targets of demonstrators' ire,
   are not built like fortresses for nothing. Protests make for good
   television reports, before everyone forgets about them the
   next day.

   Indeed, the very idea of protestors demanding rights and brandishing
   hammer-and-sickle flags (such as those draped from the Acropolis this
   Tuesday) can seem laughably anachronistic. Tame, almost. For years,
   many of Greece's wealthiest people – those in the northern suburbs of
   Athens with the swimming pools that they are now hiding from the
   taxman; those with the boltholes on Mykonos, built beautifully, but
   illegally, too close to the shoreline – may have regarded the man on
   the street with disdain,
   not fear.

   But on Wednesday that changed. Granted, some amid the crowds venting
   fury about the terms of the bailout were anarchists who sought to sow
   chaos and violent disruption for its own sake. The majority were not.
   Many in the huge crowds were those who felt that they had been cheated
   by the rich. The air was thick with a sense of injustice. And as three
   charred bodies were pulled from a bank that had been torched, the
   spectre of something altogether more sinister than just the usual run
   of riots hovered over Greece – class war.

   It is to be hoped that the deaths have some positive legacy. They have
   shocked many. Even anarchists happy to dispatch a bank branch with a
   Molotov cocktail will pause at the prospect of body bags.

   But as the demonstrators chanted "Thieves, thieves" on Wednesday, there
   will have been many in Greek society who know that the cry is addressed
   to them: industrialists; politicians; even parts of the Orthodox Church
   that plays such a huge part in Greek life – all stand accused of
   milking the rest of society.

   In the worst-case scenario, it may be payback time. Poor against rich.
   Masses against elite. There are plenty who feel they have little, on
   earnings of just a few hundred euros a month, to lose.

   Will the crowds limit themselves to slogans draped across the Acropolis
   in future? Or will demonstrators who are usually dismissed as relics of
   the past actually storm the bastions of privilege that surround them
   today? It may seem unlikely to far-off observers, but not so to those
   of a certain vintage in Greece, particularly those who lived through
   the 1946-49 war that pitted Greece's communists against the US and
   UK-backed Right.

   "Everyone from my mother's generation who lived through the civil war
   is worried," says Ms Iatrou. "It was a very bloody conflict. And the
   Communist Party is still a powerful force here. My mother is coming to
   stay with us because she is sure it's going to happen again.

   "For people of my generation, that sounds excessive, but my mother just
   says, 'You don't know, you didn't live through it'. My aunt told me
   that
   about the civil war – about how
   friendly neighbours could change overnight and become enemies. It was
   brutal."

   In the darkest days of the civil war, Mrs Nezos, then a teenager, was
   forced to live off scraps for weeks. It is no surprise that she is now
   telling her daughter to stock up on supplies.

   Only a few years ago, as Greece beggared itself to build the venues for
   the Olympic Games of 2004, the prospect of pitchfork-wielding mobs
   rampaging through the feted streets of antiquity seemed ludicrous. But
   even then, the seeds of Greece's current crisis were there for all to
   see. Not in the vast sums that the country spent, and could ill-afford
   to spend, on the Games (although such profligacy hardly helped), but in
   the fact that everyone knew that Greece was beggaring itself. There was
   no attempt to conceal the disorganisation, and the overspending that
   resulted.

   In its determination to host the Games, the nation agreed to avert its
   eyes from the realities of the situation. It was a conspiracy of
   silence among an entire population. Eleven million people knew exactly
   what was happening. They simply chose not to talk about it.

   And the same is true today. Those tens of thousands ripping up Athens
   may be calling for heads to roll and venting what seems to be a
   bottomless supply of fury at their politicians, but the truth is that
   the vast majority of them are certain to have conspired, at some level,
   with the system of deceit and corruption that has now brought Greece to
   its knees.

   Tax avoidance is the obvious issue but it is only the tip of the
   iceberg, only the most obvious symptom of a disease that runs
   throughout Greek society. The demonstrators may claim that it is not
   they but the rich who are corrupt, who have thrived on dodgy business
   deals, who have bribed officials to circumvent every law in the statute
   book.

   But the truth is that petty corruption is just as rife. Everyone from
   doctors to taxi drivers cooks their books. Innumerable buildings have
   steel girders protruding up from what appears to be the roof. Otherwise
   the structures are complete and inhabited, but if the girders remain in
   place, the building is deemed unfinished and therefore not liable to
   the taxman.

   This is a close society where favours, friends and connections matter.
   Patronage is the rule, not the exception. But the hypocrisy of Greek
   demonstrators is that this is a two-way system. They may be outraged at
   the politicians who have run for office in return for offers of cosy
   jobs in the civil service, but huge numbers have accepted those jobs.

   Rather than reject the grey economy of everyday bribes and backhanders,
   Greeks have learned to live with the system. Who can blame them? It has
   been too pervasive to avoid.

   There have been particularly egregious offenders, and it would
   certainly calm the situation if a propitious sacrifice were made and
   some high-profile figures were carted off to jail. But the reality is
   that the guilt in Greece is collective. Everyone has been corrupt,
   everyone is to blame.

   In this apparently gloomy conclusion, however, lies the key to Greece's
   redemption. Deep down, most Greeks accept that it is not just the
   politicians who have sinned. They, too, are to blame and must now
   repent.

   "The majority of Greeks are clear that things will have to change,"
   says Ms Iatrou. "They understand that everyone will have to pay, that
   Greece will just have to grow up."

   In adversity, a nation draws together. Instead of heading to the
   precipice of division and civil conflict, Greeks must know that they
   have a common enemy and must fight together. Yet many also acknowledge
   that their first loyalties are not to the common good, but to
   themselves and their families.

   That may be about to change for the better. Yesterday the Greek
   government said it would press ahead with austerity reforms despite
   their deep unpopularity. "We know the political cost is very high but
   we accept this in full conscience," said finance minister George
   Papaconstantinou.

   And if Greece's politicians – long derided, now despised – can suddenly
   find it within themselves to do the right thing, surely it is not
   beyond the Greek people?

   Do you remember that photo of Princess Diana, arms aloft and expression
   joyful, winning the mums’ race at William’s prep school? When you’ve
   finished wondering whether the other mothers let her win, the most
   striking thing is how inappropriately dressed they all are. Skirts
   billow above Sloaney mum-pumps and hair flows beneath velvet Alice
   bands.

   Today, they’d be fully clad in sweat-wicking running tights and
   clutching protein shakes. As Britain’s population become more obese,
   children’s sports days have become increasingly competitive as if
   athletic prowess were a signifier of moral superiority and good
   parenting.

   This is further fuelled by social media which is filled with #dadsrace
   and photos of the spoils of glory (stickers, certificates and medals).
   Twitter and Instagram are stuffed full of humblebrags and just plain
   brags as they flock to inform the world they’ve still got it. ‘Dads’
   race champ 3 years in a row,’ reads one typical example.

   PARENTS RACES- SCHOOL SPORTS DAY
   Credit: Philip Hollis/TMG

   Osteopaths and physiotherapists report an upsurge of business at this
   time of year with hamstring strains and lower back injuries being top
   of the list of ailments. My husband runs the dads’ five-a-side football
   for our kids’ primary and every week another one ends up in A&E with a
   poignant physical embodiment of the gap between hope and experience.

   One osteopath even gives out a list of top tips including proper
   warm-ups and eschewing of flipflops. What they don’t advise, and
   should, is that a crucial part of preparation is to know your
   opposition, which will likely fall into one of the following
   categories.

1. The Former Athlete

   This is particularly prevalent in prep schools in South West London and
   in Alderley Edge near Manchester, where there’s an abundance of
   footballers and other sportsmen who’ve been successful enough to afford
   the exorbitant fees. One father I know, who has long hung up his
   running shoes, still remembers the look of fearsome determination on
   former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio’s face as they lined up
   for the 100m. The flanker won, needless to say.

   It’s not all bad news for the less alpha. A friend told me that David
   Beckham deliberately and nonchalently threw the dads’ race at his boys’
   prep school. Forget all the work for Unicef, Becks deserves a
   knighthood for this piece of altruism alone. There are middle-aged
   bankers across West London who will be dining out on protein shakes for
   the rest of the lives thanks to this.

2. The Lycra Imposter

   Some mothers dress for the school run as if it were the school marathon
   with head-to-toe Lululemon, Nike and Sweaty Betty. It’s easy to assume
   that they’ll be demons on the track, but it turns out that they’re
   putting the leisure into the term athleisure. If you’ve ever seen the
   very funny Skit Box viral video mocking women who wear activewear for
   not-active things (‘doing literally nothing in my activewear’), you’ll
   know the type. She loves the bum-enhancing properties of yoga pants far
   more than actually doing the downward dog.

3. The Serious Trainer

   One poster on social media, with no apparent irony, wrote this week:
   ‘hard couple of weeks, sprint training, fartlek, circuits and long
   endurance runs but today I bore the fruits of my labours and smashed
   it’. For these mums and dads, it’s the winning not the taking part and
   they’ll leave nothing to chance.

4. The Too-Cool-for-School Sports Day

   He’s young, he’s bearded and he’s wearing trainers – he should be good.
   But no, it turns out his feet are shod in an import-only drop from
   indie Japanese brand Terrem that has nothing to do with sport and
   everything to do with his hipster pride. If your Scandi Axel Arigatos
   cost £150 and you got them via a waiting list, the last thing you’ll
   want to do in them is sprint.

5. The Young-Enough-To-Be-Your-Son/Daughter one

   My children’s primary allegedly has the most economically mixed
   catchment area in Britain. This makes for a heartening mix of
   ethnicities, dress codes, backgrounds and ages. Heartening, that is,
   until sports day when for all my moisturising and Barry’s Boot Camp,
   there’s no disguising that there are grandparents younger than me. Just
   because I know some Stormzy lyrics, doesn’t mean I can outrun the woman
   who went to school with him.

6. The Vicarious Competitor

   ‘If you can beat them, make sure your child can’ is the motto of this
   parent. They stand at the side with their stop watches and energy gels,
   shouting encouragement/abuse at their offspring, exhorting them to
   crush the opposition (which consists of a crying five-year-old). One
   Sunday recently we bumped into a dad who was on his bike with his two
   kids running beside him, trainer-from-Rocky style, as he shouted at
   them to lift their knees up.

7 The Vocalizer

   Closely related (often by marriage) to the Vicarious Competitor, this
   one won’t run but boy will she shout. If there were Olympic medals for
   hollering, she’d get gold. Sometimes the screeching is so intense, one
   wonders whether she might in fact be drunk, despite it being 10 in the
   morning, an impression not hindered by the occasionally fruity
   language. It’s like that scene in My Fair Lady when Audrey Hepburn’s
   Eliza screams ‘Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin’ arse’ except without
   the splendid costumes and parasol.

8 The Very Important Career Person

   ‘I’m at my son’s sports day,’ this one booms into his or her mobile,
   the device they’re surgically attached to for the duration. ‘Can’t talk
   long,’ they say as they proceed to do just that, using the words
   synergy and optimisation a lot. Even when not talking, their eyes are
   glued to the screen as little Felix throws a bean bag at their head to
   try to get some attention. To no avail.

Ipswich sweep back to Europe

   Europe bound: Alun Armstrong runs to congratulate Jermaine Wright on
   sealing another Ipswich victory

   By Patrick Barclay at Portman Road

   7:50PM BST 21 Apr 2001

   Ipswich (1) 2 Coventry (0) 0

   TWENTY YEARS after Ipswich won the UEFA Cup, the splendidly run Suffolk
   club celebrated qualification for next season's competition with this
   victory, which restored Coventry's less desirable status as clear
   relegation favourites.

   [sport-graphics-2001_985658a.jpg]

   But Ipswich may have a bigger fish to fry. Indeed they may shortly be
   afforded the luxury of waiving their prize in order to participate in
   the Champions League. George Burley's team are still three points ahead
   of Leeds, who have a match in hand but a slightly inferior goal
   difference.

   Chelsea's challenge faded significantly, leaving Liverpool the only
   other realistic contenders for third place (on the assumption Arsenal
   finish second) and over Liverpool, who face Tottenham today in the
   first of their matches in hand, Ipswich have the considerable advantage
   of breathing space; with nearly a month of the season left, Burley's
   men face just three matches - Manchester City at home and Charlton and
   Derby away - compared with the eight awaiting Gerard Houllier's.

       21 Apr 2001

   Coventry, who play host to Liverpool next Saturday, could have no
   complaint at losing here, even if after a one-sided first half, during
   which Martijn Reuser put Ipswich in front, they rallied and were
   striving for an equaliser when Jermaine Wright scored. The 34 minutes
   left contained nothing in the nature of a contest, Ipswich knowing that
   their seventh win in nine matches would carry them back into Europe
   less than a year after promotion.

   Richard Wright, their fledgling international goalkeeper, missed it. He
   suffered a back injury in the warm-up and was hastily replaced by Keith
   Branagan, the burly 34-year-old making his third appearance since
   arriving at Portman Road on a free transfer from Bolton a year ago.

   Branagan was in action before long, diving to tame a low ball from
   Marcus Hall. This initial flurry, however, was all Coventry could
   manage as Ipswich took control, sweeping smoothly across the full width
   of the pitch as ever.

   So it was no surprise when Ipswich moved in front. The details were
   interesting, for Burley seems to encourage his strikers to drop deep
   and create and thus Alun Armstrong popped up to feed Wright, who timed
   his advance nicely, beat Hall and crossed; in the goalmouth Matt
   Holland and Barry Quinn distracted each other, letting the ball through
   to Reuser, whose firm shot went through the inevitably large gap
   between Chris Kirkland and the far post.

   All the while Branagan was little more than a spectator. The bulk of
   play remained in Coventry's half, where Marcus Stewart now displayed a
   catholic approach to the striker's role, roaming to win the ball and
   find Reuser so that Hermann Hreidarsson, overlapping with
   characteristic enthusiasm, could pick out the eager head of Armstrong
   at the near post; the trajectory asked too much, though, Armstrong
   failing to screw the ball back over his shoulder sharply enough to
   exercise Kirkland.

   Coventry had won three of their previous four matches and been far from
   disgraced - at Old Trafford - in the other, yet here they were being
   obliged to chase most of the time as Ipswich's neat, tutored football
   made excellent use of an admirable pitch.

   Before the match Gordon Strachan had said of his team's improved
   fortunes: "The football's no different. All that's happened is that
   we've started scoring goals." They could hardly do so without making
   chances and after the interval we looked for a sign of revival, a hint
   that the vigour of John Hartson, whom Ipswich had isolated, could be
   brought to bear.

   It soon was - but not effectively, because the challenge that briefly
   laid out Hartson's former Wimbledon clubmate Hreidarsson was spotted by
   the referee. Hartson's next intervention gave Coventry much more of a
   lift, his deft header setting up John Eustace, to whose superb instant
   drive Branagan responded with a breathtaking one-handed save. Then
   Hartson sent through Craig Bellamy who, pursued by a posse, poked the
   ball across the face of Branagan's goal.

   So it was harsh that Coventry, just as they were threatening to draw
   level, should fall further behind. Poor clearances, first by Kirkland
   and then Gary Breen, issued an invitation to the home side and Wright
   took it with relish, letting fly from 25 yards. Kirkland's gape
   suggested a deflection on the way into the net.

UK Athletics chief Neils De Vos puts Olympic gold rush down to 'technological
doping’

Niels de Vos, the chief executive of UK Athletics, has suffered a serious
embarrassment after a private speech in which he described the
multi-million-pound investments in hi-tech Olympic sports such as cycling,
rowing and sailing as “technological doping” was posted on the YouTube
website.

   De Vos, who has been in charge of the athletics governing body since
   2007, was delivering what he clearly understood to be a private lecture
   to students of his former Oxford University college, Keble, a month
   after the Olympic Games.

   But on Friday night he was forced to own up to an “ill-chosen phrase”
   after drawing a distinction between the technology-driven sports that
   delivered the bulk of Britain’s gold medals at London 2012 and his own
   sport of track and field.

   Outlining the history of Lottery investment since the low point of the
   1996 Atlanta Olympics when Britain managed just a single gold medal, De
   Vos highlighted the influence of Peter Keen, who preceded David
   Brailsford as performance director of British Cycling.

   De Vos said: “Peter Keen came in and said, ‘Forget about cycling, it’s
   all about sprinting on the track because if you give me money I can
   make a difference and win medals’.

   “That philosophy flowed through. It flowed through rowing, it flowed
   through sailing. We had an inbuilt advantage anyway as we could afford
   to do those sports. But you knew that if you were technologically ahead
   of everyone else, it could make half a second difference.

   “They talk about aggregation of marginal gains. I personally don’t buy
   it. It’s actually technological doping, but none the less it works and
   we’ve won a vast number of medals as a result of it.

   “You can’t do that in track and field athletics. You can’t do it in a
   team sport where the bounce of a ball can make the difference between
   success and failure.”

   De Vos’s remarks came in an hour-long lecture on elite performance,
   motivation, and leadership in the wake of London 2012.

   On Friday night, he said his comments were in response to a question
   from the audience and that he was not criticising other Olympic sports
   but merely pointing out the difference with athletics.

   “I made the point, and perhaps it was an ill-chosen phrase, that one of
   the reasons we do well in certain sports is perhaps because we have the
   financial wherewithal to achieve a level that others can’t.

   “There are some sports where certain well-applied financial modals can
   bring you a certain advantage. My point was that it doesn’t apply in
   athletics. It’s very, very hard to achieve that.”

   During the lecture, De Vos also turned his ire on the Education
   Secretary, Michael Gove, describing his policies on school sport as
   “stupid”.

   Criticising the Government for its failure to deliver an effective
   Olympic legacy in terms of school sport provision, De Vos said: “It’s
   not the place for political grandstanding but Michael Gove’s decision
   of two years ago to effectively take it off the curriculum for infants
   schools and make it an optional curriculum for junior schools seems to
   me the single-minded most stupid piece of dogma that has imposed upon
   anybody for a very, very long time.

   “I think they probably realise that by now and are finding it quite
   hard to back-rack from that position in the glory of the Games.”

   De Vos insisted on Friday night that he stood by his position. “I do
   think that,” he said.

   “I think it’s wrong because actually 20 or 30 years down the line, if
   we haven’t got active sport in schools we will suffer as a sporting
   nation.”

   De Vos’s lecture concluded with reflections on the performance of
   Britain’s track and field athletes at the London Olympics and he
   admitted that the euphoria of the gold rush on ‘Super Saturday’ had
   masked deficiencies in the rest of the squad.

   “Actually we didn’t have a great Games,” he said. “We had quite a bad
   Games. Things didn’t go the way we wanted it to. We didn’t get as many
   finalists as we wanted or as many personal bests as we wanted. There
   were some spectacular under-performances.

   “But actually, you know what, it didn’t mater because we’re so obsessed
   by the culture of celebrity and gold that 99 per cent of the population
   would go, ‘Athletics had an absolutely fantastic Games’.”

   government is poised to cheat the British people of the Brexit they
   voted for Credit: EPA/STEPHANIE LECOCQ

   When I heard that the government minister Lord Prior had told a meeting
   of tech and insurance leaders last week that they shouldn’t worry about
   barriers to entry for future employees from the EU, I thought he’d gone
   too far. How could a Brexit administration elected on a promise of
   reducing net migration to the tens of thousands tolerate such
   behaviour? Surely Lord Prior would be sacked?

   Instead, it got worse. A new Cabinet consensus around transitional
   arrangements has been unveiled. Under it, open borders will be
   maintained for a minimum of two years after we finally leave the EU in
   2019. Britain will have to wait until at least 2021 – five years after
   the Brexit referendum – to take back control....

Sex, divorce and infidelity: Meet the Muslim women bloggers tackling taboos

A new wave of Muslim female bloggers is tackling issues traditionally
considered taboo by their communities, and trying to shatter stereotypes
around their culture. Alia Waheed speaks to some of them

   By Alia Waheed

   8:00AM BST 14 Aug 2015

   At a time when the lens of the media is trained on the Muslim community
   like never before and it seems we read near-daily reports of teen girls
   fleeing the UK to marry Isil fighters, it’s strange how little we
   actually know about the lives of young, British Muslim women.

   That could be about to change.

   A growing number of Muslim female bloggers are now giving voice to
   their experience and challenging the misconceptions that exist, both
   within their own communities and society as a whole.

   After generations of having their voices silenced by their own culture,
   they now face a new challenge from organisations like Britain First - a
   BNP splinter group - who have attempted to hijack issues affecting
   Muslim women to further their own causes.

   What makes the phenomenon remarkable is that many of these bloggers are
   choosing to lift the veil of anonymity, in order to discuss issues that
   have been traditionally swept under the carpet for fear of a backlash
   from the community and to protect family honour.

   By talking openly about their personal experiences, they are succeeding
   in challenging taboos around subjects such as religion and sexuality,
   and redefining society's perception of what it is to be a Muslim woman.

   this is how Muslim girls are often portrayed in the media  Photo: Tim
   Stewart News

   One reason for the sudden surge in Muslim female bloggers is technology
   – social media and blogging platforms give them control over their
   voices like never before.

   Another explanation is the growing confidence of Muslim women as
   individuals, at a time when there is an increasing sense of their
   community being under attack. This makes them want to assert their
   British identity more forcefully than ever before and this certainty
   around their nationality is giving them the confidence to explore
   deeper issues that stem from their dual cultural and religious
   heritage.

   While they are proud of it, they also see its faults - and are not
   afraid to challenge them.

   Maryam Din, whose blog ‘Five Pillars and Six Colours’ chronicles her
   experience of reconciling her religious, cultural and sexual identity -
   as a gay, Muslim feminist - tells me:

   “Social media is, on the whole, a safe space for me. It’s not very
   often that negativity penetrates that. However, much like in real life,
   there will be times when it happens. I've faced racism and Islamophobia
   from the non-Muslim community, and homophobia within the Muslim
   community. However, my experiences have largely been positive.

   “Muslim women are now being open about themselves and their lives
   because we've had enough, both from within and outside of the Muslim
   community and enough of being silenced.

   “Between the constant wave of Islamophobia across Europe and
   politicians thinking they’re trying to do what’s best for us, while not
   actually consulting us - like banning our cultural and religious dress
   in public - it isn't really difficult to see why there has been an
   upsurge of Muslim women speaking out.

   “These preconceived ideas about Muslim women aren't ever positive and
   are rife with a mixture of Islamophobia, racism and sexism. Blogs like
   mine challenge these misconceptions simply by existing.

   “In a world that sees Muslim women as oppressed and marginalised,
   visibility is a radical and political act, which unapologetically says
   we love who we are and what we stand for."

   double-gold

   • What Muslim women really want in the bedroom

   Giving Muslim women an authentic voice was one of the reasons Mehreen
   Baig, a teacher from North London, decided against remaining anonymous
   when she began her blog, 'Queen Mehreen: Brown Girl Talks'.

   Her blog - which has more than 10,000 readers - ranges from humorous
   descriptions of the arranged marriage system and being considered left
   on the shelf at the grand age of 25; to sexual harassment at work and
   being judged for not wearing a hijab.

   “My blog started off as a diary of my feelings and frustrations,” she
   explains.

   “There are lots of issues that never get addressed, out of fear of
   judgement or because we don't have a platform to express ourselves. I
   was advised on numerous occasions to remain anonymous in case of any
   backlash.

   “My mum was scared that I was so honest and blunt with my opinions. But
   my blog represents my feelings. I feel no animosity toward anyone, nor
   am I inciting any hatred or disrespect. If I truly believe I’m not
   doing anything wrong, so I shouldn't have to hide.

   “My blogs are a voice for the young British Asian woman. To hide my
   identity would defeat the purpose of showing we are proud of how we
   feel and our experiences. Though I have received negative comments,
   they have been a minority and they have actually validated what my blog
   is talking about.

   "There has been huge media attention on the oppressed Muslim girl or
   the "Muslim girl gone bad" but these are stereotypes that most of us
   can't relate to. Where are the majority of us, the ones who are
   comfortable with being British and Muslim? I hope blogs like mine
   represent those women- the majority who are unfortunately the least
   visible."

   Blogger Mehreen Baig

   For many women bloggers, it’s also a therapeutic experience, albeit
   driven by the desire to empower other women. Laila Ali, 30, started her
   blog ‘Desi, Divorced and Damn Fabulous’, after discovering a lack of
   emotional support and information for Muslim women facing the end of
   their marriages, and to take a stand against the stigma associated with
   female divorcees.

   “I was hurting badly when I discovered my husband's infidelity. I
   searched for websites to try to connect with people who were in the
   same boat as me and found plenty about adultery and divorce, but none
   were directed towards a Muslim woman’s experience,” she says.

   “This prompted me to write about my circumstances. I realised that,
   while there had been no helpful information available to me, perhaps
   through writing about my own experience it might helps someone else.

   “We are tired of being told how to behave. This was one of the most
   heart-wrenching moments of my life yet we [divorcees] are considered
   'unclassy' or 'a woman scorned' for even existing, let alone talking
   about it.

   “I won’t pretend five years of my life didn't exist. Everything that
   has happened has shaped me into the person I am now. Though blog is
   quite open at criticising the Muslim community, on the flipside, it
   does show that Muslim woman are strong, we won't be broken.”
