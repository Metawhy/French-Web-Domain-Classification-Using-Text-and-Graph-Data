Registrant Rights and Responsibilities Under the 2009 Registrar Accreditation
Agreement

   Background: One of the new provisions added to the 2009 RAA requires
   ICANN to develop in consultation with registrars a webpage that
   identifies available registrant rights and responsibilities. This
   published document is the result of initial input from a joint working
   group of the GNSO Council and the At-Large Advisory Committee and
   subsequent consultations with the registrars; and provides a "plain
   language" summary of registrant rights and responsibilities that
   currently exist under the 2009 RAA.

Introduction

   This document provides some "plain language" summarization of terms
   related to Registrant Rights and Responsibilities as set out in the
   Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA), for posting on Registrar
   websites. While some of the terms included here do not specifically
   refer to registrants, those terms are included because of the potential
   import to understanding registrar/registrant relations. This document
   also summarizes registrant rights and responsibilities that arise
   within ICANN Consensus Policies and specifications, as those policies
   and specifications are incorporated into the RAA.'

   The summarization of terms within this document do not override or
   replace the terms set forth in the RAA or within those specifications
   or policy.

Preamble

   In order to register a domain name, a Registered Name Holder (also
   known as a Registrant) has to use the services of an ICANN-accredited
   Registrar. In order to become an ICANN-accredited Registrar, the
   Registrar must enter into a contract with ICANN, referred to as the
   Registrar Accreditation Agreement or the RAA. The RAA sets out various
   rights and responsibilities for Registrants, and Registrants have
   additional rights and responsibilities that are set forth in separate
   ICANN policies and specifications that the Registrars agree to follow.

   The RAA and the related policies are drafted in very specific, often
   legal terminology. In order to help Registrants better understand the
   rights and responsibilities that come along with the registration of a
   domain name, these rights and responsibilities are being summarized and
   presented within a single document. The summaries provided here do not
   override or replace the actual terms as written in the RAA or the
   related policies and specifications.

RAA Terms of Interest

   As the RAA is between ICANN and a Registrar, no one else – including a
   Registered Name Holder – may sue ICANN or the Registrar to claim a
   breach of the RAA.

   Registrars may not make claims that they can provide registrants with
   superior access to any relevant TLD in comparison to other Registrars.

   Some of the Registrar obligations are dependent upon Registered Name
   Holders fulfilling certain responsibilities, particularly as it relates
   to payment of registration fees, submission of required data points to
   the Registrars, and submission of accurate data and timely updates to
   that required data. Registrars also have specific items on which they
   must provide notice to Registered Name Holders, including notifications
   of the end of a registration term, use of Registered Name Holder’s
   Personal Data, and notices regarding escrowing of data for domain names
   registered through privacy or proxy registration services, as well as
   the posting of fees for the recovery of registered names.

   Registrar Submission of Data to Registry Operators

   For each relevant TLD, Registrars must submit certain data points
   relating to each Registered Name within a TLD:
     * The name of the Registered Name being registered (3.2.1.1);
     * The IP addresses of the primary nameserver and secondary
       nameserver(s) for the Registered Name (3.2.1.2);
     * The corresponding names of those nameservers (3.2.1.3);
     * Unless automatically generated by the registry system, the identity
       of the Registrar (3.2.1.4);
     * Unless automatically generated by the registry system, the
       expiration date of the registration (3.2.1.5); and
     * Any other data the Registry Operator requires be submitted to it
       (3.2.1.6).

   Registered Name Holders are normally required to provide the Registrar
   with information relating to nameservers (3.2.1.2 – 3), and there may
   be additional data required under Section 3.2.1.6 that the Registered
   Name Holder must provide. If the Registered Name Holder provides an
   update on these data points, the Registrar has five (5) days to provide
   the update to the Registry Operator.

   Whois Data

   Registrars are required to have an interactive web page and port 43
   Whois service that is available to the public to query free of charge.
   The RAA specifies certain data points that must be provided in response
   to a query:
     * The Registered Name (3.3.1.1);
     * The names of the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for
       the Registered Name (3.3.1.2);
     * The identity of Registrar (which may be provided through
       Registrar's website) (3.3.1.3);
     * The original creation date of the registration (3.3.1.4);
     * The expiration date of the registration (3.3.1.5);
     * The name and postal address of the Registered Name Holder (3.3.1.6)
     * The name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number,
       and (where available) fax number of the technical contact for the
       Registered Name (3.3.1.7); and
     * The name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number,
       and (where available) fax number of the administrative contact for
       the Registered Name (3.3.1.8).

   These data points are commonly referred to as Whois data. As discussed
   below, Registered Name Holders are required to provide a Registrar with
   timely updates to Whois data for a Registered Name. Upon receiving the
   update, a Registrar is to "promptly" update the Whois data. Registrars
   may contract out the maintenance of the public query function.

   The RAA allows Registrars to provide bulk access to Whois data to third
   parties. When providing bulk access or access to the Whois data through
   the public query function, the Registrar is required to restrict access
   for high volume queries or other restrictions on uses of Whois data as
   specified in the RAA, including marketing activities and mass
   solicitations. If a Registrar contracts the public function query to an
   outside party, the Registrar must require any contractor providing the
   port 43 service to impose the same restrictions on access to and use of
   the Whois data.

   Communications with Registered Name Holders

   Registrars are required to maintain records of all communications with
   Registered Name Holders, as well as records of information provided to
   Registry Operators.

   Escrow of Registered Name Holder Data

   A Registrar is required to maintain a database of all Whois data for
   all Registered Names registered through the Registrar’s accreditation,
   as well as all data the Registrar submits to the Registry Operator. In
   addition, the Registrar must include in the database the name and
   (where available) postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone
   number, and fax number of the billing contact for each Registered Name.

   In some instances, a registrant may choose to limit the amount of
   personal information that a Registrar makes available in a Whois query.
   To do so, the name may be registered through a privacy service
   (allowing a registrant to conceal personal identifying information and
   often replacing it with the information of the privacy service).
   Customers may also choose to register names through a proxy service,
   where the proxy service is the Registered Name Holder, and the proxy
   service licenses the use of the domain name to the customer. In that
   situation, the proxy service, as the Registered Name Holder, has its
   information listed for most or all required data points.

   When a Registered Name is registered through a privacy or proxy
   registration service, that affects the information that is placed in
   the database, and a Registrar must do one of two things: The Registrar
   must either (1) include in the database the name and postal address,
   e-mail address, and voice telephone number provided by the customer in
   connection with each registration, even when a privacy or proxy
   registration is used; or (2) at the time that a customer elects to use
   a privacy or proxy registration service, display a notice that the
   customer’s data is not being escrowed. When a customer’s data is not
   being escrowed, only the contact information associated with the
   privacy or proxy registration service will be escrowed. If a customer’s
   data is not escrowed, and only the information of the proxy or privacy
   service is maintained in the database, in the event of Registrar or
   Registry failure future notices may only be sent to the contact
   information within the database.

   Registrar Business Dealings with Registrants

   The RAA imposes many requirements on a Registrar’s business dealings,
   including its dealings with Registered Name Holders.

   A registrar may not activate a Registered Name until it receives
   reasonable assurance from the Registered Name Holder that the
   registration fee will be paid.

   The RAA sets forth actions the Registrar may take at the conclusion of
   the registration period if a Registered Name Holder has not provided
   consent to renew the registration, including the Registrar cancelling
   the registration at the end of the current registration term. If the
   Registered Name Holder did not consent to renewal, the Registrar must
   make sure that a Registered Name is deleted from the Registry database
   within 45 days of the end of the registration term.

   This right for the Registrar to cancel the registration and the
   obligation to the delete the domain name is not absolute. Section
   3.7.5.1 of the RAA sets forth a list of potential "extenuating
   circumstances," that, if exist, allows the Registrar to renew the
   domain name even without the consent of the Registered Name Holder.
   These circumstances include the Registered Name being subject to a UDRP
   action, court order, bankruptcy proceeding, or billing dispute, among
   other items. The Registrar must keep a record of reasons why the
   Registrar renewed a registration without the consent of a Registered
   Name Holder.

   Registrars have to provide each new registrant with notice of the
   Registrar’s deletion and auto-renewal policies. If the Registrar’s
   deletion policy changes during the time of the registration agreement,
   the Registrar has to make efforts to inform the registrants of those
   policy changes. Details of the deletion and auto-renewal policies have
   to be displayed on any website the Registrar operates for domain name
   registration and renewal, and the Registrar should also state on those
   sites any fee that will be charged for the recovery of a domain name
   during the Redemption Grace Period (the 30 day period of time during
   which the name is in "Pending Delete" status with the Registry).^1

   If a Registered Name is the subject of a UDRP dispute at the time of
   deletion or expiration of the registration, the UDRP complainant has
   the right to renew (or restore, in the case of a deletion) the domain
   name. If the complainant renews or restores the name, the Registrar
   must place the name in a HOLD or LOCK status,^2 and must modify the
   Whois information to show that the name is subject to dispute. Section
   3.7.5.7 of RAA also provides for a right for the original domain name
   registrant to recover or renew the name in the event the UDRP complaint
   is terminated without decision, or the UDRP complaint is decided in
   favor of the original domain name registrant.

   The Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement

   Registrars are required to enter into electronic or paper registration
   agreements with all Registered Name Holders. According to the RAA, the
   Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement must include – at minimum –
   the following items (as stated at Sections 3.7.7.1 – 12 of the RAA):
     * The Registered Name Holder must provide "accurate and reliable
       contact details" and must "promptly correct and update them" during
       the registration term. The details required are stated in Section
       3.7.7.1.: "the full name, postal address, e-mail address, voice
       telephone number, and fax number if available of the Registered
       Name Holder; name of authorized person for contact purposes in the
       case of an Registered Name Holder that is an organization,
       association, or corporation; and the data elements listed in
       Subsections 3.3.1.2, 3.3.1.7 and 3.3.1.8."
     * If a Registered Name Holder intentionally provides inaccurate or
       unreliable information, intentionally fails to promptly update the
       information, or fails to respond over fifteen (15) days to
       Registrar inquiries about the accuracy of the contact details, the
       Registered Name Holder will be in material breach of the agreement
       and the registration may be cancelled.
     * Whoever is listed as the Registered Name Holder must provide full
       contact information, and is the Registered Name Holder of record.
       Sometimes a Registered Name Holder may register a domain name and
       then allow another person to use the domain name (such as a website
       designer registering a domain name for a client). If this happens,
       and the person actually using the name did not enter into the
       Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement (referred to as a "third
       party" in the RAA), the Registered Name Holder could be accountable
       for wrongful use of the domain name by the third party. This will
       happen if the Registered Name Holder is provided with "reasonable
       evidence of actionable harm" from the third party’s use of the
       domain name. In that situation the Registered Name Holder will
       "accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the Registered
       Name," unless the Registered Name Holder discloses the user’s
       identity and current contact information.
     * The Registrar must provide notice of how it intends to use data
       provided by the Registered Name Holder and who will received the
       Registered Name Holder’s data. The Registrar must also provide
       notice of how Registered Name Holders may access and update data.
       Additionally, the Registrar must identify which data points the
       Registered Name Holder must provide to the Registrar, and what
       information can be provided on a voluntary basis. The Registered
       Name Holder must consent to all of these data processing terms.
     * If a Registered Name Holder provides the Registrar with Personal
       Data on behalf of any person who did not enter into the
       Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement (the "third party"
       discussed above), the Registered Name Holder must confirm that it
       (1) provided those third-party individuals with the same data
       processing notices that the Registrar provides, and (2) received
       the same consents from the third party regarding the Registrar’s
       data processing terms.
     * A Registrar may only process the Registered Name Holder’s data as
       stated in the data processing notices described above.
     * A Registrar has to agree that it will take reasonable precautions
       to protect the Registered Name Holder’s data from "loss, misuse,
       unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction."
     * Registered Name Holders must represent that: "to the best of the
       Registered Name Holder's knowledge and belief, neither the
       registration of the Registered Name nor the manner in which it is
       directly or indirectly used infringes the legal rights of any third
       party." This means that the Registered Name Holder must represent
       to the Registrar that the domain name is not being registered for
       use in a way that would violate the legal rights of others. An
       example of this "infringement" could be a registration of a domain
       name that violates a trademark or copyright held by someone that is
       not the Registered Name Holder.^3
     * If there is a dispute in connection with the use of the registered
       name, the Registered Name Holder must agree to jurisdiction of the
       courts in at least one of two places: where the Registrar is
       located (often stated on the website or in the Registrar/Registered
       Name Holder Agreement) or the "Registered Name Holder's domicile."
       "Domicile" is a word with legally-specific meaning, but typically
       will be the location the Registered Name Holder provides to the
       Registrar in the required Personal Data. Agreeing to jurisdiction
       means that the Registered Name Holder agrees that the courts in
       those locations have the power to decide these types of cases.^4
     * The Registered Name Holder must agree that its registration is
       subject to "suspension, cancellation, or transfer" for the reasons
       stated in Section 3.7.7.11. Those reasons include: if an ICANN
       adopted specification or policy requires it or if a registrar or
       registry procedure requires it "to correct mistakes by Registrar or
       the Registry Operator in registering the name or for the resolution
       of disputes concerning the Registered Name." For example, the UDRP
       is an ICANN adopted policy that specifies that an administrative
       panel hearing a domain name dispute could order that a domain name
       registration be suspended, transferred or cancelled, and the
       Registered Name Holder has to agree that this is a possibility.
     * The Registered Name Holder shall "indemnify and hold harmless the
       Registry Operator and its directors, officers, employees, and
       agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities,
       costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
       arising out of or related to the Registered Name Holder's domain
       name registration." At its simplest, this means that if the
       Registry Operator (or its employees, etc.) for the registered name
       is sued because of the Registered Name Holder’s domain name
       registration, the Registered Name Holder will pay the Registry
       Operator for all fees and expenses in defending against the suit as
       well as pay for any judgments or liabilities awarded. This
       "indemnification" is not solely limited to court cases.

   Verification of contact information

   As described in more detail below, there are specifications and
   policies that may be created and that apply to the Registrars. Some of
   the specifications or policies may address a Registrar's obligation to
   verify the contact information supplied by the Registered Name Holder
   when the domain is first registered, as well as setting out
   requirements for periodic re-verification of contact information.

   Registrars are also required to take "reasonable steps" to verify
   contact information in the event any person notifies the Registrar that
   contact information for a Registered Name is inaccurate. The Registrar
   also has obligations to act to correct inaccuracies in contact
   information that the Registrar becomes aware of, even if the inaccuracy
   was not reported by anyone.

   The Registrar must also maintain proper contact information for itself,
   including a valid email and mailing address. This contact information
   should be posted on the Registrar’s website.

   Reseller arrangements

   The RAA imposes obligations on Registrars working with third-party
   Resellers – persons or entities that the Registrar contracts with to
   provide Registrar Services. The RAA now requires Registrars to include
   specific items in the Registrar/Reseller Agreements, including:
   prohibiting the Reseller from making representations that it is
   accredited by ICANN; requiring that all Reseller registration
   agreements include all provisions that the Registrar is required to
   include in its Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement; requiring
   the posting of all links to all ICANN websites that the Registrar is
   obligated to post; and identification of the sponsoring registrar. The
   Reseller is also required to make sure that that if a customer is using
   a Reseller’s privacy or proxy registration service for a domain name
   registration, the Reseller does one of the following three things: (1)
   deposit the identity and contact information of the customer with the
   Registrar; (2) deposit the identity and contact information in escrow;
   or (3) posts a notice to the customer that their contact information is
   not being escrowed.

   The RAA also requires the Registrar to take compliance and enforcement
   action against a Reseller violating any of the required provisions.

Other Policies/Specifications

   The Restored Names Accuracy Policy
   (http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/rnap.htm) requires that when a
   registrar restores a name (from the redemption grace period) that had
   been deleted on the basis of submission of false contact data or
   non-response to registrar inquiries, the name must be placed on
   Registrar Hold status until the registrant has provided updated and
   accurate Whois information.

   In addition to the RAA requirement that a Registered Name Holder
   represent that to the best of its knowledge, the registration or use of
   the domain name does not infringe on the legal rights of others, the
   Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ("UDRP") requires that
   same representation to be made, as well as a representation that the
   domain name is not being registered for an unlawful purpose, and will
   not be used in violation of any applicable laws.

   The UDRP also requires Registered Name Holders to submit to mandatory
   administrative proceedings to resolve disputes under the UDRP. These
   mandatory administrative proceedings, as described in the UDRP, are
   disputes that are filed before one of the ICANN approved UDRP dispute
   resolution providers (listed at
   http://www.icann.org/en/dndr/udrp/approved-providers.htm) and following
   the uniform Rules for UDRP administrative proceedings (set out at
   http://www.icann.org/en/dndr/udrp/uniform-rules.htm). The requirement
   for submission to mandatory administrative proceedings does not mean
   that Registered Name Holders cannot also have judicial proceedings
   filed against them for the same or similar conduct. Similar to the
   jurisdictional requirements set out in the RAA, the requirement to
   submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding means that the
   Registered Name Holder cannot dispute the UDRP provider’s ability to
   hear a dispute that is otherwise properly brought under the UDRP.

   The Policy on Transfers of Registrations between Registrars provides
   that Registered Name Holders have the right to transfer domain name
   registrations among registrars. The transfer policy imposes time limits
   on when the Registrar must respond to a transfer request. The right to
   transfer is not absolute – there are ICANN and Registry policies that
   may set limits on the transfer right, including: limitations on when a
   domain name may be transferred (measured from dates of creation or
   earlier transfer); and the Registered Name Holder providing of required
   authorization and documentation for Registrar review. The Registrar of
   Record may only deny a transfer in the following instances:
     * Evidence of fraud
     * UDRP action
     * Court order by a court of competent jurisdiction
     * Reasonable dispute over the identity of the Registered Name Holder
       or Administrative Contact
     * No payment for previous registration period (including credit card
       charge-backs) if the domain name is past its expiration date or for
       previous or current registration periods if the domain name has not
       yet expired. In all such cases, however, the domain name must be
       put into "Registrar Hold" status by the Registrar of Record prior
       to the denial of transfer.
     * Express written objection to the transfer from the Transfer
       Contact. (e.g. - email, fax, paper document or other processes by
       which the Transfer Contact has expressly and voluntarily objected
       through opt-in means)
     * A domain name was already in "lock status" provided that the
       Registrar provides a readily accessible and reasonable means for
       the Registered Name Holder to remove the lock status.
     * The transfer was requested within 60 days of the creation date as
       shown in the registry Whois record for the domain name.
     * A domain name is within 60 days (or a lesser period to be
       determined) after being transferred (apart from being transferred
       back to the original Registrar in cases where both Registrars so
       agree and/or where a decision in the dispute resolution process so
       directs).

   ^1 A graphic representation of the life cycle of a typical gTLD
   Registered Name is located at
   http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/gtld-lifecycle.htm. This diagram may
   be useful to refer to for more information on the post-expiration
   status of domain names.

   ^2 There are formal technical names for domain name statuses, arising
   out of the community-based Internet draft Request for Comments. The
   statuses required here are set by the Registrar. When a registration is
   in one of these statuses, the domain cannot be deleted and the
   registration cannot be modified. The Registrar must alter the status in
   order for any modification to occur.

   ^3 There are many other potential ways to "infringe the legal rights"
   of others, and potential Registered Name Holders are encouraged to seek
   independent advice if they are concerned that the registration or use
   of a domain name may violate someone else’s rights.

   ^4 There could be other jurisdictions that are able to decide a dispute
   about the use of a registered name, but those additional jurisdictions
   are not specified in the RAA.

   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a
   name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not
   an IDN."

Domain Name Registrants' Rights:

    1. Your domain name registration and any privacy/proxy services you
       may use in conjunction with it must be subject to a Registration
       Agreement with an ICANN Accredited Registrar.
          + You are entitled to review this Registration Agreement at any
            time, and download a copy for your records.
    2. You are entitled to accurate and accessible information about:
          + The identity of your ICANN Accredited Registrar;
          + The identity of any proxy or privacy service provider
            affiliated with your Registrar;
          + Your Registrar's terms and conditions, including pricing
            information, applicable to domain name registrations;
          + The terms and conditions, including pricing information,
            applicable to any privacy services offered by your Registrar;
          + The customer support services offered by your Registrar and
            the privacy services provider, and how to access them;
          + How to raise concerns and resolve disputes with your Registrar
            and any privacy services offered by them; and
          + Instructions that explain your Registrar's processes for
            registering, managing, transferring, renewing, and restoring
            your domain name registrations, including through any proxy or
            privacy services made available by your Registrar.
    3. You shall not be subject to false advertising or deceptive
       practices by your Registrar or though any proxy or privacy services
       made available by your Registrar. This includes deceptive notices,
       hidden fees, and any practices that are illegal under the consumer
       protection law of your residence.

Domain Name Registrants' Responsibilities:

    1. You must comply with the terms and conditions posted by your
       Registrar, including applicable policies from your Registrar, the
       Registry and ICANN.
    2. You must review your Registrar's current Registration Agreement,
       along with any updates.
    3. You will assume sole responsibility for the registration and use of
       your domain name.
    4. You must provide accurate information for publication in
       directories such as WHOIS, and promptly update this to reflect any
       changes.
    5. You must respond to inquiries from your Registrar within fifteen
       (15) days, and keep your Registrar account data current. If you
       choose to have your domain name registration renew automatically,
       you must also keep your payment information current.

   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a
   name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not
   an IDN."

   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a

Registrant Rights and Responsibilities Under the 2009 Registrar Accreditation
Agreement

   Background: One of the new provisions added to the 2009 RAA requires
   ICANN to develop in consultation with registrars a webpage that
   identifies available registrant rights and responsibilities. This
   published document is the result of initial input from a joint working
   group of the GNSO Council and the At-Large Advisory Committee and
   subsequent consultations with the registrars; and provides a "plain
   language" summary of registrant rights and responsibilities that
   currently exist under the 2009 RAA.

Introduction

   This document provides some "plain language" summarization of terms
   related to Registrant Rights and Responsibilities as set out in the
   Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA), for posting on Registrar
   websites. While some of the terms included here do not specifically
   refer to registrants, those terms are included because of the potential
   import to understanding registrar/registrant relations. This document
   also summarizes registrant rights and responsibilities that arise
   within ICANN Consensus Policies and specifications, as those policies
   and specifications are incorporated into the RAA.'

   The summarization of terms within this document do not override or
   replace the terms set forth in the RAA or within those specifications
   or policy.

Preamble

   In order to register a domain name, a Registered Name Holder (also
   known as a Registrant) has to use the services of an ICANN-accredited
   Registrar. In order to become an ICANN-accredited Registrar, the
   Registrar must enter into a contract with ICANN, referred to as the
   Registrar Accreditation Agreement or the RAA. The RAA sets out various
   rights and responsibilities for Registrants, and Registrants have
   additional rights and responsibilities that are set forth in separate
   ICANN policies and specifications that the Registrars agree to follow.

   The RAA and the related policies are drafted in very specific, often
   legal terminology. In order to help Registrants better understand the
   rights and responsibilities that come along with the registration of a
   domain name, these rights and responsibilities are being summarized and
   presented within a single document. The summaries provided here do not
   override or replace the actual terms as written in the RAA or the
   related policies and specifications.

RAA Terms of Interest

   As the RAA is between ICANN and a Registrar, no one else – including a
   Registered Name Holder – may sue ICANN or the Registrar to claim a
   breach of the RAA.

   Registrars may not make claims that they can provide registrants with
   superior access to any relevant TLD in comparison to other Registrars.

   Some of the Registrar obligations are dependent upon Registered Name
   Holders fulfilling certain responsibilities, particularly as it relates
   to payment of registration fees, submission of required data points to
   the Registrars, and submission of accurate data and timely updates to
   that required data. Registrars also have specific items on which they
   must provide notice to Registered Name Holders, including notifications
   of the end of a registration term, use of Registered Name Holder’s
   Personal Data, and notices regarding escrowing of data for domain names
   registered through privacy or proxy registration services, as well as
   the posting of fees for the recovery of registered names.

   Registrar Submission of Data to Registry Operators

   For each relevant TLD, Registrars must submit certain data points
   relating to each Registered Name within a TLD:
     * The name of the Registered Name being registered (3.2.1.1);
     * The IP addresses of the primary nameserver and secondary
       nameserver(s) for the Registered Name (3.2.1.2);
     * The corresponding names of those nameservers (3.2.1.3);
     * Unless automatically generated by the registry system, the identity
       of the Registrar (3.2.1.4);
     * Unless automatically generated by the registry system, the
       expiration date of the registration (3.2.1.5); and
     * Any other data the Registry Operator requires be submitted to it
       (3.2.1.6).

   Registered Name Holders are normally required to provide the Registrar
   with information relating to nameservers (3.2.1.2 – 3), and there may
   be additional data required under Section 3.2.1.6 that the Registered
   Name Holder must provide. If the Registered Name Holder provides an
   update on these data points, the Registrar has five (5) days to provide
   the update to the Registry Operator.

   Whois Data

   Registrars are required to have an interactive web page and port 43
   Whois service that is available to the public to query free of charge.
   The RAA specifies certain data points that must be provided in response
   to a query:
     * The Registered Name (3.3.1.1);
     * The names of the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for
       the Registered Name (3.3.1.2);
     * The identity of Registrar (which may be provided through
       Registrar's website) (3.3.1.3);
     * The original creation date of the registration (3.3.1.4);
     * The expiration date of the registration (3.3.1.5);
     * The name and postal address of the Registered Name Holder (3.3.1.6)
     * The name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number,
       and (where available) fax number of the technical contact for the
       Registered Name (3.3.1.7); and
     * The name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number,
       and (where available) fax number of the administrative contact for
       the Registered Name (3.3.1.8).

   These data points are commonly referred to as Whois data. As discussed
   below, Registered Name Holders are required to provide a Registrar with
   timely updates to Whois data for a Registered Name. Upon receiving the
   update, a Registrar is to "promptly" update the Whois data. Registrars
   may contract out the maintenance of the public query function.

   The RAA allows Registrars to provide bulk access to Whois data to third
   parties. When providing bulk access or access to the Whois data through
   the public query function, the Registrar is required to restrict access
   for high volume queries or other restrictions on uses of Whois data as
   specified in the RAA, including marketing activities and mass
   solicitations. If a Registrar contracts the public function query to an
   outside party, the Registrar must require any contractor providing the
   port 43 service to impose the same restrictions on access to and use of
   the Whois data.

   Communications with Registered Name Holders

   Registrars are required to maintain records of all communications with
   Registered Name Holders, as well as records of information provided to
   Registry Operators.

   Escrow of Registered Name Holder Data

   A Registrar is required to maintain a database of all Whois data for
   all Registered Names registered through the Registrar’s accreditation,
   as well as all data the Registrar submits to the Registry Operator. In
   addition, the Registrar must include in the database the name and
   (where available) postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone
   number, and fax number of the billing contact for each Registered Name.

   In some instances, a registrant may choose to limit the amount of
   personal information that a Registrar makes available in a Whois query.
   To do so, the name may be registered through a privacy service
   (allowing a registrant to conceal personal identifying information and
   often replacing it with the information of the privacy service).
   Customers may also choose to register names through a proxy service,
   where the proxy service is the Registered Name Holder, and the proxy
   service licenses the use of the domain name to the customer. In that
   situation, the proxy service, as the Registered Name Holder, has its
   information listed for most or all required data points.

   When a Registered Name is registered through a privacy or proxy
   registration service, that affects the information that is placed in
   the database, and a Registrar must do one of two things: The Registrar
   must either (1) include in the database the name and postal address,
   e-mail address, and voice telephone number provided by the customer in
   connection with each registration, even when a privacy or proxy
   registration is used; or (2) at the time that a customer elects to use
   a privacy or proxy registration service, display a notice that the
   customer’s data is not being escrowed. When a customer’s data is not
   being escrowed, only the contact information associated with the
   privacy or proxy registration service will be escrowed. If a customer’s
   data is not escrowed, and only the information of the proxy or privacy
   service is maintained in the database, in the event of Registrar or
   Registry failure future notices may only be sent to the contact
   information within the database.

   Registrar Business Dealings with Registrants

   The RAA imposes many requirements on a Registrar’s business dealings,
   including its dealings with Registered Name Holders.

   A registrar may not activate a Registered Name until it receives
   reasonable assurance from the Registered Name Holder that the
   registration fee will be paid.

   The RAA sets forth actions the Registrar may take at the conclusion of
   the registration period if a Registered Name Holder has not provided
   consent to renew the registration, including the Registrar cancelling
   the registration at the end of the current registration term. If the
   Registered Name Holder did not consent to renewal, the Registrar must
   make sure that a Registered Name is deleted from the Registry database
   within 45 days of the end of the registration term.

   This right for the Registrar to cancel the registration and the
   obligation to the delete the domain name is not absolute. Section
   3.7.5.1 of the RAA sets forth a list of potential "extenuating
   circumstances," that, if exist, allows the Registrar to renew the
   domain name even without the consent of the Registered Name Holder.
   These circumstances include the Registered Name being subject to a UDRP
   action, court order, bankruptcy proceeding, or billing dispute, among
   other items. The Registrar must keep a record of reasons why the
   Registrar renewed a registration without the consent of a Registered
   Name Holder.

   Registrars have to provide each new registrant with notice of the
   Registrar’s deletion and auto-renewal policies. If the Registrar’s
   deletion policy changes during the time of the registration agreement,
   the Registrar has to make efforts to inform the registrants of those
   policy changes. Details of the deletion and auto-renewal policies have
   to be displayed on any website the Registrar operates for domain name
   registration and renewal, and the Registrar should also state on those
   sites any fee that will be charged for the recovery of a domain name
   during the Redemption Grace Period (the 30 day period of time during
   which the name is in "Pending Delete" status with the Registry).^1

   If a Registered Name is the subject of a UDRP dispute at the time of
   deletion or expiration of the registration, the UDRP complainant has
   the right to renew (or restore, in the case of a deletion) the domain
   name. If the complainant renews or restores the name, the Registrar
   must place the name in a HOLD or LOCK status,^2 and must modify the
   Whois information to show that the name is subject to dispute. Section
   3.7.5.7 of RAA also provides for a right for the original domain name
   registrant to recover or renew the name in the event the UDRP complaint
   is terminated without decision, or the UDRP complaint is decided in
   favor of the original domain name registrant.

   The Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement

   Registrars are required to enter into electronic or paper registration
   agreements with all Registered Name Holders. According to the RAA, the
   Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement must include – at minimum –
   the following items (as stated at Sections 3.7.7.1 – 12 of the RAA):
     * The Registered Name Holder must provide "accurate and reliable
       contact details" and must "promptly correct and update them" during
       the registration term. The details required are stated in Section
       3.7.7.1.: "the full name, postal address, e-mail address, voice
       telephone number, and fax number if available of the Registered
       Name Holder; name of authorized person for contact purposes in the
       case of an Registered Name Holder that is an organization,
       association, or corporation; and the data elements listed in
       Subsections 3.3.1.2, 3.3.1.7 and 3.3.1.8."
     * If a Registered Name Holder intentionally provides inaccurate or
       unreliable information, intentionally fails to promptly update the
       information, or fails to respond over fifteen (15) days to
       Registrar inquiries about the accuracy of the contact details, the
       Registered Name Holder will be in material breach of the agreement
       and the registration may be cancelled.
     * Whoever is listed as the Registered Name Holder must provide full
       contact information, and is the Registered Name Holder of record.
       Sometimes a Registered Name Holder may register a domain name and
       then allow another person to use the domain name (such as a website
       designer registering a domain name for a client). If this happens,
       and the person actually using the name did not enter into the
       Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement (referred to as a "third
       party" in the RAA), the Registered Name Holder could be accountable
       for wrongful use of the domain name by the third party. This will
       happen if the Registered Name Holder is provided with "reasonable
       evidence of actionable harm" from the third party’s use of the
       domain name. In that situation the Registered Name Holder will
       "accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the Registered
       Name," unless the Registered Name Holder discloses the user’s
       identity and current contact information.
     * The Registrar must provide notice of how it intends to use data
       provided by the Registered Name Holder and who will received the
       Registered Name Holder’s data. The Registrar must also provide
       notice of how Registered Name Holders may access and update data.
       Additionally, the Registrar must identify which data points the
       Registered Name Holder must provide to the Registrar, and what
       information can be provided on a voluntary basis. The Registered
       Name Holder must consent to all of these data processing terms.
     * If a Registered Name Holder provides the Registrar with Personal
       Data on behalf of any person who did not enter into the
       Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement (the "third party"
       discussed above), the Registered Name Holder must confirm that it
       (1) provided those third-party individuals with the same data
       processing notices that the Registrar provides, and (2) received
       the same consents from the third party regarding the Registrar’s
       data processing terms.
     * A Registrar may only process the Registered Name Holder’s data as
       stated in the data processing notices described above.
     * A Registrar has to agree that it will take reasonable precautions
       to protect the Registered Name Holder’s data from "loss, misuse,
       unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction."
     * Registered Name Holders must represent that: "to the best of the
       Registered Name Holder's knowledge and belief, neither the
       registration of the Registered Name nor the manner in which it is
       directly or indirectly used infringes the legal rights of any third
       party." This means that the Registered Name Holder must represent
       to the Registrar that the domain name is not being registered for
       use in a way that would violate the legal rights of others. An
       example of this "infringement" could be a registration of a domain
       name that violates a trademark or copyright held by someone that is
       not the Registered Name Holder.^3
     * If there is a dispute in connection with the use of the registered
       name, the Registered Name Holder must agree to jurisdiction of the
       courts in at least one of two places: where the Registrar is
       located (often stated on the website or in the Registrar/Registered
       Name Holder Agreement) or the "Registered Name Holder's domicile."
       "Domicile" is a word with legally-specific meaning, but typically
       will be the location the Registered Name Holder provides to the
       Registrar in the required Personal Data. Agreeing to jurisdiction
       means that the Registered Name Holder agrees that the courts in
       those locations have the power to decide these types of cases.^4
     * The Registered Name Holder must agree that its registration is
       subject to "suspension, cancellation, or transfer" for the reasons
       stated in Section 3.7.7.11. Those reasons include: if an ICANN
       adopted specification or policy requires it or if a registrar or
       registry procedure requires it "to correct mistakes by Registrar or
       the Registry Operator in registering the name or for the resolution
       of disputes concerning the Registered Name." For example, the UDRP
       is an ICANN adopted policy that specifies that an administrative
       panel hearing a domain name dispute could order that a domain name
       registration be suspended, transferred or cancelled, and the
       Registered Name Holder has to agree that this is a possibility.
     * The Registered Name Holder shall "indemnify and hold harmless the
       Registry Operator and its directors, officers, employees, and
       agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities,
       costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
       arising out of or related to the Registered Name Holder's domain
       name registration." At its simplest, this means that if the
       Registry Operator (or its employees, etc.) for the registered name
       is sued because of the Registered Name Holder’s domain name
       registration, the Registered Name Holder will pay the Registry
       Operator for all fees and expenses in defending against the suit as
       well as pay for any judgments or liabilities awarded. This
       "indemnification" is not solely limited to court cases.

   Verification of contact information

   As described in more detail below, there are specifications and
   policies that may be created and that apply to the Registrars. Some of
   the specifications or policies may address a Registrar's obligation to
   verify the contact information supplied by the Registered Name Holder
   when the domain is first registered, as well as setting out
   requirements for periodic re-verification of contact information.

   Registrars are also required to take "reasonable steps" to verify
   contact information in the event any person notifies the Registrar that
   contact information for a Registered Name is inaccurate. The Registrar
   also has obligations to act to correct inaccuracies in contact
   information that the Registrar becomes aware of, even if the inaccuracy
   was not reported by anyone.

   The Registrar must also maintain proper contact information for itself,
   including a valid email and mailing address. This contact information
   should be posted on the Registrar’s website.

   Reseller arrangements

   The RAA imposes obligations on Registrars working with third-party
   Resellers – persons or entities that the Registrar contracts with to
   provide Registrar Services. The RAA now requires Registrars to include
   specific items in the Registrar/Reseller Agreements, including:
   prohibiting the Reseller from making representations that it is
   accredited by ICANN; requiring that all Reseller registration
   agreements include all provisions that the Registrar is required to
   include in its Registrar/Registered Name Holder Agreement; requiring
   the posting of all links to all ICANN websites that the Registrar is
   obligated to post; and identification of the sponsoring registrar. The
   Reseller is also required to make sure that that if a customer is using
   a Reseller’s privacy or proxy registration service for a domain name
   registration, the Reseller does one of the following three things: (1)
   deposit the identity and contact information of the customer with the
   Registrar; (2) deposit the identity and contact information in escrow;
   or (3) posts a notice to the customer that their contact information is
   not being escrowed.

   The RAA also requires the Registrar to take compliance and enforcement
   action against a Reseller violating any of the required provisions.

Other Policies/Specifications

   The Restored Names Accuracy Policy
   (http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/rnap.htm) requires that when a
   registrar restores a name (from the redemption grace period) that had
   been deleted on the basis of submission of false contact data or
   non-response to registrar inquiries, the name must be placed on
   Registrar Hold status until the registrant has provided updated and
   accurate Whois information.

   In addition to the RAA requirement that a Registered Name Holder
   represent that to the best of its knowledge, the registration or use of
   the domain name does not infringe on the legal rights of others, the
   Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ("UDRP") requires that
   same representation to be made, as well as a representation that the
   domain name is not being registered for an unlawful purpose, and will
   not be used in violation of any applicable laws.

   The UDRP also requires Registered Name Holders to submit to mandatory
   administrative proceedings to resolve disputes under the UDRP. These
   mandatory administrative proceedings, as described in the UDRP, are
   disputes that are filed before one of the ICANN approved UDRP dispute
   resolution providers (listed at
   http://www.icann.org/en/dndr/udrp/approved-providers.htm) and following
   the uniform Rules for UDRP administrative proceedings (set out at
   http://www.icann.org/en/dndr/udrp/uniform-rules.htm). The requirement
   for submission to mandatory administrative proceedings does not mean
   that Registered Name Holders cannot also have judicial proceedings
   filed against them for the same or similar conduct. Similar to the
   jurisdictional requirements set out in the RAA, the requirement to
   submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding means that the
   Registered Name Holder cannot dispute the UDRP provider’s ability to
   hear a dispute that is otherwise properly brought under the UDRP.

   The Policy on Transfers of Registrations between Registrars provides
   that Registered Name Holders have the right to transfer domain name
   registrations among registrars. The transfer policy imposes time limits
   on when the Registrar must respond to a transfer request. The right to
   transfer is not absolute – there are ICANN and Registry policies that
   may set limits on the transfer right, including: limitations on when a
   domain name may be transferred (measured from dates of creation or
   earlier transfer); and the Registered Name Holder providing of required
   authorization and documentation for Registrar review. The Registrar of
   Record may only deny a transfer in the following instances:
     * Evidence of fraud
     * UDRP action
     * Court order by a court of competent jurisdiction
     * Reasonable dispute over the identity of the Registered Name Holder
       or Administrative Contact
     * No payment for previous registration period (including credit card
       charge-backs) if the domain name is past its expiration date or for
       previous or current registration periods if the domain name has not
       yet expired. In all such cases, however, the domain name must be
       put into "Registrar Hold" status by the Registrar of Record prior
       to the denial of transfer.
     * Express written objection to the transfer from the Transfer
       Contact. (e.g. - email, fax, paper document or other processes by
       which the Transfer Contact has expressly and voluntarily objected
       through opt-in means)
     * A domain name was already in "lock status" provided that the
       Registrar provides a readily accessible and reasonable means for
       the Registered Name Holder to remove the lock status.
     * The transfer was requested within 60 days of the creation date as
       shown in the registry Whois record for the domain name.
     * A domain name is within 60 days (or a lesser period to be
       determined) after being transferred (apart from being transferred
       back to the original Registrar in cases where both Registrars so
       agree and/or where a decision in the dispute resolution process so
       directs).

   ^1 A graphic representation of the life cycle of a typical gTLD
   Registered Name is located at
   http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/gtld-lifecycle.htm. This diagram may
   be useful to refer to for more information on the post-expiration
   status of domain names.

   ^2 There are formal technical names for domain name statuses, arising
   out of the community-based Internet draft Request for Comments. The
   statuses required here are set by the Registrar. When a registration is
   in one of these statuses, the domain cannot be deleted and the
   registration cannot be modified. The Registrar must alter the status in
   order for any modification to occur.

   ^3 There are many other potential ways to "infringe the legal rights"
   of others, and potential Registered Name Holders are encouraged to seek
   independent advice if they are concerned that the registration or use
   of a domain name may violate someone else’s rights.

   ^4 There could be other jurisdictions that are able to decide a dispute
   about the use of a registered name, but those additional jurisdictions
   are not specified in the RAA.

   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a
   name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not
   an IDN."

Domain Name Registrants' Rights:

    1. Your domain name registration and any privacy/proxy services you
       may use in conjunction with it must be subject to a Registration
       Agreement with an ICANN Accredited Registrar.
          + You are entitled to review this Registration Agreement at any
            time, and download a copy for your records.
    2. You are entitled to accurate and accessible information about:
          + The identity of your ICANN Accredited Registrar;
          + The identity of any proxy or privacy service provider
            affiliated with your Registrar;
          + Your Registrar's terms and conditions, including pricing
            information, applicable to domain name registrations;
          + The terms and conditions, including pricing information,
            applicable to any privacy services offered by your Registrar;
          + The customer support services offered by your Registrar and
            the privacy services provider, and how to access them;
          + How to raise concerns and resolve disputes with your Registrar
            and any privacy services offered by them; and
          + Instructions that explain your Registrar's processes for
            registering, managing, transferring, renewing, and restoring
            your domain name registrations, including through any proxy or
            privacy services made available by your Registrar.
    3. You shall not be subject to false advertising or deceptive
       practices by your Registrar or though any proxy or privacy services
       made available by your Registrar. This includes deceptive notices,
       hidden fees, and any practices that are illegal under the consumer
       protection law of your residence.

Domain Name Registrants' Responsibilities:

    1. You must comply with the terms and conditions posted by your
       Registrar, including applicable policies from your Registrar, the
       Registry and ICANN.
    2. You must review your Registrar's current Registration Agreement,
       along with any updates.
    3. You will assume sole responsibility for the registration and use of
       your domain name.
    4. You must provide accurate information for publication in
       directories such as WHOIS, and promptly update this to reflect any
       changes.
    5. You must respond to inquiries from your Registrar within fifteen
       (15) days, and keep your Registrar account data current. If you
       choose to have your domain name registration renew automatically,
       you must also keep your payment information current.

   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a
   name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not
   an IDN."

   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a

   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a
   name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not
   an IDN."
