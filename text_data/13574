Boo Biscuits

   [14753913_674500956059269_3794541640768703843_o.jpg]
   1 1/4 cup of rice flour
   3 T vegetable oil
   1/3 cup chicken broth
   Water, as needed
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
   Mix all ingredients together to form a consistency of play-doh. Add
   1-2T of water as needed to make the dough smoother. Roll out the dough
   on a slightly floured surface to about 1/4" thick. Cut out into desired
   shapes. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake for 15-20
   minutes until the bottoms start to lightly brown. Let cool and then
   store in an airtight container. Treats should last 2-3 weeks or longer
   stored in the refrigerator.
   **I used melted carob chips to decorate the biscuits. Do not use
   chocolate. Sorry the picture is a bit blurry!
   I just love how translucent these turn out....just like little ghosts!

Filling of the Kongs - Pumpkin Style

   [IMG_0728.JPG]
   Filling of the Kongs.
   1. A couple chunks of pumpkin (I bought a small pumpkin from my grocery
   store), chopped in mini food processor.
   2. A couple chunks of apple, also put in my mini processor.
   3. Scoop of Peanut Butter.
   4. A pinch of steel cut oats.
   5. A spoonful of coconut oil.
   6. A spoonful of water.
   Mix together. Put a hard treat in the bottom of each kong or you can
   use some of your dogs dry food if you normally serve this type. Scoop
   mixture into a ziplock bag and then cut off a corner to pipe the
   mixture into the Kongs. Freeze and serve frozen for extra effort.
   Hodge Podge Kong Filling. Normally I would add yogurt and/or bananas
   but I did not have any on hand. I only use what is available in my
   kitchen. Spinach & Green Beans are also good mixed! My apple may or may
   not have seen better days. It's a good thing Granger does not care!
   Cross posting on Shaggy Dog Eats.

Gluten, Wheat & Grain-free Pumpkin Balls

   [PumkinBalls.jpg]
   Ingredients:
   1 cup of coconut flour (you can substitute other flours)
   1 large egg with the shell
   2/3 cup of organic pumpkin puree
   1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl whisk together egg,
   egg shell and pumpkin puree until smooth. Be sure to crush up the egg
   shell. Mix in the coconut flour and baking soda using your hand. The
   dough will be crumbly but moist. Form 1 large ball and refrigerate for
   about 15 minutes. Then gently form small bite-sized balls using the
   palms of your hands. Place the balls on a parchment lined baking pan.
   Bake for about 15 minutes. Yields approximately 18 balls.
   If you substitute the flour in this recipe, it will change the texture
   a bit. Just be patient and add your flour a little at a time until you
   have a "workable" dough. For the rest of the month, I will be posting
   recipes with pumpkin to celebrate fall.

Just Add Apples....

   This week's #TreatTuesday is a continuation from last weeks recipe.
   Just add a finely chopped small apple to the 2-Ingredient Straight
   Outta the Panty recipe.  When chopping the apple, leave the skin on and
   remove the core/seeds.  I also like to use a metal cookie cutter to
   help cut through the apples when creating shapes.

   [IMG_0565.JPG]
   Say what?
   AND you should have these ingredients in your pantry.
   So what ya waiting for? Get to baking. Your shaggy friend will thank
   you (& me!).
   I'll also be sharing on Shaggy Dog Eats.
   [IMG_0561.JPG]
   What you need:
   1-cup of flour, any variety that your dog tolerates
   1/2-cups of any variety broth/water, use what is safe for your dog
   Directions:
   350 preheated oven. Mix. Cook for 25 minutes for a chewy treat.
   Hints: Because the type of flour you use will change the consistency in
   the recipe, if the dough is too soft/sticky, add a little more flour.
   If the dough is too stiff, add a little water/broth. Cook for less time
   if you want a softer treat, longer for crispier treats.

2 Ingredient Grain-Free Dog Treats

   [2ingredient.jpg]
   I just worked this recipe up this morning. I wanted a grain-free,
   poultry free treat that was EASY & FAST. This turned out awesome.
   What you need:
   1 jar of 4 ounce baby food, any variety that is safe for your dog
   2 cups of any variety of flour, use what your dog tolerates best
   350 preheated oven. 25 minutes for a crunchy treat.
   Hints: Because the type of flour you use will change the consistency in
   the recipe, if the dough is too soft/sticky, add a little more flour.
   If the dough is too stiff, add a little water. Cook for less time if
   you want a soft treat, longer for crispier treats. Any shape should
   work! Store in an airtight container, I prefer the refrigerator for up
   to a couple of weeks. You can also freeze and store them for a couple
   of months.
