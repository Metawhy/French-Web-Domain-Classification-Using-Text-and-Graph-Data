   Floreo is leveraging the power of Virtual Reality to develop a
   supplementary method of teaching social and communication skills for
   individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our library of lessons
   is fun and engaging for the learner, while also providing a supervising
   adult the opportunity to monitor and track the learner’s progress.
   Floreo is currently being used by schools, therapy practices, and
   parents. Floreo’s lessons are science-based; we are currently running
   several research studies including a study in collaboration with the
   Center for Autism Research at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and
   National Institutes of Health.

   and communication techniques intended to help individuals with ASD
   build real world skills. Specifically, we are developing content for
   learning discrete social behaviors, managing planned and unplanned
   events, and improving sensory and emotional regulation.
