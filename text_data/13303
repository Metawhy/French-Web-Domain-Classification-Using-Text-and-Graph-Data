about

   Estela is a restaurant in downtown Manhattan from chef Ignacio Mattos.
   Set one floor above Houston Street, it is a bistro at heart, taking
   familiar ideas like tartare, ricotta dumplings, burrata on toast, fried
   rice, and steak, and presenting them in new, satisfying ways. The bar
   is open late, and you can come in for just a glass and a small bite,
   should you feel like it. Now in its 5th year, estela has earned
   numerous accolades, including a place on the World’s 50 Best
   Restaurants List and two stars from both New York Magazine and the New
   York Times.

   Ignacio Mattos, Owner and Chef
   Ignacio Mattos is the chef-owner of New York restaurants estela, Café
   Altro Paradiso, and Flora Bar. Born in Uruguay, he has a bold, singular
   style inspired by the city he now calls home, time spent in Europe and
   South America, and the mentorship of chefs Alice Waters, Francis
   Mallmann, and Judy Rodgers. In 2017, Esquire named Ignacio America’s
   Chef of the Year. His first cookbook, Estela, was ranked one of 2018's
   best by the New York Times Book Review.
