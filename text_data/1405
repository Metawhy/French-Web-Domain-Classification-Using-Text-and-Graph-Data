Advent Playlist

   Celebrate· Christmas· For Families

   Our Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express the
   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   This year more than ever my heart is longing for a meaningful
   Christmas. One that speaks loudly of Jesus and less of the noise of
   this world. More about proclaiming His fame and arrival than how many
   crafts we completed or fun things we got to do. Don’t get me wrong, I
   love a good Christmas craft and there is so much joy and life in
   creating special memories with my people, but so many years I have
   completely missed it. I’ve missed my Redeemer in the middle of the
   hustle and bustle of the season.

   I want this year to be different. I want to daily prepare and examine
   my heart for the arrival of Jesus so that I don’t miss out on the true
   joy of Christmas. One of the ways our family is doing this is by
   listening to an Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express
   the expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and
   joy in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   Our Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express the
   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   I have been listening to the Solid Joys Daily Devotional this year
   (which I highly recommend) and was deeply convicted by this thought:

     Build God-centered anticipation and expectancy and excitement into
     your home—especially for the children. If you are excited about
     Christ, they will be too. If you can only make Christmas exciting
     with material things, how will the children get a thirst for God?
     Bend the efforts of your imagination to make the wonder of the
     King’s arrival visible for the children.” [John Piper]

   Our Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express the
   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   This year we intentionally chose to keep things simple. We are reading
   through the Jesus Storybook Bible (affiliate link) paired with these
   gorgeous cards from Crew and Co. We have the cards displayed in our
   living room. I love the daily countdown as we participate in the life
   and lineage of Christ.

   Our Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express the
   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

     “Connecting with the Church Calendar helps us participate in the
     life of Christ by calling us into a rhythm that retraces His life on
     earth, His death, and His resurrection and celebrate with the wider
     Body of Christ– connecting us to the Church historic and the Church
     universal.” Glenn Packiam

   How is your family longing and waiting for Jesus this Advent season? I
   hope this playlist is a helpful tool in pointing you and your little
   ones eyes towards Christ this Christmas. I hope that you and your
   family have a wonderful Advent season as you reflect, ponder, and yearn
   for the return of our Savior.

Love this Advent Playlist? Pin it for later!

Don’t miss out!

   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   This year more than ever my heart is longing for a meaningful
   Christmas. One that speaks loudly of Jesus and less of the noise of
   this world. More about proclaiming His fame and arrival than how many
   crafts we completed or fun things we got to do. Don’t get me wrong, I
   love a good Christmas craft and there is so much joy and life in
   creating special memories with my people, but so many years I have
   completely missed it. I’ve missed my Redeemer in the middle of the
   hustle and bustle of the season.

   I want this year to be different. I want to daily prepare and examine
   my heart for the arrival of Jesus so that I don’t miss out on the true
   joy of Christmas. One of the ways our family is doing this is by
   listening to an Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express
   the expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and
   joy in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   Our Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express the
   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   I have been listening to the Solid Joys Daily Devotional this year
   (which I highly recommend) and was deeply convicted by this thought:

     Build God-centered anticipation and expectancy and excitement into
     your home—especially for the children. If you are excited about
     Christ, they will be too. If you can only make Christmas exciting
     with material things, how will the children get a thirst for God?
     Bend the efforts of your imagination to make the wonder of the
     King’s arrival visible for the children.” [John Piper]

   Our Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express the
   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

   This year we intentionally chose to keep things simple. We are reading
   through the Jesus Storybook Bible (affiliate link) paired with these
   gorgeous cards from Crew and Co. We have the cards displayed in our
   living room. I love the daily countdown as we participate in the life
   and lineage of Christ.

   Our Advent Playlist that is compiled of songs that express the
   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

     “Connecting with the Church Calendar helps us participate in the
     life of Christ by calling us into a rhythm that retraces His life on
     earth, His death, and His resurrection and celebrate with the wider
     Body of Christ– connecting us to the Church historic and the Church
     universal.” Glenn Packiam

   How is your family longing and waiting for Jesus this Advent season? I
   hope this playlist is a helpful tool in pointing you and your little
   ones eyes towards Christ this Christmas. I hope that you and your
   family have a wonderful Advent season as you reflect, ponder, and yearn
   for the return of our Savior.

Love this Advent Playlist? Pin it for later!

   expectancy & waiting of the Advent season. The longing, ache, and joy
   in a promised Savior who will one day renew all things.

Don’t miss out!
