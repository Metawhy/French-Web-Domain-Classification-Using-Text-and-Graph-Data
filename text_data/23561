   Grid'5000

   Grid'5000 is a large-scale and versatile testbed for experiment-driven
   research in all areas of computer science, with a focus on parallel and
   distributed computing including Cloud, HPC and Big Data and IA.

   Key features:
     * provides access to a large amount of resources: 12000 cores, 800
       compute-nodes grouped in homogeneous clusters, and featuring
       various technologies: GPU, SSD, NVMe, 10G and 25G Ethernet,
       Infiniband, Omni-Path
     * highly reconfigurable and controllable: researchers can experiment
       with a fully customized software stack thanks to bare-metal
       deployment features, and can isolate their experiment at the
       networking layer
     * advanced monitoring and measurement features for traces collection
       of networking and power consumption, providing a deep understanding
       of experiments
     * designed to support Open Science and reproducible research, with
       full traceability of infrastructure and software changes on the
       testbed
     * a vibrant community of 500+ users supported by a solid technical
       team

   Rss.svg Default environments and frontends to be updated to Debian 10
   "Buster"

   Dear users,

   We are planning to upgrade nodes default environement (the "-std"
   variant, provided when deployment is not used) to Debian 10 "Buster".
   Switchover is scheduled on September, 26th.

   In addition, frontends will also be upgraded on October 3rd (It has
   already been upgraded on Luxembourg site).

   Remind that this update may need you to modify your scripts (of course
   you will still be able to deploy Debian 9 environments).

   Regards,

   -- Grid'5000 Team 12:00, 20 September 2019 (CET)

   Rss.svg Debian 10 "buster" environments are now available for
   deployments

   Kadeploy images (from min to big) are now available for Debian 10.

   New features and changes in Debian 10 are described in:
   https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-whats-new
   .en.html

   In particular, it includes many software updates:
     * openjdk 11.0.4
     * Python 3.7.3
          + python-numpy 1.16.2
          + python-scipy 1.2.2
          + python-pandas 0.23.3
     * OpenMPI 3.1.3
     * GCC 7.4 and 8.3
     * G++ 8.3.0
     * Libboost 1.67.0.2
     * Ruby 2.5.1
     * Cuda 10.1.168 (418.67)
     * CMake 3.13.4
     * GFortran 8.3.0
     * Liblapack 3.8.0
     * libatlas 0.6.4
     * RDMA 24.0

   Known regressions and problems are :
     * The std environment is not available yet
     * Predicitible network interfaces names changed on chifflot and
       graffiti (see
       https://intranet.grid5000.fr/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9877)
     * Infiniband network support is not operational at the moment

   Let us know if you want us to support some tools, software,... that are
   not available on big and std.

   As a reminder, this is the way you can use an alternate environment
   (https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Getting_Started#Deploying_nodes_with_Kadeplo
   y) :
 $ oarsub -t deploy -I
 $ kadeploy -e debian10-x64-big -f $OAR_NODE_FILE -k

   Please report any problem you encounter with the above environments to
   support-staff@lists.grid5000.fr.

   Rss.svg New cluster available in Nancy: graffiti (52 GPUs)

   We have the pleasure to announce that the Graffiti cluster in Nancy
   (production queue) is now fully operational:

   It features 13 Dell T640 servers nodes with 2 Intel Silver 4110 (8
   cores / 16 threads), 128 GB DDR4, 1x480 GB SSD, 10Gbps Ethernet, and 4
   GPU NVidia RTX2080 Ti per node.

   As this cluster features 4 GPU per node, we remind you that you can
   monitor GPU (and node) usage using the Ganglia tool (std environment
   only):
     * follow
       https://intranet.grid5000.fr/ganglia/?r=2hr&cs=&ce=&m=load_one&s=by
       +name&c=Nancy&tab=m&vn=&hide-hf=false
     * then choose a node (eg. graffiti-3)

   You can also use the nvidia-smi and htop commands on your reserved
   nodes to get more information about your GPU/CPU usage.

   If your experiments do not require all the GPU of a single node, it is
   possible to reserve GPU at the resource level (see
   https://grid5000.fr/w/News#Enabling_GPU_level_resource_reservation_in_O
   AR for some examples).

   Finally, if you know how to use GPUs at their max with widely used
   software (Tensorflow, NAMD, ...) and would like to share your knowledge
   about this, we will be happy to transform your knowledge into Grid5000
   tutorials.

   This cluster has been funded by Ihe CPER LCHN project (Langues,
   Connaissances & Humanités Numériques, Contrat de plan État / Région
   Lorraine 2015-2020), and the LARSEN and MULTISPEECH teams at LORIA /
   Inria Nancy Grand Est.

   Special thanks go to:
     * Marc Vesin (Inria Sophia) and Marianne Lombard (Inria Saclay) for
       their contributions and sharing of experiences on the café cluster
       mailing list which have...

   Rss.svg A new version of tgz-g5k has been released

   We have released a new version of tgz-g5k. Tgz-g5k is a a tool that
   allow you to extract a Grid'5000 environment tarball from a running
   node. The tarball can therefore be used by kadeploy to re-deploy the
   image on different nodes/reservations (see Advanced Kadeploy for more
   details)

   The new version has two major improvements:
    1. tgz-g5k is now compatible with Ubuntu and Centos
    2. tgz-g5k is directly usable on frontends (you do not need to use it
       through ssh anymore).

   To use tgz-g5k from a frontend, you can execute the following command:
  frontend$ tgz-g5k -m MY_NODE -f ~/MY_TARBALL.tgz

   In case of specific or non-deployed environments: - tgz-g5k can use a
   specific user id to access nodes, by using the parameter -u (by default
   tgz-g5k accesses nodes as root) - tgz-g5k can access node with
   oarsh/oarcp instead of ssh/scp, by using the parameter -o (by default
   tgz-g5k uses ssh/scp)

   Note that tg5-g5k is still compatible with the previous command line.
   For the record, you had to use previously the following command:
  frontend$ ssh root@MY_NODE tgz-g5k > ~/MY_TARBALL.tgz
