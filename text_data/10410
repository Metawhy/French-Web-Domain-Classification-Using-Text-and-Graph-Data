Low sew fall leaf felt pillow

   27 Aug

   leaf10

   Bring fall indoors with these SUPER easy fall felt pillows. How easy
   you ask? You don‚Äôt even need a sewing machine to create a mountain of
   fall leaf pillows and there‚Äôs a good chance you have everything you
   need in your house right now.

   These pillows make easy and fun fall crafts. It‚Äôs surprisingly easy to
   bring fall in your living room you‚Äôll be jumping in piles of leaf
   pillows in no time.

   Fall - Felt crafts

   pillow - felt fall crafts

   You will need:

   Standard size pillow case. I used an old standard size bed pillowcase.

   Pillow insert, ‚Äì these work better than stuffing because they create a
   smooth appearance for your pillows. You can buy them premade or simply
   chop a bed pillow to your desired size.

   Felt scraps to cut leaves in fall colors the number you will need will
   depend on the design you choose. I used

   Saddle Brown, Mustard, Egg Yolk, Hot Chocolate, Fresh Cut Grass, Autumn
   Leaves, Tangerine, Darkest Ruby, Chocolate, Poinsettia, Wine and Penny

   Needle and thread.

   otheriopt

   First decide on a design you like, as you can see the options for this
   easy fall felt pillow are endless.

   Leaf shapes template pattern

   Cut the felt leaves from the leaf shaped pattern template. The number
   of leaves you will need depends upon the design you choose. If you need
   some tips on cutting small or difficult shapes check out THIS POST.

   leafpillow I am going to make the striped pillow case but they are all
   made in basically the same way.  Stuff pillowcase with pillow and fold
   extra fabric behind the pillow for now.

   Mark out where you want your design to be. For the circle shape you can
   trace a plate if needed but the leaves on this DIY fall decor hack are
   very forgiving if you want to wing it.  leafpillow2 Measure out a 3.5‚Ä≥
   ‚Äì 4‚Ä≥  past the end of your pillow and trim off the extra fabric.  make
   a felt leaf pillow Lay out your leaves where you‚Äôd like them to be. Pin
   down if desired. Sew felt leaves down with a  few stitches into each
   with a neutral color or consider using a few permanent markers.  You
   can attempt this with the pillow in place with small shallow stitches
   or you can remove the case and sew then sew the felt leaves to your
   pillowcase. pillow4

   felt leaf pillow Small stitches are fine the leaves will flop naturally
   so there is no need to sew each felt leaf shape down completely.
   Continue until your design is sewn down.

   leafpillow4 Fold cut edges of the pillow case  inward and pin folded
   ends together.  sewclosed Overcast stitch along the side of the pillow
   with matching thread to close.  Felt leaf pillow

   And that‚Äôs all it takes to make a pile of felt fall leaf throw pillows.

   Happy Crafting

Felt Cloud Bow Holder

   2 Aug

   67648821_10220161451090188_2244501199665496064_n

   Avoid the chaos of lost bows and clips while creating an adorable puffy
   cloud wall hanger. Best of all no hammers or screwdrivers this fluffy
   friend can be hung up with a simple tack.

   clouds

   This cloud bow holder is the cutest way to keep those little bows,
   barrettes and clips organized. Just in time for back to school. If
   you‚Äôre short on time using stick on felt for the cloud face can cut the
   time down considerably but you can easily just stitch the details into
   place too. I‚Äôve included an option for raindrops if stars don‚Äôt
   coordinate with your space.

You will need:

   White Felt 1/4 yard or 2 ‚Äì 9‚Ä≥ x 12‚Ä≥ sheets*

   Scrap for face I used stick on felt in pink and black.

   Colored Felt 9‚Ä≥ x 5‚Ä≥ scraps

   I used Lavender, Aqua and Orange Whip *

   1 yard 1/4‚Ä≥ wide blue ribbon for hanging stars or raindrops cut into 3
   lengths. (9‚Ä≥, 12‚Ä≥ and 15‚Ä≥)

   7‚Ä≥ ‚Äì 1/2‚Ä≥ wide ribbon for cloud hanger ‚Äì I used a rainbow print ribbon.

   Stuffing

   *coordinating thread

Cut

   Two cloud shapes from white felt. Two cheeks from pink stick on felt
   and two eyes and smile from black stick on felt. Cut 2 stars (or
   raindrops) of each of the three colors. Blue ribbon to 9‚Ä≥, 12‚Ä≥ and 15‚Ä≥
   lengths.

   star1 Attach  ribbon to one of each of the different colors of star
   shapes. overcaststar

   Place star shapes together and overcast stitch around the edges with
   matching thread.

   star2

   Stuff as you go.

   DIY bow holder

   When you reach the ribbon area sew the pieces together with a running
   stitch to close. Repeat with the other two stars and set aside.

   starstickers

   Peel off sticky backed felt and press face into place on one cloud
   side. You can also sew these pieces down if you‚Äôre using standard (not
   sticky backed) felt.
   bluefeltad

   Find the perfect shade of blue for your next project.

   cloudface2

   Attach rainbow ribbon at the top of the cloud as marked on the pattern.

   strap sew Overcast stitch the cloud together stuffing as you go.

   attachstarsfelt.jpg

   Attach the ribbons as marked on the pattern by sewing them in with a
   running stitch. Sew remaining stars into place.
   67472915_10220161451010186_9048958818033074176_n

   Hang and add clips.

12 back to school supplies for felt crafters

   29 Jul

   12 awesome back to school supplies for felt crafters

   If you‚Äôre anything like me the sight of sharpies on sale makes your
   heart skip a beat. Sure the back to school season heralds in shorter
   days, the promise of new friendships and crisp autumn afternoons but
   mostly it‚Äôs all about the amazing sales on school supplies.

   You may not consider the back to school isle to be a treasure trove for
   crafters but with a closer look and you‚Äôll see endless possibilities
   all at great prices. Take advantage of the back to school sales and
   stock up on some unexpected ‚Äúback to school‚Äù items perfect for felt
   crafters. Here‚Äôs our top 12 in no particular order.

12.  Plastic Storage Containers

   6qt+Latching+Tote-+Clear+w_Agave+Lid+and+latches

   Store your felt treasures in air tight comfort with a new plastic tub.
   Small and mid sized tubs aimed at departing college students are often
   on sale at unbeatable prices this time of year.

   Stick with smaller sized boxes (around 6qt or less) so your items are
   snug and easy to sort, opt for a clear tubs to make finding ornaments
   and toys simple. Store your tubs  in  a larger plastic light tight
   opaque storage tub for safety and easy garage storage. For more tips on
   storing felt items see: How to store felt stuff

   Storing things made from felt

11. Rulers

   a Since most felt projects are rather small a standard ruler can handle
   most if not all your projects. This time of year you‚Äôll usually see a
   great assortment of fun sizes, materials and themes. Stock up, now‚Äôs
   your chance to pick them up at a fraction of what they will be in 2
   months.

10. Sketch Book

   sketching felt ornaments

   Stock up on plain sketching paper. Felt Ormaments

   Nothing beats a good hand sketch to get the juices flowing. Having a
   stack of clean white sketching sheets at the ready is a must!
   Interested in making these cuties here are the free tutorials Gumdrops,
   Snowman

9. Scotch Tape

   cutting small shapes from felt

   Clear tape is the magic that makes cutting small shapes a breeze!
   Simply cut closely around your pattern, tape to felt and cut! a4 For
   more tips on cutting with tape see our post on Cutting Small Felt
   Shapes.


8. Pencils

   a2

   Take advantage of fall sales and pick up a pack or two of #2s. A good
   quality freshly sharpened #2 will write on wool blend felt with ease
   making freehand pattern making or template tracing super simple.

   While #2 pencils are the industry standard snatch a set of #1s for a
   softer lead or if you‚Äôre really lucky you may pick up a sketching
   pencil (#‚Äôs 5B- 9B) for soft lead and ultra dark markings just go slow
   and softly so you don‚Äôt end up smearing the lead.

7. Tracing Paper

   aa Tracing paper is a great low tech way to create pattern pieces.
   Trace each segment of a sketch for perfect patterns.

6. Pens

   Quill Pen Topper- felt craft tutorial Ok this one is technically not so
   much for crafting as the actual craft. Treat your future self to some
   fancy fountain pens perfect for all those Christmas cards you‚Äôll be
   firing off in a few months. A well timed back to school buy makes a bag
   of 24 as low as .33! INK PENS FOR EVERYONE!!!

   Get the tutorial for the fancy pen of your dreams HERE  felt craft- pen
   toppers


5. Sharpies

   stripe3

   Color your thread! Low on thread, have an odd color to match or just
   don‚Äôt like stopping to change thread colors? Try using only white
   thread and coloring your tread to match. Simply run the sharpie marker
   (or any permanent marker) over the exposed white thread so it absorbs
   the color. Carefully color the exposed thread allowing the pigment to
   soak in. This works best with cotton threads and wool blend felt.

   btstest

   Pre- test your thread and markers before use by coloring on a bit
   before attempting to color a finished piece. Avoid using on acrylic or
   synthetic felt blends the sharpies won‚Äôt absorb into the acrylic
   creating a marker mess.

   stripe5

   You can also use the pens to outline areas on the felt you want to
   stitch over.

4. Pencil Cases

   bts5.jpg

   Hard sided pencil cases make great thread storage. I was able to fit
   over 20 in each box.

3. Chalk

   bts6 Mark off your patterns standard chalkboard chalk. Standard white
   chalk is great for darker felts, it marks clearly and dusts off easily.
   When working with felt drag lightly across the felt you only want the
   chalk on the surface of the felt not ground into it. When you‚Äôre done
   simply tap or flick a few times to remove all traces. You can also
   remove with a wet wipe by dabbing lightly.

   bts66

   Need a finer edge? Run the chalk piece at an angle along concrete or
   chalk board to create a slanted edge, for very detailed or delicate
   patterns you can grind the chalk and apply with a brush. For more on
   chalk outlines see THIS

2. Pencil Pouch

   bts7 You can take it with you! Pencil pouches make the perfect home for
   your work in progress. Grab it on your way out the door and work on
   your craft during practices, pick ups and lessons. Look for a clear
   pouch to make finding your pieces a snap.

1. 3‚Ä≥ 3 Ring Binder

   bind

   The bigger the better! Store your threads in style by winding them on
   smaller bobbins and sticking them in clear pockets. For the full
   tutorial on making a sheep bobbin binder little bo peep would be proud
   of see our post on Storing Embroidery Thread.

Felt Dragon Egg Tutorial

   26 Apr

   58814599_10219330922487492_4387119366978666496_n

   Become the mother (or father of dragons) and re-take the iron throne
   with your own DIY felt no sew dragon eggs. These dragon eggs make a
   great accessory for any GOT viewing party, a cool costume accessory or
   just a fun table display.

   The addition of glitter felt adds some fun depth and sparkle to the
   eggs. Don‚Äôt let the number scales intimidate you, you can easily cut 2
   or three in a stack.

   58549585_10219330919927428_4988156845567770624_n Best of all these
   beauties are no sew. Don‚Äôt pack up those plastic Easter eggs just yet,
   they play a key role in these Game of Thrones inspired dragon eggs as a
   stable base for the scales.
   58373017_10219330918087382_6714959987501694976_n You will need:

   Plastic Easter eggs ‚Äì you can use any size the ones I selected were 3‚Ä≥
   tall

   Hot glue gun and glue

   9‚Ä≥ x 12‚Ä≥ ‚Äì wool blend felt sheet, I used Granny Smith, Mauve Taupe and
   Fresh Linen

   5‚Ä≥ x  6‚Ä≥ ‚Äì Glitter Felt I used Gold, Champagne and Silver

   Felt dragon egg scale template ‚Äì you can also freehand these.

58633315_10219330917807375_6628760376123064320_n Cut

   9‚Ä≥ x 12‚Ä≥ sheets into scales ‚Äì this should leave you with a few more
   scales that you need.

   Cut glitter felt into scales as well. You can also free hand cut the
   scales or change the shape as desired but for best results you will
   want them all to be around the same size. These are 1‚Ä≥ tall (dragon
   scale template at the end of this post)

   I paired the granny smith with gold, the mauve with the champagne and
   the off white with the silver, the options are nearly limitless.

   58375133_10219330918527393_914904952617304064_n Start gluing scales
   down starting at the larger bottom end. Hot glue down as shown.

   wool blend felt

   57678198_10219330920607445_3707931883242258432_n

   Working in rows glue scales around the egg with the points facing
   downward towards the bigger bottom. Glue down glitter scales randomly
   for depth.

   58461543_10219330922007480_1691211787334057984_n

   Continue until you have covered the entire egg.
