   (“Your Private Dashboard”). You may customize Your Private Dashboard by
   adding or deleting content (either Third-Party Content or Your Content)
   and by moving and editing Widgets. A Widget is a software element
   providing content, including feeds and data. It is composed of computer
   code, exclusive property of 3DS (the “Container”), used to create the
   structure of the Widget and to encapsulate the Third-Party Content
   available through the Widgets.

   Your Private Dashboard is accessible through a personal terminal (such
   as: a computer, a smartphone, or a tablet) by logging in with Your
   email address and Your password. If Your browser accepts "cookies",
   Your Private Dashboard shall automatically be displayed when You
   connect and all the modifications shall be saved in real time.

   The Service enables You to find Widgets from the Website home page, the
   Ecosystem or from the internet and to use them in Your Private
   Dashboard. The content of such Widgets is provided by professional
   content providers, Our partners, other users, or You.

   The Service also enables You to embed Your Content into a Widget ("Your
   Widget") and to post it online, including on the Ecosystem. Once in the
   Ecosystem, Your Widget may be selected and used by users and 3DS
   commercial partners (for instance, to add Your Widget to their
   personalized pages or to download it).

   In addition to Your Private Dashboard, You can also create a
   personalized page accessible to the public and associated with a
   specific URL (“Your Public Page"). Through Your Public Page, you can
   share the Widgets of Your choice, regardless of whether these Widgets
   embed Your Content or Third-Party Content.


Customization

   The Service enables You to customize the appearance of Your Private
   Dashboard and of Your Public Page by using a visual theme (the
   "Theme"). 3DS provides several Themes  through the Service; however,
   You can decide to create Your own Themes ("Your Themes") from Your
   Content by using the Theme editor tool.

   You shall not use Themes from third party websites to create Your
   Themes. Only Themes provided by 3DS and/or Themes created by other
   users can be posted and shared on the Ecosystem, to the exclusion of
   any other site or personal page.


3DS UWA

   3DS has opened its Service to publishers and developers to allow them
   to benefit from Our technology. 3DS Universal Widget API (the "UWA") is
   a computer program, published under a free license, enabling You to
   create Widgets compatible with multiple platforms (the "UWA Widgets").
   The use of UWA Widgets shall at all times comply with these Terms of
   Use.

   The majority of UWA Widgets run on multiple platforms. However, 3DS
   does not warrant that UWA Widgets will run on platforms other than the
   Website and may not be held liable for the compatibility (or absence
   thereof) of UWA Widgets with other platforms.


5. Publication of Your Content

   You may post and share Your Content by creating Your Public Page,
   and/or by posting Your Widget and/or Your Theme on the Ecosystem. You
   understand that any Content You may post on the Website is of Your sole
   and unique responsibility. This means that only You, and not 3DS, are
   responsible for all Content that You may upload, post, license,
   sublicense, display or otherwise make available via the Service or the
   Website. You also represent that You own all the rights to, or have
   secured the necessary authorizations for sharing Your Content. We do
   not control the Content posted by You via the Website or Service and,
   as such, may not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such
   Content or that it does not violate any laws or rights of others.

   You understand that You may not request any payment from 3DS for
   posting or sharing Your Widgets, Your Themes and/or Your Content on the
   Website.

   You remain the owner of the intellectual property rights pertaining to
   Your Content. The publication of Your Content via the Service in no way
   leads to a transfer of intellectual property rights benefiting 3DS or a
   third party, unless otherwise stipulated by these Terms of Use.

   By publishing Your Content via the Service and authorizing such
   publication by 3DS, You grant:

   (i) 3DS a worldwide, free, non-exclusive, assignable, transferable,
   sub-licensable license for the duration of protection of the
   intellectual property rights, to use, modify, adapt, publish,
   distribute, reproduce, represent, and display Your Content via the
   tService on all media and/or via all networks, by all presently known
   and/or unknown means, in every format, for advertising purposes, for
   promoting the Website and/or the Service, and for marketing and/or
   public relations purposes. If You disagree with any of the above, You
   shall not post Your Content (including Your Widgets and/or Your Themes)
   on the Ecosystem, nor on Your Public Page; (ii) all users visiting the
   Website and/or accessing the Service a worldwide free, non-exclusive,
   non-transferable and non-sublicensable, license for the duration of the
   intellectual property rights, to use, reproduce, represent, and display
   Your Content (limited to: Your Theme and/or Your Widget), on their own
   Private Dashboard for personal and noncommercial usages.

   You are and remain solely responsible for the Content published or
   circulated via the Service, and for its compliance with the applicable
   laws and regulations.

   As such, You should hold 3DS harmless against any recourse or action
   that could arise upon the exercise of the rights granted to 3DS and/or
   to the users by these Terms of Use, and any person who considers they
   have any of the rights to enforce all or part of the Content and/or its
   use by 3DS and/or the other users.

   Do not insert hyperlinks in Your Content linking to Third Party Content
   unless You have ensured that such Third Party Content complies with
   these Terms of Use.

   If You decide to access to social networks or to any other webservices
   (together, the “Webservices”) and/or use in any way the Webservices
   through Our Service, whether You have subscribed to the Paid Service or
   not, You acknowledge that Our Service is limited to providing access to
   the Webservices (and as such Third Party Content unbeknownst to 3DS
   available through the Webservices) through developer features and
   authorize 3DS to set Your account in conjunction with the use of such
   Webservices. You also agree:
     * to at all time comply with the Webservices’ applicable terms,
       including those for developer features, which You decide to access
       to and/or use through the Service and to be bound by them. These
       applicable terms may include for instance (but are not limited to)
       the Twitter Terms of Service made available at www.twitter.com/tos
     * not to use the Service to access or use the Webservices, and as
       such the Third Party Content available through them, for any
       prohibited or unlawful purposes as detailed in the Webservices’
       applicable terms, including those for developer features. For
       instance, You must comply with Section VII.A. User Protection of
       the Twitter Developer Agreement available at
       https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement
       providing, inter alia, that You must not use the Webservices for
       any discriminatory purposes or profiling based on sensitive
       categories of information prohibited by applicable laws;
     * that 3DS may monitor Your use of the Webservices in order to ensure
       compliance with Webservices’ applicable terms and, if necessary,
       may request You to justify in writing Your compliance with them. As
       such, access to Webservices through the Service may be limited and
       suspended at all time and without notice from 3DS during the time
       necessary to ensure compliance with Webservices’ applicable terms
       and/or terminated at all time from 3DS in case of non-compliance,
       without You being entitled to claim any compensation or indemnity
       from 3DS. In any case, You understand that access to the
       Webservices remains possible without using the Service;
     * that the access and use of the Webservices through the Service may
       be terminated at the sole discretion of the Webservices themselves,
       and without You being entitled to claim any compensation or
       indemnity from 3DS.

   You acknowledge, consent and agree that We may, without prior notice or
   compensation, (i) remove any content that violates the Terms of Use and
   that (ii) access, preserve and disclose Your account information, if
   any, and You Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith
   belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably
   necessary to:
     * Comply with legal obligations;
     * Enforce these Terms of Use;
     * Respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third
       parties; or
     * Protect the rights, property or personal safety of any person.

   When You visit the Website, use or buy the Service or send e-mails to

   You by e-mail or by posting notices on the Website.

   records, digital files, electronic communications conserved in 3DS’s
   computer systems, are considered evidence of the relationship and
   communication arising between 3DS and You in the context of the acces

   proceedings, will be admissible, valid, and opposable between the
   parties in the same way, in the same conditions, and with the same
   probative force as any document which may be established, received, or

   You may terminate Your use of the Service at any time and without
   notice by closing Your account.

   3DS may close Your account, suspend Your ability to use certain

   particular in view of the gravity of the violation, Your account may be

   the Additional Terms, You will no longer be able to access the Service
   as well as Your Content stored and/or published via the Service, nor

   responsibility to take the necessary measures to back up Your Content
   locally before termination, when this option is available.

   All assignments of rights to 3DS, warranty limitations, and liability
   limitations provided by these Terms of Use will remain in effect after

   accordance with the laws of France and any dispute arising out of or in
   connection with the use of the Website or the Service shall be brought
   before the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent Courts of Paris. You
   acknowledge and agree that the sentence immediately above shall not
   prevent, restrict or otherwise limit in any manner, 3DS's rights to
   seek equitable remedies, including injunctive relief before any
   competent court in any jurisdiction.

   If You are a consumer who do not act for professional or commercial
   purposes, then You may be able to refer a dispute to the European
   Online Dispute Resolution ("ODR") platform at http://ec.europa.eu/odr.
   The ODR platform is a web-based platform which is designed to help
   consumers who have bought goods or services online. It provides access
   to independent alternative dispute resolution which are usually free
   for You to use.

   Nothing in this paragraph shall deprive You of the right to bring or
   defend proceedings in Your home state if You are a consumer who do not
   act for professional or commercial purposes.


15. Miscellaneous

   You may benefit from additional rights according to mandatory laws of
   the country in which You have Your habitual residence. We do not intend
   to limit these rights beyond what is applicable according these
   mandatory provisions. You are responsible for checking that Your use of
   the Website and the Service comply with Your local laws.

   If a stipulation of these Terms of Use should be considered invalid or
   declared as such under any applicable law or regulation or following a
   definitive ruling by a competent jurisdiction, the other stipulations
   will retain their full force and effect.

   None of the parties may grant, transfer, or cede in any other way all
   or part of these Terms of Use, whether for reward or free of charge,
   without prior written permission from the other party. As an exception
   to the aforementioned, 3DS may freely grant, transfer, or cede in any
   other way all or part of these Terms of Use within the framework of a
   reorganization (this includes any merger, takeover, universal
   transmission of common property, sale, transfer or partial or total
   transfer of assets, and change in direct or indirect control).

     *  postal address
     *  email address
     *  telephone number(s)
     *  login and password
     * type of organization (company, school, university, etc.),
       organization name, organization size, department and job title;
     * people to whom purchases are shipped;
     * financial data (credit card number and expiry date, name and
       address of the cardholder);
     * IP address;
     * Cookies (as described in section 10); and
     * any other Personal Data as may be relevant for the purposes listed
       below.

   In all cases, however, the Personal Data gathered is limited to data
   necessary for the purposes described in Article 4 below.

   For visitors and users of the Site: In order to use certain functions
   and features of the Site, Dassault Systèmes requires that You provide
   certain Personal Data when visiting or using the Site. You are free to
   decide whether or not to provide all or part of Your Personal Data.
   However, if You choose not to provide all or part of this Personal
   Data, the purposes as described in Article 4 hereafter might not be
   achieved or not properly achieved, some areas and functions of the Site
   may not function properly and/or You may be refused access to certain
   pages on the Site. In particular, You will not be authorized to
   purchase other services via the Site.

   III.  Protection of personal data concerning children

   Dassault Systèmes services are not designed to be marketed to children
   who are considered as minor under the applicable data protection law
   and Dassault Systèmes does not knowingly collect or store Personal Data
   from children under such age.  For children whose usual place of
   residence is in the European Union, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland,
   the default age at which a person is no longer considered a child is 16
   subject to local law to adjust that limit between 13 and 16.

   Certain Dassault Systèmes services may be appropriate for use by
   children, however, in which case children below the age of consent
   under local data protection laws must seek consent from their parents
   or guardians prior to creating a Netvibes account or registering a
   product. Teachers and school administrators may act in the place of
   parents and guardians and provide consent for the collection of
   Personal Data from children (schools should always ensure that they
   have received permission from parents or guardians to do so).

   If parents or guardians become aware that their child has provided
   Dassault Systèmes with Personal Data without their consent or without a
   teacher’s or school administrator’s consent, they can ask Dassault
   Systèmes to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account
   by sending a request at http://www.netvibes.com/en/contact-us.

   If Dassault Systèmes becomes aware that it has collected Personal Data
   from a child below the age of consent under local data protection laws
   without consent from a parent or guardian, Dassault Systèmes will take
   steps to seek the parent’s or guardians consent for that processing or
   to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account.

   IV. Purposes and legal grounds for processing personal data

   grounds and for the following purposes:

            (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out
            herein and other information You provide about Your identity
            against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular

            updated or when You update Your information; (iii) blocking of

       contracts, orders, invoices, which may include conversational data
       triggered via chat functionalities on the Site, contact forms,
       emails, and voice messaging data; and
     * To provide You with commercial or support-type services.

   Generally, when consent is not required, You cannot opt out of
   non-marketing related communications that are required for the relevant
   business relationship. With regard to marketing-related communications
   (e.g., emails and phone calls), Dassault Systèmes will (i) where
   legally required, only send You such communications after you have
   opted in, and (ii) provide You the opportunity to opt out of receiving
   further marketing-related communications from Dassault Systèmes.

   Subject to applicable local law, by providing Personal Data such as but
   not limited to e-mail address, You hereby expressly authorize, Dassault
   Systèmes, which is part of a global group, and its affiliates (“3DS
   Group Companies”) to use it together with other relevant Personal Data
   to send You commercial or marketing communications.

   Dassault Systèmes might also use Your email address for administrative
   or other non-marketing purposes (for example, to notify You of
   significant changes to the Site).

   V. Personal data retention period

   Dassault Systèmes does not store Your Personal Data for more time than
   necessary. Retention periods may vary depending on the data categories
   and the processing activities.

   Where Dassault Systèmes is processing and using Your Personal Data as
   permitted by law or under your consent, Dassault Systèmes will store
   Your Personal Data (i) only as long as required to fulfill the purposes
   set out above, (ii) until You object to Dassault Systèmes’ use of your
   Personal Data (where Dassault Systèmes has a legitimate interest in
   using Your Personal Data), or (iii) where you gave Your consent, until
   you withdraw it. However, where Dassault Systèmes is required by
   applicable law to retain your Personal Data longer or where Your
   Personal Data is required to assert or defend against legal claims,
   Dassault Systèmes will retain Your Personal Data until the end of the
   relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been
   settled.

   Detailed information related to the different retention is available at
   http://faq.netvibes.com/knowledgebase/articles/1858447-personal-data-re
   t...

   VI. Transfer of personal data

   If You are accessing the Site from a location outside of the European
   Union, with laws or regulations governing data collection, use, and
   disclosure that differ from those of the European Union, please note
   that through Your continued use of the Site, which is governed by
   French law, the corresponding Terms of Services and this Privacy
   Policy, You are transferring Your Personal Data to the European Union
   and You consent to that transfer.

   As a member of a global group, Dassault Systèmes is able to use
   available technology to efficiently manage Personal Data and obtain
   such Personal Data online or otherwise throughout its affiliates’
   international operations.  Personal Data may be collected through the
   Site and subsequently disclosed to and used by a 3DS Group Company for
   the purposes stated in article 4 of this Privacy Policy.

   Please note that Dassault Systèmes may transfer Your Personal Data
   outside of the European Union, as long as before transferring Your
   Personal Data, Dassault Systèmes has ascertained that non-European
   Union entities, including 3DS Group Companies, offer an adequate level
   of protection in accordance with European legislation. 3DS Group
   Companies’ location is available at
   https://www.3ds.com/about-3ds/world-presence/.


   VII. Right to access, to rectification and other rights

   Dassault Systèmes will take reasonable steps to ensure that the
   Personal Data collected is used for the purposes stated in this Privacy
   Policy and that such Personal Data is correct and up to date.

   If You have an account, You have a right to access Your Personal Data.
   In addition, You have a right to request the rectification, completion,
   update or erasure of Your Personal Data by logging on to Your account.
   You have a right to restrict processing. You also have a right to
   obtain a copy of Your Personal Data stored by Dassault Systèmes. You
   have a right to object, in relation to specific processing of Your
   Personal Data. Additionally, You may have a right to data portability.
   Otherwise, You may exercise Your rights by sending a request
   at http://www.netvibes.com/en/contact-us

   Depending on the scope of the request, Dassault Systèmes reserves the
   right to charge a reasonable fee to cover any out-of-pocket costs
   incurred in connection with such access, modification and deletion of
   Personal Data.  Dassault Systèmes may deny access to Personal Data in
   limited circumstances, defined by applicable laws and regulations.

   VIII. Data recipients

   Your Personal Data may be disclosed to and used by a 3DS Group Company
   for the purposes stated in Article 4 of this Privacy Policy.

   Where Dassault Systèmes has knowledge that a third party to which
   Dassault Systèmes has provided Personal Data for the purposes listed in
   Article 4 above, is using or disclosing Personal Data contrary to this
   Privacy Policy or to applicable laws, Dassault Systèmes will take
   reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure. Dassault
   Systèmes will also disclose Personal Data to third parties if Dassault
   Systèmes determines that such disclosure is necessary for technical
   reasons (such as hosting services by a third party) or to protect
   Dassault Systèmes’ legal interests (such as in the event of sale of
   assets to a third company, or change of control or total or partial
   liquidation of Dassault Systèmes).

   Dassault Systèmes may also disclose Your Personal Data if required by
   law or if Dassault Systèmes believes in good faith that such disclosure
   is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (for example, a
   warrant, a subpoena, or other court order) or protect the rights,
   property, or personal safety of Dassault Systèmes, our customers, or
   the public.

   If allowed by applicable law, Dassault Systèmes may also share Your
   Personal Data with third parties in order to offer You targeted
   marketing or advertising.


   IX. Data security

   Dassault Systèmes undertakes to ensure the protection and security of
   Personal Data that You choose to communicate, in order to ensure the
   confidentiality of Your Personal Data and prevent Your Personal Data
   from being distorted, damaged, destroyed or disclosed to unauthorized
   parties.

   Dassault Systèmes maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and
   procedural safeguards to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and
   unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. As part of
   those safeguards, Dassault Systèmes employs sophisticated technology
   designed to protect Personal Data during its transmission and prevent
   transmission errors or unauthorized acts of third parties. However,
   while Dassault Systèmes strives to protect Your Personal Data, in light
   of the inevitable risks of data transmission over the internet,
   Dassault Systèmes cannot guarantee full protection against any error
   occurring during the course of Personal Data transmission, which is
   beyond Dassault Systèmes' reasonable control.

   Since all Personal Data is confidential, access is limited to
   employees, contractors and agents of 3DS Group Companies who have a
   need to know such data in carrying out their tasks. All the people who
   have access to Your Personal Data are bound by a duty of
   confidentiality and subject to disciplinary actions and/or other
   sanctions if they fail to meet these obligations.

   However, it is important for You to exercise caution to prevent
   unauthorized access to Your Personal Data. You are responsible for the
   confidentiality of Your password and information appearing on Your
   account. Consequently, You must ensure that You log out of Your session
   in the event of shared use of a computer.


   X. COOKIES

   The Site may use cookies or other technologies serving the same or
   similar purpose (together referred to as “cookies”), that may collect
   or store Personal Data. Cookies are text files stored and used to
   record Non-Personal and Personal Data concerning Your browsing and use
   of the Site. Cookies can be either persistent (i.e. remain after You
   logoff from the Site in order to be used on Your subsequent visits to
   the Site) or transient (i.e., removed when You close the web browser).

   The table available at
   http://faq.netvibes.com/knowledgebase/articles/1858438-cookies-we-use
   provides You with the list of cookies Dassault Systèmes uses, their
   retention period and their purpose.

   Dassault Systèmes uses cookies in order to:
     * improve Your user experience through, for example:
          + enabling a service to recognize your device so You don't have
            to give the same information several times during one task;
          + recognizing that You may already have given a username and
            password so you don't need to do so for every web page
            requested;
     * analyze traffic and data on the Site to:
          + measure how many people are using the Site, so the Site can be
            made easier to use and navigate and to make sure there is
            enough capacity to ensure the Site has adequate response
            times;
          + help Dassault Systèmes understand how users interact with the
            Site so Dassault Systèmes can improve its functionality and
            performance.

   Dassault Systèmes may also use third party services (such as Adobe
   Analytics, Google Analytics, Piwik, DART, LinkedIn) to perform services
   on its behalf, in particular to:
     * analyze Your browsing habits and measure the Site audience,
     * analyze Your interests and offer You targeted marketing or
       advertising,
     * allow You to share content from the services with other people on
       social networks or to let these other people know what You are
       looking at or what You think (e.g., the “Like” button on Facebook),
     * analyze the effectiveness of the Site

   In such a case, invisible pixels and cookies provided by such third
   party vendors may be used. By transmitting the information generated by
   these cookies, the cookies’ settings ensure that an IP address is
   anonymized before geo-localization and before storage. Our providers
   will use this information for the evaluation of Your use of the Site,
   compiling reports on the Site activity for Dassault Systèmes, to
   propose better services to You that are suited to Your needs, and
   display advertisements You that are suited to Your needs. Cookies will
   not associate Your IP address with any other data they hold.

   When you browse the Site, cookies are enabled by default and data may
   be read from or stored locally on your device if your browser settings
   allow. You will be notified of the use of cookies the first time You
   access the Site with a device;  Dassault Systèmes will not install any
   cookies before obtaining your explicit consent. You may decide to
   accept or refuse some or all cookies. You can configure Your browser
   software to refuse all cookies (including cookies used for web
   analytics services); if You do so, however, some areas and features of
   the Site may not function properly and/or You may not be able to access
   some parts or services of the Site.

   All browsers offer configuration options to:
     * inform You of the cookies saved on your computer;
     * allow You to accept or refuse them

   You have the possibility to manage parameters and choose whether to
   accept certain cookies while on the Site. For more information, please
   read
   http://faq.netvibes.com/knowledgebase/articles/1858441-how-to-turn-off-
   cookies

   XI. Links to websites not controlled by Dassault Systèmes

   This Site might offer links to third party Websites that may be of
   interest to You.

   Unless Dassault Systèmes receives Your express authorization, Dassault
   Systèmes does not share any Personal Data with these third parties.
   However, Dassault Systèmes may provide them with Non-Personal Data.

   Dassault Systèmes does not exercise any control over the content of
   third party Websites or the practices of these third parties in
   connection with the protection of Personal Data that they might collect
   and are thus not under the control of Dassault Systèmes. Consequently,
   Dassault Systèmes declines all liability for the content of third party
   websites or the practices of these third parties concerning the
   protection of Personal Data.

   It is therefore Your responsibility to inform yourself as to these
   third parties' privacy policies.

   XII. Dispute resolution

   Although Dassault Systèmes has put in place reasonable safeguards to
   protect Personal Data, Dassault Systèmes recognizes that there is no
   method of transmitting or storing Personal Data that is completely
   secure.

   However, Dassault Systèmes is committed to ensure the privacy of
   Personal Data: if You have a reason to believe that the security of
   Your Personal Data has been compromised or misused, You should contact
   Dassault Systèmes by sending a request
   at http://www.netvibes.com/en/contact-us.

   Dassault Systèmes will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints
   regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the
   principles contained in this Privacy Policy.

   Unauthorized access to Personal Data or the improper use of Personal
   Data may constitute offenses under local law.

   If Your usual place of residence is in European Union, Lichtenstein,
   Norway or Iceland, You have a right to file a complaint with Your
   competent data protection authority.

   XIII. Contact

   For any additional question concerning this Privacy Policy, to opt out
   of receiving information from Dassault Systèmes or any request
   regarding Your rights in Your Personal Data You may contact Dassault
   Systèmes by sending a request at http://www..com/en/contact-us.

   Please note that you may also contact 3DS Data Protection Officer via
   the following address: 3DS.Compliance-Privacy@3ds.com.

   XIII. Date of entry into force of the privacy policy and changes to it

   This Privacy Policy may be updated according to Dassault Systèmes'
   requirements and circumstances, or where required by applicable laws
   and regulations so please check back periodically for updates.
