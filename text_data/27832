   “A continuous process that I could completely leave on autopilot.”

   Patrick McLoughlin, Eventbrite

Cloud based, lightning fast

   Source content and translations are automatically synced to a global
   content repository that’s accessible any time. Various teams work and
   communicate directly in Transifex with translators and project managers
   from any vendor.

   WORKFLOWS

   Translation vendors, project management, translation tools and more
   help you build your custom workflow.
   [home-visual-mobile.svg]

An open, connected platform

   Transifex integrates with your development process, apps, service
   providers, and CMS – instead of forcing you into an All-In-One mold.
   Use with agencies, translators, or even crowdsource your translations –
   we NEVER lock you in.
   [home-open-visual.png]

Continuous, agile localization

   Translators work on live content in the development cycle, allowing for
   languages to keep up with English updates, eliminating the need for
   long string freezes or translation in big batches.

   "Transifex fits our needs both on the development side, allowing us to
   stay agile when it comes to localization, and on the translation side,
   allowing us to stay focused on localization.”
