   What are the real benefits of Kubernetes

WHAT ARE THE REAL BENEFITS OF KUBERNETES

Sardonic, you doubt: “It has no competitors?”

   You will sometimes read that Kubernetes is the “Linux of Cloud“. This
   assertion, in addition to displacing the importance of the Operating
   System in the IT to the orchestrator, also points out that, as with the
   O.S., an orchestrator’s war is raging. Or rather should we say “was”
   raging.

   Solutions such as Docker Swarm, Apache Marathon, Nomad HashiCorp, Red
   Hat OpenShift, Kontena have long fought for a slice of the pie. Each
   with its strengths. But when, starting in 2017, more and more important
   companies have chosen Kubernetes for their modernization, naturally
   followed by the biggest players in the Cloud (and their ecosystem) a
   critical threshold has been crossed. Kubernetes won the war. He became
   factually the standard orchestrator.

Sly, you retort, “So, why Kubernetes rather than any other?”

   First, because Kubernetes has a proven maturity and is based on a
   robust architecture. With more than 10 years of development and use,
   the solution is proven. At Google, it manages the approximately 2
   billion instantiated containers each week for all of the group’s
   services – arguably the largest container platform in the world.

   Then, the community and the industry support it massively. Its
   adoption, support and popularity are unmatched in its market. It is
   estimated today that nearly 70% of companies have chosen Kubernetes to
   orchestrate their containerized architecture. This is what animate a
   community (Devs and Ops :)) and an ecosystem (publishers and hosts)
   perennial, right?

   Compared to its competitors, Kubernetes brings natively a wide range of
   supported features and applications. It supports a variety of typical
   workloads (stateless, stateful, batch, and deamons), languages, and
   frameworks. Flexibility that will suit many usage scenarios.

   Finally, with his particularly active community (more than 2,000 Github
   contributors, from the independent developer to the Fortune 500
   organization engineer), Kubernetes is continually growing. You will
   always find help for your project!

Convinced, you say: “What benefits for my company?”

   With Kubernetes, enterprises deploy and operate cloud-native
   applications, regardless of the environment and underlying
   infrastructure. It is the ideal solution for all stages of the
   integrated software industry: developments, tests and production.
   Kubernetes gives users the ability to tailor application resources to a
   much lighter and more powerful system than virtual machines.

   Therefore, the periods of unavailability due to maintenance (and all
   the anxiety that accompanies it) are over; over the multiplication of
   databases (and associated servers) hosting libraries, binaries and
   other drivers (only images Dockerfiles must be stored). Finally, the
   heavy dependencies between virtualized systems are over. For each
   microservice, development teams can confidently use container images on
   their own machines.

   With Kubernetes, you get:
     * In speed: your ability to provide new code to your users depends
       only on your ability to think it.
     * In efficiency: associated with the deep nature of the containers
       (portability, immutability, resilience, decoupling); the fine
       management provided by Kubernetes makes it possible to densify the
       population of your machines (On premise and Cloud) without impact
       for the applications which cohabit there.
     * In budget: with equal number of applications, you operate (and
       finance) less machines.

Motivated, you start: “How do I start?”

   In terms of containers and orchestrators, technologies, security, roles
   are new and in motion. They must be approached methodically. On its
   own, Kubernetes will not make you a champion of agility. In addition to
   the tools it provides, a successful modernization requires:
     * A global strategy: Containerization must be part of a genuine
       desire for transformation that will achieve the level of agility
       that not only offers the speed and adaptability imposed by
       fast-changing business but also the expected reduction in costs.
       development, maintenance, and operation.
     * Realistic opportunities: If, in some cases, deploying a monolithic
       application in the form of containers orchestrated by Kubernetes
       can make sense, one must not lose sight of the fact that not
       everything is “containerizable”.
     * Mastery of DevOps culture: the development of container-based
       microservices imposes a discipline and good practices that are
       often poorly understood. Better to bet on real expertise!

   There is no need to embark on a total and irreversible modernization of
   its IS in container / devops mode.

   If many organizations are considering a redesign of the architecture by
   cutting the monolithic application by “roles” to convert them into
   microservices; another, more pragmatic approach exists. On the basis of
   scalability criteria or features that are likely to evolve rapidly and
   / or regularly, companies can first identify the business segments that
   would benefit from being detached from the monolith to place them in
   containers.

   An approach that promotes rapid success and a more immediate return on
   investment without preventing the company from progressively evolving
   towards the DevOps philosophy and an advanced culture of microservices.
