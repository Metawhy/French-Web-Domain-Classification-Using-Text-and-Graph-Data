Lara Wagner

   Seismic waves flow through Earth’s solid and liquid material
   differently, allowing Earth scientists to determine various aspects of
   the composition of the Earth’s interior. Broadband seismology looks at
   a broad spectrum of waves for high-resolution imaging. Lara Wagner
   collects this data from continental areas of the planet that have not
   been studied before to better understand the elastic properties of
   Earth’s crust and upper mantle, the rigid region called the
   lithosphere.

   By its nature seismology is indirect research and has limitations for
   interpreting features like temperature, melting, and exact composition.
   So Wagner looks at the bigger picture. She integrates her data with
   mineral physics and geochemistry, putting her seismological results in
   the broader geological context.

   In addition to her observational work, Wagner is involved in developing
   new seismometer technologies and strategies to improve the quality of
   data. She is the newest Carnegie Earth scientist joining the staff the
   fall of 2014. However, she is not new to Carnegie. She was a
   postdoctoral fellow from 2005 to 2007.

   Before joining Carnegie as a staff member Wagner was an associate
   professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of
   North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She received her B.A. in history and
   sociology at Columbia University and her Ph. D. at the University of
   Arizona. She received the American Geophysical Union’s Outstanding
   Student Paper Award in 2004; she won the Walter H. Wheeler Faculty
   Teaching Award in 2012; and was the Incorporated Research Institutions
   of Seismology/Seismology Society of America Distinguished Lecturer in
   2013. For more information see

Carnegie’s Patrick McCarthy, Giant Magellan Telescope Vice President,
appointed director of NSF’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research
Laboratory

   Carnegie astronomer and Vice President of the Giant Magellan Telescope
   (GMT), Patrick McCarthy, has been appointed as the first Director of
   the National Science Foundation’s newly formed National
   Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NSF’s OIR Lab).
   McCarthy has been a member of the GMT project since its inception 15
   years ago, helping to bring it from a sketch on a napkin to a 100-plus
   person organization with 12 U.S. and international partners. In 2008,
   20 years into his tenure at Carnegie, McCarthy officially expanded his
   role when he accepted his current leadership position at GMT.

   opportunity to “skip traditional post-doctoral training and move

Possible therapeutic target for slow healing of aged muscles discovered

   An age-related decline in recovery from muscle injury can be traced to
   a protein that suppresses the special ability of muscle stem cells to
   build new muscles, according to work from a team of current and former
   Carnegie biologists led by Chen-Ming Fan and published in Nature
   Metabolism.

Many gas giant exoplanets waiting to be discovered

   There is an as-yet-unseen population of Jupiter-like planets orbiting
   nearby Sun-like stars, awaiting discovery by future missions like
   NASA’s WFIRST space telescope, according to new models of gas giant
   planet formation by Carnegie’s Alan Boss described in an upcoming
   publication in The Astrophysical Journal.  His models are supported by
   a new Science paper on the surprising discovery of a gas giant planet
   orbiting a low-mass star.

Found: “Poster child” for being shredded by a black hole

   NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has for the first
   time seen the aftermath of a star that was violently ripped apart by a
   supermassive black hole. Catching such a rare event in action will help
   astronomers understand these mysterious phenomena.  The observation is
   reported by a team of astronomers led by Carnegie’s Thomas Holoien, who
   is a founding member of the international network of telescopes that
   made the discovery—the Ohio State University based All-Sky Automated
   Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN).

Carnegie celebrates National Postdoc Appreciation Week

   At Carnegie, we know it's crucially important to acknowledge the
   efforts of our postdocs throughout the year. We recognize that they
   bring creative energy, new opportunities for collaboration, and fresh
   research ideas to our campuses, and that their continued
   excellence burnishes Carnegie's reputation when they go out into the
   world. This is why we always celebrate National Postdoc Appreciation
   Week.

A “GPS” to guide the discovery of new materials

   When considering the synthesis of new structures, some of the possible
   spatial configurations of atoms are energetically favorable—meaning
   they are easy to maintain—and others are more difficult. Picture these
   energy states as hills that must be surmounted and valleys that can be
   coasted through effortlessly. What if there were a kind of a GPS that
   would improve the ability of scientists to navigate through these
   different states and predict the best routes for obtaining a particular
   material?

Predicting the mutations plants need to survive climate change

   Plant genetic diversity in Central Europe could collapse due to
   temperature extremes and drought brought on by climate change,
   according to a new paper in Nature led by Moises Exposito-Alonso, who
   joins Carnegie next month. Because only a few individuals of a species
   are already adapted to extreme climate conditions, the overall species
   genetic diversity could be greatly diminished, according to the team's
   findings.

Would a carbon tax help to innovate more-efficient energy use?

   Taxing carbon emissions would drive innovation and lead to improved
   energy efficiency, according to a new paper from Carnegie and the
   University of Waterloo. It has long been theorized that raising carbon
   prices would provide an incentive to reduce emissions. To investigate
   this question, the research team looked at historical data to determine
   how cost increases have affected energy use efficiency in the past.

The results are in! Jovian moon-naming contest winners announced

   From February to April, we solicited name suggestions for five recently
   discovered moons of Jupiter and the submissions ranged from the
   scholarly to the silly. We combed through them all—even the ones that
   blatantly disregarded the rules—and passed the best ones on to the
   International Astronomical Union. Today, the IAU is publishing the
   winners.

Carnegie-led initiative receives major DOE biofuels research grant

   Carnegie plant biologists Sue Rhee and David Ehrhardt will lead one of
   25 teams awarded a total of $64 million this week by the U.S.
   Department of Energy to pursue genomic research of potential biofuel
   crops. “This study will be the first of its kind, revealing the full
   suite of a plant’s metabolic enzymes and their relationships to each
   other inside a living cell,” said Rhee of the project, which will map
   the metabolic networks of he cereal plant sorghum, which is also a
   biofuel crop, and the wheat relative Brachypodium, which is a model
   organism for grasses, including those that are used for biofuels.

How do you forecast eruptions at volcanoes that sit “on the cusp” for
decades?

   Some volcanoes take their time—experiencing protracted, years-long
   periods of unrest before eventually erupting. This makes it difficult
   to forecast when they pose a danger to their surrounding areas, but
   Carnegie’s Diana Roman and Penn State’s Peter LaFemina are trying to
   change that.
