   Privacy Notice

Updated August 8, 2019

   ShareThis takes privacy seriously.  This Privacy Notice sets out what
   data we collect, how we collect it, why we process it, who we may share
   it with and, where the data we collect is personal data, your rights
   with respect to such personal data. ShareThis may change this Notice
   from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page
   from time to time to ensure that you are up to date with any changes.

   ShareThis is committed to processing information in accordance with
   applicable laws (including where applicable the European Union’s
   General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and as described in this
   Privacy Notice. For specific information about how ShareThis adheres to
   the GDPR and your rights as an EEA data subject please see below.

About ShareThis and its Tools

   ShareThis provides website operators (“Publishers”) with customizable
   social sharing tools, which makes sharing online content simple. Any
   user of a website can easily share anything on the web with their
   friends on social sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Email, Digg, Reddit
   and more through using one of our tools on that website (“ShareThis
   Icon”).

   ShareThis also collects data about internet users and how they interact
   with content, websites and adverts which enables ShareThis and our
   Publishers, advertisers, customers and data partners to facilitate the
   delivery of relevant, targeted advertising online to these groups. We
   also carry out analytics and provide insights to understand internet
   users’ behaviour and improve the effectiveness of online content and
   advertising, based on such browsing, sharing, and what is considered to
   be the profile of that group.

   We do this by using technology such as cookies and pixels (including
   pixels and cookies for our customers) (“ShareThis Publisher
   Applications”) to gather information regarding the browsing and sharing
   activities of internet users, both on websites that use our ShareThis
   Icon and other websites which have our technology installed on them. We
   also receive data from others who operate in the data analytics and
   advertising industries. We analyse and aggregate the data we collect to
   create groups of data (called audience segments) based on defined
   criteria.  For example, we segment into groups internet users who we
   believe have similar characteristics, interests, needs or behavioral
   patterns. Where we are able to infer that two or more browsers or
   devices are the same user or household, we may use that information to
   bolster our audience segments.

   Targeted advertising has the aim of displaying advertising which is
   more likely to be of interest to internet users, based on analyses of
   their recent browsing and sharing activities and interactions with the
   website and adverts. It is also sometimes referred to as interest-based
   advertising or online behavioural advertising. For more information on
   this type of advertising, click here.

Data Collection and Use

   In order to offer our products and services, we collect and use data
   relating to the websites you visit to display personalized
   advertisements, provide analytics, and data modeling based on social
   sharing, by us or third parties. This data is pseudonymous in that it
   may not be used directly by ShareThis to identify an actual person.
   This data does enable our systems to recognize your computer, device
   and/or browser over time.

   In many places, this data is considered personal data as it relates to
   an identified or identifiable natural person.

   We do not intentionally collect contact information such as your name,
   address, phone number, address, credit card information, or anything
   else that can allow us or our customers to contact you directly as part
   of our products and services. We may collect such information if you
   are one of our Publishers or if you have a business relationship with
   ShareThis.
   Additional Information

   We have set out below the categories of data we process and why we
   process each category of data.

   1.Usage Data and Profile Information

   1.1 Usage Data

   We collect information about how internet users browse the internet and
   interact with online content and advertisements through our ShareThis
   Icon, the ShareThis Publisher Applications and user interactions with
   advertisements on the internet. We call this “Usage Data”.

   Usage Data includes:
     * the unique IDs of the cookie(s) placed on your web browser
       (example: 37d387ca-f68a-11e5-b87d-0e58954c72b1)
     * Information about the user’s browser and device
     * Webpages viewed (including the URL addresses of such pages and
       search parameters, which may include search terms and key words)
       and the previous web pages that referred the user to that webpage
     * Time when webpages are viewed
     * Search queries from which users are directed to a webpage
     * Navigation from page to page
     * Time spent on each webpage
     * Interactions with the webpage, including items clicked or selected
       and content highlighted or copied
     * Ads viewed or displayed to the user and the user’s interactions
       with those ads
     * Shares of content including what content is shared and where – for
       example, the relevant social media site (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)
     * Geographic information such as country, city, state or postal code.
     * IP addresses
     * Device IDs

   Although the Usage Data listed above is not used by ShareThis to
   directly identify an actual person, it is considered to be personal
   data in many places.

   1.2 Profile Information

   We receive information about the content of the websites that you visit
   and information about the audience of those websites to enable us to
   infer and create groups of users who have similar characteristics,
   interests or behavioral patterns. We combine the Usage Data with data
   we receive from third party advertisers, analytics vendors and data
   partners to create categories of data that are helpful to advertisers
   seeking to deliver a more personalized advertising experience. For
   example, if a user regularly views or shares content about shopping for
   a car, our systems may infer that this user may be interested in
   purchasing an automobile.  This practice is sometimes referred to as
   interest based advertising, and a segment titled “interested in
   automobile” is sometimes referred to as an audience segment or a
   “profile.” When we group this data into profiles, we refer to it as
   “Profile Information”.

   We can infer this Profile Information (by reference to browser
   identifiers, not actual names) using the information we obtain from
   third parties about the likely content and characteristics of the users
   and audiences of the websites which are visited. For example, users of
   a particular website may have an interest in cars and typically be
   within a certain age or income range. Where we are able to infer that
   two or more browsers or devices are the same user or household, we may
   use that information to bolster our Profile Information.

   The characteristics by which we group users relate to age ranges,
   income ranges, education, gender, ethnicity and family composition, on
   the basis of the typical audience of websites they visit and content
   viewed.

   If you would like to see a sample of the types of Profile Information
   used by ShareThis, please click here.

   1.3 How we obtain Usage Data and Profile Information

   We collect Usage Data when your device visits our website, uses or
   interacts with our services (including sharing content with the
   ShareThis Icon), when your device visits Publishers’ websites that use
   ShareThis Publisher Applications, and when your device views or clicks
   advertisements that we serve or are served on our behalf.  We do so by
   using cookies placed on your browser, pixel tags, and HTTP headers (or
   other communication protocols).

   Our use of Cookies and other Tracking Technologies

   Web Environment: (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)

   ShareThis uses browser cookies to “tag” visitors on the websites that
   use ShareThis Publisher Applications. These users are given a technical
   identifier, such as C62414AY9324FB5671069928026P0067.

   This browser cookie tracks the user’s browsing data. Pixel tags are
   then used to transfer this browsing data to ShareThis and our customers
   and data partners.

   Cookies: Small text files that contain a string of characters and
   uniquely identify a browser. Cookies are installed on a browser by the
   publisher of a website as well by third parties who do not operate the
   website but whose pixel tags (described below) are found on the
   website. ShareThis cookies and cookies of our customers are third party
   cookies, and these are installed in user browsers by the ShareThis
   Publisher Applications which are on Publishers’ websites. Many browsers
   are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you may be able to
   change your browser settings to refuse third-party cookies. Check your
   browser’s “Help” files to learn more about handling cookies on your
   browser.

   Pixel tags: These are small blocks of code on a webpage which read and
   place cookies. When you visit a webpage, ShareThis’ pixel will see if
   your browser has a ShareThis cookie installed on it. If it doesn’t, the
   pixel will install the cookie. If it does, the pixel will “read” the
   cookie and will send us information such as the time you viewed a
   webpage, the type of browser used and your IP address. This is how we
   learn about your interests and enable our customers to deliver targeted
   advertising to you.

   HTTP headers: These are transmitted whenever a webpage is viewed, and
   contain technical information required to connect your browser to the
   webpage. This information may include information about the browser and
   the requested webpage. ShareThis collects this information.

   Other Environments: (Mobile applications)

   To serve ads in mobile applications identifiers may be used, such as
   Google Advertising ID or Apple IDFA, depending on the operating system
   of your mobile device. The advertiser identifier identifies your device
   but not you directly and can be reset by you. See your device
   manufacturer for more information or visit NAI Mobile opt-out page at
   https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice/
   .

   Linking Environments: (browsers and mobile apps used)

   To serve you personalized advertisements and provide a seamless online
   experience, third party data partners that we work with may link your
   identifiers on the different environments you use. We may enable the
   linking of our Usage Data through cookie syncing. We do not use plain
   text information that may be used by ShareThis to identify you such as
   your name or address to operate the linking. Our data partners may use
   exact linking methods by leveraging the pseudonymous data collected
   through our technology such as advertising partner identifiers.

   You can manage cookies, change consents or opt out of personalized ads
   using the mechanisms described in ‘User Choices’.

   1.4 How we use Usage Data and Profile Information

   We use Usage Data and Profile Information to enable the delivery of
   targeted advertising using cookies or similar tracking technologies
   described above.

   Our customers who we share your data with may use this information to
   generate their own Profile Information. They may independently gain
   other demographical information about you through their own cookies or
   web beacons and combine it with the data we provide to them. The use of
   cookies and pixel tags by these third-party advertisers, publishers,
   and ad networks are subject to their own privacy policies.   Please
   refer to the ‘Recipients of Your Data’ section of this Privacy Notice
   for more information about who we disclose your data to.

   2. Children

   ShareThis does not intentionally collect data from children and does
   not tailor any Profile Information to enable targeting of children
   under 16 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we
   may be processing data of children you are responsible for, please see
   the section on User Choices and Rights, or contact us directly.

   3. Emails from Users with ShareThis Icon

   When you share to email with the ShareThis Icon, you choose how to
   connect to email from your device. We will only know what content you
   shared, and that you did so by means of email. We do not receive any
   information about the email itself, for example, your email address,
   the email address of the recipient or the content of your email. We are
   not responsible for the information shared by users via the ShareThis
   Publisher Applications.

   4. Account Information

   “Account Information” means the information which Publishers and
   representatives of Publishers provide when they register for an account
   with us and when they use their account.

   Many of our services can be used without registering with us. However
   if you are a Publisher, or represent a Publisher, and want to use some
   of our enhanced features, you will need to register with us.

   If you choose to register with us, you must be and you affirm that you
   are 16 years of age or older. We do not sell or share registration
   information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.

   5. Business contacts data

   We may process your personal data if you are or your employer has a
   business relationship with us. You could be a customer, supplier, or a
   prospect (e.g. a Publisher, a data provider, a social media platform,
   an agency, an advertiser etc.). The personal data we hold about you
   refers to your professional life (name, email address, billing address,
   office address, phone numbers, title, company you work for). We would
   have collected that information from exchanging emails or business
   cards, meeting at industry meetings or client sessions etc. We may
   process that data for a number of legitimate business purposes,
   including: a) to communicate with you within the context of our
   business relationship; b) to provide our products or services; c) for
   billing and invoicing purposes; and d) for sales, marketing and product
   promotional purposes.

   This data may also be processed for the purposes set out in the section
   ‘General purposes which apply to all data.’

   6. Employee and Job Applicants’ data

   If you are an employee of ShareThis, or you apply for a role with
   ShareThis, in the US or in Europe, please refer to our HR Policy for
   information about how we process your data. These can be obtained from
   our HR department at HR@ShareThis.com.

   7. Data Collected on ShareThis.com

   This section sets out how we process data of visitors of our corporate
   website (ShareThis.com), apart from the ‘Usage Data and Profile
   Information’ collected on ShareThis.com and the ‘Account Information’
   which relates only to Publishers who register with us.

   When you visit our website, you may choose to provide information to us
   voluntarily if you interact with ShareThis.com in certain ways, such as
   by applying for employment with ShareThis, or using one of our contact
   forms. This information is used only for the reasons for which it was
   collected, such as responding to your communication, and it is not
   shared with third parties other than to fulfill the purpose for which
   it was collected.

   We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect data
   automatically when you visit ShareThis.com and use that information to
   help administer the website, to remember your preferences, to conduct
   website analytics and for security and fraud prevention purposes.

   This Privacy Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of other
   websites or of third parties who collect information on ShareThis.com.
   We encourage you to visit the applicable policies of those third
   parties, or visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about interest-based
   advertising and to see your opt-out choices from other participating
   companies that may be collecting and using data on ShareThis.com.

   8. General purposes which apply to all data

   There are a number of “general” reasons that ShareThis may process data
   on our systems. Many of them are required by applicable law and/or to
   help us ensure that the Internet remains a safe space. Some of them
   enable us to promote and grow our business. If you’d like additional
   information, please email privacy@sharethis.com.

   We may also process data for the following purposes: a) as required by
   applicable law; b) to cooperate with competent legal authorities such
   as data protection regulators, the police and the FBI; c) to enforce
   our terms and conditions, including by obtaining advice and conducting
   legal proceedings; d) to protect our operations, property and
   interests, and those of third parties; e)  to sell and promote the sale
   of our business and/or assets.

   Finally, ShareThis may transfer information to a successor entity in
   connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets,
   bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If ShareThis is involved in a
   merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you
   will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of
   any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any
   choices you may have regarding your information.

The GDPR and Your Rights as an EU Data Subject

   If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General
   Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to our processing of personal
   data. The GDPR grants those located in the EEA a set of clear privacy
   rights and imposes responsibilities on ShareThis as we process the
   personal data of data subjects located in the EEA. The ShareThis
   privacy policy outlines how and why ShareThis processes personal data.
   This EU privacy section is designed to provide more information on how
   ShareThis adheres to the GDPR and your rights as a data subject located
   in the EEA.
   Additional Information

   Definition of Personal Data

   The GDPR defines personal data broadly. As such, where Usage Data
   and/or Profile Information relates to an individual in the EEA, we
   treat it as personal data and comply with the GDPR when processing such
   data. Similarly, nearly all of the data collected from EU data subjects
   in the context of our normal business operations is likely to be
   considered personal data. This includes: a) data collected via visits
   to ShareThis.com; b) data collected from Customers, Publishers and
   business partners; and c) data collected from employees and prospective
   employees.

   Special Categories of Personal Data

   ShareThis does not collect nor process any special categories of
   personal data with respect to EU data subjects, and we do not create
   Profile Information of audience segments of EU consumers based on
   special categories of personal data (i.e. data revealing racial or
   ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,
   or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data
   concerning health, or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or
   sexual orientation).

   Legal Basis for Processing

   The GDPR requires entities seeking to process EU personal data to have
   a valid legal basis for doing so. The legal basis utilized by ShareThis
   include: a) consent; b) legitimate interest (i.e., where we believe
   that our need to process the data and/or the value we deliver by
   processing such data is not outweighed by the rights of the data
   subject); c) where necessary for the performance of a contract; and d)
   where processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations. We
   will endeavor to outline our legal basis for the most common types of
   processing conducted by ShareThis.

   Cookie and Similar Tracking Technologies – We endeavor to obtain
   consent for our placement of cookies, pixels and similar tracking
   technologies as required under the ePrivacy Directive as implemented
   throughout the EEA. As ShareThis does not have direct relationships
   with Internet users in many cases, we ask Publishers and other partners
   to obtain a consent on our behalf as described below.  Where we
   directly place cookies (e.g., via ShareThis.com) we directly obtain the
   consent from data subjects we’ve identified as being from the EEA.

   Usage Data and Profile Information – While we obtain a consent for our
   placement of cookies as described above, ShareThis processes Usage Data
   and Profile Information under our legitimate interest. For purposes of
   clarity, where this data is utilized for analytics, targeted
   advertising, measurement or reporting, we also process it via
   legitimate interest. To offer additional transparency, we endeavor to
   mention some of these use cases in the consents obtained for cookies
   and pixels.

   Website Data – We collect personal data via ShareThis.com. Where that
   data is provided to ShareThis (e.g., via completing an online form), we
   consider it either Account Data and/or data collected pursuant to a
   Business Relationship which are described below. Where we place cookies
   via the website, we use consent. Where data is collected automatically
   (e.g., log files containing IP addresses), we process such data via our
   legitimate interest and in order to maintain the website and help us to
   a better job of personalizing the website to the interests of visitors.

   Account Data and Business Relationships – We require some Publishers to
   setup an Account with ShareThis. Similarly, we maintain accounts
   containing personal data with most of the vendors who provide services
   to ShareThis, our Customers, our employees and our business partners.
   If you are an employee of one of those entities, ShareThis may have
   your personal data including your name, your work email or your work
   telephone number. For data subjects located in the EEA, we process this
   data under the legal basis of contractual necessity. In other words, we
   need to process this data in order to honor the terms of the contract
   between ShareThis and the Publisher, Customer, vendor, Etc. This
   includes maintaining an account and login credentials, billing and
   payment purposes, communicating with the other party, and fulfilling
   requests. Where we are seeking to market additional products and
   services to these entities, we will do so via legitimate interest
   unless applicable law dictates that we use consent (e.g., for email
   marketing).

   General Purposes – There are a number of instances where ShareThis
   processes personal data which are distinct from the descriptions
   provided above. For example:

   Legal and Regulatory Compliance – Like most companies, ShareThis will
   process data in order to comply with law, cooperate with requests from
   competent legal authorities such as the police, and to pay taxes. The
   legal basis for this type of processing is necessary for ShareThis to
   meet our legal and regulatory obligations.

   Enforcement of legal obligations – To enforce our terms and conditions,
   protect of our intellectual property and/or the rights of third
   parties, ShareThis processes personal data in these instances via our
   legitimate interest. This may include obtaining advice and conducting
   legal proceedings.

   Sell and Promote our Business – ShareThis may choose to conduct,
   evaluate and/or promote the sale of our business via our legitimate
   interest.

   Aggregated Data – Where we aggregate data and remove digital
   identifiers (e.g., cookie IDs), we may use this data for internal
   research, marketing, and statistical analysis purposes. Please note
   that this type of de-identified data is not restricted by the GDPR.
     *

   Data Controller

   ShareThis is generally a Controller of data with respect to the data
   processed as described above. Where the GDPR applies to Usage Data and
   Profile Information and we share this data with our Customers, our
   Customers are independent controllers in relation to their processing
   of such data and they process it in accordance with their own privacy
   policies. ShareThis is also the controller of the data it collects via
   ShareThis.com.

   Data Processors

   ShareThis also has a number of agents and service providers who operate
   as processors of data on ShareThis’ behalf. This agents and service
   providers are only able to use the data as specifically directed by
   ShareThis and only to provide the services requested by us. They are
   also contractually obligated to process the data securely and under
   confidentiality obligations.

   EU Data Subject Rights

   Where the GDPR applies, EU data subjects have the following rights,
   including: a) The right to be informed about the types of data being
   processed and the legal basis for processing; b) the right to access
   and see the data being processed; c) the right of rectification, to
   make corrections to data subject to processing; d) the right to erase
   data; e) the right to restrict processing of data; f) the right of data
   portability; g) the right to object to the processing of data and f)
   the right not to be subject to automated decision-making. Some of these
   rights apply only in certain circumstances and depend on the legal
   basis relied upon to process the data. As an example, the right to
   object applies to processing which is carried out because it is
   necessary for our legitimate interests and only if we cannot
   demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds which outweigh your rights,
   interests and freedoms. The same right does not apply to processing
   which is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or to
   perform a contract with you.

   Where processing is based on your consent, in accordance with the GDPR,
   you may withdraw that consent at any time, although any processing
   previously carried out will still be legal. In order to exercise your
   data subjects’ rights or if you have any questions about these rights,
   you can write to us at privacy@sharethis.com. We will endeavor to
   respond to any requests to exercise your rights within one month from
   when they are made, although this period may be extended in some cases
   in which case we will inform you before the expiration of the one month
   period.

   You also have the right to submit complaints to the supervisory
   authority in your jurisdiction. A list of supervisory authorities in
   the EEA can be found here:
   https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.

   How ShareThis interacts with our Publishers on GDPR compliance

   If you are in the European Economic Area, you may be familiar with
   websites asking you to consent to the use of cookies and similar
   technologies. Where the ShareThis Applications are used to process
   personal data from EU data subjects, our Publishers are required to
   notify you about the use of the ShareThis Applications, mention
   ShareThis as a third party who processes your personal data and ask you
   to consent to such processing as well as the placement of cookies.

   Cross-border transfers of EU personal data

   We generally process data in the United States. When we share data, we
   provide data to companies both inside and outside the EU and the US. In
   each case, we have safeguards in place which allow those transfers to
   happen in a way that ensures data is handled in accordance with the
   applicable law.

   When we transfer personal data outside the EEA, unless the recipient or
   location to which the data is transferred has been approved by the
   European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for
   personal data, we put in place measures to ensure that the transfer
   complies with the GDPR and that the personal data which is transferred
   is appropriately safeguarded.

   When we transfer data to the United States, we put in place EU standard
   contractual clauses with the recipient unless the recipient is
   self-certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. For more information
   about our responsibilities under Privacy Shield, please visit the
   “Privacy Shield” section of the ShareThis privacy policy. More
   information about international data transfers under the GDPR can be
   found at
   https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-d
   imension-data-protection_en.  If requested, we may make available a
   copy of such safeguards, as required by the GDPR.

   Data Protection Officer and Representative

   ShareThis has appointed a data protection officer to supervise our
   personal data processing-related activities, and to respond to requests
   as required.  Our DPO can be contacted as follows: Vincent Potier
   (ShareThis DPO): dpo@sharethis.com

   ShareThis’ representative in the EU is: ShareThis UK Limited of 10 John
   Street, London WC1N 2EB, UK.

   2. Other third party agents and service providers

   We share the data described in this Privacy Notice with data storage
   and processing facilities such as Amazon Web Services who are required
   under contract to only process data according to our written
   instructions and we require them to use data only for the purposes of
   providing services to us and to implement security controls and to
   maintain the confidentiality of that information.

   3. Data Retention

   We have defined retention policies for different types of personal
   data. We only retain data for as long as necessary for the purpose for
   which we process it and only as long as it remains relevant, unless we
   need to retain it because we are required to do so by law, to defend
   and exercise claims, or for regulatory reasons.

   3.1 Usage Data, Profile Information and Data Collected via
   ShareThis.com

   We retain Usage Data and Profile Information for up to 13 months from
   the date of collection for targeted advertising, and for up to 48
   months for insights and analytics. We also retain data collected via
   ShareThis.com for up to 48 months for analytics and to ensure that our
   website functions properly.

   We may aggregate and anonymise data so that it can no longer be linked
   to a device or individual, therefore it ceases to be personal data, and
   we may retain this data for longer periods.

   3.2 Account Information

   We retain Account Information for as long as you have an active account
   with us. If you have not logged into any of our services with your
   username and password for a period of 14 consecutive months, we may
   deem your account as being inactive and delete your Account
   Information. This could result in the loss of data you may have saved
   and we do not accept liability for such deletion.

   You always have the option to cancel your account with us at any time.
   Simply sign into the site and click on the My Account at the top of the
   page. Click on Edit Profile and then select Deactivate Account and
   follow the instructions. You may also request to have your Account
   Information removed by submitting a request to privacy@sharethis.com.

   4. Data Security

   The security of your information is a high priority to ShareThis. We
   have implemented industry-standard security measures.

   While no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be
   completely secure, we strive to protect your data. It may be possible
   for third parties not under the control of ShareThis to unlawfully
   intercept or access transmissions of private communications. ShareThis
   cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to
   us.

Commitments to Privacy Standards

   ShareThis promotes transparency and control for users as members of
   various self-regulatory programs. ShareThis also participates in and
   has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
   Additional Information

   ShareThis is a member of the following self-regulatory programs:

   Network Advertising Initiative (NAI):

   ShareThis adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct.  NAI offers an online web
   opt-out platform to allow consumers to express their choices and
   provides general information related to privacy and Interest Based
   Advertising.

   The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA):

   ShareThis adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory
   Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.  The DAA opt-out
   platform offers the consumer a choice page to opt out from advertising
   services, and general information related to privacy.

   EDAA:

   ShareThis adheres to the European Interactive Digital Advertising
   Alliance’s (“EDAA”) principles.  The EDAA opt-out platform offers
   consumers in the European Union a choice page to opt out from
   advertising services, and general information related to privacy.

   GDPR and EU-US Privacy Shield:

   ShareThis, Inc. is committed to protecting data and enabling individual
   privacy rights in every location we do business. Therefore, we comply
   with the GDPR and the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.

   In accordance with the GDPR, which is designed to empower and protect
   the data privacy rights of EU individuals, ShareThis makes available
   user consent tools (ShareThis is a registered CMP with the IAB
   Transparency and Consent Framework), as well as facilitating user data
   rights outlined throughout this notice.

User Choices and Opt-out Rights

   If you do not want to receive advertisements based on Usage Data and
   Profile Information collected by ShareThis on your current browser, you
   can change and manage your preferences in relation to the collection
   and processing of Usage Data and Profile Information by clicking the
   ShareThis opt-out button available on this privacy policy.

   If you do not want to receive ads based on Usage Data collected by
   ShareThis whatever device or browser used, you must opt-out from our
   services for each device and each internet web browser.

   “Click below to “Limit Ad-Tracking” function on mobile devices”:

   Instructions by Google for most Androids: Google Play Help

   Instructions by Apple for iOS version 6 and above: Apple Support Center
   Click Here To Opt Out
   Additional Information

   Furthermore:

   This process does not mean you will stop seeing advertisements, but
   that the advertisements you do see will not be influenced by the Usage
   Data collected and Profile Information used by ShareThis.

   If you have any questions about your opt-out rights, you can write to
   us at privacy@sharethis.com.

   Browser environment: (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)

   When you change your consents or opt out, an opt-out cookie will be set
   on your browser. We must maintain the opt-out cookie on your browser in
   order to recognize you as having opted out from our service. The
   ShareThis opt-out cookie is like any other cookie; therefore, if you
   clear that cookie from your browser, use a different internet browser,
   or use a new computer to access the internet you must go through the
   process again.

   You can also opt out by visiting the following links.

   Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Opt-Out Platform

   Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Opt-Out Platform

   European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) Opt-Out
   Platform

   The Ghostery browser extension is also a good tool to see a list of all
   third-party cookies on each website you visit and allows you to
   selectively opt out.

   Note:

   The opt-out tools above are currently cookie-based ie they set a cookie
   on your browser which tells us that you have opted out. This means that
   the opt-out will only function if your browser is set to accept third
   party cookies. If your browser is set to automatically reject cookies
   or if you remove all cookies from your browser, the opt-out mechanism
   will not work since we would not see an opt-out cookie on your browser.

   Also keep in mind that cookies are browser based, therefore if you
   change browsers, operating systems or computers you would need to opt
   out again.

   Mobile environment:

   While the opt-out methods described above often work for mobile web
   browsing, they are cookie-based and are therefore less reliable in
   mobile “app” environments that may not accept interest-based
   advertising cookies.

   Instead, you can typically opt out at the mobile platform level by the
   “limit ad tracking” function within the settings, as described below.
   Though we do not collect data from mobile apps for interest-based
   advertising, we or third parties we work with may use such data
   collected by others in delivering interest-based ads.

   Most Android Users:

   To use the “opt-out of interest-based advertising” option, follow the
   instructions provided by Google here: Google Play Help.

   Please note that this is a device setting and will disable
   interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for ShareThis.

   iOS users: (version 6 and above)

   To use the “Limit Ad-Tracking” option, follow the instructions provided
   by Apple here: Apple Support Center.

   Please note that this is a device setting and will disable
   interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for ShareThis.

   Do Not Track:

   You may also stop the collection of your Usage Data by using the
   do-not-track function of your browser. ShareThis receives these
   do-not-track signals from your browser and considers them to be an
   indication that you opt out. Do-not-track functionality is available on
   many browsers.

   The Privacy Shield is administered by the US Department of Commerce
   regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
   from European Union member countries. ShareThis has certified that it
   adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice,
   Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and
   Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If
   there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy notice and
   the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall
   govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our
   certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov.

   In the context of an onward transfer, ShareThis is responsible for the
   processing of personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield and
   subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its
   behalf. ShareThis shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield
   principles if its agent processes such personal data in a manner
   inconsistent with the Privacy Shield principles, unless the ShareThis
   proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the
   damage.

   In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, ShareThis
   commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collecting or
   use of your personal information. European Union individuals with
   inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy notice should first
   contact ShareThis directly at privacy@sharethis.com. We will respond to
   your complaint within 30 days of receipt.

   We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under
   the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a
   non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the
   United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
   If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if
   your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please
   visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more
   information and to file a complaint.

   For residual disputes that cannot be resolved by the methods above,
   under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be
   available before a Privacy Shield Panel. To find out more about the
   Privacy Shield’s binding arbitration scheme, please
   see: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.

   The Federal Trade Commission has investigation and enforcement
   authority over our compliance with the Privacy Shield.

   If you believe we have not respected your rights or otherwise not
   handled data correctly, then we encourage you to contact us directly
   and we will do everything possible to help.

   However, where you still have a complaint, then you have the right to
   raise the matter with the Supervisory Authority (or data protection
   agency) in your country for resolution.
