Lindau Declaration 2020

   The Lindau Declaration 2020, first suggested by Nobel Laureate
   Elizabeth Blackburn, aims to get wide-spread support for a new approach
   to global, sustainable, cooperative open science. Until its publication
   during the Lindau Meeting 2020, the declaration is open for debate,
   changes and amendments.


   Join the Discussion

   While it was formulated with basic research as its primary focus, its
   principles and goals can apply to all types of science. The declaration
   draws upon, refers to and supports various already existing
   initiatives. It is a call to widely support new ways in science. The
   declaration currently consists of 10 goals, which are supported by its
   signatories.


   There have already been two socio-political appeals in the longstanding
   history of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, each presented on Mainau
   Island, the traditional venue of the last meeting day. The Mainau
   Declaration 1955 was an appeal against the use of nuclear weapons.
   During the 65^th Lindau Meeting 2015, 36 Nobel Laureates initially
   signed the Mainau Declaration on Climate Change as an urgent warning of
   the consequences of global warming.

Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings

   Once every year, around 30-40 Nobel Laureates convene at Lindau to meet
   the next generation of leading scientists: 600 undergraduates, PhD
   students, and post-doc researchers from all over the world. The Lindau
   Nobel Laureate Meetings foster the exchange between scientists of
   different generations, cultures, and disciplines.

Outreach

   The Council and the Foundation feel committed to share the enthusiasm
   that characterises the annual encounters between Nobel Laureates and
   young scientists with the general public. It is an integral part of the
   mission to reach out beyond the meetings at Lindau and involve society
   in the dialogue on the importance of education, science and research.

Lindauer Deklaration 2020

   Die Lindauer Deklaration 2020, initiert von Nobelpreisträgerin
   Elizabeth Blackburn, setzt sich für eine globale, nachhaltige,
   kooperative und offene Wissenschaft ein. Bis zu ihrer offiziellen
   Verkündung im Rahmen der 70. Lindauer Tagung 2020 können die Ziele und
   Inhalte der Deklaration in einem offenen Diskurs festgelegt werden.


   Beteilige dich an der Diskussion

   Während die Grundlagenforschung im Vordergrund des ursprünglichen
   Deklarationsentwurfs stand, sind die nun formulierten zehn Ziele
   anwendbar auf alle Wissenschaftsdisziplinen. Die Ziele basieren auf
   verschiedenen bereits bestehenden Initiativen und zeigen neue Wege in
   der Wissenschaft auf.


   In der Geschichte der Lindauer Nobelpreisträgertagungen gab es bereits
   zwei große gesellschaftspolitische Aufrufe, die jeweils auf der Insel
   Mainau vorgestellt wurden, traditionell der Ort des Abschlusstages der
   Lindauer Tagungen. Die Mainauer Deklaration von 1955 war ein Aufruf
   gegen den Einsatz von Atomwaffen. Während der 65. Lindauer Tagung 2015
   unterzeichneten 36 Nobelpreisträger die Mainauer Deklaration zum
   Klimawandel als eindringliche Warnung vor den Folgen der globalen
   Erderwärmung.

Lindauer Nobelpreisträgertagungen

   Einmal jährlich kommen in Lindau rund 30-40 Nobelpreisträger mit
   Nachwuchswissenschaftlern zusammen: 600 Studierende, Doktoranden und
   Postdoktoranden aus aller Welt. Die Lindauer Tagungen fördern den
   Austausch zwischen Wissenschaftlern unterschiedlicher Generationen,
   Kulturen und Disziplinen.


   Mehr

Outreach

   Es ist ein zentrales Anliegen von Kuratorium und Stiftung, die
   Gesellschaft in den Dialog über die Bedeutung von Bildung, Wissenschaft
   und Forschung einzubeziehen und die Faszination der jährlichen
   Begegnungen zwischen Nobelpreisträgern und Nachwuchswissenschaftlern in
   Lindau mit einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit zu teilen.

A Beautiful Quest: The Search for a Unified Theory

   Posted on 25/06/201625/06/2016 by Jalees Rehman

The search for a single overarching theory of nature that describes all the
fundamental physical forces and particles has been the major thrust of modern
physics. Are we about to reach this elusive goal, or is it turning into a
quixotic quest that needs to be abandoned?

     I shall let the little I have learnt come to light in order that
     someone better than I may guess the truth, and his work may
     demonstrate my error. At this I shall rejoice, and also because I
     was nevertheless a cause whereby such a truth came to light.

   Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) – Schriftlicher Nachlaß


   How will the 20th century be remembered by the historians in the year
   2525 – if man is still alive? Will the annals of history label it as
   the century of human suffering, in light of the millions of lives that
   were prematurely claimed by two world wars, countless cases of
   large-scale atrocities, ethnic cleansing and genocide? Or perhaps as
   the century in which hygiene, vaccinations and antibiotics helped save
   millions of lives, subjugated colonies gained independence from their
   oppressors and in which the majority of countries finally recognized
   women as full citizens, granting them the right to vote and
   reproductive control over their own bodies?

   Considering that the 20th century ended less than two decades ago, any
   attempt to ascertain what will be deemed significant in the coming
   centuries would be pure speculation. Nevertheless, when we reflect on
   what we believe most important about centuries past, it becomes rather
   obvious what aspects of history leave a long-lasting imprint on the
   collective consciousness of subsequent generations: expressions of
   human ingenuity. In school, we may have memorized the dates of when
   wars started and ended, but we are enthralled by the beauty and
   insights emanating from the great works of art, music, literature,
   philosophy and science of centuries past. Testaments to human
   ingenuity, tenacity and the pursuit of beauty and justice include the
   development of vaccines and antibiotics, abandoning colonialism and
   granting equality to women. But there is another, far less known
   front-runner for the most important intellectual accomplishment in the
   20th century: The Standard Model. It is also a shoo-in for the “Most
   Understated-Name-Ever Award.” What is the Standard Model, and why is it
   a pinnacle of human achievement?

   The Standard Model is to date the most comprehensive and experimentally
   validated theory of the fundamental physical forces and elementary
   particles in nature. It unifies three core physical forces, the
   electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force, and
   describes fermions – elementary “substance” particles, such as quarks,
   electrons and neutrinos – as well as bosons – elementary “force”
   particles, such as photons, gluons and the Higgs boson. As such, the
   Standard Model allows us to understand the very nature of energy and
   matter and provides a framework for understanding the universe. The
   Standard Model was finalized in the 1970s, but it is built on some of
   the conceptual revolutions in physics at the beginning of the 20th
   century, such as quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity
   which challenged traditional views of determinism, time and space.

   While there have been many important scientific developments in the
   past century, the Standard Model stands out as a prime example of how
   theoretical science and experimental science work like intercalating
   cogwheels, propelling each other forward. The theoretical framework was
   formulated in the 1970s based on prior experimental data, but it made
   definitive predictions regarding the existence of particles that had
   never been observed. And each subsequent decade, experiments undertaken
   to test its validity confirmed its predictions, such as the discovery
   of the top quark in 1995, the tau neutrino in 2000 and the Higgs boson
   in 2012/2013. This unprecedented pace of experimental testing and
   theoretical formulation of the Standard Model could only be achieved by
   the collaborative efforts of thousands of physicists, transcending
   boundaries of nationality, gender and ideology and united by their
   common goal of uncovering the fundamental laws of nature.

   The Standard Model is part of a grander quest in physics to develop
   unified theories with the ultimate goal to have one final Unified
   Theory, which is sometimes referred to as the “Theory of Everything” –
   quite a baptismal contrast to the humility exuded by the name “Standard
   Model.”

   George Smoot is Professor of Physics at the University of California,
   Berkeley, the Founding Director of the Berkeley Center for Cosmological
   Physics and received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2006 for his work
   on cosmic microwave background radiation. Smoot suggests that the
   unification of forces and concepts has been the major thrust of modern
   physics. This applies to the conceptual combining of mechanical
   classical physics and statistics to produce statistical mechanics,
   which formed the foundations of thermodynamics. The Standard Model also
   arose from a tradition of stepwise unifications, such as the classic
   unification of electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism by
   Maxwell in the 19^th century. That was followed by the development of a
   theory that unified weak and electromagnetic forces in the second half
   of the 20^th century and the Standard Model, which also included the
   strong force.

   “There has long been a goal to include Gravity and make a more unified
   theory, which is sometimes referred to the Theory of Everything even
   though we now know that there must be or likely are some additional
   forces such as dark energy,” says Smoot.

   Despite its successes, the Standard Model also has its limitations, and
   among its most important limitations is that it does not include
   gravity – the fourth of the fundamental physical forces – and that it
   also does not account for dark matter and dark energy, hypothesized
   forms of energy and matter that are thought to form the bulk of mass
   and energy in the universe and that explain key cosmological phenomena,
   such as the expansion of the universe.

   Gravity is currently best described by the Theory of General
   Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the first half of the 20^th
   century, which replaced Newton’s theory of gravity. Like the Standard
   Model, the Theory of General Relativity has been repeatedly tested and
   confirmed by experimental observations. It is also one of the most
   beautiful theories in physics. Steven Weinberg, who received the 1979
   Nobel Prize in Physics together with Abdus Salaam and Sheldon Lee
   Glashow for their pioneering work in the development of the Standard
   Model, has described the beauty of General Relativity in his book
   Dreams of a Final Theory. Weinberg admits that one cannot precisely
   define what constitutes “beauty” in physics, but one key characteristic
   of a beautiful scientific theory is the simplicity of the underlying
   concepts. Despite the appearance of greater mathematical complexity in
   Einstein’s theory, Weinberg considers it more beautiful than Newton’s
   theory because the Einsteinian approach rests on one elegant and simple
   principle – the equivalence of gravitation and inertia. A second
   characteristic for beautiful scientific theories is inevitability.
   Every major aspect of a beautiful theory appears so perfect that it
   cannot be tweaked or improved on. Any attempt to significantly modify
   Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity would undermine its fundamental
   concepts, just like any attempts to move around parts of Raphael’s Holy
   Family would weaken the whole painting.

   According to Weinberg, the final unified theory would not only comprise
   all fundamental physical forces but it would also embody beauty. This
   quest for unity and beauty may seem like an anachronism, perhaps even
   quixotic, considering that even after decades of tireless efforts by
   the world’s most brilliant physicists, it has not yet been possible to
   combine General Relativity and the Standard Model into a beautiful
   Unified Theory. Does this mean that it is time to abandon this quest
   and just accept the fact that there may be multiple distinct theories,
   such as General Relativity and the Standard Model that are all
   independently valid? Not according to many of the world’s leading
   physicists.

   Smoot explains, “There are deep underlying reasons and symmetries that
   make us think that the unification of the forces is not only a
   beautiful and powerful construct but also necessary to the completeness
   of Physics.”

   How does the concept of beauty in physics relate to other forms of
   beauty that we experience around us? Beauty in art, music, or
   literature often manifests itself as a desire of the audience to keep
   looking, listening, or reading. This form of beauty evokes a desire or
   longing in its audience. The philosopher Crispin Sartwell explored
   words for “beauty” used in six different languages, thus illuminating
   various aspects of beauty across cultures and languages. In his book
   Six Names of Beauty, Sartwell offers us the following words used to
   describe beauty and their approximate translations into English:

   None of these words is necessarily the exclusive word used for beauty
   in any given language but it suggests that certain languages can
   emphasize distinct facets of beauty. A multi-lingual perspective may
   also help us discover our own deeper concepts of beauty as we find
   parallel concepts in other languages that may not be readily apparent.
   A native English speaker, for example, can easily relate “beauty” to
   light, harmony, wholeness and nobility but a deeper meditation may
   reveal that humility and imperfection are also aspects of beauty.

   A concept of beauty which encompasses beauty, yapha, sundara, to kalon,
   wabi-sabi, hozho and the thousands of additional words used in other
   languages make it easier to understand that beauty in physics and
   beauty in art may be quite similar. The Unified Theory will represent a
   form of wholeness or completeness of the fundamental laws of physics,
   it will describe the harmony and balance between particles and forces,
   it will be expressed in the simplest possible terms, it is an ideal
   that scientists are striving towards and they hope that it will
   illuminate the fundamental mysteries of physics.

   Frank Wilczek is the Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received the 2004 Nobel Prize
   in Physics together with David Gross and David Politzer for their
   seminal work on the nature of the strong force. In addition to his work
   as one of the world’s leading theoretical physicists, Wilczek is
   actively engaged in communicating the core concepts of physics to a
   non-specialist audience via his website and several books. His most
   recent book, A Beautiful Question, is a profound exploration of the
   physics, aesthetics and philosophy surrounding the search for the
   Unified Theory. He also replaces the title Standard Model with the more
   appropriate term Core Theory. He avoids the hyperbolic and misleading
   expression “Theory of Everything” and instead points out that the Core
   Theory is a perpetual work in progress, continuously striving for
   greater beauty and unity. He is optimistic that in the near-future, the
   Core Theory will be able to accommodate the electromagnetic, weak,
   strong and gravitational forces as well as describe dark energy and
   dark matter.

   One of the routes that Wilczek maps out for the evolution of the Core
   Theory is supersymmetry, the idea that when “force” particles (bosons)
   move into quantum dimensions, they become “substance” particles
   (fermions) and vice versa. This expanded (“super”) symmetry between
   bosons and fermions posits the existence of novel superpartner
   particles. Quarks and leptons, for example, would have squarks and
   sleptons as their hypothetical boson superpartners. Gauginos, on the
   other hand, would be hypothetical fermion superpartners of gauge
   bosons. The elegance and beauty of this model is that it would offer
   the possibility of including gravity in a possible unified Core Theory
   that includes hypothetical gravitons and their equally hypothetical
   superpartner gravitinos. One of the challenges of uniting all four
   forces is that gravity is by far the weakest of all the physical
   forces. But supersymmetry and the presence of the hypothesized
   superpartners, suggests that there exist certain high energy levels at
   which the different forces begin to approximate each other. Wilczek
   states that this would still not represent the complete unification of
   the forces, but it could be a major first step. However, Wilczek also
   clearly explains that the experimental evidence for supersymmetry and
   the hypothesized superpartner particles is lacking. The Large Hadron
   Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva that experimentally validated the
   Higgs boson in 2012/2013 may need to significantly ramp up its energy
   to generate these particles.

   Another path toward a Unified Theory that is being actively pursued by
   theoretical physicists is string theory, also referred to as
   superstring theory and M-theory in its later iterations. A brief
   introduction to the concepts of string theory can be found in The Grand
   Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow, and a far more
   comprehensive one is in The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene.
   Through string theory, these physicists are also able to achieve some
   degree of a unification of the fundamental forces on a theoretical
   level, but they invoke the presence of nine spatial dimensions (string
   theory) or even ten spatial dimensions (M-theory) in addition to one
   time dimension. Proponents of string theory view it as a major
   conceptual revolution of our concept of time and space, likening it to
   the paradigm shifts in our concepts of space, time and causality that
   were triggered by the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics one
   century ago.

   However, there is one key difference that sets apart string theory from
   the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. Even though the
   latter changed our view of the world, they did not fundamentally alter
   how we pursue science. Successful science always combines theories with
   empirically-testable hypotheses and predictions. Quantum mechanics, the
   special theory of relativity, the general theory of relativity and the
   Standard Model have all been validated by experiments. Supersymmetry
   has not yet been experimentally validated, but it makes claims that
   could be eventually be tested and confirmed if the proposed
   superpartner particles are found at the LHC. However, it is difficult
   to even conceive of experiments that could prove the existence of nine
   or ten spatial dimensions. A string of critical books has recently been
   published that attack string theory on its lack of clearly defined
   hypotheses and predictions that would allow for its experimental
   validations. Farewell to Reality by Jim Baggott, Not Even Wrong by
   Peter Woit and The Trouble with Physics by Lee Smolin question whether
   a theory without experimental validation can even be considered
   scientific or whether it has begun taking on the feature of a religious
   dogma.

   To a certain extent, similar criticisms can also be brought forward
   against supersymmetry since there is no definitive experimental proof
   to back it up, just circumstantial evidence as described by Wilczek in
   A Beautiful Question. One response to critics of supersymmetry is that
   the proposed superpartner particles are so rare and require such high
   energy to generate that we may not yet have the necessary technology to
   even test the theory. The Higgs particle, for example, was predicted by
   the Standard Model several decades before the LHC was able to confirm
   its existence. It is therefore quite possible that the LHC will find
   evidence for supersymmetry in the next years as the energy levels are
   ramped up. But at what point does one abandon a scientific idea or
   theory as not validated by experiments, and how long does one continue
   to test it? And at what point does clinging to ideas that have not or
   cannot be experimentally validated become non-scientific? The search
   for the Unified Theory has raised profound questions not only about the
   nature of matter and energy but also the definition of science and the
   scientific methodology.

   I recently asked Frank Wilczek whether he felt that supersymmetry is
   still a prime candidate for a Unified Core Theory:

     I’m still optimistic about ‘low-energy,’ i.e. accessible,
     supersymmetry, since the circumstantial case for it is very strong.
     The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will have a good shot at it in the
     next few years. So far they haven’t seen any direct positive
     evidence, however, which has been disappointing for many people. For
     a long time, I’ve been worried that the LHC might not have quite
     enough energy for the job.

   Wilczek believes that the current energy levels at the LHC may be able
   to generate gauginos, the superpartners of gauge bosons, but that the
   generation of squarks and sleptons may require higher levels of energy.
   Wilczek agrees that the testability and experimental validation of
   supersymmetry is essential for it to become part of a Unified Core
   Theory. For Wilczek, experimental testability is an essential part of a
   theory’s beauty. A Unified Theory also needs to address other important
   issues that are not yet resolved by General Relativity and the Standard
   Model, such as the question of dark matter and dark energy.

     Unified Theories’ that do not address these questions in a
     satisfying way don’t deserve the name. String theory, in particular,
     falls short. (Frank Wilzek)

   Does one need string theory or M-theory to develop a Unified Theory?

   Wilczek is convinced we can make important progress at present without
   string theory or M-theory but cannot rule out that they may prove
   crucial in the long run. “They have a lot of potential, but they
   haven’t yet proved themselves to be essential parts of the description
   of Nature. It’s not clear, at least to me, what problems they’ll solve,
   or even what they are exactly.”

   Wilczek also points out that there are several other exciting questions
   in physics that will attract the next generation of physicists, some of
   which he recently outlined in an article “Physics in 100 years.” The
   search for a Unified Theory, the validation of supersymmetry and
   understanding dark matter or dark energy will be complemented by great
   discoveries in gravitational wave astronomy, quantum computation and
   many other areas of research.

   This also relates to an important point made by the Nobel Laureate
   Robert Laughlin in his book A Different Universe. An excessive focus on
   identifying the elementary forces and particles brings about a culture
   of extreme reductionism, assuming that the whole universe can be
   explained by knowing the building blocks. Taking apart a Lego sculpture
   and then laying out all the colored Lego bricks in front of us does not
   really tell us much about the beauty and splendor of the sculpture.
   Laughlin hopes and predicts that the Age of Reductionism will soon be
   replaced by an Age of Emergence in which the focus gradually shifts
   toward understanding how complex structures arise from the fundamental
   particles and atoms identified during the Age of Reductionism. Just
   like the simplicity of reductionism, the complexity of emergence also
   embodies beauty. Instead of heralding the end of physics (as is implied
   in expressions such as “Theory of Everything”), Unified Theories are
   just a starting point for the more complex questions in physics.

   The evolving Core Theories of physics exemplify the human intellect and
   spirit and have challenged our perceptions of reality. We often marvel
   at the splendor of palaces and monuments, but the enduring legacy of
   any civilization can be found in its ideas. While all the seven wonders
   of the ancient world have crumbled except for the pyramids of Giza,
   many of the ideas of ancient scholars have survived, and their
   magnificence continues to inspire us even after millennia. Even though
   the great discoveries in physics were often spearheaded by few
   scientists, they ultimately represent a collaborative effort of several
   thousands of scientists who worked together to experimentally validate
   theories and, to a larger extent, also a conjoined effort of all
   humankind who directly or indirectly contribute to these efforts,
   perhaps even by allowing public funding to support the heroic
   struggles.

   If we want to establish a legacy of our civilization that truly matters
   to our future descendants, it will not be achieved by erecting huge
   monuments but by expanding efforts to find simple and complex beauty in
   our universe. The past century of basic research in physics has been
   among the most fruitful periods in the history of any science, but it
   has also reminded us that we need to invest resources and provide
   continuing support for it to thrive. The universality of natural laws
   and the spirit of scientific collaboration across cultural and
   political boundaries may ultimately serve as a model for a more
   peaceful human co-existence. In a world that is too often polarized by
   political and religious ideologies, the search for a unified theory of
   the fundamental physical forces encapsulates the greater human quest
   for beauty. We may not always agree on what constitutes beauty but
   humans in all cultures are united in their longing for beauty. The
   arduous pursuit of beauty itself embodies beauty and is an opportunity
   for all humankind to share in the joy of this journey.
