GDPR and Privacy

   In May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces
   the existing patchwork of EU National Data Protection legislation and
   brings a level of consistency to data and privacy protection in the EU.
   Even prior to the implementation of GDPR, NETGEAR recognized the
   worldwide importance of privacy, security, and data protection to our
   customers, partners, and employees.

   We have a cross-functional approach to privacy governance, which covers
   all areas of the company and includes customer, partner, and employee
   data. The legal, customer care, IT, HR and Engineering teams meet on a
   regular basis to help guide, design, and develop products and systems
   from the ground up to protect data and privacy. NETGEAR has a Board of
   Directors’ Cybersecurity Committee that is tasked with the oversight
   and monitoring of NETGEAR’s privacy and data security and regularly
   engages with outside experts regarding various privacy issues including
   privacy by design and encryption. NETGEAR has an active cybersecurity
   program and to make sure information is secure, we strictly enforce
   privacy safeguards within the company. This means we use access
   management and access controls commensurate with the risk to data to
   ensure access to data is associated with a business need, such as
   providing customers with support.

   Specifically, as part of our EU General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) work, we have assessed, and continue to assess, our major
   processes, products, and services. In particular, we have:
     * rewritten our privacy policy which is posted on our website;
     * improved processes to help ensure data transparency, accuracy,
       accessibility, completeness, security, and consistency;
     * mapped our data and identified what we have, what we are doing with
       it, where it is, where it flows, and who has access to it;
     * assessed the privacy and data security risks and strengths in our
       enterprise systems and products;
     * implemented data incident response teams and processes;
     * implemented additional third-party controls, vendor oversight,
       monitoring, audit, and remediation requirements; and
     * embedded privacy and security requirements in the product
       development cycle.

   In addition, all NETGEAR employees are required to take training on
   Privacy and Security.

   Finally, NETGEAR complies with all applicable laws that require
   notification about data security incidents. That means we conduct
   prompt investigations and analysis, so that we can provide notification
   in a timely manner if necessary. We are also committed to providing
   customers that have been impacted by an incident with appropriate
   assistance, which may include information about support from NETGEAR or
   advice on steps customers can take to reduce the risk of harm.

GDPR and Privacy

   In May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces
   the existing patchwork of EU National Data Protection legislation and
   brings a level of consistency to data and privacy protection in the EU.
   Even prior to the implementation of GDPR, NETGEAR recognized the
   worldwide importance of privacy, security, and data protection to our
   customers, partners, and employees.

   We have a cross-functional approach to privacy governance, which covers
   all areas of the company and includes customer, partner, and employee
   data. The legal, customer care, IT, HR and Engineering teams meet on a
   regular basis to help guide, design, and develop products and systems
   from the ground up to protect data and privacy. NETGEAR has a Board of
   Directors’ Cybersecurity Committee that is tasked with the oversight
   and monitoring of NETGEAR’s privacy and data security and regularly
   engages with outside experts regarding various privacy issues including
   privacy by design and encryption. NETGEAR has an active cybersecurity
   program and to make sure information is secure, we strictly enforce
   privacy safeguards within the company. This means we use access
   management and access controls commensurate with the risk to data to
   ensure access to data is associated with a business need, such as
   providing customers with support.

   Specifically, as part of our EU General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) work, we have assessed, and continue to assess, our major
   processes, products, and services. In particular, we have:
     * rewritten our privacy policy which is posted on our website;
     * improved processes to help ensure data transparency, accuracy,
       accessibility, completeness, security, and consistency;
     * mapped our data and identified what we have, what we are doing with
       it, where it is, where it flows, and who has access to it;
     * assessed the privacy and data security risks and strengths in our
       enterprise systems and products;
     * implemented data incident response teams and processes;
     * implemented additional third-party controls, vendor oversight,
       monitoring, audit, and remediation requirements; and
     * embedded privacy and security requirements in the product
       development cycle.

   In addition, all NETGEAR employees are required to take training on
   Privacy and Security.

   Finally, NETGEAR complies with all applicable laws that require
   notification about data security incidents. That means we conduct
   prompt investigations and analysis, so that we can provide notification
   in a timely manner if necessary. We are also committed to providing
   customers that have been impacted by an incident with appropriate
   assistance, which may include information about support from NETGEAR or
   advice on steps customers can take to reduce the risk of harm.

   We use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your
   computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the
   same information repeatedly. If you choose to decline cookies, you may
   not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of NETGEAR and
   Arlo websites and services that depend on cookies.

   Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to NETGEAR
   websites. We may also use other, similar technologies from time to
   time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear
   gifs").  These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier
   that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our websites or
   opened an e-mail that we have sent them.  This allows us, for example,
   to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our
   websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
   understand whether you have come to our websites from an online
   advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
   performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.
   In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
   function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
   functioning.

We engage in interest-based advertising.

   We and our partners display interest-based advertising using
   information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or
   other platforms. This might include apps.

   Interest-based advertising or “online behavioral advertising” includes
   ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to
   return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your
   shopping habits or online activities. These ads might be served on
   websites or on apps. They might also be served in emails. We might
   serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about
   our products or other companies’ products.

How do we gather relevant information about you for interest-based
advertising?

   To decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make
   available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other
   third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools
   described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your
   purchases or browsing behaviors. We might look at these activities on
   our platforms or the platforms of others.

   We work with third parties who help gather this information. These
   third parties might link your name or email address to other
   information they collect. That might include past purchases made
   offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.

You can control tracking tools.

   Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so
   depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject
   browser cookies. To find out more about how to enable, disable, or
   delete cookies from your web browser, please visit here and here. To
   control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time
   to time, you can go here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be
   controlled through your browser settings.

   Our Do Not Track Policy: Some websites have “do not track” features
   that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are
   not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you
   block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block
   or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.

   Options you select are browser and device specific.

You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising.

   The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program
   provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online
   behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt out of
   having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes,
   click here. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
