Meet Le Bebe!

   Uncategorized

   Processed with VSCOcam with a2 preset Well friends, it‚Äôs official. I‚Äôm
   now a lady with a baby! We welcomed Carter Joseph ‚Äì all 22in, 8.2lbs of
   him last week. He arrived fashionably late ‚Äì obviously already taking
   after me ‚Äì and we could be happier/more exhausted! The old cliche is
   just so true ‚Äì your life changes in an instant. You think you know, you
   think you‚Äôve been warned ‚Äì but wow. It‚Äôs like stepping onto the dark
   side of the moon ‚Äì so much uncharted territory. And I‚Äôve only just
   begun to soak it all in. But while I‚Äôm neck deep in week-old baby
   snuggles and trying to remember my own name, you will not be left high
   and dry. You can keep tabs on Instagram and of course there is major
   power Pinning happening ‚Äì just at 3AM {how did moms survive before
   iPhones??}. Then there‚Äôs the renovation on the house picking up ‚Äì
   Tumblr is my inspiration destination for that and now that I‚Äôm finding
   new ideas at all hours of day and night ‚Äì who knows what good stuff
   might find it‚Äôs way here.

   For now, I‚Äôm going to spending a lot of time staring at tiny baby
   fingers and toes {yes there were 10 of each} so these links should keep
   you occupied for awhile!

   > We‚Äôre taking major bedside styling notes from one of our top pins of
   the week. {And if you‚Äôre curious as to where to find that lamp, we‚Äôve
   got your covered!}

   > Wondering what on earth we‚Äôre going to do with that kitchen in the
   new place? So am I! But in the meantime, we‚Äôve been gathering some
   major inspo from these gawgous kitchen trends.

   > Meanwhile, over in fashion-land, we‚Äôve been fixated by these ways to
   wear denim this season {HELLO quilted denim bomber jacket}!

   > This Parisian apartment is giving us severe cases of interior envy
   and wanderlust‚Ä¶

   > Lusting big time over Victoria‚Äôs roundup of New and Noteworthy things
   happening in the design world this spring.

   > Oohhing and ahhhing over Cuyana‚Äôs spring collection. Pastels FTW!

   > We‚Äôve become hoarders when it comes to spring fashion pins over on
   Pinterest. Especially loving any look along the lines of this.

   > This post further validated our belief that beauty does NOT have to
   be at the sacrifice of comfort.

   > It‚Äôs no secret that we love weekend getaways to Palm Springs, but
   this Local‚Äôs Guide has us jonesing to get back STAT.

   > We can‚Äôt get enough of Alison Canyne‚Äôs impeccably stylish NYC
   townhouse and her curated sale over on One Kings Lane.

   xo,

   Erin

Searching for Citrus

   Recipes

   After more sunless months than I‚Äôd care to count, my entire system is
   screaming for an influx of vitamins. Luckily for me, gorgeous citrus,
   from grapefruit, lemons, lines, and oranges of all varieties are
   starting to reappear on the shelves of my local co-op.

   citrus

   And if I‚Äôm still feeling a little deficient I might supplement with
   a fresh juice option. I‚Äôm loving the look and ingredients of Ritual
   Cleanse juices.

   Have you ever tried a juice cleanse? What did you think of it?

       I did several cleanses in the past and I¬¥m thinking it¬¥s time for
       another one! I never had the juice oly kind, but I did have a
       liquid only detox where I drank tea, water and chicken soup for 5
       days. The first two days are horrible, but than something magical
       happens‚Ä¶. yeah I definitely need to do one again! Let¬¥s be detox
       buddies! üòÄ

       I just finished my third juice cleanse last week and it was
       amazing! I used blueprintcleanse and it was super easy ‚Äì plus the
       juices are so delicious. It made me feel totally fresh and ready

       I never really considered doing a juice cleanse seriously, but
       those juices look tasty, and it seems like other readers have been
       successful, so I might give it a try to get ready for summer!

       I am starting my second cleanse on thursday (BPC), this time level
       2. The first day is not easy, but the benefits are definitely worth
       it- the glowing skin is no joke!

       I have never seen those ritual cleanse bottles! Sounds interesting
       let me know if you try it-the packaging sure is beautiful! I have
       been making sure to have a smoothie full of vitamin rich fruits and
       some kale in the mornings!

       I tried doing a liquid cleanse once (juices and soups) but it was
       pretty tough -I felt really low energy. What I've liked better is
       cleansing my body by giving it a rest from caffine, alcohol, dairy,
       meat-products, gluten, soy, sugar, etc. The site Crazysexylife.com
       has been my go-to resource.

   follow our loft life from what feels like years ago??). But this loft
   in Soho (hello, second dream realized), designed by Tina Rich, combines
   classic downtown industrials details with a light, airy, dare I say
   California vibe.
