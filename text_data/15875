   Coquelicot is a 3-year research project funded by the Fondation de
   Coopération Scientifique «Campus Paris-Saclay» and Digiteo. Its goal is
   to create a new Coq library for Reals.

We provide a user-friendly Coq library for real analysis called Coquelicot.

   An easier way of writing formulas and theorem statements is achieved by
   relying on total functions in place of dependent types for limits,
   derivatives, integrals, power series, and so on. To help with the proof
   process, the library comes with a comprehensive set of theorems that
   cover not only these notions, but also some extensions such as
   parametric integrals, two-dimensional differentiability, asymptotic
   behaviors. It also offers some automations for performing
   differentiability proofs. Moreover, Coquelicot is a conservative
   extension of Coq's standard library and we provide correspondence
   theorems between the two libraries. We have exercised the library on
   several use cases: in an exam at university entry level, for the
   definitions and properties of Bessel functions, and for the solution of
   the one-dimensional wave equation.
   This Coq library is freely available: you may click here to download
   the latest version (3.0.1, compatible with Coq 8.5 to 8.7) or browse
   the library.
