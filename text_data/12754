A WINDOW TO THE WORLD

   In today’s world, speaking one language is not enough. 220 millions
   people speak French around the world! French is an official language in
   29 countries and it is also the only language, alongside English, that
   is taught in every country in the world.

an official canadian language

   French is one of Canada's two official languages and French communities
   can be found in every province. 21% of Canadians have French as their
   mother tongue. In Calgary, close to 7% of the population can speak both
   official languages.

A career asset

    Language skills are often required for government positions,
   especially in federal departments. Studies have shown that Canadians
   fluent in both official languages have better opportunities than
   unilingual job candidates.

French is fun & familiar

   Approximately 50 percent of English vocabulary is derived from French.
   It's not quite as simple as just learning the other 50 percent, but it
   is a good start! French is an easy language to learn and our teachers
   will help you learn in a fun and efficient way!

Train your brain

   Learning a second language stimulates the brain! A 2014 study found
   that reading, verbal fluency, and intelligence were improved in people
   who learned a second language, even if they took up the language later
   in life.
