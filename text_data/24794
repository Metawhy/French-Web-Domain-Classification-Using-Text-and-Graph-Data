Rural History 2019

   It is a great pleasure to announce that Rural History 2019, the fourth
   biennial conference of the European Rural History Organisation (EURHO),
   will take in Paris from Tuesday 10 to Friday 13 September 2019. This
   meeting will be organised by the École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences
   Sociales (EHESS), through the Centre de Recherches Historiques (CRH),
   in collaboration with the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche
   Scientifique), the FMSH (Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme) and
   the EPHE (Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes).

   The Eurho Conferences are international, multidisciplinary meetings
   intended for all European and other researchers applying comparative
   approaches. They aim to promote a dialogue between rural history
   researchers which aims to surpass national frontiers, cross
   chronological barriers and break down disciplinary boundaries. They
   welcome all and any topics, that bring new insights to the historical
   study of the problems faced by rural society. These range from the
   economic and social history of the countryside (agricultural or
   preindustrial production, social reproduction, consumption, material
   culture, village life, technology, tourism and so on) to connections
   with environmental, political, anthropological and cultural history —
   and beyond these, with the preoccupations of geography, sociology,
   economy, archeology, agronomy, biology and zoology. They deal with
   subjects such as supply, power relations, gender, social well-being,
   and technological and scientific improvements in the historical
   framework of agriculture and of rural society and the relationship
   between city and countryside.

   The success of the EURHO conferences – the inaugural meeting in
   Brighton (2010) and the conferences in Bern (2013), Girona (2015) and
   Leuven (2017) – have proved EURHO ‘s usefulness as a means to
   effectively promote the history of the countryside. The Paris
   Conference will be open to all proposals employing new methods or
   yielding new results across a wide range of themes, time periods and
   spatial boundaries.  We encourage all scholars and researchers to
   submit their work and to answer the call for papers which will be
   issued this coming May.

   I will be delighted, on behalf of the EHESS, to welcome to Paris all
   participants who want to bring their knowledge and experience to this
   event. The Paris EURHO meeting is bound to be a fruitful means of
   encouraging further productive rural history research in an
   international framework. To help make this international event a
   resounding success, I ask all researchers interested in these topics to
   set aside now the four days from 10 to 13 September 2019, and to submit
   their proposals as soon as the call for panels will be launched on the
   18^th of may.

   Gérard Béaur
   Chair of the Scientific Committee

About EHESS

   vuckovic 13 avril 2018 About EHESS

   Since 1947, the EHESS (École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales,
   School of Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences) has pioneered
   innovative methods and ideas that have made landmark contributions to
   the evolution of the humanities and the social sciences. An
   interdisciplinary approach, global outlook and critical spirit are
   cornerstones of the EHESS philosophy, and have informed the thinking of
   some of the most well-known French scholars, such as Fernand Braudel,
   Pierre Bourdieu, Jacques Derrida, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Françoise
   Héritier and Thomas Piketty.

   The École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (School of Advanced
   Studies in the Social Sciences) is a graduate-only research institution
   that has a unique standing in the world of research and higher
   education in France. It hosts scholars from all over the world
   committed to the study of contemporary societies seen within broad
   cultural and historical contexts. It trains students up to PhD level in
   all disciplines of the social and human sciences (history,
   anthropology, sociology, economics, geography, linguistics, psychology,
   demography, cognitive science, political science, philosophy and
   mathematics). With its high percentage of international students and
   faculty, EHESS has created a unique global academic network. With over
   1,000 round-table seminars a year, in which faculty and guest scholars
   present and discuss their current research with students, EHESS
   occupies a central position in French intellectual life.

   EHESS is structured around research training for Master’s and PhD
   students, as well as students of its own EHESS Diploma and candidates
   for the Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches (Accreditation as a
   Research Supervisor).
   EHESS maintains close links with a number of French universities and
   research institutions operating within its disciplinary fields: the
   French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the Maison des
   sciences de l’Homme, the Écoles normales supérieures, the Muséum
   national d’histoire naturelle, the Institut national de la statistique
   et des études économiques, to name but a few.

   EHESS has 252 full time Faculty members. It has its main base in Paris
   with three regional campuses in Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse.

   The current President of EHESS is Christophe Prochasson.
