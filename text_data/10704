The Coq Proof Assistant

Welcome!

   What is Coq?

   Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language
   to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems
   together with an environment for semi-interactive development of
   machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the certification
   of properties of programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler
   certification project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming
   library), the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization
   of the Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching.

   How to get it?

   You can download the current stable version, Coq 8.9.1, released in May
   2019. It features many quality-of-life improvements, including goal
   differences as well as numeral and custom notations.

   The upcoming version, Coq 8.10 is also available for testing.

   The Coq Community

   There is a strong and active community of users working with Coq. They
   are contributing formal developments, extensions of Coq (see Coq
   Package Index), and tools based on Coq (see Related Tools). We have an
   active (multi-lingual) Discourse forum.
