Teads Advertising Service Policy

   Teads is an advertising marketplace that proposes innovative
   advertising solutions to Publishers and Advertisers all over Europe,
   USA, Latin America and Asia.

   Publishers use Teads advertising solutions to monetize their ad spaces
   either directly or through Teads advertising demand including other
   advertising buyer partners.

   Advertisers or their intermediaries (eg. media agencies) display their
   advertising campaigns through Teads advertising solutions on the
   websites or apps of our publishers partners.

   Teads advertising technology collects and uses data to help make online
   advertising more relevant as well as for ad delivery and reporting
   purposes.

Scope of this privacy policy

   Teads SA., together with its affiliates (“Teads”, “we”, “us”, or “our”)
   recognizes the importance of privacy and is committed to providing
   transparency and control over the use of the data in online
   advertising.

   This privacy policy details Teads data practices on how we collect,
   use, process and share the data we may collect through our advertising
   services as well as the ways in which individuals may exercise control
   over the use of information collected by us.
    1. User identification

   Teads does not collect or process any information that allows
   identifying a particular individual directly.

   We do not collect or process information related to (i) name, user
   address, place of work, date of birth, email address, or phone number
   (ii) hardware-based identifiers such as UDID or MAC Address and (iii)
   sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health…).

   We do not create segments to specifically target children under 16
   years old.

   In order to deliver personalized ads as well as non-personalized ads,
   Teads uses 3 methods to single out users depending on the device they
   use, web or mobile and operating system :

Cookie-based identification

   Teads drops a cookie on the user web and/or mobile browser. Cookies are
   used to single out a user and store a randomly generated identifier to
   identify his browser across visits.

Cookie-less environments

   For some environments – for example, Apple devices using Safari browser
   – Teads uses an identification methodology based on IP address
   non-reversible encryption, browser used and operating system. This
   method allows to single out a user in order to cap the number of times
   the same ad is shown to the same user.

Advertising ID

   Teads uses its SDK technology for mobile applications. For Google
   Android operating system, we use the Google Advertising ID and
   for Apple iOS the IDFA.
    2. Information we collect

   We collect data through our web tags on publisher web pages, or through
   our Software Development Kit within publisher mobile Apps.

   Collected data are :
     * Page URL
     * Browser Information (eg: Browser name and version)
     * Device Information (eg: Device type, OS)
     * Network carrier information (eg: Wifi, 4G or Wired connection)
     * Mobile application information (eg: Application name or IDFA)
     * User Interactions with Teads Ad (eg: clicks or video views)
     * IP address
     * Location Information :
          + Non-Precise Geolocation data : On Web and Web Mobile, we
            collect non precise location information such as Country and
            City that are derived from user IP Address.
          + Precise Geolocation data : On Mobile Apps, when user opt-in
            for Geo Location on the Publisher’s App, precise user
            geolocation (Latitude / Longitude) might be transferred to
            Teads SDK by the mobile App, but this data is neither stored
            nor used by Teads.

   To improve advertising relevance for users, Teads uses other data
   coming from trusted providers in order to infer general users interests
   (eg. socio-demographic, brand affinity).
    3. Data use

   We use the information we collect to deliver our services:
     * Targeting: We use data to filter the ad delivery according to user
       interests, user location (non precise geolocation is used), device
       used or page content.
     * User frequency Capping: We use data to prevent displaying too many
       times the same ad to the same user.
     * Analytics: We use collected data for monitoring and reporting the
       campaign delivery for advertisers and publishers and for internal
       business analysis.
     * Ad Delivery: We transmit collected data to programmatic buyers so
       that they can deliver their campaigns.
     * Delivery Algorithm training: We use collected data in order to
       improve our service and technology.
     * Cross device experience: To provide a consolidated experience
       through the different device or browser environments, we may link
       the Teads identifiers on the different browsers and environments
       the user is using.

    4. Data sent to Teads partners

   In order to be able to deliver an ad and measure its performance, we
   need to share data with our different partners. These companies are
   authorized to use the information we provide only as necessary to
   provide these services.
     * Programmatic Buyers : we do send data we collect as detailed in
       section 2 to Programmatic Buyers using Demand Side Platforms such
       as Google DoubleClick Bid Manager, who buy our ad placements
       through programmatic auctions ad. Those companies are responsible
       as independent controllers of the data use to deliver their ads on
       Teads network.
     * Viewability measurement. We transmit data to companies specialized
       in campaign measurement such as MOAT or IAS in order to verify that
       our ads are viewable.
     * Fraud detection. We transmit data to companies such as DoubleVerify
       in order to prevent delivering our ads on fraudulent traffic, such
       as non-human traffic.
     * Brand Safety. We transmit data to companies such as Grapeshot in
       order to prevent displaying our Ads on content that can damage an
       advertiser’s Brand.
     * Analytics and Audience measurement. We transmit data to companies
       such as Nielsen, ComScore or Mediametrie in order to measure the
       demographics of our audience.
     * Hosting. Non-aggregated data may be stored by third parties such as
       data-centers and hosting providers.

    5. Data retention and storage

   We retain the data linked to a user up to 12 months from the date of
   collection.

   We may also store aggregated and non-personal data for a longer period
   than 12 months for financial and statistical reasons.

   For security reasons, user’ IP address is stored in a private security
   log for a period of 4 months.

   Teads uses generally accepted industry security standards to protect
   data.
    6. Opt-out from Teads personalized Advertising

   If you do not want us to show you personalized ads (based on your
   inferred interests) please follow the below instructions.

To opt-out from your web browser

   If you opt-out, you will still see ads, including contextually tailored
   ads (i.e., ads tailored to the current website or app you are viewing)
   and ads based on your current location, they just may not be relevant
   to your interests.

   The opt-out mechanism will only opt you out of personalized advertising
   delivered by Teads in this browser or in mobile applications on this
   device (e.g., phones, tablets). It will not opt you out on other
   devices or in other browsers you use.

   Opt-out information is stored in a cookie during 5 years. If you delete
   your cookies, this information will be deleted and you will need to
   renew your opt-out choices.

   If you opt-out, you will still see ads, including contextually tailored
   ads (i.e., ads tailored to the current website or app you are viewing)
   and ads based on your current location, they just may not be relevant
   to your interests.

   If you want to disable Teads personalized ad, please refer to your
   operating system settings.

   Mobile device system softwares are providing mechanisms that allow
   users to opt-out of the use of information about their usage of mobile
   apps to deliver targeted ads to their mobile device. For more
   information, or to opt-out using these mechanisms, consult your device
   settings (eg. “Opt-out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android devices and
   “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS devices).

   Please note that this is a device setting which will disable
   personalized ads from all providers, and not just for Teads.

   If your device’s advertising identifier is reset, you will need to
   renew your opt-out choice for that device.
