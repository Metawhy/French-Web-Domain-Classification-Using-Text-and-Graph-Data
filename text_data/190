   Radical Love reviews

   The Ford Foundation Gallery’s second exhibition in the “Utopian
   Imagination” trilogy, titled Radical Love, features 23 artists whose
   artwork responds to the previous exhibition, Perilous Bodies, by
   offering love as the answer to a world in peril. The works are grounded
   in ideas of devotion, abundance, and beauty; here, otherness and
   marginality is celebrated, adorned, and revered.
