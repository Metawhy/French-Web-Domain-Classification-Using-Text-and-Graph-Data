   Major experience as coordinator
   Structural Supervisor/Advisor (Former Employee) –  Calgary – 9 March
   2015
   I start at 8:00 am , coordinate with technologists, make a review for
   the commitments for the week, and organize the day accordingly.
   Everyday I learn something new from my co-workers, from internet and
   seniors engineers and architects.
   My co-workers are very respectful, many more of them are professionals.
   The hardest part of the job is to train new co-workers. But I enjoy it.
   The most enjoyable part of the job is when a work has been finished
   without any problem remaining.
   Pros
   Freedom to take decisions.
   Cons
   Long oficce hours.
