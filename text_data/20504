About
       I am the founder of Tarides, where we build secure, performant and
       resource-efficient network and storage services using MirageOS.
       Previously, I was engineer at Docker where I workded on Docker for
       Mac and Windows and I co-founded Unikernel Systems, where I was
       Chief Architect, to make unikernels easier to use so that they can
       be shipped and deployed everywhere. I also was Senior Research
       Associate at the University of Cambridge. Before that, I was CTO of
       OCamlPro, Principal Virtualisation Engineer at OnApp, and Senior
       Software Engineer at Citrix. I completed my Ph.D on distributed
       systems at Inria & IRISA in the DistribCom project and I obtained
       my Master and Bachelor degrees from ENS Lyon and ENS Rennes.
       I am one of the main authors of the the MirageOS operating system
       library and the main developer of the Irmin Git-like distributed
       store. I previously designed and lead the implementation OPAM, the
       package manager for OCaml and I've worked on XenServer.

Interests
       My interests primarily involve the application of formal methods
       and functional programming languages to complex-system engineering
       problems. More generally, I have a wide range of research and
       application interests including:
          + Cloud-computing;
          + Distributed and concurrent systems;
          + Verification (model-checking) of complex systems;
          + Automatic fault-diagnosis and monitoring of complex systems;
          + Application of functional programming to real-world problems;
          + Compilation and optimization techniques;
          + Partial-order theory.
       I am doing most of my software developments in OCaml and my
       projects are hosted on GitHub.
