       customizable, cross-browser & multilingual system. Our rating
       system has the most extensive collection of rating
       templates/designs, both thumbs & stars. The implementation is easy

Customize Ratings
       Copy and paste the code below into your page immediately before the
       </body> tag.

First time here?
       Before you copy the code we have to assign your website a unique
       identifier.
       (BUTTON) Create account (BUTTON) Sign-in
<script type="text/javascript">(function(d, t, e, m){

    // Async Rating-Widget initialization.
    window.RW_Async_Init = function(){

        RW.init({
            huid: "your-unique-site-id",
            uid: "your-site-public-key",
            options: { "style": "oxygen" }
        });
        RW.render();
    };
        // Append Rating-Widget JavaScript library.
    var rw, s = d.getElementsByTagName(e)[0], id = "rw-js",
        l = d.location, ck = "Y" + t.getFullYear() +
        "M" + t.getMonth() + "D" + t.getDate(), p = l.protocol,
        f = ((l.search.indexOf("DBG=") > -1) ? "" : ".min"),
        a = ("https:" == p ? "secure." + m + "js/" : "js." + m);
    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
    rw = d.createElement(e);
    rw.id = id; rw.async = true; rw.type = "text/javascript";
    rw.src = p + "//" + a + "external" + f + ".js?ck=" + ck;
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(rw, s);
    }(document, new Date(), "script", "rating-widget.com/"));</script>

       Now, simply copy and paste the code below in the exact place you
       want the rating widget to appear.
<div class="rw-ui-container"></div>
       Done!

Need more than one rating per page?
         ______________________________________________________________

       Simply assign a unique string as the rating title for every rating
       on your site. For example you can use the following code for the
       first rating:
<div class="rw-ui-container" data-title="my awesome rating"></div>
       for the second rating use:
<div class="rw-ui-container" data-title="another great rating"></div>
       And so on.
       Note: If you assign the same ID to different items, the same rating
       would be rendered.
       If you use server-side scriptiong (e.g. PHP, Ruby, ASP.NET), and
       your rated items have a unique ID, simply use:
          +

PHP
          +

ASP.NET
          +

Ruby
          +
<div class="rw-ui-container" data-urid="<?php echo $unique_id ?>"></div>
          +
<div class="rw-ui-container" data-urid="<%= item.UniqueID %>"></div>
          +
<div class="rw-ui-container" data-urid="<%= item.uniqueID %>"></div>
