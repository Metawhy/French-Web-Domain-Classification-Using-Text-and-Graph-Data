   See Why This Colourful King Of Birds Is The Centre Of Conservation
   Efforts

   The western tragopan (or jujurana, which means “king of birds”) is one
   of the most vulnerable pheasants in the world; just 3,300 survive in
   the wild today. This species can be found only in the western Himalaya
   and is most protected in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. National
   Geographic grantee Munmun Dhalaria created a short film that features
   her sighting of the bird, one of the longest jujurana sightings ever to
   be documented in the wild. Dhalaria’s film also highlights the bird’s
   courtship display in captivity and the state’s overall conservation
   effort to protect the king of birds.

   Follow Watch Rare Footage Of The Mysterious Giant Forest Hog At last,
   the mysterious giant forest hog is being studied. Ironically, humans
   rarely see the world’s biggest pig, in part because they are often
   hunted for their meat. National Geographic Explorer Rafael
   Reyna-Hurtado has been tracking the 272-kilogram beasts for several
   years in Uganda. He strategically placed camera traps in muddy areas,
   speculating the pigs would stop to cool down. It worked. These are rare
   images of the giant forest hog, which has short black hairs, sharp
   tusks, and prominent cheeks. They play an important role in forests as
   they mow down herbaceous plants, and are prey to leopards and lions.
   However, their numbers are declining, mostly due to poaching and
   habitat fragmentation. Watch Rare Footage Of The Mysterious Giant
