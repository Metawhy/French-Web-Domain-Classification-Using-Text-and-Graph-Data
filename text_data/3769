Why Do People Abandon Financial Applications Online?

   A look at some of the issues around abandonment on financial sites, and
   how longer forms can be made easier for users.

   Abandonment can be an issue for financial services companies, as
   customers can be deterred by long application forms, but what can banks
   do to deal with this issue?

   Our most recent Remarketing Report found that finance abandonment rates
   were an average of 75.7% for Q3 2018.

   A survey by Signicat found that 56% of respondents had abandoned an
   online finance application. This is up from 40% in the same survey two
   years ago.

   It should be noted why this figure is different from the 75.7% we
   present above. Firstly, our data comes direct from client websites,
   secondly, the survey results covered both online and offline
   applications, so the two figures aren’t directly comparable.

   The reasons given are interesting though:

   One issue was the lack of an online-only option. People clearly want to
   complete applications online, saving themselves the hassle of making
   appointments and visiting bank branches.

   The factors that relate to online form abandonment most closely are
   confusing language, asking for too much personal information, and the
   length of forms.

   In this article I’ll take a closer look at form length, as this is the
   major reason for abandonment, with the help of some examples from Mapa
   Research’s report on banking form usability.
     __________________________________________________________________

Are financial forms just too long?

   A key point here is that forms shouldn’t be any longer than they need
   to be, and it’s worth reviewing forms periodically to ensure that all
   the fields included are necessary to complete the process. However,
   some forms just need to be a certain length.

   An application for a mortgage, loan or insurance is complex, and it’s
   important that companies get the information they need. Much of this is
   therefore about managing user expectations.
     __________________________________________________________________

The look and feel of the form

   Much can depend on form design and the layout of different sections.
   The choices companies take when they choose to split forms into
   different sections make a difference, as they affect how users perceive
   forms before they begin.

   If a form looks long and complex, people may decide not to spend their
   time on it.

   Here, Legal & General promises that its form will only take ‘a few
   minutes’.

   L&G 1

   However, as well as the three sections already completed, there are a
   further 12 to complete. They’re all relatively short sections with one
   or two questions in each, but it does give the impression that it’ll
   take more than a few minutes to complete.

   L&G 2

   By comparison, Confused.com asks for much of the same information in
   its life insurance form, but presents it differently.

   We have four sections rather than 15, as Confused.com has opted to ask
   for much of the information on the first page of the form.

   confused life insurance quote

   This makes for a long section, but data entry is easy with lots of
   simple yes/no buttons. Also, since users don’t need to click ‘continue’
   after every question (as they do on the Legal & General form) the
   process is faster.

   confused life insurance 2
     __________________________________________________________________

Setting expectations

   It’s important to be upfront with customers about the work involved in
   completing forms. There are two obvious way to do this.

   One way is to show a progress indicator, and the other is to provide an
   estimate for the amount of time it will take to complete the form.

   Progress indicators

   Progress indicators show how many sections there are to complete, what
   information is required in each section, and the current position of
   the user.

   As shown by the Legal & General example earlier in this article, the
   number of sections should be considered carefully. Too many could deter
   people from starting to complete forms, so the right balance needs to
   be found.

   The information should be presented clearly too. Here, HSBC’s
   presentation is confusing. It has seven main sections and several
   sub-sections, which gives the impression of a long process.

   HSBC progress tracker

   Compare this with first direct (part of the HSBC group), which reduces
   the number of steps and explains them more simply.

   first direct life insurance


   Providing an estimate of time to complete the form

   One ‘micro trend’ identified by the Mapa report was to provide an
   estimate for how long the form will take to complete.

   It’s a good way to tell customers exactly how long the form will take
   to complete. Here, Halifax includes the information, but it may go
   unnoticed within the text.

   halifax time

   Confused.com makes the estimate clearer, including the information on
   the green call to action button.

   confused contents

   It’s an interesting trend, one which helps to set expectations around
   forms. However, it’s important to be honest here. If you promise five
   minutes and it takes ten, that’s just going to annoy your users.

   Another point to consider is whether a longer time estimate deters
   users from even beginning a form. Estimates may be worth trying, but
   they should be tested and monitored.
     __________________________________________________________________

If people abandon applications…

   If users look to be about to abandon a form, there are still ways to
   persuade them to continue, or to tempt them back at a later date.

   For example Confused.com will save forms for you so you can return to
   complete them if you don’t have time to do this in one session.

   Another possible solution is to use on-site messaging to offer
   encouragement or help to complete a form. So, for example, customers
   can request a call back if they need some assistance in completing a
   form.

   On-site remarketing can also be used to offer to email users more
   information, or a link to complete forms at a later date.

   Credit-Card-OSR-By-itself
     __________________________________________________________________

In summary

   Application forms can be as much about perception as anything. Two
   forms asking for the same information can be made to seem more
   time-consuming depending on the design choices made in presenting them.

   The key is to make data entry as easy as possible, but also to be
   upfront with users about the time it will take to complete forms.

   It should also be appreciated that, however well forms are designed,
   people will abandon them from time to time for various reasons. In such
   cases it’s important to provide other options to try and save these
   customers.

   Content Marketing Specialist Nash takes us through her 7 favorite email
   remarketing headlines and what makes them so great!

   Great email remarketing means getting your customers attention… and
   fast. And while the focus is often on subject lines to get emails
   opened, we’re going to take you one step further!

   Inspired by some of our favorite brands, here’s 7 of the most effective
   headlines you can use in your cart abandonment emails to re-engage your
   customers and get them back to purchase!
     __________________________________________________________________

1 “Always finish what you start” – Reebok

   This headline from Reebok is fantastic because it taps into our
   sub-conscience and ties in seamlessly with their fitness vibe!

   Think back… from our parents to our junior high soccer coaches, we’ve
   constantly been told to ‘finish what we started’.
     __________________________________________________________________

2 “Your room feels forgotten” – Wisteria

   It’s pretty darn ingenious to add a personal touch to the message by
   using ‘your room’ instead of ‘the room.’ Not many people would overlook
   a message that personally speaks to them.

   So we’re loving how intimately appealing this is!
     __________________________________________________________________

3 “PSSST remember these” – Kipling

   We absolutely love this for it’s informal, fun tone. It’s something you
   can imagine your friend leaning over and whispering to you or maybe
   even giggling over.

   And that’s exactly what you want, a simple friendly reminder.
     __________________________________________________________________

4 “You’re one step closer to being there” – Virgin Atlantic

   This headline makes you feel like you’re only moments away from digging
   your toes under warm, sun-kissed sand and cooling off under dancing
   palm trees!

   Who wouldn’t want to be one step closer to that?!
     __________________________________________________________________

5 “Start your adventure” – Legoland

   Who doesn’t love feeling like they’re about to embark on an amazing
   adventure? And more importantly, who wants to feel like they could be
   missing out on one?

   This email headline is the perfect way to create excitement for the
   remarkable experience awaiting your customers!
     __________________________________________________________________

6 “Don’t let a good thing go” – Harvey Nichols

   This headline is classic Rom-Com meets email marketing. The guy in the
   movies, rushing to the airport to stop the love of his life from
   leaving because he knew he was about to lose a “good thing”. It
   encourages the customers to rethink what they actually could be losing,
   and that’s what we want them to do… think twice.
     __________________________________________________________________

7 “Indulge in what you love” – Donna Karan

   Three words. Love. Love. Love! This headline creates that sense of
   guilt-free, pleasurable consumption and pure luxury.

   It’s like devouring your favorite chocolate without thinking about the
   calories or splurging on that designer purse without looking at the
   price tag.

   Here’s our latest global cart abandonment data covering April, May and
   June, with an extra look at email performance stats and on-site
   conversion.

   Some highlights from Q2 2018:
   The average global cart abandonment rate for Q2 2018 was 75.4% Click To
   Tweet Cart abandonment rates are highest for travel sites (81.8%) and
   lowest for fashion retailers (71.5%) Click To Tweet
     __________________________________________________________________

On-Site Optimization Tactics

   Boosting conversion rates can be achieved through a range of tactics,
   but sometimes the right piece of information at the right time can make
   a big difference.

   On-site messaging can provide useful information for customers on stock
   availability, how close they are to completing checkout, or offer an
   opportunity for customers to ask any questions.
     __________________________________________________________________

Progress Bars

   Progress bars can be used in a number of ways. Often they are used to
   show customers how many checkout steps are left before they complete a
   purchase.

   They can also be used to convey other information, such as how much
   more customers need to spend to qualify for extra benefits such as
   discounts or free shipping.

   In the examples below, customers are encouraged to spend a little more
   to avoid shipping costs. The progress bar is a great visual cue which
   conveys useful information to shoppers.
     __________________________________________________________________

Contact Options

   During the checkout process, shoppers can still have doubts about a
   purchase, and can require some further information and reassurance
   before buying.

   By making it easy to get in touch, retailers can offer customers a
   helping hand at the point where they’re about to make a purchase.

   For example, ‘Call Me’ messages can be triggered as a shopper is about
   to make a purchase, offering to call them if they need any help.

   A little assistance in completing checkout forms, or some key
   information on shipping costs and times can be enough to prevent
   shoppers from abandoning the purchase.

Live Trends Data

   Showing live trends data to shoppers provides them with useful
   information which can help them to come to a decision, and also adds an
   element of urgency which can speed up conversions.

   For example, if there’s only one pair of shoes left in a customer’s
   size, then they need to buy quickly to avoid the risk of missing out.

   Used well, it provides the shopper with useful data which informs their
   decision, which is good for the retailer and the customer.

   UPDATE: We won! Last night our SMS Remarketing solution won the “Mobile
   Sales Promotion/Lead Generation/Direct Response/Strategy” award at the
   MOMA Awards 2016.

   Head of Product, Michael Barber, shares the story behind the Marketing
   On Mobile Awards 2016 double nomination (and subsequent win) for
   SaleCycle’s SMS Remarketing solution.

   The MOMAs celebrate and acknowledge, effective marketing on mobile and
   SaleCycle’s world’s first SMS remarketing campaign is a 2016 finalist
   alongside global brands such as Starbucks, Jaguar and Mondelez.

So just how did we end up in such illustrious company?

   Firefly, a subsidiary of Malaysian Airlines and one of SaleCycle’s most
   innovative clients, set the challenge of delivering a service that
   could drive more immediacy in conversions. How could they communicate
   quickly and efficiently with visitors who abandon a flight that was due
   to depart just days after the customer had initially visited their
   website?

   Firefly was already in the process of asking for a mobile number during
   the quoting process. It was clear that if SaleCycle could expand its
   solutions to include SMS as a method of remarketing, that this
   immediacy could be realized.

   SMS Remarketing

   A partnership between SaleCycle and Dynmark, a global leader in the SMS
   space, had already been in the pipeline so integration only took a
   matter of weeks.
   Paul Putman CEO of Dynmark commented “We were really excited when
   SaleCycle presented this challenge to us. We are always heavily focused
   on helping partners achieve their product goal but helping SaleCycle
   deliver a world first solution was a real achievement.”
   [Firefly-SMS-Remarketing.png]

   Once the technology partnership was in place, the SMS remarketing
   campaign could be implemented quickly with Firefly’s online booking
   process. Amazingly enough, Firefly saw its first recovered sale from
   only the fourth SMS message: the recipient returning to the site and
   buying the flight they’d left behind.

   After the first 6 weeks, the results show that a very successful
   remarketing channel was created.

   SaleCycle had sent approximately 8,000 remarketing SMS messages
   achieving a click-through rate of 15%. The conversion rate (from send)
   was an impressive 4.5% – much higher than the global conversion rate
   for the travel sector desktop or mobile according to Smart Insights).

   “The ability to mix SMS remarketing into our existing campaigns has
   really increased our capacity for reconnecting with potential
   customers. We have already started to see recoveries and conversions
   from the SMS tool, and are excited to work on future developments with
   SaleCycle.”

   Boon Chuan Teh, Airline Systems Manager at Firefly.
