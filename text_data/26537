the rise and fall of IEDEI and the death of modern motoring culture.

   I started IEDEI back in 2008 and launched it with the idea of it being
   an authentic, genuine, and soulful place to indulge in our hobby or
   motoring as well as everything else gentlemanly and wonderful.  IEDEI
   continued for many years and i met some wonderful people through the
   blog.  This blog was cited by much larger websites and media
   organizations and I continuously received emails from media companies
   asking me for content or about photos posted or just in general about
   the site.  I never sold out.  I never put shitty google ads on my
   pages.  I never tried to sell you anything.  I never wanted to bias
   anyone about anything all i wanted was a page to share my opinions,
   share my favourite photos, videos, ideas, designs, and possible future
   trends as well as lost historical beauties.  IEDEI was a PURE idea and
   remained pure from start to finish.  Towards the end, the blog had left
   motoring culture behind as i realised automobiles and motoring were
   wonderful for me but not something I wanted to write about anymore.

   Motoring culture on the web is completely DEAD AND DECOMPOSED.  When
   IEDEI was started there were no youtube vlogs, no silly and
   overdramatic Petrolicious videos, no 50 bazillion versions of Top Gear
   from every country that nobody watches.  There were some car forums
   where people shared common ground with other owners of the same cars
   they had.  There were a few videos around of any car you could think
   of; but not too many.  There were some mainstream blogs like Autoblog,
   Jalopnik, Bring-A-Trailer (which was already a propaganda site and has
   since become a crappy auction site just profiting off opportunistic
   selling of cars combined with market manipulation).  Back in 2008
   motoring culture still had some imagination.  Something to live for…and
   it wasn’t part of the capitalism landscape it is now.  My friend
   Bradley, who ran Automobiliac launched at terrific watch company named
   Autodromo and when he launched it there weren’t scores of watch
   companies making race-inspired watches.  In fact I remember SCOURING
   the web looking for race inspired watches that were affordable and they
   were few and far between.  I used to sit with Bradley sipping on
   coffees and drinks and daydream about selling gloves and scarves and I
   remember even contacting a bag manufacturing company trying to find out
   how much it would cost to make an IEDEI branded racing bag.  It never
   happened….but it could have.  I used to wake up in the morning, check
   my friend Drew’s Motoring Con Brio site, check Bradley’s Automobiliac
   site, the fantastic Blenheim Gang site, check a few random automotive
   blogs for the latest news, and then go on with my day and move on to
   music, and science, and news, and art, and everything else i adore.  We
   went to car shows and meets and not every photo had to be hashtagged
   and trending.  We were not really involved with social media besides
   daily blogging.

   Fast forward to 2017.  Things are not pure. If you go to youtube you
   will find seas and seas of absolutely SHITE vlogs made by piles of
   NON-car people in order to make plenty of $$$ off subscribers.  I
   sometimes wonder if their subscription numbers are even real.  These
   vlogs are so monumentally terrible that i literally cannot make it
   through 1 minute without cringing endlessly and wanting to smash my
   laptop under the wheels of an oncoming garbage truck.  Superficial,
   shallow, gutless, clueless, vile, self-absorbed, useless hosts like
   Shmee150, Salomondrin, Seen Through Glass, Supercars of London, Joe
   Achilles, and the list goes on and on and on.  I’m not going to offers
   links for these clowns as i’d rather you not even watch.  I sometimes
   click on their videos just to laugh at the state of motoring culture.
   How it died a vicious death and was given to the hands of idiots for
   control.  I recently read somewhere that these are the true influencers
   of motoring culture these days.  That’s the equivalent of saying that a
   Gonorrhea infection is the largest influencer on modern sex life.  To
   me, these idiots have no idea what motoring culture is about.  They
   don’t know motoring history, they don’t understand the context behind
   their conversations, and they are simply materialists who feel it’s
   trendy and profitable to be associated with automobiles.  They will
   fade away as fast as they arrived.  I will be glad to participate in
   their demise.  Occasionally i still click on a Harry Metcalfe or Chris
   Harris video and still find a video worth watching; but they are
   needles in a haystack of awfulness.  Where are the sites that actually
   teach you something? Or inspire you? Or have any sense of emotion or
   enthusiasm?  It doesn’t exist anymore.  Recently Clarkson et al.
   launched their absurd “Drivetribe” site which was supposed to a social
   network for motoring enthusiasts.  I joined and was repulsed by the
   mountains of regurgitated generic nonsense i found at every turn.  Has
   originality run out?  i believe so.

   iedei-2017-alpine-a110

   Surely these shitclowns are not the only reason motoring culture died.
    The manufacturers forgot how to build proper cars.  People became
   addicted to instagram and facebook and the manufacturers became
   addicted to making sure they understood that people’s priorities for
   driving were to be able to take selfies in cars and read the replies to
   their instagrammed selfies while they drive.  Hence piles of electronic
   nonsense were added into the car making it a glorified mobile phone;
   with people criticizing cars which didn’t come equipped with
   infotainment satisfaction.  Nevermind the driving experience just stuff
   a bunch of leather with some big screens and an ‘advanced’ torque
   converted 19 speed automative gearbox and be happy you can afford your
   $419 a month lease on your 2017 BMW 328 X Drive M-Sport Competition
   Pack Sport Pack pile of utter shit!   Audi are building, genuinely,
   some of the most uninspired and hideous crap imaginable.  Mercedes have
   cut sausages (literally) in different lengths and raise them, lower
   them, rebadge them, and shuffle them out of the factory.  Who is
   inspired these days?  Alfa Romeo have come back to the US with cars
   that look like a new Kia and are desperately trying to convince
   everyone that somehow they still matter. Y’know 10 years ago i would
   have eaten a bowl of my own boogers to drive a ‘new’ Alfa Romeo in the
   US; but now it seems I just don’t care.   Porsche 911 blah blah Cayman
   blah blah 4 bangers? Blah blah no thanks blah blah.  So how much is a
   proper Porsche?  Yeah that’ll be a cool $140k.  Utter nonsense.  Mini
   sells a range of a bazillion models with some of them that are 3500+
   pounds in curb weight (what!?).  Saab is now dead.  Jaguar has no
   identity, and supercars are super super lame.

   lancia-hyena-interior

   I still want a Lancia Fulvia.  I still scream out in love for an Alpine
   A110 and Alpine A310. I still feel super dirty when i look at photos of
   an Alfa Romeo GTA-m.  I just recently bought a book about the
   unmistakably wonderful Lancia Hyena.  I feel that the best motoring
   culture is gone and in our history.   No I am not interested in your
   shitty Tesla Model 3X P44d superelectric 0-60 in 3.blahblah seconds
   with your 20 inch screen and 3000 pound battery.  I don’t want to drive
   a battery.  I am 41 years old and assuming i haven’t damaged my body
   too significantly i probably have a few years left.  For that time, i
   will drive whatever i want and won’t be force fed by the media or vlogs
   or any other shitty petrolicious video what i should be lusting for.
   Elon Musk is a crusty salesman who makes a fool out of everyone with
   hyping his underwhelming company up every step of the way.  I would
   rather install bulldozers into my elbows than to drive a Tesla.  You
   will never see me in a Tesla.

   This brings me to the horror show that is “vintage motoring culture”.
   When i launched IEDEI there were very few sites celebrating the old
   school design and stories and photos with others.  I remember finding
   Petrolicious once, who used to steal my content in the early days and i
   wrote them an email telling them to fuck off and stop stealing my
   content.  Fast forward to 2017 and Petrolicious release the most
   cliched, full of nonsense ‘vintage’ car videos i’ve ever seen.  An
   abomination of what this culture became.  Did I play a part in this?
   POSSIBLY.  I will, however pretend i didn’t because i can.   I can’t
   watch 20 seconds of a Petrolicious video without wanting to puke at the
   3rd rate hollywood cinematography and generic piano music added for
   “atmosphere”.  Pukealicious more like it.

   At this point you may thinking “oh this IEDEI tosser is a real bitter
   guy”….well bitter i am not.  Opinionated I AM deal with it!  I’m not
   going to fluff up my thoughts to please others.  My readers were always
   smart people with independent thoughts. That being said I still love
   motoring and i love my cars and i have some real great friends who will
   agree with much of what i think but are too nice to be so blunt about
   it.

   Things i like about motoring culture in 2017:
     * Alpine is back! they should give me a new A110 for all the Alpine
       hype i generated.
     * Lancia is dead.  Fiat should be ashamed of themselves
     * Chris Harris is still cool.  For fuck’s sake he drives a BMW 1M.
     * My BMW 1M is the greatest car i’ve ever owned or driven.  Many
       smiles every mile
     * Underappreciated cars will always exist and i will find them.
     * Modern american muscle cars are much cooler than most european cars
       now.
     * There are still good people into motoring; but you won’t find them
       with hashtags.
     * Hatchbacks MAY be making a comeback to the US market (finally!)
     * Volvo is back making wonderful looking cars again.  “the new boxy”
       as i call it.
     * I wouldn’t mind buying a new Lincoln.  They are stunning.
     * iedei-lincoln-contintental-2017

   Will IEDEI ever come back?  yeah maybe when everybody else is gone….

   Thank you to all the kind, honest, and interesting people out there.  I
   do miss interacting with many of you.  I hope you are happy and full of
   life.  Life is more interesting than any object or ‘scene’.

   I still live in NYC and this is my 1M being used as it was intended to
   be used; as a motor car driven by a madman!

INVISIBLE WOOD has been invented.

   Well this is something unexpected. Reading about innovations like this
   sometimes reminds me that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!

   Full article at Co.Design

     “The advantage of transparent wood over something like glass is that
     it has all the strength of opaque lumber—but still lets in light.
     Berglund’s process, then, could be used to create everything from
     transparent wood structures to load-bearing windows that never crack
     or shatter. “We’re getting a lot of interest from architects, who
     want to bring more light into their buildings,” says Berglund. It’s
     also as biodegradable and environmentally friendly as regular wood.
     Berglund even imagines that his composite could be used to create
     entirely new types of sustainable solar panels, made out of wood
     instead of chemically treated glass.”

Alpine Celebration Concept on display at Le Mans 2015!

   Here it is!  After years of speculation; the production design for the
   upcoming 2016/2017 Alpine ‘resurrection’.

   I have no words to say except that i LOVE it.  Similar to how I always
   imagined the resurrected Alpine to be.

IEDEI’s new daily driver.

   yes a few months ago i picked up a bright Valencia Orange BMW 1M.  740
   cars brought to the US market. Mine is #374.

   I will be doing a full review and photo-post about the car at a later
   time.

   All i can say for right now is:  It is the most fun car I have ever
   driven….the best car i have ever driven—and i’m still shocked that i
   own it and drive the pants off of it every single day.  Worthy of all
   the hype and more!  Live the dream, my rock and roll people!

Record store day 2014.

   Well i’m lucky that i live 2 blocks away from Rough Trade NYC—-so i
   woke up, went to the gym, and then put on my clothes and walked over to
   Rough Trade!

   There were TWO records i wanted.  Both debut reissues.  The first was
   the reissue 12″ of “Supersonic” by Oasis and the second was the reissue
   12″ of “An Ideal For Living” EP by Joy Division.

   The line at Rough Trade occupied much of N. 9th street and stretched on
   and down Kent Ave.

   After seeing so many people in line, i had my doubts I was going to be
   able to find the limited edition 12″ vinyl i was after—–but 5 minutes
   after entering, i had what i needed in hand!  It only took 1.5 hours.
   Well worth it though…..and the records?  well i already knew BOTH were
   amazing….and they certainly are.  Both are remastered and sound better
   than ever.   People were so excited to find the records they were
   looking for…..as was I.

Week of March 2X, Two Thousand 14.


   Status post watching a documentary about Big Star.  They influenced
   some bands i really love like Teenage Fanclub and Whiteout.   The
   documentary was a bit of a bore after the first 30 minutes, but I think
   it was made for those religiously dovoted to them.  I like some of the
   tunes…..like “Thirteen” which i always associated to Teenage Fanclub
   while ignoring the fact that it was a Big Star tune!  Yeah nice one,
   man.

   My delightful wife bought me a Crosley record player and i’ve been
   hunting down obscure and favourite records over the past few weeks;
   culminating in a renewed interest in findings all of those weird
   Elephant records released on vinyl only in the late 90s.   This is the
   UK band Elephant, based out of Brighton.  Yes nobody knows who they are
   it seems.   One day, Ingo Graham (singer wearing lipstick in every
   promo photo i’ve seen) will come out of hiding and me a superstar
   though….and i’ll have those rare old records!

   On my birthday (March 1st) my wife took me to the Guggenheim to check
   out the magnificently huge Futurism exhibit.  It sort of bothered me to
   see ordinary people falling in love with Futurism, but at the same time
   it made me overjoyed to see SO MUCH Futurism exhibited in one location.
    A spectacular show for people such as me who have been fascinated by
   Futurism for such a long time.  You must go see it! (on until September
   2014)

   What record am i most excited about!?  Well i’ve pre-ordered the
   Killing Sound EP on Blackest Ever Black which comes in a limited
   edition Double 12″.  The record is sold out now, but definitely worth
   hearing!  Dark, dusty, frosty dub-influenced ambient drone.  Yes
   please.  It’s kind of obscure…so much that i can’t even find a
   soundclip online; but trust me i have the EP already on MP3 and it is
   stunning!

   Car culture may be ridiculously shallow and mundane; but that doesn’t
   stop ME from enjoying my 120 miles of driving i do every day in my,
   well…badass 2013 BMW 135is.  320hp and mighty, mighty quick.  Been
   doing donuts all winter with my snow tires on! come on!  I won’t talk
   about ‘other’ cars much here anymore, but i will definitely talk about
   what i drive…..because it’s what i live with.

   jagwar-ma-the-throw

   Anyone who knows my musical history knows my own music as well as what
   influenced was DEEPLY entrenched in Madchester and the baggy sounds of
   the early 90s.  Jagwar Ma have recently brought back some of that
   bagginess with their debut album “Howlin”.  Well worth a listen and a
   purchase, in my opinion.

   Jagwar Ma play Glasslands in Brooklyn on October 2nd.  I will be there.
    Come say hello.

i8.

   2015-bmw-i8_100439331_l

   There are very few automobiles which capture my attention, new or old,
   these days.  My interest in automobiles has faded aside from a few
   select cars which i’m always chasing.  i am, however, BLOWN AWAY by
   this car.  the fact that it is a production car that looks like a
   concept.  The fact that is totally a current car embedded with current
   technologies capturing the spirit of ‘new’ and ‘fresh’ without copying
   anything else before it.  The fact that it’s the first hybrid sports
   car that is somewhat attainable  (still expensive though…at $135k USA
   price).  But most of all I love this car because it pushes and opens an
   envelope into the current times.  No retro here.  No celebration of the
   past.  The BMW i8 is a celebration of the future.

   If i had the money…i’d order this and drive it every day!!

   Forget 0-60 times (4.4 seconds here), forget curb weight (3200+ pounds
   here), forget cost for a second, forget the badge, forget the insane
   aero design features— this car is a pioneer and a real innovation in
   this realm.  It’s rare in these generic modern times of automotive
   engineering that we see a true beginning, but i have a feeling the i8
   is the first of many coming in this realm.

   (I don’t count cars like the Porsche 918, because of price and
   uber-exclusivity)

can you guess the new IEDEI-mobile?

   A couple of months ago, i placed an order for a new car to replace the
   A3 quattro (will be keeping the TT).  I put 47k miles on the A3 in just
   over 2 years, and really needed something ‘more fun’ to entertain me
   during my 120 mile/day commute between Brooklyn and my job located out
   of the city. For the record, the A3 is 10000% reliable and never gave
   me a single issue.  A wonderful car (which is still for sale through
   this week, btw) which was actually the ideal commuter car.  I’m pretty
   sure my new car will not be as ideal as a commuter—–but will definitely
   be a whole lot more fun and exciting!

   According to my estimations, the car SHOULD arrive in the next 10 days
   as it is currently on a boat.  The choice will surprise most people,
   but it didn’t surprise me much.  I have wanted this car since i first
   drove one…

   Can you guess what it is?  (for those who already know from me telling
   you, please don’t answer as it’s unfair!)

crashingWaves.

   I have never been to Iceland, but i would like to go.  It doesn’t get
   much better than cold, oceans, ice, and snow.   This series of photos
   makes me feel like i’m standing right there.  Beautiful simplicity.  No
   material object could ever match it.

streetArt.

   streetart

   I got my introduction to ‘street art’, as many people did, from Banksy
   and his extravagant street installations of art work—however it is
   important to remember that he is merely one of thousands of brilliant
   street artists across the world.  He happened to become famous, however
   street art is one of the newest and most exciting forms of art around.

   I think what makes street art most fascinating is that it doesn’t exist
   in isolation (e.g. in a picture frame hanging from the wall).  It takes
   the best aspects of installations and art, and inserts them into a live
   setting where it can interact with its own surroundings and create
   something contextual, yet still enlightening.  I am a fan of learning
   how to see things differently; street art shows an alternative version
   of reality in the mundane, the every day, and the structures we take
   for granted.

   To those into street art, some of these photos may be more ‘popular’
   works seen, but i found them to be nicely compiled at this page on
   Memolition

meditations.

   holograms-meditations

   For the past few years—my favourite bands have all come from Sweden.
   This week i’ve been listening to a lot of Holograms.  Their new record,
   “Forever”, was released this week.  Their 1st album was sort of a
   simple, straight forward affair—while the new album is darker, more
   complex, and dare i say Broder Daniel-influenced? (Broder Daniel is one
   of my favourite bands of all time).  They even titled the album
   “Forever”, just like Broder Daniel titled one of their records
   “Forever”. Hmm.

   Holograms are playing 285 Kent Ave. on December 6th in Brooklyn.  you
   will find me there, lurking in a dark corner.

TTS.

   There were prettier, faster, more glamourous, more hyped, and more
   revered small coupes from that era (mid 60s)—but i would argue none of
   them were as COOL as the NSU TTS.  rear-engined.  rear-wheel drive.
   and definitely the most aggressive looking of them all.  Eat your heart
   out, italians!

   file under: off the beaten path, away from mainstream admiration
   (thankfully).

The Monocle Guide To Better Living

   monocle-guide-to-better-living-book

   Just received this Monocle book entitled “The Monocle Guide To Better
   Living”.  If you’ve never read the magazine Monocle, then i would
   strongly advise you to pick up a copy.  For people such as me with an
   imagination that finds itself wondering about different places, ideas,
   people, and ways of living—Monocle is sort of like the ‘ultimate’
   magazine of sorts.  It focuses on culture and society—but not in a way
   you would pick up from the news or from regular every day information
   outlets.  It focuses on the small details of things that really
   captivate and interest people such as myself.

   monocle-guide-to-better-living-sample

   Monocle as a magazine is a challenging, but captivating read.  I have
   spent a few breezy minutes flipping through this book thus far and my
   only description would be to say that the book continues where the
   magazine leaves off—but with a more concrete and themed presentation.
   Beautiful old-school yellow cover and binding and lovely matte pages.
   400 pages.  Wonderful for my bookshelf.  Highly recommended.

“Exit Through The Gift Shop”

   exit-through-gift-shop

   I watched this a while ago, but was for some reason reminded of it
   today when i saw an article about Banksy.  Most people have seen
   Banksy’s work somewhere at some time either in person or online or on a
   record cover…and didn’t even know it.  Whatever you think of him, he is
   definitely iconic!  This documentary is less about Banksy, and more
   about the scene around him and prominently the french guy who tried to
   make a documentary about Banksy! ha.

   90 minutes well spent watching this though! HIGHLY recommended!

if i owned a Renault 5 Turbo…

   or an Alpine—–I would definitely want this entourage of hyperactive
   french mechanics following me around, waiting for something to happen!

   (this is sort of like a ‘foto of the day’ as IEDEI used to do…..but is
   just not arsed to do anymore! ha)

Eating twisties.

   hillclimb-iedei

   This is just some unbelievable driving.  Reflexes as smooth as velvet
   and balls of steel.

   The driver is Marcel Steiner and he is driving an Osella FA 30 Zytek V8
   3.0 (whatever that is!)

M4.

   This new BMW M4 Concept is the business.  A beautiful colour named
   ‘Aurum Dust’ (what a name!) and some of the most aggressive styling
   i’ve seen out of a german car in recent memory. Thank you BMW—–for
   keeping the insanity.   I am loving some of the details here…

‘The” icon.

   Should the word “the” have an icon?  The same way “and” has an icon
   (&)?  Fascinating proposal by Australian Paul Mathis.  What do you
   think?  Here is his proposal for the icon (i think it’s lovely):

Watch Le Mans 2013! (updated)

   R18 etron 2013

   Need a place to watch Le Mans 2013?? Every year I put up the links I am
   using to watch Le Mans.  The greatest race in the world is back……on one
   side of my mind, I have an Audi Sport flag waving and on the other side
   I have a blue Alpine flag waving for LMP2.  Either way….this is the
   motor racing event of the year and definitely worth watching.

   Here are some links to watch, listen, and follow (these will be updated
   throughout the next 24 hours).  Please feel free to make any
   suggestions to other good sources.

   EUROSPORT <——- superb link, British Eurosport in with English
   commentary

   EUROSPORT #2 (also British Eurosport, thank you Ricardo for the link!)

   ACO Le Mans

   24-LeMans.com

   Listen to fantastically detailed commenting at Radio Le Mans

   LIVE TIMING via WEC! the best way to follow what’s going on with the
   positions, as well as interviews and videos

   Audi Sport, onboard the R18s with Radio Le Mans commentary

   My suggestion? find a video feed you like—and turn on Radio Le Mans and
   mute the video.

   Go Alpine! Go Audi!
