Abstract

Background

   E-cigarettes are commonly used in attempts to stop smoking, but
   evidence is limited regarding their effectiveness as compared with that
   of nicotine products approved as smoking-cessation treatments.

Methods

   We randomly assigned adults attending U.K. National Health Service
   stop-smoking services to either nicotine-replacement products of their
   choice, including product combinations, provided for up to 3 months, or
   an e-cigarette starter pack (a second-generation refillable e-cigarette
   with one bottle of nicotine e-liquid [18 mg per milliliter]), with a
   recommendation to purchase further e-liquids of the flavor and strength
   of their choice. Treatment included weekly behavioral support for at
   least 4 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained abstinence for 1 year,
   which was validated biochemically at the final visit. Participants who
   were lost to follow-up or did not provide biochemical validation were
   considered to not be abstinent. Secondary outcomes included
   participant-reported treatment usage and respiratory symptoms.

Results

   A total of 886 participants underwent randomization. The 1-year
   abstinence rate was 18.0% in the e-cigarette group, as compared with
   9.9% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.83; 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 2.58; P<0.001). Among participants
   with 1-year abstinence, those in the e-cigarette group were more likely
   than those in the nicotine-replacement group to use their assigned
   product at 52 weeks (80% [63 of 79 participants] vs. 9% [4 of 44
   participants]). Overall, throat or mouth irritation was reported more
   frequently in the e-cigarette group (65.3%, vs. 51.2% in the
   nicotine-replacement group) and nausea more frequently in the
   nicotine-replacement group (37.9%, vs. 31.3% in the e-cigarette group).
   The e-cigarette group reported greater declines in the incidence of
   cough and phlegm production from baseline to 52 weeks than did the
   nicotine-replacement group (relative risk for cough, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6
   to 0.9; relative risk for phlegm, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9). There were
   no significant between-group differences in the incidence of wheezing
   or shortness of breath.

Conclusions

   E-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than
   nicotine-replacement therapy, when both products were accompanied by
   behavioral support. (Funded by the National Institute for Health
   Research and Cancer Research UK; Current Controlled Trials number,
   ISRCTN60477608.)

Introduction

   Switching completely from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use would be
   expected to reduce risks to health.^1-3 There are questions about risks
   and benefits of use of e-cigarettes for different purposes, but an
   important clinical issue is whether e-cigarette use in a quit attempt
   facilitates success, particularly as compared with the use of
   nicotine-replacement therapy.

   A Cochrane review showed that e-cigarettes with nicotine were more
   effective for smoking cessation than nicotine-free e-cigarettes.^4 A
   trial that compared e-cigarettes with nicotine patches for smoking
   cessation used cartridge e-cigarettes with low nicotine delivery and no
   face-to-face contact. It showed similar low efficacy for both
   treatments.^5 (For further details of previous trials, see the
   Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at
   NEJM.org.) Our trial evaluated the 1-year efficacy of refillable
   e-cigarettes as compared with nicotine replacement when provided to
   adults seeking help to quit smoking and combined with face-to-face
   behavioral support.

Methods

Design and Oversight

   We conducted a two-group, pragmatic, multicenter, individually
   randomized, controlled trial. National Health Service (NHS)
   stop-smoking services are available free across the United Kingdom.^6
   This trial was conducted in three service sites from May 2015 through
   February 2018. The Health and Lifestyle Research Unit that delivers the
   service for two London boroughs (Tower Hamlets and City of London),
   along with the Leicester and East Sussex services, recruited
   participants and delivered the interventions. Participating services
   included trial information in their advertising. Participants were also
   recruited through social media. Adult smokers were invited to
   participate if they were not pregnant or breast-feeding, had no strong
   preference to use or not to use nicotine replacement or e-cigarettes,
   and were currently not using either type of product.

   The trial was approved by the National Research Ethics Service
   (reference number, 14/LO/2235). Collective unblinded data were seen
   only for the purposes of the meetings of the data monitoring and ethics
   committee. Data analyses were conducted with blinding to treatment
   assignments. All the authors contributed to the trial design,
   participated in the interpretation of the data, vouch for their
   completeness and accuracy, and made the decision to submit the
   manuscript for publication. All the authors vouch for the fidelity of
   the trial to the protocol, available at NEJM.org.

Procedures

   Smokers were provided with trial information, prescreened for
   eligibility, and, if eligible, invited to a baseline session. There,
   eligibility was confirmed, written informed consent and baseline data
   were obtained, and participants set up their quit date (normally the
   following week).^7

   Randomization took place on the quit date to limit differential
   dropout. Randomization sequences (1:1 ratio in permuted blocks of 20,
   stratified according to trial site) were generated with the use of a
   pseudorandom number generator in Stata software and were embedded into
   an application that only revealed the next treatment assignment once a
   participant had been entered into the database.

   Product use started immediately after randomization. All the
   participants received the same multisession behavioral support as per
   U.K. stop-smoking service practice.^7,8 This support involved weekly
   one-on-one sessions with local clinicians, who also monitored expired
   carbon monoxide levels for at least 4 weeks after the quit date.

   Participants were contacted by telephone at 26 and 52 weeks.
   Interviewers asked about product use and thus were aware of the
   treatment assignments. Participants who reported abstinence or a
   reduction in smoking of at least 50% at 52 weeks were invited back to
   provide a carbon monoxide reading. Participants were compensated £20
   ($26 U.S.) for their travel and time at the 52-week validation visit.

Nicotine-Replacement Group

   Participants were informed about the range of nicotine-replacement
   products (patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray, inhalator, mouth spray,
   mouth strip, and microtabs) and selected their preferred product. Use
   of combinations was encouraged, typically the patch and a faster-acting
   oral product. Participants were also free to switch products. The way
   that nicotine replacement was provided differed slightly among trial
   sites (see the Supplementary Appendix). Supplies were provided for up
   to 3 months, as per standard practice. The cost to the NHS of a 3-month
   supply of a single nicotine-replacement product is currently
   approximately £120 ($159 U.S.).

E-Cigarette Group

   A starter pack, called One Kit (Aspire, U.K. Ecig Store), was provided
   to facilitate initial use and teach participants how to use refillable
   e-cigarette products, along with one 30-ml bottle of Tobacco Royale
   flavor e-liquid purchased from U.K. Ecig Store, containing nicotine at
   a concentration of 18 mg per milliliter. The kit had a 2.1-ohm atomizer
   and 650-mAh battery. During the trial, the company discontinued this
   kit, so One Kit 2016 (Innokin, U.K. Ecig Store), with a 1.5-ohm
   atomizer and 1000-mAh battery, was used for 42 participants.
   Participants were asked to purchase their future e-liquid online or
   from local vape shops and to buy a different e-cigarette device if the
   one supplied did not meet their needs. They were encouraged to
   experiment with e-liquids of different strengths and flavors. Those who
   were unable to obtain their own supply were provided with one further
   10-ml bottle, but this was not offered proactively. Participants
   received oral and written information on how to operate the
   e-cigarette.

   The original One Kit, including five atomizers, U.K. adapter, spare
   battery, and e-liquid, was purchased wholesale for £19.40 ($26 U.S.).
   The cost of One Kit 2016, including the same extras, was £30.25 ($40
   U.S.).

   Participants in the e-cigarette group and those in the
   nicotine-replacement group were asked to sign a commitment to not use
   the nonassigned treatment for at least 4 weeks after their quit date.
   This was to minimize contamination between the trial groups.

Measures

   At trial visits, the following data were recorded: smoking status,
   expired carbon monoxide level (at baseline, 4 weeks, and 52 weeks), use
   and ratings of trial products, ratings of withdrawal symptoms (weeks 1
   through 6), adverse reactions (presence or absence of nausea, sleep
   disturbance, and throat or mouth irritation), and respiratory symptoms
   (presence or absence of shortness of breath, wheezing, cough, and
   phlegm). The Supplementary Appendix provides further details of trial
   measures.

   The primary outcome was 1-year sustained abstinence, calculated in
   accordance with the Russell Standard^9 as a self-report of smoking no
   more than five cigarettes from 2 weeks after the target quit date,
   validated biochemically by an expired carbon monoxide level of less
   than 8 ppm at 1-year follow-up and not contradicted by any previous
   self-report or validation result. Carbon monoxide validation is the
   standard measure in trials assessing nicotine-containing products (see
   the Supplementary Appendix). Participants who died (one in each group)
   were excluded. Participants who were lost to follow-up or did not
   provide biochemical validation were classified as not being abstinent
   in the primary analysis.

   Secondary abstinence outcomes included sustained abstinence from 26 to
   52 weeks, at 4 weeks, and at 26 weeks and the percentage of
   participants without sustained abstinence from 26 to 52 weeks who
   reduced their cigarette consumption by at least 50%. We also assessed
   7-day abstinence at 4, 26, and 52 weeks. In addition, we compared the
   trial groups with respect to relapse rate and time to relapse and with
   respect to the measures listed above.

Statistical Analysis

   We calculated that a sample of 886 participants would provide the trial
   with 95% power (at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05) if the true
   percentages of 1-year abstinence were 23.8% in the e-cigarette group
   and 14.0% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.7). Since
   trial setup, the abstinence rate in stop-smoking service clinics
   declined to 10%, but the sample of 886 participants would provide 85%
   power if the percentages were 17.0% and 10.0% in the respective groups.

   The primary and secondary abstinence outcomes were analyzed by
   regression of smoking status at each time point onto trial group.
   Primary analyses were adjusted for trial center to account for the
   stratification factor. In sensitivity analyses, each model was further
   adjusted for baseline covariates selected with the use of stepwise
   regression. Binary regressions were conducted by means of the
   generalized linear model with binomial distribution and logarithmic
   link to estimate the relative risk for e-cigarettes as compared with
   nicotine-replacement therapy.

   To assess the effect of missing data on the primary outcome, we
   conducted four prespecified sensitivity analyses, which excluded
   participants who did not attend at least one behavioral-support
   session, excluded participants who used the nonassigned product for at
   least 5 consecutive days, excluded participants who did not complete
   the 52-week follow-up, and imputed missing information with the use of
   multiple imputation by chained equations.^10 Missing data were imputed
   for 136 participants in each group, and 50 data sets were imputed.

   We also estimated mean differences and 95% confidence intervals between
   trial groups in product ratings and in change scores between baseline
   and follow-up time points in withdrawal symptoms, as well as
   between-group differences in the percentage of participants who had
   adverse reactions or respiratory symptoms, using binomial regression
   with adjustment for trial center (see the statistical analysis plan,
   available with the protocol at NEJM.org). Analyses were conducted with
   the use of Stata software, version 15 (StataCorp).

   and Follow-up.

   Reasons for ineligibility in 463 of the 2045 persons screened are
   detailed in Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix. Of the 438
   participants in the e-cigarette group who were included in the primary
   analysis, 3 stopped treatment and declined follow-up and 13 stopped
   treatment and permitted follow-up. Of the 446 participants in the
   nicotine-replacement group who were included in the primary analysis, 5
   stopped treatment and declined follow-up and 36 stopped treatment and
   permitted follow-up.
   Table 1. [nejmoa1808779_t1.jpeg] Table 1. Characteristics of the
   Participants at Baseline.

   A total of 2045 clients of stop-smoking services were screened, and 886
   underwent randomization (439 to the e-cigarette group and 447 to the
   nicotine-replacement group). Of the randomly assigned participants,
   78.8% completed the 52-week follow-up (Figure 1). The sample was
   composed largely of middle-aged smokers, with 40.7% entitled to free
   prescriptions (a marker of social disadvantage or poor health) (Table
   1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Effects of Treatment on Abstinence

   Table 2. [nejmoa1808779_t2.jpeg] Table 2. Abstinence Rates at Different
   Time Points and Smoking Reduction at 52 Weeks.

   The rate of sustained 1-year abstinence was 18.0% in the e-cigarette
   group and 9.9% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.83;
   95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 2.58; P<0.001) (Table 2). The
   absolute difference in the 1-year abstinence rate between the two
   groups was 8.1 percentage points, resulting in a number needed to treat
   for one additional person to have sustained abstinence of 12 (95% CI, 8
   to 27). The result did not change substantially in the four sensitivity
   analyses (relative risk, 1.75 to 1.85; P≤0.001 for all comparisons)
   (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Abstinence rates were higher
   in the e-cigarette group than in the nicotine-replacement group at all
   time points (Table 2, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).

   We conducted a post hoc analysis, in which participants with 1-year
   abstinence who used nonassigned products (see the Supplementary
   Appendix) were removed from the sample (3% [2 of 79] in the e-cigarette
   group were using nicotine replacement and 20% [9 of 44] in the
   nicotine-replacement group were using e-cigarettes). This resulted in a
   1-year abstinence rate of 17.7% in the e-cigarette group, as compared
   with 8.0% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 2.21; 95%
   CI, 1.52 to 3.22).

   Among participants in whom full abstinence was not achieved, more had a
   carbon monoxide–validated reduction of smoking by at least 50% in the
   e-cigarette group than in the nicotine-replacement group (Table 2).
   Time to relapse and relapse rates at 52 weeks among participants with
   sustained abstinence at 4 weeks did not differ substantially between
   the two trial groups (hazard ratio for time to relapse, 1.14; 95% CI,
   0.96 to 1.34; relative risk of relapse at 52 weeks, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.93
   to 1.73).

Treatment Adherence and Ratings and Effects on Withdrawal Symptoms

   Table 3. [nejmoa1808779_t3.jpeg] Table 3. Attendance and Treatment
   Adherence.

   Overall adherence was similar in the two groups, but e-cigarettes were
   used more frequently and for longer than nicotine replacement (Table
   3). In the nicotine-replacement group, 88.1% of participants used
   nicotine-replacement combinations. In the e-cigarette group,
   practically all participants used refillable e-cigarettes (Table S4 in
   the Supplementary Appendix).

   Among participants with 1-year abstinence, 80% (63 of 79) were using
   e-cigarettes at 52 weeks in the e-cigarette group and 9% (4 of 44) were
   using nicotine replacement in the nicotine-replacement group. Further
   details of product use (including the use of nonassigned products) are
   provided in the Supplementary Appendix, including Tables S4 and S5.

   Both e-cigarettes and nicotine-replacement products were perceived to
   be less satisfying than cigarettes. However, e-cigarettes provided
   greater satisfaction and were rated as more helpful to refrain from
   smoking than nicotine-replacement products (Table S6 in the
   Supplementary Appendix).
   Table 4. [nejmoa1808779_t4.jpeg] Table 4. Urges to Smoke in
   Participants with Abstinence at 1 Week or 4 Weeks after Quit Date.

   Among participants with abstinence at 1 week after their quit date as
   well as participants with abstinence at 4 weeks, those in the
   e-cigarette group had less severe urges to smoke than did those in the
   nicotine-replacement group (Table 4). They also reported a smaller
   increase from baseline in irritability, restlessness, and inability to
   concentrate than those in the nicotine-replacement group during the
   first week of abstinence. Between-group differences in hunger and
   depression were in the same direction but less substantial. By week 4,
   participants in either group who were abstinent reported little
   withdrawal discomfort (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Safety Evaluation

   Two participants died during the trial. One died from ischemic heart
   disease in the e-cigarette group and one from traumatic spine injury in
   the nicotine-replacement group.

   There were 27 serious adverse events in the e-cigarette group and 22 in
   the nicotine-replacement group (Table S8 in the Supplementary
   Appendix). No serious adverse event in either group was classified by
   the trial clinician as being related to product use, but we noted 1
   respiratory event in the nicotine-replacement group and 5 in the
   e-cigarette group (2 in participants who were smoking and not vaping, 2
   in participants who were smoking and vaping, and 1 in a participant
   whose status with respect to smoking and vaping was not known) (see the
   Supplementary Appendix).

   Of the prespecified adverse reactions of interest, nausea was reported
   more frequently in the nicotine-replacement group (37.9%, vs. 31.3% in
   the e-cigarette group) and throat or mouth irritation more frequently
   in the e-cigarette group (65.3%, vs. 51.2% in the nicotine-replacement
   group). There was little difference between the two groups in the
   percentage of participants reporting severe nausea (6.6% in the
   e-cigarette group and 6.5% in the nicotine-replacement group) or severe
   throat or mouth irritation (5.9% and 3.9%, respectively) (Tables S9 and
   S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
   Table 5. [nejmoa1808779_t5.jpeg] Table 5. Respiratory Symptoms at
   Baseline and at 52 Weeks.

   Regarding the prespecified respiratory symptoms of interest, the
   incidence of cough and phlegm production declined in both trial groups
   from baseline to 52 weeks. However, among participants who reported
   cough or phlegm at baseline, significantly more were symptom-free at
   the 52-week follow-up in the e-cigarette group than in the
   nicotine-replacement group (Table 5). To determine whether this was due
   to the higher abstinence rate in the e-cigarette group, we ran an
   exploratory analysis that controlled for abstinence status at 52 weeks.
   This did not change the results (relative risk for cough, 0.8; 95% CI,
   0.6 to 0.9; relative risk for phlegm, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9).

Discussion

   E-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than
   nicotine-replacement therapy in this randomized trial. This is
   particularly noteworthy given that nicotine replacement was used under
   expert guidance, with access to the full range of nicotine-replacement
   products and with 88.1% of participants using combination
   treatments.^11

   Our trial showed a stronger effect of e-cigarettes than previous
   trials.^5,12,13 This could be due to the inclusion of smokers seeking
   help in quitting, the provision of face-to-face support, and the use of
   refillable e-cigarettes with free choice of e-liquids. Previous trials
   provided limited or no face-to-face support and used first-generation
   cartridge products. Refillable devices are generally more efficient at
   nicotine delivery.^14

   The trial provides some indications of why e-cigarettes had better
   results than nicotine-replacement treatments. As in previous
   studies,^5,15 e-cigarettes were more effective in alleviating tobacco
   withdrawal symptoms and received better ratings than
   nicotine-replacement therapy. They may also have allowed better
   tailoring of nicotine dose to individual needs.

   The rate of continuing e-cigarette use was fairly high. This can be
   seen as problematic if e-cigarette use for a year signals ongoing
   long-term use, which may pose as-yet-unknown health risks. On the
   positive side, ongoing e-cigarette use may ameliorate withdrawal
   symptoms, such as constipation,^16 mouth ulcers,^17 and weight gain,^18
   and continue to provide some of the positive subjective effects
   previously derived from smoking.^19 Provided that ongoing e-cigarette
   use has similar effects to long-term nicotine-replacement use, for
   heavy smokers with a high risk of relapse, long-term e-cigarette use
   may also assist with preventing relapse.^20 Among participants in our
   trial in whom full abstinence was not achieved, those in the
   e-cigarette group were more likely to reduce their smoke intake than
   those in the nicotine-replacement group, but it is unclear whether this
   affects future abstinence.

   E-cigarettes caused more throat or mouth irritation, and nicotine
   replacement caused more nausea; these effects were mostly mild. There
   were mixed signals regarding the effects of e-cigarettes on the
   respiratory system. More participants in the e-cigarette group than in
   the nicotine-replacement group reported respiratory serious adverse
   events, although the difference was not significant and some of the
   affected participants were not vaping. Meanwhile, we detected positive
   effects of e-cigarette use on some respiratory outcomes. Similar
   positive effects were reported previously. A switch to e-cigarettes was
   accompanied by a reduction in respiratory infections in an online
   survey,^21 and two case studies described nonsmokers with chronic
   throat and nose infections that resolved after they started to vape.
   Antibacterial effects of propylene glycol and glycerin were suggested
   as possible explanations.^22,23 (For more on e-cigarettes and the
   respiratory system, see the Supplementary Appendix.)

   The trial had several limitations. Product assignments could not be
   blinded. Positive expectations have limited effects on long-term
   abstinence, but if nicotine replacement was seen as an inferior option,
   participants in the nicotine-replacement group could have put less
   effort into their quit attempt than those in the e-cigarette group. We
   tried to limit expectation effects by recruiting only participants with
   no strong product preference. Abstinence rates in the
   nicotine-replacement group were also at least as high as in usual
   practice^24 (see the Supplementary Appendix). Nevertheless, lack of
   blinding could affect the results. Carbon monoxide validation detects
   smoking only over the past 24 hours, so there may have been some false
   negative results. Several participants in the nicotine-replacement
   group used e-cigarettes during the trial, but this would dilute rather
   than amplify any effects of e-cigarettes. The 1-year follow-up rate of
   79% was similar to the rates of 78%,^19 79%,^5 and 75%^20 observed in
   other studies involving the same general population and setting.
   Achieving higher follow-up rates among smokers engaged in face-to-face
   treatment is difficult, because they tend to feel embarrassed if they
   do not quit, and some avoid further contact. Multiple imputation showed
   consistent results; nevertheless, incomplete follow-up represents
   another limitation of the trial.

   The findings are likely to be valid for dependent smokers who seek help
   but may not be generalizable to smokers who are less dependent or who
   try e-cigarettes for reasons other than quitting smoking. In addition,
   they may not be generalizable to less effective first-generation
   e-cigarettes. Moreover, not all service clients want e-cigarettes. In a
   previous study, 69% accepted the offer of an e-cigarette starter
   pack.^25 (For comparison, 57% of service clients opt for nicotine
   replacement and 25% for varenicline.^26)

   Further trials are needed to determine whether our results generalize
   outside the U.K. services. In addition, e-cigarette studies are needed
   that compare different levels of support. This is important for
   focusing public health messages on either encouraging smokers to switch
   to e-cigarette use within support services or recommending use with
   less intensive or no support.

   In our trial, refillable e-cigarettes had greater efficacy than
   nicotine-replacement therapy, even though nicotine replacement was
   provided in combinations and under expert guidance.

Introduction

   Except in eastern Europe and parts of Africa, mortality among adults
   has declined in most countries for decades.^1 Lower rates of death from
   infectious diseases were the early driver of this improvement, but
   there have been subsequent declines in mortality from cardiovascular
   disease and some cancers.^2,3 There have also been important trends in
   various cancers^2 — for example, the rise and subsequent decline in
   lung-cancer incidence and mortality among men in many high-income
   countries, a decline in stomach-cancer incidence and mortality as
   economies develop, and the worldwide increase in breast-cancer
   incidence.

   The hazardous effects of behavioral and dietary risk factors on
   noncommunicable diseases, and the metabolic and physiological
   conditions that mediate their effects, have been established in
   prospective cohort studies and randomized trials. This knowledge,
   together with data from risk-factor surveillance, has helped to
   establish the mortality and disease burden attributable to risk
   factors, globally and by region and country.^4-7 There is less
   information on risk-factor trends, which makes it difficult to assess
   how they have affected population health in the past or how they may do
   so in the future.
   Figure 1. [nejmra1203528_f1.jpeg] Figure 1. Deaths and Burden of
   Disease Attributable to Selected Behavioral and Dietary Risk Factors in
   2010 and the Metabolic and Physiological Mediators of Their Hazardous
   Effects.

   High-income regions are Australasia, the Asia–Pacific region, North
   America, and western Europe. The figure shows deaths (Panel A) and
   disease burden (Panel B) attributable to the total effects of each
   individual risk factor. There is overlap among the effects of risk
   factors because of multicausality and because the effects of some risk
   factors (e.g., physical inactivity) are partly mediated through other
   risk factors (e.g., high body-mass index [BMI]). Therefore, the deaths
   and disease burden attributable to individual risk factors cannot
   simply be added together. DALYs denotes disability-adjusted life-years.
   Data are from Lim et al.^5

   In this article, we summarize the available data on trends in selected
   behavioral and dietary risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and
   examine the effects they have had, or may have in the future, on the
   health of populations around the world. Risk factors such as smoking,
   alcohol consumption, excess weight, and dietary factors are responsible
   for a large share of the global disease burden, directly or through
   conditions such as high blood pressure and elevated blood glucose and
   cholesterol levels (Figure 1).^4,5

Smoking

   The hazardous effects of smoking on mortality from cancers and
   cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been known for decades.
   Effects on other globally important diseases such as diabetes^8 and
   tuberculosis^9 have also been shown. In parallel, evidence of the
   hazards of smoking in Asian countries has established that it is a
   global problem.^10-12 Moreover, exposure of pregnant women, children,
   and nonpregnant adults to secondhand smoke at home and in public places
   is associated with adverse birth outcomes, childhood respiratory
   diseases, and many of the same diseases that are associated with active
   smoking.^13
   Figure 2. [nejmra1203528_f2.jpeg] Figure 2. Trends in Lung-Cancer
   Mortality and Prevalence of Daily Tobacco Smoking in 2008.

   Panels A and B show trends in age-standardized mortality from lung
   cancer among men and women, respectively, 30 years of age or older.
   Death rates are age-standardized to the World Health Organization (WHO)
   standard population. Data are from the WHO database of vital
   statistics, with adjustment for completeness of death registration and
   for validity and comparability of cause-of-death assignment. Panel C
   shows the age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco smoking among
   adults in 2008, according to WHO region. Data are from the WHO.^14

   In most Western high-income countries, the prevalence of smoking
   increased among men in the first half of the 20th century and peaked in
   the post–World War II decades, with 80% of men having smoked at some
   point in their adult lives. Smoking among men subsequently declined in
   English-speaking countries and in northern Europe, followed by more
   than two decades of decline in age-standardized mortality from lung
   cancer (Figure 2A) and in deaths from other diseases attributable to
   smoking.^15 The prevalence of smoking among women rose throughout the
   second half of the 20th century, first in English-speaking countries
   and northern European countries, then in Japan and countries in Latin
   America and central and southern Europe. The more recent declines in
   the United Kingdom, North America, and Australia are beginning to
   translate into a plateau or decline in lung-cancer mortality (Figure
   2B) and in smoking-attributable deaths from other diseases among
   women.^15 However, lung-cancer mortality continues to rise among
   continental European women (Figure 2B).

   The majority of the more than 1 billion smokers worldwide now live in
   low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of smoking has fallen
   below 20% in Australia and Canada but has plateaued at high levels
   among men and women in central and eastern Europe, among women in some
   western and southern European countries, and among men in East Asia
   (Figure 2C).^14 An estimated 60% of men in some countries in eastern
   Europe and East Asia smoke. The prevalence of smoking among women is
   still highest in Western societies, with a prevalence of about 40% in
   some European countries.^14 The prevalence of smoking remains
   relatively low in sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 2C), and smokers there
   tend to smoke fewer cigarettes than do their Western and Asian
   counterparts.

   In addition to shifting patterns of smoking prevalence, there have been
   changes in the type of cigarettes available, including the introduction
   of “low-tar” and “light” cigarettes. A recent review concluded that
   “five decades of evolving cigarette design had not reduced overall
   disease risk among smokers.”^16 Prevention and cessation remain the
   only effective public health measures to reduce the harmful effects of
   smoking.

   Tobacco smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke together are
   responsible for about 6.3 million annual deaths worldwide and 6.3% of
   the global burden of disease, mostly in low- and middle-income
   countries (Figure 1).^5 The death toll from smoking is especially large
   in eastern Europe, where the prevalence of smoking and the prevalence
   of other cardiovascular risk factors are concurrently high; this death
   toll is increasing in the large populations of Asia and slowly
   declining in Western countries. In addition to smoking, oral tobacco
   use and betel-nut chewing are highly prevalent in South Asia and are
   responsible for a large number of cases of oral cancer and deaths from
   this disease.^17

Alcohol Consumption

   Alcohol consumption is associated with numerous diseases and injuries.
   Moderate alcohol consumption has been inversely associated with the
   risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, although the benefits may
   be greater for persons with existing cardiovascular risk factors than
   for those without such risk factors.^18 Epidemiologic studies that have
   measured both the amount and patterns of alcohol consumption have shown
   that heavy episodic (or binge) drinking not only substantially raises
   the risk of injuries but can also increase the risk of or exacerbate
   cardiovascular disease and liver disease.^19-21
   Figure 3. [nejmra1203528_f3.jpeg] Figure 3. Trends in Recorded Per
   Capita Alcohol Consumption by Adults in Selected Countries.

   In addition to recorded consumption, there is unrecorded consumption in
   some countries. For example, in 2005, adult per capita unrecorded
   consumption was estimated to be less than 0.5 liters per year in Japan
   and France; 1 to 2 liters per year in China, the United Kingdom, and
   the United States; and close to 5 liters per year in Russia. Data are
   from the WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health
   (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.GISAH).

   Although cultural factors are important determinants of alcohol
   consumption, including harmful drinking, social change and policy
   interventions have modified alcohol-drinking behaviors in some
   countries.^22,23 For example, per capita alcohol consumption has
   decreased by about one half in traditional wine-producing and
   wine-drinking countries such as Italy and France during the past few
   decades^22,23; during the same period, it has doubled in the United
   Kingdom and Denmark, and levels of consumption in the two groups of
   countries have converged (Figure 3). Alcohol consumption has increased
   steadily in Japan, China, and many other countries in Asia, where it
   was previously low.

   Alcohol consumption is responsible for about 2.7 million annual deaths
   and 3.9% of the global burden of disease (Figure 1).^5 The major
   contributors to the alcohol-attributable disease burden are cancers,
   chronic liver disease, unintentional injuries, alcohol-related
   violence, neuropsychiatric conditions, and, in some regions (especially
   eastern Europe) that have a high prevalence of binge and harmful
   drinking, a large death toll from cardiovascular diseases.^4,5,24,25
   The role of alcohol consumption in injuries and violence among young
   adults and in nonfatal neuropsychiatric conditions makes its
   contribution to the disease burden larger than its contribution to
   mortality, relative to other risk factors for noncommunicable diseases
   (Figure 1).

   Alcohol consumption is the leading single cause of the disease burden
   in eastern Europe and is one of the top three risk factors, along with
   high blood pressure and overweight or obesity, in much of Latin
   America, where it ranks ahead of smoking.^4,5,7 The effects of alcohol
   on population health are greatest in Russia and some other former
   Soviet republics. Though recorded per capita alcohol consumption in
   Russia is the same as or only slightly higher than consumption in
   western European countries, the health effects are substantially
   larger. In traditional wine-producing countries, most alcohol is
   consumed as wine during meals, in relatively modest daily amounts, by a
   large proportion of the population. In contrast, in Russia and
   neighboring countries, men (especially those of low socioeconomic
   status) consume very large amounts of spirits, either as a regular
   daily habit or by binge drinking. A substantial proportion of consumed
   alcohol is from unrecorded and nonbeverage sources such as medicinal
   and industrial ethanol. Alcohol consumption may be responsible for one
   third to one half of deaths among young and middle-aged men in
   Russia.^24,26 In contrast to the current, enormous death toll,
   mortality declined temporarily in the 1980s, when policies introduced
   under Mikhail Gorbachev reduced alcohol consumption by about one half
   (Figure 3).^25

Excess Weight and Obesity

   Numerous observational studies in Western and Asian populations have
   associated different measures of adiposity and excess body weight with
   increased total mortality and increased risks of disease or death from
   diabetes, ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke, cancers, chronic
   kidney disease, and osteoarthritis.^27-32 The risks of diabetes and
   ischemic heart disease increase monotonically with an increase in the
   body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of
   the height in meters), starting at a BMI in the low 20s. In contrast,
   the association with hemorrhagic stroke, which is more common in Asian
   populations than in other populations, has been observed only at a BMI
   of 25 or higher.^27,31 Currently, excess weight is responsible for
   about 3.4 million annual deaths and 3.8% of the global burden of
   disease, with diseases that have low mortality and long periods of
   disability, such as diabetes and musculoskeletal diseases, accounting
   for a proportion of this burden (Figure 1).^5
   Figure 4. [nejmra1203528_f4.jpeg] Figure 4. Trends in the Number of
   Obese Persons, According to Region.

   Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher. High-income North America
   includes Canada and the United States; high-income Asia–Pacific
   includes Brunei, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. See Fig. S1 in the
   Supplementary Appendix for the rise in BMI by country. Data are from
   Stevens et al.^33

   In recent decades, men and women in all but a few countries have gained
   weight, with the age-standardized mean BMI increasing by more than 2
   units per decade in some Pacific islands (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary
   Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). In
   high-income regions, the BMI is higher in English-speaking countries
   than in continental Europe and the Asia–Pacific region, especially for
   women. The global prevalence of obesity (defined as a BMI ≥30) doubled
   between 1980 and 2008, to 9.8% among men and 13.8% among women —
   equivalent to more than half a billion obese people worldwide (205
   million men and 297 million women) (Figure 4).^33,34 An additional 950
   million adults have a BMI of 25 to less than 30. The United States has
   had the largest absolute increase in the number of obese people since
   1980, followed by China, Brazil, and Mexico.^33 Currently, the
   age-standardized mean BMI ranges from less than 22 in parts of
   sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to 30 to 35 in some Pacific islands and
   countries in the Middle East and North Africa.^34 The prevalence of
   obesity ranges from less than 2% in Bangladesh to more than 60% in some
   Pacific islands.^33

Diet and Nutrition

   Centuries after the effects of specific dietary intakes on conditions
   such as scurvy were discovered, nutritional epidemiology has
   established the associations of specific foods and nutrients or overall
   dietary patterns with cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and
   diabetes^35,36 and with intermediate outcomes such as weight gain,
   increased blood pressure, and insulin resistance and
   hyperglycemia.^37-39 The large body of observational studies is
   increasingly complemented by well-designed randomized trials that have,
   for example, shown the benefits of lower salt intake, the replacement
   of saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats, and healthy dietary
   patterns.^37,38,40,41 Low dietary intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole
   grains, or nuts and seeds or a high dietary intake of salt are
   individually responsible for 1.5% to more than 4% of the global disease
   burden (Figure 1).^5
   Figure 5. [nejmra1203528_f5.jpeg] Figure 5. Trends in Composite Dietary
   Scores in Selected Countries.

   Each dietary score is a composite indicator that captures the
   availability of 21 food types in the United Nations Food and
   Agriculture Organization food balance sheets. A high Diet 1 score
   (Panel A) indicates a high availability of sugars; meat, animal
   products, animal fats, milk, and eggs; and total calories, as well as a
   low availability of pulses (legumes) and cereals. A high Diet 2 score
   (Panel B) indicates a high availability of nuts; fruits, vegetables,
   and vegetable oils; cereals; and total calories. A high Diet 3 score
   (Panel C) indicates a high availability of fish, aquatic products, and
   oil crops (e.g., soybeans, coconuts, and olives) and a relatively low
   availability of milk and pulses. Scores were calculated with the use of
   principal-component analysis, an approach that aggregates food types on
   the basis of the degree of correlation to each other within the data
   set.^43,44 Because principal components do not have a directly
   interpretable scale, we used percentiles of values (smoothed using a
   5-year moving average) for presentation. The re-scaled values therefore
   range from 0% (lowest value observed in any country in the world
   between 1970 and 2009) to 100% (highest value observed in any country
   in the world between 1970 and 2009).

   There have so far been few population-based analyses of trends in
   specific dietary risk factors. Administrative data, such as the United
   Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food balance sheets,
   provide a broad picture of dietary patterns and trends based on the
   availability of different food types for human consumption. FAO data
   show that consumption of animal fats and high-calorie foods is
   increasing in Mediterranean countries, such as Greece, but declining
   slightly in Nordic countries and New Zealand,^42 with consumption in
   these countries converging at similar levels (Figure 5A). These changes
   may also partly explain trends in serum cholesterol levels, which have
   declined more rapidly in Nordic countries and New Zealand than in
   southern Europe, with cholesterol levels now lower in Sweden and
   Finland than in Italy.^45 Dietary change has been even more drastic in
   parts of Asia, with China rapidly adopting a Western, animal-based diet
   (Figure 5A) and having one of the largest worldwide increases in serum
   cholesterol levels.^45

   Parallel to this westernization trend, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and
   cereals have become more available in Nordic and English-speaking
   Western countries and in Asia, partly because technological and
   economic developments have increased year-around availability through
   expanded production, imports, and storage capacity (Figure 5B).
   Similarly, there has been a modest increase in the availability of fish
   and other marine products in some Western and Asian countries (Figure
   5C).

   The FAO data, which are based on agricultural production and trade
   statistics, do not capture food waste or subsistence production, nor do
   they account for food processing. For example, these data do not
   include specific information about consumption of refined flour versus
   whole grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, and partially hydrogenated
   vegetables oils (and hence trans-fat consumption), all of which are
   important dietary risk factors. The FAO databases also do not record
   consumption of salt, which is common in the diets of countries at all
   stages of economic development.^46 A high intake of salt is a risk
   factor for stomach cancer and also for elevated blood pressure, which
   in turn increases the risk of stroke, other cardiovascular diseases,
   chronic kidney disease, and kidney cancer. A decrease in dietary salt
   in Japan and Finland, countries in which salt intake was previously
   more than 20 g per day in some areas, has been associated with a
   decline in rates of stomach cancer and hemorrhagic stroke.^47,48

Physical Activity

   Studies of the beneficial health effects of physical activity date back
   to the 1950s^49 and have been replicated in large cohorts.^50 Physical
   activity at work, walking, and, in some populations, bicycling used to
   be major contributors to total energy expenditure but have declined
   dramatically in industrial and urban societies. Paralleling this shift,
   more recent epidemiologic studies in high-income countries have focused
   on leisure-time activity, with less emphasis on work and methods of
   local transportation, which are important in developing countries.^51
   Only recently has attention been given to population-based measurement
   of physical activity in countries at all stages of urbanization and
   economic development. The limited available global data nonetheless
   show low levels of activity and long periods in sedentary conditions in
   high-income and urbanized countries and higher activity levels in rural
   populations that engage in agricultural activity and walk or bicycle
   long distances for daily activities.

The Global Risk-Factor Transition

   Thus far, the epidemiologic transition has been viewed as a process
   through which the share of noncommunicable diseases as causes of death
   increases with declining mortality and rising longevity. As
   population-based data on medical causes of death and, more recently, on
   risk factors have become available, a more complete picture of the
   epidemiologic transition is emerging — one in which the interplay among
   risk factors and medical care leads to distinct disease patterns in
   different populations, with variations even among noncommunicable
   diseases.^2 Despite this diversity, an increasingly salient feature of
   risk-factor transitions is that many behavioral and dietary risks, and
   their metabolic and physiological mediators, that have been prominent
   in high-income countries are now at the same or higher levels in low-
   and middle-income countries.^44 This pattern parallels the higher
   prevalence of most risk factors and higher mortality from
   noncommunicable diseases in lower socioeconomic groups than in higher
   socioeconomic groups within high-income countries.^52

   Knowledge of risk-factor trends provides a more complete picture of the
   epidemiologic transition as well as lessons for how the risk factors
   can be reduced and managed in countries at all levels of economic
   development, with the use of various preventive strategies.^2 From a
   public health perspective, smoking is currently the most
   policy-responsive behavioral risk factor, with major successes in
   tobacco control in a number of high- and middle-income countries but
   with a shifting burden to low- and middle-income nations. Harmful
   alcohol consumption has been curbed in some Western countries but
   remains a major public health burden or is even worsening in others,
   especially in eastern Europe and Latin America.^25 Curbing its current
   harms and preventing its rise in Asia and other developing regions with
   the use of interventions known to be effective^2 should be a priority.

   Although dietary patterns are shaped by cultural, environmental,
   technological, and economic factors, they can also be modified through
   mechanisms that range from broad food and agricultural policies to
   targeted pricing and regulatory interventions related to specific
   harmful or beneficial dietary components. Such mechanisms are reviewed
   elsewhere.^2,53

   The availability of population-based and personal interventions for
   tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and elevated blood
   pressure or lipid levels has made overweight, obesity, and high blood
   glucose levels the wild cards of noncommunicable-disease risks
   globally. Some have argued that the obesity epidemic may reverse
   life-expectancy gains in high-income nations.^54 At the same time,
   blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which partially mediate the
   hazardous effects of excess weight on cardiovascular diseases, have
   declined in most high-income countries and in parts of Latin
   America.^43,45 This has probably helped dampen or delay the effects of
   weight gain on cardiovascular diseases, which have declined
   impressively in industrialized countries.^55 However, there are
   currently few effective measures against the harms of overweight and
   obesity with respect to hyperglycemia, diabetes, and cancers, making
   the concurrent epidemic of diabetes a global health challenge.^56
   Randomized trials of dietary changes (in some cases combined with
   exercise) have shown moderate weight-loss benefits for up to 2
   years,^57 but the long-term and large-scale community effectiveness of
   such interventions has not been established.^58 Similarly, studies have
   modeled or qualitatively assessed the potential benefits of
   physical-activity interventions,^59 but the empirical evidence of their
   effectiveness at the population level remains limited. As a result,
   policy options and recommendations for weight control^60 and increased
   physical activity remain broad and untested but are needed to avoid a
   slowdown or even reversal of the progress in mortality reduction.^2

   Although the behaviors of individuals are important factors in the
   patterns of risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, successful
   efforts to reduce smoking, alcohol consumption, and, more recently,
   trans-fat and salt consumption show that there is great scope for
   collective action through policy formulation and implementation.^2
   Successful policies, such as tobacco and alcohol taxes and
   restrictions, should be replicated in all populations. There is also a
   need for bold and creative policies that address harmful alcohol
   consumption, improve diet, and increase physical activity.

       Behavioral and Dietary Risk Factors in 2010 and the Metabolic and
       Physiological Mediators of Their Hazardous Effects.
       [nejmra1203528_f1.jpeg]
       Figure 1. Deaths and Burden of Disease Attributable to Selected
       Behavioral and Dietary Risk Factors in 2010 and the Metabolic and
       Physiological Mediators of Their Hazardous Effects.
       High-income regions are Australasia, the Asia–Pacific region, North
       America, and western Europe. The figure shows deaths (Panel A) and
       disease burden (Panel B) attributable to the total effects of each
       individual risk factor. There is overlap among the effects of risk
       factors because of multicausality and because the effects of some
       risk factors (e.g., physical inactivity) are partly mediated
       through other risk factors (e.g., high body-mass index [BMI]).
       Therefore, the deaths and disease burden attributable to individual
       risk factors cannot simply be added together. DALYs denotes
       disability-adjusted life-years. Data are from Lim et al.^5
    2. Figure 2. Trends in Lung-Cancer Mortality and Prevalence of Daily
       Tobacco Smoking in 2008.
       [nejmra1203528_f2.jpeg]
       Figure 2. Trends in Lung-Cancer Mortality and Prevalence of Daily
       Tobacco Smoking in 2008.
       Panels A and B show trends in age-standardized mortality from lung
       cancer among men and women, respectively, 30 years of age or older.
       Death rates are age-standardized to the World Health Organization
       (WHO) standard population. Data are from the WHO database of vital
       statistics, with adjustment for completeness of death registration
       and for validity and comparability of cause-of-death assignment.
       Panel C shows the age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco
       smoking among adults in 2008, according to WHO region. Data are
       from the WHO.^14

       Figure 3. Trends in Recorded Per Capita Alcohol Consumption by
       Adults in Selected Countries.
       In addition to recorded consumption, there is unrecorded
       consumption in some countries. For example, in 2005, adult per
       capita unrecorded consumption was estimated to be less than 0.5
       liters per year in Japan and France; 1 to 2 liters per year in
       China, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and close to 5
       liters per year in Russia. Data are from the WHO Global Information
       System on Alcohol and Health
       (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.GISAH).

       [nejmra1203528_f4.jpeg]
       Figure 4. Trends in the Number of Obese Persons, According to
       Region.
       Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher. High-income North
       America includes Canada and the United States; high-income
       Asia–Pacific includes Brunei, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.
       See Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix for the rise in BMI by
       country. Data are from Stevens et al.^33
    5. Figure 5. Trends in Composite Dietary Scores in Selected Countries.
       [nejmra1203528_f5.jpeg]
       Figure 5. Trends in Composite Dietary Scores in Selected Countries.
       Each dietary score is a composite indicator that captures the
       availability of 21 food types in the United Nations Food and
       Agriculture Organization food balance sheets. A high Diet 1 score
       (Panel A) indicates a high availability of sugars; meat, animal
       products, animal fats, milk, and eggs; and total calories, as well
       as a low availability of pulses (legumes) and cereals. A high Diet
       2 score (Panel B) indicates a high availability of nuts; fruits,
       vegetables, and vegetable oils; cereals; and total calories. A high
       Diet 3 score (Panel C) indicates a high availability of fish,
       aquatic products, and oil crops (e.g., soybeans, coconuts, and
       olives) and a relatively low availability of milk and pulses.
       Scores were calculated with the use of principal-component
       analysis, an approach that aggregates food types on the basis of
       the degree of correlation to each other within the data set.^43,44
       Because principal components do not have a directly interpretable
       scale, we used percentiles of values (smoothed using a 5-year
       moving average) for presentation. The re-scaled values therefore
       range from 0% (lowest value observed in any country in the world
       between 1970 and 2009) to 100% (highest value observed in any
       country in the world between 1970 and 2009).

Pathology of Vaping-Associated Lung Injury

To the Editor:

   Figure 1. [nejmc1913069_f1.jpeg] Figure 1. Histopathology of Acute Lung
   Injury Associated with Vaping.

   Most cases showed airway-centered acute lung injury (Panel A), often
   with severe bronchiolitis accompanied by marked mucosal edema,
   sloughing of bronchiolar epithelium, and peribronchiolar organization
   (Panel B). All cases showed accumulation of foamy or vacuolated
   macrophages in peribronchiolar airspaces with pneumocyte vacuolization
   (Panel C). Four cases showed severe injury, with diffuse alveolar
   damage and hyaline membranes (Panel D); two of these patients died.

   Despite the accumulating data on the clinical and imaging features of
   vaping-associated lung injury,^1,2 its pathology is poorly understood.
   We reviewed lung biopsies from 17 patients (13 men; median age, 35
   years [range, 19–67]), all of whom had a history of vaping (71% with
   marijuana or cannabis oils) and were clinically suspected to have
   vaping-associated lung injury. Presentation was acute or subacute in
   all cases, with bilateral pulmonary opacities; all but two patients
   presented in 2019. Eleven met the criteria for a “confirmed” diagnosis
   of vaping-related lung injury; the remaining six met the criteria for a
   “probable” designation. In all cases, histopathological findings showed
   patterns of acute lung injury, including acute fibrinous pneumonitis,
   diffuse alveolar damage, or organizing pneumonia, usually
   bronchiolocentric and accompanied by bronchiolitis (Figure 1; also see
   the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter
   at NEJM.org). No histologic findings were specific, but foamy
   macrophages and pneumocyte vacuolization were seen in all cases and may
   be useful diagnostic clues in an appropriate clinical context.
   Pigmented macrophages were sometimes present but were never a dominant
   feature. Neutrophils were often prominent, but eosinophils were rare
   and granulomas were not seen. In two cases, bronchioloalveolar lavage
   fluid was available and contained abundant foamy macrophages. Despite
   treatment with glucocorticoids and maximum supportive care, two
   patients with diffuse alveolar damage died.

   To date, few reports of vaping-associated lung injury have included
   histopathological findings. Our cases corroborate many of these
   descriptions and provide some preliminary insight into the pathogenesis
   of this injury. Much recent attention has been given to the possibility
   that vaping-associated lung injury may represent exogenous lipoid
   pneumonia.^3 However, none of our cases showed histologic evidence of
   exogenous lipoid pneumonia and no radiologic evidence thereof has been
   found^2; this calls into question the diagnostic utility of identifying
   lipid-laden macrophages or performing oil red O staining on
   bronchioloalveolar lavage fluid as a marker of vaping-associated lung
   injury, as has been proposed.^3,4 The significance of this observation
   remains unclear, particularly in patients with a known vaping history;
   until more data accumulate, our observations suggest that this finding
   should be interpreted with caution, as it may simply be a marker of
   exposure and not necessarily a marker of toxicity. Although it is
   difficult to discount the potential role of lipid, we believe that the
   histologic changes instead suggest that vaping-associated lung injury
   represents a form of airway-centered chemical pneumonitis from one or
   more inhaled toxic substances rather than exogenous lipoid pneumonia as
   such, but the agents responsible remain unknown.

A Controlled Trial of a Prostacyclin and rt-PA in the Treatment of Severe
Frostbite

   This article has no abstract; the first 100 words appear below.

   To the Editor: Many alternatives have been proposed for the treatment
   of frostbite: hemodilution, platelet-aggregation inhibitors,
   low-molecular-weight heparin, alpha-adrenergic vasodilators,
   calcium-channel inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents,
   prostacyclin analogues, fibrinolytic agents, and hyperbaric oxygen.
   None have been assessed in prospective randomized trials. Small
   retrospective studies^1^^3 suggest the efficacy of thrombolysis or
   prostacyclin analogues against spasm and thrombosis.Between 1996 and
   2008, we randomly assigned 47 patients (44 men and 3 women) with severe
   frostbite to one of three treatment regimens in an open-label study.
   Severe frostbite was defined as having at least one digit (finger or
   toe) with frostbite stage 3 . . .

            Tuberculosis transmission continues to be a major public
            health challenge. In this cluster-randomized, controlled trial
            conducted in Vietnam, active community-wide screening for

            placebo plus aspirin. At 40 months, the incidence of the
            composite efficacy outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial
            infarction, or stroke was lower with ticagrelor than with
            placebo; the frequency of major bleeding was higher with

            Surprisingly, the data showed that increased doses of an

            The authors use 40 years of data on cancer incidence and
            mortality to produce curves that show changes in cancer
            incidence (decreasing, increasing, or staying stable) and the
            effect of early detection efforts on cancer incidence and that
            help to distinguish treatment advances from overdiagnosis.

            A new Maryland law that creates a prescription-drug
            affordability board to help the state regulate drug prices may
            be a harbinger of what’s to come in drug-pricing legislation.
            The law permits cost reviews when drug prices or price
            increases exceed specified thresholds.

Abstract

Background

   E-cigarettes are commonly used in attempts to stop smoking, but
   evidence is limited regarding their effectiveness as compared with that
   of nicotine products approved as smoking-cessation treatments.

Methods

   We randomly assigned adults attending U.K. National Health Service
   stop-smoking services to either nicotine-replacement products of their
   choice, including product combinations, provided for up to 3 months, or
   an e-cigarette starter pack (a second-generation refillable e-cigarette
   with one bottle of nicotine e-liquid [18 mg per milliliter]), with a
   recommendation to purchase further e-liquids of the flavor and strength
   of their choice. Treatment included weekly behavioral support for at
   least 4 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained abstinence for 1 year,
   which was validated biochemically at the final visit. Participants who
   were lost to follow-up or did not provide biochemical validation were
   considered to not be abstinent. Secondary outcomes included
   participant-reported treatment usage and respiratory symptoms.

Results

   A total of 886 participants underwent randomization. The 1-year
   abstinence rate was 18.0% in the e-cigarette group, as compared with
   9.9% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.83; 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 2.58; P<0.001). Among participants
   with 1-year abstinence, those in the e-cigarette group were more likely
   than those in the nicotine-replacement group to use their assigned
   product at 52 weeks (80% [63 of 79 participants] vs. 9% [4 of 44
   participants]). Overall, throat or mouth irritation was reported more
   frequently in the e-cigarette group (65.3%, vs. 51.2% in the
   nicotine-replacement group) and nausea more frequently in the
   nicotine-replacement group (37.9%, vs. 31.3% in the e-cigarette group).
   The e-cigarette group reported greater declines in the incidence of
   cough and phlegm production from baseline to 52 weeks than did the
   nicotine-replacement group (relative risk for cough, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6
   to 0.9; relative risk for phlegm, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9). There were
   no significant between-group differences in the incidence of wheezing
   or shortness of breath.

Conclusions

   E-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than
   nicotine-replacement therapy, when both products were accompanied by
   behavioral support. (Funded by the National Institute for Health
   Research and Cancer Research UK; Current Controlled Trials number,
   ISRCTN60477608.)

Introduction

   Switching completely from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use would be
   expected to reduce risks to health.^1-3 There are questions about risks
   and benefits of use of e-cigarettes for different purposes, but an
   important clinical issue is whether e-cigarette use in a quit attempt
   facilitates success, particularly as compared with the use of
   nicotine-replacement therapy.

   A Cochrane review showed that e-cigarettes with nicotine were more
   effective for smoking cessation than nicotine-free e-cigarettes.^4 A
   trial that compared e-cigarettes with nicotine patches for smoking
   cessation used cartridge e-cigarettes with low nicotine delivery and no
   face-to-face contact. It showed similar low efficacy for both
   treatments.^5 (For further details of previous trials, see the
   Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at
   NEJM.org.) Our trial evaluated the 1-year efficacy of refillable
   e-cigarettes as compared with nicotine replacement when provided to
   adults seeking help to quit smoking and combined with face-to-face
   behavioral support.

Methods

Design and Oversight

   We conducted a two-group, pragmatic, multicenter, individually
   randomized, controlled trial. National Health Service (NHS)
   stop-smoking services are available free across the United Kingdom.^6
   This trial was conducted in three service sites from May 2015 through
   February 2018. The Health and Lifestyle Research Unit that delivers the
   service for two London boroughs (Tower Hamlets and City of London),
   along with the Leicester and East Sussex services, recruited
   participants and delivered the interventions. Participating services
   included trial information in their advertising. Participants were also
   recruited through social media. Adult smokers were invited to
   participate if they were not pregnant or breast-feeding, had no strong
   preference to use or not to use nicotine replacement or e-cigarettes,
   and were currently not using either type of product.

   The trial was approved by the National Research Ethics Service
   (reference number, 14/LO/2235). Collective unblinded data were seen
   only for the purposes of the meetings of the data monitoring and ethics
   committee. Data analyses were conducted with blinding to treatment
   assignments. All the authors contributed to the trial design,
   participated in the interpretation of the data, vouch for their
   completeness and accuracy, and made the decision to submit the
   manuscript for publication. All the authors vouch for the fidelity of
   the trial to the protocol, available at NEJM.org.

Procedures

   Smokers were provided with trial information, prescreened for
   eligibility, and, if eligible, invited to a baseline session. There,
   eligibility was confirmed, written informed consent and baseline data
   were obtained, and participants set up their quit date (normally the
   following week).^7

   Randomization took place on the quit date to limit differential
   dropout. Randomization sequences (1:1 ratio in permuted blocks of 20,
   stratified according to trial site) were generated with the use of a
   pseudorandom number generator in Stata software and were embedded into
   an application that only revealed the next treatment assignment once a
   participant had been entered into the database.

   Product use started immediately after randomization. All the
   participants received the same multisession behavioral support as per
   U.K. stop-smoking service practice.^7,8 This support involved weekly
   one-on-one sessions with local clinicians, who also monitored expired
   carbon monoxide levels for at least 4 weeks after the quit date.

   Participants were contacted by telephone at 26 and 52 weeks.
   Interviewers asked about product use and thus were aware of the
   treatment assignments. Participants who reported abstinence or a
   reduction in smoking of at least 50% at 52 weeks were invited back to
   provide a carbon monoxide reading. Participants were compensated £20
   ($26 U.S.) for their travel and time at the 52-week validation visit.

Nicotine-Replacement Group

   Participants were informed about the range of nicotine-replacement
   products (patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray, inhalator, mouth spray,
   mouth strip, and microtabs) and selected their preferred product. Use
   of combinations was encouraged, typically the patch and a faster-acting
   oral product. Participants were also free to switch products. The way
   that nicotine replacement was provided differed slightly among trial
   sites (see the Supplementary Appendix). Supplies were provided for up
   to 3 months, as per standard practice. The cost to the NHS of a 3-month
   supply of a single nicotine-replacement product is currently
   approximately £120 ($159 U.S.).

E-Cigarette Group

   A starter pack, called One Kit (Aspire, U.K. Ecig Store), was provided
   to facilitate initial use and teach participants how to use refillable
   e-cigarette products, along with one 30-ml bottle of Tobacco Royale
   flavor e-liquid purchased from U.K. Ecig Store, containing nicotine at
   a concentration of 18 mg per milliliter. The kit had a 2.1-ohm atomizer
   and 650-mAh battery. During the trial, the company discontinued this
   kit, so One Kit 2016 (Innokin, U.K. Ecig Store), with a 1.5-ohm
   atomizer and 1000-mAh battery, was used for 42 participants.
   Participants were asked to purchase their future e-liquid online or
   from local vape shops and to buy a different e-cigarette device if the
   one supplied did not meet their needs. They were encouraged to
   experiment with e-liquids of different strengths and flavors. Those who
   were unable to obtain their own supply were provided with one further
   10-ml bottle, but this was not offered proactively. Participants
   received oral and written information on how to operate the
   e-cigarette.

   The original One Kit, including five atomizers, U.K. adapter, spare
   battery, and e-liquid, was purchased wholesale for £19.40 ($26 U.S.).
   The cost of One Kit 2016, including the same extras, was £30.25 ($40
   U.S.).

   Participants in the e-cigarette group and those in the
   nicotine-replacement group were asked to sign a commitment to not use
   the nonassigned treatment for at least 4 weeks after their quit date.
   This was to minimize contamination between the trial groups.

Measures

   At trial visits, the following data were recorded: smoking status,
   expired carbon monoxide level (at baseline, 4 weeks, and 52 weeks), use
   and ratings of trial products, ratings of withdrawal symptoms (weeks 1
   through 6), adverse reactions (presence or absence of nausea, sleep
   disturbance, and throat or mouth irritation), and respiratory symptoms
   (presence or absence of shortness of breath, wheezing, cough, and
   phlegm). The Supplementary Appendix provides further details of trial
   measures.

   The primary outcome was 1-year sustained abstinence, calculated in
   accordance with the Russell Standard^9 as a self-report of smoking no
   more than five cigarettes from 2 weeks after the target quit date,
   validated biochemically by an expired carbon monoxide level of less
   than 8 ppm at 1-year follow-up and not contradicted by any previous
   self-report or validation result. Carbon monoxide validation is the
   standard measure in trials assessing nicotine-containing products (see
   the Supplementary Appendix). Participants who died (one in each group)
   were excluded. Participants who were lost to follow-up or did not
   provide biochemical validation were classified as not being abstinent
   in the primary analysis.

   Secondary abstinence outcomes included sustained abstinence from 26 to
   52 weeks, at 4 weeks, and at 26 weeks and the percentage of
   participants without sustained abstinence from 26 to 52 weeks who
   reduced their cigarette consumption by at least 50%. We also assessed
   7-day abstinence at 4, 26, and 52 weeks. In addition, we compared the
   trial groups with respect to relapse rate and time to relapse and with
   respect to the measures listed above.

Statistical Analysis

   We calculated that a sample of 886 participants would provide the trial
   with 95% power (at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05) if the true
   percentages of 1-year abstinence were 23.8% in the e-cigarette group
   and 14.0% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.7). Since
   trial setup, the abstinence rate in stop-smoking service clinics
   declined to 10%, but the sample of 886 participants would provide 85%
   power if the percentages were 17.0% and 10.0% in the respective groups.

   The primary and secondary abstinence outcomes were analyzed by
   regression of smoking status at each time point onto trial group.
   Primary analyses were adjusted for trial center to account for the
   stratification factor. In sensitivity analyses, each model was further
   adjusted for baseline covariates selected with the use of stepwise
   regression. Binary regressions were conducted by means of the
   generalized linear model with binomial distribution and logarithmic
   link to estimate the relative risk for e-cigarettes as compared with
   nicotine-replacement therapy.

   To assess the effect of missing data on the primary outcome, we
   conducted four prespecified sensitivity analyses, which excluded
   participants who did not attend at least one behavioral-support
   session, excluded participants who used the nonassigned product for at
   least 5 consecutive days, excluded participants who did not complete
   the 52-week follow-up, and imputed missing information with the use of
   multiple imputation by chained equations.^10 Missing data were imputed
   for 136 participants in each group, and 50 data sets were imputed.

   We also estimated mean differences and 95% confidence intervals between
   trial groups in product ratings and in change scores between baseline
   and follow-up time points in withdrawal symptoms, as well as
   between-group differences in the percentage of participants who had
   adverse reactions or respiratory symptoms, using binomial regression
   with adjustment for trial center (see the statistical analysis plan,
   available with the protocol at NEJM.org). Analyses were conducted with
   the use of Stata software, version 15 (StataCorp).

   and Follow-up.

   Reasons for ineligibility in 463 of the 2045 persons screened are
   detailed in Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix. Of the 438
   participants in the e-cigarette group who were included in the primary
   analysis, 3 stopped treatment and declined follow-up and 13 stopped
   treatment and permitted follow-up. Of the 446 participants in the
   nicotine-replacement group who were included in the primary analysis, 5
   stopped treatment and declined follow-up and 36 stopped treatment and
   permitted follow-up.
   Table 1. [nejmoa1808779_t1.jpeg] Table 1. Characteristics of the
   Participants at Baseline.

   A total of 2045 clients of stop-smoking services were screened, and 886
   underwent randomization (439 to the e-cigarette group and 447 to the
   nicotine-replacement group). Of the randomly assigned participants,
   78.8% completed the 52-week follow-up (Figure 1). The sample was
   composed largely of middle-aged smokers, with 40.7% entitled to free
   prescriptions (a marker of social disadvantage or poor health) (Table
   1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Effects of Treatment on Abstinence

   Table 2. [nejmoa1808779_t2.jpeg] Table 2. Abstinence Rates at Different
   Time Points and Smoking Reduction at 52 Weeks.

   The rate of sustained 1-year abstinence was 18.0% in the e-cigarette
   group and 9.9% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.83;
   95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 2.58; P<0.001) (Table 2). The
   absolute difference in the 1-year abstinence rate between the two
   groups was 8.1 percentage points, resulting in a number needed to treat
   for one additional person to have sustained abstinence of 12 (95% CI, 8
   to 27). The result did not change substantially in the four sensitivity
   analyses (relative risk, 1.75 to 1.85; P≤0.001 for all comparisons)
   (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Abstinence rates were higher
   in the e-cigarette group than in the nicotine-replacement group at all
   time points (Table 2, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).

   We conducted a post hoc analysis, in which participants with 1-year
   abstinence who used nonassigned products (see the Supplementary
   Appendix) were removed from the sample (3% [2 of 79] in the e-cigarette
   group were using nicotine replacement and 20% [9 of 44] in the
   nicotine-replacement group were using e-cigarettes). This resulted in a
   1-year abstinence rate of 17.7% in the e-cigarette group, as compared
   with 8.0% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 2.21; 95%
   CI, 1.52 to 3.22).

   Among participants in whom full abstinence was not achieved, more had a
   carbon monoxide–validated reduction of smoking by at least 50% in the
   e-cigarette group than in the nicotine-replacement group (Table 2).
   Time to relapse and relapse rates at 52 weeks among participants with
   sustained abstinence at 4 weeks did not differ substantially between
   the two trial groups (hazard ratio for time to relapse, 1.14; 95% CI,
   0.96 to 1.34; relative risk of relapse at 52 weeks, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.93
   to 1.73).

Treatment Adherence and Ratings and Effects on Withdrawal Symptoms

   Table 3. [nejmoa1808779_t3.jpeg] Table 3. Attendance and Treatment
   Adherence.

   Overall adherence was similar in the two groups, but e-cigarettes were
   used more frequently and for longer than nicotine replacement (Table
   3). In the nicotine-replacement group, 88.1% of participants used
   nicotine-replacement combinations. In the e-cigarette group,
   practically all participants used refillable e-cigarettes (Table S4 in
   the Supplementary Appendix).

   Among participants with 1-year abstinence, 80% (63 of 79) were using
   e-cigarettes at 52 weeks in the e-cigarette group and 9% (4 of 44) were
   using nicotine replacement in the nicotine-replacement group. Further
   details of product use (including the use of nonassigned products) are
   provided in the Supplementary Appendix, including Tables S4 and S5.

   Both e-cigarettes and nicotine-replacement products were perceived to
   be less satisfying than cigarettes. However, e-cigarettes provided
   greater satisfaction and were rated as more helpful to refrain from
   smoking than nicotine-replacement products (Table S6 in the
   Supplementary Appendix).
   Table 4. [nejmoa1808779_t4.jpeg] Table 4. Urges to Smoke in
   Participants with Abstinence at 1 Week or 4 Weeks after Quit Date.

   Among participants with abstinence at 1 week after their quit date as
   well as participants with abstinence at 4 weeks, those in the
   e-cigarette group had less severe urges to smoke than did those in the
   nicotine-replacement group (Table 4). They also reported a smaller
   increase from baseline in irritability, restlessness, and inability to
   concentrate than those in the nicotine-replacement group during the
   first week of abstinence. Between-group differences in hunger and
   depression were in the same direction but less substantial. By week 4,
   participants in either group who were abstinent reported little
   withdrawal discomfort (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Safety Evaluation

   Two participants died during the trial. One died from ischemic heart
   disease in the e-cigarette group and one from traumatic spine injury in
   the nicotine-replacement group.

   There were 27 serious adverse events in the e-cigarette group and 22 in
   the nicotine-replacement group (Table S8 in the Supplementary
   Appendix). No serious adverse event in either group was classified by
   the trial clinician as being related to product use, but we noted 1
   respiratory event in the nicotine-replacement group and 5 in the
   e-cigarette group (2 in participants who were smoking and not vaping, 2
   in participants who were smoking and vaping, and 1 in a participant
   whose status with respect to smoking and vaping was not known) (see the
   Supplementary Appendix).

   Of the prespecified adverse reactions of interest, nausea was reported
   more frequently in the nicotine-replacement group (37.9%, vs. 31.3% in
   the e-cigarette group) and throat or mouth irritation more frequently
   in the e-cigarette group (65.3%, vs. 51.2% in the nicotine-replacement
   group). There was little difference between the two groups in the
   percentage of participants reporting severe nausea (6.6% in the
   e-cigarette group and 6.5% in the nicotine-replacement group) or severe
   throat or mouth irritation (5.9% and 3.9%, respectively) (Tables S9 and
   S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
   Table 5. [nejmoa1808779_t5.jpeg] Table 5. Respiratory Symptoms at
   Baseline and at 52 Weeks.

   Regarding the prespecified respiratory symptoms of interest, the
   incidence of cough and phlegm production declined in both trial groups
   from baseline to 52 weeks. However, among participants who reported
   cough or phlegm at baseline, significantly more were symptom-free at
   the 52-week follow-up in the e-cigarette group than in the
   nicotine-replacement group (Table 5). To determine whether this was due
   to the higher abstinence rate in the e-cigarette group, we ran an
   exploratory analysis that controlled for abstinence status at 52 weeks.
   This did not change the results (relative risk for cough, 0.8; 95% CI,
   0.6 to 0.9; relative risk for phlegm, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9).

Discussion

   E-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than
   nicotine-replacement therapy in this randomized trial. This is
   particularly noteworthy given that nicotine replacement was used under
   expert guidance, with access to the full range of nicotine-replacement
   products and with 88.1% of participants using combination
   treatments.^11

   Our trial showed a stronger effect of e-cigarettes than previous
   trials.^5,12,13 This could be due to the inclusion of smokers seeking
   help in quitting, the provision of face-to-face support, and the use of
   refillable e-cigarettes with free choice of e-liquids. Previous trials
   provided limited or no face-to-face support and used first-generation
   cartridge products. Refillable devices are generally more efficient at
   nicotine delivery.^14

   The trial provides some indications of why e-cigarettes had better
   results than nicotine-replacement treatments. As in previous
   studies,^5,15 e-cigarettes were more effective in alleviating tobacco
   withdrawal symptoms and received better ratings than
   nicotine-replacement therapy. They may also have allowed better
   tailoring of nicotine dose to individual needs.

   The rate of continuing e-cigarette use was fairly high. This can be
   seen as problematic if e-cigarette use for a year signals ongoing
   long-term use, which may pose as-yet-unknown health risks. On the
   positive side, ongoing e-cigarette use may ameliorate withdrawal
   symptoms, such as constipation,^16 mouth ulcers,^17 and weight gain,^18
   and continue to provide some of the positive subjective effects
   previously derived from smoking.^19 Provided that ongoing e-cigarette
   use has similar effects to long-term nicotine-replacement use, for
   heavy smokers with a high risk of relapse, long-term e-cigarette use
   may also assist with preventing relapse.^20 Among participants in our
   trial in whom full abstinence was not achieved, those in the
   e-cigarette group were more likely to reduce their smoke intake than
   those in the nicotine-replacement group, but it is unclear whether this
   affects future abstinence.

   E-cigarettes caused more throat or mouth irritation, and nicotine
   replacement caused more nausea; these effects were mostly mild. There
   were mixed signals regarding the effects of e-cigarettes on the
   respiratory system. More participants in the e-cigarette group than in
   the nicotine-replacement group reported respiratory serious adverse
   events, although the difference was not significant and some of the
   affected participants were not vaping. Meanwhile, we detected positive
   effects of e-cigarette use on some respiratory outcomes. Similar
   positive effects were reported previously. A switch to e-cigarettes was
   accompanied by a reduction in respiratory infections in an online
   survey,^21 and two case studies described nonsmokers with chronic
   throat and nose infections that resolved after they started to vape.
   Antibacterial effects of propylene glycol and glycerin were suggested
   as possible explanations.^22,23 (For more on e-cigarettes and the
   respiratory system, see the Supplementary Appendix.)

   The trial had several limitations. Product assignments could not be
   blinded. Positive expectations have limited effects on long-term
   abstinence, but if nicotine replacement was seen as an inferior option,
   participants in the nicotine-replacement group could have put less
   effort into their quit attempt than those in the e-cigarette group. We
   tried to limit expectation effects by recruiting only participants with
   no strong product preference. Abstinence rates in the
   nicotine-replacement group were also at least as high as in usual
   practice^24 (see the Supplementary Appendix). Nevertheless, lack of
   blinding could affect the results. Carbon monoxide validation detects
   smoking only over the past 24 hours, so there may have been some false
   negative results. Several participants in the nicotine-replacement
   group used e-cigarettes during the trial, but this would dilute rather
   than amplify any effects of e-cigarettes. The 1-year follow-up rate of
   79% was similar to the rates of 78%,^19 79%,^5 and 75%^20 observed in
   other studies involving the same general population and setting.
   Achieving higher follow-up rates among smokers engaged in face-to-face
   treatment is difficult, because they tend to feel embarrassed if they
   do not quit, and some avoid further contact. Multiple imputation showed
   consistent results; nevertheless, incomplete follow-up represents
   another limitation of the trial.

   The findings are likely to be valid for dependent smokers who seek help
   but may not be generalizable to smokers who are less dependent or who
   try e-cigarettes for reasons other than quitting smoking. In addition,
   they may not be generalizable to less effective first-generation
   e-cigarettes. Moreover, not all service clients want e-cigarettes. In a
   previous study, 69% accepted the offer of an e-cigarette starter
   pack.^25 (For comparison, 57% of service clients opt for nicotine
   replacement and 25% for varenicline.^26)

   Further trials are needed to determine whether our results generalize
   outside the U.K. services. In addition, e-cigarette studies are needed
   that compare different levels of support. This is important for
   focusing public health messages on either encouraging smokers to switch
   to e-cigarette use within support services or recommending use with
   less intensive or no support.

   In our trial, refillable e-cigarettes had greater efficacy than
   nicotine-replacement therapy, even though nicotine replacement was
   provided in combinations and under expert guidance.

   * Abstinence at 52 weeks was defined as a self-report of smoking no
   more than five cigarettes from 2 weeks after the target quit date,
   validated biochemically by an expired carbon monoxide level of less
   than 8 ppm at 52 weeks. Abstinence between week 26 and week 52 was
   defined as a self-report of smoking no more than five cigarettes
   between week 26 and week 52, plus an expired carbon monoxide level of
   less than 8 ppm at 52 weeks. Abstinence at 4 weeks was defined as a
   self-report of no smoking from 2 weeks after the target quit date, plus
   an expired carbon monoxide level of less than 8 ppm at 4 weeks.
   Abstinence at 26 weeks was defined as a self-report of smoking no more
   than five cigarettes from 2 weeks after the target quit date to 26
   weeks; there was no validation by expired carbon monoxide level.

   † The analysis was adjusted for trial center only.

   ‡ The analysis was adjusted for trial center, marital status, age at
   smoking initiation, and score on the Fagerström Test for Cigarette
   Dependence.

   § The analysis was adjusted for trial center, age, score on the
   Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence, and age at smoking
   initiation.

   ¶ The analysis was adjusted for trial center, education level, partner
   who smokes (yes or no), and score on the Fagerström Test for Cigarette
   Dependence.

   ‖ The analysis was adjusted for trial center, sex, age, and partner who
   smokes (yes or no).

   * The maximum number of contacts was five: at the target quit date, 1
   week, 4 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 months.

   † For use of assigned products, missing information was imputed from
   the information from the next weekly behavioral-support consultation,
   if available (e.g., for missing information at consultation 3,
   information was taken from consultation 4).

   ‡ The results were similar for weeks 1 through 4.

Introduction

   Except in eastern Europe and parts of Africa, mortality among adults
   has declined in most countries for decades.^1 Lower rates of death from
   infectious diseases were the early driver of this improvement, but
   there have been subsequent declines in mortality from cardiovascular
   disease and some cancers.^2,3 There have also been important trends in
   various cancers^2 — for example, the rise and subsequent decline in
   lung-cancer incidence and mortality among men in many high-income
   countries, a decline in stomach-cancer incidence and mortality as
   economies develop, and the worldwide increase in breast-cancer
   incidence.

   The hazardous effects of behavioral and dietary risk factors on
   noncommunicable diseases, and the metabolic and physiological
   conditions that mediate their effects, have been established in
   prospective cohort studies and randomized trials. This knowledge,
   together with data from risk-factor surveillance, has helped to
   establish the mortality and disease burden attributable to risk
   factors, globally and by region and country.^4-7 There is less
   information on risk-factor trends, which makes it difficult to assess
   how they have affected population health in the past or how they may do
   so in the future.

   Disease Attributable to Selected Behavioral and Dietary Risk Factors in
   2010 and the Metabolic and Physiological Mediators of Their Hazardous
   Effects.

   High-income regions are Australasia, the Asia–Pacific region, North
   America, and western Europe. The figure shows deaths (Panel A) and
   disease burden (Panel B) attributable to the total effects of each
   individual risk factor. There is overlap among the effects of risk
   factors because of multicausality and because the effects of some risk
   factors (e.g., physical inactivity) are partly mediated through other
   risk factors (e.g., high body-mass index [BMI]). Therefore, the deaths
   and disease burden attributable to individual risk factors cannot
   simply be added together. DALYs denotes disability-adjusted life-years.
   Data are from Lim et al.^5

   In this article, we summarize the available data on trends in selected
   behavioral and dietary risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and
   examine the effects they have had, or may have in the future, on the
   health of populations around the world. Risk factors such as smoking,
   alcohol consumption, excess weight, and dietary factors are responsible
   for a large share of the global disease burden, directly or through
   conditions such as high blood pressure and elevated blood glucose and
   cholesterol levels (Figure 1).^4,5

Smoking

   The hazardous effects of smoking on mortality from cancers and
   cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been known for decades.
   Effects on other globally important diseases such as diabetes^8 and
   tuberculosis^9 have also been shown. In parallel, evidence of the
   hazards of smoking in Asian countries has established that it is a
   global problem.^10-12 Moreover, exposure of pregnant women, children,
   and nonpregnant adults to secondhand smoke at home and in public places
   is associated with adverse birth outcomes, childhood respiratory
   diseases, and many of the same diseases that are associated with active
   smoking.^13
   Figure 2. [nejmra1203528_f2.jpeg] Figure 2. Trends in Lung-Cancer
   Mortality and Prevalence of Daily Tobacco Smoking in 2008.

   Panels A and B show trends in age-standardized mortality from lung
   cancer among men and women, respectively, 30 years of age or older.
   Death rates are age-standardized to the World Health Organization (WHO)
   standard population. Data are from the WHO database of vital
   statistics, with adjustment for completeness of death registration and
   for validity and comparability of cause-of-death assignment. Panel C
   shows the age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco smoking among
   adults in 2008, according to WHO region. Data are from the WHO.^14

   In most Western high-income countries, the prevalence of smoking
   increased among men in the first half of the 20th century and peaked in
   the post–World War II decades, with 80% of men having smoked at some
   point in their adult lives. Smoking among men subsequently declined in
   English-speaking countries and in northern Europe, followed by more
   than two decades of decline in age-standardized mortality from lung
   cancer (Figure 2A) and in deaths from other diseases attributable to
   smoking.^15 The prevalence of smoking among women rose throughout the
   second half of the 20th century, first in English-speaking countries
   and northern European countries, then in Japan and countries in Latin
   America and central and southern Europe. The more recent declines in
   the United Kingdom, North America, and Australia are beginning to
   translate into a plateau or decline in lung-cancer mortality (Figure
   2B) and in smoking-attributable deaths from other diseases among
   women.^15 However, lung-cancer mortality continues to rise among
   continental European women (Figure 2B).

   The majority of the more than 1 billion smokers worldwide now live in
   low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of smoking has fallen
   below 20% in Australia and Canada but has plateaued at high levels
   among men and women in central and eastern Europe, among women in some
   western and southern European countries, and among men in East Asia
   (Figure 2C).^14 An estimated 60% of men in some countries in eastern
   Europe and East Asia smoke. The prevalence of smoking among women is
   still highest in Western societies, with a prevalence of about 40% in
   some European countries.^14 The prevalence of smoking remains
   relatively low in sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 2C), and smokers there
   tend to smoke fewer cigarettes than do their Western and Asian
   counterparts.

   In addition to shifting patterns of smoking prevalence, there have been
   changes in the type of cigarettes available, including the introduction
   of “low-tar” and “light” cigarettes. A recent review concluded that
   “five decades of evolving cigarette design had not reduced overall
   disease risk among smokers.”^16 Prevention and cessation remain the
   only effective public health measures to reduce the harmful effects of
   smoking.

   Tobacco smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke together are
   responsible for about 6.3 million annual deaths worldwide and 6.3% of
   the global burden of disease, mostly in low- and middle-income
   countries (Figure 1).^5 The death toll from smoking is especially large
   in eastern Europe, where the prevalence of smoking and the prevalence
   of other cardiovascular risk factors are concurrently high; this death
   toll is increasing in the large populations of Asia and slowly
   declining in Western countries. In addition to smoking, oral tobacco
   use and betel-nut chewing are highly prevalent in South Asia and are
   responsible for a large number of cases of oral cancer and deaths from
   this disease.^17

Alcohol Consumption

   Alcohol consumption is associated with numerous diseases and injuries.
   Moderate alcohol consumption has been inversely associated with the
   risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, although the benefits may
   be greater for persons with existing cardiovascular risk factors than
   for those without such risk factors.^18 Epidemiologic studies that have
   measured both the amount and patterns of alcohol consumption have shown
   that heavy episodic (or binge) drinking not only substantially raises
   the risk of injuries but can also increase the risk of or exacerbate
   cardiovascular disease and liver disease.^19-21
   Figure 3. [nejmra1203528_f3.jpeg] Figure 3. Trends in Recorded Per
   Capita Alcohol Consumption by Adults in Selected Countries.

   In addition to recorded consumption, there is unrecorded consumption in
   some countries. For example, in 2005, adult per capita unrecorded
   consumption was estimated to be less than 0.5 liters per year in Japan
   and France; 1 to 2 liters per year in China, the United Kingdom, and
   the United States; and close to 5 liters per year in Russia. Data are
   from the WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health
   (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.GISAH).

   Although cultural factors are important determinants of alcohol
   consumption, including harmful drinking, social change and policy
   interventions have modified alcohol-drinking behaviors in some
   countries.^22,23 For example, per capita alcohol consumption has
   decreased by about one half in traditional wine-producing and
   wine-drinking countries such as Italy and France during the past few
   decades^22,23; during the same period, it has doubled in the United
   Kingdom and Denmark, and levels of consumption in the two groups of
   countries have converged (Figure 3). Alcohol consumption has increased
   steadily in Japan, China, and many other countries in Asia, where it
   was previously low.

   Alcohol consumption is responsible for about 2.7 million annual deaths
   and 3.9% of the global burden of disease (Figure 1).^5 The major
   contributors to the alcohol-attributable disease burden are cancers,
   chronic liver disease, unintentional injuries, alcohol-related
   violence, neuropsychiatric conditions, and, in some regions (especially
   eastern Europe) that have a high prevalence of binge and harmful
   drinking, a large death toll from cardiovascular diseases.^4,5,24,25
   The role of alcohol consumption in injuries and violence among young
   adults and in nonfatal neuropsychiatric conditions makes its
   contribution to the disease burden larger than its contribution to
   mortality, relative to other risk factors for noncommunicable diseases
   (Figure 1).

   Alcohol consumption is the leading single cause of the disease burden
   in eastern Europe and is one of the top three risk factors, along with
   high blood pressure and overweight or obesity, in much of Latin
   America, where it ranks ahead of smoking.^4,5,7 The effects of alcohol
   on population health are greatest in Russia and some other former
   Soviet republics. Though recorded per capita alcohol consumption in
   Russia is the same as or only slightly higher than consumption in
   western European countries, the health effects are substantially
   larger. In traditional wine-producing countries, most alcohol is
   consumed as wine during meals, in relatively modest daily amounts, by a
   large proportion of the population. In contrast, in Russia and
   neighboring countries, men (especially those of low socioeconomic
   status) consume very large amounts of spirits, either as a regular
   daily habit or by binge drinking. A substantial proportion of consumed
   alcohol is from unrecorded and nonbeverage sources such as medicinal
   and industrial ethanol. Alcohol consumption may be responsible for one
   third to one half of deaths among young and middle-aged men in
   Russia.^24,26 In contrast to the current, enormous death toll,
   mortality declined temporarily in the 1980s, when policies introduced
   under Mikhail Gorbachev reduced alcohol consumption by about one half
   (Figure 3).^25

Excess Weight and Obesity

   Numerous observational studies in Western and Asian populations have
   associated different measures of adiposity and excess body weight with
   increased total mortality and increased risks of disease or death from
   diabetes, ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke, cancers, chronic
   kidney disease, and osteoarthritis.^27-32 The risks of diabetes and
   ischemic heart disease increase monotonically with an increase in the
   body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of
   the height in meters), starting at a BMI in the low 20s. In contrast,
   the association with hemorrhagic stroke, which is more common in Asian
   populations than in other populations, has been observed only at a BMI
   of 25 or higher.^27,31 Currently, excess weight is responsible for
   about 3.4 million annual deaths and 3.8% of the global burden of
   disease, with diseases that have low mortality and long periods of
   disability, such as diabetes and musculoskeletal diseases, accounting
   for a proportion of this burden (Figure 1).^5
   Figure 4. [nejmra1203528_f4.jpeg] Figure 4. Trends in the Number of
   Obese Persons, According to Region.

   Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher. High-income North America
   includes Canada and the United States; high-income Asia–Pacific
   includes Brunei, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. See Fig. S1 in the
   Supplementary Appendix for the rise in BMI by country. Data are from
   Stevens et al.^33

   In recent decades, men and women in all but a few countries have gained
   weight, with the age-standardized mean BMI increasing by more than 2
   units per decade in some Pacific islands (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary
   Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). In
   high-income regions, the BMI is higher in English-speaking countries
   than in continental Europe and the Asia–Pacific region, especially for
   women. The global prevalence of obesity (defined as a BMI ≥30) doubled
   between 1980 and 2008, to 9.8% among men and 13.8% among women —
   equivalent to more than half a billion obese people worldwide (205
   million men and 297 million women) (Figure 4).^33,34 An additional 950
   million adults have a BMI of 25 to less than 30. The United States has
   had the largest absolute increase in the number of obese people since
   1980, followed by China, Brazil, and Mexico.^33 Currently, the
   age-standardized mean BMI ranges from less than 22 in parts of
   sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to 30 to 35 in some Pacific islands and
   countries in the Middle East and North Africa.^34 The prevalence of
   obesity ranges from less than 2% in Bangladesh to more than 60% in some
   Pacific islands.^33

Diet and Nutrition

   Centuries after the effects of specific dietary intakes on conditions
   such as scurvy were discovered, nutritional epidemiology has
   established the associations of specific foods and nutrients or overall
   dietary patterns with cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and
   diabetes^35,36 and with intermediate outcomes such as weight gain,
   increased blood pressure, and insulin resistance and
   hyperglycemia.^37-39 The large body of observational studies is
   increasingly complemented by well-designed randomized trials that have,
   for example, shown the benefits of lower salt intake, the replacement
   of saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats, and healthy dietary
   patterns.^37,38,40,41 Low dietary intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole
   grains, or nuts and seeds or a high dietary intake of salt are
   individually responsible for 1.5% to more than 4% of the global disease
   burden (Figure 1).^5
   Figure 5. [nejmra1203528_f5.jpeg] Figure 5. Trends in Composite Dietary
   Scores in Selected Countries.

   Each dietary score is a composite indicator that captures the
   availability of 21 food types in the United Nations Food and
   Agriculture Organization food balance sheets. A high Diet 1 score
   (Panel A) indicates a high availability of sugars; meat, animal
   products, animal fats, milk, and eggs; and total calories, as well as a
   low availability of pulses (legumes) and cereals. A high Diet 2 score
   (Panel B) indicates a high availability of nuts; fruits, vegetables,
   and vegetable oils; cereals; and total calories. A high Diet 3 score
   (Panel C) indicates a high availability of fish, aquatic products, and
   oil crops (e.g., soybeans, coconuts, and olives) and a relatively low
   availability of milk and pulses. Scores were calculated with the use of
   principal-component analysis, an approach that aggregates food types on
   the basis of the degree of correlation to each other within the data
   set.^43,44 Because principal components do not have a directly
   interpretable scale, we used percentiles of values (smoothed using a
   5-year moving average) for presentation. The re-scaled values therefore
   range from 0% (lowest value observed in any country in the world
   between 1970 and 2009) to 100% (highest value observed in any country
   in the world between 1970 and 2009).

   There have so far been few population-based analyses of trends in
   specific dietary risk factors. Administrative data, such as the United
   Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food balance sheets,
   provide a broad picture of dietary patterns and trends based on the
   availability of different food types for human consumption. FAO data
   show that consumption of animal fats and high-calorie foods is
   increasing in Mediterranean countries, such as Greece, but declining
   slightly in Nordic countries and New Zealand,^42 with consumption in
   these countries converging at similar levels (Figure 5A). These changes
   may also partly explain trends in serum cholesterol levels, which have
   declined more rapidly in Nordic countries and New Zealand than in
   southern Europe, with cholesterol levels now lower in Sweden and
   Finland than in Italy.^45 Dietary change has been even more drastic in
   parts of Asia, with China rapidly adopting a Western, animal-based diet
   (Figure 5A) and having one of the largest worldwide increases in serum
   cholesterol levels.^45

   Parallel to this westernization trend, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and
   cereals have become more available in Nordic and English-speaking
   Western countries and in Asia, partly because technological and
   economic developments have increased year-around availability through
   expanded production, imports, and storage capacity (Figure 5B).
   Similarly, there has been a modest increase in the availability of fish
   and other marine products in some Western and Asian countries (Figure
   5C).

   The FAO data, which are based on agricultural production and trade
   statistics, do not capture food waste or subsistence production, nor do
   they account for food processing. For example, these data do not
   include specific information about consumption of refined flour versus
   whole grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, and partially hydrogenated
   vegetables oils (and hence trans-fat consumption), all of which are
   important dietary risk factors. The FAO databases also do not record
   consumption of salt, which is common in the diets of countries at all
   stages of economic development.^46 A high intake of salt is a risk
   factor for stomach cancer and also for elevated blood pressure, which
   in turn increases the risk of stroke, other cardiovascular diseases,
   chronic kidney disease, and kidney cancer. A decrease in dietary salt
   in Japan and Finland, countries in which salt intake was previously
   more than 20 g per day in some areas, has been associated with a
   decline in rates of stomach cancer and hemorrhagic stroke.^47,48

Physical Activity

   Studies of the beneficial health effects of physical activity date back
   to the 1950s^49 and have been replicated in large cohorts.^50 Physical
   activity at work, walking, and, in some populations, bicycling used to
   be major contributors to total energy expenditure but have declined
   dramatically in industrial and urban societies. Paralleling this shift,
   more recent epidemiologic studies in high-income countries have focused
   on leisure-time activity, with less emphasis on work and methods of
   local transportation, which are important in developing countries.^51
   Only recently has attention been given to population-based measurement
   of physical activity in countries at all stages of urbanization and
   economic development. The limited available global data nonetheless
   show low levels of activity and long periods in sedentary conditions in
   high-income and urbanized countries and higher activity levels in rural
   populations that engage in agricultural activity and walk or bicycle
   long distances for daily activities.

The Global Risk-Factor Transition

   Thus far, the epidemiologic transition has been viewed as a process
   through which the share of noncommunicable diseases as causes of death
   increases with declining mortality and rising longevity. As
   population-based data on medical causes of death and, more recently, on
   risk factors have become available, a more complete picture of the
   epidemiologic transition is emerging — one in which the interplay among
   risk factors and medical care leads to distinct disease patterns in
   different populations, with variations even among noncommunicable
   diseases.^2 Despite this diversity, an increasingly salient feature of
   risk-factor transitions is that many behavioral and dietary risks, and
   their metabolic and physiological mediators, that have been prominent
   in high-income countries are now at the same or higher levels in low-
   and middle-income countries.^44 This pattern parallels the higher
   prevalence of most risk factors and higher mortality from
   noncommunicable diseases in lower socioeconomic groups than in higher
   socioeconomic groups within high-income countries.^52

   Knowledge of risk-factor trends provides a more complete picture of the
   epidemiologic transition as well as lessons for how the risk factors
   can be reduced and managed in countries at all levels of economic
   development, with the use of various preventive strategies.^2 From a
   public health perspective, smoking is currently the most
   policy-responsive behavioral risk factor, with major successes in
   tobacco control in a number of high- and middle-income countries but
   with a shifting burden to low- and middle-income nations. Harmful
   alcohol consumption has been curbed in some Western countries but
   remains a major public health burden or is even worsening in others,
   especially in eastern Europe and Latin America.^25 Curbing its current
   harms and preventing its rise in Asia and other developing regions with
   the use of interventions known to be effective^2 should be a priority.

   Although dietary patterns are shaped by cultural, environmental,
   technological, and economic factors, they can also be modified through
   mechanisms that range from broad food and agricultural policies to
   targeted pricing and regulatory interventions related to specific
   harmful or beneficial dietary components. Such mechanisms are reviewed
   elsewhere.^2,53

   The availability of population-based and personal interventions for
   tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and elevated blood
   pressure or lipid levels has made overweight, obesity, and high blood
   glucose levels the wild cards of noncommunicable-disease risks
   globally. Some have argued that the obesity epidemic may reverse
   life-expectancy gains in high-income nations.^54 At the same time,
   blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which partially mediate the
   hazardous effects of excess weight on cardiovascular diseases, have
   declined in most high-income countries and in parts of Latin
   America.^43,45 This has probably helped dampen or delay the effects of
   weight gain on cardiovascular diseases, which have declined
   impressively in industrialized countries.^55 However, there are
   currently few effective measures against the harms of overweight and
   obesity with respect to hyperglycemia, diabetes, and cancers, making
   the concurrent epidemic of diabetes a global health challenge.^56
   Randomized trials of dietary changes (in some cases combined with
   exercise) have shown moderate weight-loss benefits for up to 2
   years,^57 but the long-term and large-scale community effectiveness of
   such interventions has not been established.^58 Similarly, studies have
   modeled or qualitatively assessed the potential benefits of
   physical-activity interventions,^59 but the empirical evidence of their
   effectiveness at the population level remains limited. As a result,
   policy options and recommendations for weight control^60 and increased
   physical activity remain broad and untested but are needed to avoid a
   slowdown or even reversal of the progress in mortality reduction.^2

   Although the behaviors of individuals are important factors in the
   patterns of risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, successful
   efforts to reduce smoking, alcohol consumption, and, more recently,
   trans-fat and salt consumption show that there is great scope for
   collective action through policy formulation and implementation.^2
   Successful policies, such as tobacco and alcohol taxes and
   restrictions, should be replicated in all populations. There is also a
   need for bold and creative policies that address harmful alcohol
   consumption, improve diet, and increase physical activity.

       Figure 1. Deaths and Burden of Disease Attributable to Selected
       Behavioral and Dietary Risk Factors in 2010 and the Metabolic and
       Physiological Mediators of Their Hazardous Effects.
       High-income regions are Australasia, the Asia–Pacific region, North
       America, and western Europe. The figure shows deaths (Panel A) and
       disease burden (Panel B) attributable to the total effects of each
       individual risk factor. There is overlap among the effects of risk
       factors because of multicausality and because the effects of some
       risk factors (e.g., physical inactivity) are partly mediated
       through other risk factors (e.g., high body-mass index [BMI]).
       Therefore, the deaths and disease burden attributable to individual
       risk factors cannot simply be added together. DALYs denotes
       disability-adjusted life-years. Data are from Lim et al.^5

       Figure 2. Trends in Lung-Cancer Mortality and Prevalence of Daily
       Tobacco Smoking in 2008.
       Panels A and B show trends in age-standardized mortality from lung
       cancer among men and women, respectively, 30 years of age or older.
       Death rates are age-standardized to the World Health Organization
       (WHO) standard population. Data are from the WHO database of vital
       statistics, with adjustment for completeness of death registration
       and for validity and comparability of cause-of-death assignment.
       Panel C shows the age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco
       smoking among adults in 2008, according to WHO region. Data are
       from the WHO.^14

       Figure 3. Trends in Recorded Per Capita Alcohol Consumption by
       Adults in Selected Countries.
       In addition to recorded consumption, there is unrecorded
       consumption in some countries. For example, in 2005, adult per
       capita unrecorded consumption was estimated to be less than 0.5
       liters per year in Japan and France; 1 to 2 liters per year in
       China, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and close to 5
       liters per year in Russia. Data are from the WHO Global Information
       System on Alcohol and Health
       (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.GISAH).

       Figure 4. Trends in the Number of Obese Persons, According to
       Region.
       Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher. High-income North
       America includes Canada and the United States; high-income
       Asia–Pacific includes Brunei, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.
       See Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix for the rise in BMI by
       country. Data are from Stevens et al.^33
    5. Figure 5. Trends in Composite Dietary Scores in Selected Countries.
       [nejmra1203528_f5.jpeg]
       Figure 5. Trends in Composite Dietary Scores in Selected Countries.
       Each dietary score is a composite indicator that captures the
       availability of 21 food types in the United Nations Food and
       Agriculture Organization food balance sheets. A high Diet 1 score
       (Panel A) indicates a high availability of sugars; meat, animal
       products, animal fats, milk, and eggs; and total calories, as well
       as a low availability of pulses (legumes) and cereals. A high Diet
       2 score (Panel B) indicates a high availability of nuts; fruits,
       vegetables, and vegetable oils; cereals; and total calories. A high
       Diet 3 score (Panel C) indicates a high availability of fish,
       aquatic products, and oil crops (e.g., soybeans, coconuts, and
       olives) and a relatively low availability of milk and pulses.
       Scores were calculated with the use of principal-component
       analysis, an approach that aggregates food types on the basis of
       the degree of correlation to each other within the data set.^43,44
       Because principal components do not have a directly interpretable
       scale, we used percentiles of values (smoothed using a 5-year
       moving average) for presentation. The re-scaled values therefore
       range from 0% (lowest value observed in any country in the world
       between 1970 and 2009) to 100% (highest value observed in any
       country in the world between 1970 and 2009).

Pathology of Vaping-Associated Lung Injury

To the Editor:

   Figure 1. [nejmc1913069_f1.jpeg] Figure 1. Histopathology of Acute Lung
   Injury Associated with Vaping.

   Most cases showed airway-centered acute lung injury (Panel A), often
   with severe bronchiolitis accompanied by marked mucosal edema,
   sloughing of bronchiolar epithelium, and peribronchiolar organization
   (Panel B). All cases showed accumulation of foamy or vacuolated
   macrophages in peribronchiolar airspaces with pneumocyte vacuolization
   (Panel C). Four cases showed severe injury, with diffuse alveolar
   damage and hyaline membranes (Panel D); two of these patients died.

   Despite the accumulating data on the clinical and imaging features of
   vaping-associated lung injury,^1,2 its pathology is poorly understood.
   We reviewed lung biopsies from 17 patients (13 men; median age, 35
   years [range, 19–67]), all of whom had a history of vaping (71% with
   marijuana or cannabis oils) and were clinically suspected to have
   vaping-associated lung injury. Presentation was acute or subacute in
   all cases, with bilateral pulmonary opacities; all but two patients
   presented in 2019. Eleven met the criteria for a “confirmed” diagnosis
   of vaping-related lung injury; the remaining six met the criteria for a
   “probable” designation. In all cases, histopathological findings showed
   patterns of acute lung injury, including acute fibrinous pneumonitis,
   diffuse alveolar damage, or organizing pneumonia, usually
   bronchiolocentric and accompanied by bronchiolitis (Figure 1; also see
   the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter
   at NEJM.org). No histologic findings were specific, but foamy
   macrophages and pneumocyte vacuolization were seen in all cases and may
   be useful diagnostic clues in an appropriate clinical context.
   Pigmented macrophages were sometimes present but were never a dominant
   feature. Neutrophils were often prominent, but eosinophils were rare
   and granulomas were not seen. In two cases, bronchioloalveolar lavage
   fluid was available and contained abundant foamy macrophages. Despite
   treatment with glucocorticoids and maximum supportive care, two
   patients with diffuse alveolar damage died.

   To date, few reports of vaping-associated lung injury have included
   histopathological findings. Our cases corroborate many of these
   descriptions and provide some preliminary insight into the pathogenesis
   of this injury. Much recent attention has been given to the possibility
   that vaping-associated lung injury may represent exogenous lipoid
   pneumonia.^3 However, none of our cases showed histologic evidence of
   exogenous lipoid pneumonia and no radiologic evidence thereof has been
   found^2; this calls into question the diagnostic utility of identifying
   lipid-laden macrophages or performing oil red O staining on
   bronchioloalveolar lavage fluid as a marker of vaping-associated lung
   injury, as has been proposed.^3,4 The significance of this observation
   remains unclear, particularly in patients with a known vaping history;
   until more data accumulate, our observations suggest that this finding
   should be interpreted with caution, as it may simply be a marker of
   exposure and not necessarily a marker of toxicity. Although it is
   difficult to discount the potential role of lipid, we believe that the
   histologic changes instead suggest that vaping-associated lung injury
   represents a form of airway-centered chemical pneumonitis from one or
   more inhaled toxic substances rather than exogenous lipoid pneumonia as
   such, but the agents responsible remain unknown.

A Controlled Trial of a Prostacyclin and rt-PA in the Treatment of Severe
Frostbite

   This article has no abstract; the first 100 words appear below.

   To the Editor: Many alternatives have been proposed for the treatment
   of frostbite: hemodilution, platelet-aggregation inhibitors,
   low-molecular-weight heparin, alpha-adrenergic vasodilators,
   calcium-channel inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents,
   prostacyclin analogues, fibrinolytic agents, and hyperbaric oxygen.
   None have been assessed in prospective randomized trials. Small
   retrospective studies^1^^3 suggest the efficacy of thrombolysis or
   prostacyclin analogues against spasm and thrombosis.Between 1996 and
   2008, we randomly assigned 47 patients (44 men and 3 women) with severe
   frostbite to one of three treatment regimens in an open-label study.
   Severe frostbite was defined as having at least one digit (finger or
   toe) with frostbite stage 3 . . .

            Vietnam G.B. Marks and Others publication image
            Tuberculosis transmission continues to be a major public
            health challenge. In this cluster-randomized, controlled trial
            conducted in Vietnam, active community-wide screening for
            tuberculosis over 4 years is shown to decrease the prevalence
            of tuberculosis.

            Patients with stable coronary artery disease and diabetes were
            randomly assigned to receive either ticagrelor plus aspirin or
            placebo plus aspirin. At 40 months, the incidence of the
            composite efficacy outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial
            infarction, or stroke was lower with ticagrelor than with
            placebo; the frequency of major bleeding was higher with
            ticagrelor.

            and bilateral pulmonary opacities that led to a clinical
            diagnosis of vaping-associated lung injury. The lung
            histopathology is described, along with some preliminary
            insights into the pathogenesis of acute lung injury.

            Cardiac Arrest with Nonshockable Rhythm J.-B. Lascarrou and
            Others
            Patients who were comatose after resuscitation from cardiac
            arrest with a nonshockable rhythm were randomly assigned to
            moderate therapeutic hypothermia (33°C) or targeted
            normothermia (37°C). Therapeutic hypothermia improved survival
            with a favorable neurologic outcome at 90 days.

            tuberculosis in pregnant women with HIV infection was
            assessed. Intrapartum isoniazid treatment resulted in a higher
            incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes than treatment during
            the postpartum period.

            Whether an increase in the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids or
            the addition of long-acting beta-agonists will lead to better
            outcomes in black children with moderate asthma is not known.
            Surprisingly, the data showed that increased doses of an
            inhaled glucocorticoid were as effective as addition of a
            LABA.

            Inflammation appears to play a role in atherosclerosis,
            raising the possibility that treatments that reduce
            inflammation could prevent cardiovascular events. In a
            randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 4745 patients
            with recent myocardial infarction, low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg
            once daily) prevented ischemic cardiovascular events.

            reduced leaflet motion at 90 days were less common with
            rivaroxaban. However, in the main trial, rivaroxaban was
            associated with a higher risk of death or thromboembolic
            complications and a higher risk of bleeding.

            assigned to an LDL cholesterol target of less than 70 mg per
            deciliter or to a target range of 90 to 110 mg per deciliter.
            At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the incidence of a
            composite cardiovascular end point was 12% lower in the
            lower-target group than in the higher-target group. The

            When his home palliative care patient asks him to sing for
            her, the physician hesitates. Boundary crossings create
            uncertainty and risk shifting the focus from the patient to
            the physician. Yet patients want physicians who aren’t robots,
            who are friendly and relatable.

            Pancytopenia and Rash M.V. Maus and Others publication image
            A 66-year-old man presented to the hospital for evaluation of
            pancytopenia and rash. Examination was notable for a scaling,
            erythematous rash on the legs and the absence of
            lymphadenopathy. Positron-emission tomography revealed
            increased ^18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the spleen. What
            is the diagnosis?

            Management of serum cholesterol level is a central objective
            in preventing cardiovascular events. Current guidelines
            recommend calculation of cardiovascular risk, with treatment
            decisions based on these data and clinician–patient discussion
            of risk. Statins remain the first line of pharmacotherapy.

            Acute severe hypertension accompanied by acute target-organ
            injury (hypertensive emergency) requires immediate treatment
            with IV antihypertensive agents (based on the type of
            target-organ damage) in an ICU. In the absence of target-organ
            injury, treatment involves oral medication in the ambulatory
            setting.

            Obstruction A. Eskander, J.R. de Almeida, and J.C. Irish
            Acute upper airway obstruction has varied causes with distinct
            pathophysiological features. High-flow oxygen remains the
            basis for management, but improvements in equipment have
            increased the chances of success. Advances in anesthetic and
            surgical technologies are also improving success rates.

          + Clinical Problem-Solving Double Trouble C. Smith and Others
            publication image
            A 51-year-old man presented with a 4-week history of cough
            associated with fever, chills, fatigue, and aching in the
            joints. The cough was initially productive of blood-tinged
            phlegm but later became dry. His condition had not improved
            after two courses of macrolide antibiotic therapy. What is the
            diagnosis?

            Zielinski-Gutiérrez, and S.B. Lucas publication image
            A striking trend in medical education and practice over the
            past half century has been the decline in the rate of
            autopsies conducted throughout much of the world. But there is
            much we can learn from the dead, for both clinical and public
            health purposes.

          + Perspective Last Song J. Wales
            When his home palliative care patient asks him to sing for
            her, the physician hesitates. Boundary crossings create
            uncertainty and risk shifting the focus from the patient to
            the physician. Yet patients want physicians who aren’t robots,
            who are friendly and relatable.
