Exclusive: Quentin Tarantino Working with Jerrod Carmichael on ‘Django/Zorro’
Movie

   Quentin Tarantino has tapped Jerrod Carmichael to co-write a
   Django/Zorro movie based on the crossover comic book series of the same
   name, multiple sources tell Collider.. Written by Tarantino and
   released by Dynamite Entertainment and DC Comics, the series served as
   a sequel to the director’s 2012 movie Django Unchained starring Jamie
   Foxx.

   The story takes place several years after the events of Django
   Unchained. Django is still a bounty hunter, and since there’s a warrant
   on his head back east, he has mainly been plying his trade in the
   western states. After safely settling his wife, Broomhilda, near
   Chicago, he takes to the road once again, sending her funds whenever he
   completes a job. It’s by sheer chance that he encounters the aged and
   sophisticated Diego de la Vega — the famed Zorro — and soon finds
   himself fascinated by this unusual character, who can also hold his own
   in a fight. It’s not long before Django becomes Diego’s ‘bodyguard’ and
   joins him on a mission to free the local indigenous people from
   slavery.

   django-zorro-comic Word of the project first surfaced in the wake of
   the 2014 Sony hack, which revealed several email exchanges between
   Tarantino and then-Sony boss Amy Pascal. One email from Tarantino
   read, “D/Z could be really fun!” and Pascal described the series as
   “super cool.” Since then, Collider has heard from multiple sources that
   the film adaptation is real and that Carmichael is working on the
   script, though they differ on whether he’s writing it on his own with
   oversight from Tarantino, or co-writing with Quentin himself as well as
   another, as-yet-unidentified writer. While it’s unclear whether the
   Django/Zorro project is officially set up at Sony, the studio did
   handle the international release of Django Unchained and is releasing
   Tarantino’s latest film, Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood starring
   Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, though it’s entirely possible that
   Tarantino is developing the project on his own, and will merely give
   Sony first dibs given their recent history together. Sony had no
   comment.

   It also remains unclear whether Tarantino would direct the project
   himself, though he has said in the past that he intends to retire
   following his tenth film, and as someone who has followed his career
   closely, I have a hard time believing he’d end it with Django/Zorro.
   No, I’d wager that he’ll simply wind up producing Django/Zorro should
   it ultimately come to fruition, though he’ll no doubt hand-pick the
   filmmaker himself. Of course, it’s worth noting that Tarantino rarely
   produces movies that he doesn’t direct, though he has served as an
   executive producer on Eli Roth‘s Hostel movies, as well as films
   directed by his pals Robert Rodriguez and Roger Avary. Tarantino is
   represented by WME, and a representative for the filmmaker declined to
   comment.

   Carmichael is the standup comic who created The Carmichael Show, which
   earned raves for the way it handled sensitive topics, including race.
   He’s now an executive producer on Hulu’s original comedy series Ramy.
   Carmichael is also co-writing the 48 Hours remake with the Safdie
   Brothers, and he has been developing his own directorial debut titled
   On the Count of Three, in which he’s slated to star
   alongside Christopher Abbott. He’s represented by UTA, and a
   representative for the multi-hyphenate did not immediately respond to a
   request for comment.

   slavery.

   django-zorro-comic Word of the project first surfaced in the wake of
   the 2014 Sony hack, which revealed several email exchanges between
   Tarantino and then-Sony boss Amy Pascal. One email from Tarantino
   read, “D/Z could be really fun!” and Pascal described the series as
   “super cool.” Since then, Collider has heard from multiple sources that
   the film adaptation is real and that Carmichael is working on the
   script, though they differ on whether he’s writing it on his own with
   oversight from Tarantino, or co-writing with Quentin himself as well as
   another, as-yet-unidentified writer. While it’s unclear whether the
   Django/Zorro project is officially set up at Sony, the studio did
   handle the international release of Django Unchained and is releasing
   Tarantino’s latest film, Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood starring
   Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, though it’s entirely possible that
   Tarantino is developing the project on his own, and will merely give
   Sony first dibs given their recent history together. Sony had no
   comment.

   It also remains unclear whether Tarantino would direct the project
   himself, though he has said in the past that he intends to retire
   following his tenth film, and as someone who has followed his career
   closely, I have a hard time believing he’d end it with Django/Zorro.
   No, I’d wager that he’ll simply wind up producing Django/Zorro should
   it ultimately come to fruition, though he’ll no doubt hand-pick the
   filmmaker himself. Of course, it’s worth noting that Tarantino rarely
   produces movies that he doesn’t direct, though he has served as an
   executive producer on Eli Roth‘s Hostel movies, as well as films
   directed by his pals Robert Rodriguez and Roger Avary. Tarantino is
   represented by WME, and a representative for the filmmaker declined to
   comment.

   Carmichael is the standup comic who created The Carmichael Show, which
   earned raves for the way it handled sensitive topics, including race.
   He’s now an executive producer on Hulu’s original comedy series Ramy.
   Carmichael is also co-writing the 48 Hours remake with the Safdie
   Brothers, and he has been developing his own directorial debut titled
   On the Count of Three, in which he’s slated to star
   alongside Christopher Abbott. He’s represented by UTA, and a
   representative for the multi-hyphenate did not immediately respond to a
   request for comment.

Exclusive: Quentin Tarantino Working with Jerrod Carmichael on ‘Django/Zorro’
Movie

by Jeff Sneider     June 3, 2019

   Quentin Tarantino has tapped Jerrod Carmichael to co-write a
   Django/Zorro movie based on the crossover comic book series of the same
   name, multiple sources tell Collider.. Written by Tarantino and
   released by Dynamite Entertainment and DC Comics, the series served as
   a sequel to the director’s 2012 movie Django Unchained starring Jamie
   Foxx.

   The story takes place several years after the events of Django
   Unchained. Django is still a bounty hunter, and since there’s a warrant
   on his head back east, he has mainly been plying his trade in the
   western states. After safely settling his wife, Broomhilda, near
   Chicago, he takes to the road once again, sending her funds whenever he
   completes a job. It’s by sheer chance that he encounters the aged and
   sophisticated Diego de la Vega — the famed Zorro — and soon finds
   himself fascinated by this unusual character, who can also hold his own
   in a fight. It’s not long before Django becomes Diego’s ‘bodyguard’ and
   joins him on a mission to free the local indigenous people from
   slavery.

   django-zorro-comic Word of the project first surfaced in the wake of
   the 2014 Sony hack, which revealed several email exchanges between
   Tarantino and then-Sony boss Amy Pascal. One email from Tarantino

   “super cool.” Since then, Collider has heard from multiple sources that
