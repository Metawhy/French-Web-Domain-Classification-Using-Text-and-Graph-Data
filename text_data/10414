       Orange Memorial Park Architect/Firm
       Marcy Wong & Donn Logan Architects
       Description
       Orange Memorial Park in San Francisco is the context for the new
       6,400 sq. ft. recreation building which is encircled by soccer,
       basketball, picnic and other outdoor amenities. The recreation
       building is conceived as a pavilion in a park and an icon for the
       community. Towards that goal, the use of natural materials that are
       sustainable, that have a sense of quality and longevity, that are
       complementary to each other and to the park context, and that are
       attractive, was of fundamental importance both to the designers and
       the client. For that reason, wood - in particular Western Red Cedar
       – and natural basalt stone are two of the most prominent materials
       in the building's materials palette. Western Red Cedar wood grilles
       form a rain screen of longevity and beauty for the walls, while
       evoking the sense of lightness, transparency and horizontality.

Industry Solutions

   Electronic devices and appliances have become an integral part of our
   lives. Whether traveling in car, RV or boat, during camping and other
   outdoor events, in a roadside emergency or home power outage, we depend
   on electronic equipment. Dependence on these tools has increased the
   need for mobile power solutions that enable their use anytime, anytime.

   Xantrex designs, manufactures and markets power products that are used
   when on the move to provide auxiliary or emergency power. Our mobile
   product line includes inverters that are either combined with a
   built-in battery source, or are designed to work with an external power
   source such as a car battery or generator. These products and systems,
   which feature intelligent user interface design, are installed in
   boats, recreational vehicles, utility and emergency vehicles,
   heavy-duty trucks, and automobiles. They are also used as standalone
   portable power systems. We also manufacture battery chargers, system
   monitoring devices and other accessories for a variety of applications.
   Xantrex products offer customers the freedom and safety of clean, quiet
   electricity when and where they need it.

Recreational Vehicles

   What do you call a mash-up of a commercial truck, a commercial bus, and
   a hotel room that can offer the most relaxing “hard work” on the open
   road? Well, that would be an RV. What other vehicle allows you to take
   your home away from home and put it wherever the sun sets? Whether you
   prefer the small lightweight popup that your daily driver pulls with
   ease or the gargantuan diesel pusher with granite counter-tops and
   surround sound entertainment - the most important parts are rarely seen
   in normal use.

   If there’s one thing all RVers can agree on, it’s that electrical
   supply should be there when they need it, whether they’re dry camping
   in a national park, sitting in a pedicured campground, or taking a
   quick overnight in the parking lot of a national department store.

   When it comes to electrical power, RVers need reliable devices that
   work easily - exactly when they should. Let’s face it, they’ve got more
   to think about than whether their electrical system is working: like
   taking the perfect panoramic shot, fishing, hiking, or watching the
   game highlights in the parking lot of their favorite sports arena.

   In the RV industry, Xantrex makes the most reliable, cleanest, and
   longest lasting inverters available. Heck, we’ve been doing it for more
   than 30 years. This is what RVers have come to expect. And Xantrex
   delivers.

   Our simple stand-alone inverters, and the Freedom line of
   inverter/chargers have set the bar high for the demanding RV market,
   and we will continue to raise the bar higher with fully featured
   networked systems that anticipate usage and route power to where the
   demand is…automatically. This is smart power, in a mobile package.

   Take the family, point to a spot on a map, and have a great time. While
   we have no control over the weather, we do make components for your
   electrical system. It might rain, but let’s make the best of it…at
   least there’s a game on TV tonight.

   Xantrex provides mobile power solutions for all types and classes of
   both motorized and towable recreational vehicles. Xantrex products
   provide clean, quiet AC power so you don’t have to constantly rely on
   shore power or a noisy generator to enjoy the comforts of home in your
   RV.

   This illustration depicts a sample electrical system for a Class ‘A’
   motorhome where part of the electrical system is powered by a Xantrex
   inverter/charger.

Marine

   Sailboats, cabin cruisers, or Yachts – what do they have in common?
   They all have conveniences of home, on the water. Only around boaters
   does the phrase “I got out of bed this morning and walked out to the
   deck and jumped off for a swim” make sense. Boaters like their fun,
   love their boats, and hate electrical problems.

   Some things on a boat are meant to be tinkered with. Your electrical
   system shouldn’t be one of them. Once it’s installed, the charger,
   inverter, combination inverter/charger, or battery monitor should just
   do what it’s supposed to do,

   Electrical devices have one rule when it comes to boaters: Work!
   Boaters don’t want to troubleshoot a complex electrical system when all
   they’re trying to do is catch fish, catch a breeze, or relax in the
   gentle rocking of the open ocean.

   For boaters, Xantrex is a name synonymous with quality and performance.
   And the brand names “Freedom” and “Link” are often spoken about with
   the same reverence as the big one that got away.

   Our simple stand-alone inverters, TRUEcharge chargers, Link battery
   monitors, and Freedom inverter/chargers have been the part of reliable,
   and high performing electrical systems for decades. With our new lines
   of power factor corrected chargers, and sine wave inverters, we look to
   continue our legacy of quality, high performing electrical components
   for all boats – big or small.

   Cast the line, and relax. Don’t worry about a thing. When it comes to
   your boat’s electrical system…we’ve got you covered.

   Xantrex designs mobile power solutions specifically for the marine
   markets. Our products and solutions are used in both power and sail
   boats. Xantrex products provide clean, quiet AC power so you can enjoy
   the comforts of home on your boat without relying on shore power or a
   noisy generator.

   This illustration depicts a sample electrical system for sailing
   vessels and powerboats with one engine, where the entire AC power
   system is powered by a Xantrex inverter/charger.

Heavy Duty Truck

   VIEW LARGER IMAGE

   Whether just getting on the road again, or six days on the road, a
   truck driver’s day is as long as the long long Texas road. When it’s
   down-time, a driver just wants a hot meal, and a soft pillow. However,
   the electronics in a truck allow some of the creature comforts of home.

   Some of these comforts in a driver’s paradise, like a Microwave, TV, or
   Laptop need AC power. These devices, when used in a truck, need an
   inverter. That’s where we come in.

   When emailing family, checking service records, or just watching your
   favorite show, the last thing a driver wants to concern himself with is
   whether his electrical devices are working or not.

   With inverter models in every major heavy truck OEM, Xantrex is the
   clear choice for the truck driving man. While your truck can’t make the
   call, Xantrex inverters have been truck driver approved since 1995.

   With our strict quality control and HALT testing, Xantrex products have
   the reliability the man behind the wheel needs.

   When you’re done calling Baton Rouge, Giddy up, go, and roll on 18
   wheeler. You’ve got places to go. Your Xantrex inverter will be on that
   happy journey with you.

   The illustration above depicts a Xantrex inverter/charger installed on
   a typical heavy duty truck. The inverter/charger takes stored battery
   power and converts it to AC power to run appliances like TVs and coffee
   makers located in the sleeper cab. Inverting power from a battery bank
   is a quiet and environmentally friendly alternative to idling the
   engine to supply power to the cab.

   When the truck is supplied with external AC power, at a truck stop for
   example, the inverter/charger takes the incoming power and recharges
   the batteries back to full capacity. Excess power is supplied to the
   cab to run appliances.

   If no external AC power is available, the inverter/charger will draw
   12-volt DC power from the battery banks and invert it into 120-volt AC.
   An internal transfer switch senses whether external AC power is
   present, allowing the unit to instantly switch from charge mode to
   invert mode when power is disconnected.

   Xantrex inverters can be installed as an OEM option or as an
   aftermarket installation.
