Kate's In Polka-Dots For Family Nurse Partnership Visit

   An unannounced engagement for the Duchess of Cambridge this morning in
   Camberwell, South London, as she paid a visit to Sunshine House
   Children and Young People‚Äôs Health and Development Centre to meet with
   the Southwark Family Nurse Partnership team.
   [isept9.jpg]
   Kensington Palace said the appearance was organised to "highlight the
   valuable work" that Family Nurse Partnership do and to further Kate's
   research and engagement with the Early Years sector. They added: "FNP
   in Southwark is delivered by Evelina London, of which Her Royal
   Highness is Patron. As part of Guy‚Äôs and St Thomas‚Äô NHS Foundation
   Trust, Evelina London is a major children‚Äôs hospital and provider of
   community services. From health visitors and school nurses to
   specialist treatment for children with long-term health conditions,
   Evelina London‚Äôs community services care for children and families
   across the boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark." The Queen passed her
   patronage of Evelina London to Kate last December.
   [isept8.jpg]
   Following Kate's arrival, there was a very sweet moment when
   four-year-old Oliver presented the Duchess with a posy. Kate thanked
   him and asked him a question, he was feeling very shy and turned around
   toward his mother.
   [elj.jpg]
   Kate caught up with Oliver and his mother Chloe later on during the
   visit.
   [edgnn.jpg]
   Family Nurse Partnership is a voluntary home visiting programme for
   first-time young mums and families. It aims to ensure young women have
   a healthy pregnancy, reach their personal goals and helps to improve
   their child's health and development.
   [evldd.jpg]
   FPN is underpinned by an internationally recognised evidence base which
   shows the initiative improves outcomes both in the short and long term.
   Parents are partnered with a trained family nurse who visits them
   regularly until their child reaches two.
   [isept11.jpg]
   Kate enjoyed chatting with Amina and her little one Ramira.
   [sns3.jpg]
   More from Evelina London:

     'Amina Deen, 23, from Elephant and Castle in south east London,
     spoke to The Duchess about the care she received. She was supported
     by the FNP team during the first two years of her three-year-old
     daughter Ramira‚Äôs life.

     Amina said: ‚ÄúThe Duchess was lovely and down to earth. She was very
     interested in Ramira and asked lots of questions about the support I
     received from the Evelina London FNP team and seemed very impressed
     by the service.

     ‚ÄúWhen I was pregnant with Ramira, my nurse Debbie helped me find
     suitable housing.  When Ramira was born she would regularly visit us
     and we attended classes together at my local children‚Äôs centre.
     Debbie has constantly been there for Ramira and me. I feel very
     thankful for the support I‚Äôve received from the Evelina London FNP
     team. It‚Äôs given me the confidence and knowledge to be an even
     better parent.‚Äù

   It's been twelve years since FNP commenced their work in England. In
   2017, they marked their tenth anniversary and a number of milestones
   including: The 1,000,000th FNP visit, The 30,000th FNP baby born, The
   950th Family Nurse trained and the 200th supervisor trained.
   [fpn11.jpg]
   More on the teams from FNP:

     'Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) is delivered in around 80 areas
     across England. Each local team is made up of specially trained
     family nurse supervisors, family nurses, and quality support
     officers.

     Family nurse supervisors are experienced and highly skilled health
     professionals who also receive extensive additional training from
     the FNP National Unit. They lead the local team: providing
     supervision to their nurses, incorporating formative, restorative
     and normative elements, ensuring safeguarding of clients and their
     children; developing the learning of the nurses in their team; and
     engage and build positive relationships with a wide range of
     stakeholders. Importantly, they also carry a small caseload of
     clients.

     Like supervisors, family nurses are experienced, qualified nurses
     who undergo extensive additional training. Family nurses visit their
     clients at home, following the FNP visit guidelines and using the
     programme theories, their learning, professional knowledge and
     judgment to individualise them to the strengths and challenges of
     each family, apportioning time across defined programme domains.
     They carry a maximum caseload of 25 clients.

     Quality support officers are responsible for a wide range of
     administrative and data management functions. They work with the
     supervisor to ensure all client data it is up to date, and that
     relevant reports are compiled on time. Quality support officers also
     create and manage resources and work directly with a range of FNP
     stakeholders.'

   Rebecca English reports Kate talked about how quickly children grow up
   and said she can't believe George is six already.

   The Duchess met mothers who have completed the programme and discussed
   how the additional support helped them and their children.
   [sns2.jpg]
   Kate heard about the strategic direction and development of the FNP
   programme in England from Ailsa Swarbrick, Director of the FNP National
   Unit.
   [sns1.jpg]
   Jane Powell, Evelina London Director of Nursing said:

     ‚ÄúIt was fantastic to welcome our Patron, The Duchess of Cambridge,
     back to Evelina London to meet our Family Nurse Partnership team.
     They do a truly fantastic job supporting young parents to provide
     the very best care possible to their children.

     ‚ÄúWe are at the heart of our local communities in Lambeth and
     Southwark, giving children the very best start in life. We care for
     children, young people and their families at home and close to home,
     in clinics, health centres, schools and nurseries.

     ‚ÄúThis year is extra special for us as we have been celebrating our
     150th anniversary. Our birthday wish is to be there for even more
     children and young people who need us.‚Äù

   A nice roundup video with great footage of Kate meeting Oliver.

   The Duchess opted for a stylish professional look today - choosing a
   chic polka dot blouse and high-waisted cropped black trousers.
   [duchess%2Bof%2Bcambridge%2Bequipment%2Bpolka%2Bdot%2Bblouse.jpg]
   Caroline Parr swiftly identified Kate's blouse as the Equipment Slim
   Signature Polka-Dot Shirt. The ¬£270 piece is described as: "Cut from
   lightweight washed-silk, it has a slightly loose fit and curved hem
   that looks especially cool styled half-tucked."
   [kate%2Bequipment%2Bshirt.jpg]
   The midnight blue and white washed-silk piece is available at
   Equipment, ShopBop and Nordstrom.
   [ngp11.jpg]
   Caroline also suggests Kate wore the ¬£29.99 ZARA Culottes. The high
   waisted, wide-leg pair with size zip fastening appear to be a match.
   [zara%2Bculottes.jpg]
   Kate wore her trusty Gianvito Rossi Piper block heel shoes.

   Tuesday for her visit to RHS Wisley.
   [kate%2Bgold%2Bearrings.jpg]
   It's been widely suggested they are a sold out ¬£5 Accessorize pair.
   They are incredibly similar, however Susan from What Kate Wore
   correctly noted subtle differences in the metalwork and spotted more
   intricate wirework in Kate's pair in her post last week.

   If you were tuning into Blue Peter today, you might have seen a
   familiar Duchess... Footage from Kate's visit to RHS Wisley last week
   featured with an update on the competition Kate launched on the show in
   June to encourage children to get involved in Back To Nature by
   designing a sculpture to feature in the permanent garden.

   The winning submission is a beautiful butterfly sculpture designed by
   Jessica. It's made of wood and recycled metal and covered in clematis

   In other news, Kensington Palace announced an engagement for William
   and Kate next Thursday:

     'The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit Birkenhead on Thursday
     26th September to attend the naming ceremony of the UK‚Äôs new polar
     research ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough. Before the ceremony,
     Their Royal Highnesses will undertake a short tour of the ship.

     Owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and
     operated by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), the RRS Sir David
     Attenborough will enable world-leading research to be carried out in
     Antarctica and the Arctic over the next 25 to 30 years. Studying
     these remote regions plays a crucial role in allowing us to
     understand the changes in our planet‚Äôs oceans, marine life and
     climate systems. The ship will be available year-round to the UK‚Äôs
     research community.'

   The Court Circular notes Kate attended two Royal Foundation meetings
   over the past week and both William and Kate met with Love Actually
   director Richard Curtis separately last week. There's whispers we might
   see them team up for a mental health initiative. A royal source told
   People they "discussed their shared interest in mental wellbeing and
   supporting families".

"It Takes A Village To Raise A Child": The Duchess Marks The Culmination Of
Back To Nature

   The Duchess of Cambridge began her September schedule today with a
   previously unannounced visit to RHS Wisley for the fun-filled Back To
   Nature festival.
   [jsept7.jpg]
   It marks Kate's official return to duties following summer break. The
   engagement was the culmination of Kate's garden project which aimed to
   highlight the importance of children spending as much time as possible
   outdoors enjoying nature.
   [jsept5%2Bkate%2Bwisley.jpg]
   Kensington Palace said: "As part of her longstanding work on Early
   Years, the Duchess of Cambridge believes that spending time outdoors
   plays a pivotal role in children‚Äôs future health and happiness,
   building foundations that last through childhood and over a lifetime.
   Through her Back to Nature gardens, which were displayed earlier this
   year at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show and Hampton Court Palace Garden
   Festival, Her Royal Highness has aimed to highlight how spending time
   outdoors can enrich a child‚Äôs early development by providing an
   environment that encourages active exploration and the opportunity to
   form and strengthen positive relationships."
   [jsept4%2Bkate%2Brhs%2Bwisley.jpg]
   The Duchess officially opened a new play garden at Wisley, which was
   inspired by Back To Nature. Designed by landscape architects Davies
   White with support from RHS horticultural teams, it includes a number
   of features from the original garden at RHS Chelsea such as the hollow
   log and boulders from the waterfall and the hidden burrow and rolling
   hill from Hampton Court Garden.
   [jsept2.jpg]
   New features include a bouncing forest where visitors can jump on
   trampolines, a living willow pod and two linked treehouses.
   [shr5.jpg]
   It's a permanent installation which children will enjoy for many years
   to come.
   [shr6.jpg]
   The Duchess enjoyed a chat with the Queen of Baking and RHS Wisley
   patron Mary Berry.
   [jsept3%2Bkate%2Band%2Bmary%2Bberry.jpg]
   Kate has met Mary on a number of occasions over the years. She was once
   revealed she is "a big fan of her cookbooks and cakes".
   [SHR3.jpg]
   To celebrate the Back To Nature festival will run throughout this week
   at Wisley.
   [rw31.jpg]
   It includes circus acts, maypole dancing, a coconut shy and a host of
   gardening activities.
   [sh6.jpg]
   Sue Biggs, RHS Director General, said: ‚ÄúWe are grateful to The Duchess
   for the incredible impact that this ‚ÄòBack to Nature‚Äô collaboration has
   had. There is no doubt that this project, through her passion and
   vision, has highlighted that access to natural environments and green
   spaces isn‚Äôt just a nice to have, it‚Äôs vital to have. This is something
   that the RHS also strongly believes in and will continue to champion
   through our Greening Great Britain Campaign and charitable work.‚Äù
   [kzs33.jpg]
   A number of representatives, families and children from charities and
   organisations Kate has met over the course of her early years work were
   invited today.
   [zdk1.jpg]
   Hannah Furness reports: "The Duchess was equally impressed by
   three-year-old Dylan Corbin from Woking, Surrey, who was dressed as an
   animal. ‚ÄúAre you a tiger?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúNo," he said. "It‚Äôs face paint."
   [SHR2.jpg]
   Kate was particularly taken by fifteen-month-old Matilda Griffiths. She
   chatted with mum Sarah about Louis and said "he loves to smell flowers"
   and spend time in the garden.
   [jsept6.jpg]
   More from The Telegraph:

     "Sarah Griffiths, 25, from Southend, Essex, who has been helped by
     the charity Family Action and brought her 15-month-old daughter
     Matilda with her, said: ‚ÄúThe experience was a bit overwhelming, it‚Äôs
     still a bit of a daze, but really exciting. ‚ÄúShe asked me how Family
     Action have helped me. They‚Äôve helped me lots getting me out
     socialising.‚Äù

   A very sweet video of Kate dancing with Matilda.

     ‚Äî Women's Weekly (@WomensWeeklyMag) September 10, 2019

   The group travelled via tractor and trailer before Kate's speech.
   [shr1.jpg]
   During a very nicely delivered speech, Kate spoke of the importance of
   laying the foundation blocks from the earliest years, her work in the
   area and how much she has enjoyed the process of creating the garden.
   "There is a well-known proverb ‚Äì that it takes a village to raise a
   child ‚Äì everyone here represents an integral part of that very village.
   By coming together, having fun, learning and experiencing new things,
   we can all impart life-long benefits on our children."

   them. pic.twitter.com/Nd9ek3rxkl

     ‚Äî Emily Andrews (@byEmilyAndrews) September 10, 2019

   Kate's full speech from The Mail:

     'As many of you know, I was invited by the RHS to co-design a garden
     for families and children for this year‚Äôs Chelsea Flower Show and
     Hampton Court Palace Garden Festival. It‚Äôs been the most amazing
     experience and I can‚Äôt thank the RHS enough for giving me this
     wonderful opportunity.

     'I am delighted that many of those features that first appeared in
     those gardens, have found a permanent home here at Wisley in the new
     children‚Äôs play garden. I hope it will enable thousands of children
     to discover and explore the natural world around them.

     'I am not as green fingered as many of you here, but I was
     passionate about creating a garden that inspired children and adults
     alike to get back to nature and reap the positive mental and
     physical health benefits that it can bring. The gardens were, I
     suppose, a manifestation of some of the work I have been focusing on
     around how best we can support our children in the earliest years.

     'The physical benefits of being outdoors and in nature are well
     documented. More recently, however, I have learnt that these often
     safe and supportive environments can also bring significant benefits
     to the cognitive, social and emotional development of our children
     too.

     'The experiences we gain during our earliest years influence who we
     become as people. They influence how we interact in school, in work
     and in society and, ultimately how we bring up our own children.

     'Whether it is planting, exploring, digging, creating, or playing;
     quality time spent outside provides children with the perfect
     environment to form those positive relationships with the people in
     their lives and the world around them. As a parent, I have learnt
     just how important it is to foster our children‚Äôs development, in
     all areas, not just physical, as soon as they are born.

     'We build the blocks, the foundations, for future success and
     happiness later in their lives. These relationships, however,
     stretch far beyond the crucial one that a parent or carer has with
     its child.  Like in the animal kingdom, whether a pod, a pack, or a
     pride, the interactions we have with the broader community ‚Äì be it
     with our grandparent, teachers or neighbours ‚Äì play a crucial role
     in the growth and learning of our young.

     'There is a well-known proverb ‚Äì that it takes a village to raise a
     child ‚Äì everyone here represents an integral part of that very
     village. By coming together, having fun, learning and experiencing
     new things, we can all impart life-long benefits on our children.

     'That is why I wanted to invite you here today ‚Äì many of whom I have
     met in my pursuit to learn more about the early years - to celebrate
     the work that you are doing, thank you personally and to continue
     working with you to inspire even more people to follow your lead. I
     hope you all have a wonderful day.'

   Time for arts and crafts.
   [shr4.jpg]
   The Duchess continued her trend of wearing floral dresses for her
   garden visits by choosing the Emilia Wickstead Aurora dress (with
   thanks to Middleton Maven).
   [knb3.jpg]
   The $2,255 piece is described as: "This 'Aurora' shirt dress is made
   from light and breathable seersucker and decorated with her signature
   'Rosewood' florals. Use the buckled belt to define your waist." It's
   available in limited sizing at Net-A-Porter.
   [wickstead%2Baurora.jpg]
   Kate wore her Monsoon Fleur wedges.
   [monsoon%2Bfleur%2Bwedges.jpg]
   A closer look at Kate's new earrings. They were initially identified as
   an Accessorize pair, however the eagle-eyed What Kate Wore correctly
   noted several differences. I'll update when/if they are definitively
   ID'd.
   [zvb2.jpg]
   The Back To Nature garden is a lovely addition to Wisley. It was
   terrific to see so many children from various charities supported by
   the Duchess having fun and exploring with their loved ones - exactly
   what the project was all about.
