      disabilities of patients suffering from injuries or disease. They
      restore, maintain, and promote overall fitness and health. Their

                           What is Physiotherapy ?

      Physical therapy or physiotherapy is the provision of services to
       people and populations to develop, maintain and restore maximum
    movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. It includes
   the provision of services in circumstances where movement and function
    are threatened by the process of aging or that of injury or disease.
   The method of physical therapy sees full and functional movement as at
                  the heart of what it means to be healthy.

   Physical therapy is concerned with identifying and maximizing movement
    potential, within the spheres of promotion, prevention, treatment and
    rehabilitation. It involves the interaction between physical clients,
   families and care givers, in a process of assessing movement potential
    and in establishing agreed upon goals and objectives using knowledge
                  and skills unique to physical therapists.

   The physical therapists’ distinctive view of the body and its movement
      needs and potential is central to determining a diagnosis and an
    intervention strategy and is consistent whatever the setting in which
   practice is undertaken. These settings will vary in relation to whether
      physical therapy is concerned with health promotion, prevention,
                         treatment or rehabilitation
