                         Is Lab-Grown Meat Good for Us?

   No saturated fat, no heme iron, no growth hormone—cultured meat seems
   to have many potential benefits.


    Marta Zaraska

   Aug 19, 2013

   Conventional meat (the kind that grows inside animals, not petri
   dishes) is, in several ways, not exactly good for our health. Research
   shows that regularly indulging can lead to higher risk of heart
   disease, diabetes, and some kinds of cancer.

   Professor Mark Post of the University of Maastricht, the scientist
   behind the first in-vitro burger, believes that test tube meat will be
   better for us. “We gain greater control over what the meat consists of,
   for example its fat content,” he says. “And the reduction in the number
   of farmed animals reduces the chance of zoonosis,“ or infectious
   diseases that spread from animals to people. So how exactly could meat
   grown in labs be better for our health than the meat that is grown in
   cows or pigs?

   According to Joan Salge Blake, spokesperson for the Academy of
   Nutrition and Dietetics, one of the key factors is saturated fat. “If
   they are going to make their own fats, they will be able to replace the
   saturated fatty acids with, for example, omega-3 fatty acids,” she
   said.

   While saturated fatty acids are known to contribute to cardiovascular
   disease and type 2 diabetes, omega-3s (found naturally in fish or
   flaxseed oil) are a healthier option—they reduce inflammation and may
   help lower risk of heart disease and arthritis. If Post is right, and
   in 10 to 20 years we have lab-grown burgers and sausages on the shelves
   of our supermarkets, they may well come in “no cholesterol” and “no
   saturated fats” varieties.

   They might come in “no heme iron” versions, too. Post’s burger was most
   likely heme-iron free. In the future, he says, “it is conceivable that
   we will try and make reduced heme-iron containing meat.”

   Conventional wisdom says that heme iron, the type of iron found only in
   meat and fish, is actually good for us. After all, it’s much better
   absorbed by the body than the iron found commonly in plants (called
   non-heme iron), and, as such, more likely to keep anemia at bay. Yet
   recent studies show that there is also a darker side to heme iron. If
   consumed, it may raise the risk of heart disease and some cancers. It
   has also been linked to type 2 diabetes.

   “Both the iron and the fat content of the meat are likely relevant
   risks for this disease,” says Desley White, lecturer in dietetics at
   Plymouth University, and the author of a study on dietary heme iron
   which appeared in the July issue of Advances in Nutrition. She points
   out, though, that heme iron is only partly to blame for type 2
   diabetes. “If you ate only cultured meat, heme iron-free, yet kept the
   same [amount] of activity, and stayed overweight, I doubt you would
   avoid diabetes, though you might delay it for some time. But if eating
   fat-free cultured meat would also mean a drop in calorie intake, then
   there would be an added decrease in diabetes risk,” she says.

   It is also possible that the cultured meats of the future may not
   contain L-carnitine, a substance found naturally in red meat (but also
   present in much smaller amounts in fish, poultry, asparagus and
   avocados) —and that is likely good news, too. A study published in
   April in Nature Medicine showed that L-carnitine gets broken down by
   bacteria in the gut, and that a chemical resulting from this process
   ups the risk of heart disease.

   If in vitro meats were produced using current technology, they could
   lack nutrients that are essential for good health. Post’s beef patty
   (which was really just a proof of concept), consisted only of muscle
   fibers. There was no fat in it, no blood or blood vessels, no
   connective tissues. This, according to Post, means that the range of
   nutrients in cultured beef would be different than in conventional
   meat. But he and his colleagues are working to change that. “Once all
   of these other components are included in cultured meat there is no
   reason for it to be less healthy than conventional meat,” he says.

   Physician Neal Barnard, the author of several studies on red meat’s
   impact on health, believes that just like we now have orange juice
   fortified with Vitamin D, in the future we could heave cultured steaks
   or bacon fortified with Vitamin B12 (which we need to keep our nerve
   and blood cells healthy). “We have not looked into it yet, but it’s
   possible,” Post said.

   Yet the story of healthy (or unhealthy) meats is not just a story of
   nutrients, of fats and of cholesterol. This story begins on farms.
   Nowadays, most animals raised for meat are raised in CAFOs—confined
   animal feeding operations. CAFOs not only lead to animal suffering, but
   also dirt, drugs, and disease. Workers employed in CAFOs may suffer
   from asthma, eye inflammation, and chronic bronchitis. That, obviously,
   would not be an issue for technicians growing meat in sterile labs.

   What’s more, pollution from factory farms is a health hazard for
   surrounding communities. A study conducted in North Carolina found that
   people who live near hog farms have more headaches, runny noses,
   diarrhea, and burning eyes than those who live in cleaner
   neighborhoods. CAFOs also risk contaminating drinking water with
   nitrates from the animals’ waste. If ingested, nitrates may cause
   miscarriages, certain types of cancers, congenital malformations, and a
   “blue baby syndrome”—a condition which can cause comas in infants.

   Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment of
   Animals, points out that replacing CAFOs with labs will mean replacing
   dirt with sterility. “There will be health benefits for us, because
   this meat will be clean,” she says. According to the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention, meat and poultry are the most common
   food sources of fatal infections, responsible for 29 percent of
   food-poisoning related deaths in the U.S., largely due to Salmonella
   and Listeria infections. Salmonella are bacteria that live in the
   intestinal tracts of animals such as cattle or poultry. When the
   animals are stressed (which happens often in CAFOs and
   slaughterhouses), they shed large amounts of this bacteria into their
   feces, which can contaminate the meat. Later, if it’s undercooked or
   badly handled, this can mean food poisoning. In recent months 134
   people in 13 states were infected with a strain of Salmonella from
   chicken meat.

   Eating conventional meat can also lead to listeria, E. coli or
   Campylobacter infections. It can mean toxoplasmosis (dangerous for
   pregnant women) or, in rare cases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. That
   doesn’t mean that lab-grown meat would be 100 percent safe, just much
   safer. Professor Amee Manges of the University of British Columbia, who
   has published studies on food-borne pathogens, points out that cultured
   meat could still get infected with bacteria during processing.

   Cultured meat—at least produced the way Post does it—would also mean no
   growth hormones (banned in the European Union, but still approved for
   use in Canada and the U.S.), which according to the EU’s Scientific
   Committee for Veterinary Measures, can have “developmental,
   neurobiological, and carcinogenic effects.” Lab grown meat would not
   contain residues of pesticides (applied to the animals to control
   insects), no tranquillizers, no de-wormers.

   For now, though, lab-grown meats still require the use of antibiotics.
   In conventional meat production antibiotics are given routinely to
   healthy animals to promote growth. They are used so freely, that
   according to the Food and Drug Administration, they now constitute 72
   percent of all U.S. antibiotic sales. This, in turn, can lead to the
   emergence of resistant bacteria. Post’s lab-grown beef required
   antibiotics, too. “Cultured muscle has no immune system, so it was
   necessary. In the future, once production is scaled up and automated,
   it could be done in closed sterile systems so the antibiotics will no
   longer be needed,” he says.

   With meat grown in sterile labs, we could also worry less about
   emerging diseases, such as avian flu and swine flu, which are
   associated with intensive farming. And if scientists could produce
   exotic meats like chimpanzee in their petri dishes, there would be less
   risk of retroviruses and herpes being imported with bushmeat into the
   U.S. from Africa. Right now, 180,000 pounds of bushmeat enters our
   country illegally each year. According to Post, growing exotic meats in
   a lab wouldn’t be much more difficult than growing beef or chicken.

   Yet there remains the problem of the “yuck factor” of what many already
   call “frankenmeat.” Some worry that we don’t know what eating stem
   cells may mean for our health down the road. Peter Verstrate, a food
   technician who worked with Post on the development of the cultured
   beef, reassures: “Stem cells are everywhere. In your muscle tissue
   there are stem cells, too. The only thing we do is take them out and
   tell them to multiply and to become muscle tissue. Just like they do in
   your arm or in your leg when you have a wound, to repair the muscle.”

           Rising Instagram Stars Are Posting Fake Sponsored Content

   “It’s street cred—the more sponsors you have, the more credibility you
   have.”


    Taylor Lorenz

   Dec 18, 2018

   Shutterstock

   Tapping through Palak Joshi’s Instagram Stories recently, you might
   have come across a photo that looked like standard sponsored content: a
   shiny white box emblazoned with the red logo for the Chinese phone
   manufacturer OnePlus and the number six, shot from above on a concrete
   background. It featured the branded hashtag tied to the phone’s launch,
   and tagged OnePlus’s Instagram handle. And it looked similar to posts
   from the company itself announcing the launch of its new Android phone.
   Joshi’s post, however, wasn’t an ad. “It looked sponsored, but it’s
   not,” she said. Her followers are none the wiser. “They just assume
   everything is sponsored when it really isn’t,” she said. And she wants
   it that way.

   A decade ago, shilling products to your fans may have been seen as
   selling out. Now it’s a sign of success. “People know how much
   influencers charge now, and that payday is nothing to shake a stick
   at,” said Alyssa Vingan Klein, the editor in chief of Fashionista, a
   fashion-news website. “If someone who is 20 years old watching YouTube
   or Instagram sees these people traveling with brands, promoting brands,
   I don’t see why they wouldn’t do everything they could to get in on
   that.”

   But transitioning from an average Instagram or YouTube user to a
   professional “influencer”—that is, someone who leverages a social-media
   following to influence others and make money—is not easy. After
   archiving old photos, redefining your aesthetic, and growing your
   follower base to at least the quadruple digits, you’ll want to approach
   brands. But the hardest deal to land is your first, several influencers
   say; companies want to see your promotional abilities and past campaign
   work. So many have adopted a new strategy: Fake it until you make it.

   Sydney Pugh, a lifestyle influencer in Los Angeles, recently staged a
   fake ad for a local cafe, purchasing her own mug of coffee,
   photographing it, and adding a promotional caption carefully written in
   that particular style of ad speak anyone who spends a lot of time on
   Instagram will recognize. “Instead of [captioning] ‘I need coffee to
   get through the day,’ mine will say ‘I love Alfred’s coffee because of
   A, B, C,’” Pugh told me. “You see the same things over and over on
   actual sponsored posts, so it becomes really easy to emulate, even if
   you’re not getting paid.”

   When a local amusement park paid several bloggers to attend the venue
   and post about their experience there, Joshi, a fashion and lifestyle
   influencer, went on her own dime and posted promotional posts as if she
   were part of the bigger influencer campaign.

   Taylor Evans took the fake-“sponcon” game one step further, once faking
   the entire purpose of a trip to Miami. Technically, she was just there
   on vacation, paying her own way for everything, but on Instagram she
   positioned it as an exclusive press trip. “I took a lot of pics at
   restaurants and posted ‘Thanks so much XYZ restaurant for the
   hospitality!’” she said. “You say it in a way that people could
   interpret it as you having an established relationship with that brand
   … The hope is that it’s perceived in a way that looks like there’s a
   reason you’re in a different city and state, not just enjoying a
   weekend vacation.”

     posts. welcome 2 the Internet
     — Justine Dorsey (@justinedorsey) January 23, 2017

   Jason Wong, the founder of the false-eyelash company Doux Lashes, said
   he’s surprised at the levels to which aspiring influencers have gone to
   promote his brand for free. “Normally influencers did one post for one
   product,” he said. Now “we’ve seen influencers do two to three posts
   for one product. They want to have a continuous stream of content to
   make it seem like it’s sponsored.”

   Monica Ahanonu, an illustrator and Instagram influencer with nearly
   12,000 followers, said that fake ads have become so common that she’s
   not even sure who is sponsored and who is pretending. While the Federal
   Trade Commission recently ruled that paid advertisements must be
   disclosed, influencers regularly flout those guidelines. And there are
   no rules against people who aren’t paid captioning their photos to make
   them sound like paid disclosures. Ahanonu herself posted an Instagram
   recently featuring custom artwork promoting a Chanel cosmetics kit. She
   didn’t receive payment or any product in exchange, but her post would
   look right at home among other Chanel ads.

   For the average consumer, things become blurry quickly. Many fashion
   influencers tag the brands they’re using in photos, whether the clothes
   were purchased, given to them for free, or are part of an ad campaign.
   Lifestyle blogging is all about seamlessly monetizing your good taste
   and consumer choices, which means it can be near-impossible for
   laypeople to tell if an influencer genuinely loves a product, is being
   paid to talk about it, or just wants to be paid to talk about it.

   When Allie, a 15-year-old lifestyle influencer who asked to be referred
   to by a pseudonym, scrolls through her Instagram feed, sometimes the
   whole thing seems like an ad. There’s a fellow teen beauty influencer
   bragging about her sponsorship with Maybelline, a high-school sophomore
   she knows touting his brand campaign with Voss water. None of these
   promotions, however, is real. Allie is friends with the people posting,
   so she knows. She once faked a water sponsorship herself. “People
   pretend to have brand deals to seem cool,” Allie said. “It’s a thing,
   like, I got this for free while all you losers are paying.”

   “In the influencer world, it’s street cred,” said Brian Phanthao, a
   19-year-old lifestyle influencer in San Diego who sees fake ads all
   over Instagram. “The more sponsors you have, the more credibility you
   have.”

   Phanthao said most of the people he sees doing it grew up watching
   influencers and now aspire to their lifestyle. “It’s really common with
   kids in high school,” he said. “They’re very influenced by
   influencers.” At first he was astounded that brands he recognized would
   partner with some of the people he saw on his feed. But when he
   cross-checked the brands’ websites, he couldn’t find their names.

     this girl I know really had a sponcon themed bday party. wow what an
     example of fake it til u make it.
     — Jessica Jacolbe (@jessjoycej) April 30, 2018

   Henry, a 15-year-old beauty influencer who asked to be referred to by
   his first name only, said he doesn’t post fake ads himself, but said he
   noticed his social status rise as he got more attention online this
   year. “People come up to me at school like, ‘Do you get sponsored?’” he
   said. “When I say I do they’re like, ‘OMG that’s so cool.’ I noticed
   the more followers I gain, the more people in the hall come up and talk
   to me.”

   Read: Posting Instagram sponsored content is the new summer job

   But of course, clout is just a means to an end, and ultimately, most of
   the people posting fake ads hope to eventually get paid to post real
   ones. Evans said staging these fake promotions “makes you seem like
   you’re in a position to be getting things for free, which helps you
   build your brand or media kit … It makes you seem more established,
   like you have brands that you’re working with. That means you’re
   producing good content and you’re worthy of approaching and offering
   these opportunities to.”

   After Samantha Leibowitz-Bienstock, a lifestyle influencer who posts
   under the name Trendy Ambitious Blonde, posted a photo of herself with
   a Betsey Johnson bag she purchased with her own money and tagged the
   company, she was featured on its website. She wasn’t paid, but she
   considered it a win for her personal brand.

   But while some companies are thrilled with the free promotion, for
   others it’s become a headache. The owner of one sunglasses brand, who
   asked to remain anonymous so as not to alienate anyone in the
   influencer community, said the practice has put him in a tough position
   as a stream of mid-level influencers post mediocre-quality sponsored
   content seemingly on his behalf, without his approval or control.

   He has seen influencers thanking his brand for “working with” them when
   he knew they had never partnered. “We do encourage our fans to put our
   stuff on Instagram. That’s how we grow,” he said. But he added that he
   was worried that some people appearing to be brand ambassadors could
   ultimately damage his business’s reputation. Though he has considered
   it, he has never reached out to any of the influencers and asked them
   to take their post down. To him, that feels like even more of a risk.
   “These people are looking for the most amount of attention, so if they
   want to make it seem like they’ve been wronged in any way by a brand,
   they will,” he said.

   And then there’s the fact that fake sponcon misleads would-be partners.
   Wong was once a Tumblr star himself, and he knows the ins and outs of
   online marketing. But even he was recently duped. After hiring one
   influencer to promote his product, he later found out that all of her
   brand deals were fake. Now he cross-references all potential partners,
   calling up other brands they’ve claimed to work with to see if that
   work was paid.

     If I see any more “self made entrepreneurs” flexing their rented
     Lamborghinis and fake Rollies in sponsored posts on Instagram I am
     ending it all
     — Sinferna (@withthedraco) October 4, 2018

   Though it may seem like a useful tactic when you’re starting out, more
   established influencers worry that fake sponcon is creating a race to
   the bottom. Because brands can piggyback off of waves of unpaid
   influencer promoters, some have ceased paying influencers completely,
   or now pay rates far below what they previously spent.

   “I don’t think people know they’re screwing each other over,” said CJ
   OperAmericano, a 22-year-old TikTok star. She has watched rates plummet
   as the industry becomes more saturated, and she recently lost out on a
   brand campaign to someone who offered to do it for a tenth of the
   price. People now treat brand deals “like a verification badge,” she
   said.

   Vingan Klein said she can’t blame the young fashion influencers she
   sees coming up today for their hustle. “Trying to get sponsored is your
   way out of this rat race,” she said. Teens today realize that “you
   don’t have to go up this hierarchy; you can skip the middleman,” she
   added. “Besides, what do the followers know?”

        China Is Going to Outrageous Lengths to Surveil Its Own Citizens

   New tech—including drones disguised as birds—can be a nightmare for
   Muslims in particular.

   China has reportedly begun deploying flocks of drones disguised as
   birds to surveil its citizens. The drones have wings that flap so
   realistically they’re difficult to distinguish from actual birds. In
   fact, animals on the ground often can’t make the distinction, and even
   real birds in the sky sometimes fly alongside the drones. One
   researcher involved in the project has claimed that the robotic birds
   can mimic 90 percent of the movements of their biological counterparts,
   and they’re also very quiet, which helps them avoid detection.

   The operation’s codename is “Dove”—but there’s reason to doubt whether
   these machines come in peace. Yang Wenqing, a member of the team behind
   Dove, said the technology has “some unique advantages to meet the
   demand for drones in the military and civilian sectors” and “good
   potential for large-scale use in the future.”

   Headlines about technologies like these gaining traction in China have
   been appearing in the news with alarming frequency. Facial-recognition
   tech is now used for everything from catching criminals in huge crowds
   to detecting and shaming jaywalkers to deciding whether someone can get
   an extra square of toilet paper in a public bathroom. Some employees
   have to wear helmets that scan their brainwaves for rage, depression,
   anxiety, or fatigue, and that alert their bosses to any perceived
   problem. Then there’s the country’s social credit system, which
   monitors millions of individuals’ behavior (including via social media
   and online shopping), determines how moral or immoral it is, and raises
   or lowers their “citizen score” accordingly. Those with a high score
   are rewarded, while those with a low score are punished.

   Even in a country known for its extreme spying on its entire
   population, the degree of surveillance targeting Muslims in particular
   is unnerving. An estimated 22 to 25 million Muslims live in China, out
   of a total population of 1.4 billion. Last year, a Freedom House study
   found that extensive surveillance affects many religious groups, with
   Muslims as well as Protestant Christians and Tibetan Buddhists
   experiencing an increase in persecution over the previous five years.
   In an interview this week, Timothy Grose, a China expert at the Rose
   Hulman Institute of Technology, told me, “Right now, we see a lot of
   the repression being directed against Muslims.”

   Chinese tech isn’t the enemy

   The Dove program’s bird-like drones have been flown over five provinces
   so far, and it’s perhaps no coincidence that they’ve been used
   extensively in one area in particular: Xinjiang, a northwestern region
   heavily populated by Uighurs, a largely Muslim ethnic minority. The
   government has long considered the region a breeding ground for
   separatism and extremism. Ethnic riots there killed hundreds in 2009,
   and some Uighurs have perpetrated terror attacks in recent years. The
   area is now subject to a heightened level of surveillance, with
   authorities collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, voice
   samples, and blood types from residents.

   “They’re applying a very, very broad attempted solution to what they
   see as an ideological danger. In Xinjiang, the definition of extremism
   has expanded so far as to incorporate virtually anything you do as a
   Muslim,” James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown
   University, told me. The amount of surveillance directed at that
   region’s 11 million Uighurs, he added, is “certainly disproportionate”
   relative to that directed at other groups. “Islam is now effectively
   being demonized in China.”

   This month, 11,500 Chinese Muslims are heading to Mecca on the annual
   Hajj pilgrimage. Before leaving the country, some of the pilgrims were
   given state-issued tracking devices, in the form of “smart cards”
   attached to lanyards around their necks. The devices bear GPS trackers
   and customized personal data. The state-run China Islamic Association
   says they’re intended to ensure the pilgrims’ safety. (There is
   legitimate reason for such concerns: During the 2015 Hajj, a stampede
   killed more than 750 pilgrims.) But some human-rights experts say this
   is one more effort to surveil Muslims. The government’s fear, according
   to a Human Rights Watch report, is that religious pilgrimages could act
   as “potential cover for subversive political activity.”

   “I don’t use what comes out of human-rights organizations uncritically,
   but here’s one case where I would definitely side with them,” Grose
   said. “The pilgrims are always accompanied by an official guide,
   essentially a monitor, who represents the Chinese Islamic Association,
   which represents the state. Their movements are always under
   supervision. Their schedules are airtight, with very little room for
   any extracurricular activities. So the use of GPS in an already tightly
   put-together schedule just seems too redundant [if it’s about safety].
   To me, it’s about: ‘Well, what if one of them sneaks away, and we need
   to find out where he is and if he’s talking to someone and bringing
   back with him an interpretation of Islam that doesn’t accord with [what
   the government] has been promoting?’”

   China’s new frontiers in dystopian tech

   Muslims are also experiencing larger human-rights violations in China.
   An estimated 1 million Uighurs are reportedly being held without trial
   in detention camps, where they’re forced to memorize Communist Party
   propaganda, criticize their own previous religious behavior, and
   renounce Islam, including by eating pork and drinking alcohol. China
   issued a denial Monday after a United Nations human-rights panel said
   last Friday that it’s seen many credible reports alleging that a
   million Uighurs are held in what resembles a “massive internment camp
   that is shrouded in secrecy.” In July, the U.S. State Department
   expressed deep concern about the “possibly millions” of Muslims in the
   camps, and an earlier U.S. commission called it “the largest mass
   incarceration of a minority population in the world today.”

   Although China has been mostly targeting Uighurs, it’s also detaining
   Muslim members of other ethnic groups like Kazakhs. If Uighurs and
   Kazakhs—both Turkic peoples—are taking the brunt of the maltreatment,
   it’s likely because the Chinese authorities see them as a threat to the
   integrity of the country, with Uighur separatists aspiring to their own
   national homeland (they refer to Xinjiang as East Turkestan) and
   Kazakhs maintaining foreign contacts across the border in Kazakhstan.

   “The Chinese government thinks that these Turkic Muslims have incorrect
   thoughts,” Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch,
   wrote in an email, “because they identify more with Turks and Muslims
   in Turkey and Central Asia. To correct these thoughts, and to make them
   loyal subjects of the Chinese Communist Party, it needs to reengineer
   their identities and to tightly control them.”

   For his part, Grose said, “The Chinese Communist Party allows for and
   even celebrates most ethnic diversity. But when that’s animated by
   religious nationalism, that’s what the Party fears—because those are
   forces that originate outside China, which they can’t control.”

   Chinese experiments in surveillance are having an impact elsewhere in
   the world: Some of the new tech the authorities seem to try out on
   Uighur Muslims is later applied more broadly in the country and then
   exported abroad. “Xinjiang provides a testing ground from which they
   can then try it in larger places,” Grose said. Chinese firms have
   already sold their surveillance tech to countries like Malaysia,
   Pakistan, and Zimbabwe, and may soon gain a foothold in Europe, too.

                     TV’s Ad Apocalypse Is Getting Closer

   Disney’s decision to build its own streaming service is smart. It’s
   also the latest sign that the traditional cable bundle is doomed.


    Derek Thompson

   Aug 10, 2017

   Mike Blake / Reuters

   Disney announced on Tuesday that it will stop selling content to
   Netflix by 2019 and will instead launch two streaming services—one with
   sports content from ESPN (which it owns) and another for movies. It is
   a dramatic announcement with far-reaching implications for the future
   of television and, pulling back the lens even farther, the U.S. tech
   and media landscape.

   Before getting to the future, let’s start with the present of
   television. Pay TV—that is, the bundle of channels one can buy from
   Comcast or DirecTV—is in a ratings free fall among all viewers born
   since the Nixon administration. Since 2010, the time that Americans
   under 35 have spent watching television has declined by about 50
   percent, according to Matthew Ball, the head of strategy at Amazon
   Studios.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Matthew Ball
     __________________________________________________________________

   As a result, Disney’s cable-television business, once the crown jewel
   of the company, is now weighing down its stock. Where are its viewers
   going? Many have decamped for streaming services like Netflix, where
   the number of hours of video entertainment consumed has grown by about
   700 percent in the same time.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Kleiner Perkins
     __________________________________________________________________

   This has created a business crisis for entertainment companies like
   Disney. Old Disney’s television strategy was: Focus on making great
   content and then sell it to distribution companies, like Comcast and
   DirecTV. This worked brilliantly when practically the entire country
   subscribed to the same television product. For example, when Disney
   sold its goods to Comcast, it stimulated demand for the cable bundle,
   which meant more people had access to ESPN, which meant ESPN’s
   advertising revenues soared, which meant Disney profited. Thanks to
   virtuous cycle of bundling, separating content and distribution used to
   be the obvious play for Disney.

   But New Disney is looking for a fresh play. Now that young households
   are cutting the cord, it wants to own both content and distribution.
   Netflix once famously said that it wanted to be HBO before HBO could be
   Netflix; that is, to become a great content company before HBO could
   become a technology company. With this week’s announcement, Disney is
   declaring that it wants to rival Netflix, as a streaming competitor,
   before Netflix can rival Disney, as a prodigious content-owner and
   rights-holder.

   This move may be necessary, but it’s awfully risky. Disney is the envy
   of the entertainment industry by virtue of its catalogue, which
   includes Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and a legendary animated-films
   portfolio. Its ability to re-merchandize its most popular content, with
   amusement parks, toys, and sequels, is unparalleled. But it is not a
   technology company. There aren't many great examples of legacy media
   empires successfully transitioning to the digital age without a few
   disasters along the way, or at least a long period of readjustment.
   Just look at American newspapers, or the music labels at the beginning
   of the 2000s.

   This announcement is only days old, but it’s not too early to
   anticipate the furthest-reaching implications of “Disneyflix” on the
   future of media and technology.

   Disney’s streaming products will debut in a crowded marketplace.
   Netflix has 50 million domestic subscribers. Hulu has 12 million. Tens
   of millions more subscribe to Amazon Video, as part of their Prime
   subscriptions. Disneyflix will start from way behind, and it will have
   to offer something compelling—on price, quality, or convenience—to get
   millions of people to pay for yet another TV thing. What might its
   pitch include?

   One seemingly banal prediction would be commercial-free access to its
   incredible catalogue of films. Or, at least, very few commercials for
   non-sports content. (Sports rights are expensive, and live sports often
   has so many breaks that it would be weird if there's weren't commercial
   interstitials. ) This seems like a pretty modest offering. After all,
   Netflix and Amazon already offer an ad-free experience.

   But play this out: Imagine that the Disney bundle is seen as a modest
   success, as is possible given the strength of its current catalogue.
   Other media companies might follow suit, and, before long, there might
   be an NBCUniversal bundle, a 21st Century Fox bundle, and a Time Warner
   bundle. All of these streaming services would be jostling for America’s
   limited entertainment budget and limited TV-viewing time. They would
   all feel the pressure to lure subscribers with the promise of fewer
   ads, or a commercial-free experience.

   Where would this leave U.S. TV advertising, which companies spend $40
   billion a year on? Very endangered. After all, each ad-free streaming
   product is yet another reason to dump the ad-rich cable bundle.

   “All right,” one might think. “So more and more Americans will see
   fewer and fewer commercials. This is a really boring hypothetical.”

   Except that $40 billion of advertising won’t just disappear. Ad dollars
   never do. The share of U.S. GDP that goes to advertising has been
   almost thermostatically constant, hovering between 1 and 1.5 percent
   for the last 90 years.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Spending on Advertising in the U.S. as a Percentage of GDP
     __________________________________________________________________

   As a large chunk of television moves toward an ad-light experience,
   tens of billions of dollars that used to fit in the nooks between Chuck
   Lorre comedies and Law & Order reruns will look for new homes. This
   isn’t a radical extrapolation; it’s already happening inside of pay TV.
   In Disney’s last quarter, subscription fees for its cable networks grew
   slightly while ad revenue declined 7 percent. CBS, the most-watched
   broadcast channel, is already "evolving away from the primary reliance
   on advertising revenues,” according to a recent report from the media
   research company MoffettNathanson.

   Where will the ad money go? To the Internet, naturally. (The other
   options—like print, podcasts, and radio—don’t seem like they’re poised
   to absorb billions of dollars in new advertising, although perhaps
   video games and augmented/virtual reality platforms will benefit.) And
   when it comes to digital advertising, there are really two companies
   that stand apart from the rest: Google and Facebook.

   Google and Facebook account for more than half of domestic mobile
   advertising. What’s more, they’re also growing faster than the rest of
   the market combined, and they’re both trying to build television-like
   products to keep users from leaving their ad-rich ecosystems.  Thus,
   wise strategy adjustments from Disney and other TV corporations may
   free up billions of dollars of revenue that several other media and
   technology companies will clamor for, but which Facebook and Google are
   uniquely poised to capture.

   This won’t be a sudden shift, and nothing in marketing is inevitable.
   If GEICO’s commercial business doesn’t want to pull away from TV, no
   one can make them. But television seems to be inexorably moving to a
   model where the cable bundle will continue to shrink among non-seniors,
   ad-light streaming products will grow in both total number and total
   subscribers, and TV advertising will be evermore concentrated in sports
   while much of the rest lurches toward the Internet. As I’ve written
   before, Netflix’s extraordinary success is the best thing that could
   have ever happened to digital advertising. And Google and Facebook, in
   particular, could not have designed a more effective corporate
   assassin.

    Trump Is Panicking

     * David A. Graham

   The president has lost control of the news cycle, and doesn’t know what
   to do next.

   When Donald Trump stepped to the dais at the United Nations General
   Assembly yesterday, he had a speech full of sharp lines: swipes at
   socialism, assertions of nationalism versus globalism, harsh words for
   Iran. Though Trump doesn’t enjoy delivering scripted remarks, he
   sounded listless, tired, and bored even by his own standards,
   struggling through the speech.

   The president had a good reason to be distracted. The same morning, he
   had spoken on the phone with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, trying to stem a
   growing tide of Democratic demands for his impeachment. According to
   NBC’s Heidi Przybyla, Trump asked Pelosi whether there was some way
   they could make a deal. Pelosi said the White House had to release the
   whistle-blower complaint to Congress, as required by statute. “Tell
   your people to obey the law,” she said.

I Used to Clean Houses. Then I Hired a Maid.

     * Stephanie Land

   I know how grueling the job can be, and I swore I’d never ask someone
   to do it for me. But then I found myself in need of help.

   Exactly one month before we got married, my fiancé and I made the final
   steps in combining our families. We were both full-time single
   parents—his kids 18 and 14, mine 12 and 5, with some dogs, fish, and a
   tortoise—moving into a house I described to acquaintances as “too big
   to clean” and to my close friends as, somewhat fondly, “a shithole.”

   “It’s worse than any house I’ve ever had to clean,” I told one friend.
   As someone who’d just published a whole memoir about cleaning houses,
   this description spoke to the level of grime, dust, grease, and dog
   urine throughout. “I can’t walk around in bare feet,” I said. “I’m
   going to have to deep-clean the place from top to bottom.”

   In interviews leading up to, during, and after the publication of my
   memoir, Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother’s Will to Survive, I was
   asked repeatedly whether I’d ever hire a housecleaner myself. “No,” I
   said, almost with my nose in the air. “I don’t want to live in a house
   that’s too big for me to clean myself.” A few times I laughed and said
   I’d never be able to afford a housecleaner because I’d tip so much,
   leaving $20 bills scattered about the house: one on the back of the
   toilet, one in the grimy bathtub, at least two in my kids’ bathroom.
   One reporter joked along with me, and then my eyes dropped down as I
   remembered the feeling of kneeling in front of a stranger’s toilet, and
   I said, “I could never ask someone to do that job.”

  The Most Dangerous Way to Lose Yourself

     * James Hamblin

   “Identity fusion” might explain why people act against their own
   interests.

   When John F. Kennedy was 17, he was part of a prank club. At
   Connecticut’s elite Choate school in 1935, word spread that the group
   was planning to pile horse manure in the gymnasium. Before this “prank”
   could happen, the school’s headmaster confronted the troublesome boys.
   The scheme was the culmination of a list of offenses at the school, and
   young Kennedy was expelled.

   Though the sentence was eventually reduced to probation, the headmaster
   suggested that Kennedy see a “gland specialist” to help him “overcome
   this strange childishness.” The doctor Kennedy ended up seeing was
   Prescott Lecky, a young, mutton-chopped psychologist. Lecky had made a
   name for himself at Columbia University as a skeptic of psychoanalytic
   theory, running up against Carl Jung and the Viennese establishment’s
   approach at the time. Instead of tracing Kennedy’s rebellious instincts
   to repressed motives or early-life stress, Lecky interrogated the boy’s
   sense of self.

  We Spent 10 Months Investigating Kavanaugh. Here’s What We Found.

     * Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin

   Two journalists detail the results of their reporting on the Supreme
   Court justice’s past.

   Years ago, when she was practicing her closing arguments at the family
   dinner table, Martha Kavanaugh often returned to her signature line as
   a state prosecutor. “Use your common sense,” she’d say. “What rings
   true? What rings false?”

   Those words made a strong impression on her young son, Brett. They also
   made a strong impression on us, as we embarked on our 10-month
   investigation of the Supreme Court justice. We conducted hundreds of
   interviews with principal players in Kavanaugh’s education, career, and
   confirmation. We read thousands of documents. We reviewed hours of
   television interviews, along with reams of newspaper, magazine, and
   digital coverage. We studied maps of Montgomery Country, Maryland, as
   well as housing-renovation plans and court records. We watched
   Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings multiple times.

  Trump Is Not Well

     * Peter Wehner

   Accepting the reality about the president’s disordered personality is
   important—even essential.

   During the 2016 campaign, I received a phone call from an influential
   political journalist and author, who was soliciting my thoughts on
   Donald Trump. Trump’s rise in the Republican Party was still something
   of a shock, and he wanted to know the things I felt he should keep in
   mind as he went about the task of covering Trump.

   At the top of my list: Talk to psychologists and psychiatrists about
   the state of Trump’s mental health, since I considered that to be the
   most important thing when it came to understanding him. It was Trump’s
   Rosetta stone.

   I wasn’t shy about making the same case publicly. During a July 14,
   2016, appearance on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, for example, I
   responded to a pro-Trump caller who was upset that I opposed Trump
   despite my having been a Republican for my entire adult life and having
   served in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations and the
   George W. Bush White House.

  The Oceans We Know Won’t Survive Climate Change

     * Robinson Meyer

   Sea-level rise will become unmanageable, and life will flee the world’s
   tropical oceans, if carbon pollution keeps rising, a new report from
   the UN climate panel says.

   Today a baby girl was born. Consider the years of her life—how she’ll
   think back to her childhood in the ’20s (the 2020s) and become a
   teenager in the ’30s. If she’s an American citizen, she’ll cast her
   first vote for president in the 2040 election; she might graduate from
   college a year or two later. In the year 2050, she’ll turn 31, and
   she’ll be both fully grown up and young enough to look to the end of
   the century—and imagine she may get to see it.

   We hold the fate of that girl—and of the society she inhabits—in our
   hands. That’s the message of a blockbuster new report, released today,
   from the United Nations–led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC).

   While the report covers how climate change is reshaping the oceans and
   ice sheets, its deeper focus is how water, in all its forms, is closely
   tied to human flourishing. If our water-related problems are relatively
   easy to manage, then the problem of self-government is also easier. But
   if we keep spewing carbon pollution into the air, then the resulting
   planetary upheaval would constitute “a major strike against the human
   endeavor,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a lead author of the report and a
   professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton.

  Why Greta Makes Adults Uncomfortable

     * Robinson Meyer

   Especially in private, she sounds a lot like … a teenager.

   In a very short time, Greta Thunberg—with her searing stare, Pippi
   Longstocking braids, and hand-painted sign reading SKOLSTREJK FÖR
   KLIMATET—has become a global icon. A year ago, the 16-year-old Swedish
   climate activist began striking from school each Friday to protest
   climate inaction; last Friday, she gave a speech to hundreds of
   thousands of people in New York, at the Global Climate Strike, which
   was inspired by her protest.

   It is always at least a little unfortunate to see a young person become
   an icon—it robs them of the privacy of growing up. But Thunberg is an
   especially flummoxing figure. She looks younger than her years, yet her
   speeches take a shaming, authoritative tone that is, at the very least,
   unusual for a child. “How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my
   childhood,” she told world leaders at the United Nations today. She has
   also said that money and eternal economic growth are “fairy tales.” So
   she has inspired both public adoration and malign theorizing (mostly
   centered around the power of her parents).

  Why Are American Homes So Big?

     * Joe Pinsker

   The U.S. is in the top tier of house sizes internationally—and it’s not
   just because of McMansions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   America is a place defined by bigness. It is infamous, both within its
   borders and abroad, for the size of its cars, its portions, its defense
   budget—and its houses.

   Rightly so: U.S. houses are among the biggest—if not the biggest—in the
   world. According to the real-estate firms Zillow and Redfin, the median
   size of an American single-family home is in the neighborhood of 1,600
   or 1,650 square feet. About five years ago, Sonia A. Hirt, a professor
   of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia,
   was working on a book about land-use patterns in the U.S., and when she
   tracked down the average size of dwellings for about two dozen
   countries, the U.S. came out on top. Her comparisons were rough because
   she’d cobbled together her data from various sources, but she found
   that American living spaces had a good 600 to 800 square feet on most
   of the competition.

  What Pelosi’s Pivot on Impeachment Really Means

     * Russell Berman and Elaine Godfrey

   Is this a defining moment in the Trump presidency, or merely some
   creative packaging?

   When Speaker Nancy Pelosi solemnly announced that the House of
   Representatives would open an impeachment inquiry against President
   Donald Trump shortly after 5 p.m. on Tuesday, everything changed. Or
   maybe nothing changed at all.

   On the one hand, the most powerful woman in America had just
   unequivocally thrown her support behind an official effort to remove
   the president from office, abandoning her long-standing opposition to
   such a drastic move. On the other, Pelosi had merely offered her
   endorsement of a process—an investigation to determine whether to
   recommend articles of impeachment—that was already under way in the
   House.

   Pelosi announced no new select committee to handle Trump’s impeachment.
   She provided no timetable for its consideration. She gave no guarantee
   that the House would even vote to charge the president, much less adopt
   articles that would prompt a trial in the Senate.

  My Husband Paid Me to Do Housework

     * Sophie Knight

   We wanted to address a systemic, gendered imbalance. It didn’t really
   work.

   A couple of years ago, I started invoicing my husband for housework. It
   made sense to us: While our goal was to divide the work equally, I
   ended up doing much more because he worked in an office and I worked at
   home as a freelancer, using my breaks to cook, vacuum, and do laundry.

   We split all our bills down the middle, except for rent, which we each
   paid in proportion to our income. But if we felt financially even, we
   didn’t when it came to time. It seemed unfair that I was doing most of
   the housework, even if I found it easy to fit into my day and was more
   proficient at it. So we came up with a system: He would pay me for
   every hour of housework I did more than him. We set my rate at €11.50
   (about $13, at the time) an hour—the price of a cleaner where we lived,
   in the Netherlands. This seemed like a way to ease my resentment, to
   make our chore imbalance visible, and (I hoped) to incentivize him to
   take on more tasks.

                         Is Lab-Grown Meat Good for Us?

   No saturated fat, no heme iron, no growth hormone—cultured meat seems
   to have many potential benefits.


    Marta Zaraska

   Aug 19, 2013

   Conventional meat (the kind that grows inside animals, not petri
   dishes) is, in several ways, not exactly good for our health. Research
   shows that regularly indulging can lead to higher risk of heart
   disease, diabetes, and some kinds of cancer.

   Professor Mark Post of the University of Maastricht, the scientist
   behind the first in-vitro burger, believes that test tube meat will be
   better for us. “We gain greater control over what the meat consists of,
   for example its fat content,” he says. “And the reduction in the number
   of farmed animals reduces the chance of zoonosis,“ or infectious
   diseases that spread from animals to people. So how exactly could meat
   grown in labs be better for our health than the meat that is grown in
   cows or pigs?

   According to Joan Salge Blake, spokesperson for the Academy of
   Nutrition and Dietetics, one of the key factors is saturated fat. “If
   they are going to make their own fats, they will be able to replace the
   saturated fatty acids with, for example, omega-3 fatty acids,” she
   said.

   While saturated fatty acids are known to contribute to cardiovascular
   disease and type 2 diabetes, omega-3s (found naturally in fish or
   flaxseed oil) are a healthier option—they reduce inflammation and may
   help lower risk of heart disease and arthritis. If Post is right, and
   in 10 to 20 years we have lab-grown burgers and sausages on the shelves
   of our supermarkets, they may well come in “no cholesterol” and “no
   saturated fats” varieties.

   They might come in “no heme iron” versions, too. Post’s burger was most
   likely heme-iron free. In the future, he says, “it is conceivable that
   we will try and make reduced heme-iron containing meat.”

   Conventional wisdom says that heme iron, the type of iron found only in
   meat and fish, is actually good for us. After all, it’s much better
   absorbed by the body than the iron found commonly in plants (called
   non-heme iron), and, as such, more likely to keep anemia at bay. Yet
   recent studies show that there is also a darker side to heme iron. If
   consumed, it may raise the risk of heart disease and some cancers. It
   has also been linked to type 2 diabetes.

   “Both the iron and the fat content of the meat are likely relevant
   risks for this disease,” says Desley White, lecturer in dietetics at
   Plymouth University, and the author of a study on dietary heme iron
   which appeared in the July issue of Advances in Nutrition. She points
   out, though, that heme iron is only partly to blame for type 2
   diabetes. “If you ate only cultured meat, heme iron-free, yet kept the
   same [amount] of activity, and stayed overweight, I doubt you would
   avoid diabetes, though you might delay it for some time. But if eating
   fat-free cultured meat would also mean a drop in calorie intake, then
   there would be an added decrease in diabetes risk,” she says.

   It is also possible that the cultured meats of the future may not
   contain L-carnitine, a substance found naturally in red meat (but also
   present in much smaller amounts in fish, poultry, asparagus and
   avocados) —and that is likely good news, too. A study published in
   April in Nature Medicine showed that L-carnitine gets broken down by
   bacteria in the gut, and that a chemical resulting from this process
   ups the risk of heart disease.

   If in vitro meats were produced using current technology, they could
   lack nutrients that are essential for good health. Post’s beef patty
   (which was really just a proof of concept), consisted only of muscle
   fibers. There was no fat in it, no blood or blood vessels, no
   connective tissues. This, according to Post, means that the range of
   nutrients in cultured beef would be different than in conventional
   meat. But he and his colleagues are working to change that. “Once all
   of these other components are included in cultured meat there is no
   reason for it to be less healthy than conventional meat,” he says.

   Physician Neal Barnard, the author of several studies on red meat’s
   impact on health, believes that just like we now have orange juice
   fortified with Vitamin D, in the future we could heave cultured steaks
   or bacon fortified with Vitamin B12 (which we need to keep our nerve
   and blood cells healthy). “We have not looked into it yet, but it’s
   possible,” Post said.

   Yet the story of healthy (or unhealthy) meats is not just a story of
   nutrients, of fats and of cholesterol. This story begins on farms.
   Nowadays, most animals raised for meat are raised in CAFOs—confined
   animal feeding operations. CAFOs not only lead to animal suffering, but
   also dirt, drugs, and disease. Workers employed in CAFOs may suffer
   from asthma, eye inflammation, and chronic bronchitis. That, obviously,
   would not be an issue for technicians growing meat in sterile labs.

   What’s more, pollution from factory farms is a health hazard for
   surrounding communities. A study conducted in North Carolina found that
   people who live near hog farms have more headaches, runny noses,
   diarrhea, and burning eyes than those who live in cleaner
   neighborhoods. CAFOs also risk contaminating drinking water with
   nitrates from the animals’ waste. If ingested, nitrates may cause
   miscarriages, certain types of cancers, congenital malformations, and a
   “blue baby syndrome”—a condition which can cause comas in infants.

   Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment of
   Animals, points out that replacing CAFOs with labs will mean replacing
   dirt with sterility. “There will be health benefits for us, because
   this meat will be clean,” she says. According to the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention, meat and poultry are the most common
   food sources of fatal infections, responsible for 29 percent of
   food-poisoning related deaths in the U.S., largely due to Salmonella
   and Listeria infections. Salmonella are bacteria that live in the
   intestinal tracts of animals such as cattle or poultry. When the
   animals are stressed (which happens often in CAFOs and
   slaughterhouses), they shed large amounts of this bacteria into their
   feces, which can contaminate the meat. Later, if it’s undercooked or
   badly handled, this can mean food poisoning. In recent months 134
   people in 13 states were infected with a strain of Salmonella from
   chicken meat.

   Eating conventional meat can also lead to listeria, E. coli or
   Campylobacter infections. It can mean toxoplasmosis (dangerous for
   pregnant women) or, in rare cases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. That
   doesn’t mean that lab-grown meat would be 100 percent safe, just much
   safer. Professor Amee Manges of the University of British Columbia, who
   has published studies on food-borne pathogens, points out that cultured
   meat could still get infected with bacteria during processing.

   Cultured meat—at least produced the way Post does it—would also mean no
   growth hormones (banned in the European Union, but still approved for
   use in Canada and the U.S.), which according to the EU’s Scientific
   Committee for Veterinary Measures, can have “developmental,
   neurobiological, and carcinogenic effects.” Lab grown meat would not
   contain residues of pesticides (applied to the animals to control
   insects), no tranquillizers, no de-wormers.

   For now, though, lab-grown meats still require the use of antibiotics.
   In conventional meat production antibiotics are given routinely to
   healthy animals to promote growth. They are used so freely, that
   according to the Food and Drug Administration, they now constitute 72
   percent of all U.S. antibiotic sales. This, in turn, can lead to the
   emergence of resistant bacteria. Post’s lab-grown beef required
   antibiotics, too. “Cultured muscle has no immune system, so it was
   necessary. In the future, once production is scaled up and automated,
   it could be done in closed sterile systems so the antibiotics will no
   longer be needed,” he says.

   With meat grown in sterile labs, we could also worry less about
   emerging diseases, such as avian flu and swine flu, which are
   associated with intensive farming. And if scientists could produce
   exotic meats like chimpanzee in their petri dishes, there would be less
   risk of retroviruses and herpes being imported with bushmeat into the
   U.S. from Africa. Right now, 180,000 pounds of bushmeat enters our
   country illegally each year. According to Post, growing exotic meats in
   a lab wouldn’t be much more difficult than growing beef or chicken.

   Yet there remains the problem of the “yuck factor” of what many already
   call “frankenmeat.” Some worry that we don’t know what eating stem
   cells may mean for our health down the road. Peter Verstrate, a food
   technician who worked with Post on the development of the cultured
   beef, reassures: “Stem cells are everywhere. In your muscle tissue
   there are stem cells, too. The only thing we do is take them out and
   tell them to multiply and to become muscle tissue. Just like they do in
   your arm or in your leg when you have a wound, to repair the muscle.”

           Rising Instagram Stars Are Posting Fake Sponsored Content

   “It’s street cred—the more sponsors you have, the more credibility you
   have.”


    Taylor Lorenz

   Tapping through Palak Joshi’s Instagram Stories recently, you might
   have come across a photo that looked like standard sponsored content: a
   shiny white box emblazoned with the red logo for the Chinese phone
   manufacturer OnePlus and the number six, shot from above on a concrete
   background. It featured the branded hashtag tied to the phone’s launch,
   and tagged OnePlus’s Instagram handle. And it looked similar to posts
   from the company itself announcing the launch of its new Android phone.
   Joshi’s post, however, wasn’t an ad. “It looked sponsored, but it’s
   not,” she said. Her followers are none the wiser. “They just assume
   everything is sponsored when it really isn’t,” she said. And she wants
   it that way.

   A decade ago, shilling products to your fans may have been seen as
   selling out. Now it’s a sign of success. “People know how much
   influencers charge now, and that payday is nothing to shake a stick
   at,” said Alyssa Vingan Klein, the editor in chief of Fashionista, a
   fashion-news website. “If someone who is 20 years old watching YouTube
   or Instagram sees these people traveling with brands, promoting brands,
   I don’t see why they wouldn’t do everything they could to get in on
   that.”

   But transitioning from an average Instagram or YouTube user to a
   professional “influencer”—that is, someone who leverages a social-media
   following to influence others and make money—is not easy. After
   archiving old photos, redefining your aesthetic, and growing your
   follower base to at least the quadruple digits, you’ll want to approach
   brands. But the hardest deal to land is your first, several influencers
   say; companies want to see your promotional abilities and past campaign
   work. So many have adopted a new strategy: Fake it until you make it.

   Sydney Pugh, a lifestyle influencer in Los Angeles, recently staged a
   fake ad for a local cafe, purchasing her own mug of coffee,
   photographing it, and adding a promotional caption carefully written in
   that particular style of ad speak anyone who spends a lot of time on
   Instagram will recognize. “Instead of [captioning] ‘I need coffee to
   get through the day,’ mine will say ‘I love Alfred’s coffee because of
   A, B, C,’” Pugh told me. “You see the same things over and over on
   actual sponsored posts, so it becomes really easy to emulate, even if
   you’re not getting paid.”

   When a local amusement park paid several bloggers to attend the venue
   and post about their experience there, Joshi, a fashion and lifestyle
   influencer, went on her own dime and posted promotional posts as if she
   were part of the bigger influencer campaign.

   Taylor Evans took the fake-“sponcon” game one step further, once faking
   the entire purpose of a trip to Miami. Technically, she was just there
   on vacation, paying her own way for everything, but on Instagram she
   positioned it as an exclusive press trip. “I took a lot of pics at
   restaurants and posted ‘Thanks so much XYZ restaurant for the
   hospitality!’” she said. “You say it in a way that people could
   interpret it as you having an established relationship with that brand
   … The hope is that it’s perceived in a way that looks like there’s a
   reason you’re in a different city and state, not just enjoying a
   weekend vacation.”

     posts. welcome 2 the Internet
     — Justine Dorsey (@justinedorsey) January 23, 2017

   Jason Wong, the founder of the false-eyelash company Doux Lashes, said
   he’s surprised at the levels to which aspiring influencers have gone to
   promote his brand for free. “Normally influencers did one post for one
   product,” he said. Now “we’ve seen influencers do two to three posts
   for one product. They want to have a continuous stream of content to
   make it seem like it’s sponsored.”

   Monica Ahanonu, an illustrator and Instagram influencer with nearly
   12,000 followers, said that fake ads have become so common that she’s
   not even sure who is sponsored and who is pretending. While the Federal
   Trade Commission recently ruled that paid advertisements must be
   disclosed, influencers regularly flout those guidelines. And there are
   no rules against people who aren’t paid captioning their photos to make
   them sound like paid disclosures. Ahanonu herself posted an Instagram
   recently featuring custom artwork promoting a Chanel cosmetics kit. She
   didn’t receive payment or any product in exchange, but her post would
   look right at home among other Chanel ads.

   For the average consumer, things become blurry quickly. Many fashion
   influencers tag the brands they’re using in photos, whether the clothes
   were purchased, given to them for free, or are part of an ad campaign.
   Lifestyle blogging is all about seamlessly monetizing your good taste
   and consumer choices, which means it can be near-impossible for
   laypeople to tell if an influencer genuinely loves a product, is being
   paid to talk about it, or just wants to be paid to talk about it.

   When Allie, a 15-year-old lifestyle influencer who asked to be referred
   to by a pseudonym, scrolls through her Instagram feed, sometimes the
   whole thing seems like an ad. There’s a fellow teen beauty influencer
   bragging about her sponsorship with Maybelline, a high-school sophomore
   she knows touting his brand campaign with Voss water. None of these
   promotions, however, is real. Allie is friends with the people posting,
   so she knows. She once faked a water sponsorship herself. “People
   pretend to have brand deals to seem cool,” Allie said. “It’s a thing,
   like, I got this for free while all you losers are paying.”

   “In the influencer world, it’s street cred,” said Brian Phanthao, a
   19-year-old lifestyle influencer in San Diego who sees fake ads all
   over Instagram. “The more sponsors you have, the more credibility you
   have.”

   Phanthao said most of the people he sees doing it grew up watching
   influencers and now aspire to their lifestyle. “It’s really common with
   kids in high school,” he said. “They’re very influenced by
   influencers.” At first he was astounded that brands he recognized would
   partner with some of the people he saw on his feed. But when he
   cross-checked the brands’ websites, he couldn’t find their names.

     this girl I know really had a sponcon themed bday party. wow what an
     example of fake it til u make it.
     — Jessica Jacolbe (@jessjoycej) April 30, 2018

   Henry, a 15-year-old beauty influencer who asked to be referred to by
   his first name only, said he doesn’t post fake ads himself, but said he
   noticed his social status rise as he got more attention online this
   year. “People come up to me at school like, ‘Do you get sponsored?’” he
   said. “When I say I do they’re like, ‘OMG that’s so cool.’ I noticed
   the more followers I gain, the more people in the hall come up and talk
   to me.”

   Read: Posting Instagram sponsored content is the new summer job

   But of course, clout is just a means to an end, and ultimately, most of
   the people posting fake ads hope to eventually get paid to post real
   ones. Evans said staging these fake promotions “makes you seem like
   you’re in a position to be getting things for free, which helps you
   build your brand or media kit … It makes you seem more established,
   like you have brands that you’re working with. That means you’re
   producing good content and you’re worthy of approaching and offering
   these opportunities to.”

   After Samantha Leibowitz-Bienstock, a lifestyle influencer who posts
   under the name Trendy Ambitious Blonde, posted a photo of herself with
   a Betsey Johnson bag she purchased with her own money and tagged the
   company, she was featured on its website. She wasn’t paid, but she
   considered it a win for her personal brand.

   But while some companies are thrilled with the free promotion, for
   others it’s become a headache. The owner of one sunglasses brand, who
   asked to remain anonymous so as not to alienate anyone in the
   influencer community, said the practice has put him in a tough position
   as a stream of mid-level influencers post mediocre-quality sponsored
   content seemingly on his behalf, without his approval or control.

   He has seen influencers thanking his brand for “working with” them when
   he knew they had never partnered. “We do encourage our fans to put our
   stuff on Instagram. That’s how we grow,” he said. But he added that he
   was worried that some people appearing to be brand ambassadors could
   ultimately damage his business’s reputation. Though he has considered
   it, he has never reached out to any of the influencers and asked them
   to take their post down. To him, that feels like even more of a risk.
   “These people are looking for the most amount of attention, so if they
   want to make it seem like they’ve been wronged in any way by a brand,
   they will,” he said.

   And then there’s the fact that fake sponcon misleads would-be partners.
   Wong was once a Tumblr star himself, and he knows the ins and outs of
   online marketing. But even he was recently duped. After hiring one
   influencer to promote his product, he later found out that all of her
   brand deals were fake. Now he cross-references all potential partners,
   calling up other brands they’ve claimed to work with to see if that
   work was paid.

     If I see any more “self made entrepreneurs” flexing their rented
     Lamborghinis and fake Rollies in sponsored posts on Instagram I am
     ending it all
     — Sinferna (@withthedraco) October 4, 2018

   Though it may seem like a useful tactic when you’re starting out, more
   established influencers worry that fake sponcon is creating a race to
   the bottom. Because brands can piggyback off of waves of unpaid
   influencer promoters, some have ceased paying influencers completely,
   or now pay rates far below what they previously spent.

   “I don’t think people know they’re screwing each other over,” said CJ
   OperAmericano, a 22-year-old TikTok star. She has watched rates plummet
   as the industry becomes more saturated, and she recently lost out on a
   brand campaign to someone who offered to do it for a tenth of the
   price. People now treat brand deals “like a verification badge,” she
   said.

   Vingan Klein said she can’t blame the young fashion influencers she
   sees coming up today for their hustle. “Trying to get sponsored is your
   way out of this rat race,” she said. Teens today realize that “you
   don’t have to go up this hierarchy; you can skip the middleman,” she
   added. “Besides, what do the followers know?”

        China Is Going to Outrageous Lengths to Surveil Its Own Citizens

   New tech—including drones disguised as birds—can be a nightmare for
   Muslims in particular.

   China has reportedly begun deploying flocks of drones disguised as
   birds to surveil its citizens. The drones have wings that flap so
   realistically they’re difficult to distinguish from actual birds. In
   fact, animals on the ground often can’t make the distinction, and even
   real birds in the sky sometimes fly alongside the drones. One
   researcher involved in the project has claimed that the robotic birds
   can mimic 90 percent of the movements of their biological counterparts,
   and they’re also very quiet, which helps them avoid detection.

   The operation’s codename is “Dove”—but there’s reason to doubt whether
   these machines come in peace. Yang Wenqing, a member of the team behind
   Dove, said the technology has “some unique advantages to meet the
   demand for drones in the military and civilian sectors” and “good
   potential for large-scale use in the future.”

   Headlines about technologies like these gaining traction in China have
   been appearing in the news with alarming frequency. Facial-recognition
   tech is now used for everything from catching criminals in huge crowds
   to detecting and shaming jaywalkers to deciding whether someone can get
   an extra square of toilet paper in a public bathroom. Some employees
   have to wear helmets that scan their brainwaves for rage, depression,
   anxiety, or fatigue, and that alert their bosses to any perceived
   problem. Then there’s the country’s social credit system, which
   monitors millions of individuals’ behavior (including via social media
   and online shopping), determines how moral or immoral it is, and raises
   or lowers their “citizen score” accordingly. Those with a high score
   are rewarded, while those with a low score are punished.

   Even in a country known for its extreme spying on its entire
   population, the degree of surveillance targeting Muslims in particular
   is unnerving. An estimated 22 to 25 million Muslims live in China, out
   of a total population of 1.4 billion. Last year, a Freedom House study
   found that extensive surveillance affects many religious groups, with
   Muslims as well as Protestant Christians and Tibetan Buddhists
   experiencing an increase in persecution over the previous five years.
   In an interview this week, Timothy Grose, a China expert at the Rose
   Hulman Institute of Technology, told me, “Right now, we see a lot of
   the repression being directed against Muslims.”

   Chinese tech isn’t the enemy

   The Dove program’s bird-like drones have been flown over five provinces
   so far, and it’s perhaps no coincidence that they’ve been used
   extensively in one area in particular: Xinjiang, a northwestern region
   heavily populated by Uighurs, a largely Muslim ethnic minority. The
   government has long considered the region a breeding ground for
   separatism and extremism. Ethnic riots there killed hundreds in 2009,
   and some Uighurs have perpetrated terror attacks in recent years. The
   area is now subject to a heightened level of surveillance, with
   authorities collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, voice
   samples, and blood types from residents.

   “They’re applying a very, very broad attempted solution to what they
   see as an ideological danger. In Xinjiang, the definition of extremism
   has expanded so far as to incorporate virtually anything you do as a
   Muslim,” James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown
   University, told me. The amount of surveillance directed at that
   region’s 11 million Uighurs, he added, is “certainly disproportionate”
   relative to that directed at other groups. “Islam is now effectively
   being demonized in China.”

   This month, 11,500 Chinese Muslims are heading to Mecca on the annual
   Hajj pilgrimage. Before leaving the country, some of the pilgrims were
   given state-issued tracking devices, in the form of “smart cards”
   attached to lanyards around their necks. The devices bear GPS trackers
   and customized personal data. The state-run China Islamic Association
   says they’re intended to ensure the pilgrims’ safety. (There is
   legitimate reason for such concerns: During the 2015 Hajj, a stampede
   killed more than 750 pilgrims.) But some human-rights experts say this
   is one more effort to surveil Muslims. The government’s fear, according
   to a Human Rights Watch report, is that religious pilgrimages could act
   as “potential cover for subversive political activity.”

   “I don’t use what comes out of human-rights organizations uncritically,
   but here’s one case where I would definitely side with them,” Grose
   said. “The pilgrims are always accompanied by an official guide,
   essentially a monitor, who represents the Chinese Islamic Association,
   which represents the state. Their movements are always under
   supervision. Their schedules are airtight, with very little room for
   any extracurricular activities. So the use of GPS in an already tightly
   put-together schedule just seems too redundant [if it’s about safety].
   To me, it’s about: ‘Well, what if one of them sneaks away, and we need
   to find out where he is and if he’s talking to someone and bringing
   back with him an interpretation of Islam that doesn’t accord with [what
   the government] has been promoting?’”

   China’s new frontiers in dystopian tech

   Muslims are also experiencing larger human-rights violations in China.
   An estimated 1 million Uighurs are reportedly being held without trial
   in detention camps, where they’re forced to memorize Communist Party
   propaganda, criticize their own previous religious behavior, and
   renounce Islam, including by eating pork and drinking alcohol. China
   issued a denial Monday after a United Nations human-rights panel said
   last Friday that it’s seen many credible reports alleging that a
   million Uighurs are held in what resembles a “massive internment camp
   that is shrouded in secrecy.” In July, the U.S. State Department
   expressed deep concern about the “possibly millions” of Muslims in the
   camps, and an earlier U.S. commission called it “the largest mass
   incarceration of a minority population in the world today.”

   Although China has been mostly targeting Uighurs, it’s also detaining
   Muslim members of other ethnic groups like Kazakhs. If Uighurs and
   Kazakhs—both Turkic peoples—are taking the brunt of the maltreatment,
   it’s likely because the Chinese authorities see them as a threat to the
   integrity of the country, with Uighur separatists aspiring to their own
   national homeland (they refer to Xinjiang as East Turkestan) and
   Kazakhs maintaining foreign contacts across the border in Kazakhstan.

   “The Chinese government thinks that these Turkic Muslims have incorrect
   thoughts,” Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch,
   wrote in an email, “because they identify more with Turks and Muslims
   in Turkey and Central Asia. To correct these thoughts, and to make them
   loyal subjects of the Chinese Communist Party, it needs to reengineer
   their identities and to tightly control them.”

   For his part, Grose said, “The Chinese Communist Party allows for and
   even celebrates most ethnic diversity. But when that’s animated by
   religious nationalism, that’s what the Party fears—because those are
   forces that originate outside China, which they can’t control.”

   Chinese experiments in surveillance are having an impact elsewhere in
   the world: Some of the new tech the authorities seem to try out on
   Uighur Muslims is later applied more broadly in the country and then
   exported abroad. “Xinjiang provides a testing ground from which they
   can then try it in larger places,” Grose said. Chinese firms have
   already sold their surveillance tech to countries like Malaysia,
   Pakistan, and Zimbabwe, and may soon gain a foothold in Europe, too.

                     TV’s Ad Apocalypse Is Getting Closer

   Disney’s decision to build its own streaming service is smart. It’s
   also the latest sign that the traditional cable bundle is doomed.


    Derek Thompson

   Aug 10, 2017

   Mike Blake / Reuters

   Disney announced on Tuesday that it will stop selling content to
   Netflix by 2019 and will instead launch two streaming services—one with
   sports content from ESPN (which it owns) and another for movies. It is
   a dramatic announcement with far-reaching implications for the future
   of television and, pulling back the lens even farther, the U.S. tech
   and media landscape.

   Before getting to the future, let’s start with the present of
   television. Pay TV—that is, the bundle of channels one can buy from
   Comcast or DirecTV—is in a ratings free fall among all viewers born
   since the Nixon administration. Since 2010, the time that Americans
   under 35 have spent watching television has declined by about 50
   percent, according to Matthew Ball, the head of strategy at Amazon
   Studios.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As a result, Disney’s cable-television business, once the crown jewel
   of the company, is now weighing down its stock. Where are its viewers
   going? Many have decamped for streaming services like Netflix, where
   the number of hours of video entertainment consumed has grown by about
   700 percent in the same time.

   This has created a business crisis for entertainment companies like
   Disney. Old Disney’s television strategy was: Focus on making great
   content and then sell it to distribution companies, like Comcast and
   DirecTV. This worked brilliantly when practically the entire country
   subscribed to the same television product. For example, when Disney
   sold its goods to Comcast, it stimulated demand for the cable bundle,
   which meant more people had access to ESPN, which meant ESPN’s
   advertising revenues soared, which meant Disney profited. Thanks to
   virtuous cycle of bundling, separating content and distribution used to
   be the obvious play for Disney.

   But New Disney is looking for a fresh play. Now that young households
   are cutting the cord, it wants to own both content and distribution.
   Netflix once famously said that it wanted to be HBO before HBO could be
   Netflix; that is, to become a great content company before HBO could
   become a technology company. With this week’s announcement, Disney is
   declaring that it wants to rival Netflix, as a streaming competitor,
   before Netflix can rival Disney, as a prodigious content-owner and
   rights-holder.

   This move may be necessary, but it’s awfully risky. Disney is the envy
   of the entertainment industry by virtue of its catalogue, which
   includes Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and a legendary animated-films
   portfolio. Its ability to re-merchandize its most popular content, with
   amusement parks, toys, and sequels, is unparalleled. But it is not a
   technology company. There aren't many great examples of legacy media
   empires successfully transitioning to the digital age without a few
   disasters along the way, or at least a long period of readjustment.
   Just look at American newspapers, or the music labels at the beginning
   of the 2000s.

   This announcement is only days old, but it’s not too early to
   anticipate the furthest-reaching implications of “Disneyflix” on the
   future of media and technology.

   Disney’s streaming products will debut in a crowded marketplace.
   Netflix has 50 million domestic subscribers. Hulu has 12 million. Tens
   of millions more subscribe to Amazon Video, as part of their Prime
   subscriptions. Disneyflix will start from way behind, and it will have
   to offer something compelling—on price, quality, or convenience—to get
   millions of people to pay for yet another TV thing. What might its
   pitch include?

   One seemingly banal prediction would be commercial-free access to its
   incredible catalogue of films. Or, at least, very few commercials for
   non-sports content. (Sports rights are expensive, and live sports often
   has so many breaks that it would be weird if there's weren't commercial
   interstitials. ) This seems like a pretty modest offering. After all,
   Netflix and Amazon already offer an ad-free experience.

   But play this out: Imagine that the Disney bundle is seen as a modest
   success, as is possible given the strength of its current catalogue.
   Other media companies might follow suit, and, before long, there might
   be an NBCUniversal bundle, a 21st Century Fox bundle, and a Time Warner
   bundle. All of these streaming services would be jostling for America’s
   limited entertainment budget and limited TV-viewing time. They would
   all feel the pressure to lure subscribers with the promise of fewer
   ads, or a commercial-free experience.

   Where would this leave U.S. TV advertising, which companies spend $40
   billion a year on? Very endangered. After all, each ad-free streaming
   product is yet another reason to dump the ad-rich cable bundle.

   “All right,” one might think. “So more and more Americans will see
   fewer and fewer commercials. This is a really boring hypothetical.”

   Except that $40 billion of advertising won’t just disappear. Ad dollars
   never do. The share of U.S. GDP that goes to advertising has been
   almost thermostatically constant, hovering between 1 and 1.5 percent
   for the last 90 years.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Spending on Advertising in the U.S. as a Percentage of GDP
     __________________________________________________________________

   As a large chunk of television moves toward an ad-light experience,
   tens of billions of dollars that used to fit in the nooks between Chuck
   Lorre comedies and Law & Order reruns will look for new homes. This
   isn’t a radical extrapolation; it’s already happening inside of pay TV.
   In Disney’s last quarter, subscription fees for its cable networks grew
   slightly while ad revenue declined 7 percent. CBS, the most-watched
   broadcast channel, is already "evolving away from the primary reliance
   on advertising revenues,” according to a recent report from the media
   research company MoffettNathanson.

   Where will the ad money go? To the Internet, naturally. (The other
   options—like print, podcasts, and radio—don’t seem like they’re poised
   to absorb billions of dollars in new advertising, although perhaps
   video games and augmented/virtual reality platforms will benefit.) And
   when it comes to digital advertising, there are really two companies
   that stand apart from the rest: Google and Facebook.

   Google and Facebook account for more than half of domestic mobile
   advertising. What’s more, they’re also growing faster than the rest of
   the market combined, and they’re both trying to build television-like
   products to keep users from leaving their ad-rich ecosystems.  Thus,
   wise strategy adjustments from Disney and other TV corporations may
   free up billions of dollars of revenue that several other media and
   technology companies will clamor for, but which Facebook and Google are
   uniquely poised to capture.

   This won’t be a sudden shift, and nothing in marketing is inevitable.
   If GEICO’s commercial business doesn’t want to pull away from TV, no
   one can make them. But television seems to be inexorably moving to a
   model where the cable bundle will continue to shrink among non-seniors,
   ad-light streaming products will grow in both total number and total
   subscribers, and TV advertising will be evermore concentrated in sports
   while much of the rest lurches toward the Internet. As I’ve written
   before, Netflix’s extraordinary success is the best thing that could
   have ever happened to digital advertising. And Google and Facebook, in
   particular, could not have designed a more effective corporate
   assassin.

     * Trump speaks at the United Nations Jonathan Ernst / Reuters
    Trump Is Panicking

     * David A. Graham

   The president has lost control of the news cycle, and doesn’t know what
   to do next.

   When Donald Trump stepped to the dais at the United Nations General
   Assembly yesterday, he had a speech full of sharp lines: swipes at
   socialism, assertions of nationalism versus globalism, harsh words for
   Iran. Though Trump doesn’t enjoy delivering scripted remarks, he
   sounded listless, tired, and bored even by his own standards,
   struggling through the speech.

   The president had a good reason to be distracted. The same morning, he
   had spoken on the phone with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, trying to stem a
   growing tide of Democratic demands for his impeachment. According to
   NBC’s Heidi Przybyla, Trump asked Pelosi whether there was some way
   they could make a deal. Pelosi said the White House had to release the
   whistle-blower complaint to Congress, as required by statute. “Tell
   your people to obey the law,” she said.

I Used to Clean Houses. Then I Hired a Maid.

     * Stephanie Land

   I know how grueling the job can be, and I swore I’d never ask someone
   to do it for me. But then I found myself in need of help.

   Exactly one month before we got married, my fiancé and I made the final
   steps in combining our families. We were both full-time single
   parents—his kids 18 and 14, mine 12 and 5, with some dogs, fish, and a
   tortoise—moving into a house I described to acquaintances as “too big
   to clean” and to my close friends as, somewhat fondly, “a shithole.”

   “It’s worse than any house I’ve ever had to clean,” I told one friend.
   As someone who’d just published a whole memoir about cleaning houses,
   this description spoke to the level of grime, dust, grease, and dog
   urine throughout. “I can’t walk around in bare feet,” I said. “I’m
   going to have to deep-clean the place from top to bottom.”

   In interviews leading up to, during, and after the publication of my
   memoir, Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother’s Will to Survive, I was
   asked repeatedly whether I’d ever hire a housecleaner myself. “No,” I
   said, almost with my nose in the air. “I don’t want to live in a house
   that’s too big for me to clean myself.” A few times I laughed and said
   I’d never be able to afford a housecleaner because I’d tip so much,
   leaving $20 bills scattered about the house: one on the back of the
   toilet, one in the grimy bathtub, at least two in my kids’ bathroom.
   One reporter joked along with me, and then my eyes dropped down as I
   remembered the feeling of kneeling in front of a stranger’s toilet, and
   I said, “I could never ask someone to do that job.”

  The Most Dangerous Way to Lose Yourself

     * James Hamblin

   “Identity fusion” might explain why people act against their own
   interests.

   When John F. Kennedy was 17, he was part of a prank club. At
   Connecticut’s elite Choate school in 1935, word spread that the group
   was planning to pile horse manure in the gymnasium. Before this “prank”
   could happen, the school’s headmaster confronted the troublesome boys.
   The scheme was the culmination of a list of offenses at the school, and
   young Kennedy was expelled.

   Though the sentence was eventually reduced to probation, the headmaster
   suggested that Kennedy see a “gland specialist” to help him “overcome
   this strange childishness.” The doctor Kennedy ended up seeing was
   Prescott Lecky, a young, mutton-chopped psychologist. Lecky had made a
   name for himself at Columbia University as a skeptic of psychoanalytic
   theory, running up against Carl Jung and the Viennese establishment’s
   approach at the time. Instead of tracing Kennedy’s rebellious instincts
   to repressed motives or early-life stress, Lecky interrogated the boy’s
   sense of self.

  We Spent 10 Months Investigating Kavanaugh. Here’s What We Found.

     * Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin

   Two journalists detail the results of their reporting on the Supreme
   Court justice’s past.

   Years ago, when she was practicing her closing arguments at the family
   dinner table, Martha Kavanaugh often returned to her signature line as
   a state prosecutor. “Use your common sense,” she’d say. “What rings
   true? What rings false?”

   Those words made a strong impression on her young son, Brett. They also
   made a strong impression on us, as we embarked on our 10-month
   investigation of the Supreme Court justice. We conducted hundreds of
   interviews with principal players in Kavanaugh’s education, career, and
   confirmation. We read thousands of documents. We reviewed hours of
   television interviews, along with reams of newspaper, magazine, and
   digital coverage. We studied maps of Montgomery Country, Maryland, as
   well as housing-renovation plans and court records. We watched
   Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings multiple times.

  Trump Is Not Well

     * Peter Wehner

   Accepting the reality about the president’s disordered personality is
   important—even essential.

   During the 2016 campaign, I received a phone call from an influential
   political journalist and author, who was soliciting my thoughts on
   Donald Trump. Trump’s rise in the Republican Party was still something
   of a shock, and he wanted to know the things I felt he should keep in
   mind as he went about the task of covering Trump.

   At the top of my list: Talk to psychologists and psychiatrists about
   the state of Trump’s mental health, since I considered that to be the
   most important thing when it came to understanding him. It was Trump’s
   Rosetta stone.

   I wasn’t shy about making the same case publicly. During a July 14,
   2016, appearance on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, for example, I
   responded to a pro-Trump caller who was upset that I opposed Trump
   despite my having been a Republican for my entire adult life and having
   served in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations and the
   George W. Bush White House.

  The Oceans We Know Won’t Survive Climate Change

     * Robinson Meyer

   Sea-level rise will become unmanageable, and life will flee the world’s
   tropical oceans, if carbon pollution keeps rising, a new report from
   the UN climate panel says.

   Today a baby girl was born. Consider the years of her life—how she’ll
   think back to her childhood in the ’20s (the 2020s) and become a
   teenager in the ’30s. If she’s an American citizen, she’ll cast her
   first vote for president in the 2040 election; she might graduate from
   college a year or two later. In the year 2050, she’ll turn 31, and
   she’ll be both fully grown up and young enough to look to the end of
   the century—and imagine she may get to see it.

   We hold the fate of that girl—and of the society she inhabits—in our
   hands. That’s the message of a blockbuster new report, released today,
   from the United Nations–led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC).

   While the report covers how climate change is reshaping the oceans and
   ice sheets, its deeper focus is how water, in all its forms, is closely
   tied to human flourishing. If our water-related problems are relatively
   easy to manage, then the problem of self-government is also easier. But
   if we keep spewing carbon pollution into the air, then the resulting
   planetary upheaval would constitute “a major strike against the human
   endeavor,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a lead author of the report and a
   professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton.

  Why Greta Makes Adults Uncomfortable

     * Robinson Meyer

   Especially in private, she sounds a lot like … a teenager.

   In a very short time, Greta Thunberg—with her searing stare, Pippi
   Longstocking braids, and hand-painted sign reading SKOLSTREJK FÖR
   KLIMATET—has become a global icon. A year ago, the 16-year-old Swedish
   climate activist began striking from school each Friday to protest
   climate inaction; last Friday, she gave a speech to hundreds of
   thousands of people in New York, at the Global Climate Strike, which
   was inspired by her protest.

   It is always at least a little unfortunate to see a young person become
   an icon—it robs them of the privacy of growing up. But Thunberg is an
   especially flummoxing figure. She looks younger than her years, yet her
   speeches take a shaming, authoritative tone that is, at the very least,
   unusual for a child. “How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my
   childhood,” she told world leaders at the United Nations today. She has
   also said that money and eternal economic growth are “fairy tales.” So
   she has inspired both public adoration and malign theorizing (mostly
   centered around the power of her parents).

  Why Are American Homes So Big?

     * Joe Pinsker

   The U.S. is in the top tier of house sizes internationally—and it’s not
   just because of McMansions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   America is a place defined by bigness. It is infamous, both within its
   borders and abroad, for the size of its cars, its portions, its defense
   budget—and its houses.

   Rightly so: U.S. houses are among the biggest—if not the biggest—in the
   world. According to the real-estate firms Zillow and Redfin, the median
   size of an American single-family home is in the neighborhood of 1,600
   or 1,650 square feet. About five years ago, Sonia A. Hirt, a professor
   of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia,
   was working on a book about land-use patterns in the U.S., and when she
   tracked down the average size of dwellings for about two dozen
   countries, the U.S. came out on top. Her comparisons were rough because
   she’d cobbled together her data from various sources, but she found
   that American living spaces had a good 600 to 800 square feet on most
   of the competition.

  What Pelosi’s Pivot on Impeachment Really Means

     * Russell Berman and Elaine Godfrey

   Is this a defining moment in the Trump presidency, or merely some
   creative packaging?

   When Speaker Nancy Pelosi solemnly announced that the House of
   Representatives would open an impeachment inquiry against President
   Donald Trump shortly after 5 p.m. on Tuesday, everything changed. Or
   maybe nothing changed at all.

   On the one hand, the most powerful woman in America had just
   unequivocally thrown her support behind an official effort to remove
   the president from office, abandoning her long-standing opposition to
   such a drastic move. On the other, Pelosi had merely offered her
   endorsement of a process—an investigation to determine whether to
   recommend articles of impeachment—that was already under way in the
   House.

   Pelosi announced no new select committee to handle Trump’s impeachment.
   She provided no timetable for its consideration. She gave no guarantee
   that the House would even vote to charge the president, much less adopt
   articles that would prompt a trial in the Senate.

  My Husband Paid Me to Do Housework

     * Sophie Knight

   We wanted to address a systemic, gendered imbalance. It didn’t really
   work.

   A couple of years ago, I started invoicing my husband for housework. It
   made sense to us: While our goal was to divide the work equally, I
   ended up doing much more because he worked in an office and I worked at
   home as a freelancer, using my breaks to cook, vacuum, and do laundry.

   We split all our bills down the middle, except for rent, which we each
   paid in proportion to our income. But if we felt financially even, we
   didn’t when it came to time. It seemed unfair that I was doing most of
   the housework, even if I found it easy to fit into my day and was more
   proficient at it. So we came up with a system: He would pay me for
   every hour of housework I did more than him. We set my rate at €11.50
   (about $13, at the time) an hour—the price of a cleaner where we lived,
   in the Netherlands. This seemed like a way to ease my resentment, to
   make our chore imbalance visible, and (I hoped) to incentivize him to
   take on more tasks.

               Leaving the Paris Agreement Would Be Indefensible

   I was Obama’s chief climate negotiator. Whether to stay in the
   agreement is not a close call.

   Reports suggest that President Trump has finally decided to pull out of
   the 2015 Paris climate agreement after many weeks of a back and forth
   administration tug-of-war. Trump himself has tweeted that he will make
   an official announcement in the coming days. I have followed the ups
   and downs of this debate more closely than most, and weighed in where I
   could, because, as the U.S. special envoy for climate change, I led the
   U.S. negotiating effort from the start of the Obama administration
   through and beyond the Paris talks. Along with many others, I have
   tried to defend and preserve the U.S. role in Paris not because of the
   personal blood, sweat, and tears that my team and I invested (well,
   mostly not), but because we understand the climate threat, we recognize
   what’s at stake, and we know the giant step forward that the Paris
   Agreement represented.

   The president evidently intends to follow his own misguided calculus. A
   decision to withdraw would be indefensible. It is important to
   understand why and to consider what we need to do next.

   The administration’s withdrawal caucus has argued that the Paris
   Agreement is a bad deal for the United States, but they don’t have even
   a passing knowledge of the facts. The truth is, Paris was a landmark
   achievement, establishing a durable global climate regime for the first
   time since the original “framework convention” was agreed to in 1992.

   The Paris Agreement is ambitious, universal transparent, and balanced.
   It brings China, India, and other developing countries fully into the
   regime. It combines strong, aggregate goals with a “bottom-up”
   structure in which countries decide their emissions targets for
   themselves and then continually update those targets on five-year
   cycles. Yet Paris boxes no one in; all are urged to aim high, but
   targets are not legally binding. It succeeded with strong U.S.
   leadership every step of the way. The entire world has signed on, save
   only Syria and Nicaragua. It appears that the president now means to
   expand that group of two to include the United States of America.

   Pulling out of Paris would cause serious diplomatic damage. The
   countries of the world care about climate change. They see it as a
   profound threat. They recognize there is no way to meet that global
   threat without an effective global regime. And they understand that the
   Paris regime cannot work in the long run if the world’s indispensable
   power has left the table. The president’s exit from Paris would be read
   as a kind of “drop dead” to the rest of the world. Bitterness, anger,
   and disgust would be the wages of this careless act. As Ronald Reagan’s
   secretary of state, George Shultz, said recently about Paris, “[g]lobal
   statecraft relies on trust, reputation and credibility, which can be
   all too easily squandered. …[I]f America fails to honor a global
   agreement that it helped forge, the repercussions will undercut our
   diplomatic priorities across the globe.”

   What is perhaps most astonishing about the possibility of withdrawal,
   given Trump’s business background, is that such a decision would fly in
   the face of nearly across-the-board support for Paris among top
   American companies, in sectors ranging from oil and gas to retail,
   chemicals, utilities, agriculture, finance, information, and autos.
   Business leaders know climate change is real. They know Paris is an
   agreement they can work with. They know having U.S. negotiators at the
   table to protect their interests on matters like intellectual property
   and trade is crucial. They know that the transition to clean energy is
   one of the biggest economic plays of this century, that climate change
   is a major driver of this transition, that the United States is
   perfectly positioned to lead with our unmatched culture of innovation,
   but that opting out of Paris will undermine this opportunity to expand
   markets, create jobs and build wealth.

   Against these potent reasons to stay in the Paris Agreement, the
   withdrawal crowd has offered up bogus legal arguments that
   misunderstand the agreement, but they are just excuses. The real reason
   for their opposition is that they reject the importance of containing
   climate change in the first place. Remember OMB Director Mike
   Mulvaney’s words: “we're not spending money on [climate change]
   anymore; we consider that to be a waste.”

   But we are far past the point when we should be discussing whether
   climate change is a live risk. The Pentagon calls it a “threat
   multiplier” in vulnerable regions of the world. The National
   Intelligence Council says climate change “will almost certainly have
   significant effects, both direct and indirect, across social, economic,
   political, and security realms during the next 20 years.” Firms like
   BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Shell, among others, have
   produced serious climate reports focused on the transition needed to
   meet the goals of Paris. And just look at the signals from nature, at
   the dozens of “100-year” events—floods, superstorms, droughts,
   wildfires, record heat waves—taking place in the United States and
   around the world in recent years. Weather-related losses have tripled
   since the 1980s.

   In short, whether to stay in the Paris regime is not a close call.  It
   is not hard.  There is no significant outside constituency arguing for
   America to leave. There is a massive outside constituency—world
   leaders, Fortune 100 CEOS, civil society—urging us to stay, even if the
   price for Trump staying is a downward adjustment of our target. The
   Trump team now appears to be getting it wrong. Where are the determined
   internal voices for getting this right? Where is the vaunted national
   security team to protect our standing, our reputation, our honor? Where
   are the grownups to channel the near-consensus of American business and
   prevent this train-wreck of a decision?

   But we have to confront the likelihood that this happening. So, what do
   we do then?

   What we don’t do is wring our hands or lose hope. All over the United
   States and all over the world we must resolve to defeat the Trump
   administration in its effort to toss climate change overboard.

   Around the world, I believe countries will stay in the Paris climate
   agreement and work to build it into a regime that will enable us to
   meet the climate challenge. They need to elaborate follow-on
   guidelines, rules and procedures in a manner faithful to the essential
   balance of the accord. And, with others, I will encourage them to do
   this in a manner that will pave the way for re-entry by an enlightened
   American administration in the years ahead.

   In the United States, the already strong efforts of our states and
   cities will loom even larger, demonstrating to ourselves and the world
   our commitment to confront climate change. States from California,
   Washington, and Oregon to Minnesota, Illinois, New York, New England,
   and many others are dedicated to strong climate action and will examine
   whether there is still more that they can do. Many more states, both
   red and blue, are charging ahead in developing wind and solar energy.

   The dozen U.S. cities that are part of the global C-40 group on climate
   change account for 25 percent of U.S. population and 30 percent of U.S.
   GDP. In Mexico City last December, led by Mike Bloomberg, they promised
   to deliver action, regardless of what the new Trump administration
   decided to do. These and dozens of other committed U.S. cities have a
   more important role to play than ever.

   It would also be valuable and impactful for engaged U.S. states and
   cities to work with the UNFCCC, the parent body for the Paris regime,
   so that a platform is provided to these pivotal U.S. players to convey
   to the global community a message of engagement, commitment and
   accomplishment back home. The message needs to come through that, while
   the Trump administration may have checked out on climate change,
   America has not.

   Business also has a crucial role to play in driving the clean energy
   transformation. The boom is well under way. Wind and solar accounted
   for two-thirds of all new electric capacity in the United States in
   2016. Costs of wind and solar have dropped over 80 percent in the past
   eight years for solar PV and over 60 percent for wind. And hi-tech
   advances are happening all the time, in battery storage, materials
   science, electric vehicles, and other key elements of the transition.
   It would be a mistake for companies to bet on a go-slow, “Trump” phase.
   The Trump administration’s actions at home and abroad are problematic
   to be sure, but no one can hold back the tides. The transition to clean
   energy is the right side of history, and the smart bet for businesses
   and investors is to keep their eyes on the prize and not get distracted
   by the ideological wars of Washington.

   Finally, civil society, from students to citizens of all ages, already
   active across the country, needs to ramp up even more, to stay engaged
   or get engaged, and make clear to politicians at every level that
   rejecting strong climate action will cost them on election day.

   The Trump administration is about to throw down the gauntlet. If it
   does, we’ll need to take up the challenge.

                      How Do Aliens Solve Climate Change?

   Scientists recently modeled a range of interactions between
   energy-intensive civilizations and their planets. The results were
   sobering.

   The universe does many things. It makes galaxies, comets, black holes,
   neutron stars, and a whole mess more. We’ve lately discovered that it
   makes a great deal of planets, but it’s not clear whether it regularly
   makes energy-hungry civilizations, nor is it clear whether such
   civilizations inevitably drive their planets into climate change.
   There’s lots of hope riding on our talk about building a sustainable
   civilization on Earth. But how do we know that’s even possible? Does
   anyone across the cosmos ever make it?

   Remarkably, science has now advanced to point where we can take a first
   step at answering this question. I know this because my colleagues and
   I have just published a first study mapping out possible histories of
   alien planets, the civilizations they grow, and the climate change that
   follows. Our team was made up of astronomers, an earth scientist, and
   an urban ecologist.

   It was only half-jokingly that we thought of our study as a
   “theoretical archaeology of exo-civilizations.” “Exo-civilizations” are
   what people really mean when they talk about aliens. Astronomers refer
   to the new worlds they’ve discovered as “exoplanets.” They’re now
   gearing up to use the James Webb Space Telescope and other instruments
   to search for life by looking for signs of “exo-biospheres” on those
   exoplanets. So if we have exoplanets and exo-biospheres, it’s time to
   switch out the snicker-inducing word “aliens” for the real focus of our
   concerns: exo-civilizations.

   We’re interested in how exo-civilizations develop on their planets.
   Given that more than 10 billion trillion planets likely exist in the
   cosmos, unless nature is perversely biased against civilizations like
   ours, we’re not the first one to appear. That means each
   exo-civilization that evolved from its planet’s biosphere had a
   history: a story of emergence, rising capacities, and then maybe a slow
   fade or rapid collapse. And just as most species that have ever lived
   on Earth are now extinct, so too most civilizations that emerged (if
   they emerged) may have long since ended. So we’re exploring what may
   have happened to others to gain insights into what might happen to us.

   Of course, we have no direct evidence relating to any exo-civilizations
   or their histories. What we do have, however, are the laws of planets.
   Our robot emissaries have already visited most of the worlds in the
   solar system. We’ve set up weather stations on Mars, watched the
   runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, and seen rain cascade across
   methane lakes on Titan. From these worlds we learned the generic
   physics and chemistry that make up what’s called climate. We can use
   these laws to predict the global response of any planet to something
   like an asteroid impact or perhaps the emergence of an energy-hungry
   industrial civilization.

   To launch our science of exo-civilizations we started with those laws
   of planets, building the right equations to capture the intertwined
   evolution of a planet and its young civilization. But planetary laws of
   physics and chemistry only tell part of the story. If we want to know
   the possible fates of other civilizations on other worlds, we had to
   bring some biology to bear too.

   Science fiction has given us enduring images of alien races. Not
   surprisingly, most of them look a lot like us but with different kinds
   of foreheads or ears, or a different number of fingers on their hands.
   In developing our first cut at a science of exo-civilizations, my
   collaborators and I weren’t interested in what aliens might look like
   or what kind of sex they have. To do our job we had to avoid the
   specifics of both their individual biology and their sociology because
   science provides us little to work with on those fronts. There was,
   however, one place where biology was up to the task.

   Population biology was a radical new field back in the early 20th
   century. Rather than just collecting statistics to describe animal
   populations, a few ambitious researchers like Alfred Lotka wanted to
   create basic mathematical models of things like predators and prey to
   predict the evolution of their linked populations. Predators (like
   wolves) eat prey (like bunnies) so they can make more wolf babies,
   thereby increasing the wolf population. Bunnies do a fine job of
   reproducing on their own, but if too many are eaten, their population
   numbers suffer. Today, population biologists, ecologists, and their
   compatriots use mathematical models to study everything from the spread
   of disease to the propagation of invasive species. The approach has
   even found its way to the study of human civilizations, including their
   collapse in places like Easter Island.

   We used these tools to build a simple model for the evolution of a
   civilization with its planet. In our approach, the exo-civilization’s
   population and the planetary environment are braided together by energy
   use and its consequences. The planet gives the civilization energy
   resources. The civilization consumes them to do the work of
   civilization building. As a civilization harvests more power from the
   planet, its capacities soar. That includes the ability to make and feed
   more babies. This link between available energy (in the form of food
   for simple organisms) and rising birth rates is fundamental to
   population biology. And for human civilization the steep rise we’ve
   seen in population is closely tied to fertilizer involving fossil-fuel
   use. So greater energy will, in the beginning, mean bigger populations.
   But there’s no free lunch from a planetary perspective. Using all that
   energy has to result in feedback on the planet. That’s what we
   earthlings are just starting to see with climate change. If global
   warming gets really nasty, everything from energy harvesting to food
   production is going to get severely stressed and our large human
   population won’t be sustainable. That’s why our exo-civilization models
   linked rising planetary impacts with population declines. It was all
   pretty straightforward, requiring no assumptions about alien economics,
   sociology, or any other science-fiction ideas.

   But to allow for some choice on the part of the exo-civilization we
   also included a basic switch describing how the civilization could
   respond to changing planetary conditions. For the sake of simplicity,
   we imagined that the planet had just two kinds of energy resources. One
   had a high planetary impact (like fossil fuels). The other had low
   impact (like solar energy). In some models we allowed the civilization
   to switch from to one to the other as things got bad.

   So, what did the model tell us? We saw three distinct kinds of
   civilizational histories. The first—and, alarmingly, most common—was
   what we called “the die-off.” As the civilization used energy, its
   numbers grew rapidly, but the use of the resource also pushed the
   planet away from the conditions the civilization grew up with. As the
   evolution of the civilization and planet continued, the population
   skyrocketed, blowing past the planet’s limits. The population, in other
   words, overshot the planet’s carrying capacity. Then came a big
   reduction in the civilization’s population until both the planet and
   the civilization reached a steady state. After that the population and
   the planet stopped changing. A sustainable planetary civilization was
   achieved, but at a high cost. In many of the models, we saw as much as
   70 percent of the population perish before a steady state was reached.
   In reality, it’s not clear that a complex technological civilization
   like ours could survive such a catastrophe.

   In many ways we were seeing a kind of cosmic Easter Island play out.
   There may have been as many as 10,000 people living on Easter Island at
   the peak of its stone-head-making heyday. But by cutting down all the
   trees to roll the stone heads around, that civilization seems to have
   mucked up its ecosystem and sealed its own fate. When the Dutch arrived
   in 1722 only a few thousand folks, living greatly reduced lives, were
   left.

   The second kind of trajectory held the good news. We called it the
   “soft landing.” The population grew and the planet changed but together
   they made a smooth transition to new, balanced equilibrium. The
   civilization had changed the planet but without triggering a massive
   die-off.

   The final class of trajectory was the most worrisome: full-blown
   collapse. As in the die-off histories, the population blew up. But
   these planets just couldn’t handle the avalanche of the civilization’s
   impact. The host worlds were too sensitive to change, like a houseplant
   that withers when it’s moved. Conditions on these planets deteriorated
   so fast the civilization’s population nose-dived all the way to
   extinction.

   You might think switching from the high-impact energy source to the
   low-impact source would make things better. But for some trajectories,
   it didn’t matter. If the civilization used only the high-impact
   resource, the population reached a peak and then quickly dropped to
   zero. But if we allowed the civilization to switch to the low-impact
   energy resource, the collapse still happened in certain cases, even if
   it was delayed. The population would start to fall, then happily
   stabilize. But then, finally and suddenly, it rushed downward to
   extinction.

   The collapses that occurred even when the civilization did the smart
   thing demonstrated an essential point about the modeling process.
   Because the equations capture some of the real world’s complexity, they
   can surprise you. In some of the “delayed collapse” histories, the
   planet’s own internal machinery was the culprit. Push a planet too
   hard, and it won’t return to where it began. We know this can happen,
   even without a civilization present, because we see it on Venus. That
   world should be a kind of sister to our own. But long ago Venus’s
   greenhouse effect slipped into a runaway mode, driving its surface
   temperatures to a hellish 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Our models were
   showing, in generic terms, how a civilization could push a planet down
   the hill into a different kind of runaway through its own activity.

   The model we created was, however, just a first stab at a science of
   exo-civilizations. We made the equations a simple as possible while
   still capturing the essence of planet-civilization “coevolution.” That
   means it’s too early to answer the question, “Does anyone make it?”
   Still, our work provides the basic contours of what might happen.

   We need to put in more detailed and realistic climate physics. We also
   need to include the full range of energy sources a young civilization
   might find on its home world—the list is limited by physics:
   combustion, solar, wind, geothermal, tides, nuclear, and a few others.
   Even though our initial models were simple, they still revealed a
   radical truth about the challenge we face as we push the Earth into its
   human-dominated era. Unless the universe is deeply biased against it,
   there have been other civilizations across space and time that faced
   these challenges. Anthropocenes may be common.

   As I explore in my new book, Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the
   Fate of the Earth, our dawning realization that we are profoundly
   shaping Earth’s future provides us with the impetus to stop acting like
   cosmic teenagers with power but little wisdom. From that perspective
   the true narrative of climate change isn’t some small, local drama of
   Democrats vs. Republications or business interests vs.
   environmentalists. Instead, it’s a cosmic test, one that gives us a
   chance to join those who successfully crossed this burning frontier—or
   the chance to be consigned to the scrap heap of civilizations too
   shortsighted to take care of their own planet.

                  Why It Was Easier to Be Skinny in the 1980s

   A new study finds that people today who eat and exercise the same
   amount as people 20 years ago are still fatter.


    Olga Khazan

   Sep 30, 2015

   Reed Saxon / AP

   There’s a meme aimed at Millennial catharsis called “Old Economy
   Steve.” It’s a series of pictures of a late-70s teenager, who
   presumably is now a middle-aged man, that mocks some of the messages
   Millennials say they hear from older generations—and shows why they’re
   deeply janky. Old Economy Steve graduates and gets a job right away.
   Old Economy Steve “worked his way through college” because tuition was
   $400. And so forth.
   Quickmeme

   We can now add another one to that list: Old Economy Steve ate at
   McDonald’s almost every day, and he still somehow had a 32-inch waist.
   MemeGenerator.net

   A study published recently in the journal Obesity Research & Clinical
   Practice found that it’s harder for adults today to maintain the same
   weight as those 20 to 30 years ago did, even at the same levels of food
   intake and exercise.

   The authors examined the dietary data of 36,400 Americans between 1971
   and 2008 and the physical activity data of 14,419 people between 1988
   and 2006. They grouped the data sets together by the amount of food and
   activity, age, and BMI.

   They found a very surprising correlation: A given person, in 2006,
   eating the same amount of calories, taking in the same quantities of
   macronutrients like protein and fat, and exercising the same amount as
   a person of the same age did in 1988 would have a BMI that was about
   2.3 points higher. In other words, people today are about 10 percent
   heavier than people were in the 1980s, even if they follow the exact
   same diet and exercise plans.

   “Our study results suggest that if you are 25, you’d have to eat even
   less and exercise more than those older, to prevent gaining weight,”
   Jennifer Kuk, a professor of kinesiology and health science at
   Toronto’s York University, said in a statement. “However, it also
   indicates there may be other specific changes contributing to the rise
   in obesity beyond just diet and exercise.”

   Just what those other changes might be, though, are still a matter of
   hypothesis. In an interview, Kuk proffered three different factors that
   might be making harder for adults today to stay thin.

   First, people are exposed to more chemicals that might be weight-gain
   inducing. Pesticides, flame retardants, and the substances in food
   packaging might all be altering our hormonal processes and tweaking the
   way our bodies put on and maintain weight.

   Second, the use of prescription drugs has risen dramatically since the
   ‘70s and ‘80s. Prozac, the first blockbuster SSRI, came out in 1988.
   Antidepressants are now one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in
   the U.S., and many of them have been linked to weight gain.

   Finally, Kuk and the other study authors think that the microbiomes of
   Americans might have somehow changed between the 1980s and now. It’s
   well known that some types of gut bacteria make a person more prone to
   weight gain and obesity. Americans are eating more meat than they were
   a few decades ago, and many animal products are treated with hormones
   and antibiotics in order to promote growth. All that meat might be
   changing gut bacteria in ways that are subtle, at first, but add up
   over time. Kuk believes the proliferation of artificial sweeteners
   could also be playing a role.

   The fact that the body weights of Americans today are influenced by
   factors beyond their control is a sign, Kuk says, that society should
   be kinder to people of all body types.

   “There's a huge weight bias against people with obesity,” she said.
   “They're judged as lazy and self-indulgent. That's really not the case.
   If our research is correct, you need to eat even less and exercise even
   more” just to be same weight as your parents were at your age.

   The exercise part is perhaps one area where Old Economy Steve doesn’t
   have an edge. A membership at one of the newfangled fitness centers of
   1987 would go for about $2,800 per year in today’s dollars, and that’s
   still what it costs today.

                          Always Have Three Beverages

   The correct number of drinks to keep at your desk

   The phrase rule of three is a Rorschach test. When people hear it, it
   can conjure an array of disparate guidelines. Celebrity deaths.
   Rhetorical technique. Aesthetic pleasure. Free markets. Joke writing.
   There are so many rules of three across disciplines and superstitions
   that the concept requires its own disambiguation page on Wikipedia,
   which lists 17 different options.

   Some of those rules are more important than others. Pilots have one for
   landing airplanes that advises descending 1,000 feet every three miles
   to ensure that the plane doesn’t drop too quickly for passengers to
   adjust to changing cabin pressure. Outdoors-people use one as a guide
   for how long people can usually stay alive in extreme conditions: three
   minutes without oxygen, three hours without shelter, three days without
   water, and three weeks without food. More broadly, groupings of three
   pop up everywhere: the Holy Trinity, the three branches of the U.S.
   government, the number of data points required to determine an unknown
   location, the number of partners needed to corner people at a party to
   talk about polyamory.

   Relatively little is known about why people enjoy and invoke triads so
   frequently. But after more than a decade of personal research, I’d like
   to present a new rule of three for your consideration: If you work at a
   desk in an office, three desk beverages is the ideal number to keep by
   your side. The first is water. The second is a source of caffeine. The
   third is something fun—a juice, a soda, a glass of wine on Friday
   afternoon (if your office is like that), a kombucha (if you are like
   that).

   The case for having any beverages at your desk in the first place is
   one of basic human biology. Your mom was right when she told you to
   drink some water: Mild dehydration isn’t a notable health risk, but the
   spotty research done on the topic suggests that being thirsty is
   distracting. Slaking that thirst might help you return to your
   spreadsheets and get out of the office on time. Even if you’re not
   thirsty, people tend to report feeling more alert after having some
   water. Water is the foundation of your beverage kingdom.

   And then there’s caffeine. Research has shown that it improves
   alertness in moderately sleepy people—for instance, those who
   underestimated the size of their sandwich and are now slowly slipping
   into a food coma at their desk. Maybe you stayed a little too long at
   happy hour last night and need a coffee to help ease your headache. Or
   maybe you’ve just been riding around on the planet with the rest of us
   for long enough that you need a Diet Coke on a spiritual level. Add it
   to the lineup.

   Completing the desk-bev triumvirate is where the magic happens. A third
   beverage is your wild card, a chance for a little bit of random
   pleasure in a period of the day that is otherwise not your own. One of
   the reasons people go so wild for random snacks in the workplace is
   that popcorn or cookies allow a moment of disengagement from work that
   feels autonomous. Since water and coffee are the only drinks many
   workplaces provide, tracking down a third can be an excuse to leave the
   office for a moment, even if it’s just to run to the nearby corner
   store. Small, regular pleasures have real psychological value in any
   part of life. During the workday, acquiring a mango seltzer or green
   juice can return some humanity to the cubicle farm.

   It probably isn’t a coincidence that three is my personal sweet spot,
   according to Kurt Carlson, a marketing researcher at the College of
   William & Mary’s Raymond A. Mason School of Business. As far as I can
   tell, he’s the only person who has done significant research into why
   and how human brains sort things into groupings of three. “People
   believe they’re observing something special when they see the third
   instance of it happen,” he explains. “After making three shots in a
   row, the person’s hot, and four doesn’t make them more hot. If you miss
   three traffic lights in a row, the world’s out to get you.”

   Carlson references shots because he began his research by looking at
   data from the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team. He found that when
   players make or miss three shots in a row, both they and their
   competitors believe that they are on a streak, which actually changes
   the probability of a player making or missing the next shot. If a guy
   is hot, he is “going to take shots that he shouldn’t take, the defense
   is going to double-team him, his teammates are going to force him the
   ball in places they shouldn’t have forced him the ball,” Carlson
   explains. Counterintuitively, that makes a player with “hot hands” less
   likely to make a fourth shot than under baseline circumstances. The
   inverse also happens for players who miss three: Everyone takes that as
   a sign that a player is no longer a threat, and the player’s chances of
   sinking a shot end up improving.

   When it comes time to make decisions or process new information, people
   often default to problem-solving shortcuts called heuristics, many of
   which are so ingrained in human thinking that it might feel like you
   were born with them. Carlson believes that groupings of three spring
   out of our brains’ efforts to be simultaneously organized and complete.
   “The least cognitively challenging way to categorize things is to put
   them into two buckets, and the hardest way is to treat everything as an
   individual,” he says. The middle-ground approach to distinguishing
   between concepts without driving ourselves mad with nuance is to put
   things into three categories. In that sense, at least, the theory of
   hydration, caffeine, and pleasure is time-tested and psychologically
   approved.

   Unfortunately, academia stands in the way of testing my desk-bev theory
   any further. “That is as far as I got,” Carlson says. “I moved on. You
   can only publish so many things that are cutesy like that before you
   damage your reputation as a real scholar.”
