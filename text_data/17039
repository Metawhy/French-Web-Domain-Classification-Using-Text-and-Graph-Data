shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities, in pa
rticular as regards their duties in connection with the exercising of the rights
 of the Data Subject, by means of an arrangement between them. The arrangement m
ay designate a contact point for Data Subject. The arrangement shall duly reflec
t the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-à-vis the
Data Subject. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to the Data
 Subject. Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement, the Data Subject may exe
rcise his or her rights in respect of and against each of the data controllers.


Rights of Data Subjects
The Data Subject may request information from the responsible administrator of t
he Data Controller about the processing of his or her personal data, such as his
 or her data managed by the Data Controller or processed by the Processor mandat
ed by the Data Controller, the purpose, legal basis, duration of the data proces
sing, activity of the Processor contiguous to data management, and who and for w
hat purpose are receiving or have received the data. The Data Controller shall p
rovide the requested information free of charge as soon as possible after the su
bmission of the request, but at the latest within 30 days in writing, in a clear
ly understandable form.
In the event of refusal to give information, the Data Controller shall inform th
e Data Subject in writing under which provision of Infotv. the refusal is made.
In the event of denial of information, the Data Controller shall inform the Data
 Subject about the possibility applying for a judicial remedy and to the Nationa
l Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (hereinafter referred
 to as the ‘Authority’).
In the event of a data change or incorrect recording of data, the Data Subject m
ay request rectification of his or her processed data. Wrong data must be rectif
ied by the Data Controller within 15 working days.
Except for statutory data processing, the Data Subject may request the erasure o
f his or her processed data without reasoning. The erasure must be completed imm
ediately. The Data Controller may block personal data instead of erasing if so r
equested by the Data Subject, or if based on the information available it can be
 assumed that erasure could affect the legitimate interests of the Data Subject.
Personal data blocked this way can only be processed as long as the purpose of d
ata processing which prevented their erasure persists.

In the event of violation of his or her rights with regard to data processing, t
he Data Subject shall be able to lodge a complaint to the head of the relevant d
epartment or the Data Controller’s executive director. In case of doubt, the Dat
a Controller’s executive director shall decide within the shortest possible time
, but not later than 15 days after the submission of the complaint. If the Data
Subject does not consider the decision to be satisfactory or thinks that his or
her rights have been prejudiced with regard to the processing of his or her pers
onal data, the Data Subject may contact the court within 30 days of the decision
 date or the last day of the deadline.
If according to the findings of the Data Controller, the Data Subject’s objectio
n is justified, it shall terminate all data processing operations, including dat
a collection and transfer, shall erase the data and notify all those to whom any
 of these personal data had previously been transferred about the objection and
the ensuing measures, upon which these recipients shall take measures regarding
the enforcement of the objection.
The Data Controller shall not delete the data of the data subject if data proces
sing has been prescribed by law. However, the personal data may not be transferr
ed to the data recipient if the Data Controller agrees with the objection or if
the court has found the objection justified. The Data Controller shall be liable
 for any damage caused to the Data Subject as a result of unlawful processing or
 by any breach of data security requirements. The Data Subject shall be liable f
or damage caused to the Data Controller by the Data Processor as well. The Data
Controller shall be exempted from liability if it can prove that the damage was
a result of obstacles outside the scope of data processing. No compensation shal
l be paid where the damage was a result of deliberate or grossly negligent condu
ct of the Data Subject or the injured party.

Where processing is based on consent, the Data Controller shall be able to demon
strate that the Data Subject has consented to the processing of his or her perso
nal data. If the Data Subject's consent is given in the context of a written dec
laration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be pre
sented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in a
n intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. The D
ata Subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The
 withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on co
nsent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the Data Subject shall be
informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of
 whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of
services, is conditional on consent to the processing of such personal data that
 are not necessary for the performance of that contract.

ay request rectification of his or her processed data. Wrong data must be rectif
ied by the Data Controller within 15 working days.
Except for statutory data processing, the Data Subject may request the erasure o
f his or her processed data without reasoning. The erasure must be completed imm
ediately. The Data Controller may block personal data instead of erasing if so r
equested by the Data Subject, or if based on the information available it can be
 assumed that erasure could affect the legitimate interests of the Data Subject.
Personal data blocked this way can only be processed as long as the purpose of d
ata processing which prevented their erasure persists.

In the event of violation of his or her rights with regard to data processing, t
he Data Subject shall be able to lodge a complaint to the head of the relevant d
epartment or the Data Controller’s executive director. In case of doubt, the Dat
a Controller’s executive director shall decide within the shortest possible time
, but not later than 15 days after the submission of the complaint. If the Data
Subject does not consider the decision to be satisfactory or thinks that his or
her rights have been prejudiced with regard to the processing of his or her pers
onal data, the Data Subject may contact the court within 30 days of the decision
 date or the last day of the deadline.
If according to the findings of the Data Controller, the Data Subject’s objectio
n is justified, it shall terminate all data processing operations, including dat
a collection and transfer, shall erase the data and notify all those to whom any
 of these personal data had previously been transferred about the objection and
the ensuing measures, upon which these recipients shall take measures regarding
the enforcement of the objection.
The Data Controller shall not delete the data of the data subject if data proces
sing has been prescribed by law. However, the personal data may not be transferr
ed to the data recipient if the Data Controller agrees with the objection or if
the court has found the objection justified. The Data Controller shall be liable
 for any damage caused to the Data Subject as a result of unlawful processing or
 by any breach of data security requirements. The Data Subject shall be liable f
or damage caused to the Data Controller by the Data Processor as well. The Data
Controller shall be exempted from liability if it can prove that the damage was
a result of obstacles outside the scope of data processing. No compensation shal
l be paid where the damage was a result of deliberate or grossly negligent condu
ct of the Data Subject or the injured party.

Where processing is based on consent, the Data Controller shall be able to demon
strate that the Data Subject has consented to the processing of his or her perso
nal data. If the Data Subject's consent is given in the context of a written dec
laration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be pre
sented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in a
n intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. The D
ata Subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The
 withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on co
nsent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the Data Subject shall be
informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of
 whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of
services, is conditional on consent to the processing of such personal data that
 are not necessary for the performance of that contract.

ler’), taking into account the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Eur
opean Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with re
gard to the processing of personal data (hereinafter referred to as the ‘GDPR’),
 the Fundamental Law of Hungary and Act CXII of 2011 on the right of information
al self-determination and on freedom of information (hereinafter referred to as
‘Infotv.’ (the above mentioned legal provisions jointly referred to as the ‘Legi
slation’), as a result of this I set out the rules for the management and proces
sing of personal data carried out by the organisational units of the Company in
this Privacy Policy (hereafter referred to as the ‘Policy’).

General Provisions
The Purpose and Scope of the Policy


The purpose of the Policy is to determine the rights and obligations of the Data
 Controller and the Data Subject in the management and processing of the persona
l data of Data Subjects and the management of irregularities, and thereby to ens
ure that the requirements laid down in the Legislation are enforced. The Data Co

t or by a clear affirmative action (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Statement’),

nsent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the Data Subject shall be

       WHY BUDAPEST?

       5 Reasons You Need To Visit Budapest

       1. It’s one of the most historic cities on the planet.
       Budapest is right on the Danube, which has been home to humans
       since the Stone Age. The river and its Buda Castle are UNESCO World
       Heritage sites. Book a nighttime cruise to see them in top form.

       2. It’s a food capital, and for good reason.
       Budapest’s food history spans literal centuries. Check out amazing
       farmers markets of fruits, veggies and pastries.

       3. Hot springs make the city into a spa playground.
       Hungary is said to have more than 1,000 hot springs thanks to
       super-thin earth crust. Take a break at one of Budapest’s
       hot-spring spas like Széchenyi thermal baths, where outdoor pool
       temps reach about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

       4. And here, wine is an art form.
       Hungary is famous for its vineyards. Weave deep into a cave
       labyrinth under Budapest’s castle district for a wine tasting
       you’ll never forget.

       5. You’ll party in “ruins.”
       Ruin pubs are doomed buildings — old cinemas, car parks and
       apartment buildings — that have been turned into the cheap bars of
       your dreams. The average bar isn’t too shabby here, either.

rcise his or her rights in respect of and against each of the data controllers.

he Data Controller about the processing of his or her personal data, such as his
 or her data managed by the Data Controller or processed by the Processor mandat

f his or her processed data without reasoning. The erasure must be completed imm
ediately. The Data Controller may block personal data instead of erasing if so r
equested by the Data Subject, or if based on the information available it can be
 assumed that erasure could affect the legitimate interests of the Data Subject.

ata processing which prevented their erasure persists.

he Data Subject shall be able to lodge a complaint to the head of the relevant d
epartment or the Data Controller’s executive director. In case of doubt, the Dat

the ensuing measures, upon which these recipients shall take measures regarding
the enforcement of the objection.

sing has been prescribed by law. However, the personal data may not be transferr
ed to the data recipient if the Data Controller agrees with the objection or if
the court has found the objection justified. The Data Controller shall be liable
 for any damage caused to the Data Subject as a result of unlawful processing or
 by any breach of data security requirements. The Data Subject shall be liable f

l be paid where the damage was a result of deliberate or grossly negligent condu
ct of the Data Subject or the injured party.

strate that the Data Subject has consented to the processing of his or her perso
nal data. If the Data Subject's consent is given in the context of a written dec
laration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be pre
sented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in a
n intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. The D
ata Subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The
 withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on co
nsent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the Data Subject shall be
informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.

 whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of
services, is conditional on consent to the processing of such personal data that
