       Great boards the finish is excellent. I especially like the ice
       cream scoop it is difficult to find one that lasts these days and
       the chefs board looks good enough to eat. Fine workmanship.

       Thanks for stopping by on my blog. The round cutting boards with
       the handle are beautiful (my husband loves working with wood, he
       had an atelier in the garage when we lived in Luxembourg, but
       hasn‚Äôt set it up yet after the move to the UK).
       Enjoy spring!
