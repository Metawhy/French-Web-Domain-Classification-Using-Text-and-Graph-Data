How XM Works

   Experience Management (XM) is how the world’s most successful
   businesses continuously improve the experiences people have with their
   organizations. XM focuses the entire company on delivering value to
   customers and employees, helping drive immediate bottom line results
   and create long-term value for shareholders. Here’s how it works:
    1. Qualtrics makes it easy to collect feedback from customers,
       employees, suppliers, partners, or any other stakeholder using the
       channels they prefer.
    2. Using advanced text and voice analytics, Qualtrics automatically
       surfaces hidden insights buried deep in customer feedback.
    3. With powerful AI and machine learning, Qualtrics generates
       recommended actions, then automatically routes them to the people
       in the best position to affect change.
