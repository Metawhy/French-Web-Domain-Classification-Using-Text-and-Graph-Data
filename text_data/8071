Every Day can be Magix, Can’t it?

   September 16, 2019September 16, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   Well, when it comes to Avon Magix it most certainly can be! Avon has
   just added another new product to their Magix line. The latest one is
   the Magix Wand Foundation Stick! My God this is an amazing gem for
   anyone’s makeup bag.

   Poof! Cover + perfect + blur with the simple wave of our Magix Wand.
   The long-wearing, multi-use foundation stick—and a few sleight-of-hand
   tricks—deliver complexion perfection. The secret? A high-pigment,
   light-as-air formula creates a smooth canvas, perfects tone and blurs
   flaws leaving a soft demi-matte finish.

   Campaign 20 has so much more than just the Avon Magix Wand Foundation
   Stick. The best part is that you can use Magix Prime Face Perfector and
   the Magix Tint Brightening Tinted Moisturizer all together too!

Shop My Avon Store use Welcome10 code. Sorry this is a one time use.

   Side note register online and Avon will send you more specials, some
   that are exclusive to online shoppers and other coupon codes..

   Avon always has so many great gift ideas for the holidays and nobody
   loves the holidays more than Avon! Soon our Christmas Brochures will be
   coming out and I can’t wait. Now is the time to get added on to my
   Email List, Brochure List or Text Message List. I want you to have a
   link for each and every brochure that Avon offers.

   Fundraising, Uncategorized

Are You Looking To Raise Money?

   August 4, 2019August 13, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   Avon Fundraising can be fun and easy! You can raise money for anything!
   Everybody has a different reasons for wanting a fundraiser. I am here
   to help you get started with yours today.

Why Avon Fundraising

     * The Avon name is known worldwide. We have been a Fortune 500
       company since the inception of the Fortune 500.  We are one of the
       most popular direct selling companies in the world.
     * There is no investment on your part- we supply the materials you
       need.
     * We have one of the highest fundraising percentage rates so you can
       reach your goal faster.

   Raising funds can be a hard task to complete especially if you are
   needing funds for time sensitive things like putting a new roof on your
   local church, needing to pay medical bills for a long term illness or
   even paying for students to go on an expensive field trip. With an Avon
   fundraiser, as you will see, hard is taken out of the equation.

Some of the Benefits

     * Products every family needs, and already uses
     * Simple, easy to use sales flyers
     * Earnings in hand in as little as 3 weeks after closing of
       fundraiser.
     * Support from a trained Avon Representative
     * No upfront purchases required
     * The average customer order is more than $15
     * No door-to-door selling. Participants can cell to families,
       neighbors, and friends and still produce a profitable fundraiser.
     * You will have a special link just for your fundraiser.
     * Be provided an exclusive fundraiser event page on Facebook
       for participants & supporters to ask questions, learn more about
       your fundraiser & organization and be able to share on their own
       Facebook profiles and pages.
     * Receive all the materials you will need to have a successful
       fundraiser, including easy to use printed fundraiser flyers, prizes
       for top sellers and flyers you can use to market your fundraiser
       around town.
     * Products every family needs, and already uses
     * Simple, easy to use sales flyers
     * Earnings in hand in as little as 3 weeks after closing of
       fundraiser.
     * Support from a trained Avon Representative
     * No upfront purchases required
     * The average customer order is more than $15
     * No door-to-door selling. Participants can cell to families,
       neighbors, and friends and still produce a profitable fundraiser.
     * You will have a special link just for your fundraiser.
     * Be provided an exclusive fundraiser event page on Facebook
       for participants & supporters to ask questions, learn more about
       your fundraiser & organization and be able to share on their own
       Facebook profiles and pages.
     * Receive all the materials you will need to have a successful
       fundraiser, including easy to use printed fundraiser flyers.

Who can benefit from an Avon Fundraising

     * Churches
     * Schools
     * Sports Teams
     * Pet Shelters
     * Dance Teams
     * Cheerleading Teams
     * Day Care Centers
     * Senior Citizen Centers
     * Community Centers
     * Bands
     * Volunteer Groups
     * People
     * and many more

Timing & Participation

   We will need to discuss the time frame, the basics of the online
   fundraising opportunity, and how you will promote the organization’s
   exclusive online link. Fundraisers can be up to 60 days, but you can
   extend by another two weeks if your goal hasn’t been met. Consider
   keeping it to a single campaign to maximize order size and earnings. On
   average, you will earn 20% to 30% depending on what your goal is and
   what you actually do. I offer a sliding scale to help you reach your
   goal.

Avon Opportunity Kits Updated

   July 11, 2019July 11, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   Like all companies, sometimes you just have to change things up.
   Starting with C 16, 2019 Avon has changed up the starter kits! They’re
   even better than before and packed with some of our best products! For
   your $30, you are getting an amazing option in kits. Every kit is more
   than double the $30 sign up fee. Not to mention all the other goodies
   you receive too! Unfortunately, you only can pick one of them. It is
   time to spread the word about these amazing sets and all the perks of
   joining the Avon Nation—and get recruiting! When you are apart of Avon
   Nation, you are never alone. I personally am here to get you started
   and support you along the way!
   FREE GIFTS WHEN YOU JOIN!

   All the Bestsellers Set($107 value)
     * Avon True Color Love at 1st Lash Mascara (in Blackest Black), Anew
       Vitamin C Brightening Serum, Avon True Color Eye Shadow Quad (in
       Mocha Latte), Magix Face Perfector (SPF 20), Flourish Honey Blossom
       Eau De Parfum, and 2 Avon Books.

   Skincare Business Builder Set($91.99 value)
     * Anew Hydra Fusion Gel Cream, Anew Hydra Fusion Gel Cream &
       Replenishing Serum Samples, Anew Vitamin C Brightening Serum, Anew
       Vitamin C Brightening Serum Mini Tube Samples, and 6 Avon Books.

   Ultimate Color Set($78 value)
     * Magix Face Perfector (SPF 20), Avon True Color Love at 1st Lash
       Mascara (in Blackest Black), Avon True Color Nourishing
       Lipstick (in Toasted Cashew, Sparkling Rose, and Red
       Delicious), Avon True Color Eye Shadow Quad (in Mocha Latte and
       Romantic Mauve), Avon True Color Glimmerstick Eye Liner (in
       Sterling and Black), and 2 Avon Books.

   When I started selling the kits were different and so were a lot of
   things! I wouldn’t change anything that I have acquired with Avon for
   anything. Although, nothing happens overnight. I have learned all kinds
   of things and still continue to grow my business daily. I have grown as
   an individual and have a great team. When I tell you that the sky is
   the limit with Avon, that is no joke. I wish I started selling years
   ago, I believe that all good things come to everyone. I work hard, but
   honestly, I could work harder and have more customers and teammates,
   but I have a life too. The other great thing with Avon is that they are
   all about incentives and you winning them. Do they take an effort?
   Absolutely! Do I love wining them? Yes, you bet! If I can do this, you
   can too! I look forward to helping you in your journey!

Avon Campaign 13, 2019

   June 7, 2019June 6, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   Ah, summer sun and fun is here — but summer skin needs some extra love.
   Fortunately, Anew special offers are here too! We’re here to help
   renew, revitalize, hydrate, firm and glow with our world-class Anew
   skin care collections at get-it-while-it’s-hot prices. Add a spritz of
   sunshine with Haiku for the hair (genius!) and get everyone glowing
   with shimmering faves.

ANEW SKIN CARE SPOTLIGHT

   It is time to have a self-care moment with Avon. Did you know that Avon
   skincare is always up there with the latest trending products! It is
   now time to turn your skincare regimen into a ritual. As always Avon is
   here to help and so am I. Everyone has a different type of skin and
   that is nothing to worry about, I have you covered! Avon offers this
   short skincare quiz, to help you select which products might help you
   out. In this brochure, if you order any two skincare products you will
   get the eye cream sets for FREE! Yes, I said Free! It is just as
   important to take care of the delicate eye area too!

NEW LIMITED EDITION HAIKU HAIR FRAGRANCE

   Haiku has created a new limited edition hair fragrance. I honestly hope
   that they come out with a whole line of these. The fresh, serene scent
   of Haiku’s jasmine, lilies and sparkling citrus will make you hair
   smell wonderful. As a plus, this hair fragrance has a feather-light
   micro conditioners that won’t weigh your hair down. Order this while
   you can.

Campaign 11, 2019 Brochure

   May 14, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   This campaign is featuring two amazing products. Well, there is a whole
   brochure! So I am going to talk about two new must haves! One of them
   is MAGIX TINT BRIGHTENING TINTED MOISTURIZER and the other is
   #NAKEDPROOF BODY SHEET MASKS.

   MAGIX TINT BRIGHTENING TINTED MOISTURIZER is amazing! LOL, I can’t say
   it enough. Our magical new illuminating moisturizer brightens and blurs
   for an instantly better-than-bare look. This sheer coverage,has an
   all-day naturally radiant finish and has 6 shades for every skin tone.

   #NAKEDPROOF BODY SHEET MASKS, I have not tried at the time of this
   writing. I ordered and will use them when I get back.
   I ordered and will use them when I get back. These were designed for
   summer-ready skin that looks firmer, tighter and totally glow-ier.

   Dare to Bare Décolleté Rejuvenating Sheet Mask Using this one gives you
   visibly plump skin and improves wrinkles while leaving you with an
   instantly youthful glow. Also the improved texture and luminosity,
   gives your skin long-lasting hydration. Something that all skin wants
   during these summer months

   .Stand Firm Body Firming Sheet Mask This one has been a huge hit,
   especially when you see tighter and lifted skin instantly.Who knew a
   mask could stimulate a natural collagen and elastin production, which
   helps firm skin. Now you know you want this one. Bathing Suit season is
   already here!
   Magix has something new for you!

   THIS WILL TAKE YOU TO THE CURRENT AVON BROCHURE AVAILABLE.

Avon Campaign 10, 2019

   April 23, 2019April 22, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   Campaign 10 runs from April 16th to April 30th! As always I will try to
   accommodate any sales price from this book. You can message me if you
   have any questions.

   Avon has revamped the Anew Vitamin C. I love this vitamin C lipstick
   treatment. Don’t miss out on getting it for FREE!

   Meet your new main squeeze for naturally radiant skin. We revamped our
   iconic formula. It’s lighter and absorbs quickly. Still packed with as
   much vitamin C as in 30 oranges, this super serum illuminates your
   dull, tired skin to look visibly energized.

   Get ready to instantly brighten the look of your skin with the power of
   10% pure vitamin C. Show your glow and seize the day!

Avon Flourish Honey Blossom

   April 11, 2019April 10, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   Avon has created this wonderful scent called Honey Blossom! This is
   such a wonderful scent that you all will want one. I currently have
   samples available too. Now on to the details.
   http://www.youravon.com/cfreni

Avon Flourish Honey Blossom Eau de Parfum

   Experience the first sweet bloom of spring with this uplifting scent. A
   bright floral that opens with sparkling apple blossom, blooms to a full
   heart of lively and vibrant honeysuckle nectar and finishes with the
   soft notes of airy vanilla orchid. 1.7 fl. oz.

   NOTES
   Top: Apple blossom
   Middle: Honeysuckle nectar
   Base: Vanilla orchid

   A Note from the Perfumer
   “A long as I can remember, the smell of spring has always brought me
   the feeling of joy, anticipation and the sense of new beginnings. To
   express these feelings, I created a fragrance that gives the sensation
   of the first rays of sun in early spring touching your skin. I wanted
   this single scent to capture the essence of pure happiness and
   comfort.” – Gabriela Chelariu, World-Renowned Perfumer, Firmenich

Anew Ultimate Supreme Dual Elixir

   March 17, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

   Anew Ultimate Supreme Dual Elixir is made of two innovative formulas—a
   unique serum and a luxurious blend of precious oils—combine for one
   supreme elixir that’s 3 x more powerful than a serum alone. The serum
   and oil are separated to preserve their potency and even more powerful
   when they meet. Blend them together to activate and enhance their
   benefits for the ultimate youth-boosting skin care experience.

   With these two powerful ingredients you get equal amounts of Serum/Oil,
   — .67 fl. oz. each.

   In just 1 week, 89% showed improvement in texture, radiance, wrinkles,
   firmness and moisture. In 2 weeks, 94% saw a difference in the most
   advanced signs of aging. Below is the list of the benefits.
   BENEFITS
   • Rare Tahitian Black Pearl Extract is shown to enhance skin’s ability
   to retain moisture—see a dramatic difference in deep wrinkles and skin
   radiance
   • Camellia oil is rich in essential fatty acids, helping to improve
   skin’s texture and firmness
   • Precious argan oil, or “liquid gold,” is rich in vitamin E to visibly
   infuse skin with radiant moisture
   • Superior serum helps visibly restore age-related damage
   • Hypoallergenic
   • Allergy-tested
   • Dermatologist-tested
   • Non-comedogenic
   • Absorbs quickly
   • Suitable for all skin types

   The biggest bonus is that you can add this to your current Anew line up
   with out missing a beat.

   TO USE
   Apply twice daily (AM and PM). Dispense into palm of hand, blend well
   and massage over cleansed face and neck. Use alone or follow with your
   favorite Anew moisturizer.

Campaign 7, 2019

   March 16, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

Shop My Avon Store

   My question to you is “What skin care products are you currently using?
   Please do not tell me that you are not using anything! That is
   absolutely the worse thing that you can be doing. The sun, wind and
   cold are so bad for your skin. Never underestimate them. This brochure
   is featuring our newest skincare product. It is part of the Anew
   family.

   Meet Anew Ultimate Dual Elixir Serum. This is a must have for anyone,
   even if this is the only item that you buy. I wouldn’t recommend just
   this item. You need a good cleanser too! Dual Elixir works with any of
   Avon’s Skincare Products, matter of fact it is an awesome addition to
   what you are currently using! If you are looking for a skincare
   routine, I will be happy to help. I do have a sample of our latest
   innovation and most other skincare products that I’d love you to try.

   Some of the key facts for the Anew Ultimate Dual Elixir are the
   following:
     * A luxurious blend of precious oils and a unique serum that’s 3
       times more powerful than a serum alone.
     * In just one week, 89% showed improvement in texture, radiance,
       wrinkles, firmness and moisture.
     * In 2 weeks, 94% saw a difference in the most advanced signs of
       aging.
     * Black pearl extract serum and luxurious oils are sealed separately,
       pump to combine and unlock the magic.
     * Next-level Anew skin care, pairs perfectly with Anew Ultimate
       Supreme Advanced Performance Creme.

   [avon-campaign-8-brochure.jpg?w=480] Campaign 8 2019

   campaigns. If you ordered a fragrance from the online shop then you
   know what it is! Online Shop is giving out samples. Register online to

Campaign 4, 2019

   February 5, 2019 Cathysworldofbeauty

Shop the Avon Store

   Campaign 4, is all about the #NakedProof! This is available in three
   options. The one that everyone wants to try is Smooth Moves
   Anti-Cellulite Cooling Gel.  Feel the anti-cellulite gel work instantly
   to quickly target cellulite for visibly smoother skin and improved
   texture. 98% saw improvement in just 4 weeks, with the cooling gel
   dramatically reducing the look of even the most persistent cellulite.

   Option #2 is the amazing, End of the Line Stretch Mark Minimizing
   Lotion.
   With the stretch mark lotion, stretch marks are instantly diffused and
   in 2 weeks, the appearance of stretch marks is dramatically reduced.
   What a difference 2 weeks can make.

   The 3rd option in this family is Affirm Yourself Firming Body Cream.
   The firming body cream is clinically proven to visibly banish crepey
   skin for a more toned, defined look. In fact, 96% showed improvement in
   firmness and tone of their abdomen and hip area*.  The results were
   based on a 12-week study.

   As with any of these products, it is nice to see quick results.
   However, you should keep using so you can really see the difference
   overall. I would love to hear what you have to say about these
   wonderful products. I encourage you to take before and after photos
   using any of the #NakedProof products. If you would like to share them
   on my Facebook page, let me know.
   This will take you to the current Avon Brochure Available.

   In addition to the #Nakedproof family of products, Avon has great
   offers on our Iconic Skin So Soft line and of course Ladies Fragrances.
   Spoiler Alert: We are going to have a new fragrance coming out in a few
   campaigns. If you ordered a fragrance from the online shop then you
   know what it is! Online Shop is giving out samples. Register online to
   receive special offers for online only.

   Let us not forget that Valentines Day is right around the corner. Avon
   has the gifts for that special person in your life. Even something for
   the kiddos too.
