Tryptophan Trail Run

   by This is Carrie on December 8, 2013

   Image 4

   Instead of Black Friday shopping, I opted for the Tryptophan Trail Run
   in Trabuco Canyon organized by Skyler of The Endurance Family.  From
   the moment I arrived, I could immediately tell I was way out of my
   league.  I might have been the only one in the gorup not talking about
   an upcoming ultra distance trail run.

   Even so, they let me tag along and we logged 15 miles and 3,700’+ of
   elevation gain in the rain.

   So glad I got to share this First Annual Trail Run tradition with my
   visiting niece (my running inspiration).

Thanksgiving 10K 2013: Plymouth Rock ‘n Run

   by This is Carrie on December 7, 2013

   IMG_7345

   Turkey Trots are just as important to our Thanksgiving tradition as
   Turkey.  Instead of dressing up turkey-like, the kids opted for Santa
   costumes and Sparkle Athletic skirts, shouting “Merry Thanksgiving!” to
   everyone around them.

   Made with Repix (http://repix.it)

   The three youngest did the Kids K while Princess ran the 5K with her
   friend at the slowest pace since she was 6 years old.  But they had fun
   skipping down the route handing out imaginary turkeys to the other
   runners, so that’s all that matters, right?

   At 3 years old, Baby Brother is an old pro at races, telling me “i’m
   going to go fast, you keep up”

   IMG_7324

   I do my best when I can latch onto someone running just outside my
   comfort zone and luckily I found that woman at mile 2. She was amazing
   and totally encouraging once she found out that I was pacing off her.
   For the first time in a while, I pushed myself to the “puke point”
   right before the finish line. After my considerable break from running
   on a regular basis, it felt good and bad all at the same time.

   It wasn’t a PR, but it felt good knowing I’m not starting at square one
   as I head into Boston Marathon training. Luckily my road biking and Hit
   the Mark Fitness BootCamp has sustained some level of fitness.

Time: 49:23
Pace: 7:57/M

Making Stuff: Sweater Knit Dress {Mood Sewing Network}

   by This is Carrie on December 5, 2013

   photo 1-2

   I’d never sewn with a sweater knit before but when I spotted this
   gorgeous, lightweight, italian wool sweater-knit at Mood Fabrics I
   decided it was time to give it a try.

   V1315

   During a Vogue pattern sale, I picked up this Rebecca Taylor pattern
   (V1315) (despite it’s awkward photo).

   sketch copy copy

   It was those amazing droopy pockets that got me.  I cut size 8 based on
   my measurements, but I wished I would have added more length in the
   bodice. Since I don’t sew for myself very often, I forget that I am
   long-waisted.  To see more pics of the finished product and the amazing
   neck detail, head over to the Mood Sewing Network blog.

Making Stuff: Spider Bean Bag Toss Game {Lion Brand Yarn}

   by This is Carrie on November 15, 2013

   spider bean bag toss

   I imagined and began this Spider Bean Bag Toss game over two years ago
   when I first got my hands on a pack of Lion Brand Bon Bons. I finally
   finished all the spiders just a few days before this last Halloween.
   Finally getting it up on the blog a couple months later which you can
   either consider too late for last Halloween, or amazingly early for
   next Halloween.

   photo 4

   Just in time for some pre-trick-or-treating festivities with the
   neighbors. photo 5

   Supplies:

   Scrap fabric at least 6″x12″  for each spider, 1 package of Lion Brand
   Yarn Cotton Bon Bons, googly eyes, spider web mat (fond mine in the
   dollar section of Target).

   Download Spider Bean Bag pattern PDF HERE.

   bon_bon_yarn

   1.Cut 2 spider shapes out of each fabric

   2. Cut 84 pieces of yarn 12″ long. Separate into 12 strands. braid 3
   strands together, securing at each end.  I suggest cutting a piece of
   cardboard 12′ long and winding yarn around it then cutting at each end
   all at once.

   3. Fold yarn legs in half and baste two pieces to each side of spider
   body creating four legs.

   4. Sew spider body shapes right sides together from mark to mark
   leaving a hole.

   5. Trim and turn

   6. Fill with “bean” of choice. I like to use rice or lentils.

   7. Hand sew hole closed

   8. Glue on googly eyes.

   photo 1

   You’re probably going to be jealous of my spider mat which I found in
   the Target dollar section 2 years ago. I can’t believe how perfect it
   is for this little bean bag toss game.  A web could also be made out of
   posterboard or fabric.

Making Stuff: Baptism Dress {Mood Sewing Network Project}

   by This is Carrie on October 26, 2013

   baptism dress

   Before I cut into my beautiful Anna Sui eyelet fabric from Mood
   Designer Fabrics, I knew I needed to test my self-made dress pattern.

   printed dress

   I didn’t want to make the sample dress from muslin…you know…just in
   case it turned out great. A piece of lightweight, printed cotton from
   the stash was just what I needed.

   printed dress

   I worked out a few kinks in the construction process and decided the
   bodice was a little too full.

   printed dress Making practice garments in something new to my sewing
   habits (I’ve been more of an instant gratification kind of sewer the
   past few years). But, each time, the practice has proven invaluable to
   creating a more perfect and less frustrating final piece. When you work
   with gorgeous fabrics, the extra time is worth the trouble before you
   cut into the good stuff.  You must check out the finished product over
   at the Mood Sewing Network blog: Anna Sui eyelet baptism dress.

Halloween at the Discovery Science Center

   by This is Carrie on October 15, 2013

   There’s no better time to visit the Discovery Science Center than the
   month of October when you can “explore pumpkins, learn about the phases
   of the moon, explore a spooky 3-D maze, check out spiders of all sizes
   and colors, and much more” at the Spooky Science exhibit.

   There is nothing more spooky than getting up close and personal with
   tarantulas and black widow spiders.

   The kids can get their “craft on” making googly-eyed jack-o-lanterns.

   On the weekends, the little goblins can make slime, participate in a
   costume parade, and see special stage shows like “The Wizard of Ooze.”

   You definitely don’t want to miss the 3-D maze.  It really is amazing!

   Spooky Science isn’t the only featured exhibit at The Discovery Science
   Center right now. The Science of Ripley’s Believe it or Not has come to
   the center and will be staying until January 5, 2014.  The kids have
   been obsessed with the Ripley’s believe it or Not books for a few years
   now and have been dying to go to one of their many museums.

   This exhibit is a great, kid-friendly taste of Ripley’s “compendium of
   oddities, anomalies and fantastic feats” as well as the science behind
   the unbelievable collection.  With it’s many hands-on elements, I
   haven’t ever been to a museum exhibit that could entertain all four of
   my children (ages 2-11) at their own levels for an extended amount of
   time.

   Make friends with a Megalodon…..jaw casting.

   Be stumped by the “mystery gate” (they eventually figured it out).

   See how you measure up to he world’s tallest man.

   You don’t want to miss these two great exhibits at the Discovery
   Science Center this October (both included in regular museum
   admission).  Find out more details HERE.

   My children and I received a preview of The Discovery Science Center’s
   Spooky Science and The Science of Ripley’s Believe it or Not exhibits.
   All opinions in the post are my own.

Making Stuff: Vintage Baby Dress {Mood Sewing Network}

   by This is Carrie on September 22, 2013

   You have got to check out my latest post over at the Mood Sewing
   Network.  It might be the best/cutest/most immaculate thing I’ve ever
   made.  At least I think so.  Starting off with a gorgeous Marc Jacobs
   print from Mood Designer Fabrics definitely helped this project get
   started on the right foot.

   Finally seeing the dress on it’s recipient really sealed the deal.
   All-time favorite dress.  Such a doll.
