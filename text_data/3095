Use your PS4 Controller on your PC to its full potential

   DS4Windows is a portable program that allows you to get the best
   experience while using a DualShock 4 on your PC. By emulating a Xbox
   360 controller, many more games are accessible.

Simple & Clean UI

   Since the idea is to get to get your controller ready for games, The UI
   was made to make to be quick to pick up. Once first launched, the tool
   takes your through the setup, gives you a default profile and you're
   ready to go, or if you choose you can change things to your heart's
   content.
   Initial Screen

Profile System

   With profiles, it makes it easier to quickly swap through various
   settings for your controller. You can set up controls for certain
   games, or set the lightbar to your favorite color. You can even swipe
   two fingers along the touchpad to swap profiles without the need to
   even open back the program.
   Profile Settings

Automatic Profiles

   Along with switching profiles manually, you can also switch your
   controllers to different profiles automatically when certain programs
   are launched.
   Auto Profiles Screen

Tons of options

   From control mapping, to touchpad sensitivity, to marcos, to rainbow
   lightbar, to motion controls, to special actions triggerd by pressing
   multiple actions, to launching a program with profiles, there are
   plenty of settings to play around with.

    1. Download zip
    2. Extract the 2 programs (DS4Windows and DS4Updater) in the zip
       wherever you please (My Docs, Program Files, etc.)
    3. Launch DS4Windows
    4. If not in Program Files, choose where you want to save profiles
    5. A windows will pop up showing how to install the driver, if not, go
       to settings and click "Controller/Driver Setup"
         1. If you have used SCP's tool in the past,  you may need to
            uninstall the drivers to use the DS4 with bluetooth
    6. Connect the DS4 via a micro usb or through bluetooth (DS4 Device
       name: "Wireless Controller") may need to enter pair code: 0000)
    7. All should be good to go once you connect the controller, if not
       restart DS4Windows, or even your computer.
          + Note: same games work with the DS4 without DS4Windows (however
            it does use rumble etc.) Games like these can cause double
            input in menus (ie pressing down on the dpad moves 2 spaces)
            or the wrong button to do incorrect functions. To solve this,
            check Hide DS4 in the settings, if you see a warning in the
            log/text on the bottom, that means you must close said game or
            client that causes the conflict and reconnect the controller.

       actions or macros

FAQ

     * Is bluetooth audio support coming?
          + So long as I work by myself, never. I don't have the know-how
            to understand reverse engineering the DualShock 4 to enable
            its audio jack.
     * What about CSR and Toshiba bluetooth adapters?
          + I can't say for certain about either, I've picked up a CSR
            adapater, and will attempt to make it work, but no guarantees.
     * I'm getting double input/ Weird input in some games, how do I fix
       it?
          + That's because the game tries too (though usually badly)
            support the DS4 on it's own. You can solve this by enabling
            Hide DS4 Controller in DS4Windows' settings, then connect the
            controller BEFORE you launch the game.
     * Keyboard emulation isn't working in game, what do?
          + When setting a key for a button, check the scan code box. This
            isn't a guarantee to work with all games, but it will add
            support for more games. If scan code doesn't work with the
            game, then DS4Windows simply can't emulate for that game.
     * Why is Dinput only mode acting weird when using the controller with
       bluetooth
          + Currently BT doesn't work with Dinput mode.
