The World's Most Reknown Airport Shuttles

SuperShuttle’s History

   Created 30 years ago in California, SuperShuttle pioneered the
   shared-ride airport ground transportation concept. Today, SuperShuttle
   is the first shared-ride airport transportation service worlwide,
   providing door-to-door service for over 8 million passengers per year.
   Currently, SuperShuttle provides service to and from more than 40
   airports and over 50 cities and has approximately 1,200 distinctive
   blue and yellow vans on the road. At SuperShuttle, we strive to
   maintain our founding principles of quality, superb passenger service,
   responsiveness, reliability and passenger safety, by thoroughly
   expanding our offer thanks to our numerous quality partnerships. In
   2007, SuperShuttle became a wholly owned subsidiary of Transdev, a
   global leader of the transportation industry. In September 2009,
   SuperShuttle Paris started operations, offering shared and private
   shuttles to or from Paris’ airports (Paris Charles de Gaulle, Paris
   Orly and Paris Beauvais), the city of Paris (and its suburbs), along
   with Disneyland Paris.

Transdev Group

   Multimodal transport specialist, Transdev combines QoS, economic
   performance and sense of general interest. Through its global expertise

How does SuperShuttle work ?

The Supershuttle Concept

   Savvy travellers share a shuttle in the same direction to or from the
   airport. This is the solution to travel more easily, at a cheaper fare
   than a taxi, and also to avoid airport parking or public transport.
   Between public transportation and taxis, SuperShuttle is the perfect
   solution for traveling between the three Paris airports : Paris Roissy
   Charles-De-Gaulle (CDG), Paris Orly (ORY) and Paris Beauvais-Tillé
   (BVA), the city of Paris (train stations and neighboring suburbs
   included) or Disneyland® Paris.

How to Book?

   For inbound travels (going to the airport), SuperShuttle will suggest a
   pickup time tailored to your flight departure time to guarantee a
   stress-free on-time arrival at the airport, including in peak hours.
   For outbound travels (leaving the airport), SuperShuttle will track
   your flight to adjust the pickup time to your landing time. You receive
   an immediate booking confirmation by e-mail. You are free to change or
   cancel this booking up to 6 hours before your departure time.
   Book your airport transfer on the app, online or via phone
   supershuttle.fr or on our app! 24/24h
   Our customer care team is available everyday to answer you on the phone
   and on social media from 8 am to 8 pm + 33 1 41 47 13 00 Monday to
   Friday from 9AM to 5PM
   At Paris airports, you can also book a SuperShuttle for a pickup 15
   minutes later. SuperShuttle is available at Paris Orly and Paris Roissy
   Charles-De-Gaulle in all terminals from “Tourist Information” desks. In
   Paris Beauvais, rides are available at SuperShuttle counter in T1 and
   T2.

Shared Ride

   SuperShuttle will pick you up and drop you at the address you have
   chosen and send you a text message a few minutes before the arrival of
   your driver. At the airport, simply go to the meeting point written on
   your confirmation to find your SuperShuttle driver. The SuperShuttle is
   a premium 8-seater minivan, with air conditioning. SuperShuttle can
   make a maximum of 3 stops along the way to board other smart travelers.
   Useful tip : you get a free WiFi connection during the trip. At the end
   of your trip, you will receive satisfaction survey by email to evaluate
   your SuperShuttle ride and possibly report a default.

   SuperShuttle customer journey

Premium Formula: Our Private Service

   Our 8-seater minivan is also available for private exclusive service
   for traveling to and from the airport or train station of your choice.
   Would you link to find out more about the private shuttle fares ? Once
   you have collected your luggage, you will benefit from a personalized
   greeting and airport assistance. There is no waiting, no restrictions
   on luggage; the ride is fast and direct. This service is particularly
   suitable for large families and passengers with bulky luggage (bikes,
   skis, golf clubs…) and also people travelling to final destinations
   other than Paris’ City Centre. If you are planning a group event or
   corporate event, the private minivan service is perfectly suited for
   you ! Should you have any question regarding our offer or your
   reservation, please feel free to contact our Customer Care teams !
