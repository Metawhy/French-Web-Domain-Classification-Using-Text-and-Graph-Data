A Marketer’s Guide to Personalization

   HOME / Resources / A Marketer’s Guide to Personalization

   September 7, 2018

   Marketers are on an ever-evolving journey to identify their best
   customers, find more like them, and retain them by building positive
   connections with them. The goal, in short, is to give the consumer what
   they want, so they keep coming back for more. But how do you make sure
   each consumer’s experience is personalized to match their particular
   stage of the customer journey for maximum efficiency? Meet the
   Marketer’s Guide to Personalization. Download the Guide!

   This guide includes:
     * Personalization Use Cases, including
          + Real-Time Content Targeting
          + Personalizing Ad Content
          + Omnichannel Personalization
          + Optimizing Media Spends
          + Sequential Messaging
          + A/B Split Testing
     * How Personalization Works
     * Quick Wins with Personalization

   Download The Marketer’s Guide to Personalization by filling out the
   form below, and get started offering your customers custom experiences
   they will love:


   We also have a Publisher version of this content personalization guide
   available if that suits you better. Check it out!

   Tailoring experiences to individual consumers is nothing new. Think
   about omnichannel marketing like a personal shopper: a dedicated
   consultant following you around as you shop, helping you find what you
   need, and hoping you’ll spend big. Marketing personalization is
   fundamentally the same, except that instead of one personal shopper
   targeting one customer in one store, omnichannel marketing is doing it
   on a massive scale—personalizing experiences for thousands of consumers
   across different channels.

   Marketers have a never-ending array of tools available to help identify
   and communicate with their ideal consumers. At the heart of the
   marketing tech stack is the data management platform (DMP), used to
   collect, organize, and activate data assets from any source. DMPs were
   originally created to power audience targeted advertising, but their
   capabilities go far beyond, and many are turning to the audiences
   available in their DMP to help power personalization.

   Personalization enables marketers to serve segment-specific content and
   messaging to your audience at every touchpoint along the conversion
   funnel.

   Lotame has created this Guide to Personalization to help marketers
   understand how a DMP can help use your powerful audience data to offer
   personalized experiences to each of your most valuable
   customers. Download the Guide!
