Evacuation of the surviving troops from Arnhem

   after the evacuation and having their first drink. One of them, Captain
   Jan Linzel (second from left) is a member of the Dutch Royal Navy
   attached to No 10 Commando.

   After over a week of intense fighting it was finally decided to
   withdraw the remaining men of the 1st Airborne Division from their
   isolated position on the outskirts of Arnhem. They were pulled out in
   small groups from the defence line in Oosterbeek so that the Germans
   would not guess what was happening. Of the 10,000 who had arrived by
   parachute and glider, about 2,500 got away across the Rhine during the
   night of the 25th/26th. Many of those left behind could not be
   extricated because they were wounded.

   Glider Pilot Louis Hagen had narrowly avoided becoming a casualty and
   describes the final stages of their escape:

     All along the path there were mortar pits and the bodies of dead and
     wounded soldiers. We reached the banks of the Rhine and joined a
     long queue of men waiting to be ferried across. Someone came up to
     us and told us to spread out as the mortaring might be resumed any
     minute.

     There were at least 100 men in front of us and no sign of a
     boat.There were other parties like ours all along the river,
     waiting. The splash of oars could be heard now and then. I suppose
     this was how they felt at Dunkirk. A small canvas boat was
     approaching at last. It took ten men across. Then we realised our
     desperate position.Any moment the mortaring might start again.There
     was no cover at all and we crouched in the deep squelchy mud. We
     were frozen with cold and soaked from the rain.

     The mortaring started up again, not directly where we were, but near
     enough to be frightening. After trenches and street fighting, and
     even the cover of the woods, we felt helplessly exposed.The thought
     of those ghastly bodies and the groans of the wounded, lying in the
     meadows, was in everyone’s mind, but no one said anything. We just
     crouched there shivering.

     I began surveying our position in my mind. Of course this had
     nothing in common with Dunkirk, and those who ordered us to wait in
     line patiently until we were taken off by those ridiculous little
     canvas assault boats did not know what they were doing.The Rhine was
     only 250 yards wide and quite narrow at certain spots near us.

     Why was not the order given for those of us who could swim to dump
     their arms and make for the other side? Surely it would have been
     possible to organise a rope and stretch it across for those who were
     not strong swimmers? But instead we were being heroic, playing at
     Dunkirk, and a great many men who could have escaped to safety would
     be casualties or else be taken prisoner at dawn.

     I had to get out of this. I told Captain Z that I couldn’t stand
     this any longer and that I was going to try and swim for it. Now we
     had got this far I didn’t intend to take any more risks than were
     necessary. The boat system was obviously hopelessly inadequate and,
     apart from relieving some of-this awful congestion on the bank and
     leaving the boats, such as they were to the non—swimmers, I honestly
     thought it was the best way out. He agreed with me and shouted to
     the rest of our glider pilot section that we were going on to a
     promontory where the river narrowed a bit.

     A large crowd followed us, but I doubt if any of them realised where
     we were going or what we intended to do.They just came after us
     because at least we seemed to have some kind of plan. Had they been
     told that the river was only 250 yards wide, though it looked rather
     more in the dark, many would have followed us, orders or no orders.

     We had to climb some large boulders on our way to the promontory. At
     the end, it went steeply down into the water and would have made a
     far better landing stage for the rescue boats than the mud flats, as
     at least the bank gave a little cover.

     From here the opposite bank didn’t look too far and the prospect of
     doing something after the misery of queuing up on all fours in the
     mud made Captain Z, and me feel quite cheerful. ‘Well do it again,
     you and me!’ he said.

     We proceeded to take our boots off and hung them round our necks.
     Captain Z gave his rifle to Lieutenant X, who unfortunately couldn’t
     swim, and remarked that he must keep his haversack with him as the
     Company ‘Office’ etc., was in it. I kept all my arms and ammo as we
     couldn’t be sure what would greet us on the other side.

   Hagen was to discover that he couldn’t quite manage the swim with his
   gun and ammunition – and had to dump them half way across – but he got
   to the other bank safely. See Louis Hagen: Arnhem Lift: A German Jew in
   the Glider Pilot Regiment

   Also amongst those who escaped across the river was Stanley Moss:

     I have nothing but admiration for those Canadian Engineers as they
     ferried soldiers across the river all night. It never occurred to me
     that I couldn’t swim and I felt a little guilty at having jumped the
     queue, but what the hell…

     For the first time in eight days I felt relatively safe. If any of
     the Canadian Engineers who were in that boat that carried me across
     the river remember the incident and happen to see this, I would like
     to thank them from the bottom of my heart.

     …

     As I looked around I saw tired faces everywhere, grimy, proud,
     undefeated faces and I wanted to cry. I didn’t recognise anybody and
     I had no idea how many others had made it. We had all been through
     so much together. Everywhere I looked I saw the eyes of men who had
     seen too much, given too much. Everywhere I looked I saw a hero.

     But for every man that had escaped many more had died, been wounded
     or captured and they had no one to tell their story. My experiences
     in those eight days would remain with me for the rest of my life.

The casualties mount inside Oosterbeek

   24 September 1944: The casualties mount inside Oosterbeek‘How is it
   with you ?’ I shouted. He shouted back ‘My leg is broken.’ I wriggled
   my own injured leg about. It worked. Something would now have to be
   done about his. There was a dull, singing little pain in my middle, as
   perhaps the nose cap of whatever it was that had burst had bounced up
   and hit me there. I looked around the safe and friendly little trench,
   reluctant to leave it for the chill, hostile world outside.

Arnhem: civilians caught up in the middle of the battle

   23 September 1944: Arnhem: civilians caught up in the middle of the
   battleI showed him down the dark stairs, and he went to work
   immediately. The first thing he did, after seeing the injury, was to
   give the woman a morphia injection. Then he began the tedious and
   revolting process of removing the bandages. The blood had seeped
   through them and dried; now the dressing was a solid crust all mixed up
   with what was left of her toes. It took the orderly over an hour.

British airborne troops fight on in Oosterbeek

   22 September 1944: British airborne troops fight on in
   OosterbeekWhatever might be the preoccupation of the Germans they were
   not too busy, or on the defensive, to be debarred from putting up a
   terrific barrage that took painful toll of the lumbering planes.
   Unfortunately, in spite of the tenacious courage of the airmen, the
   greater part of the supplies again failed to fall within the perimeter,
   and the many spectators from the hospital who rushed out to watch had
   the chagrin of seeing coloured parachutes opening in huge clusters over
   the enemy-held territory nearer the town.

Cellar casualties hit by grenade in final stand

   21st September 1944: Cellar casualties hit by grenade in final
   standThen I heard them fighting in the house above us — shots and
   screams; they made all kinds of noises when they were ghting, just like
   animals. Then the door burst open and the Germans came in. A British
   soldier jumped in front of Peter Warr and I, with his back to the
   Germans. Then there were two terric explosions — German grenades. The
   British soldier was hit in the back and fell forward, over me: he was
   dead.

Arnhem: British paratroopers continue to hold out

   21 September 1944 : Arnhem: British paratroopers continue to hold outIt
   wasn’t all grim, square-jawed stuff, we had some laughs like when a
   German Psychological unit in a van came up and bellowed through the
   loud-hailer that we were good blokes and marvellous fighters, and that
   if we would surrender we would be treated as heroes and all this guff.
   The answer of course was cat calls, “Up yours from Wigan.” “Get
   knotted,” and other military replies and when it came next day somebody
   fired a P.I.A.T. bomb right into it. They didn’t send another one!

Nijmegen: the 82nd Airborne assault across the Waal

   20 September 1944: Nijmegen: the 82nd Airborne assault across the
   WaalDefenseless, frail, canvas boats jammed to overflowing with
   humanity, all striving desperately to get across the Waal as quickly as
   possible. Large numbers of men were being hit in all boats and the
   bottoms of these crafts were littered with the wounded and dead. Here
   and there on the surface of the water was a paddle dropped by some poor
   unfortunate before the man taking his place had been able to retrieve
   it from his lifeless fingers.

Arnhem becomes a desperate battle for survival

   19 September 1944: Arnhem becomes a desperate battle for survivalLater
   in the same day Captain Queripel found himself cut off with a small
   party of men and took up a position in a ditch. By this time he had
   received further wounds in both arms. Regardless of his wounds and the
   very heavy mortar and Spandau fire, he continued to inspire his men to
   resist with hand grenades, pistols and the few remaining rifles.

Second wave drop into Arnhem meets deadly reception

   18 September 1944: Second parachute drop into Arnhem meets deadly
   receptionFor a split second the wooshing stops and then KERBOOM! The
   mortar shell explodes nearby, followed by several more incoming shells.
   Dirt and smoke are thrown up into the air but, as suddenly as it
   started, the firing ceases. Through the falling dirt and choking smoke,
   A lone soldier can be heard screaming for help. Moss looks up from his
   hiding place and sees the soldier covered in blood, screaming in agony.
   A couple of Medics run to his aid. Slowly, the rest of the soldiers
   emerge and resume their places in the static column. It’s as if nothing
   happened.

Market Garden: Allied airborne attack into Holland

   17 September 1944: Market Garden: Allied airborne attack into
   HollandHowever, there was no delay, and as we passed their old
   positions we found two lorries and three motor-cars in various stages
   of destruction, also an untidy little bunch of dead and wounded
   Germans. It seemed a pity that the vehicles were now unusable, but
   there had been no time to arrange a road-block. It was however a very
   encouraging start. Approximately thirty Germans, including officers
   among them, and valuable transport, accounted for without loss to
   ourselves.

       And in between them, my paratroopers, with contempt in their eyes,
       fulfilling their duties in an exemplary way! In tatters, in many
       cases wounded, dead beat and starving, but despite all still

    We saw them coming and I was the only one who could do anything about
     it; the 75mms would have to be within 300 yards to do anything to a
   Tiger. Sergeant Gordon, our tank commander said to us ‘Wait until they
   are about 800 yards’. So, we waited and then he pulled us forward out
    of the orchard. You need to get out of the trees to traverse the gun.

   The ‘Black Devils’, as they were known, were involved in Operation
   Totalize, starting on 8 August, and they were engaged in heavy fighting
   for Chambois and Mont Ormel. They then fought a fierce battle in their
      Sherman and Cromwell tanks to stop the Germans escaping from the
               Falaise Pocket, as part of Operation Tractable.
