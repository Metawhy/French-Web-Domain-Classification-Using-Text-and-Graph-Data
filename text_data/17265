Bio

   Mari Samuelsen, one of today’s most innovative and imaginative
   violinist, is enjoying a remarkable rise on the international concert
   stage through a mixture of artistry and breathtaking musical finesse.

   A classically trained violinist, her studies with Arve Tellefsen and
   later at the Barratt Due Institute of Music in Oslo were followed by a
   decade with world-renowned professor Zakhar Bron at the Zurich
   University of the Arts.

   Mari regularly performs at the world’s most prestigious concert halls
   and as soloist with leading orchestras in Europe, Asia and the US. She
   also closely collaborates with electronic music artists and
   contemporary composers.

   Mari has an exclusive recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon. She
   plays a G.B. Guadagnini violin (Turin 1773) kindly on loan from the
   Anders Sveaas’ Charitable Foundation.

   Her first single, Max Richter’s “November”, was released in January
   2019 coinciding with the ARTE broadcast of her spectacular performance
   last October at Beijing’s Forbidden City. Her first album on the Yellow
   Label will come out in early summer 2019.


   New album – 07.06.19

   MARI by Mari Samuelsen explores our longing to feel grounded, to escape
   into nature, and how that sits with the modern notion of global
   citizens and the busy, fulfilling lives we wish to lead. “This contrast
   is something we’ll see more and more of”, says Mari. “The urge to live
   slow is going to become more important in order to keep yourself, your
   life and your mind in balance. But when you are conscious of these two,
   contrasting worlds, one can experience ‘a moment of flow’, where you
   are able reconcile these opposites, if only fleetingly.”

   MARI was conceived over the course of a year and a half, a process that
   was constantly evolving. Mindful of the power music has to transport
   people back in time or to certain places, Mari sought out pieces and
   composers that were evocative of dreams and a childlike innocence, as
   well as the contrast inherent in our perceptions of modern living and
   culture. “Things that are beautiful but not tangible” was one
   criterion; “places and memories that are pure and untouched” another.

   “…MARI is just one step in the direction that I will continue in for
   years to come; it’s the beginning of a journey, and I’m constantly
   exploring new ideas and widening my musical horizon.” – Mari Samuelsen


   The album contains works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Philip Glass, Max
   Richter, Peter Gregson, Johann Johannsson, Brian Eno, Pēteris Vasks and
   others.
