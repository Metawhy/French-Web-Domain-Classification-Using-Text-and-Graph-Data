Benjamin Legros

   Benjamin is co-founder of Mercenaries Engineering and one of the
   Guerilla Render architect.

   Young 3d developer prodigy, he won at 19 “The Party”, the biggest demo
   scene contest with a realtime demo featuring his 3d engine written in
   assembly on an Amiga 500. After graduating from Ensimag in computer
   science and applied mathematics, he first worked for video games,
   developing technology for the Ryzom MMORPG. In 2005, he co-founded
   Mercenaries Engineering, and has been working since then developing
   Guerilla Render and providing support for many companies, including On
   Entertainment, Prime Focus or Mikros Image.
