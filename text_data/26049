   Some species can lift up to 850 times their own weight.
   Males use their horns to compete for mating rights.
   Before a fight, they hook themselves into a tree branch.
   A winner is decided when one is thrown from the branch.
   Fights can mean life or death, as falling to the forest floor exposes
   them to predators.
   They are being studied by mechanical engineers in hopes to improve
   aircraft designs.

   Help Save Kenya's Lions
   Transcript
   Shivani: I'm a fourth generation Kenyan and I live in a tent in one of
   the most beautiful landscapes in the world, Samburu in Northern Kenya.
   It is here that I protect one of Kenya's most iconic species; the lion.
   In under a century we have lost over 90% of our planet's lions. The
   situation in Kenya is just as serious. We are down to less than 1,000
   lions in our country. What's happening? Why are we losing so many
   lions? In Northern Kenya, where I live and work, lions are running out
   of space. As human numbers increase and more livestock comes along,
   there's more pressure that's being put on lions. Unfortunately, when
   this happens, lions go out, they come into close contact with the local
   people and they cause conflict. Livestock such as camels, donkeys,
   cows, they're much easier to kill than a wild animal, like an impala or
   a gazelle. This happens often in our area. Lions target livestock but
   this causes a lot of anger and resentment amongst the local people
   whose livelihoods depend on this livestock. They often will go out and
   retaliate and they will shoot, spear or poison lions.
   Together with my team in Samburu an incredibly dedicated, passionate
   and enthusiastic group of elders, warriors and women. We run the Ewaso
   Lions Project. Our mission is to promote the co-existence between lions
   and people that share this landscape. We do this through a number of
   community and awareness education programs. One of our main ones is a
   program called Warrior Watch. Warriors are young men aged between 15 to
   30. The warrior in the middle in this picture his name is Jeneria. He's
   a very special young man who's my assistant. He came to me many years
   ago and he said, “You know Shivani, my age mates, my fellow warriors,
   why are they not involved in conservation? We could do a great job, if
   we just involved all of them.” I said, “Let's bring them on board.
   Let's see, if they want to be involved in conservation.” He brought
   over five warriors from his community and he asked them. He said, “Do
   you guys want to be involved in conservation? Do you want to learn
   about why it's important to conserve these animals?” They said, “Yes,
   of course. We are the eyes and the ears in the bush. We see wildlife
   everyday. Absolutely involve us.”
   Thanks to the Big Cats Initiative we started with five warriors and now
   we've grown to over 15 warriors working in this region. They have
   various roles. One of them is to patrol their areas. They all live in
   their villages, they go out during the day, they see what's in the
   area, they scan it. If there's predators in the area, they communicate
   that message back to the herders who are out there with their
   livestock. We've taught them how to use GPS's, so as they're herding
   their livestock they can tell us what they're seeing. What amazing
   wildlife animals they see during the day. Both sightings of predators
   and also tracks. You can see in this picture Precy, one of our
   warriors. He's got his finery, he's got his knife, his bracelets and
   right next to his knife is a little GPS unit with a pen. This is all
   our warriors. They go out dressed like this everyday. This is their
   normal way of life.
   We asked the warriors, In exchange for all this fantastic wildlife
   information that you give to us, what would you like in return? And
   they said education. We've never had that opportunity to go to school.
   We don't know how to read and write. We started a Sunday school with
   the warriors five years ago. Now I'm very excited to say that all of
   our warriors can read and write, both in English and our national
   language Kiswahili. We evaluated this program a couple of years ago to
   really understand how it was working in the community and we were so
   excited with the results. They were very positive. They showed that the
   local people's attitudes towards predators have greatly improved as a
   result of the warriors working with them. The warriors also felt much
   more socially empowered as a result of this project.
   The women came to us and they said, “You're working with warriors,
   you're working with elders and children.  Where are we?  We want to be
   involved in this project as well and where is our school?  We want to
   learn how to read and write as well.” We started a Saturday school with
   the women just last year through a new program we have launched called
   Mama Simba, which means mother of lions. I'm very excited to say that
   just in a few months, much shorter time than the warriors learned, the
   women... The women learned how to read very quickly. They're very
   excited about it. They monitor all the predators that come to their
   villages at night and they write down little notes about who's come and
   how many times they've come in a week. We did conservation training
   with the women. We taught them the importance of lions and predators
   and why conservation is so essential in this area. We showed them the
   different tracks because it's all the predators that come to visit them
   at their villages in the evenings. The women said to us we know the
   tracks, we know the difference between hyena and lion and leopard
   tracks but we've never actually seen these animals. We've never had a
   close-up encounter with a lion. We hear them at night, we see their
   tracks but we've never seen them. We said we're gonna change this.
   We're gonna take you all on safari so you can get to see what tourists
   from all over the world get to see.
   Here we are. We took all the women on safari into the beautiful Samburu
   National Reserve. And of course, the number one animal the women wanted
   to see were lions. We were a little worried because by 11:00 that
   morning we had seen nothing, actually, and the women kept saying to us,
   Where are the lions? Do they really exist? We know they exist because
   we hear them but you keep talking about them. Where are they? We worked
   really hard and we were very lucky. We managed to find two of our
   beautiful lionesses, Nanai and Nabulu, feeding on a baboon. The women
   were very excited watching this. At the time, Jeneria, my assistant, he
   was in another car. He had a lady next to him who had a little baby.
   The baby was getting a little bit agitated so he said to me he's gonna
   drive off and leave us with the lions, and he would let us know later
   where he is. About 10 minutes later he radioed me and he said,
   “Shivani, come quickly. Bring the women. Something amazing is
   happening.” I said, “What? What's more exciting than watching these
   lions eating a baboon.” He said, “Just come, trust me.” I told the
   women, “Hang on. We're gonna go drive to where Jeneria is.” And off we
   went, and we found him and right next to him was an elephant giving
   birth. It was an absolutely amazing experience. I have lived in Samburu
   for 12 years and I'd never seen this. What's even more incredible, is
   there's a relationship between Samburu women and elephants. As we
   watched this birth, the Samburu women in our cars were talking to the
   elephants. They were talking to them in Samburu. They were saying
   tomononi ai, which means-- It's an endearing way of talking to someone.
   They said, “We know you're in trouble, we know you and lions, you're
   all facing a lot of problems. Now we know and we're going to work hard
   to change that.” It was an incredible experience but word spread that
   we had shown a lot of women an elephant giving birth and we got
   messages from the community saying, Take us on Safari. We want to see
   elephants give birth. Took a lot of convincing to tell them, every time
   you go on safari in Samburu, you don't actually see an elephant give
   birth.
   Every year we hold Lion Kids Camps. Unfortunately, children in rural
   Kenya don't have positive experiences with wildlife. Most of their
   experiences are very negative. They get to see a cheetah killing a
   goat, they get to see the remains of a camel after a lion's preyed on
   it. They have never really experienced wildlife the way I was lucky to
   experience when I was a child. My parents took me on safari. I will
   never forget my first cheetah sighting, my first lion sighting. My
   first cheetah sighting happened to be in Samburu when I was just eight
   years old. That has stayed in my mind and that is why I do what I do.
   We have really invested in these children. We believe they are the
   future conservationists in this region. They are the future wardens,
   tour guides, rangers and just wildlife leaders. Our Kids Camp changes
   this. We bring wildlife to the children closeup. We give them a much
   more positive experience. Most of these children had actually never
   seen a lion so we show them lions. We bring them right next to these
   lions so they can get to see what people from all over the world get to
   see. These two little kids-- This picture was taken just a couple of
   weeks ago at our second annual Kids Camp. These little kids, Saiwana
   and Ltonos they were sitting next to me and they were saying, “We
   really can't wait to see our first lion, and we did.” We were actually
   very lucky. We saw 10 lions that day. At the back in the picture you'll
   see a little brown blob and that's actually a big male lion. These
   little kids saw him and their faces say it all. This is the first ever
   lion they've seen and they kept whispering to me, Simba, simba, and
   this is what gives us hope.
   Loirish is a lion we monitored in 2008. He was the father of many cubs
   in both Samburu and Buffalo Springs Reserves. He had control over two
   prides. Unfortunately, Loirish got into a lot of trouble last year. He
   was leaving the safety of the parks and going out and killing a lot of
   livestock. He killed more than 10 camels just in three months. We were
   very worried about this. We said we have to put a collar on him now and
   so we can really monitor his movements. Every time he leaves we will be
   able to see that he's out there approaching livestock, we could warn
   the herders. This is Letoiye, one of our warriors, and Loirish was his
   lion. He was looking after Loirish. Unfortunately we were not given
   much time. Loirish was killed last year in September. His head was cut
   off, his legs were cut off and his head was burned so they would remove
   the signs of the collar. Letoiye, who is in this picture, he for weeks
   was in camp saying to himself and talking to all of us saying, My
   warriors killed my lion. How could that have happened? I will make sure
   this doesn't happen again. This was devastating for our project but
   everyone was even more determined to make sure that our lions don't
   have the same fate that Loirish had.
   On a more hopeful note, Naramat who is a female that we hadn't seen for
   many years, for about three years. We were driving through Samburu last
   year. We heard the guinea fowl squawking. We knew there was a predator
   in the area and we saw this female. Jeneria and I, we know the lions
   very well. It takes us a couple of seconds to identify them but in this
   case we were stunned. We're like, Who is this lion? We pulled out our
   ID books, our iPads which has all the sketches of the lions, their
   ears, their whisker spots, and finally we identified her. We said, Wow
   this is Naramat. She left three years ago. Where has she been? This is
   where she's been. She had been outside the parks. She was surviving
   with the local people and what's even more exciting, she came back with
   a little male cub. A little one year old male cub who we named Lentim.
   This shows that lions do survive outside with the local people. I get
   asked this question a lot. “Is there a future for lions in Northern
   Kenya?” Absolutely there's a future. Our work has shown that. We had 11
   lions a decade ago and now we're monitoring over 50 lions in our area.
   It's because of the local people's involvement. With them invested in
   conservation, there's definitely a hope.
   We have an event which we have every year. It's the Running for Lions
   half marathon and now the local people are running in the name of
   lions. Every year the number of participants increase. I think they
   hear that the prizes are very exciting. It's prizes of goats. So the
   number of people keep coming and women too. For the last three years
   we've had more than 20 women come to run for lions.
   This is our camp, our field base camp in the Westgate Conservancy in
   Samburu. It's an open area, it's very remote. We have no running water,
   no power, no internet, no phones. We have wildlife walking through. We
   have one little animal that's not very wild. He's a little dog. Keeps
   us very well entertained in camp. It's in this camp seven years ago
   that we set up base. For many years we actually never heard lions in
   our camp but now over the past year, we can hear lions in our camp, and
   this is incredible. This is because they feel safer. The people are
   much more willing to live with lions, they're tolerant of them and now
   lions feel that. They feel safer and we can hear them at night. Today,
   I ask you. I ask you to support these initiatives that are ongoing in
   Africa, and to spread the word about the lion crisis. We then have hope
   that we will continue to hear lions throughout the African wilderness
   for generations to come.
   In Samburu we say ashe oleng. Thank you very much.
