Hanging Balloon Painting

   Pin It
   [PicMonkey+Collage2.jpg]
   It was Little B's 2nd birthday so we had balloons around.
   I hung some up under the deck stairs outside to let the boys paint them
   with washable paint.

   They had SO MUCH FUN with this! Not only did they paint the balloons,
   but there was lots of spinning, batting, kicking, punching...it ended
   up to be a gross motor activity for sure.
   [2.jpg]
   At first Little B was frustrated because the balloon kept moving away
   from him when he tried to paint it (which was really funny to watch
   actually lol) He figured out how to get a good grip on it while bending
   over to get the paint and then keep a hold of it while painting.
   Toddler problem solving!

   L liked to get a bunch of paint on his hand and then spin the balloon
   to completely cover it with paint.

   By the end, they looked like this...which is pretty much the norm
   around here.
   Although that red all over is a bit unnerving haha! :)

Homemade Washable Face Paints

   Pin It
   Homemade Washable Face Paint
   The boys had so much fun painting their faces (and arms..and legs..and
   feet) with very
     easily washable face paint
   Recipe for Washable Face Paints
   Baby Lotion + Washable Paint (liquid or powdered tempura works too)
   + Dishwashing Soap   (and it isn't an exact science)
   OR
   2 tablespoons Cold Cream + 4 tablespoons Cornstarch + Washable Paint
   _______________________________________________________________________
   __________
   I've tried both and they both work great! If you go with the 2nd
   recipe, just buy the cheaper generic white cold cream. Pictured below
   is the first recipe.  I put some lotion into each bowl, added a 1/2
   teaspoon or so of powdered tempura paint, and 1 squirt of dish soap
   then stirred. If your going to use liquid tempura or washable paints
   such as Crayola, there won't be much difference in texture except maybe
   it wont be as thick. You can add a bit of cornstarch to thicken if
   needed. It can be easily removed with soap and water, just try to keep
   it away from the eyes. It's not tear free.
   Easily Washable Homemade Face Paint
   I set the boys up outside with their own mirrors and and brushes. My
   oldest was fine with the instruction to keep it out of his eyes, but I
   kept a closer watch over little B.

      A beautiful mess!

Concoctions and Potions Themed Birthday Party

   Pin It
   [PicMonkey+Collage.jpg]
   I threw a "Concoctions and Potions" themed party for L and B's joint
   birthday party.
   This party was so crazy simple to put together, but it turned out to be
   a HUGE hit!  It really was incredible how long the kids were into this
   activity..HOURS of mixing and pouring and creating their concoctions!
   I raided my sensory collection and kitchen
   for all the concoction ingredients such as
   Colored and Scented Rice
   Colored and Scented Epsom Salt
   Waterbeads
   Shredded Paper
   Coffee Grinds and Coffee Beans
   Koolaid Colored Ice Cubes
   Glitter
   Dry Beans
   Dry Noodles
   About an hour into the activity, I brought out the
   SECRET INGREDIENTS...
   Baking Soda and Vinegar!
   I put lots of baking soda into a big bowl and vinegar into squeezy
   bottles so when the kids added the baking soda to their concoctions and
   then squeezed in some vinegar, their concoctions bubbled and fizzed!
   THIS WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE PARTY!
   I made sure I laid out  lots of different sized bowls, cups, spoons,
   measuring cups, droppers, pots and pans, etc.

   Giving instead of receiving gifts
   We started a new birthday tradition a few years ago where instead of
   party guests bringing gifts, I choose a charity close to our hearts and
   gently ask our guests to bring donations. This year we chose the non
   profit organization Art Feeds, which is a mobile arts program based out
   of Joplin, MO which brings fun and free art classes to elementary
   students and schools who have undergone trauma. I am always SO very
   impressed and thankful of how generous our party guests are each year
   with these donations! In the previous years we've asked for donations
   to The Northwest Arkansas Children Shelter and our local Animal
   Shelter. This is a tradition we have come to love and my oldest son is
   so amazing and thoughtful about it. We always talk about the charity we
   are giving to and I make sure he understands how important giving to
   their cause is.
    He has never complained about not receiving "gifts" at his party and
   he has come to love this tradition of giving instead of receiving :) It
   is a tradition we will no doubt continue!

Birthday Sensory Bin

   Pin It
   [PicMonkey+Collage.jpg]
   I made a Birthday Sensory Bin as one of the homemade gifts for my son's
   5th birthday.
   I used rainbow rice mixed with confetti as the filler, and then threw
   in other dollar store birthday supplies.
   It was so colorful, festive, and fun!
