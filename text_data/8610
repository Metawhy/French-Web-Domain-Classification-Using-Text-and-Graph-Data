   Jennifer Francis earned a B.S. in Meteorology from San Jose State
   University in 1988 and a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from the
   University of Washington in 1994. As a professor at Rutgers University
   since 1994, she taught courses in satellite remote sensing and
   climate-change issues, and also co-founded and co-directed the Rutgers
   Climate and Environmental Change Initiative. Presently she is a
   Research Professor with the Rutgers Institute of Marine and Coastal
   Sciences and studies Arctic climate change and Arctic-global climate
   linkages with ~40 peer-reviewed publications on these topics. During
   the 13 months from July 2009-July 2010, her family of four spent a year
   sailing through Central America. She and her husband circumnavigated
   the world in a sailboat from 1980-1985, including Cape Horn and the
   Arctic, which is when she first became interested in Arctic weather and
   climate.

Rutgers Climate Institute

   climate change square

   The Rutgers Climate Institute is a University-wide effort to address
   one of the most important issues of our time through research,
   education and outreach. The Institute draws upon strengths in many
   departments at Rutgers facilitating collaboration across a broad range
   of disciplines in the natural and social sciences, the humanities,
   engineering, law, and medicine.

   Our faculty affiliates are scholars whose research effects areas as
   close to home as the Raritan River and Jersey Shore, and as far as
   Africa and Indonesia. A key aspect of RCI's work is public outreach,
   education and service to New Jersey. The Institute regularly hosts
   events on climate change topics of interest open to the public as well
   as the Rutgers community featuring notable climate scientists and
   international, federal, and state policy-makers, journalists, and
   authors.
