glTF Overview

   glTF

Runtime 3D Asset Delivery

   glTF™ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the
   efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by
   applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the
   runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines
   an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and
   services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable
   use of content across the industry.

Participate in the glTF Community

   glTF is run as an open project by Khronos. The specification,
   supporting materials and source code is developed and made
   freely available on GitHub.

   Everyone is welcome to contribute to the code and provide feedback
   about the specification; you do not have to be a Khronos member to
   participate in the glTF community. Visit the "Ways to contribute to
   glTF" page in main glTF project on GitHub.

glTF Demo

   ‘Project “Polly” was produced to introduce all new features from glTF
   2.0: Skinning, morphing and Physically Based materials are used in the
   demo. ‘Poly’ was developed using Blender and is used to test its glTF
   2.0 exporter. The original Blender file will be provided to the glTF
   community for free!’

                            WebGL Extension Registry

Overview

   The WebGL extension registry contains specifications for extensions to
   the core WebGL API. Most of these extensions are incorporated directly
   from the OpenGL ES or OpenGL extension registries, and refer to those
   extensions for their behavioral definition. Because WebGL extensions
   are specified as Web IDL interfaces, each specification also includes
   the IDL to which each implementation will comply.

   An extension template is available for the submission of new proposed
   extensions. New extension proposals should be emailed to the public
   WebGL mailing list. When writing a new extension specification, it is
   recommended to check out the public WebGL repository. See the WebGL
   wiki page Using Github to contribute. The extension registry files are
   located under extensions/.

   Each extension object is fetched from the WebGLRenderingContextBase by
   passing the name of the extension to the getExtension method, i.e.:
   context.getExtension("OES_texture_float").

   Extensions which are marked as promoted to core or removed in a certain
   version of the WebGL API must not be supported in an implementation of
   that or newer version of the WebGL API.

Naming conventions

   WebGL API extensions may derive from many sources, and the naming of
   each extension reflects its origin and intent.
     * ARB, OES and KHR tags should be used for mirroring functionality
       from OpenGL ES or OpenGL API extensions approved by the respective
       architecture review boards. EXT_ and GPU vendor tags should be used
       for mirroring other OpenGL ES or OpenGL API extensions. If only
       small differences in behavior compared to OpenGL ES or OpenGL are
       specified for a given extension, the original tag should be
       maintained.
     * The WEBGL tag should be used for WebGL-specific extensions which
       are intended to be compatible with multiple web browsers. It should
       also be used for extensions which originated with the OpenGL ES or
       OpenGL APIs, but whose behavior has been significantly altered.
     * Browser vendor specific tags should be used for WebGL-specific
       extensions that are intended to run only on a particular browser.
       It is recommended to avoid such extensions, and instead specify
       them with the WEBGL tag.

Extension Development Process

   Extensions move through four states during their development: proposed,
   draft, community approved, and Khronos ratified. Every extension should
   advance to Khronos ratified. If an extension cannot advance through the
   extension process it can be rejected.
     * Proposed extensions are intended for discussion on the public WebGL
       mailing list, in order to move to draft status; they should not be
       implemented, even under a vendor prefix. If consensus is reached in
       the community, the extension can be moved to draft status.
     * Draft extensions may be implemented under a vendor prefix or behind
       a run-time option for experimentation purposes, in order to gain
       experience with the extension before finalizing it. Draft
       extensions should not be exposed by default by WebGL
       implementations. Once consensus is reached in the community, the
       extension can be moved to community approved status.
     * Community approved extensions should be implemented without a
       vendor prefix. When a draft extension moves to community approved
       status, any existing implementation should immediately remove
       support for any vendor-prefixed extension name. Once implemented by
       a vendor, support should not be removed unless there is a serious
       issue with the extension, such as a security flaw.
     * Khronos ratified extensions are those community approved extensions
       which have been voted upon by the Khronos Board of Promoters.
     * Rejected extensions should never be implemented. An extension
       enters rejected status because consensus on it could not be reached
       at the proposal stage or technical difficulties arise during
       implementation at the draft stage. A community approved extension
       can only be rejected in extraordinary circumstances. A Khronos
       ratified extension cannot be rejected.

Unified programming with oneAPI from Intel and SYCL from Khronos

       September 24, 2019 SYCL

   A unified programming model offers enterprises and OEMs a
   cost-effectively way to take advantage of the growing diversity of
   processor platforms, letting companies share their source code
   investment across vendors and architectures. Enter oneAPI from Intel,
   which aims to revolutionize application development through a unified,
   open development model to simplify programming across processors. Intel
   built upon C++, and SYCL from The Khronos Group had some really good
   constructs that they thought provided a very good starting point. Intel
   extended and improved it to achieve the goals that they wanted to
   achieve. Most of the DPC++ extensions will eventually be synced
   upstream into SYCL.

glTF Overview

   glTF

Runtime 3D Asset Delivery

   glTF™ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the
   efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by
   applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the
   runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines
   an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and
   services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable
   use of content across the industry.

Participate in the glTF Community

   glTF is run as an open project by Khronos. The specification,
   supporting materials and source code is developed and made
   freely available on GitHub.

   Everyone is welcome to contribute to the code and provide feedback
   about the specification; you do not have to be a Khronos member to
   participate in the glTF community. Visit the "Ways to contribute to
   glTF" page in main glTF project on GitHub.

glTF Demo

   ‘Project “Polly” was produced to introduce all new features from glTF
   2.0: Skinning, morphing and Physically Based materials are used in the
   demo. ‘Poly’ was developed using Blender and is used to test its glTF
   2.0 exporter. The original Blender file will be provided to the glTF
   community for free!’

                            WebGL Extension Registry

Overview

   The WebGL extension registry contains specifications for extensions to
   the core WebGL API. Most of these extensions are incorporated directly
   from the OpenGL ES or OpenGL extension registries, and refer to those
   extensions for their behavioral definition. Because WebGL extensions
   are specified as Web IDL interfaces, each specification also includes
   the IDL to which each implementation will comply.

   An extension template is available for the submission of new proposed
   extensions. New extension proposals should be emailed to the public
   WebGL mailing list. When writing a new extension specification, it is
   recommended to check out the public WebGL repository. See the WebGL
   wiki page Using Github to contribute. The extension registry files are
   located under extensions/.

   Each extension object is fetched from the WebGLRenderingContextBase by
   passing the name of the extension to the getExtension method, i.e.:
   context.getExtension("OES_texture_float").

   Extensions which are marked as promoted to core or removed in a certain
   version of the WebGL API must not be supported in an implementation of
   that or newer version of the WebGL API.

Naming conventions

   WebGL API extensions may derive from many sources, and the naming of
   each extension reflects its origin and intent.
     * ARB, OES and KHR tags should be used for mirroring functionality
       from OpenGL ES or OpenGL API extensions approved by the respective
       architecture review boards. EXT_ and GPU vendor tags should be used
       for mirroring other OpenGL ES or OpenGL API extensions. If only
       small differences in behavior compared to OpenGL ES or OpenGL are
       specified for a given extension, the original tag should be
       maintained.
     * The WEBGL tag should be used for WebGL-specific extensions which
       are intended to be compatible with multiple web browsers. It should
       also be used for extensions which originated with the OpenGL ES or
       OpenGL APIs, but whose behavior has been significantly altered.
     * Browser vendor specific tags should be used for WebGL-specific
       extensions that are intended to run only on a particular browser.
       It is recommended to avoid such extensions, and instead specify
       them with the WEBGL tag.

Extension Development Process

   Extensions move through four states during their development: proposed,
   draft, community approved, and Khronos ratified. Every extension should
   advance to Khronos ratified. If an extension cannot advance through the
   extension process it can be rejected.
     * Proposed extensions are intended for discussion on the public WebGL
       mailing list, in order to move to draft status; they should not be
       implemented, even under a vendor prefix. If consensus is reached in
       the community, the extension can be moved to draft status.
     * Draft extensions may be implemented under a vendor prefix or behind
       a run-time option for experimentation purposes, in order to gain
       experience with the extension before finalizing it. Draft
       extensions should not be exposed by default by WebGL
       implementations. Once consensus is reached in the community, the
       extension can be moved to community approved status.
     * Community approved extensions should be implemented without a
       vendor prefix. When a draft extension moves to community approved
       status, any existing implementation should immediately remove
       support for any vendor-prefixed extension name. Once implemented by
       a vendor, support should not be removed unless there is a serious
       issue with the extension, such as a security flaw.
     * Khronos ratified extensions are those community approved extensions
       which have been voted upon by the Khronos Board of Promoters.
     * Rejected extensions should never be implemented. An extension
       enters rejected status because consensus on it could not be reached
       at the proposal stage or technical difficulties arise during
       implementation at the draft stage. A community approved extension
       can only be rejected in extraordinary circumstances. A Khronos
       ratified extension cannot be rejected.

Unified programming with oneAPI from Intel and SYCL from Khronos

       September 24, 2019 SYCL

   A unified programming model offers enterprises and OEMs a
   cost-effectively way to take advantage of the growing diversity of
   processor platforms, letting companies share their source code
   investment across vendors and architectures. Enter oneAPI from Intel,
   which aims to revolutionize application development through a unified,
   open development model to simplify programming across processors. Intel
   built upon C++, and SYCL from The Khronos Group had some really good
   constructs that they thought provided a very good starting point. Intel
   extended and improved it to achieve the goals that they wanted to
   achieve. Most of the DPC++ extensions will eventually be synced
   upstream into SYCL.

Participation

       November 13, 2019 exploratory, analyticrendering

   The Khronos Group has issued a call for participation in the newly
   formed Analytic Rendering Exploratory Group. The group has been formed
   to discuss the standardization of an Analytic Rendering API for data
   visualization. All interested parties are invited to participate, with
   no cost or IP obligations, to share perspectives, requirements and use
   cases to help determine whether there is an industry need for such an
   API and to help set the direction for any standardization activities.
   Learn more about what Analytic Rendering is why a new analytic
   rendering API is needed and what the goals of such a group might look
   like. If your company, or a company you know is interested in learning
   more and joining the Exploratory Group, you are invited to contact us.
