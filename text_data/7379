   Have you ever wondered what a friend would do if she was in your
   decision-making situation? Or thought about where a family member might
   go if he was visiting a travel destination with you? In many cases, you
   can only guess what a person would do if they were in your shoes. But
   now you may be able to securely "borrow their  identity" and ask a
   question with the confidence of receiving a relevant and  valuable
   answer.

   Can software agents become our digital heirs? Can a head of state, a
   scientist, or a business owner leverage machine intelligence to
   complement succession planning?  What if you could select the digital
   identity of a deceased person from a social network and activate it as
   a pluggable ontology into your iPhone’s Siri and ask a question?

   Our digital identity has become so rich and intrinsic that without it,
   it may feel like a part of us is missing. The number of sensors we
   carry daily and the digital footprints we leave behind have given us
   enough granular patterns and data clusters that we can now use them for
   prediction and reasoning on behalf of an individual. We believe that…

   enough granular patterns and data clusters that we can now use them for

   enabling our digital identity to perpetuate, we can significantly
   contribute to global expertise and enable a new form of an
   intergenerational collective intelligence.

   Example of Augmented Eternity App V1.0 - Users can activate a persona
   from a trust network
   Credit: Hossein Rahnama

   This project uses a distributed machine intelligence network to enable
   its users to control their growing digital footprint, turn it into
   their digital representation, and share it as a part of a social
   network. The project creates an evolving ontological mapping of an
   individual based on her digital interactions and allows the person to
   represent her aggregated knowledge-base in form of a software agent.
   This agent can then be rendered as a chatbot or a voice-based
   assistant. The project is aiming to open-source a number of "identity
   render kits" to enable users to quickly share their knowledge base
   within a trust network.

   Augmented Eternity-LENSE - Ability to view the world from other
   peoples' point of view
   Credit: Hossein Rahnama

   For example, a corporate lawyer can provide her expertise to a network
   of clients for a reduced cost compared to her classic in-person rate
   sheet.  Her clients in this case have the ability to "borrow the
   identity" of the lawyer for an hour and consult it as a chatbot. Our
   machine intelligence framework will learn from each interaction and
   respond to the user with a high degree of relevance.

   Research in this project is based on “Borrowable Identities” in which
   users can share a subset of their digitized identity within a social
   network to advance collective intelligence. Each share can result in
   different incentive models and is governed by the semantics and
   policies of the trust network.

   Contextual Inference Network - Green Nodes are Inference Nodes using
   Neural Networks, Bayesian Belief Network and Causal Inference

   This initiative is combining expertise from context aware computing,
   machine intelligence, and Mobile HCI to build intuitive and learnable
   tools that enable the design and adoption of such expert systems. Our
   interest in this project is to develop psychological and socially
   inspired approaches to better understand and predict human behavior in
   dynamic contextual environments. Characterizing real-time semantics in
   such settings is a challenging problem and it provides an opportunity
   for the machine intelligence and semantic computing communities to
   develop new methodologies to address it. We contribute to these
   communities through our work on hybrid machine intelligence frameworks
   that rely on causal inference and machine learning techniques including
   Bayesian networks. The purpose of this work is to learn from humans'
   daily lives; rather than using it for advertising purposes, we use it
   for the advancement of the world's collective intelligence. Interface
   design and ergonomics are inherent components of this research project,
   as we believe  such systems are only successful if they are adopted and
   used by large groups of people.

   Have you ever wondered what a friend would do if she was in your
   decision-making situation? Or thought about where a family member might
   go if he was visiting a travel destination with you? In many cases, you
   can only guess what a person would do if they were in your shoes. But
   now you may be able to securely "borrow their  identity" and ask a
   question with the confidence of receiving a relevant and  valuable
   answer.

   Can software agents become our digital heirs? Can a head of state, a
   scientist, or a business owner leverage machine intelligence to
   complement succession planning?  What if you could select the digital
   identity of a deceased person from a social network and activate it as
   a pluggable ontology into your iPhone’s Siri and ask a question?

   Our digital identity has become so rich and intrinsic that without it,
   it may feel like a part of us is missing. The number of sensors we
   carry daily and the digital footprints we leave behind have given us
   enough granular patterns and data clusters that we can now use them for

   enough granular patterns and data clusters that we can now use them for

   enabling our digital identity to perpetuate, we can significantly
   contribute to global expertise and enable a new form of an
   intergenerational collective intelligence.

   Example of Augmented Eternity App V1.0 - Users can activate a persona
   from a trust network
   Credit: Hossein Rahnama

   This project uses a distributed machine intelligence network to enable
   its users to control their growing digital footprint, turn it into
   their digital representation, and share it as a part of a social
   network. The project creates an evolving ontological mapping of an
   individual based on her digital interactions and allows the person to
   represent her aggregated knowledge-base in form of a software agent.
   This agent can then be rendered as a chatbot or a voice-based
   assistant. The project is aiming to open-source a number of "identity
   render kits" to enable users to quickly share their knowledge base
   within a trust network.

   Augmented Eternity-LENSE - Ability to view the world from other
   peoples' point of view
   Credit: Hossein Rahnama

   For example, a corporate lawyer can provide her expertise to a network
   of clients for a reduced cost compared to her classic in-person rate
   sheet.  Her clients in this case have the ability to "borrow the
   identity" of the lawyer for an hour and consult it as a chatbot. Our
   machine intelligence framework will learn from each interaction and
   respond to the user with a high degree of relevance.

   Research in this project is based on “Borrowable Identities” in which
   users can share a subset of their digitized identity within a social
   network to advance collective intelligence. Each share can result in
   different incentive models and is governed by the semantics and
   policies of the trust network.

   Contextual Inference Network - Green Nodes are Inference Nodes using
   Neural Networks, Bayesian Belief Network and Causal Inference

   This initiative is combining expertise from context aware computing,
   machine intelligence, and Mobile HCI to build intuitive and learnable
   tools that enable the design and adoption of such expert systems. Our
   interest in this project is to develop psychological and socially
   inspired approaches to better understand and predict human behavior in
   dynamic contextual environments. Characterizing real-time semantics in
   such settings is a challenging problem and it provides an opportunity
   for the machine intelligence and semantic computing communities to
   develop new methodologies to address it. We contribute to these
   communities through our work on hybrid machine intelligence frameworks
   that rely on causal inference and machine learning techniques including
   Bayesian networks. The purpose of this work is to learn from humans'
   daily lives; rather than using it for advertising purposes, we use it
   for the advancement of the world's collective intelligence. Interface
   design and ergonomics are inherent components of this research project,
   as we believe  such systems are only successful if they are adopted and
   used by large groups of people.
