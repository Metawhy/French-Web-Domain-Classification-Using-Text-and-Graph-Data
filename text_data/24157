The Story Behind The Bright Orange Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn

   Among a sea of rubber-necking passersby, a woman from Bulgaria stops
   dead in her tracks, and some Polish men in a van slow to crawl.
   Eventually a dark-colored Porsche Cayenne rolls up and its windows
   rolls down slowly, revealing a young man originally from Moscow with
   many questions. All approach the car as one would an estranged,
   childhood friend.

   This morning Kyle told us about an attack walrus—which is like a SEAL
   but bigger—which fought and successfully took down a Russian boat. The
   walrus, who may have taken down dozens more inflatable boats in the
   past, was never captured. Some have an idea who the suspect might be,
   but there is not enough proof to convict.

   There was a brief moment in the early 1990s when all of the major

   what it cost to run a Formula 1 team, only F1 had much more air time

   they went off their own separate ways once the shared architecture was

   convenient place.

   Toyota says the 2020 Supra feels different to drive than its mechanical
   twin, the 2020 BMW Z4 M40i. Actually, since the start, both carmakers
   have been hammering about how distinguished each car is, telling us
   they went off their own separate ways once the shared architecture was
   laid out.

   I’ve been tracking this BMW-Toyota love affair for quite a while now.
   It began with me driving the new Z4 in its four-cylinder trim last
   winter down in Palm Springs, a car BMW calls the Z4 SDrive30i. I liked
   it quite a lot.

   Then, I drove the G20 3 Series sedan, and finally, this, the Supra and
   Z4. They all feel very similar, to be honest. But since the very
   beginning, everyone has wondered which company wore this engine and
   platform best.

   2020 Toyota Supra

   Having these two globalized car-siblings in my driveway confirmed an
   important question: is the Supra still a Supra even if it’s not... a
   Toyota? Or, perhaps, more importantly, are these twins really all that
   different?

   (Full disclosure: The opportunity to drive both the 2020 BMW Z4 M40i
   and the 2020 Toyota GR Supra came up when work colleague Vincent Aubé
   and I joined forces to do a comparo. BMW and Toyota Canada agreed,
   and prepared us clean cars with a full tank of gas.)

What Are They?

   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The return of the Supra has arguably been one of most talked about
   automotive topics this year, at least among enthusiasts. After all, the
   last-generation Supra, also known as the MKIV, garnered itself a
   legendary reputation in the tuner car world even before starring in The
   Fast and the Furious and an exorbitant amount of street racing videos.
   The Supra is the poster child of 1990s Japanese performance.

The 2020 Toyota Supra Is Not What We Expected but It Is Very Good

   For Toyota to announce the return of its halo sports car 20 years after
   it died is a big deal, especially when also announcing there will be no
   manual gearbox and that the car’s heart won’t even be Japanese.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   To be fair, a partnership like this BMW-Toyota one actually makes a lot
   of sense from a business standpoint, especially in our current era,
   where sports car sales are in the toilet and electrified crossovers
   will soon rule the roads.

   I’m told the initial idea for the joint-venture came from Toyota, which
   put the most amount of money on the table for it to happen and wanted
   the Supra to have a straight-six like it used to. Meanwhile, BMW got a
   new roadster in the deal, and one they hoped would be more competitive
   with the Porsche Boxster and Cayman than ever before.

The 2019 BMW Z4 Isnʼt a Hardcore Sports Car, but Hereʼs Why Thatʼs Okay

   Production of both cars would be subcontracted by the Magna Steyr
   automobile manufacturer in Graz, Austria, alongside the BMW 5 Series
   and other German vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Both cars share BMW’s new modular, CLAR platform, as well as a
   BMW-sourced turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six mated to a ZF
   eight-speed automatic gearbox. In both cases, power is sent to the rear
   wheels only.

   From a mechanical standpoint, the Supra and the Z4, or what some have
   taken to calling the Zupra, are indeed quite identical. Tire, wheel and
   brake sizes, all the same. Pop the hood, and even the finest details
   are carbon copies of one another.

   The differences lie in tuning, engineers say—of the suspension, engine,
   exhaust note and more. Toyota’s folks will tell you they got the
   hardware and figured things out from there. It’s entirely possible they
   feel different to drive; the question is how much?
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The end result is still rather interesting, spawning two completely
   different types of very capable sports cars, aimed at entirely unique
   demographics. One is a luxury two-seat roadster, the other is a sports
   coupe. The Z4 can be powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder,
   something the Supra currently only offers in other markets. The Z4 has
   more options, while the Supra comes in one all-inclusive package.

   Also, between the two press units that lied in my driveway, there was a
   $16,000 CAN ($12,000 US) price gap.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   BMW claims its more-expensive Z4 M40i, the most powerful and potent
   variant, pumps out 381 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque while
   weighing in at 3,622 pounds.

   The Supra, on the other hand, puts down a promised 335 horsepower and
   365 torques at 3,397 pounds. However, some dyno tests have revealed
   even higher numbers, suggesting the Toyota actually generates north of
   400 lb-ft of torque. BMW’s infamous for underrating engines, so I do
   suspect both are really more powerful than initial numbers would have
   you believe.

Why Do They Matter?

   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Many would like to know which of these two carmakers calibrated this
   platform the best. Perhaps, more obvious than that, is the
   fifth-generation Toyota Supra any good?

   One thing’s for certain: Toyota needed a Supra in its portfolio. While
   the brand has been working hard lately at shedding its boring-beige
   reputation with fun cars like the 86, the manual-gearbox Corolla
   hatchback, Lexus models with some edge, and quite a few solid offerings
   for off-road enthusiasts, it still hasn’t had a top-shelf sports car
   since the last Supra left us in 1997.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Also, with the Nissan GT-R’s refusal to die and the return of the Acura
   NSX, plus Mazda plugging away with the always-great MX-5 Miata, Toyota
   kind of had to hop back into the mix.

   BMW, on the other hand, didn’t really need a new Z4, per se. It’s been
   doing fine selling M cars and high-performance variants of pretty much
   everything it sells, including its ever-expanding lineup of SUVs.

   Also, with the Mercedes-Benz SLC now gone as well as an unknown future
   for the Audi TT, or the we-might-as-well-pronounce-it-dead Alfa Romeo
   4C, the small premium roadster segment isn’t exactly flourishing at the
   moment. A fresh new Z4, however, allows BMW to be alone in that niche
   with the Boxster. And if there’s anything we know about BMW these days,
   its motto may be Leave No Niche Behind.

   Because it’s the car that generates the most amount of excitement, both
   online and on the street, I’m going to begin with the Supra.

   Its styling is a much more in-your-face effort than the Z4’s, with its
   curves, bulging arches and duckbill spoiler hanging out the back. This
   is a car that wants your attention and does a rather good job grabbing
   it.

   My tester was painted in the Absolute Zero white paint job, which
   looked quite dashing with the contrasting red-on-black interior. As a
   matter of fact, everywhere we drove it, people went nuts over this
   thing.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Inside, it’s mostly a copy and paste of BMW’s latest dashboard layouts.
   The Supra does, however, incorporate its own little design cues like
   air vents and gauge readouts. Also, SUPRA! logos here and there remind
   you what you’re driving.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   But let’s not get too carried away here. The entire center console,
   HVAC controls, and shifter are taken straight out of the Z4. So is the
   iDrive infotainment interface which Toyota adorably tried to change
   with different colors and images of tiny Supras.

   Otherwise, it’s the exact same system as in all current-generation BMW
   cars and SUVs. It still can’t connect to Android Auto, but other than
   that iDrive is good. Probably one of the best right now.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Supra’s cabin is visibly more confined than the Z4’s, with an
   aggressive roofline that’s not exactly kind to big guys like me. I kept
   having to lower my head to look outside the car, and banged it a few
   times getting in. I did enjoy the seats, though. Supportive during hard
   driving and comfortable for long trips.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   I had a peculiar problem driving the Supra with its windows lowered.
   Turbulence was intense at freeway speeds, so bad, in fact, that I ended
   up running the car with the AC on most of the time.

   My hypothesis is that the problem comes from the enormous pass-through
   located behind the seats. It’s a handy feature to throw your junk in
   the trunk from the driver’s seat. But it seems to create some kind of a
   venturi effect when the windows are dropped.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   On the road, the Supra feels immediately more urgent and playful than
   the Z4. It’s audibly louder and more alive as well, spooling its turbo
   and emitting healthy belches out its twin exhaust. Power kicks in
   quick, with very little appreciable lag, especially for a turbocharged
   engine.

   In case you’re still not aware, the GR badge refers to Gazoo Racing,
   Toyota’s latest motorsports arm. The outfit basically tuned, calibrated
   and tested the entire car.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   There’s only one extra drive mode in the Supra, and it’s Sport, which
   firms up the adaptive dampers, shifts more aggressively and adds some
   resistance to the steering wheel.

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   In Sport, all the character traits listed above become even more
   apparent, requiring you to be quite awake behind the wheel. It’s a wild
   car, feeling indeed much more powerful than its 335-HP engine suggests.
   It’s also a stunningly loud machine when Sport Mode is engaged.

   So I’m calling it here and now: the Supra is undoubtedly the more fun
   car to drive.

   And yet I don’t know if it’s because I’m getting old, or because I
   wanted to work on my tan, but I much preferred the Z4 over the Supra.

BMW Z4 M40i

   The thing is, even though it’s considerably more expensive, the Z4
   feels like a more complete car. It’s almost as if BMW kept all the good
   stuff for itself.

   For instance, its interior is noticeably more spacious and comfortable
   than in the Toyota. One, because, yes, you can drive it with the top
   down; an added bonus during a warm Autumn day.

   But also because once its quick-retracting soft top is put back into
   place, there’s still massive headroom in the cabin.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The seats are also plushier, with leg extenders you don’t get in the
   other car. Interior design is all BMW, with BMW’s own switchgear, so
   the entire cabin feels more genuine and upscale, with finer-feeling
   materials. I also didn’t have to deal with that stupid wind problem
   during open-air driving.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Z4 doesn’t have the Supra’s handy pass-through between its seats,
   there’s only a tiny opening the size of an iPad to access the trunk,
   but total cargo space remains high, almost identical to its hatchback
   sister, actually.

   The Z4 gives way to 9.9 cubic feet versus 10.1 cubes in the Supra.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Z4 not only looks more mature than its Japanese-tuned brother, but
   it also drives in a much more grown-up manner. Not that the car isn’t
   attractive, because it is. I’m personally a fan of its slim LED
   taillights, they remind me of the BMW Z8 roadster from the early 2000s.

   It does end up feeling more anonymous as a result. Next to the Supra,
   the Z4 simply disappears, appearing like some other snob, expensive
   convertible, and at times seeming to share proportions with a
   Mercedes-Benz SL.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   From behind the wheel, things are much more toned down, civilized, yet
   equally athletic. The Z4 doesn’t wag its tail under hard acceleration
   like the Supra, but rather squats down and burns a bit of rubber as it
   charges forward with a good, strong rush of power.

   It generally feels like a larger, heavier automobile, with a
   significantly less wild exhaust note and a more controlled ride.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   What the Z4 lacks in flamboyance, it makes up for with greater drive
   mode flexibility, allowing it to be a more enjoyable daily driver. For
   instance, while the Supra only has one alternate mode, the Z4 has a
   total of five, ranging from Sport, Sport +, Comfort, EcoPro and
   Adaptive, which automatically adapts to your driving style.

   All modes actually change the car’s character to surprisingly great
   lengths.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Another feature I preferred in the BMW, was the ability to shove the
   gearbox in automatic S mode, where it still does the shifting for you,
   but in a more aggressive manner than D.

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   The Supra doesn’t offer this, it simply goes from D to manual mode.
   Yes, its Sport mode takes care of that for you, but you can’t opt for a
   quick transmission and a soft, comfortable ride, for instance.

   Fun fact: after driving this Z4, I spent some time behind the wheel of
   a 2020 BMW M4 convertible. It felt like a slow, heavy dinosaur next to
   this. That’s how fresh and modern that new CLAR platform feels, and how
   quick the Z4 M40i is.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   For the sake of this comparo, we had arranged some track time over at
   Sanair where we could properly assess acceleration times, braking, and
   overall lap performance for each car.

   While Toyota eagerly accepted to let us bring the Supra at the track,
   BMW backed away at the last minute due to insurance-related issues. So
   we couldn’t get real numbers down. However, judging from our seat of
   the pants experience, Vincent and I both agreed that the Supra felt
   like the faster car.

Verdict

   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   There’s no denying that both the 2020 Toyota GR Supra and the 2020 BMW
   Z4 M40i are the same car. But they are good cars. Their origins don’t
   in any way detract from the driving experiences they offer.

   If anything, these two are up there among the most potent performance
   machines available for under $100,000 (please don’t make Corvette C8
   jokes).

   And the great thing is, they do feel different!
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Supra is definitely aimed at a younger, more driving-oriented
   buyer, and it does a fantastic job fulfilling that mission. If you
   haven’t driven recent BMW products, walk inside a Toyota dealer and ask
   to test drive a Supra, you’re not going to be disappointed. It’s one
   hell of a sports car, and you’ll be getting a lot of performance for
   your dollar.

   But if you know your cars, if not just a tad, you know the differences
   between driving a Toyota and driving a BMW. This Supra doesn’t drive,
   sound, or even smell like a Toyota.

   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The

   So in that sense, no, the 2020 Toyota Supra doesn’t compare to its
   predecessor because it’s not a true Japanese effort. It’s too different
   in too many ways. The fourth-generation car had been developed to, yes,
   satisfy enthusiasts, but also to showcase Toyota’s engineering know-how
   against the world, most notably the German carmakers.

   Now, it’s the Germans that build the damn thing.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Z4, on the other hand, arrived in the ring quiet and humble,
   overshadowed by the hype the Supra had created. It ended up being the
   car I enjoyed driving the most, either because it offers more as a car,
   but also because it feels like a genuine BMW effort.

   If there’s a higher-level takeaway here, it might be that there should
   be an unwritten rule in the automotive industry: never outsource your
   halo car.

   Those are the automobiles that attract people into your showroom, the
   “hey, look what we can do” vehicle that convinces buyers to buy that
   RAV4 because it shares components with the sports car.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   That doesn’t really apply here. As much fun as the new Supra is, its
   greatness isn’t something Toyota can truly claim for itself.

This Startup's Electric Van Is A Packaging Triumph

   Packaging Triumph

   One of the biggest advantages of electric vehicles is that they can
   potentially have far more packaging flexibility than combustion-engine
   cars. Companies have been taking advantage of this, as you can see in
   Tesla’s twin-trunk designs and Volkswagen’s volume-maximizing reborn
   electric Microbus. A startup called Canoo is taking a similar approach
   as VW, with an EV that’s a clever study in the maximization of interior
   volume. You know, a van.

   Though it’s not autonomous, though the company says they’re working on
   that, the room-on-wheels design is exactly what future autonomous
   vehicles should be (there may be a book out that says just that) and
   even in its current, human-driven form, the design looks incredibly
   flexible and usable.

   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   The Canoo was designed by Richard Kim, the designer behind BMW’s very
   innovative i3 and the sleek i8, and while there are clear similarities
   to Kim’s earlier designs, the Canoo shows a much purer design, an
   unashamed, streamlined, heavily-windowed box on a skateboard, an
   envelope that surrounds a very versatile and appealing interior.

   The front and rear profiles of the Canoo are just about identical; were
   it not for the position of the rear-view mirrors and colors of the
   lights, it would be hard to tell which end was front and which was the
   rear. It’s sort of like a very modernized VW Bus, or perhaps even an
   enlarged and updated Zündapp Janus.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A

   The rear of the vehicle has a U-shaped bench seat, with what appears to
   be seat belts for three passengers. There’s also some flip-down jump
   seats behind the front seats as well, adding two more places to sit:
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A

   Advertisement

   If there are seat belts provided for the side-mounted seats, you could
   have five on the rear bench, plus the two jump seats, plus the front
   seats, for a total of nine seats, which seems about right.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   Advertisement

   There are some cubbies under the rear seats and in the doors, but it
   looks like there are no strictly-designated cargo areas, though there
   is certainly room for plenty of cargo on the large, flat floor area.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   Advertisement

   It also appears that the rear bench can fold to make room for bulky
   cargo, like that dude’s asphalt-colored surfboard, and it looks like
   there are two little modules in the side panel there, one containing a
   clock and the other having what I think is a small planter?
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   Advertisement

   It also appears that the front seats can rotate, Captian’s Chair-style,
   which is always a good thing for a van. There’s also plenty of windows
   in the roof as well, and the whole interior feels incredibly airy and
   open. It looks like it has lots of camping potential as well, and while
   I haven’t actually touched any of the interior materials, these
   pictures do make it look like they could be fairly hard-wearing and
   hopefully easily washable.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   The Canoo uses conventional hinged doors instead of a more van-like
   sliding door, which is sort of a curious choice, but not necessarily a
   bad one. The only really glaring bad choice I can see here is in the
   driver’s controls, with a steering wheel that’s not a wheel at all, but
   a square frame:
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A

   Visibility looks great, sure, with that extra low window below the
   beltline, but does anyone actually like driving with a rectangle?
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   Advertisement

   The center of the not-wheel has an airbag with a lot of text I’m pretty
   sure you don’t need to have so constant and prominent, while the
   instrumentation appears to be on the beltline band separating the upper
   and lower windshields.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   Advertisement

   There’s a large volume of space in front of the instrument panel that I
   suppose could be used for cargo, at the risk of blocking that lower
   window.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   The fundamental design of the Canoo I think is great. It’s logical and
   practical yet feels sleek and futuristic as well. This is what Tesla’s
   Model X should have been, really, instead of a chubby SUV with fancy
   doors. This has the potential to be a genuine do-anything electric
   transport pod, and I mean that in a good way.

   Technically, the 4,453-pound Canoo has a single rear-mounted motor
   making a claimed 300 horsepower, and with their floor-mounted 80 kWh
   battery pack, they claim a range of 250 miles, all decent numbers.

   Advertisement

   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A
   Packaging Triumph

   Canoo has some diagrams that suggest alternate bodies for their
   platform may be possible down the road, for sportier models, possibly
   with HVAC fans capable of blowing ties backward.

   Advertisement

   Now, Canoo’s model isn’t an ownership one, so if you want to buy one,
   you can’t. It’s a subscription model, much like what Lynk & Co is
   planning, where everything—insurance, registration, maintenance, even
   charging costs—is wrapped up in a monthly fee. It’s not clear if there
   will be minimums or not yet, but if there aren’t this could potentially
   even compete with rental cars.

   The design looks impressive, but the real question is, of course, will
   it actually happen? Canoo was born as EVelozcity (and thankfully
   they’ve changed that idiotic name) and began with a lot of people who
   came from perpetual shitshow Faraday Future, amid a lot of fighting and
   legal battles.

   Advertisement

   Things seem to have settled down, and Canoo allegedly has decent
   funding, but this is a hard business to get going in, so I’m not sure a
   breath-holding policy makes sense here. Like all startups, we can only
   dream.

   Still, it’s a clever vehicle, and could be interesting competition to
   Volkswagen’s upcoming ID Buzz. A lot will depend on how much those
   monthly subscriptions are, and how well they can be supported.

   I guess we’ll just have to see.

The Very Best Hats Of The Goodwood Revival

   Another year, another Goodwood Revival, the car event that transports
   attendees back in time to a period where swing dresses and pillbox hats
   were the norm. I was fortunate enough to be able to make it back this
   year, and while the cars were interesting, I really spent much of my
   time admiring all the hats.

   (Full disclosure: Subaru invited me to attend the 2019 Goodwood Revival
   on its dime. It paid for my flights, put me up in two very nice hotels,
   fed me, provided all the booze I could want and helicoptered me to and
   from all three days of the Revival.)

   Hats are one of the very best accessories you could have. A hat can
   either make or break an outfit. And hats these days just don’t do it
   for me. A baseball cap is functional, but it’s not very fashionable.
   And I could never get into those wide-brim hats women have been wearing
   recently.

   The ridiculous, Derby-style hats of the Revival, though? Those are
   extremely my style. The bigger and more outrageous they are, the
   happier I am. I went around looking for the best colors and textures I
   could. Here’s what I found.

   The lady in the top shot is wearing a fabulous hat with the flowers
   woven into the brim’s design. It looks like it’s perpetually at a
   jaunty angle.

The Story Behind The Bright Orange Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn

   Among a sea of rubber-necking passersby, a woman from Bulgaria stops
   dead in her tracks, and some Polish men in a van slow to crawl.
   Eventually a dark-colored Porsche Cayenne rolls up and its windows
   rolls down slowly, revealing a young man originally from Moscow with
   many questions. All approach the car as one would an estranged,
   childhood friend.

   This morning Kyle told us about an attack walrus—which is like a SEAL
   but bigger—which fought and successfully took down a Russian boat. The
   walrus, who may have taken down dozens more inflatable boats in the
   past, was never captured. Some have an idea who the suspect might be,
   but there is not enough proof to convict.

   Another year, another Goodwood Revival, the car event that transports

   were the norm. I was fortunate enough to be able to make it back this

   Toyota says the 2020 Supra feels different to drive than its mechanical
   twin, the 2020 BMW Z4 M40i. Actually, since the start, both carmakers
   have been hammering about how distinguished each car is, telling us
   they went off their own separate ways once the shared architecture was
   laid out.

   [jalopnik-saturated.png] Jalopnik ReviewsAll of our test drives in one
   convenient place.

   Toyota says the 2020 Supra feels different to drive than its mechanical
   twin, the 2020 BMW Z4 M40i. Actually, since the start, both carmakers
   have been hammering about how distinguished each car is, telling us
   they went off their own separate ways once the shared architecture was
   laid out.

   I’ve been tracking this BMW-Toyota love affair for quite a while now.
   It began with me driving the new Z4 in its four-cylinder trim last
   winter down in Palm Springs, a car BMW calls the Z4 SDrive30i. I liked
   it quite a lot.

   Then, I drove the G20 3 Series sedan, and finally, this, the Supra and
   Z4. They all feel very similar, to be honest. But since the very
   beginning, everyone has wondered which company wore this engine and
   platform best.

   Having these two globalized car-siblings in my driveway confirmed an
   important question: is the Supra still a Supra even if it’s not... a
   Toyota? Or, perhaps, more importantly, are these twins really all that
   different?

   (Full disclosure: The opportunity to drive both the 2020 BMW Z4 M40i
   and the 2020 Toyota GR Supra came up when work colleague Vincent Aubé
   and I joined forces to do a comparo. BMW and Toyota Canada agreed,
   and prepared us clean cars with a full tank of gas.)

What Are They?

   2020 Toyota Supra

   The return of the Supra has arguably been one of most talked about
   automotive topics this year, at least among enthusiasts. After all, the
   last-generation Supra, also known as the MKIV, garnered itself a
   legendary reputation in the tuner car world even before starring in The
   Fast and the Furious and an exorbitant amount of street racing videos.
   The Supra is the poster child of 1990s Japanese performance.

The 2020 Toyota Supra Is Not What We Expected but It Is Very Good

   There was a time in my life, starting in the late 1990s and lasting
   several years after that, where …

   For Toyota to announce the return of its halo sports car 20 years after
   it died is a big deal, especially when also announcing there will be no
   manual gearbox and that the car’s heart won’t even be Japanese.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   To be fair, a partnership like this BMW-Toyota one actually makes a lot
   of sense from a business standpoint, especially in our current era,
   where sports car sales are in the toilet and electrified crossovers
   will soon rule the roads.

   I’m told the initial idea for the joint-venture came from Toyota, which
   put the most amount of money on the table for it to happen and wanted
   the Supra to have a straight-six like it used to. Meanwhile, BMW got a
   new roadster in the deal, and one they hoped would be more competitive
   with the Porsche Boxster and Cayman than ever before.

The 2019 BMW Z4 Isnʼt a Hardcore Sports Car, but Hereʼs Why Thatʼs Okay

   A hairdresser’s car? A worthy alternative to the Porsche Boxster? The
   savior of BMW’s sports cars…

   Production of both cars would be subcontracted by the Magna Steyr
   automobile manufacturer in Graz, Austria, alongside the BMW 5 Series
   and other German vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.

   2020 Toyota Supra

   Both cars share BMW’s new modular, CLAR platform, as well as a
   BMW-sourced turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline-six mated to a ZF
   eight-speed automatic gearbox. In both cases, power is sent to the rear
   wheels only.

   From a mechanical standpoint, the Supra and the Z4, or what some have
   taken to calling the Zupra, are indeed quite identical. Tire, wheel and
   brake sizes, all the same. Pop the hood, and even the finest details
   are carbon copies of one another.

   The differences lie in tuning, engineers say—of the suspension, engine,
   exhaust note and more. Toyota’s folks will tell you they got the
   hardware and figured things out from there. It’s entirely possible they
   feel different to drive; the question is how much?
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The end result is still rather interesting, spawning two completely
   different types of very capable sports cars, aimed at entirely unique
   demographics. One is a luxury two-seat roadster, the other is a sports
   coupe. The Z4 can be powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder,
   something the Supra currently only offers in other markets. The Z4 has
   more options, while the Supra comes in one all-inclusive package.

   Also, between the two press units that lied in my driveway, there was a
   $16,000 CAN ($12,000 US) price gap.

   BMW claims its more-expensive Z4 M40i, the most powerful and potent
   variant, pumps out 381 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque while
   weighing in at 3,622 pounds.

   The Supra, on the other hand, puts down a promised 335 horsepower and
   365 torques at 3,397 pounds. However, some dyno tests have revealed
   even higher numbers, suggesting the Toyota actually generates north of
   400 lb-ft of torque. BMW’s infamous for underrating engines, so I do
   suspect both are really more powerful than initial numbers would have
   you believe.

Why Do They Matter?

   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Many would like to know which of these two carmakers calibrated this
   platform the best. Perhaps, more obvious than that, is the
   fifth-generation Toyota Supra any good?

   One thing’s for certain: Toyota needed a Supra in its portfolio. While
   the brand has been working hard lately at shedding its boring-beige
   reputation with fun cars like the 86, the manual-gearbox Corolla
   hatchback, Lexus models with some edge, and quite a few solid offerings
   for off-road enthusiasts, it still hasn’t had a top-shelf sports car
   since the last Supra left us in 1997.

   Also, with the Nissan GT-R’s refusal to die and the return of the Acura
   NSX, plus Mazda plugging away with the always-great MX-5 Miata, Toyota
   kind of had to hop back into the mix.

   BMW, on the other hand, didn’t really need a new Z4, per se. It’s been
   doing fine selling M cars and high-performance variants of pretty much
   everything it sells, including its ever-expanding lineup of SUVs.

   Also, with the Mercedes-Benz SLC now gone as well as an unknown future
   for the Audi TT, or the we-might-as-well-pronounce-it-dead Alfa Romeo
   4C, the small premium roadster segment isn’t exactly flourishing at the
   moment. A fresh new Z4, however, allows BMW to be alone in that niche
   with the Boxster. And if there’s anything we know about BMW these days,
   its motto may be Leave No Niche Behind.

   Because it’s the car that generates the most amount of excitement, both
   online and on the street, I’m going to begin with the Supra.

   Its styling is a much more in-your-face effort than the Z4’s, with its
   curves, bulging arches and duckbill spoiler hanging out the back. This
   is a car that wants your attention and does a rather good job grabbing
   it.

   My tester was painted in the Absolute Zero white paint job, which
   looked quite dashing with the contrasting red-on-black interior. As a
   matter of fact, everywhere we drove it, people went nuts over this
   thing.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Inside, it’s mostly a copy and paste of BMW’s latest dashboard layouts.
   The Supra does, however, incorporate its own little design cues like
   air vents and gauge readouts. Also, SUPRA! logos here and there remind
   you what you’re driving.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   But let’s not get too carried away here. The entire center console,
   HVAC controls, and shifter are taken straight out of the Z4. So is the
   iDrive infotainment interface which Toyota adorably tried to change
   with different colors and images of tiny Supras.

   Otherwise, it’s the exact same system as in all current-generation BMW
   cars and SUVs. It still can’t connect to Android Auto, but other than
   that iDrive is good. Probably one of the best right now.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Supra’s cabin is visibly more confined than the Z4’s, with an
   aggressive roofline that’s not exactly kind to big guys like me. I kept
   having to lower my head to look outside the car, and banged it a few
   times getting in. I did enjoy the seats, though. Supportive during hard
   driving and comfortable for long trips.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   I had a peculiar problem driving the Supra with its windows lowered.
   Turbulence was intense at freeway speeds, so bad, in fact, that I ended
   up running the car with the AC on most of the time.

   My hypothesis is that the problem comes from the enormous pass-through
   located behind the seats. It’s a handy feature to throw your junk in
   the trunk from the driver’s seat. But it seems to create some kind of a
   venturi effect when the windows are dropped.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   On the road, the Supra feels immediately more urgent and playful than
   the Z4. It’s audibly louder and more alive as well, spooling its turbo
   and emitting healthy belches out its twin exhaust. Power kicks in
   quick, with very little appreciable lag, especially for a turbocharged
   engine.

   In case you’re still not aware, the GR badge refers to Gazoo Racing,
   Toyota’s latest motorsports arm. The outfit basically tuned, calibrated
   and tested the entire car.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   There’s only one extra drive mode in the Supra, and it’s Sport, which
   firms up the adaptive dampers, shifts more aggressively and adds some
   resistance to the steering wheel.

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   In Sport, all the character traits listed above become even more
   apparent, requiring you to be quite awake behind the wheel. It’s a wild
   car, feeling indeed much more powerful than its 335-HP engine suggests.
   It’s also a stunningly loud machine when Sport Mode is engaged.

   So I’m calling it here and now: the Supra is undoubtedly the more fun
   car to drive.

   And yet I don’t know if it’s because I’m getting old, or because I
   wanted to work on my tan, but I much preferred the Z4 over the Supra.

BMW Z4 M40i

   2020 Toyota Supra

   The thing is, even though it’s considerably more expensive, the Z4
   feels like a more complete car. It’s almost as if BMW kept all the good
   stuff for itself.

   For instance, its interior is noticeably more spacious and comfortable
   than in the Toyota. One, because, yes, you can drive it with the top
   down; an added bonus during a warm Autumn day.

   But also because once its quick-retracting soft top is put back into
   place, there’s still massive headroom in the cabin.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The seats are also plushier, with leg extenders you don’t get in the
   other car. Interior design is all BMW, with BMW’s own switchgear, so
   the entire cabin feels more genuine and upscale, with finer-feeling
   materials. I also didn’t have to deal with that stupid wind problem
   during open-air driving.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Z4 doesn’t have the Supra’s handy pass-through between its seats,
   there’s only a tiny opening the size of an iPad to access the trunk,
   but total cargo space remains high, almost identical to its hatchback
   sister, actually.

   The Z4 gives way to 9.9 cubic feet versus 10.1 cubes in the Supra.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Z4 not only looks more mature than its Japanese-tuned brother, but
   it also drives in a much more grown-up manner. Not that the car isn’t
   attractive, because it is. I’m personally a fan of its slim LED
   taillights, they remind me of the BMW Z8 roadster from the early 2000s.

   It does end up feeling more anonymous as a result. Next to the Supra,
   the Z4 simply disappears, appearing like some other snob, expensive
   convertible, and at times seeming to share proportions with a
   Mercedes-Benz SL.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   From behind the wheel, things are much more toned down, civilized, yet
   equally athletic. The Z4 doesn’t wag its tail under hard acceleration
   like the Supra, but rather squats down and burns a bit of rubber as it
   charges forward with a good, strong rush of power.

   It generally feels like a larger, heavier automobile, with a
   significantly less wild exhaust note and a more controlled ride.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   What the Z4 lacks in flamboyance, it makes up for with greater drive
   mode flexibility, allowing it to be a more enjoyable daily driver. For
   instance, while the Supra only has one alternate mode, the Z4 has a
   total of five, ranging from Sport, Sport +, Comfort, EcoPro and
   Adaptive, which automatically adapts to your driving style.

   All modes actually change the car’s character to surprisingly great
   lengths.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   Another feature I preferred in the BMW, was the ability to shove the
   gearbox in automatic S mode, where it still does the shifting for you,
   but in a more aggressive manner than D.

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   The Supra doesn’t offer this, it simply goes from D to manual mode.
   Yes, its Sport mode takes care of that for you, but you can’t opt for a
   quick transmission and a soft, comfortable ride, for instance.

   Fun fact: after driving this Z4, I spent some time behind the wheel of
   a 2020 BMW M4 convertible. It felt like a slow, heavy dinosaur next to
   this. That’s how fresh and modern that new CLAR platform feels, and how
   quick the Z4 M40i is.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   For the sake of this comparo, we had arranged some track time over at
   Sanair where we could properly assess acceleration times, braking, and
   overall lap performance for each car.

   While Toyota eagerly accepted to let us bring the Supra at the track,
   BMW backed away at the last minute due to insurance-related issues. So
   we couldn’t get real numbers down. However, judging from our seat of
   the pants experience, Vincent and I both agreed that the Supra felt
   like the faster car.

Verdict

   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   There’s no denying that both the 2020 Toyota GR Supra and the 2020 BMW
   Z4 M40i are the same car. But they are good cars. Their origins don’t
   in any way detract from the driving experiences they offer.

   If anything, these two are up there among the most potent performance
   machines available for under $100,000 (please don’t make Corvette C8
   jokes).

   And the great thing is, they do feel different!
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Supra is definitely aimed at a younger, more driving-oriented
   buyer, and it does a fantastic job fulfilling that mission. If you
   haven’t driven recent BMW products, walk inside a Toyota dealer and ask
   to test drive a Supra, you’re not going to be disappointed. It’s one
   hell of a sports car, and you’ll be getting a lot of performance for
   your dollar.

   But if you know your cars, if not just a tad, you know the differences
   between driving a Toyota and driving a BMW. This Supra doesn’t drive,
   sound, or even smell like a Toyota.

   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   So in that sense, no, the 2020 Toyota Supra doesn’t compare to its
   predecessor because it’s not a true Japanese effort. It’s too different
   in too many ways. The fourth-generation car had been developed to, yes,
   satisfy enthusiasts, but also to showcase Toyota’s engineering know-how
   against the world, most notably the German carmakers.

   Now, it’s the Germans that build the damn thing.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   The Z4, on the other hand, arrived in the ring quiet and humble,
   overshadowed by the hype the Supra had created. It ended up being the
   car I enjoyed driving the most, either because it offers more as a car,
   but also because it feels like a genuine BMW effort.

   If there’s a higher-level takeaway here, it might be that there should
   be an unwritten rule in the automotive industry: never outsource your
   halo car.

   Those are the automobiles that attract people into your showroom, the
   “hey, look what we can do” vehicle that convinces buyers to buy that
   RAV4 because it shares components with the sports car.
   Illustration for article titled Why I Actually Prefer The BMW Z4 To The
   2020 Toyota Supra

   That doesn’t really apply here. As much fun as the new Supra is, its
   greatness isn’t something Toyota can truly claim for itself.

This Startup's Electric Van Is A Packaging Triumph

   Packaging Triumph

   One of the biggest advantages of electric vehicles is that they can
   potentially have far more packaging flexibility than combustion-engine
   cars. Companies have been taking advantage of this, as you can see in
   Tesla’s twin-trunk designs and Volkswagen’s volume-maximizing reborn
   electric Microbus. A startup called Canoo is taking a similar approach
   as VW, with an EV that’s a clever study in the maximization of interior
   volume. You know, a van.

   Though it’s not autonomous, though the company says they’re working on
   that, the room-on-wheels design is exactly what future autonomous
   vehicles should be (there may be a book out that says just that) and
   even in its current, human-driven form, the design looks incredibly
   flexible and usable.

   Packaging Triumph

   The Canoo was designed by Richard Kim, the designer behind BMW’s very
   innovative i3 and the sleek i8, and while there are clear similarities
   to Kim’s earlier designs, the Canoo shows a much purer design, an
   unashamed, streamlined, heavily-windowed box on a skateboard, an
   envelope that surrounds a very versatile and appealing interior.

   The front and rear profiles of the Canoo are just about identical; were
   it not for the position of the rear-view mirrors and colors of the
   lights, it would be hard to tell which end was front and which was the
   rear. It’s sort of like a very modernized VW Bus, or perhaps even an
   enlarged and updated Zündapp Janus.

   The rear of the vehicle has a U-shaped bench seat, with what appears to
   be seat belts for three passengers. There’s also some flip-down jump
   seats behind the front seats as well, adding two more places to sit:
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A

   If there are seat belts provided for the side-mounted seats, you could
   have five on the rear bench, plus the two jump seats, plus the front
   seats, for a total of nine seats, which seems about right.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A

   There are some cubbies under the rear seats and in the doors, but it
   looks like there are no strictly-designated cargo areas, though there
   is certainly room for plenty of cargo on the large, flat floor area.
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A

   It also appears that the rear bench can fold to make room for bulky
   cargo, like that dude’s asphalt-colored surfboard, and it looks like
   there are two little modules in the side panel there, one containing a
   clock and the other having what I think is a small planter?
   Illustration for article titled This Startup&#39;s Electric Van Is A

   It also appears that the front seats can rotate, Captian’s Chair-style,
   which is always a good thing for a van. There’s also plenty of windows
   in the roof as well, and the whole interior feels incredibly airy and
   open. It looks like it has lots of camping potential as well, and while
   I haven’t actually touched any of the interior materials, these
   pictures do make it look like they could be fairly hard-wearing and
   hopefully easily washable.

   The Canoo uses conventional hinged doors instead of a more van-like
   sliding door, which is sort of a curious choice, but not necessarily a
   bad one. The only really glaring bad choice I can see here is in the
   driver’s controls, with a steering wheel that’s not a wheel at all, but
   a square frame:

   Visibility looks great, sure, with that extra low window below the
   beltline, but does anyone actually like driving with a rectangle?

   The center of the not-wheel has an airbag with a lot of text I’m pretty
   sure you don’t need to have so constant and prominent, while the
   instrumentation appears to be on the beltline band separating the upper
   and lower windshields.

   There’s a large volume of space in front of the instrument panel that I
   suppose could be used for cargo, at the risk of blocking that lower
   window.

   The fundamental design of the Canoo I think is great. It’s logical and
   practical yet feels sleek and futuristic as well. This is what Tesla’s
   Model X should have been, really, instead of a chubby SUV with fancy
   doors. This has the potential to be a genuine do-anything electric
   transport pod, and I mean that in a good way.

   Technically, the 4,453-pound Canoo has a single rear-mounted motor
   making a claimed 300 horsepower, and with their floor-mounted 80 kWh
   battery pack, they claim a range of 250 miles, all decent numbers.

   Canoo has some diagrams that suggest alternate bodies for their
   platform may be possible down the road, for sportier models, possibly
   with HVAC fans capable of blowing ties backward.

   Now, Canoo’s model isn’t an ownership one, so if you want to buy one,
   you can’t. It’s a subscription model, much like what Lynk & Co is
   planning, where everything—insurance, registration, maintenance, even
   charging costs—is wrapped up in a monthly fee. It’s not clear if there
   will be minimums or not yet, but if there aren’t this could potentially
   even compete with rental cars.

   The design looks impressive, but the real question is, of course, will
   it actually happen? Canoo was born as EVelozcity (and thankfully
   they’ve changed that idiotic name) and began with a lot of people who
   came from perpetual shitshow Faraday Future, amid a lot of fighting and
   legal battles.

   Advertisement

   Things seem to have settled down, and Canoo allegedly has decent
   funding, but this is a hard business to get going in, so I’m not sure a
   breath-holding policy makes sense here. Like all startups, we can only
   dream.

   Still, it’s a clever vehicle, and could be interesting competition to
   Volkswagen’s upcoming ID Buzz. A lot will depend on how much those
   monthly subscriptions are, and how well they can be supported.

   I guess we’ll just have to see.

   Another year, another Goodwood Revival, the car event that transports
   attendees back in time to a period where swing dresses and pillbox hats
   were the norm. I was fortunate enough to be able to make it back this
   year, and while the cars were interesting, I really spent much of my
   time admiring all the hats.

   (Full disclosure: Subaru invited me to attend the 2019 Goodwood Revival
   on its dime. It paid for my flights, put me up in two very nice hotels,
   fed me, provided all the booze I could want and helicoptered me to and
   from all three days of the Revival.)

   Hats are one of the very best accessories you could have. A hat can
   either make or break an outfit. And hats these days just don’t do it
   for me. A baseball cap is functional, but it’s not very fashionable.
   And I could never get into those wide-brim hats women have been wearing
   recently.

   The ridiculous, Derby-style hats of the Revival, though? Those are
   extremely my style. The bigger and more outrageous they are, the
   happier I am. I went around looking for the best colors and textures I
   could. Here’s what I found.

   The lady in the top shot is wearing a fabulous hat with the flowers
   woven into the brim’s design. It looks like it’s perpetually at a
   jaunty angle.

The Story Behind The Bright Orange Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn

   Among a sea of rubber-necking passersby, a woman from Bulgaria stops
   dead in her tracks, and some Polish men in a van slow to crawl.
   Eventually a dark-colored Porsche Cayenne rolls up and its windows
   rolls down slowly, revealing a young man originally from Moscow with
   many questions. All approach the car as one would an estranged,
   childhood friend.

   Two dudes (photographer Nick Wiesner and I) perched on the corner of
   Wythe and North 4th in Williamsburg, sipping iced coffees and tapping
   smartphones. It’s a bourgeoise scene, yet we’re brought together by a
   bright-orange 4x4 standard of the Soviet Union. It’s called the Lada
   “Niva” (Russian for “field with crops”).
   Illustration for article titled The Story Behind The Bright Orange

   At a glance, it’s an absurd combination of object and place—like a
   coconut tree growing out of a Norwegian Fjord. But, then again, it
   isn’t. Something feels right. I can’t shake the feeling that the Niva
   is supposed to be there, up against that sticker-bombed fire alarm
   call-box.

   Our street encounters shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since the late
   ‘80s, New York City has seen a surge of immigration from the former
   Eastern Bloc. In particular, immigrants from the former USSR
   (Ukrainians, Polish, Russians, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Belarusians, Kyrgyz and
   so on) form a sizable chunk of New York City’s population, especially
   in South Brooklyn. And though these groups are culturally and
   linguistically distinct from one another, being under a single Soviet
   banner for the better part of a century did have some universalizing
   effects: like the mayonnaise-laden ‘salads’ and, of course, the
   cars—Ladas in particular.
   Illustration for article titled The Story Behind The Bright Orange
   Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn
   Image: колеса.ру

   But even beyond the USSR’s borders, Ladas left their mark across the
   entirety of the Eastern Bloc—in states like Poland, Hungary, and
   Bulgaria. And for the New Yorkers who hail from this vast chunk of
   world (of which there are many), Ladas are a reminder of a
   not-so-distant socialist past.

   “People have stopped on a highway—almost held up traffic to the point
   of an accident—to stop, take photos; to tell me that they both loved
   and hated this car,” Nick tells me.

   “One or two people say that this is the exact [Niva] that their
   grandfather had.” Another guy was once “almost overwhelmed to tears” by
   the car.

   Moreover, it’s not just New Yorkers with Eastern Bloc roots that are
   responding. The Niva was actually sold all over the world. And I’m not
   just talking about the Soviet-allied states like Egypt or Cuba. Even
   the Canadians got them; though the U.S. never did, sadly.

   Soon enough, another awestruck New Yorker pauses in front of the Niva.
   He mentions that he’s from Haiti. Blissfully examining the car, he
   whispers something to himself about all the memories.

   Nick’s own relationship with the Lada Niva began where you wouldn’t
   necessarily expect—in his ancestral homeland of Medellín, Colombia.
   Nick didn’t set out to buy a Niva in particular. He needed a durable,
   off-roadable and, above all, cheap ride to get around Colombia’s
   mountainous terrain. A white Niva ended up being Nick’s solution. But
   only sort of.
   Illustration for article titled The Story Behind The Bright Orange
   Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn
   Photo: Nick Wiesner

   When Nick bought the Niva, his family laughed. Not with him, at him.
   Ladas have a reputation in Colombia for being, well, not particularly
   reliable. But this didn’t phase Nick. He was a man in need of a beater,
   and that’s when the best kind of mistakes are made.

   It only got funnier when Nick drove the Niva three hours into the
   mountains, where the timing chain decided to snap. On a blind corner of
   a narrow, winding road. With heavy traffic and big rig trucks barreling
   past in both directions. All while accompanied by an American who’d
   never been to South America before—who was having a panic attack.

   You’d think this episode would forever put an end to Nick’s
   relationship with Soviet cars. But that’s not how these things work.
   The more epic your nightmare, the stronger your bond. As such, Nick’s
   turbulent expedition through the mountains of Colombia was just another
   twist in a lasting love affair—one between a young man and an old car.
   And it’s a love that has since transcended continents. Because, when
   Nick relocated to Brooklyn a few years back, he bought another Niva:
   the bright-orange one you see here.
   Illustration for article titled The Story Behind The Bright Orange
   Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn
   Photo: Nick Wiesner

   Admittedly, it may seem like an irrational thing to do—owning a Niva,
   let alone any classic car, in New York City. But Nick may be onto
   something here.

   Though New York isn’t necessarily a “rugged, off-road terrain, it is in
   certain ways,” Nick admits. The Niva works as an “urban off-roader.” As
   such, no construction plate, knee-deep pothole, or unmarked speed hump
   presents a serious challenge to the Niva—a car designed to survive
   Siberia, let alone Park Slope.

   “It works for New York City,” Nick says of his Niva. “I’m at the same
   height as the Land Rovers and Range Rovers, but at a quarter of the
   other dimensions, so I can squeeze past.” This is key because driving
   in New York City often comes down to squeezing gaps. As it’s roughly as
   wide as a third-gen Smart Car, the Niva is in the top-tier of the
   gap-squeezing hierarchy.

   Nick says he’s given the “right of way” often, partly because “people
   understand that you might not be able to brake on a dime.” But it also
   might be because the Niva, despite its smallness and spartanness, is
   very noticeable.

   At one point a bro starts yelling at us from the back seat of an Uber.

   “What car is that?”

   “A Niva,” Nick says.

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   “What’s that?”

   “A Lada.”

   “And what’s that?”

   “A Russian car.”

   “. . . Oh.”
   Illustration for article titled The Story Behind The Bright Orange
   Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn
   Photo: Nick Wiesner

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Nick gets these questions—in that exact order—all the time. “People who
   don’t know what [the Niva] is still find it aesthetically interesting.”
   There’s something aesthetic about the car. “Right now, this look is
   coming back. People want FJs; people want Land Cruisers; people want
   this kind of old Range Rover/Land Rover Defender kind of vibe and [the
   Niva] has that kind of DNA in it.”

   In a perpetually gridlocked city with a 25 mph speed limit, it’s hard
   to imagine enjoying a car. But going over, say, the Manhattan Bridge,
   Nick can wind out the Niva to its full potential. “I can overtake” and
   speed up to “almost forty miles per hour.” Sure, in some old Porsche
   these speeds feel lame. But in a Soviet-built 4x4 with vending-machine
   aerodynamics, it feels exciting, if not a bit terrifying.

   I got to drive Nick’s car around Williamsburg and, I must say, a
   classic Niva feels surprisingly light—even lighter than the 2019 model
   I reviewed earlier this summer. The transmission is crisp and smooth in
   spite of its age. The clutch travel is light and short which, for city
   traffic, is fine. The steering will surprise you. Yes, it’s unassisted,
   but the wheel is enormous—fit for a city bus, if not a dump truck. And,
   the wider your steering wheel, the less work your forearms do.
   Illustration for article titled The Story Behind The Bright Orange
   Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn

   (I should note that this Niva is a borderline-pristine example. It’s an
   import from Russia, where it was garage-kept by an old man for most of
   its life. Everything works as it should and, since buying the car,
   Nick’s been able to solve most problems “with a simple set of tools.” )

   Parallel parking the Lada Niva is a joy. This thing is inches shorter
   than the smallest new Mini you can buy. Plus, when you’re squeezing
   into a tight spot, there’s no vague bulge of 5-mph-bumper affecting
   your judgment—just very matter-of-fact 90 degree angles.

   Most importantly, the Lada Niva is a classic car that doesn’t cause
   paranoia. After all, this isn’t some Pebble-Beach-money-pit British
   roadster with caviar leaking out of the glove compartment. This is
   important because, in New York City, few vehicles survive the
   environment unscathed. If anything, a Niva with some battle scars is
   more authentic.
   Illustration for article titled The Story Behind The Bright Orange
   Soviet 4x4 Rolling Through Brooklyn
   Photo: Nick Wiesner

   Now is all this to say that you—resident of the Five Boroughs—should
   purchase a Lada Niva to use as a daily around the City? Absolutely not.
   It goes without saying, there are many fundamental problems with the
   Niva. I’m not suggesting that New Yorkers purchase a vintage Niva over,
   say, a Toyota Corolla or a MetroCard.

   But if you’re going to go through the trouble of owning a classic car
   in New York City—to drive occasionally and for fun—the Niva is an
   option that makes sense. It’s inexpensive, easy to park, a pleasure
   over potholes, and tiny enough to squeeze through gridlock. If
   something hits you—which is, frankly, inevitable—it isn’t the end of
   the world. (The Niva is still produced in Russia and, if anything, I’m
   sure you can order new parts online.)

   Plus, everybody wants to be your friend, and half of South Brooklyn has
   a story for you.
