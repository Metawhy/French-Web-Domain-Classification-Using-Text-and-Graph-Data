   UN-GGIM Europe > About Us

About Us

   Established in July 2011 through a resolution by the United Nations
   Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the United Nations initiative on
   Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) draws on the
   national capacities and capabilities of Member States. It takes a
   leading role in setting the agenda for global geospatial information
   development and promotes the benefits of geospatial information for
   addressing national policy and key global challenges.

   In addition to a global committee of experts, UN-GIMM developed a
   regional structure. In Europe, a preparatory committee provided
   guidance on the process of establishing a regional committee. The
   report of the Preparatory Committee formed part of the business of the
   Fourth Session of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global
   Geospatial Information Management 6-8 August 2014 at the UN
   Headquarters in New York.

   An informal side meeting of representatives from European UN Member
   States was held in New York on 5th August. The record of the meeting is
   available here.

   The Europe Region of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global
   Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM: Europe) was formally
   established at its first at the first plenary meeting of UN-GGIM Europe
   held in Chisinau, Moldova on 1st October 2014. At this meeting the
   Rules and Articles were adopted together with a work plan for the
   Regional Committee. The Articles and Rules of the UN-GGIM: Europe were
   subsequently revised and approved by the European UN Member States at
   the Fourth Plenary Meeting.
