[xampp-logo.svg] XAMPP Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl

Welcome to XAMPP for Linux 7.3.9

   You have successfully installed XAMPP on this system! Now you can start
   using Apache, MariaDB, PHP and other components. You can find more info
   in the FAQs section or check the HOW-TO Guides for getting started with
   PHP applications.

   XAMPP is meant only for development purposes. It has certain
   configuration settings that make it easy to develop locally but that
   are insecure if you want to have your installation accessible to
   others. If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet, make
   sure you understand the implications and you checked the FAQs to learn
   how to protect your site. Alternatively you can use WAMP, MAMP or LAMP
   which are similar packages which are more suitable for production.

   Start the XAMPP Control Panel to check the server status.

Linux Frequently Asked Questions

   How do I install XAMPP?
          Choose your flavor for your linux OS, the 32-bit or 64-bit
          version.

          Change the permissions to the installer

          chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run

          Run the installer

          sudo ./xampp-linux-*-installer.run

          That's all. XAMPP is now installed below the /opt/lampp
          directory.

   Does XAMPP include MySQL or MariaDB?
          Since XAMPP 5.5.30 and 5.6.14, XAMPP ships MariaDB instead of
          MySQL. The commands and tools are the same for both.

   How do I start XAMPP?
          To start XAMPP simply call this command:

          sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

          You should now see something like this on your screen:

          Starting XAMPP 1.8.2...
          LAMPP: Starting Apache...
          LAMPP: Starting MySQL...
          LAMPP started.
          Ready. Apache and MySQL are running.

          If you get any error messages visit our community pages for
          help.

          Also, note that there is a graphical tool that you can use to
          manage your servers easily. You can start this tool with the
          following commands:

          cd /opt/lampp
          sudo ./manager-linux.run (or manager-linux-x64.run)

   How do I stop XAMPP?
          To stop XAMPP simply call this command:

          sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop

          You should now see something like this on your screen:

          Stopping XAMPP 1.8.2...
          LAMPP: Stopping Apache...
          LAMPP: Stopping MySQL...
          LAMPP stopped.
          If you get any error messages visit our community pages for
          help.

          Also, note that there is a graphical tool that you can use to
          start/stop your servers easily. You can start this tool with the
          following commands:

          cd /opt/lampp
          sudo ./manager-linux.run (or manager-linux-x64.run)

   How can I test that everything worked?
          Type in the following URL at your favourite web browser:

          http://localhost

          You should see the XAMPP start page, as shown below.

          [xampp-linux-start.jpg]

   Is XAMPP production ready?
          XAMPP is not meant for production use but only for development
          environments. XAMPP is configured to be open as possible to
          allow the developer anything he/she wants. For development
          environments, this is great but in a production environment, it
          could be fatal.

          Here a list of missing security in XAMPP:

         1. The MySQL administrator (root) has no password.
         2. The MySQL daemon is accessible via network.
         3. ProFTPD uses the password "lampp" for user "daemon".

          To fix most of the security weaknesses simply call the following
          command:

          sudo /opt/lampp/lampp security

          It starts a small security check and makes your XAMPP
          installation secure. For example this protects the XAMPP demo
          pages by a username ('lampp') and password combination.

   What is the meaning of the error messages I see when starting XAMPP?
          You may get several error messages while starting XAMPP:

          LAMPP-Apache is already running.
          An Apache daemon is already running.

          The LAMPP startup script did not start XAMPP-Apache because
          there is an Apache instance already running. To start XAMPP
          properly, first you have to stop this daemon.

          LAMPP-MySQL is already running.
          A MySQL daemon is already running.

          Mostly due to the same reasons as the above error, the LAMPP
          startup script found a MySQL daemon already running on your
          system. To start LAMPP properly, you have to stop this daemon
          first.

   Apache doesn't seem to start. What can I do?
          This error can exist for multiple reasons. Apache displays this
          error under several circumstances. To find the exact reason, you
          have to do some research:

          tail -2 /opt/lampp/logs/error_log

          If you get any error messages visit our community pages for
          help.

   What do I do if the error message is "Cannot restore segment prot after
          reloc: Permission denied?"
          Some Linux distributions have SELinux activated by default and
          this is preventing the successful start of XAMPP. You should
          disable it in order to start the XAMPP servers:

          sudo /usr/sbin/setenforce 0

          Now XAMPP should work fine again.

   After I rebooted my Linux box XAMPP stopped running! How can I fix
          this?
          Correct. That's normal Linux behaviour (which applies to any
          other Unix-like system). It's the admin's job to make sure a
          particular application is started at bootup.

          There is no real standard way to configure the boot process of a
          Linux system, but most of them should allow you to start XAMPP
          at boot time using the following steps.

          Debian, Ubuntu.

          sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/lampp /etc/init.d/lampp sudo update-rc.d
          lampp start 80 2 3 4 5 . stop 30 0 1 6 .

          RedHat, Fedora, CentOS. If your Linux distro uses "chkconfig"
          tool to install the services you can run the following commands:

          sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/lampp /etc/init.d/lampp
          sudo chkconfig --add lampp

          SUSE

          sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/lampp /etc/init.d/lampp sudo chkconfig
          lampp 2345

   How can I make my XAMPP installation more secure?
          By default, XAMPP has no passwords set and it is not recommended
          to run XAMPP with this configuration as it is accessible to
          others.

          Simply type the following command (as root) to start a simple
          security check:

          sudo /opt/lampp/lampp security

          Now you should see the following dialog on your screen:

          XAMPP: Quick security check... XAMPP: MySQL is accessable via
          network.

          XAMPP: Normaly that's not recommended. Do you want me to turn it
          off? [yes] yes XAMPP: Turned off. XAMPP: Stopping MySQL...
          XAMPP: Starting MySQL... XAMPP: The MySQL/phpMyAdmin user pma
          has no password set!!! XAMPP: Do you want to set a password?
          [yes] yes XAMPP: Password: ****** XAMPP: Password (again):
          ****** XAMPP: Setting new MySQL pma password. XAMPP: Setting
          phpMyAdmin's pma password to the new one. XAMPP: MySQL has no
          root passwort set!!! XAMPP: Do you want to set a password? [yes]
          yes XAMPP: Write the passworde somewhere down to make sure you
          won't forget it!!! XAMPP: Password: ****** XAMPP: Password
          (again): ****** XAMPP: Setting new MySQL root password. XAMPP:
          Setting phpMyAdmin's root password to the new one. XAMPP: The
          FTP password for user 'nobody' is still set to 'lampp'. XAMPP:
          Do you want to change the password? [yes] yes XAMPP: Password:
          ****** XAMPP: Password (again): ****** XAMPP: Reload ProFTPD...
          XAMPP: Done.

          (1) Setting a password will protect the XAMPP demo pages
          (http://localhost/xampp/) using this password. The user name is
          'lampp'!

          After running this command, your XAMPP installation should be
          more secure.

   How do I activate eAccelerator?
          To activate eAccelerator simply find the following lines in your
          /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini:

          ;extension="eaccelerator.so" ;eaccelerator.shm_size="16"

          ;eaccelerator.cache_dir="/opt/lampp/tmp/eaccelerator"
          ;eaccelerator.enable="1" ;eaccelerator.optimizer="1"
          ;eaccelerator.check_mtime="1" ;eaccelerator.debug="0"
          ;eaccelerator.filter="" ;eaccelerator.shm_max="0"
          ;eaccelerator.shm_ttl="0" ;eaccelerator.shm_prune_period="0"
          ;eaccelerator.shm_only="0" ;eaccelerator.compress="1"
          ;eaccelerator.compress_level="9"

          Remove the semicolon at the beginning of each line and restart
          XAMPP. eAccelerator is now active. For more information about
          eAccelerator, check the eAccelerator home page:
          http://eaccelerator.net.

   How do I activate the OCI8/Oracle extension for PHP?
          To activate the OCI8/Oracle extension for PHP please execute the
          following command:

          sudo /opt/lampp/lampp oci8

          The following dialog will start:

          Please enter the path to your Oracle or Instant Client
          installation: [/opt/lampp/lib/instantclient-11.2.0.3.0]

          installing symlinks... patching php.ini... OCI8 add-on
          activation likely successful. LAMPP: Stopping Apache with SSL...
          LAMPP: Starting Apache with SSL...

          The extension should now be active.

   XAMPP runs, but why are none of the images being displayed?
          That's a special problem with some Linux systems. Please open
          your /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf and look for these two lines:

          #EnableMMAP off #EnableSendfile off

          Remove the # in both lines and restart your Apache. Your images
          should be back.

   How do I enable access to phpMyAdmin from the outside?
          In the basic configuration of XAMPP, phpMyAdmin is accessible
          only from the same host that XAMPP is running on, at
          http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost.

          IMPORTANT: Enabling external access for phpMyAdmin in production
          environments is a significant security risk. You are strongly
          advised to only allow access from localhost. A remote attacker
          could take advantage of any existing vulnerability for executing
          code or for modifying your data.

          To enable remote access to phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:

          + Edit the etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf file in your XAMPP
            installation directory.
          + Within this file, find the lines below.
            Alias /phpmyadmin "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin/" <Directory
            "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin"> AllowOverride AuthConfig Require
            local
          + Then replace 'Require local' with 'Require all granted'.
            Alias /phpmyadmin "/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin/" <Directory
            "/opt/lampp/phpMyAdmin"> AllowOverride AuthConfig Require all
            granted
          + Restart the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.

   Where are the main XAMPP configuration files?
          The main XAMPP configuration files are located as follows:

          + Apache configuration file: /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf,
            /opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-xampp.conf
          + PHP configuration file: /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini
          + MySQL configuration file: /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf
          + ProFTPD configuration file: /opt/lampp/etc/proftpd.conf

   How do I send email with XAMPP?
          To send email with XAMPP, use the PEAR Mail and Net_SMTP
          packages, which allow you to send email using an external SMTP
          account (such as a Gmail account). Follow these steps:

          + Install the Mail and Net_SMTP PEAR modules: pear install
            Net_SMTP Mail Note that if these packages are already
            installed in your system you see the messages below when
            executing that command: Ignoring installed package
            pear/Net_SMTP Ignoring installed package pear/Mail Nothing to
            install
          + Create the following example script in your "htdocs" directory
            to send an email: <?php require_once "Mail.php"; $from =
            "your-gmail-username@gmail.com"; $to =
            'recipients@example.com'; $host = "ssl://smtp.gmail.com";
            $port = "465"; $username = 'your-gmail-username@gmail.com';
            $password = 'your-gmail-password'; $subject = "test"; $body =
            "test"; $headers = array ('From' => $from, 'To' =>
            $to,'Subject' => $subject); $smtp = Mail::factory('smtp',
            array ('host' => $host, 'port' => $port, 'auth' => true,
            'username' => $username, 'password' => $password)); $mail =
            $smtp->send($to, $headers, $body); if (PEAR::isError($mail)) {
            echo($mail->getMessage()); } else { echo("Message successfully
            sent!\n"); } ?>
            Remember to replace the dummy values shown with your actual
            Gmail address and account password. If you don't plan to use
            Gmail's SMTP server, replace the SMTP host details with
            appropriate values for your organization or ISP's SMTP server.
          + Execute the script by browsing to it using your Web browser.
            You should see a notification that the message was
            successfully sent, and the message should be delivered to the
            recipient email address.

   How do I backup/restore my XAMPP system?
          WARNING: The backup and restore functionality is still under
          development and may not work correctly.

          You can create the backup by calling:

          sudo /opt/lampp/lampp backup

          or

          sudo /opt/lampp/lampp backup secret

          Where "secret" is your MySQL root password. This command will
          create the following output:

          Backing up databases... Backing up configuration, log and htdocs
          files...

          Calculating checksums... Building final backup file... Backup
          finished. Take care of
          /opt/lampp/backup/xampp-backup-22-01-14.sh

          The file /opt/lampp/backup/xampp-backup-22-01-14.sh (in the
          example above) contains your backup. Store this file in a safe
          place.

          On the new machine you need the same version of XAMPP as on your
          original/source machine.

          sudo sh xampp-backup-22-01-14.sh

          You should see something like this:

          Checking integrity of files... Restoring configuration, log and
          htdocs files...

          Checking versions... Installed: XAMPP 1.4.2 Backup from: XAMPP
          1.4.2 Restoring MySQL databases... Restoring MySQL user
          databases... Backup complete. Have fun! You may need to restart
          XAMPP to complete the restore.

          That's all. Keep in mind that it's a beta feature.
