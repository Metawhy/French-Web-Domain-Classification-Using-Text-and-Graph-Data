   Nicolas Dobigeon

   Nicolas Dobigeon received the Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering
   from INP-ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France, and the M.Sc. degree in Signal
   Processing from the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse
   (Toulouse INP), both in June 2004. He received the Ph.D. degree and
   Habilitation à Diriger les Recherches in Signal Processing from
   Toulouse INP in 2007 and 2012, respectively. From 2007 to 2008, he was
   a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical
   Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

   Since 2008, Nicolas Dobigeon has been with Toulouse INP (INP-ENSEEIHT,
   University of Toulouse) where he is currently a Professor. He conducts
   his research within the Signal and Communications (SC) group of IRIT
   and is an associate member of the Apprentissage Optimisation Complexité
   (AOC) project-team of CIMI. He currently holds an AI Research Chair at
   the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (ANITI) and
   he is a Junior Member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF,
   2017-2022).

   His recent research activities have been focused on statistical signal
   and image processing, with a particular interest in Bayesian inverse
   problems and applications to remote sensing, biomedical imaging and
   microscopy.

   He is currently a member of the SPTM TC of the IEEE Signal Processing
   Society (since 2018), an Associate Editor for Signal Processing (since
   2016) and Digital Signal Processing (since 2018) and the Deputy Head of
   the Dept. of Signals and Images at IRIT (since 2017).

   He was a steering committee member of the French research group
   GDR-ISIS (2013-2018), a member of French National Council of
   Universities (CNU/Section 61, 2012-2016) and an elected member at the
   Research Council of Toulouse INP (2014-2016). He was the Head of the
   Major Program on "Signal and Image Processing" at INP-ENSEEIHT
   (2011-2019).
