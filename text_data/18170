Project Boxster Clubsport: Part 24 – The Electric Motor

   9/25/201910:41 estFiled to: First Time Porsche OwnerBy: Bradley
   BrownellComment

   We're entering new territory here! Porsche has just introduced the
   first of likely many electric cars in its Taycan, and it probably won't
   be long until we have a hybridized 911 in dealer showrooms. It's time
   we got with the program and see how this electric propulsion stuff
   works first hand. We've had "Project Boxster Clubsport" for a few
   years, …

America Runs On Porsche 911 GT3 Donuts

   9/25/201910:01 estFiled to: Porsche GT2/GT3By: Tommy ParryComment

   The Hoonigans might not be well known among our readers, but they are
   one of the biggest automotive YouTube channels around. Their audience
   is in the millions, and their videos are geared towards the tinkering
   type of gearheads who dream about high-quality AN fittings and elevate
   automotive customization to the level of fetish. This naturally …

How Would You Build Your Taycan?

   9/24/201910:54 estFiled to: Electric PorscheBy: Bradley BrownellComment

   Porsche's build-your-own configurator for the Taycan Turbo and Taycan
   Turbo S have been live for a few weeks now, so surely you've had time
   to build your own ideal Taycan, right? I've spent my own time dreaming
   of getting behind the wheel of one of these. I don't have the
   six-figures necessary to step aboard my own Taycan, but I can build
   hundreds …

Manthey Tuned Porsche 993 RSR Blitzes Around Nurburgring GP Circuit

   9/24/20199:52 estFiled to: Porsche 993, Porsche Race CarsBy: Tommy
   ParryComment

   One of just forty-five 993 RSRs in existence, this 3.8-liter monster is
   a rare sight. Despite the small numbers, those curvaceous haunches,
   massive tires, and snorkels in the rear make you wonder why this model
   is not as well known. Perhaps this example deserves some special
   attention, since it's Olaf Manthey's very first racing car. A little …

Porsche’s Coca Cola Classic Liveries Return to Petit Le Mans

   9/19/20197:23 estFiled to: USCCBy: Tommy ParryComment

   While not as iconic as the Gulf-liveried 917, the Coca-Cola cars from
   the 1980s tug at the heartstrings of the dedicated Porschephile. As a
   part of this year's final round of the IMSA Weathertech Sportscar
   Championship at Road America, Porsche's works 911 RSRs will wear that
   classic red and white livery made famous through IMSA GTP. Coca-Cola's

What It’s Like To Drive a 400k+ Mile 944 Turbo

   9/18/20197:04 estFiled to: Porsche 944By: Chris CushingComment

   This 944 Turbo should seem familiar to long-time Flatsixes readers.
   Though it recently came into Ethan Tuft's care, for the last year it
   has lived with Bradley Brownell. This white 1987 944 Turbo is nicknamed
   Corporal Kaos, which makes for one of the most amusing vanity plates
   I've ever seen, and has hilariously high miles. Though it currently …

Tesla Built A Modified Model S In An Attempt to Steal the Taycan’s Thunder at
the Nurburgring

   9/17/20199:48 estFiled to: Electric PorscheBy: Tommy Parry2 Comments

     Porsche recently proved that the Taycan Turbo S was more than capable
   of setting quick laps at the Nurburgring, and that got a lot of
   international media attention. That didn't sit well with ego maniac and
   cult of personality Elon Musk. As the head of California-based Tesla,
   he is constantly trying to use his social media soapbox to keep …

The Porsche 911 Is A Champion of Profitability

   9/17/20199:15 estFiled to: 992, NewsBy: Chris CushingComment

   Transitioning into building an expanding lineup of electric models is a
   costly venture. Though the Taycan recently launched, and the next
   generation Macan is destined for electrification, these models are not
   expected to turn a profit for some time. Fortunately for Porsche, the
   bank of 911 is printing money. Though the marque's top sports car makes
