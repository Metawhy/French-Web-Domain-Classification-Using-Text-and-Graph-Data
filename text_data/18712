About Me

   Hi! I am Alexandre Mouriec and I am 22 years old. I am currently
   studying Computer Science at the IUT of Lannion. Outside college, I am
   working for companies or working on side-projects.

   Curious and passionate about computer science, startups, VC,
   development, and more... I am always excited to discover a new field or
   topic.
   I love making things so I often work on side-projects. These projects
   help me learn new skills like programming skills and solve problems.

   I had the chance to work with amazing companies and talented people
   over the last few years. There, I worked autonomously, sometimes
   remotely on small to really big projects. I love working in fast-paced
   startups trying to solve big problems.
   Feel free to contact by email here or DM me on Twitter anytime. I am
   always happy to help!
