   Neighborhood
   Staré Město (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the medieval heart
   of Prague. It’s no surprise it is bustling with tourists every time of
   day. Križovnický square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful square in the city.
   Its unique historical atmosphere of gothic houses and churches,
   cobblestone streets and squares, and stone towers blend together with
   the modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance clubs,
   international brand shops, galleries and hotels bring life to the old
   city. With its charming and picturesque cobblestone streets, the
   nightlife and parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Můžete si dojít do skvělé restaurace. Tento hotel se hodí, když

   Neighborhood
   Staré Město (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the medieval heart
   of Prague. It’s no surprise it is bustling with tourists every time of
   day. Križovnický square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful square in the city.
   Its unique historical atmosphere of gothic houses and churches,
   cobblestone streets and squares, and stone towers blend together with
   the modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance clubs,
   international brand shops, galleries and hotels bring life to the old
   city. With its charming and picturesque cobblestone streets, the
   nightlife and parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Very nice hotel close to the Old Town square
   "This was a 3 night trip booked by our daughter as a treat. Smart hotel
   with a Rolls Royce dealership in the lobby.The staff were always
   helpful and friendly.We got an upgrade to a comfortable room on floor 6
   with views over the river. Buffet style breakfast was good, but not
   cheap at €20 each. We didn't get round to using the rooftop
   restaurant or spa area. Unfortunately, the complimentary umbrella got a
   lot of use.…"

   Wonderful
   "We celebrated our parents’ 75th birthday in Prague and stayed at Hotel
   Intercontinental Prague over 3 nights. We had 4 rooms: Executive Suite,
   Executive Room, Deluxe Room, and a Classic Room. This was quite a
   unique opportunity to experience during one stay, a number of different
   room categories over one stay. I have to begin by pointing out that IC
   Prague’s staff were phenomenal. Both Jiri and Marina went out of their
   way to make our stay memorable, and they were entirely successful in
   doing so, together with their colleagues. No request was too difficult
   for them and we simply couldn’t remove the welcoming smile from their
   faces. They should both give classes to other hotel professionals on
   how to make a hotel guest feel welcomed :) The rooms were lovely: The
   Executive Suite was very spacious with a separate living room which
   included a nice sitting area and a full-size dining room, which we were
   very happy to use. The Executive room was very large and pleasant. The
   Deluxe and Classic rooms were smaller but very functional and pleasant.
   All rooms were spotlessly clean with comfortable beds an beddings. It
   is true that the hotel isn’t very modern and will soon begin to
   gradually go through room renovation. It is also true that there are
   newer 5-star hotels in town. However, I don’t think any other hotel can
   beat the IC’s charm, not to mention the location, which is no less than
   perfect. If you are after very high-end furnishing and decor - perhaps
   the Four Seasons would be a better option. If you seek a place that
   offers charm and character, situated in the best location Prague can
   offer and staffed by some of the nicest people in the hotel industry,
   don’t think twice about the Intercontinental.…"

   What is the cost of breakfast for children? Our reservation includes 2
   adult breakfast but we have 2 kids traveling with us. Thank you!
   Answer from GPTravel73
   Apr 2019 |
   At the time we wasn't traveling with children, but there's normally an
   offer on, if you check with reception when you arrive at the hotel they
   will tell you. Also breakfast can be included depending on what room
   type you are staying in, for this hotel you need to be in a CLUB room,
   there breakfast is included plus you have access to the Club floor.
   Good luck and have a nice holiday.

   Amazing Indian Food & Experience

   Just perfect for everything! High quality Indian food in an authentic
   Indian fine dining decor and atmosphere. Great service too, thank you
   Rajkumar! Worth every penny, and it is not over priced! Highly

   Good indian lunch

   Excellent food, very tasty. Generous portion. It's a pity they don't
   have better beer... and the decoration is extremely kitsch, but well,
   it's often the case in Indian restaurants. A bit pricey for Indian food
   in Prague.

   Must have for Tourists

   The Bar has all you need if you search for a well fashioned, friendly
   and good tasted Lounge. For me the best one of this kind.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Great cocktail bar, nice atmosphere cuban style

   Good nice Cuban style resto and bar, however expensive food related to
   other restaurants in Praque. Also drinks are relatively high in price..
   not typical Tsjech. However live music in the evenings and nice cosy
   interior style inside. Go for the excellent cocktails..!

   The #1 bar and dancing place in Prague!

   it’s great fun. Great music, good atmosphere and excellent service.
   It’s the nummer one bar/dancing place in Prague

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighborhoods in town represents the
   medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the

   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.
