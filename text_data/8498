About

   Joumana Accad

   Born and raised in Beirut, Joumana Accad left Lebanon for Paris
   (France) to complete her secondary education. She then moved to the US
   in 1979, obtained a bachelor degree in business administration (Cal.
   State University Fullerton). She settled in Texas and raised her two
   children while working as a school teacher. Her son and daughter now
   successful adults, Joumana decided to devote her life to her passions:
   Cooking, food writing, food styling and photography. She founded a blog
   in 2009, TasteofBeirut.com in which she showcased the traditions and
   regional cuisines of her native Lebanon and its mosaic of peoples.
   Meanwhile, she catered, taught classes at a health food chain, and
   attended the Pastry Arts program at El Centro College (Dallas).

   TasteofBeirut.com garnered a loyal following and Joumana was a frequent
   guest on radio and television shows such as Martha Stewart, ABC radio,
   Daytime, FOX, LBC-Sat, Al-HURRA and others. Her blog was nominated in
   2012 by Saveur magazine as Best in Regional Cuisine category. She wrote
   pieces in print and online media on Lebanese food traditions and her
   recipes were picked-up by the Readers Digest (Canada), The Daily Star
   (Lebanon), SheKnows.com (US), The Carton (UAE), Delicious (Holland),
   Sale e Pepe (Italy), shape.com, Chowhound (a CBS affiliate),
   shahiya.com and numerous others. As the founder of TasteofBeirut.com
   she worked with brands such as Sabra Dipping Co. (a subsidiary of
   PepsiCo.), Wild Garden (Ziyad Bros), Rotana Intl., Tanmia (Lebanon),
   Puck, Daiphat Foods (Taiwan) as a food stylist, photographer and
   consultant.

   Joumana relocated to Beirut, Lebanon in 2011 in order to immerse
   herself in the traditional cuisine she remembered from her
   grandmother’s and work with local master cooks to complete research on
   her cookbook, published in 2014 by Health Communications, Inc. (US).
   Her cookbook, Taste of Beirut, has enjoyed to date the largest number
   of independent five-star reviews from their roster of cookbooks and is
   available online through Amazon and other sites as well as in major
   bookstores in Lebanon.

   Joumana is currently dividing her time between Lebanon and Dallas
   (Texas). She plans to pursue food writing and blogging as well as
   collaboration with brands on recipe development, food styling and
   photography both in the US and the Middle East. She is fluent in
   English, French and Arabic and hopes to improve her proficiency in
   Spanish soon.

Sawa for Development and Aid

   I was invited to visit an NGO, SAWA for Development and Aid Operating
   in Lebanon, BarElias (Bekaa valley) by the refugee camps, it had been
   active since the very beginning of the Syrian war. I agreed right away,
   excited to get an insider’s look at their operation, but I was
   apprehensive. I figured I’d be rubbing elbows with folks who...

Adon&Myrrh

   It was on a bright June day that I set out to visit what I thought
   would be your typical olive press, i.e. a frantic, grubby place with
   noise and slime galore. The only hint that it may not have been the
   case was the intriguing and sophisticated name, Adon&Myrrh. Turned out
   quite the opposite of what I had expected;...

Pomegranates & Saffron by Feride Buyuran

   hands on it. I’ve had the cookbook in my possession for several months

Goodies

   If you are ever in need of food, and good food, in Beirut, your search

   high-traffic Verdun road with a parking lot on its side manned by
   several attendants, Goodies makes shopping there a no-brainer. As...

Fava bean and dill pilaf

   One of my very favorite pilafs! Its ideal in the Spring too, because
   the fava beans are in season, and the wild dill can be found everywhere
   in the mountains and fields nearby. I am truly sorry if these mountains
   are not a practical option, and if you do not grow fav beans in your
   kitchen garden, you would then...
