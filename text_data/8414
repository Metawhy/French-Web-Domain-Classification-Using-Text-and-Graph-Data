            PRISM-games
            PRISM-games is an extension of PRISM for probabilistic model
            checking of stochastic multi-player games.
            See the website and read the papers for more information.
            PRISM is a probabilistic model checker, a tool for formal
            modelling and analysis of systems that exhibit random or
            probabilistic behaviour. It has been used to analyse systems
            from many different application domains, including
            communication and multimedia protocols, randomised distributed
            algorithms, security protocols, biological systems and many
            others.
            Example PRISM graph PRISM can build and analyse several types
            of probabilistic models:
               o discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs)
               o continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs)
               o Markov decision processes (MDPs)
               o probabilistic automata (PAs)
               o probabilistic timed automata (PTAs)
            plus extensions of these models with costs and rewards.
            Models are described using the PRISM language, a simple,
            state-based language. PRISM provides support for automated
            analysis of a wide range of quantitative properties of these
            models, e.g. "what is the probability of a failure causing the
            system to shut down within 4 hours?", "what is the worst-case
            probability of the protocol terminating in error, over all
            possible initial configurations?", "what is the expected size
            of the message queue after 30 minutes?", or "what is the
            worst-case expected time taken for the algorithm to
            terminate?". The property specification language incorporates
            the temporal logics PCTL, CSL, LTL and PCTL*, as well as
            extensions for quantitative specifications and costs/rewards.
            PRISM incorporates state-of-the art symbolic data structures
            and algorithms, based on BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams) and
            MTBDDs (Multi-Terminal Binary Decision Diagrams) [KNP04b,
            Par02]. It also includes a discrete-event simulation engine,
            providing support for approximate/statistical model checking,
            and implementations of various different analysis techniques,
            such as quantitative abstraction refinement and symmetry
            reduction.

            Public License (GPL).

            PRISM-games
            PRISM-games is an extension of PRISM for probabilistic model
            checking of stochastic multi-player games.
            See the website and read the papers for more information.
            PRISM is a probabilistic model checker, a tool for formal
            modelling and analysis of systems that exhibit random or
            probabilistic behaviour. It has been used to analyse systems
            from many different application domains, including
            communication and multimedia protocols, randomised distributed
            algorithms, security protocols, biological systems and many
            others.
            Example PRISM graph PRISM can build and analyse several types
            of probabilistic models:
               o discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs)
               o continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs)
               o Markov decision processes (MDPs)
               o probabilistic automata (PAs)
               o probabilistic timed automata (PTAs)
            plus extensions of these models with costs and rewards.
            Models are described using the PRISM language, a simple,
            state-based language. PRISM provides support for automated
            analysis of a wide range of quantitative properties of these
            models, e.g. "what is the probability of a failure causing the
            system to shut down within 4 hours?", "what is the worst-case
            probability of the protocol terminating in error, over all
            possible initial configurations?", "what is the expected size
            of the message queue after 30 minutes?", or "what is the
            worst-case expected time taken for the algorithm to
            terminate?". The property specification language incorporates
            the temporal logics PCTL, CSL, LTL and PCTL*, as well as
            extensions for quantitative specifications and costs/rewards.
            PRISM incorporates state-of-the art symbolic data structures
            and algorithms, based on BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams) and
            MTBDDs (Multi-Terminal Binary Decision Diagrams) [KNP04b,
            Par02]. It also includes a discrete-event simulation engine,
            providing support for approximate/statistical model checking,
            and implementations of various different analysis techniques,
            such as quantitative abstraction refinement and symmetry
            reduction.
            PRISM is free and open source, released under the GNU General
            Public License (GPL).
