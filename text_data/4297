   UPDATED at 8:55p.m. PT with Sony response: Sony Pictures spent much of
   yesterday putting its perspective on the prospective loss of Kevin
   Feige from future Spider-Man films. First the studio downplayed the
   idea he might be leaving; then insiders pinned his exit on added
   responsibilities from the Fox acquisition of the X-Men franchise,
   though they declined to make a statement. All this was reflected as
   factors in Deadline’s break of an important and widely regurgitated
   story. But sources maintain that Feige’s exit was about money; it was
   about Disney seeking the 50/50 co-fi stake (sources said the original
   Disney ask was more reasonable) as the price for Marvel and Feige’s
   continued guiding hand that resulted in the delivery of Sony’s biggest
   grossing film ever. Sony declined to meet those terms or even counter
   with anything worth considering. It was an aggressive stance by Disney,
   which already owns the merchandise on Spider-Man, and a tough nut for
   Sony to swallow, giving up half of its most valuable franchise. But
   these talks had been going on for some time. Had Sony agreed to
   Disney’s ask, Marvel and Feige would not have withdrawn from the
   Spider-Man films, sources said.

   Sony issued a statement late in the evening, not denying anything
   Deadline revealed yesterday, but reiterating its stance that Feige was
   too busy. Deadline stands squarely behind its reporting. How important
   is Feige to the future of this franchise? We’ll find out down the line.
   Sony is planning two more installments, though it is an open question
   whether those will include Jon Watts, director of the first two films
   guided creatively by Feige. Watts isn’t signed on for the next film and
   isn’t a certainty to be back as he is being heavily courted for other
   jobs. Could Sony find itself vying against Marvel for Watts’ future
   services as director? Here is Sony’s late evening statement:  “Much of
   today’s news about Spider-Man has mischaracterized recent discussions
   about Kevin Feige’s involvement in the franchise. We are disappointed,
   but respect Disney’s decision not to have him continue as a lead
   producer of our next live action Spider-Man film,” a Sony spokesperson
   said. “We hope this might change in the future, but understand that the
   many new responsibilities that Disney has given him – including all
   their newly added Marvel properties – do not allow time for him to work
   on IP they do not own. Kevin is terrific and we are grateful for his
   help and guidance and appreciate the path he has helped put us on,
   which we will continue.”

   PREVIOUS DEADLINE EXCLUSIVE: Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige won’t
   produce any further Spider-Man films because of an inability by Disney
   and Sony Pictures to reach new terms that would have given the former a
   co-financing stake going forward. A dispute that has taken place over
   the past few months at the top of Disney and Sony has essentially nixed
   Feige, and the future involvement of Marvel from the Spider-Man
   universe, sources said.

   This comes at a moment when the last two films Kevin Feige produced
   broke all-time records — Disney’s Avengers: Endgame became the highest
   grossing film of all time, and Spider-Man: Far From Home this week
   surpassed the James Bond film Skyfall to become the all time highest
   grossing film for Sony Pictures.
   Spider-Man: Far From Home Spider-Man: Far From Home Columbia Pictures

   Sources said there are two more Spider-Man films in the works and the
   studio hopes to have director Jon Watts and Tom Holland front and
   center, though Watts doesn’t have a deal for the next picture and isn’t
   a lock to return. That isn’t helped by that fact that, unless something
   dramatic happens, Feige won’t be the lead creative producer of those
   pictures.

   There is a lot of webbing here, but it all comes down to money, and
   it’s easy to understand why both sides refused to give ground. Disney
   asked that future Spider-Man films be a 50/50 co-financing arrangement
   between the studios, and there were discussions that this might extend
   to other films in the Spider-Man universe. Sony turned that offer down
   flat. Sources said that Sony, led by Tom Rothman and Tony Vinciquerra,
   came back with other configurations, but Disney didn’t want to do that.
   But Sony did not want to share its biggest franchise. Sure Disney would
   be putting up half the funding, but the risk is in how much you are
   going to make back in profit. Disney wasn’t at all interested in
   continuing the current terms where Marvel receives in the range of 5%
   of first dollar gross, sources said.

   Now, it’s easy to say that Feige has enough on his plate, especially
   after taking control of the X-Men universe in the Fox acquisition,
   including the Deadpool franchise, along with architecting the next
   phase of the Marvel superhero universe and building movies and shows
   for Disney +. But I’m told Feige loves Spider-Man, arguably the biggest
   superhero character in the Marvel canon. He would have continued if
   Disney and Sony could have reached new deal terms.

   Essentially this means that Sony will have to try to win a championship
   without Michael Jordan. After all, Feige’s first decade at Marvel is
   largely unblemished and his consistency has been nothing short of
   historic: even George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson haven’t
   seen everything turn into a hit, and so maybe only James Cameron has
   the success record that Feige has achieved. But Feige has done it all
   in the last 10 years, producing and overseeing 23 superheros, with not
   a flop in the bunch.  They’ve all been number one openers that have
   collectively grossed $26.8 billion. Feige this year became the producer
   of the top grossing film ever for two studios — Sony and Disney — and
   he produced three of the top four highest grossing films this year in
   Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: Far From Home. This
   after scoring the first ever Best Picture Oscar nom for a superhero
   film last year with Black Panther. I can’t think of a Hollywood
   producer/executive who has done anything close to this.

   And the launch of the new iteration of Spider-Man was done brilliantly
   with Marvel’s support and help. It has been a boon to both studios. Tom
   Holland’s character was introduced in the Joe & Anthony Russo-directed
   2016 blockbuster Captain America: Civil War, the film that set up the
   two record breaking Avengers films. Sony’s first rebooted Spidey film,
   2017’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, rode that Marvel wave and grossed $880
   million worldwide, and then the webslinger was a key character in the
   two Avengers films, leading to the Spidey sequel that this week became
   Sony’s top grossing film ever.

   Sources said Disney’s top brass for the past several months has sought
   new terms for Feige and the Marvel cross-pollination to continue. As
   the Spider-Man relationship grew, Feige and Sony Pictures chief Tom
   Rothman spoke about the possibility of a wider involvement in the
   Sony-controlled Spider-man universe, which contains 900 characters.

   It is understandable that the fiscally shrewd Rothman would balk at
   giving up half of Sony’s biggest franchise to Marvel. After all, Marvel
   already owns the merchandising on Spider-Man. Does the Mouse really
   need half of the movie universe also? Sony so far has decided that as
   valuable as Feige is, Disney is asking too high a price.

   Sources said that Sony reasoned that they will be fine, without Feige.
   The creative template has been set on the Spider-Man films, and Watt
   and Holland are in place along with Amy Pascal, who became producer
   with Feige after she exited the executive suite after presiding over
   the previous Spider-man iterations directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb
   as Sony Pictures chief. And sources note that Venom was a problem
   picture and far from the polished product that grossed $856 million
   worldwide, until Rothman himself spent a good long time in the editing
   room helping to get it there.

   The Venom sequel is well underway with Andy Serkis directing Tom Hardy,
   and there is Morbius with Jared Leto, Kraven The Hunter, and another
   spinoff with the characters Silver Sable and Black Cat. And a Sinister
   Six film that got shelved. Sony, which once felt the ticking clock of
   generating a Spider-Man film every three or so years to prevent a
   rights reversion to Disney, now has plenty of pictures to make. And the
   studio also won the Best Animated Feature Oscar for Spider-Man: Into
   The Spider-Verse, a smash hit they made on their own.

   No comment from Marvel/Disney, Feige or Sony Pictures.

   Juan Antonio JA Bayona

   EXCLUSIVE: Amazon Studios’ high-profile The Lord of the Rings TV series
   has made a key hire. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom director Juan
   Antonio (J.A.) Bayona has been tapped to direct the first two episodes
   of the big-scope fantasy drama, following in the footsteps of Peter
   Jackson, who directed the feature adaptations of the classic J.R.R.
   Tolkien novels.

   Set in Middle-earth, the series will explore new storylines preceding
   Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring.

   “J.R.R. Tolkien created one of the most extraordinary and inspiring
   stories of all time, and as a lifelong fan it is an honor and a joy to
   join this amazing team,” said Bayona. “I can’t wait to take audiences
   around the world to Middle-earth and have them discover the wonders of
   the Second Age, with a never before seen story.”

   Bayona also will executive produce alongside his producing partner
   Belén Atienza.

   The Lord of the Rings series is written by feature scribes JD Payne and
   Patrick McKay. They lead a writers room, which is believed to include
   Breaking Bad alumna Gennifer Hutchison and Game of Thrones veteran
   Bryan Cogman, among others.

   “We are thrilled to have J.A. and Belén joining the fellowship as we
   continue to develop this epic series,” said Payne and McKay. “We have
   been great admirers of J.A.’s work for years, and know that his epic,
   cinematic and deeply heartfelt aesthetic is the perfect sensibility to
   bring Middle-earth to life anew.”

   Bayona’s first feature film, critically acclaimed thriller The
   Orphanage, executive produced by Guillermo del Toro, premiered to a
   10-minute standing ovation at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and later
   won seven Goya Awards in Spain, including best new director.

   2019 Amazon Pilots &amp; Series Orders

   Bayona most recently directed Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which
   grossed more than $1.3 billion worldwide last year. He also directed
   the features The Impossible, starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor,
   and A Monster Calls, starring Sigourney Weaver, Liam Neeson and
   Felicity Jones, as well as the first two episodes of Showtime’s hit
   series Penny Dreadful.

   “The scope and breadth of J.A.’s world-building is exactly the right
   fit for our ambitions for The Lord of the Rings,” said Jennifer Salke,
   Head of Amazon Studios. “He’s a passionate and collaborative director
   who has brought new stories to life with his multitalented producing
   partner, Belén. We are all excited for them to join our writers JD
   Payne and Patrick McKay, and we can’t think of a better way to begin
   this journey to Middle-earth.”

   The Lord of the Rings series, which has a multi-season commitment in a
   blockbuster nine-figure rights deal with the Tolkien estate, is
   produced by Amazon Studios in cooperation with the Tolkien Estate and
   Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros.
   Entertainment, which produced the 2000s Peter Jackson trilogy.

   Meredith Corp. has sold Sports Illustrated for $110 million to
   Authentic Brands Group, a global brand development, marketing and
   entertainment company that manages Juicy Couture, Nautica, and holds
   the licensing and trademark rights for celebrities such as Marilyn
   Monroe, Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali.

   Under terms of the deal, Authentic Brands Group (ABG) acquires the
   rights to market and license Sports Illustrated, its swimsuit edition,
   kids’ edition, “Sportsperson of the Year” and SI TV, along with the
   magazine’s photo archive. Meredith will continue to operate the Sports
   Illustrated print magazine and SI.com for a minimum of two years, and
   pay ABG a licensing fee.

   “We are honored to welcome Sports Illustrated to the ABG family,”
   Authentic Brands Founder, Chairman and CEO Jamie Salter said in a
   statement on Monday, May 27. “As one of the most iconic brands in
   sports media, SI is a cultural centerpiece with massive opportunities
   for growth across its burgeoning digital, TV and social platforms and
   industry-leading print magazine.”

   Added Meredith President Jon Werther: “We are delighted to find a great
   home for Sports Illustrated with ABG, one of the world’s premier brand
   owners and licensors.”

   The agreement does not include the FanSided digital platform, which
   Meredith is currently in the process of selling.

   Meredith acquired SI as part of its purchase of Time Inc. for $1.85
   billion on January 31, 2018, and immediately put Time magazine,
   Fortune, and Sports Illustrated up for sale.

   That left People and Entertainment Weekly as prominent titles staying
   in the fold at Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith, whose portfolio
   includes female-skewing consumer titles like Better Homes and Gardens.

   Joker Poster
   Warner Bros

   Warner Bros. has responded to the note this morning from five of the
   300-plus Aurora, Colorado victim base expressing concerns over the
   release of the movie Joker on Oct. 4.

   Says a Warner Bros. rep: “Gun violence in our society is a critical
   issue, and we extend our deepest sympathy to all victims and families
   impacted by these tragedies. Our company has a long history of donating
   to victims of violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our
   parent company joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to
   enact bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic. At the same
   time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling
   is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues. Make no
   mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an
   endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention
   of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as
   a hero.“

'Joker' Will Not Play At Aurora Theater Where 2012 'Dark Knight Rises'
Shooting Occurred; Some Victims' Families Call On Warner Bros To Back Gun
Reform

   Earlier today, a letter obtained by the rival Hollywood trades,
   addressed to Warner Media Chairperson and CEO Ann Sarnoff, was issued
   from five family members who were impacted by the July 20, 2012 Dark
   Night Rises shootings at the Century 16 (a Cinemark) in Aurora: Sandy
   and Lonnie Phillips who lost their daughter Jessica Ghawi; Theresa
   Hoover who lost her 18-year-old son Alexander J. Boik; Heather Dearman,
   whose cousin Ashley Moser, lost an unborn child and a 6-year-old
   daughter in the attack; and Tiina Coon, whose son witnessed the
   shootings.

   The five family members, who are not speaking on behalf of all the
   victims, called on Warners, “to use your massive platform and influence
   to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.”

   Following the 2012 massacre, Warner Bros. donated $2 million to the
   victims and the survivors of the Aurora shooting.

   Although reports surfaced soon after the Dark Knight Rises shooting in
   the media that the gunman was inspired by the Joker character, that was
   proven false in evidence presented in court by the shooter’s own words
   to a psychiatrist.

   Both Warner Bros. and Cinemark decided that Joker, which follows a
   disturbed outsider who gets hold of a gun and causes havoc in Gotham,
   will not play at the Cinemark Aurora Century Theater, the site where
   the Dark Knight Rises shootings occurred.

   Gabriel Luna as Ghost Rider

   EXCLUSIVE: Hulu has opted not to proceed with Marvel’s Ghost Rider, its
   planned live-action series starring Gabriel Luna, I have learned.

   See All

   Hulu in May picked up two new live-action series from Disney sibling
   Marvel Television, Ghost Rider and Helstrom, to premiere in 2020. While
   Marvel’s Helstrom is on track, I hear Hulu and the Ghost Rider team had
   reached a creative impasse which could not be resolved, leading to the
   streamer’s decision not to move forward with the series.
   Marvel

   Marvel Television remains a leading supplier to Hulu with a series
   slate that includes the live-action Marvel’s Runaways, which has been
   renewed for a third season, and the upcoming Marvel’s Helstrom, both
   co-produced by ABC Signature. It also in involved in a suite of four
   connected animated series — Marvel’s M.O.D.O.K, Marvel’s Hit-Monkey,
   Marvel’s Tigra & Dazzler Show and Marvel’s Howard the Duck  — set to
   roll out in 2020, culminating in a special event, Marvel’s The
   Offenders.

   Marvel’s Ghost Rider is executive produced by Stephen Lightfoot, who
   was to serve as showrunner, Paul Zbyszewski and Marvel TV’s Jeph Loeb.
   It is unclear whether the series will be shopped elsewhere.

   The antihero Ghost Rider, also known as Robbie Reyes, is consumed by
   hellfire and supernaturally bound to a demon. Reyes lives on the
   Texas-Mexico border and when he unleashes the Rider, Robbie brings
   vengeance for the innocents he encounters, but struggles to control the
   power he wields. The character was brought back to the Marvel Universe
   in 2016 on ABC’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the Robbie Reyes version,
   played by Luna.

   In 2007, Sony and Marvel released a feature film based on the
   motorcycle rider with a flaming skull, directed by Mark Steven Johnson
   and starring Nicolas Cage as the Johnny Blaze version of the titular
   antihero.

   UPDATED at 8:55p.m. PT with Sony response: Sony Pictures spent much of
   yesterday putting its perspective on the prospective loss of Kevin
   Feige from future Spider-Man films. First the studio downplayed the
   idea he might be leaving; then insiders pinned his exit on added
   responsibilities from the Fox acquisition of the X-Men franchise,
   though they declined to make a statement. All this was reflected as
   factors in Deadline’s break of an important and widely regurgitated
   story. But sources maintain that Feige’s exit was about money; it was
   about Disney seeking the 50/50 co-fi stake (sources said the original
   Disney ask was more reasonable) as the price for Marvel and Feige’s
   continued guiding hand that resulted in the delivery of Sony’s biggest
   grossing film ever. Sony declined to meet those terms or even counter
   with anything worth considering. It was an aggressive stance by Disney,
   which already owns the merchandise on Spider-Man, and a tough nut for
   Sony to swallow, giving up half of its most valuable franchise. But
   these talks had been going on for some time. Had Sony agreed to
   Disney’s ask, Marvel and Feige would not have withdrawn from the
   Spider-Man films, sources said.

   Sony issued a statement late in the evening, not denying anything
   Deadline revealed yesterday, but reiterating its stance that Feige was
   too busy. Deadline stands squarely behind its reporting. How important
   is Feige to the future of this franchise? We’ll find out down the line.
   Sony is planning two more installments, though it is an open question
   whether those will include Jon Watts, director of the first two films
   guided creatively by Feige. Watts isn’t signed on for the next film and
   isn’t a certainty to be back as he is being heavily courted for other
   jobs. Could Sony find itself vying against Marvel for Watts’ future
   services as director? Here is Sony’s late evening statement:  “Much of
   today’s news about Spider-Man has mischaracterized recent discussions
   about Kevin Feige’s involvement in the franchise. We are disappointed,
   but respect Disney’s decision not to have him continue as a lead
   producer of our next live action Spider-Man film,” a Sony spokesperson
   said. “We hope this might change in the future, but understand that the
   many new responsibilities that Disney has given him – including all
   their newly added Marvel properties – do not allow time for him to work
   on IP they do not own. Kevin is terrific and we are grateful for his
   help and guidance and appreciate the path he has helped put us on,
   which we will continue.”

   PREVIOUS DEADLINE EXCLUSIVE: Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige won’t
   produce any further Spider-Man films because of an inability by Disney
   and Sony Pictures to reach new terms that would have given the former a
   co-financing stake going forward. A dispute that has taken place over
   the past few months at the top of Disney and Sony has essentially nixed
   Feige, and the future involvement of Marvel from the Spider-Man
   universe, sources said.

   This comes at a moment when the last two films Kevin Feige produced
   broke all-time records — Disney’s Avengers: Endgame became the highest
   grossing film of all time, and Spider-Man: Far From Home this week
   surpassed the James Bond film Skyfall to become the all time highest
   grossing film for Sony Pictures.
   Spider-Man: Far From Home Spider-Man: Far From Home Columbia Pictures

   Sources said there are two more Spider-Man films in the works and the
   studio hopes to have director Jon Watts and Tom Holland front and
   center, though Watts doesn’t have a deal for the next picture and isn’t
   a lock to return. That isn’t helped by that fact that, unless something
   dramatic happens, Feige won’t be the lead creative producer of those
   pictures.

   There is a lot of webbing here, but it all comes down to money, and
   it’s easy to understand why both sides refused to give ground. Disney
   asked that future Spider-Man films be a 50/50 co-financing arrangement
   between the studios, and there were discussions that this might extend
   to other films in the Spider-Man universe. Sony turned that offer down
   flat. Sources said that Sony, led by Tom Rothman and Tony Vinciquerra,
   came back with other configurations, but Disney didn’t want to do that.
   But Sony did not want to share its biggest franchise. Sure Disney would
   be putting up half the funding, but the risk is in how much you are
   going to make back in profit. Disney wasn’t at all interested in
   continuing the current terms where Marvel receives in the range of 5%
   of first dollar gross, sources said.

   Now, it’s easy to say that Feige has enough on his plate, especially
   after taking control of the X-Men universe in the Fox acquisition,
   including the Deadpool franchise, along with architecting the next
   phase of the Marvel superhero universe and building movies and shows
   for Disney +. But I’m told Feige loves Spider-Man, arguably the biggest
   superhero character in the Marvel canon. He would have continued if
   Disney and Sony could have reached new deal terms.

   Essentially this means that Sony will have to try to win a championship
   without Michael Jordan. After all, Feige’s first decade at Marvel is
   largely unblemished and his consistency has been nothing short of
   historic: even George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson haven’t
   seen everything turn into a hit, and so maybe only James Cameron has
   the success record that Feige has achieved. But Feige has done it all
   in the last 10 years, producing and overseeing 23 superheros, with not
   a flop in the bunch.  They’ve all been number one openers that have
   collectively grossed $26.8 billion. Feige this year became the producer
   of the top grossing film ever for two studios — Sony and Disney — and
   he produced three of the top four highest grossing films this year in
   Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: Far From Home. This
   after scoring the first ever Best Picture Oscar nom for a superhero
   film last year with Black Panther. I can’t think of a Hollywood
   producer/executive who has done anything close to this.

   And the launch of the new iteration of Spider-Man was done brilliantly
   with Marvel’s support and help. It has been a boon to both studios. Tom
   Holland’s character was introduced in the Joe & Anthony Russo-directed
   2016 blockbuster Captain America: Civil War, the film that set up the
   two record breaking Avengers films. Sony’s first rebooted Spidey film,
   2017’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, rode that Marvel wave and grossed $880
   million worldwide, and then the webslinger was a key character in the
   two Avengers films, leading to the Spidey sequel that this week became
   Sony’s top grossing film ever.

   Sources said Disney’s top brass for the past several months has sought
   new terms for Feige and the Marvel cross-pollination to continue. As
   the Spider-Man relationship grew, Feige and Sony Pictures chief Tom
   Rothman spoke about the possibility of a wider involvement in the
   Sony-controlled Spider-man universe, which contains 900 characters.

   It is understandable that the fiscally shrewd Rothman would balk at
   giving up half of Sony’s biggest franchise to Marvel. After all, Marvel
   already owns the merchandising on Spider-Man. Does the Mouse really
   need half of the movie universe also? Sony so far has decided that as
   valuable as Feige is, Disney is asking too high a price.

   Sources said that Sony reasoned that they will be fine, without Feige.
   The creative template has been set on the Spider-Man films, and Watt
   and Holland are in place along with Amy Pascal, who became producer
   with Feige after she exited the executive suite after presiding over
   the previous Spider-man iterations directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb
   as Sony Pictures chief. And sources note that Venom was a problem
   picture and far from the polished product that grossed $856 million
   worldwide, until Rothman himself spent a good long time in the editing
   room helping to get it there.

   The Venom sequel is well underway with Andy Serkis directing Tom Hardy,
   and there is Morbius with Jared Leto, Kraven The Hunter, and another
   spinoff with the characters Silver Sable and Black Cat. And a Sinister
   Six film that got shelved. Sony, which once felt the ticking clock of
   generating a Spider-Man film every three or so years to prevent a
   rights reversion to Disney, now has plenty of pictures to make. And the
   studio also won the Best Animated Feature Oscar for Spider-Man: Into
   The Spider-Verse, a smash hit they made on their own.

   No comment from Marvel/Disney, Feige or Sony Pictures.

   Juan Antonio JA Bayona

   EXCLUSIVE: Amazon Studios’ high-profile The Lord of the Rings TV series
   has made a key hire. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom director Juan
   Antonio (J.A.) Bayona has been tapped to direct the first two episodes
   of the big-scope fantasy drama, following in the footsteps of Peter
   Jackson, who directed the feature adaptations of the classic J.R.R.
   Tolkien novels.

   Set in Middle-earth, the series will explore new storylines preceding
   Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring.

   “J.R.R. Tolkien created one of the most extraordinary and inspiring
   stories of all time, and as a lifelong fan it is an honor and a joy to
   join this amazing team,” said Bayona. “I can’t wait to take audiences
   around the world to Middle-earth and have them discover the wonders of
   the Second Age, with a never before seen story.”

   Bayona also will executive produce alongside his producing partner
   Belén Atienza.

   The Lord of the Rings series is written by feature scribes JD Payne and
   Patrick McKay. They lead a writers room, which is believed to include
   Breaking Bad alumna Gennifer Hutchison and Game of Thrones veteran
   Bryan Cogman, among others.

   “We are thrilled to have J.A. and Belén joining the fellowship as we
   continue to develop this epic series,” said Payne and McKay. “We have
   been great admirers of J.A.’s work for years, and know that his epic,
   cinematic and deeply heartfelt aesthetic is the perfect sensibility to
   bring Middle-earth to life anew.”

   Bayona’s first feature film, critically acclaimed thriller The
   Orphanage, executive produced by Guillermo del Toro, premiered to a
   10-minute standing ovation at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and later
   won seven Goya Awards in Spain, including best new director.

   2019 Amazon Pilots &amp; Series Orders

   Bayona most recently directed Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which
   grossed more than $1.3 billion worldwide last year. He also directed
   the features The Impossible, starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor,
   and A Monster Calls, starring Sigourney Weaver, Liam Neeson and
   Felicity Jones, as well as the first two episodes of Showtime’s hit
   series Penny Dreadful.

   “The scope and breadth of J.A.’s world-building is exactly the right
   fit for our ambitions for The Lord of the Rings,” said Jennifer Salke,
   Head of Amazon Studios. “He’s a passionate and collaborative director
   who has brought new stories to life with his multitalented producing
   partner, Belén. We are all excited for them to join our writers JD
   Payne and Patrick McKay, and we can’t think of a better way to begin
   this journey to Middle-earth.”

   The Lord of the Rings series, which has a multi-season commitment in a
   blockbuster nine-figure rights deal with the Tolkien estate, is
   produced by Amazon Studios in cooperation with the Tolkien Estate and
   Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros.
   Entertainment, which produced the 2000s Peter Jackson trilogy.

   Meredith Corp. has sold Sports Illustrated for $110 million to
   Authentic Brands Group, a global brand development, marketing and
   entertainment company that manages Juicy Couture, Nautica, and holds
   the licensing and trademark rights for celebrities such as Marilyn
   Monroe, Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali.

   Under terms of the deal, Authentic Brands Group (ABG) acquires the
   rights to market and license Sports Illustrated, its swimsuit edition,
   kids’ edition, “Sportsperson of the Year” and SI TV, along with the
   magazine’s photo archive. Meredith will continue to operate the Sports
   Illustrated print magazine and SI.com for a minimum of two years, and
   pay ABG a licensing fee.

   “We are honored to welcome Sports Illustrated to the ABG family,”
   Authentic Brands Founder, Chairman and CEO Jamie Salter said in a
   statement on Monday, May 27. “As one of the most iconic brands in
   sports media, SI is a cultural centerpiece with massive opportunities
   for growth across its burgeoning digital, TV and social platforms and
   industry-leading print magazine.”

   Added Meredith President Jon Werther: “We are delighted to find a great
   home for Sports Illustrated with ABG, one of the world’s premier brand
   owners and licensors.”

   The agreement does not include the FanSided digital platform, which
   Meredith is currently in the process of selling.

   Meredith acquired SI as part of its purchase of Time Inc. for $1.85
   billion on January 31, 2018, and immediately put Time magazine,
   Fortune, and Sports Illustrated up for sale.

   That left People and Entertainment Weekly as prominent titles staying
   in the fold at Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith, whose portfolio
   includes female-skewing consumer titles like Better Homes and Gardens.

   Joker Poster
   Warner Bros

   Warner Bros. has responded to the note this morning from five of the
   300-plus Aurora, Colorado victim base expressing concerns over the
   release of the movie Joker on Oct. 4.

   Says a Warner Bros. rep: “Gun violence in our society is a critical
   issue, and we extend our deepest sympathy to all victims and families
   impacted by these tragedies. Our company has a long history of donating
   to victims of violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our
   parent company joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to
   enact bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic. At the same
   time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling
   is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues. Make no
   mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an
   endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention
   of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as
   a hero.“

'Joker' Will Not Play At Aurora Theater Where 2012 'Dark Knight Rises'
Shooting Occurred; Some Victims' Families Call On Warner Bros To Back Gun
Reform

   Earlier today, a letter obtained by the rival Hollywood trades,
   addressed to Warner Media Chairperson and CEO Ann Sarnoff, was issued
   from five family members who were impacted by the July 20, 2012 Dark
   Night Rises shootings at the Century 16 (a Cinemark) in Aurora: Sandy
   and Lonnie Phillips who lost their daughter Jessica Ghawi; Theresa
   Hoover who lost her 18-year-old son Alexander J. Boik; Heather Dearman,
   whose cousin Ashley Moser, lost an unborn child and a 6-year-old
   daughter in the attack; and Tiina Coon, whose son witnessed the
   shootings.

   The five family members, who are not speaking on behalf of all the
   victims, called on Warners, “to use your massive platform and influence
   to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.”

   Following the 2012 massacre, Warner Bros. donated $2 million to the
   victims and the survivors of the Aurora shooting.

   Although reports surfaced soon after the Dark Knight Rises shooting in
   the media that the gunman was inspired by the Joker character, that was
   proven false in evidence presented in court by the shooter’s own words
   to a psychiatrist.

   Both Warner Bros. and Cinemark decided that Joker, which follows a
   disturbed outsider who gets hold of a gun and causes havoc in Gotham,
   will not play at the Cinemark Aurora Century Theater, the site where
   the Dark Knight Rises shootings occurred.

   Gabriel Luna as Ghost Rider
   Jennifer Clasen/ABC

   EXCLUSIVE: Hulu has opted not to proceed with Marvel’s Ghost Rider, its
   planned live-action series starring Gabriel Luna, I have learned.

   Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders
   See All

   Hulu in May picked up two new live-action series from Disney sibling
   Marvel Television, Ghost Rider and Helstrom, to premiere in 2020. While
   Marvel’s Helstrom is on track, I hear Hulu and the Ghost Rider team had
   reached a creative impasse which could not be resolved, leading to the
   streamer’s decision not to move forward with the series.
   Marvel

   Marvel Television remains a leading supplier to Hulu with a series
   slate that includes the live-action Marvel’s Runaways, which has been
   renewed for a third season, and the upcoming Marvel’s Helstrom, both
   co-produced by ABC Signature. It also in involved in a suite of four
   connected animated series — Marvel’s M.O.D.O.K, Marvel’s Hit-Monkey,
   Marvel’s Tigra & Dazzler Show and Marvel’s Howard the Duck  — set to
   roll out in 2020, culminating in a special event, Marvel’s The
   Offenders.

   Marvel’s Ghost Rider is executive produced by Stephen Lightfoot, who
   was to serve as showrunner, Paul Zbyszewski and Marvel TV’s Jeph Loeb.
   It is unclear whether the series will be shopped elsewhere.

   The antihero Ghost Rider, also known as Robbie Reyes, is consumed by
   hellfire and supernaturally bound to a demon. Reyes lives on the
   Texas-Mexico border and when he unleashes the Rider, Robbie brings
   vengeance for the innocents he encounters, but struggles to control the
   power he wields. The character was brought back to the Marvel Universe
   in 2016 on ABC’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the Robbie Reyes version,
   played by Luna.

   In 2007, Sony and Marvel released a feature film based on the
   motorcycle rider with a flaming skull, directed by Mark Steven Johnson
   and starring Nicolas Cage as the Johnny Blaze version of the titular
   antihero.

   BBC Two

   With Peaky Blinders heading into its fourth season on BBC Two beginning
   November 15 in the UK, creator Steven Knight and core cast members
   including Cillian Murphy, Paul Anderson and Helen McCrory recently
   shared their thoughts about the latest installment in the lives of the
   Shelby family, as well as the future of the series and a possible
   transfer to the big screen (says Knight, “Peaky is now a beast that
   will not die”). On a visit to the Peaky set, I also spoke with new cast
   member Adrien Brody.

   The plot of Season 4 has been held pretty close to the vest, but it
   kicks off with Tommy Shelby estranged from his family after an intense
   Season 3 ending that saw him turn the tables and have them all
   arrested. This season, it’s back to the family’s roots. When Tommy
   realizes they are in danger of annihilation, he flees his country house
   and summons the family to return to the streets of Small Heath, where a
   desperate fight for survival begins.

   Murphy says that at the beginning of Season 4, “Tommy is trying to
   convince himself it’s okay. He’s trying to live with it and what
   happened to the rest of them. He’s not the sort of character who’s
   going to go to therapy… It’s an interesting place to find him
   completely estranged; family was his raison d’etre.” He also sees
   similarities to the first season. “These circumstances and the threat
   from outside mean the family has to regroup again and become good at
   what they were good at in series one. Obviously all the characters are
   older and all this water’s gone under the bridge, but I see a lot of
   parallels to series one and I think I do see as Tommy gets older in
   terms of his legacy and values and principals, if they were sort of
   atrophied within him, you can see them sort of beginning to stir.”

   McCrory (Aunt Polly) added at a recent press screening of episode one,
   “They’re all united against something you hate and fear. They have to
   get together to defend themselves.” It’s good news for Anderson’s
   Arthur Shelby who, the actor says, “would much rather be at Tommy’s
   side.”

   When I earlier caught up with the Blinders gang on set, they were
   filming scenes of a cat-and-mouse game between Tommy and Brody’s mafia
   scion who’s come to town from New York to seek revenge for the murder
   of his father. Murphy explained Tommy is “using the back streets of
   Birmingham where he grew up to lure them in.”

   Brody’s mobster cuts a sinister and menacing figure when he first
   appears. I’m told he also shares some parallels with Tommy, which will
   become more evident as the season rolls along.

   Brody told me, “There is a sense of respect that goes into what
   (Tommy’s) built, but things have to be set right. It’s an old-world
   kind of thing. There’s always retribution, people don’t forgive. There
   are a lot of parallels in both families that each character can relate
   to the other in a sense.”

   Exec producer Jamie Glazebrook (of series producer Caryn Mandabach
   Productions) noted that Brody’s character has “elements where it’s a
   mirror of Tommy. He also has a family who kind of disappoint and he
   also has an intellect and isn’t 100% comfortable with being a gangster.
   So what he brings is extraordinary.”

   As for Game Of Thrones’ alum Aidan Gillen’s role as Aberama Gold,
   Knight says, “If you’re threatened by the devil, you get a devil of
   your own.” Gillen’s character is “the devil you know.” Gillen himself
   has said Gold, “is a Romany gypsy with a reputation for being a
   dangerous man, somebody who is a kind of unknown quantity… some kind of
   a showman… a larger than life figure. Aberama is a man of his word, so
   he can be trusted to stick to his side of the deal, but he can also be
   trusted to ensure that nobody is attempting to get out of their side of
   the deal.”

   This season also introduces Charlie Murphy as Jessie Eden, the trade
   union activist who made history in the 1920s fighting for equal pay for
   women. Cillian Murphy says, “Politically, it gets very interesting
   between the two characters and I think she really shines a light on
   Tommy because he’s sort of very unpolitical in many respects. He’s a
   capitalist, but she begins to provoke that a bit.”

   And, Charlotte Riley is back as May Carleton. I asked Knight if she and
   Tommy will start up again and he demurred, “It depends what you mean by
   ‘start up,’ but there will definitely be a relationship.” Murphy added
   that viewers, “might get a little surprise.”

   Riley’s real-life husband, Tom Hardy, returns again as Alfie Solomons
   for a “showdown” with Tommy, says Murphy. Says Knight, “Alfie doesn’t
   change. He’ll be back and do his thing.”

   Looking ahead, Season 5 will be set in 1928 and 1929. Knight tells me,
   “That was the time of the early days of fascism in England which will
   make it quite of its time and of this time. It involves the royal
   family and Tory politics; it’s when Italy and Germany were sort of
   kicking off.”

   Although there have been suggestions that Season 5 will be the end of
   the run for Peaky, Knight today tells me, “The thought has long been to
   finish after Season 5, but the momentum and love for the thing seems to
   still be growing exponentially and this is making us pause before
   deciding finally.”

   Does Murphy think there’s going to be a sixth season? He laughs,
   telling me, “Listen, you know Steve has so many ideas, he’s so
   inventive, I wouldn’t be surprised. For me, I’ve always said as long as
   the writing stays as good as it is, I’m around.”

   What about plans for a film, and a mooted stage musical? Per Knight,
   “We are also keeping our minds open as regards a movie and we are
   making progress on the musical. Peaky is now a beast that will not
   die.”

   Murphy on a movie: “In theory, yeah absolutely if the writing is as
   good as it is for the show then for sure.” But the musical? “That’s not
   for me, I’m going to pass on that one.”

   Returning to the current season, Knight has said he wrote Brody’s role
   with the Oscar-winning actor in mind. It’s no secret that famous folk
   often offer up their services to the period gangster epic with the
   globally rabid fanbase, but Knight isn’t into stunt casting. “We get
   incoming from the most amazing actors that want to be in it, but what
   we don’t want to do is turn it into this celebrity show. And most of
   them are American, so it’s difficult to get them in. But when you have
   this list of possibilities in front of you…”

   Brody for his part told me he hadn’t seen all of the series before
   signing on, but when he got the call, “It was very exciting news, and
   then more exciting when I read the season.” He calls Peaky “a really
   special show. It’s amazing, once I got wind of it and started talking
   to friends — everybody I talk to knows about it.”

   Knight concurs, In Hollywood, he says, “I can’t get off the topic. If I
   go to any meeting anywhere with anybody you can’t get off the topic.”
   He also marvels that although Netflix (which airs Peaky in the U.S.)
   doesn’t share viewing figures, he has learned that Peaky reached No. 1
   in both Rhode Island and Montana last year. “What have they got in
   common?,” he wonders.

   Knight promises “a surprise” at the end of this current season. “I
   think they pay a big cost. As this series develops there will be
   losses. But I’m not a believer in pulling a prominent character’s death
   out of the bag in order to get people to talk about it because I think
   it’s a law of diminishing returns.”

   He makes no bones about seeing each progressive season of Peaky as its
   best yet. I asked Murphy what he thinks. “Well, it would be foolish to
   embark on it if you didn’t think that was going to be the case because
   it’s foolish to embark on any job I think unless you think it’s going
   to be your best work. I think for me, television shows only succeed if
   they sort of increase in service to confidence and storytelling and I
   think that this certainly is the case with our show.”

   “I mean, if you could bottle it,” he added, “we’d all be geniuses.”

   The House Intelligence Committee released a whistleblower’s complaint
   over President Donald Trump’s interactions with the president of
   Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.

   The whistleblower, whose name is being kept confidential, reported
   receiving “information from multiple U.S. government officials that the
   president of the United States is using the power of his office to
   solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.
   This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign
   country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political
   rivals.”

   In the complaint, the whistleblower also names Trump’s personal lawyer,
   Rudy Giuliani, as a “central figure” in the effort, and that Attorney
   General William Barr “appears to be involved as well.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Announces Formal Trump Impeachment Inquiry

   The release of the complaint was the latest twist in a fast-moving
   scandal, one that already has compelled House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to
   announce an impeachment investigation of Trump.

   On Wednesday, the White House released a non-verbatim transcript notes
   of a July 25 conversation that Trump had with Zelensky, in which the
   president asks him to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

   Broadcast and cable news networks today were providing live coverage of
   an intelligence committee hearing in which Joseph Maguire, the acting
   director of national intelligence, is testifying. Democrats on the
   committee want to know why the whistleblower complaint was not quickly
   turned over to Congress.

   “This complaint is a roadmap for our investigation, and provides
   significant information for the committee to follow up on with other
   witnesses and documents,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of
   the committee. “And it is corroborated by the call record released
   yesterday.”

   The complaint, dated on August 12, can be viewed here.

   The whistleblower said in the complaint, “I was not a direct witness to
   most of the events described.” But it is based on colleagues accounts
   of events found credible because, “in almost all cases, multiple
   officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one
   another.”

   The whistleblower wrote that the White House officials who relayed
   information about the call were “deeply disturbed by what transpired.”

   “They told me that there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White
   House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in
   the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse
   his office for personal gain,” the whistleblower wrote.

   Skin is the true-life story of reformed white-supremacist Bryon Widner
   (played by Jamie Bell) a young man raised by skinheads, for whom
   turning his back on hatred and violence meant undergoing painful and
   expensive operations to remove the tattoos that signified his terrible
   past life — a process only possible with the support of a Black
   activist.

   Based on his short of the same name, writer/director Guy Nattiv talked
   to Deadline about how Bryon’s story hit close to him.

   “Because I grew up in Israel with grandfather stories about the
   Holocaust and about Nazism and the whole fascism that he went through.
   For me to see to see someone who went through it in another way, a
   different way, and this journey that this guy made touched me.”

   He continued, “My grandfather told me about how he started to forgive
   the second and third generation of Germans and forgiveness is something
   that we really cherish in our family, it’s a value he gave us. So I
   felt a lot of forgiveness to Bryon.”

   The film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International
   Film Festival, also stars Danielle Macdonald and Bill Camp, both of
   whom accompanied Nattiv’s at Deadline’s TIFF studio, as well as Mike
   Colter and Vera Farmiga.

   See the full interview above.

   Deadline Studio at TIFF 2018 presented by eOne. Special thanks to
   sponsor Watford Group, and partners Calii Love, Love Child Social,
   and Barocco Coffee.
