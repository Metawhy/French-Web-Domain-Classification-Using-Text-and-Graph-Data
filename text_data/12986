TSC IntelBrief: A Contradiction in U.S. North Korean Policy

   Bottom Line Up Front

   • During an October 27 visit to South Korea, U.S. Defense Secretary
   James Mattis called for a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.

   • Unlike deterrence, denuclearization would require North Korea to give
   up what it considers to be its strongest defense against the threat of
   regime change.

   • Some official U.S. statements fail to reflect the fact that North
   Korea has possessed a robust nuclear weapons program for more than a
   decade.

   • With rhetoric and shows of force, the U.S is trying to bring
   Pyongyang to the negotiating table without going too far as to provoke
   a military response.


   On October 27, amid rising tensions between Washington D.C. and
   Pyongyang, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis visited South Korea. The
   visit was meant to show a unified front between Washington and Seoul,
   in the ongoing confrontation with North Korea over its nuclear
   weapons and ballistic missile programs. Standing at perhaps the world’s
   most definitive border, the de-militarized zone (DMZ) between the two
   Koreas, Secretary Mattis called for ‘the complete, verifiable and
   irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.’ Secretary
   Mattis’ call was consistent with some statements U.S. officials have
   made on North Korea’s nuclear program, while contradicting others.
   The North Korean crisis finds the U.S. bouncing somewhat unpredictably
   between deterrence and denuclearization; two very different
   national-security policy goals with very different approaches and
   likelihoods of success.

   Since taking office, President Donald Trump has tweeted or stated
   several times that the U.S. would not allow North Korea to possess
   nuclear weapons — despite the fact that North Korea first tested a
   nuclear device in 2006. To date, Pyongyang has tested nuclear devices
   six times, including a thermonuclear test in September 2017.
   Pyongyang’s successful pursuit of an effective nuclear weapons
   capability has hardly been clandestine; the country touts every
   advancement as a way to ensure its survival while also threatening to
   destroy the United States. Such hyperbolic taunts become more real with
   each successful North Korean ballistic missile test; the U.S. is deeply
   concerned with those advances as it works to properly asses the threat.

   The fact that Pyongyang became a nuclear power, after a long and openly
   stated commitment to do just that, makes calls for the ‘irreversible
   denuclearization’ of North Korea problematic at the very least;
   certainly, in terms of achieving that goal diplomatically. In addition,
   the Kim Jong-Un regime undoubtedly recalls the fall of the Gaddafi
   regime, after Libya gave up its nascent nuclear program, and is witness
   to the latest U.S. threats to walk away from its multi-lateral nuclear
   agreement with Iran. Given those realities, the idea that North Korea’s
   ruling regime would surrender what it considers to be the prime
   deterrent factor preventing the U.S. from removing it from power, is
   unrealistic. In geopolitical conflict resolution at this level,
   presenting one’s adversary solely with unrealistic demands is a recipe
   for frustration and even disaster.

   The U.S. is caught between two mutually exclusive policy stances:
   deterring a nuclear-armed North Korea, while somehow forcing Pyongyang
   to get rid of its nuclear weapons. The issue with deterrence is that
   North Korea’s dangerous rhetoric can no longer be dismissed as
   cartoonish propaganda, because despite warhead re-entry and targeting
   issues, its improving ballistic missile delivery capability is very
   much a reality. Deterrence is difficult to maintain when one party with
   a credible nuclear weapon regularly threatens to use it against
   another. (While the U.S. and the former Soviet Union avoided mutually
   assured destruction despite engaging in periodic confrontations for
   decades, they also came to the brink of war during the Cuban Missile
   Crisis in 1962 and had other, lesser-known, scares.)

   The U.S is trying to bring North Korea to the negotiating table with
   rhetoric and shows of force, without going too far as to provoke a
   military response. However, Pyongyang might very well see U.S.
   statements calling for denuclearization as warnings regime change could
   follow, if it fails to acquiesce. A U.S. pre-emptive strike on the Kim
   regime is — hopefully — unlikely, given a lack of military options that
   wouldn’t result in the destruction of Seoul, a city of nearly ten
   million people. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomatic stances that waver between
   deterrence and denuclearization are keeping the nuclear issue at a
   boil; precisely the opposite goal if Washington hopes to set the stage
   for effective negotiations.
