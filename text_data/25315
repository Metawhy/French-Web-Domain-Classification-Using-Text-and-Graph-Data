Privacy Policy


   Last updated: September 24, 2018

   Permutive, Inc. (“Permutive”) is committed to protecting the privacy of
   our site visitors and customers. Permutive team members are customers
   themselves of other Internet sites and fully appreciate and respect the
   importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information
   about our customers to third parties except where it is part of
   providing a service to you—e.g. arranging for a product to be sent to
   you, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes
   of customer research and profiling or where we have your express
   permission to do so.

What Permutive Collects

   We collect all event data sent to our API by the data controller. In
   general, these events are used to analyze trends, and track users’
   movements around a customer’s product. We receive events on an
   individual as well as aggregated basis. Our partners may also use such
   technologies to deliver advertisements to you. The data we receive for
   a user is completely anonymized, unless they are logged-in and the
   customer has asked us to link their data to their login. Event data is
   never shared between customers.

   Customer information is collected through the use of forms (e.g.
   registration form) or from interaction with the Customer such as in
   connection with support request, in which case information is collected
   from electronic or phone communications.

   Users’ IP addresses are received and processed at our API to estimate a
   user’s location, but raw IP addresses are not stored.

Cookie Policy

   Permutive uses first-party cookies to identify website users. A cookie
   is a small information file that is sent to your computer, mobile or
   other device when you visit a website and it will recognise your device
   on future visits. Users can configure their web browser to reject these
   cookies—or all cookies—and Permutive will no longer collect information
   for them.

Security

   Permutive is committed to protecting the security of your information.
   We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and
   procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access,
   use, or disclosure, including limiting access to the data within
   Permutive. Despite these measures, you should know that Permutive
   cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with your information
   and mistakes may happen.

Opt-out

   Users can opt out of Permutive by running the following JavaScript
   command on any site that uses Permutive.
permutive.consent({ "opt_in": false });

   We cannot provide a catch-all mechanism to opt out of all Permutive
   deployments since we do not use third-party cookies that persist across
   domains for identification.

   Permutive's platform gives publishers an in-the-moment view of everyone
   on their site. So they can see more value from more of their users,
   with data updated in milliseconds.
   It's fundamentally fast, and it's just one of the use cases for our
   core technology. To transform publishing, we also had to transform
   processing.

Look past the
cloud. Live on
the edge.

   Permutive is built using edge computing. Where data is processed on the
   device that generates it, rather than a remote server in the cloud.

   The number of connected chips and sensors has exploded. The cloud just
   wasn’t built for this much data. When each device processes what it
   generates, we can bypass the cloud and unlock game-changing
   possibilities.

Built for the
next trillion
devices

   From driverless cars to data management platforms, everyone benefits
   from edge-based processing.

Immediate outcomes

   Once you're no longer waiting for the cloud to get back to you, you can
   actually start to act in the moment

Perfect aim

   With no bandwidth restrictions, edge processing opens up more data for
   more accurate conclusions.

Safe by design

   Since everything happens off the network, people's personal information
   never leaves their devices.

Unique publishers, unique outcomes

   We team up with publishers to see how our edge-based platform can best
   drive their business. Then we work alongside them to see their
   ambitions turn into outcomes.
   That might be tracking users only using first-party cookies. Targeting
   content on the very first visit, to all users. Or finally being able to
   identify hidden users. Yes, everything's powered by the edge - but no
   two Permutive approaches are the same.

135%

more ad revenue in one month

4x

increase in audience identification from 20% → 80%

7x

increase in targetable inventory

   We applied our edge-based platform to Immediate Media's network,
   creating a first-party cookie approach that targeted their entire
   audience with a 100% match rate. They used it to create and activate
   segments that update every second instead of every day.
   Immediate Media used to identify only 20% of their target audience, as
   their old DMP relied on third-party cookies which were blocked by
   default in many browsers.
