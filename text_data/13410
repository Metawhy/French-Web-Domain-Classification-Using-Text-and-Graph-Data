   By G. John Cole July 30, 2019

   The final academic year of the decade is a pivotal moment for higher

   Online learning is no longer new -- the difference is that it has
   become a mainstream option for students and educators alike. One-third

Higher education possibilities around the world

   Postgraduate studies, whether master’s degrees, MBAs or short courses,
   are becoming increasingly common in our modern economy characterized by
   specialization and globalization. In fact, the growth of postgraduate
   degrees, diplomas and certificates in some countries is now higher than
   the growth in undergraduate degrees. Master’s degrees, PhDs and courses
   are available in just about every academic discipline imaginable and
   with thousands of universities around the world to choose from,
   everyone pursuing postgraduate studies can find a school and program
   that is perfect for their needs.

   There are many different types of universities and other higher
   education institutions around the world. Although the details vary by
   country, most fall into one of several categories, such as:
     * General universities that focus on both research and coursework and
       offer a wide variety of academic disciplines;
     * Business schools that focus on MBAs and other business-related
       graduate degrees;
     * Technical institutions that focus on academic disciplines related
       to science, technology, engineering and math;
     * Art institutions that focus on art-related disciplines such as
       sculpture, painting, theater and dance;
     * Education institutions that focus on degrees for professionals who
       teach at the primary and secondary education levels.

   Students who enroll in a master’s degree program from a
   research-oriented university can usually expect to conduct a research
   project or write a thesis in addition to coursework. Master’s programs
   taught by other institutions may also require some sort of project, but
   generally tend to focus more on coursework or practical experience.
   Nearly all PhD programs require original research and a dissertation.

   Potential students may also want to consider studying abroad,
   particularly if they are interested in highly specialized academic
   disciplines such as international business or Middle East studies.
   Students are increasingly studying across borders for all levels of
   tertiary education (college or university-level studies). According to
   the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
   (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics (UIS), the number of students
   studying abroad is approaching 4 million per year, nearly double the 2
   million studying abroad in 2000. Students from East Asia and the
   Pacific make up 28 percent of this total, while students from North
   America and Europe account for about 15 percent. The countries that
   send the most students abroad are China, India and the Republic of
   Korea. About 6 percent of students from Central Asia and about 5
   percent of students from sub-Saharan Africa study abroad, making
   students from those regions the most mobile in the world. The current
   top destinations for international students are the United States, the
   United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Japan.

   Many students are also enrolled in online or distance learning
   graduate-level programs taught in countries other than their country of
   residence. These students are not included in the UIS numbers, so the
   total number of international students is somewhat higher, likely more
   than 4 million.

   Students may want to consider studying abroad for a variety of reasons,
   including:
     * Being able to select from the world’s top programs for a given
       academic discipline. In addition, some academic disciplines are
       only available in a handful of countries, or the best programs are
       available in only certain regions. For example, someone interested
       in Buddhist studies will find the best programs in Thailand.
     * Studying in a different culture. Students pursuing master’s
       degrees, PhDs or courses in regional studies should consider a
       program taught in that region to obtain a full cultural immersion.
       In addition, students planning careers in international business
       will gain invaluable experience from living in another culture.
     * Increased language skills if the program is taught in a different
       language than the student’s native tongue. In addition, although
       many international master’s and PhD programs are now taught in
       English even in non-English speaking countries, students may have
       the opportunity to increase their language skills through extra
       studies or assimilation with the local population.

   Students considering pursuing a postgraduate degree may want to
   consider the following factors when deciding whether to study at a
   university in their home country or abroad:
     * The cost of the program, including living expenses. Some countries
       offer inexpensive or even free tuition, but high living expenses
       may offset those savings. However, many countries and individual
       universities offer scholarships and other types of financial aid,
       and some of these are targeted at international students. Countries
       also vary widely regarding how much international students are
       allowed to work, and some countries do not allow international
       students to work at all. Health insurance costs also vary widely
       from one country to another.
     * The quality of the education gained, relative to the expense and
       intangible factors of studying abroad, such as cultural immersion
       and language skills. Although all accredited master’s programs meet
       a high level of standards, teaching methods vary widely across
       different schools, programs and cultures. In addition, some
       students may find that they learn less when studying in a
       non-native language.
     * Language skills required. Students not proficient in the language
       of instruction for a particular course of study may need to spend
       an additional year or so gaining that proficiency. Sometimes the
       students can gain this proficiency through studies in their native
       country, but in other cases they may need to spend additional time
       abroad.
     * Type of studies offered, such as part-time versus full-time, online
       and distance learning. Most countries require international
       students residing in the country on a student visa to study on a
       full-time basis. However, students already living in another
       country on a work permit may be able to pursue studies on a
       part-time basis. In addition, online and distance learning programs
       offer great flexibility.
     * Impact on family members, for students with families. Family
       members may need language skills as well, and some countries do not
       allow spouses to work even if the student can work.
