   Statement published: 1 August 2019

   The BBC has proposed to change BBC iPlayer from a service where
   programmes are available to ‘catch-up’ for 30 days after broadcast, to
   one where programmes are available for 12 months as standard, with some
   available for longer.

   As required by the BBC Charter and Agreement, we have carried out a
   competition assessment, under which we:
     * looked at the public value provided by the BBC’s proposals;
     * analysed the way in which they impact on competition; and
     * considered whether that public value justifies any adverse impacts
       that we identified.

   This document sets out our analysis and final determination.

   In line with our provisional view, we have concluded that the BBC’s
   proposed changes to BBC iPlayer could deliver significant public value
   over time. They could increase choice and availability of
   public-service broadcast content, and help ensure the BBC remains
   relevant in the face of changing viewing habits.

   However, we remain concerned about the competitive challenges created,
   particularly for other public service broadcasters’ video-on-demand
   services. So, while we have concluded that the public value justifies
   the adverse impact on fair and effective competition we have
   identified, and the BBC can proceed with its plans, this is subject to
   certain conditions and guidance. Our conditions will ensure that the
   new BBC iPlayer delivers future public value, and will mitigate risks
   to fair and effective competition.
