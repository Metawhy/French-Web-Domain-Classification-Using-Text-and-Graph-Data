   (version 2.0 dated 16th April 2018)

   Dear Visitor (hereinafter, "You" or the ‘"User"),

   the company mainADV Srl, having its registered office in Piazza

   registered with the Company Register of Enterprises of Italy under No.
   PE-134286 (hereinafter, "We" or the "Company", or the “Controller”).
   Our Company carries on the activity of digital advertising.
   Considered the above, we are a third party in relation to the website
   where you are coming from (the ”Website of Origin”)
   Since when you visit the Website of Origin we install profile cookies
   on your browser, we hereby aim at explaining to You what cookies are
   and how they are used.
   The Company collects and processes your personal data by means of these
   cookies. With this document (the “Cookie Policy”) hereby explains to
   You how We collect such data, for which purposes and what your rights
   are, also pursuant to Article 13 of the Legislative Decree No. 196 of
   30 June 2003 (the “Privacy Code”) and to Article 13 of the General Data
   Protection Regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”, GDPR
   together with the Privacy Code and any applicable data protection
   regulation: “Privacy Laws”).
   The Controller takes the utmost account of the right to privacy and
   protection of personal data of its Users. For any information related
   to this Cookie Policy, Users may contact the Controller at any time,

   • By sending an e-mail to [email protected]

   A. What cookies are and what they are for

   The cookies are small text files that the websites visited by a user
   send directly to its terminal (usually, to the browser), where they are
   memorised to be transmitted to the same websites at the following visit
   of the same by the same user (the so called proprium first part
   cookies). During the web surfing of a website, a user may receive on
   its terminal also cookies of other websites or of other web servers
   (the so called third parties cookies); this happens because there may
   be elements on the visited website, such as images, maps, sounds, links
   to specific web pages of other domains that are on servers other than
   the server on which the requested page is placed.  In other words, such
   cookies are set up on a website other than the one that is currently
   visited.
   The cookies may have a duration limited to a single session of
   navigation on the browser (the so called session cookies), and, in such
   event, they deactivate automatically once the browser is closed by the
   user; or may have a predetermined duration and, in such event, they
   will remain memorised and active on your hard disk until the expiry
   date, thus continuing collecting information during different sessions
   of navigation on the browser (the so called permanent cookies).
   The cookies are used for several purposes. Certain cookies are
   necessary in order to allow You to surf websites and benefit of their
   functionalities (the so called technical cookies). Other cookies are
   used in order to obtain statistical information, whether in aggregate
   or not, about the number of users accessing the websites and how the
   websites are used (the so called monitoring cookies or analytics). To
   the end, other cookies are used in order to track your consumer profile
   and make You viewing advertisings that may be of interest for You,
   since complying with your preferences and your consumer habits (the so
   called profiling cookies).

   B. Profiling cookies
   The profiling cookies are used to create a user’s profile, based on the
   preferences and likings showed by You during the navigation on Internet
   and to make You display advertisings consistent with your profile. In
   such way, the advertisings that You will display on the Website of
   Origin and the other websites that host our cookies could be more of
   interest for You. Your prior consent s requested in order to install
   such cookies, as provided pursuant the current privacy law.  For such a
   reason, when you access the Website of Origin a specific banner is
   displayed, informing you that (i) profiling cookies are used on the
   Website of origin and that (ii) closing the banner, surfing on the home
   page or clicking whatever element on the home page outside the banner,
   You are giving your consent to the use of cookies. In some cases the
   Website of Origin may ask you to give an explicit consent to the
   storing of these cookies, for example by requesting you to click on a
   specific acceptance button. For further information, please read the
   cookie policy of the Website of Origin.
   In the event that you express your consent to the use of cookies in
   this way, the publisher of the Website of Origin may track your consent
   by means of a specific technical cookie.  In this way, the publisher of
   the Website or Origin will avoid you displaying the cookies banner
   during your following visits of the Website of Origin.  Please take
   into account that, in the event that you remove from your browser such
   technical cookie with the modalities set forth under the following
   paragraph C, No. 1), the track of your consent would be lost and,
   therefore, the cookies banner will be displayed again during your
   following visit to the Website of Origin.
   You are clearly free to block the installation of profiling cookies in
   any moment whatsoever and this will not compromise in any manner
   whatsoever the possibility to visit the Website of Origin and benefit
   of its contents.
   Our profiling cookies are installed directly by the Company.  Such
   cookies are lasting ones and have a maximum duration of 12 months.  The
   first part profiling cookies used are the specified in the following

   For disabling such profiling cookies please amend your browser’s
   settings (please see paragraph C, No. 1) or use the following practical
   interactive button: click here
   Using the interactive button to block our profiling cookies, You will
   receive in any case a technical cookie in order to memorise your
   preference.  Please consider that, removing all the cookies from the
   browser, also this technical cookie could be removed and, therefore,
   you would have to express again your choice to block such cookies using
   the interactive button included in this Cookie Policy.
