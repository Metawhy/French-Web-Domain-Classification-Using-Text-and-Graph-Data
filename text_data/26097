OUR  STORIES

     * Empowering Women: the Most Effective Tool for Development
       Empowering women through financial security sparks change that is
       about so much more than money. It enables women to gain greater
       control over many other aspects of their lives.
     * Support for Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University and Related
       Projects Through several grants since 2004, the Stavros Niarchos
       Foundation (SNF) has supported building projects, equipment
       purchase, and educational programs in northern Thailand, provinces
       of eastern Myanmar, and regions of Lao.
     * The Interactive Constitution: Classroom Edition, a project with
       fans across the political spectrum Can you name the three branches
       of the United States government? If so, you’re in the minority. The
       National Constitution Center wants to change that.
     * Find Yourself Dozing Off during their Concert? They’ll be Thrilled.
       At some point, we’ve all had the experience of listening to a song
       that resonates so deeply it feels it must have been written just
       for us. For kids whose parents take part in Carnegie Hall’s Lullaby
       Project, this may actually be the case.
     * “What do your Roots Sound Like?” Arts on the Move with New York
       City Center It’s tempting to believe disparities in access to arts
       and cultural resources will inevitably be erased by expanding
       digital access.
     * Year One of SNF Support for Special Olympics’ “Play Unified. Learn
       Unified.” In its push for inclusion, Special Olympics, founded in
       1968, draws from a premise much older.
     * Five Υears of Improving Child Health in Burkina Faso Child
       mortality rates in Burkina Faso have been falling for decades, but
       hampering further progress has been a serious shortage of skilled
       nursery staff.
     * A Βig Βirthday, a Return to our Roots, and a Look at Who We Are
       Today marks the 110th anniversary of our founder’s birth. Though
       Stavros Niarchos passed away in 1996, the Foundation bearing his
       name reflects his roots and is guided by his vision.
     * Ten-Week Free Run of Antigone in Ferguson Draws to a Close in
       Brooklyn As exemplified by the company’s name, Theater of War is
       adept at taking words whose meaning we think we know—or had taken
       as granted without thinking much about them—and making us encounter
       their significance anew.

     * Support for Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University and Related
       Projects Through several grants since 2004, the Stavros Niarchos
       Foundation (SNF) has supported building projects, equipment
       purchase, and educational programs in northern Thailand, provinces
       of eastern Myanmar, and regions of Lao.
     * The Interactive Constitution: Classroom Edition, a project with
       fans across the political spectrum Can you name the three branches
       of the United States government? If so, you’re in the minority. The
       National Constitution Center wants to change that.
     * Find Yourself Dozing Off during their Concert? They’ll be Thrilled.
       At some point, we’ve all had the experience of listening to a song
       that resonates so deeply it feels it must have been written just
       for us. For kids whose parents take part in Carnegie Hall’s Lullaby
       Project, this may actually be the case.
     * “What do your Roots Sound Like?” Arts on the Move with New York
       City Center It’s tempting to believe disparities in access to arts
       and cultural resources will inevitably be erased by expanding
       digital access.
     * Year One of SNF Support for Special Olympics’ “Play Unified. Learn
       Unified.” In its push for inclusion, Special Olympics, founded in
       1968, draws from a premise much older.
     * Five Υears of Improving Child Health in Burkina Faso Child
       mortality rates in Burkina Faso have been falling for decades, but
       hampering further progress has been a serious shortage of skilled
       nursery staff.
     * A Βig Βirthday, a Return to our Roots, and a Look at Who We Are
       Today marks the 110th anniversary of our founder’s birth. Though
       Stavros Niarchos passed away in 1996, the Foundation bearing his
       name reflects his roots and is guided by his vision.
     * Ten-Week Free Run of Antigone in Ferguson Draws to a Close in
       Brooklyn As exemplified by the company’s name, Theater of War is
       adept at taking words whose meaning we think we know—or had taken
       as granted without thinking much about them—and making us encounter
       their significance anew.
