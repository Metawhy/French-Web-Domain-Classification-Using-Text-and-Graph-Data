Abstract

   Objective

   Breakfast consumption has been consistently associated with health
   outcomes and cognitive functioning in schoolchildren. Evidence of
   direct links with educational outcomes remains equivocal. We aimed to
   examine the link between breakfast consumption in 9–11-year-old
   children and educational outcomes obtained 6–18 months later.
   Design

   Data on individual-level free school meal entitlement and educational
   outcomes (Statutory Assessment Tests (SATs) at Key Stage 2) were
   obtained via the SAIL databank and linked to earlier data collected on
   breakfast consumption. Multilevel modelling assessed associations
   between breakfast consumption and SATs.
   Setting

   Trial of the Primary School Free Breakfast Initiative in Wales.
   Subjects

   Year 5 and 6 students, n 3093 (baseline) and n 3055 (follow-up).
   Results

   Significant associations were found between all dietary behaviours and
   better performance in SATs, adjusted for gender and individual- and
   school-level free school meal entitlement (OR=1·95; CI 1·58, 2·40 for
   breakfast, OR=1·08; CI 1·04, 1·13 for healthy breakfast items). No
   association was observed between number of unhealthy breakfast items
   consumed and educational performance. Association of breakfast
   consumption with educational performance was stronger where the measure
   of breakfast consumption was more proximal to SATs tests (OR=2·02
   measured 6 months prior to SATs, OR=1·61 measured 18 months prior).
   Conclusions

   Significant positive associations between self-reported breakfast
   consumption and educational outcomes were observed. Future research
   should aim to explore the mechanisms by which breakfast consumption and
   educational outcomes are linked, and understand how to promote
   breakfast consumption among schoolchildren. Communicating findings of
   educational benefits to schools may help to enhance buy-in to efforts
   to improve health behaviours of pupils.

   It has now been four years since the implementation of the Mexican
   sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax at the beginning of 2014 – the first
   substantial, nationwide tax on SSB for health-related reasons. The
   enactment of this SSB tax, its robust evaluation and positive effects
   on reducing SSB purchases set a path for increasing global action in
   the years to follow. The implementation of SSB taxes as part of wider
   efforts to address obesity and diet-related chronic diseases was
   recognized to be at a tipping point in 2016^( ^1 ^). Unlike other
   recommended obesity prevention policies, such as restrictions on
   unhealthy food marketing to children, SSB taxes are fast becoming a
   norm in the USA and elsewhere around the globe, and the scientific
   evidence base is increasing and strengthening. Contradicting the view
   that SSB taxes are a progressive or left-wing preference, a recent
   study found that most SSB taxes are implemented by conservative or
   right-wing governments^( ^2 ^). A recent review^( ^3 ^) on key policy
   lessons from health taxes does, however, highlight the importance of
   being clear about the primary goal of the tax as health taxes remain
   vulnerable to hostile lobbying. Earmarking health taxes for health
   spending was clearly found to increase both public and political
   support for their implementation.

   Here we provide an updated timeline of action (below and Fig. 1) and
   highlight evidence and lessons for the year that was 2017.

   Fig. 1 Timeline of notable international progress of sugar-sweetened
   beverage (SSB) taxation, 2017–18 (VAT, Value Added Tax; ASB,
   artificially sweetened beverage)

Notable action

   Much of the SSB tax action in 2017 was concentrated in the USA, with
   the implementation of SSB taxes in six cities following city council or
   public vote (all approved in 2016 with the exception of Seattle,
   Washington, which was approved in June 2017). In the Middle East the
   highest SSB taxes to date were implemented in Saudi Arabia and United
   Arab Emirates. Other countries and jurisdictions that joined the SSB
   tax crusade included Portugal, Brunei and the Catalonian region of
   Spain. This year also saw Estonia and Thailand pass legislation on SSB
   taxes, with taxation due to be mandated in the coming years. Meanwhile,
   the UK and Ireland are preparing for a 2018 implementation of a
   two-tiered levy on the sugar content in SSB. Below we summarize each of
   these actions. For specific design elements of each tax (magnitude,
   type of tax and targeted products), see Fig. 1.

Actions in the USA

   After defeating a relentless $US 9 million campaign by the American
   Beverage Association opposing the SSB tax proposal in 2016^( ^4 ^),
   Philadelphia adopted the SSB tax legislation in January 2017. The tax
   was introduced with the explicit goal of financing universal
   pre-kindergarten, for which broad support existed, and deliberately not
   framed as a health intervention, to avoid contentious debates about the
   role of government in changing individual behaviour^( ^5 ^). The Mayor
   of Philadelphia announced that as of June 2017, the tax had funded 2000
   pre-school childhood education placements and provided 4500
   neighbourhood public-school students and their families with community
   school supports at nine different schools^( ^6 ^).

   April saw the implementation of an SSB tax in Albany, California^( ^7
   ^). Drinks distributed to small retailers (<$US 100 000 in annual gross
   receipts) are excluded. Revenue will go into a general city fund, with
   an informal advisory committee to make recommendations as to how money
   should be spent. Cook County, Illinois followed in July when the Cook
   County Sweetened Beverage Tax Ordinance^( ^8 ^) came into effect, with
   the primary purpose to raise revenue to alleviate budget deficit. The
   tax was repealed three months later following a veto vote by the Cook
   County Board of Commissioners in response to persistent public pressure
   fuelled by the soda industry, which reportedly channelled millions into
   media, lobbying and political activity to oppose the tax^( ^9 ^).

   In July, Boulder, Colorado effected its SSB tax^( ^10 ^). Revenue has
   been earmarked primarily for supporting health, wellness and chronic
   disease programmes for those identified as most at risk. Revenue will
   also be used to cover the administrative costs of the tax^( ^10 ^).
   Also in July, the city of Oakland, California implemented an SSB tax^(
   ^11 ^). Small business distributors (<$US 100 000 in annual gross
   revenue) are excluded from the tax. Revenue has been allocated to
   general funds with a nine-member Community Advisory Board providing
   recommendations to the city council as to how money could be spent on
   programmes that prevent or reduce the health consequences associated
   with regular SSB consumption. The city of Seattle, Washington passed a
   council vote 7–1 in favour of a Sweetened Beverage Tax in June, to take
   effect in January 2018^( ^12 ^). The tax is reduced (from 1.75 cents to
   1 cent per fluid ounce) for manufacturers with an international gross
   income of more than $US 2 billion but less than $US 5 billion. It has
   been suggested that 20 % of the revenue raised from the tax will be
   directed to one-off city expenditures for 5 years, with the remaining
   revenue to be allocated to a range of public health services, including
   support for public health and healthy food initiatives, programmes to
   address inequalities in health, and general administration costs
   relating to the tax.

   While the US city taxes outlined above were successfully adopted by
   public or council vote (albeit later repealed in Cook County), a
   citizen vote for an SSB tax in Santa Fe, New Mexico (with revenue
   proposed to be earmarked for early childhood programmes) failed, with
   42 % in support of the tax. While it is unclear why the SSB tax bill in
   Santa Fe failed, it has been speculated that the lack of early and
   thoughtful engagement with the public, both in terms of the health
   risks associated with regular SSB consumption and how the revenue from
   that tax may be reinvested, may have influenced the outcome^( ^13 ^).

Actions in other countries

   At the national level, in February, Portugal implemented a two-tier
   Value Added Tax to beverages with added sugar and other sweeteners^(
   ^14 ^). There is an indication that the tax design will be modified in
   the next budget, but exactly why this is the case or what modifications
   will occur is currently unclear.

   In April, in an attempt to align the nation ‘towards a healthier
   society’, Brunei introduced a health-related SSB tax as part of a
   broader tax strategy for the nation^( ^15 ^). This SSB tax came into
   effect in April 2017. There has been no indication as to how revenue
   will be used.

   Approximately a month later, in May, the Catalan regional government in
   Spain implemented a two-tier tax on pre-packaged SSB, enacted
   throughout the whole of Catalonia, regardless of manufacturer origin^(
   ^16 ^). Importantly, the bill stipulates that the taxpayer (i.e. the
   manufacturer) is required to pass the tax on to the end consumer.
   However, it is unclear what mechanisms are in place to enforce this. In
   June the Spanish trade associations and companies united in a request
   to the Spanish Government to reverse the tax through an appeal to the
   constitutional court (which, to date, has not resulted to any
   legislative changes).

   June saw Saudi Arabia implement the largest national SSB tax to date
   (after approval in January 2017) as part of a much broader Value Added
   Tax Framework Agreement to raise general government revenue as income
   from natural resources declines^( ^17 ^). Unusual for a country of very
   few consumption taxes and no income tax, this policy represented the
   largest tax to date (50 % tax on soft drinks and 100 % tax on energy
   drinks). The United Arab Emirates followed suit in October 2017^( ^18
   ^).

   This year Thailand became the first South-East Asian country to
   announce a three-tiered excise tax on SSB. The policy came into action
   in September, beginning with a two-year ‘incentive’ period, where tax
   rates have not, and will not, change, but manufacturers are encouraged
   to reformulate to lower-sugar products. As of September 2019, it is
   expected that the tax rate will increase progressively to achieve the
   targeted tax rate by 2021.

   Meanwhile the UK and Ireland prepare for an April 2018 SSB tax
   implementation. Ireland released details of its SSB tax this year, of
   which the design (in terms of both magnitude and date of
   implementation) closely aligns with that of the UK to retain price
   parity and reduce cross-border trade between the Republic of Ireland
   and Northern Ireland. The intention of targeting sugar in these SSB
   taxes, rather than the beverage itself, is to promote product
   reformulation to lower-sugar beverages. Indeed, in March this year, the
   UK Office for Budget Responsibility released revised SSB tax revenue
   predictions, substantially reducing the expected revenue (a reduction
   of more than £150 million ($US 196 million) in 2021–22), reporting that
   beverage manufacturers have responded to the imminent policy with more
   aggressive reformulation than initially expected^( ^19 ^). The report
   also announced that the original exclusion of small producers and
   importers from the SSB tax would be retracted for importers of major
   brands, regardless of the volume imported (which is expected to
   increase revenue by approximately by £45 million ($US 59 million) in
   2021–22).

Real-world evidence

   Key evidence from real-world SSB taxes released this year were those
   relating to the one-year results from Berkeley, California and the
   two-year results from Mexico. While these studies are both somewhat
   limited in causal inference due to their observational nature, the
   similar evaluation conclusions from two quite different contexts
   largely strengthen the body of evidence of real-world effectiveness.
   Preliminary evaluation of beverage price changes following the
   implementation of an SSB tax in Barbados was also released this year.

Evidence from Mexico

   The two-year evaluation of a peso per litre SSB tax in Mexico was
   published in March 2017^( ^20 ^). Store purchase data for 6645
   households from January 2012 to December 2015 revealed a sustained
   reduction in the purchase of taxed beverages two years post policy
   implementation. While the reduction in SSB purchases increased over
   time in the first 12 months post policy implementation, this reduction
   stabilized in the second 12 months at an average of 9·7 % reduction
   compared with predicted purchases in 2015 (average 5·5 % reduction in
   2014). Similar to the 12-month results, the decline in SSB purchases
   was greatest for the lowest-income households (average 9·0 % reduction
   in 2014 and 14·3 % in 2015 compared with high-income households, where
   there was a 4·4 % reduction in 2014 and a 5·6 % reduction in 2015) and
   was driven predominantly by a reduction in non-carbonated beverage
   purchases. The increased purchase of untaxed beverages was also
   sustained over the two-year post-tax period (2·1 % increase). Another
   study by the same lead author this year examined variation in the
   12-month post-SSB tax results in Mexico according to urban or rural
   location and household composition. This analysis revealed that tax
   pass-through and the reduction in SSB purchases were lesser in rural
   areas of Mexico compared with urban areas^( ^21 ^). Moreover, in
   September, contrary to industry rhetoric, the publication of an
   analysis three years post SSB tax policy implementation in Mexico
   demonstrated no change in employment in the non-alcoholic beverage and
   non-essential energy-dense food manufacturing industries^( ^22 ^).

   2017 also saw the release of industry-funded research evaluating the
   impact of the Mexican SSB tax on SSB sales^( ^23 ^). This research from
   the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon (UANL), which used monthly
   industry time-series data of soft drink purchases between January 2007
   and March 2017, concluded that the tax was associated with a reduced
   per capita consumption of soft drinks of 3·8 %. Variations across
   higher- and lower-income households were not reported. Contrary to the
   beverages industry’s propositions, these results are not in contrast
   with those of Colchero et al.^( ^20 ^), who also estimated a small
   impact of the tax on carbonated beverages; as per the evidence
   described above, reductions in SSB purchases were driven primarily by a
   reduction in non-carbonated SSB.

   Euromonitor International also released an analysis of aggregate SSB
   sales data for Mexico this year^( ^24 ^), reporting a near full
   recovery in national soft drink sales in 2016 (0·2 % growth in soft
   drink sales in 2016) since the implementation of the SSB tax in 2014.
   This is in direct contrast to the findings reported by Colchero et
   al.^( ^20 ^) and may be explained by two key differences. First,
   similar to the Mexican SSB tax evaluation by the UANL, this report
   focuses narrowly on ‘soft drinks’ only, and does not account for
   non-carbonated SSB. Second, Euromonitor data represent national
   aggregate sales and therefore do not take account of population growth
   in Mexico, which has been increasing by 1·2 % per year. In other words,
   even if the per capita consumption of soft drinks remained unchanged
   over the time period, total national soft drinks sales would increase^(
   ^25 ^).

   Interestingly, 2017 also revealed a leak of an internal email exchange
   between Coca-Cola executives^( ^26 ^), highlighting findings from
   industry-funded research. In an email, Kerry Tressler, Director for
   Public Affairs for Coca-Cola, states: ‘Multiple studies from
   well-respected institutions in Mexico (ITAM [Mexico Autonomous
   Institute of Technology], ColMex [The College of Mexico], and UANL,
   supported by funding from industry) make clear the tax was
   ineffective’. These leaked emails revealed that the evidence suggesting
   a return of SSB sales to pre-tax trends, two years post policy
   implementation, was also funded by industry. Similar comments were made
   relating to a study demonstrating an increase in business closures
   following SSB tax implementation, which was done by ‘a key member of
   the coalition’.

Evidence from Berkeley, California

   The 12-month analysis of the Berkeley, California, penny-per-ounce SSB
   excise tax was published in April 2017. An analysis of twenty-six
   different stores revealed complete tax pass-through from retailers to
   consumers in large and small chain supermarkets and gas stations,
   partial-pass through in pharmacies and negative pass-through in
   independent corner stores and independent gas stations^( ^27 ^). An
   analysis of beverage prices from point-of-sale scanner data on 15·5
   million supermarket checkouts (from two large chains) found an average
   tax pass-through of 67 % across all SSB (0.67 cents per ounce), with
   complete pass-through for carbonated beverages and energy drinks. Using
   this same source of data, sales of SSB (in ounces) were estimated to
   decline by 9·6 % compared with projected trends of SSB sales if the tax
   were not implemented. Conversely, sales of SSB in non-Berkeley stores
   located in comparison cities rose by 6·9 %. Sales of untaxed beverages
   rose by 3·5 % in Berkeley compared projected trends compared with 0·5 %
   for non-Berkeley stores. Importantly, consumer spending per transaction
   did not change significantly and store revenue tracked as expected if
   the policy were not in place, representing minimal financial impact to
   consumers and retailers. In addition to the analysis of objective sales
   data, that study also collected self-reported beverage intake data from
   a relatively modest number (and response rate) of adult Berkeley
   residents (n 957; response rate 17·4 %). In the analysis, reductions in
   mean daily SSB intake in grams (–19·8 %) and in mean per capita SSB
   energy intake (–13·3 %) were not statistically significant.

Evidence from Barbados

   Finally, a descriptive analysis of the initial beverage price changes
   following implementation of a 10 % ad valorem SSB tax in September 2015
   in Barbados, revealed an average 5·9 % increase in SSB prices and a
   relatively stable non-SSB price in the two quarters after the tax was
   implemented^( ^28 ^). An ongoing evaluation of the Barbados tax is
   planned to assess longer-term changes in both beverage prices and
   sales.

Looking forward

   Next year is shaping up to be another big year for SSB tax
   implementation. San Francisco’s 1 cent-per-ounce SSB tax is set to take
   effect in January. Estonia is due to follow in January, and the UK and
   Ireland in April. After a deferred implementation date of April 2017
   for the South African SSB tax (following stakeholder submissions to the
   proposed bill which government is now reviewing), it is also expected
   that this tax will be implemented next year in April. Whether this
   comes with amendments to the bill is unclear. In the Philippines the
   president has called for tax on SSB using locally produced sugar with
   revenue to be earmarked for feeding programmes that address
   undernutrition; however, this is yet to pass through government.

   In general, confidence of policy makers in implementing SSB taxes seems
   to be increasing as some countries start implementing much higher
   levies and other countries begin to contemplate taxing junk food more
   broadly, such as Chile^( ^29 ^). Evidence for these broader based taxes
   is also mounting, with the release of the two-year evaluation of the 8
   % tax on non-essential energy-dense foods in Mexico this year^( ^30 ^).
   Using longitudinal data on Mexican household purchases between 2012 and
   2015, that study demonstrated a 7·4 % decline in the purchase of taxed
   items, two years post policy implementation (up from 4·8 % one year
   post policy implementation). Importantly, this effect was greatest
   among households considered to have a greater preference for taxed food
   products (12·3 % decline in non-essential energy-dense foods two years
   post policy implementation).

   Industry will continue to act as a formidable opponent to action, so it
   will be crucial that all polices are embedded in comprehensive and
   robust evaluation frameworks and the results disseminated widely^( ^31
   ^). The message that an SSB tax cannot be viewed as a magic bullet to
   solve the problem of obesity must be actively reiterated and the
   evidence on the impact of other health outcomes, in particular dental
   health, strengthened. Long-term impacts of such taxes on population
   rates of obesity are likely to be small, but should not take away the
   importance of such policies in the pursuit of healthier population
   diets reducing diet-related ill health. 2017 proved to be a significant
   year for international SSB tax action. We expect 2018 to be equally
   momentous.

Abstract

   Taylor Glacier hosts an active englacial hydrologic system that feeds
   Blood Falls, a supraglacial outflow of iron-rich subglacial brine at
   the terminus, despite mean annual air temperatures of −17°C and limited
   surface melt. Taylor Glacier is an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic
   ice sheet that terminates in Lake Bonney, McMurdo Dry Valleys. To image
   and map the brine feeding Blood Falls, we used radio echo sounding to
   delineate a subhorizontal zone of englacial brine upstream from Blood
   Falls and elongated in the ice flow direction. We estimate volumetric
   brine content in excess of 13% within 2 m of the central axis of this
   zone, and likely much higher at its center. Brine content decreases,
   but remains detectable, up to 45 m away along some transects. Hence, we
   infer a network of subparallel basal crevasses allowing injection of
   pressurized subglacial brine into the ice. Subglacial brine is routed
   towards Blood Falls by hydraulic potential gradients associated with
   deeply incised supraglacial valleys. The brine remains liquid within
   the subglacial and englacial environments through latent heat of
   freezing coupled with elevated salt content. Our findings suggest that
   cold glaciers could support freshwater hydrologic systems through
   localized warming by latent heat alone.

Abstract

   Objective

   Breakfast consumption has been consistently associated with health
   outcomes and cognitive functioning in schoolchildren. Evidence of
   direct links with educational outcomes remains equivocal. We aimed to
   examine the link between breakfast consumption in 9–11-year-old
   children and educational outcomes obtained 6–18 months later.
   Design

   Data on individual-level free school meal entitlement and educational
   outcomes (Statutory Assessment Tests (SATs) at Key Stage 2) were
   obtained via the SAIL databank and linked to earlier data collected on
   breakfast consumption. Multilevel modelling assessed associations
   between breakfast consumption and SATs.
   Setting

   Trial of the Primary School Free Breakfast Initiative in Wales.
   Subjects

   Year 5 and 6 students, n 3093 (baseline) and n 3055 (follow-up).
   Results

   Significant associations were found between all dietary behaviours and
   better performance in SATs, adjusted for gender and individual- and
   school-level free school meal entitlement (OR=1·95; CI 1·58, 2·40 for
   breakfast, OR=1·08; CI 1·04, 1·13 for healthy breakfast items). No
   association was observed between number of unhealthy breakfast items
   consumed and educational performance. Association of breakfast
   consumption with educational performance was stronger where the measure
   of breakfast consumption was more proximal to SATs tests (OR=2·02
   measured 6 months prior to SATs, OR=1·61 measured 18 months prior).
   Conclusions

   Significant positive associations between self-reported breakfast
   consumption and educational outcomes were observed. Future research
   should aim to explore the mechanisms by which breakfast consumption and
   educational outcomes are linked, and understand how to promote
   breakfast consumption among schoolchildren. Communicating findings of
   educational benefits to schools may help to enhance buy-in to efforts
   to improve health behaviours of pupils.

   It has now been four years since the implementation of the Mexican
   sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax at the beginning of 2014 – the first
   substantial, nationwide tax on SSB for health-related reasons. The
   enactment of this SSB tax, its robust evaluation and positive effects
   on reducing SSB purchases set a path for increasing global action in
   the years to follow. The implementation of SSB taxes as part of wider
   efforts to address obesity and diet-related chronic diseases was
   recognized to be at a tipping point in 2016^( ^1 ^). Unlike other
   recommended obesity prevention policies, such as restrictions on
   unhealthy food marketing to children, SSB taxes are fast becoming a
   norm in the USA and elsewhere around the globe, and the scientific
   evidence base is increasing and strengthening. Contradicting the view
   that SSB taxes are a progressive or left-wing preference, a recent
   study found that most SSB taxes are implemented by conservative or
   right-wing governments^( ^2 ^). A recent review^( ^3 ^) on key policy
   lessons from health taxes does, however, highlight the importance of
   being clear about the primary goal of the tax as health taxes remain
   vulnerable to hostile lobbying. Earmarking health taxes for health
   spending was clearly found to increase both public and political
   support for their implementation.

   Here we provide an updated timeline of action (below and Fig. 1) and
   highlight evidence and lessons for the year that was 2017.

   Fig. 1 Timeline of notable international progress of sugar-sweetened
   beverage (SSB) taxation, 2017–18 (VAT, Value Added Tax; ASB,
   artificially sweetened beverage)

Notable action

   Much of the SSB tax action in 2017 was concentrated in the USA, with
   the implementation of SSB taxes in six cities following city council or
   public vote (all approved in 2016 with the exception of Seattle,
   Washington, which was approved in June 2017). In the Middle East the
   highest SSB taxes to date were implemented in Saudi Arabia and United
   Arab Emirates. Other countries and jurisdictions that joined the SSB
   tax crusade included Portugal, Brunei and the Catalonian region of
   Spain. This year also saw Estonia and Thailand pass legislation on SSB
   taxes, with taxation due to be mandated in the coming years. Meanwhile,
   the UK and Ireland are preparing for a 2018 implementation of a
   two-tiered levy on the sugar content in SSB. Below we summarize each of
   these actions. For specific design elements of each tax (magnitude,
   type of tax and targeted products), see Fig. 1.

Actions in the USA

   After defeating a relentless $US 9 million campaign by the American
   Beverage Association opposing the SSB tax proposal in 2016^( ^4 ^),
   Philadelphia adopted the SSB tax legislation in January 2017. The tax
   was introduced with the explicit goal of financing universal
   pre-kindergarten, for which broad support existed, and deliberately not
   framed as a health intervention, to avoid contentious debates about the
   role of government in changing individual behaviour^( ^5 ^). The Mayor
   of Philadelphia announced that as of June 2017, the tax had funded 2000
   pre-school childhood education placements and provided 4500
   neighbourhood public-school students and their families with community
   school supports at nine different schools^( ^6 ^).

   April saw the implementation of an SSB tax in Albany, California^( ^7
   ^). Drinks distributed to small retailers (<$US 100 000 in annual gross
   receipts) are excluded. Revenue will go into a general city fund, with
   an informal advisory committee to make recommendations as to how money
   should be spent. Cook County, Illinois followed in July when the Cook
   County Sweetened Beverage Tax Ordinance^( ^8 ^) came into effect, with
   the primary purpose to raise revenue to alleviate budget deficit. The
   tax was repealed three months later following a veto vote by the Cook
   County Board of Commissioners in response to persistent public pressure
   fuelled by the soda industry, which reportedly channelled millions into
   media, lobbying and political activity to oppose the tax^( ^9 ^).

   In July, Boulder, Colorado effected its SSB tax^( ^10 ^). Revenue has
   been earmarked primarily for supporting health, wellness and chronic
   disease programmes for those identified as most at risk. Revenue will
   also be used to cover the administrative costs of the tax^( ^10 ^).
   Also in July, the city of Oakland, California implemented an SSB tax^(
   ^11 ^). Small business distributors (<$US 100 000 in annual gross
   revenue) are excluded from the tax. Revenue has been allocated to
   general funds with a nine-member Community Advisory Board providing
   recommendations to the city council as to how money could be spent on
   programmes that prevent or reduce the health consequences associated
   with regular SSB consumption. The city of Seattle, Washington passed a
   council vote 7–1 in favour of a Sweetened Beverage Tax in June, to take
   effect in January 2018^( ^12 ^). The tax is reduced (from 1.75 cents to
   1 cent per fluid ounce) for manufacturers with an international gross
   income of more than $US 2 billion but less than $US 5 billion. It has
   been suggested that 20 % of the revenue raised from the tax will be
   directed to one-off city expenditures for 5 years, with the remaining
   revenue to be allocated to a range of public health services, including
   support for public health and healthy food initiatives, programmes to
   address inequalities in health, and general administration costs
   relating to the tax.

   While the US city taxes outlined above were successfully adopted by
   public or council vote (albeit later repealed in Cook County), a
   citizen vote for an SSB tax in Santa Fe, New Mexico (with revenue
   proposed to be earmarked for early childhood programmes) failed, with
   42 % in support of the tax. While it is unclear why the SSB tax bill in
   Santa Fe failed, it has been speculated that the lack of early and
   thoughtful engagement with the public, both in terms of the health
   risks associated with regular SSB consumption and how the revenue from
   that tax may be reinvested, may have influenced the outcome^( ^13 ^).

Actions in other countries

   At the national level, in February, Portugal implemented a two-tier
   Value Added Tax to beverages with added sugar and other sweeteners^(
   ^14 ^). There is an indication that the tax design will be modified in
   the next budget, but exactly why this is the case or what modifications
   will occur is currently unclear.

   In April, in an attempt to align the nation ‘towards a healthier
   society’, Brunei introduced a health-related SSB tax as part of a
   broader tax strategy for the nation^( ^15 ^). This SSB tax came into
   effect in April 2017. There has been no indication as to how revenue
   will be used.

   Approximately a month later, in May, the Catalan regional government in
   Spain implemented a two-tier tax on pre-packaged SSB, enacted
   throughout the whole of Catalonia, regardless of manufacturer origin^(
   ^16 ^). Importantly, the bill stipulates that the taxpayer (i.e. the
   manufacturer) is required to pass the tax on to the end consumer.
   However, it is unclear what mechanisms are in place to enforce this. In
   June the Spanish trade associations and companies united in a request
   to the Spanish Government to reverse the tax through an appeal to the
   constitutional court (which, to date, has not resulted to any
   legislative changes).

   June saw Saudi Arabia implement the largest national SSB tax to date
   (after approval in January 2017) as part of a much broader Value Added
   Tax Framework Agreement to raise general government revenue as income
   from natural resources declines^( ^17 ^). Unusual for a country of very
   few consumption taxes and no income tax, this policy represented the
   largest tax to date (50 % tax on soft drinks and 100 % tax on energy
   drinks). The United Arab Emirates followed suit in October 2017^( ^18
   ^).

   This year Thailand became the first South-East Asian country to
   announce a three-tiered excise tax on SSB. The policy came into action
   in September, beginning with a two-year ‘incentive’ period, where tax
   rates have not, and will not, change, but manufacturers are encouraged
   to reformulate to lower-sugar products. As of September 2019, it is
   expected that the tax rate will increase progressively to achieve the
   targeted tax rate by 2021.

   Meanwhile the UK and Ireland prepare for an April 2018 SSB tax
   implementation. Ireland released details of its SSB tax this year, of
   which the design (in terms of both magnitude and date of
   implementation) closely aligns with that of the UK to retain price
   parity and reduce cross-border trade between the Republic of Ireland
   and Northern Ireland. The intention of targeting sugar in these SSB
   taxes, rather than the beverage itself, is to promote product
   reformulation to lower-sugar beverages. Indeed, in March this year, the
   UK Office for Budget Responsibility released revised SSB tax revenue
   predictions, substantially reducing the expected revenue (a reduction
   of more than £150 million ($US 196 million) in 2021–22), reporting that
   beverage manufacturers have responded to the imminent policy with more
   aggressive reformulation than initially expected^( ^19 ^). The report
   also announced that the original exclusion of small producers and
   importers from the SSB tax would be retracted for importers of major
   brands, regardless of the volume imported (which is expected to
   increase revenue by approximately by £45 million ($US 59 million) in
   2021–22).

Real-world evidence

   Key evidence from real-world SSB taxes released this year were those
   relating to the one-year results from Berkeley, California and the
   two-year results from Mexico. While these studies are both somewhat
   limited in causal inference due to their observational nature, the
   similar evaluation conclusions from two quite different contexts
   largely strengthen the body of evidence of real-world effectiveness.
   Preliminary evaluation of beverage price changes following the
   implementation of an SSB tax in Barbados was also released this year.

Evidence from Mexico

   The two-year evaluation of a peso per litre SSB tax in Mexico was
   published in March 2017^( ^20 ^). Store purchase data for 6645
   households from January 2012 to December 2015 revealed a sustained
   reduction in the purchase of taxed beverages two years post policy
   implementation. While the reduction in SSB purchases increased over
   time in the first 12 months post policy implementation, this reduction
   stabilized in the second 12 months at an average of 9·7 % reduction
   compared with predicted purchases in 2015 (average 5·5 % reduction in
   2014). Similar to the 12-month results, the decline in SSB purchases
   was greatest for the lowest-income households (average 9·0 % reduction
   in 2014 and 14·3 % in 2015 compared with high-income households, where
   there was a 4·4 % reduction in 2014 and a 5·6 % reduction in 2015) and
   was driven predominantly by a reduction in non-carbonated beverage
   purchases. The increased purchase of untaxed beverages was also
   sustained over the two-year post-tax period (2·1 % increase). Another
   study by the same lead author this year examined variation in the
   12-month post-SSB tax results in Mexico according to urban or rural
   location and household composition. This analysis revealed that tax
   pass-through and the reduction in SSB purchases were lesser in rural
   areas of Mexico compared with urban areas^( ^21 ^). Moreover, in
   September, contrary to industry rhetoric, the publication of an
   analysis three years post SSB tax policy implementation in Mexico
   demonstrated no change in employment in the non-alcoholic beverage and
   non-essential energy-dense food manufacturing industries^( ^22 ^).

   2017 also saw the release of industry-funded research evaluating the
   impact of the Mexican SSB tax on SSB sales^( ^23 ^). This research from
   the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon (UANL), which used monthly
   industry time-series data of soft drink purchases between January 2007
   and March 2017, concluded that the tax was associated with a reduced
   per capita consumption of soft drinks of 3·8 %. Variations across
   higher- and lower-income households were not reported. Contrary to the
   beverages industry’s propositions, these results are not in contrast
   with those of Colchero et al.^( ^20 ^), who also estimated a small
   impact of the tax on carbonated beverages; as per the evidence
   described above, reductions in SSB purchases were driven primarily by a
   reduction in non-carbonated SSB.

   Euromonitor International also released an analysis of aggregate SSB
   sales data for Mexico this year^( ^24 ^), reporting a near full
   recovery in national soft drink sales in 2016 (0·2 % growth in soft
   drink sales in 2016) since the implementation of the SSB tax in 2014.
   This is in direct contrast to the findings reported by Colchero et
   al.^( ^20 ^) and may be explained by two key differences. First,
   similar to the Mexican SSB tax evaluation by the UANL, this report
   focuses narrowly on ‘soft drinks’ only, and does not account for
   non-carbonated SSB. Second, Euromonitor data represent national
   aggregate sales and therefore do not take account of population growth
   in Mexico, which has been increasing by 1·2 % per year. In other words,
   even if the per capita consumption of soft drinks remained unchanged
   over the time period, total national soft drinks sales would increase^(
   ^25 ^).

   Interestingly, 2017 also revealed a leak of an internal email exchange
   between Coca-Cola executives^( ^26 ^), highlighting findings from
   industry-funded research. In an email, Kerry Tressler, Director for
   Public Affairs for Coca-Cola, states: ‘Multiple studies from
   well-respected institutions in Mexico (ITAM [Mexico Autonomous
   Institute of Technology], ColMex [The College of Mexico], and UANL,
   supported by funding from industry) make clear the tax was
   ineffective’. These leaked emails revealed that the evidence suggesting
   a return of SSB sales to pre-tax trends, two years post policy
   implementation, was also funded by industry. Similar comments were made
   relating to a study demonstrating an increase in business closures
   following SSB tax implementation, which was done by ‘a key member of
   the coalition’.

Evidence from Berkeley, California

   The 12-month analysis of the Berkeley, California, penny-per-ounce SSB
   excise tax was published in April 2017. An analysis of twenty-six
   different stores revealed complete tax pass-through from retailers to
   consumers in large and small chain supermarkets and gas stations,
   partial-pass through in pharmacies and negative pass-through in
   independent corner stores and independent gas stations^( ^27 ^). An
   analysis of beverage prices from point-of-sale scanner data on 15·5
   million supermarket checkouts (from two large chains) found an average
   tax pass-through of 67 % across all SSB (0.67 cents per ounce), with
   complete pass-through for carbonated beverages and energy drinks. Using
   this same source of data, sales of SSB (in ounces) were estimated to
   decline by 9·6 % compared with projected trends of SSB sales if the tax
   were not implemented. Conversely, sales of SSB in non-Berkeley stores
   located in comparison cities rose by 6·9 %. Sales of untaxed beverages
   rose by 3·5 % in Berkeley compared projected trends compared with 0·5 %
   for non-Berkeley stores. Importantly, consumer spending per transaction
   did not change significantly and store revenue tracked as expected if
   the policy were not in place, representing minimal financial impact to
   consumers and retailers. In addition to the analysis of objective sales
   data, that study also collected self-reported beverage intake data from
   a relatively modest number (and response rate) of adult Berkeley
   residents (n 957; response rate 17·4 %). In the analysis, reductions in
   mean daily SSB intake in grams (–19·8 %) and in mean per capita SSB
   energy intake (–13·3 %) were not statistically significant.

Evidence from Barbados

   Finally, a descriptive analysis of the initial beverage price changes
   following implementation of a 10 % ad valorem SSB tax in September 2015
   in Barbados, revealed an average 5·9 % increase in SSB prices and a
   relatively stable non-SSB price in the two quarters after the tax was
   implemented^( ^28 ^). An ongoing evaluation of the Barbados tax is
   planned to assess longer-term changes in both beverage prices and
   sales.

Looking forward

   Next year is shaping up to be another big year for SSB tax
   implementation. San Francisco’s 1 cent-per-ounce SSB tax is set to take
   effect in January. Estonia is due to follow in January, and the UK and
   Ireland in April. After a deferred implementation date of April 2017
   for the South African SSB tax (following stakeholder submissions to the
   proposed bill which government is now reviewing), it is also expected
   that this tax will be implemented next year in April. Whether this
   comes with amendments to the bill is unclear. In the Philippines the
   president has called for tax on SSB using locally produced sugar with
   revenue to be earmarked for feeding programmes that address
   undernutrition; however, this is yet to pass through government.

   In general, confidence of policy makers in implementing SSB taxes seems
   to be increasing as some countries start implementing much higher
   levies and other countries begin to contemplate taxing junk food more
   broadly, such as Chile^( ^29 ^). Evidence for these broader based taxes
   is also mounting, with the release of the two-year evaluation of the 8
   % tax on non-essential energy-dense foods in Mexico this year^( ^30 ^).
   Using longitudinal data on Mexican household purchases between 2012 and
   2015, that study demonstrated a 7·4 % decline in the purchase of taxed
   items, two years post policy implementation (up from 4·8 % one year
   post policy implementation). Importantly, this effect was greatest
   among households considered to have a greater preference for taxed food
   products (12·3 % decline in non-essential energy-dense foods two years
   post policy implementation).

   Industry will continue to act as a formidable opponent to action, so it
   will be crucial that all polices are embedded in comprehensive and
   robust evaluation frameworks and the results disseminated widely^( ^31
   ^). The message that an SSB tax cannot be viewed as a magic bullet to
   solve the problem of obesity must be actively reiterated and the
   evidence on the impact of other health outcomes, in particular dental
   health, strengthened. Long-term impacts of such taxes on population
   rates of obesity are likely to be small, but should not take away the
   importance of such policies in the pursuit of healthier population
   diets reducing diet-related ill health. 2017 proved to be a significant
   year for international SSB tax action. We expect 2018 to be equally
   momentous.

Abstract

   Taylor Glacier hosts an active englacial hydrologic system that feeds
   Blood Falls, a supraglacial outflow of iron-rich subglacial brine at
   the terminus, despite mean annual air temperatures of −17°C and limited
   surface melt. Taylor Glacier is an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic
   ice sheet that terminates in Lake Bonney, McMurdo Dry Valleys. To image
   and map the brine feeding Blood Falls, we used radio echo sounding to
   delineate a subhorizontal zone of englacial brine upstream from Blood
   Falls and elongated in the ice flow direction. We estimate volumetric
   brine content in excess of 13% within 2 m of the central axis of this
   zone, and likely much higher at its center. Brine content decreases,
   but remains detectable, up to 45 m away along some transects. Hence, we
   infer a network of subparallel basal crevasses allowing injection of
   pressurized subglacial brine into the ice. Subglacial brine is routed
   towards Blood Falls by hydraulic potential gradients associated with
   deeply incised supraglacial valleys. The brine remains liquid within
   the subglacial and englacial environments through latent heat of
   freezing coupled with elevated salt content. Our findings suggest that
   cold glaciers could support freshwater hydrologic systems through
   localized warming by latent heat alone.
