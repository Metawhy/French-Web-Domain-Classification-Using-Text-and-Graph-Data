International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia

   1993 ♦ 2017

   The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
   was a United Nations court of law that dealt with war crimes that took
   place during the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. During its
   mandate, which lasted from 1993 - 2017, it irreversibly changed the
   landscape of international humanitarian law, provided victims an
   opportunity to voice the horrors they witnessed and experienced, and
   proved that those suspected of bearing the greatest responsibility for
   atrocities committed during armed conflicts can be called to account.

   This website stands as a monument to those accomplishments, and
   provides access to the wealth of resources that the Tribunal produced
   over the years.
