Bitcoin Expert: Facebook’s GlobalCoin Will Annihilate Ripple

   By CCN: Ripple (XRP) and most other cryptocurrencies should be looking
   over their shoulders now that Facebook has announced it is launching
   GlobalCoin (or Libra), according to Bitcoin expert Max Keiser.

   In Keiser’s opinion, GlobalCoin will render altcoins irrelevant, and
   this includes Ripple. The Bitcoin bull also sees the Facebook coin
   obliterating payments and remittance companies leveraging
   cryptocurrencies:

     “The $FB global stable coin… FaceCoin obviates need for hundreds of
     alt-cons including XRP. The alt-coin apocalypse is nigh.”

How GlobalCoin Will Boost Bitcoin While Slaughtering Ripple

   As has been revealed so far, the purpose of GlobalCoin is making
   peer-to-peer payments and other microtransactions. That could pressure
   altcoins like Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency and Litecoin (LTC), whose
   chief selling points are speedy, cheap transactions. It is also a niche
   that crypto-based payment companies such as BitPay target.

   Unlike what will happen to altcoins, Keiser expects GlobalCoin to be a
   boon for Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin “competes with gold, not
   fiat.”

   Facebook has announced that its digital currency will be pegged to
   multiple currencies and not just the U.S. dollar.

Facebook’s Gameplan

   The social media giant is said to be specifically targeting developing
   countries where domestic currencies experience wild volatility, with
   Venezuela and Zimbabwe immediately coming to mind.

   Besides its main social media platform, the digital currency is
   expected to be available via its other properties. This includes
   WhatsApp and Messenger.

   Already, Facebook Messenger has a peer-to-peer payments function that
   has been a flop, especially in Europe. Mid this month, Facebook is
   expected to discontinue this service in France and the UK.

Why Developing Countries?

   While Facebook is using the argument that GlobalCoin will mostly target
   developing countries with highly volatile national currencies, the
   social media giant could be eyeing more than that. For one, it might
   help Facebook increase its revenues in some of the poorer regions of
   the world where it has a rapidly growing user base but low average
   revenue per user (ARPU).

   As an illustration, the bulk of Facebook’s revenues are drawn from
   North America despite the majority of users hailing from outside this
   region. For instance, in Q4 2018, Facebook generated 34.86 percent of
   its revenues from the U.S. and Canada. In contrast, the Asia Pacific
   region brought in 2.96 percent of the revenues. Yet, just one country
   in the Asia Pacific region, India, has more users than the U.S. and
   Canada combined.

   Additionally, the developing world offers more opportunities for growth
   in payments and remittances as the financial infrastructure is
   relatively underdeveloped.

Facebook Whitepaper Release Will Set Clock Ticking on Ripple’s Demise

   Facebook is expected to launch GlobalCoin sometime next year. The
   social media giant has, however, indicated that the whitepaper for the
   digital currency would be released on June 18.
