BVA Group, which recently joined the ranks of the top 10 Global Market
Research Companies (reaching 150m Euro in 2017), has invested in a 30% share
in BABEL, the French communication agency chaired by Laurent Habib.
     __________________________________________________________________

   BVA’s mission is to facilitate the transformation of their clients by
   leveraging the human factors behind the data: the customer, the citizen
   and the employee. BVA is known as one of the pioneers in applying
   behavioural science (behavioural economics, but also neuroscience and
   UX research) and has won multiple awards within the industry (ESOMAR
   Excellence and best paper awards).

   Beyond its geographical expansion the group has a strategic aim to grow
   its consultancy offering, which has led to many investments and
   transformations in the past few years – including the creation of the
   BVA Nudge Unit, LPI acquisitions (CEO consultancy), Okoni (design
   agency),and BDRC (a UK based global MR group). Indeed, such
   hybridisation between skills allows BVA quickly to transform insight
   into real solutions for customers – using nudge, design, innovation and
   communication – with more integrated and agile answers.

     In order to expand its behaviourally informed consultancy offering,
     the BVA Group has chosen to ally with BABEL, a new French challenger
     with rapid growth in the fields of creation and brand strategy
     consulting.

   Created in 2012 by Laurent Habib, CEO of AAC (a French communication
   agency association) and former CEO of the Havas Group, BABEL is the
   fastest growing French agency, now reaching €19m gross margin with 200
   collaborators. Its mission is to defend strong brands and accompany
   their transformation. BABEL is one of the first communication agencies
   that has been able to advise brands by integrating deep consumer
   insight with an interpretation of the emotional dimension of the
   customer/employee experience.

   “We share with Babel an ambition to reinforce our position in the
   market. In alliance with Babel we can create a high level joint
   offering which best fuses our distinctive approaches to strategic
   branding” said Gerard Lopez, BVA Group chairman. Laurent Habib, BABEL
   Chairman, has confirmed, “Such an alliance will put the deep consumer
   understanding and the human intelligence in the heart of the company
   and brand strategies, to build the unique qualities necessary to their
   survival.”

   This alliance of BVA and BABEL will create a brand new value
   proposition in the market; a consulting approach that is very different
   from those who only rely on technological ‘solutionism’. Indeed, today
   companies realise that their transformation success (or failure) mainly
   relies on the human factor. BVA and BABEL will together bring an
   undeniable expertise in the field of human-sensitive intelligence and
   mastering emotional levers of engagement.

   All branding strategies and marketing plans, whether they are for a
   product, a service, a start-up or an individual, espouse the benefits
   of differentiation in order to capture new customer segments, make them
   stand-out, justify higher prices, leave a lasting impression, etc.



Differentiation: the original linchpin of the brand
     __________________________________________________________________

   The concept of the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) was first proposed
   in the 1940s by the advertising executive Rosser Reeves (“Reality in
   Advertising“). His idea was to associate a tangible and memorable
   benefit to a product to facilitate its sale. For example : Palmolive is
   soft on hands; There’s no clean like Mr. Clean…

   This was followed by brand positioning, popularized by Ries and Trout
   (“Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind“) in the 1980s. They advanced
   the notion of differentiation (“Differentiate Or Die: Survival in our
   Era of Killer Competition“) as a way to stand-out in the mind of the
   consumer by distinguishing the brand from the industry leader: Apple,
   Think Different; Avis, We Try Harder.

   Brands then moved into exploring multiple ways to establish their
   singularity: tone of voice, universes, social causes, emotions
   (“Lovemarks: The Future Beyond Brands“, Kevin Roberts)… All brands
   aiming for the ultimate uniqueness.

   As “Difference” gradually became an absolute, marketing established the
   brand essence, phasing out the competitive landscape. The difference is
   now an intrinsic characteristic of the brand, rather than being what
   sets it apart from others. Brands are claiming to be different without
   identifying “from what”.

   Joy is BMW, Nespresso is George Clooney… The difference locks in the
   identity, the Milka cow being purple, without remembering why (“Purple
   Cow“, Seth Godin). Brands sell their promises and overconfidently
   communicate their promises inside-out. And as the brand offer expands
   the actual differentiation between products is reduced, and its
   credibility erodes.


     Targeting the mind of the customer through communication is no
     longer sufficient, the focus now needs to turn to the product or
     service experience. (BUTTON)   Tweeter




   And so, the MVP (Minimum Value Proposition) has now replaced the USP.
   Designating utility to the product or service, and a quest for usable
   prototypes has become more of a priority than crafting big advertising.
   The resolute focus on the “customer experience” reveals another type of
   difference, one that must be felt, be experienced and, not just be a
   claim.
   [Pomme_BVA_Different_marque_marketing.jpg]

The basics of designing a working difference
     __________________________________________________________________

   To better understand “why” a difference affects consumer behavior, we
   need to stop considering the brand uniquely from the advertiser’s
   point-of-view. Because way before marketing used the brand
   commercially, consumers identified the value of a product or service by
   its mark: brands help them make faster and easier choices.

   A difference can’t just be declared, it exists only if it is perceived
   by the consumer in his environment. And it will not be noticed unless
   it is useful. A difference that has no identifiable advantage lacks
   relevance, and without a specific use, the brand’s raison d’être will
   collapse. As Byron Sharp puts it, (“How Brands Grow: What Marketers
   Don’t Know“), it is more important to be noticed than to be different.

   At BVA, we believe that to renew the usefulness of brands and reinforce
   their singularity in environments undergoing profound change, we need
   to go back to basics and start by understanding how consumers interpret
   this environment. Because, to steer their choices, it is fundamental to
   understand their decision heuristics.

   Furthermore, in order to help brands adopt a client’s point of view
   beyond empathetic encounters, we have chosen to use science: behavioral
   economics, social psychology, neuroscience, ethnography…

   These scientific disciplines are all sources of insight allowing us to
   better understand people and their perception biases and to help reveal
   what actually governs behavior rather than relying on declaratives.

Inspiration comes from the gap between the customer's vision and that of the
brand
     __________________________________________________________________

   In moving the focus away from the brand’s point-of-view to that of the
   customer, one must consider words carefully. The word « difference »,
   for example, can be quite contextual. What it is defining depends on
   who is using it – is it the one perceived by the marketeers or the one
   perceived by the consumer (a notion I developed in “Marque et
   consommateur, le divorce“). In our methods, we explore “customer
   centric” concepts and metrics instead of “brand centric” ones
   (measuring customer experience, performing mix tests in context,
   tracking customer journeys, ethnographic explorations, design thinking,
   Nudge…). This way we avoid the pitfall of favoring ideas that would err
   on the side of “brand intent”.

   Here are some of the concepts at the roots of a brand’s performance:

   Salience: It defines the ability of a product or service to capture the
   attention of the consumer. Salience (not the difference) is a word that
   is defined uniquely from the context and point-of-view of the consumer.
   By decoding the consumers attention filters in situ (web navigation, in
   store journeys…), brands can then identify new ways to emerge using
   minimal effort.

   Memory anchors: Before brands look for a difference, we invite them to
   first identify their similarities: the implicit cues telling consumers
   that these brands belong to the same range of solutions. Because brands
   need anchors to drive spontaneous memory associations that will bring
   -or not- the brand into the future consumer’s repertoire. From there,
   it is the indistinctive experience (with the product/service) that will
   drive memorization, and not just the communication.

   The relative advantage: Our brains are better at evaluating
   propositions in relative terms, than absolute ones, thus it is the «
   relative » advantage that is provided compared with other options that
   counts, more than the actual promise itself. Researching the customer’s
   life helps to reveal the strengths to be played to when comparing with
   alternative uses or market standards, without trying to outbid direct
   competition.

   Thus, the two viewpoints (brand/customer) build on each other more than
   they oppose one another. And this double-entry approach, focused on the
   analysis of the tension between what is communicated (by brand) and
   what is experienced (by customer), render viable the ideas of
   differentiation after users testing a few prototypes in context.
   Because after all, what is important to a business in the long run is
   that the unique customer experience is at the level of the brand “Value
   Proposition”.
