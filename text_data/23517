   “During the past few years, PCF has enjoyed rapid growth, becoming one
   of the leading game development studios in Poland; it’s also at the
   forefront of developing and implementing the Unreal Engine . The
   company is at a very interesting juncture and on the cusp of the global
   release of its new game, „Outriders” with Square Enix,” said Mateusz
   Kirstein. “I’m very happy to be joining People Can Fly at this
   important time and to be able to put my experience to use in supporting
   and growing the studio. It is our goal to strengthen PCF’s position as
   one of the biggest AAA game development studios in Poland and to
   continue to expand and strengthen our position internationally.”

   „I have known Mateusz from the time we both worked at Eurozet and I’m
   excited that we can once again join forces and confront strategic
   challenges faced by People Can Fly,” added Sebastian Wojciechowski. “We

   offers the best working environment and creates the highest quality
   products for players worldwide.”

   „The strength and success of People Can Fly is determined by the
   talented people working in our four studios. We’re interested in the
   expansion of the Rzeszow branch and its integration with the rest of
   the group. This requires strong leadership as Rzeszow has grown into a
   nearly 40-person organization,” explained Wojciechowski.

   „I’ve had strong links to Rzeszow for a number of years now and I’m
   excited to take up this challenge. I would like to fully use the
   potential of the team at PCF Rzeszow, develop its management structures
   and expertise, and strengthen its position inside the PCF group,” said
   Kirstein.

   most creative and deadly kills imaginable.

   Check out the age-gated, action-packed trailer:

   Step into the boots of Grayson Hunt, an exiled member of the elite
   assassin group Dead Echo, after a battle with his former general sends
   them both crash landing on the abandoned resort planet of Stygia.
   Grayson must brave the wasteland on his way to confronting the man that
   once ordered him to do the unthinkable. Will he get his team out alive?
   Or will he finally quench his thirst for revenge?

   Bulletstorm: Duke of Switch Edition also includes Duke Nukem’s
   Bulletstorm Tour. Play through the entire Bulletstorm campaign as Duke
   Nukem, the original FPS action hero, featuring brand-new lines from the

   Bulletstorm story wherever you go. Perform outstanding headshots and
   boots to the head on the run since nothing limits you anymore. Relieve
   the story that brought back FUN to the shooter genre, being unrivaled
   until this very day. Make sure your friends enjoy whichever Skillshot
   you perform and hope they can keep up with your skill.

   They don’t make games like this anymore! But we have the guts to do so!
