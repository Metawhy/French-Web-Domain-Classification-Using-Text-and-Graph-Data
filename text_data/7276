PhD grant in economics
     __________________________________________________________________

   The econometrics of many-to-one matching

   Supervisors:
   Xavier D’Haultfoeuille, Francis Kramarz, Anna Simoni

   Topic:
   many-to-one matching applies to several contexts such as the matching
   between firms and employees, schools and students, patients and
   hospitals etc. Understanding how these matchings take place is crucial
   to develop better assignment tools such as Parcoursup, but also to
   improve public policies aiming at, e.g., enhancing mobility and
   reducing inequality in the labor market. A key question for that is to
   identify, using the observed assignment, the preferences of individuals
   and firms (or schools, hospitals). This task is complicated by (i) the
   fact that revealed preferences may not apply in this context (ii) the
   existence of transferable utilities between workers and firms through
   wages (iii) network externalities: individual preference vary according
   to who else is assigned to their school/firm.
   The aim of this PhD thesis will be to develop identification and
   estimation/inference methods to estimate preferences in this context.
   Once preferences are estimated, welfare analysis or the computation of
   counterfactuals (among others) become possible. The PhD thesis will
   also contain an important empirical part: the new econometric tools
   will be applied to data sources, from France and from Sweden.

   Short bibliography:

       Study on Matching with Network Externalities”, American Economic
       Review, 102(5), 1773-1804.

     * M. Pycia (2012), “Stability and Preference Alignment in Matching
       and Coalition Formation”, Econometrica, 80(1), 323-362.

   Requirements:
   A strong taste and very good skills in microeconomic theory and
   econometrics.

   Selection process:
   Applicants should contact us first (xavier.dhaultfoeuille@ensae.fr,
   francis.kramarz@ensae.fr, anna.simoni@ensae.fr). Then, they will have
   to send applications to Fanda Traoré (Fanda.traore@ensae.fr) and
   present their application during the CREST PhD grant interviews.

Research Assistant Position ‐ CREST – CNRS
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prof. Francis Kramarz, ERC FIRMNET

   Job Details

   Starting date: August/September 2019

   Location: Palaiseau, France

   One‐year (11 to 12 months) fixed term contract, full‐time, gross salary
    of 2.139, 18€/month

   About CREST
   CREST is a joint research center gathering the faculty members of ENSAE
    and Ecole
   Polytechnique, Economics Department. Members conduct research in Econom
   ics, Finance,
   Statistics and Sociology. It is located on the campus of Ecole Polytech
   nique, in Palaiseau, 20km South of Paris.

   Job Description
   The research assistant (RA) will support Professor Francis Kramarz (Dir
   ector of CREST) on the
   FIRMNET project funded by the European Research Council, related to fir
   m networks in a
   globalized environment. The research focuses on how business networks h
   elp firms to be
   resilient in the face of shocks. The RA will mainly work on two compone
   nts:
     * 1)
       The first is concerned with the analysis of European buyer‐seller r
       elations within
       international trade networks, evaluating the transmission of exogen
       ous shocks and
       their effect on workers’ and firms’ outcomes in France over a perio
       d of 15 years. The
       RA will be required to work with large firm‐level datasets provided
        by the French
       administration (DADS, FICUS/FARE, Customs Data), performing a diver
       se set of
       empirical tasks using Stata and SAS. This may include data cleaning
       , running consistency
       checks, merging data sets, preparing data for analysis, programming
        algorithms for identification, running regression analyses etc.
     * 2)
       The second component aims at developing a general equilibrium model
        of international
       trade with heterogeneous firms. The RA will assist in writing a pro
       gram for the
       estimation of structural parameters of the model based on the simul
       ated method of
       moments, using Stata and Matlab. This part of the project is in col
       laboration with
       professors at Pennsylvania State University and Yale University.

   Under the close supervision of the principal investigator, the RA will
   hence conduct different
   research‐related tasks all along the research process, assisting in the
    preparation and revision
   of academic papers being submitted to journals. Since data access is co
   nfidential and therefore
   on‐site, the research assistant is required to come to the institute mo
   st days, although more
   flexible arrangements such as home office and part‐time work can be agr
   eed upon if needed.

   Further, the RA will be fully integrated within the group of PhD studen
   ts at CREST with the
   possibility to participate in weekly research seminars and take classes
    of the PhD program
   (conditional on the approval of his/her supervisor). The position is id
   eal for Master students
   who would like to gather research experience before starting their PhD.
    In particular, previous
   RAs have gone on to pursue their doctoral studies at CREST or within co
   mpetitive PhD programs abroad.
