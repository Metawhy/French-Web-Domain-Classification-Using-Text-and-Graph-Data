   Testimonials

   The Friends are the Cathedral’s fan club. We are admirers of the
   building, its history and its community. We are part of the Cathedral
   and work together to cherish it forever, contributing financially, and
   directly, to many individual and vital projects, and to provide a
   channel for individuals to show their support.

     We thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience of Friends’ Day. Bell
     Harry was extraordinary and was the highlight for us, although the
     walk through the Dean’s garden was exceptional.

     Gen and Lynne Ellis, Norfolk


     The New Members’ Celebration was a really lovely and interesting
     occasion and I was made to feel most welcome and included. The tour
     was very good and there were so many new things to see and learn…
     I’m looking forward to future events.

     Helen Russell, Canterbury


     Such a memorable day… we were fortunate to tour the Deanery which we
     found so interesting. The Dean was such a welcoming host. Lunch was
     delicious and we were able to meet and chat to other Friends in the
     relaxed and comfortable Lodge.

     Anne Richards, Canterbury


     I was very conscious of the words of the very tall steward, when my
     father arranged my enrolment in 1927, who said “If you live to be a
     very old lady you may one day be our oldest Friends!”. I was four
     years old. When I came to Evensong this year I received such a warm
     welcome. I shall often recall moments of the day with great
     pleasure.

     Margaret Hollis, Surrey


     We learned so much on our trip to St Paul’s… and returned to
     Canterbury tired and happy amongst a lovely crowd of Friends.

     Lis Mackintosh-Parr, Dover


     I always enjoy outings with the Friends. The trip to The Savill
     Garden was a really fabulous day.

     Meg Seagrave, Canterbury


     A splendid day at Buckingham Palace.

     Margaret Davis, Canterbury


     We love visiting the Cathedral when we are in Kent. We have been
     friends since 1984.

     Sr and Sra Herodier, El Salvador


     As a Friend I feel connected to the Anglican Tradition that lives
     here at the Cathedral.

     Rev Canon James L Shannon, USA

   Medical Mysteries

   Published on June 3, 2019

   Author: Anna Hegland, PhD candidate at the University of Kent

   Elham 1256, The Mystery of Seals

   From star charts and gemstones to herbal cures for stinking breath,
   this month’s Picture This explores a scientific and medical book whose
   translated title is The Mystery of Seals (Elham 1256). While
   traditional herbals (like John Gerard’s The herball : or generall
   historie of plantes or William Turner’s  A new herball) were popular
   for the botanical knowledge they catalogued, this text focuses on the
   relationships between animal, vegetable, and mineral. Originally
   published in Germany in 1651 by Israel Hibner, a professor of
   mathematics in Erfurt, Germany, the book was translated into English in
   1698 by a ‘Mister B. Clayton’. It is this English translation that has
   made its way into the library at Canterbury Cathedral.

   According to the publisher, W. Downing, this pocket-sized book was
   meant to remind readers of the ‘Vertues [sic] and Influences’ of the
   stars, and ’how readily to apply them to the necessities of Mankind’.
   The nearly 200-page text includes an index of plants, from herbs and
   vegetables to flowers and trees, and a list of precious stones and
   metals which are meant to be combined to help cure various illnesses.

   The detail of the two printed diagrams above is just one example of the
   remedies described in this book. The diagrams depict the two sides of
   the sigil (an inscribed or painted seal) of Mercury, the planet which
   rules the month of June in astrological calendars and star charts, and
   includes the mathematical grid and particular characters (in Hebrew and
   English) that users are instructed to include on their own homemade
   sigils. Beneath these images is a full ‘recipe’ that tells readers how
   to make this sigil, using materials like leather, distilled vinegar,
   and ‘a clean, wooden bowl’.

   The sigil must be stamped before it can be used, but the translator,
   Mr. Clayton, is clear that this can only happen at very specific times.
   Earlier in the book, calendars are provided so that readers can ensure
   their sigils, stones, and remedies will be effective. In June 1698, for
   instance, sigils with the stamp of Mercury could only be finished on
   the 20th and 22nd of the month, at ‘7 minutes past 11 in the morn’ and
   ‘59 minutes past 10 in the morn’, when the planet was in the ascendant.
   Once the sigil has been stamped, we are told it can be carried in a
   ‘purple silk bag, and hang’d about the neck’ and used to preserve from
   and cure all diseases influenced by Mercury.

   How do you know if you’re suffering from an illness governed by
   Mercury? The Mystery of Seals also features a helpful list of ailments
   from which you can diagnose yourself. Mercury’s diseases range from
   minor to serious — from lethargy to memory loss and other brain
   conditions. Sometimes multiple planets can jointly influence the body;
   when Mars and Venus converge (the ruling planets for April and May
   respectively) they can cause blisters, warts, and stinking breath!

   Those suffering from these conditions are advised not to worry, as
   ‘there is no speedier means of curing these maladies than by the herbs,
   roots, and seeds’ gathered while the ruling planet is visible. Each of
   the seven planets recognized in the seventeenth century gets a similar
   section devoted to its herbs, stones, and sigil.

   Although this herbal does not include images of specific plants,
   instead prioritizing the sigil diagrams, the Cathedral collections
   contain a number of other herbals from across the medieval and Early
   Modern periods. These herbals are full of images of English flowers,
   fruit, and trees in mediums ranging from more rough-cut wood block
   stamps to detailed copper engraving plates. All of the greenery listed
   in The Mystery of Seals, including images of apricot trees (Malus
   Armeniaca) and lilies, can be found in herbals like those by John
   Gerard (1545-1612), William Turner (1508-1568), and Pietro Andrea
   Mattioli (1501-1577) (listed in the further reading section below).

   The Mystery of Seals provides a unique insight into some of the
   scientific and medical knowledge that was studied and debated in
   seventeenth century Europe. Its translation into English speaks to the
   popularity of the text, and perhaps its use in the middle- and
   upper-class households who had better access to the range of materials
   it lists. While today’s pharmacists and doctors avoid prescribing
   planetary sigils, the plant-based knowledge found in this book gives a
   glimpse of the home remedies used in and around London and Kent in the
   Early Modern period.

Welcome to Canterbury Cathedral

   Canterbury Cathedral is the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican
   Communion and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Cathedral is
   both a holy place and part of a World Heritage Site. It is the home of
   a community of people who seek to make the Cathedral a place of
   welcome, beauty and holiness. We hope you will be inspired to visit
   Canterbury and the Cathedral and we look forward to welcoming you.

   Please be aware that we are carrying out major restoration work to
   conserve and safeguard our heritage. See our visiting page.
