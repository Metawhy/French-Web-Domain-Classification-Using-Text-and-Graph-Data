         After more than 4 epic years of development, WaterMelon Games is
   proud to present its new 16-Bit game: PAPRIUM (code-name: "ProjectY"),
   a postapocalyptic, outrageous, street brawler. PAPRIUM has been crafted
   at WM's Magical Game Factory using Investor’s votes and suggestions.
   PAPRIUM has been developed by a team driven by true passion and 16-Bit
   excellence.
   Year 8A2, somewhere at equidistant point between Shanghai, Tokyo and
   Pyongyang, a Megapolis rose from ashes of the shortest but most
   devastating nuclear war in history, its name is PAPRIUM. BRUTAL,
   MASSIVE. You will fight your way through the city with Tug, Alex and
   Dice. Redefine the word justice, deal with the BLU drug temptation, and
   more importantly: STAY ALIVE!

   address. Payments are made with PayPal or Credit/Debit card through

   There might be extra little delays but WM never fails to deliver!
   Thanks for your patience and support!

   English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German. In every
   version, the instruction manual is in English with smaller sections
   with Japanese, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish.
   4. Does the game run on any after-market, non-SEGA manufactured
   systems? No, after-market systems do not have the guts to run PAPRIUM,
   stick to the original hardware! No original Mega Drive or SEGA Genesis?
   Click here!
   5. Does the box look like a original MegaDrive/Genesis box? Yes it
   does, it's the exact same style and size. The LIMITED EDITION is made
   of artboard instead of plastic while the CLASSIC EDITION is made of
   plastic!!!
   6. What do you mean by Beat them up? Beat them up (also known as street
   brawler or beat them all) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand
   combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of
   opponents. Gameplay consists of walking through a level, one section at
   a time, defeating a group of enemies before advancing to the next
   section. Find out some of the best known Beat ‘em up : Streets of Rage,
   Final Fight, Double Dragon, Golden Axe, River City Ransom, Turtles
   hyperstone heist, Two crude dudes, Battletoads, Guardian Heroes.
   7. A limited production run, what does it mean? At WaterMelon, we
   always reward the early supporters, the "Limited Edition" is
   manufactured in true limited quantity.
   8. When is the ROM release or STEAM port? PAPRIUM is tailor-made for
   the original Mega Drive / SEGA Genesis hardware and run at an
   uncompromized 60fps, a ROM release or STEAM port can't do it any
   justice.
