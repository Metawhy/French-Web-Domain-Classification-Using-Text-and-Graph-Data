Kilian Jornet: Up and Down Denali in Under 12 Hours

   6/13/14 - The mountain runner Kilian Jornet has set a dramatic new
   speed record for climbing Denali, North Americaʼs highest peak. Jornet
   raced up and down the West Buttressroute, with the Rescue Gully
   variation, in 11 hours 48 minutes. This is nearly five hours quicker
   than the previous fastest known time.

   The West Buttress route starts at Kahiltna base camp at 7,200 feet, the
   landing site for air taxis on the Kahiltna Glacier, and climbs to the
   20,237-foot summit over about 16.5 miles of glacial terrain—or 33 miles
   round-trip. Jornet used skis and crampons for the ascent, and skied
   most or all of the way down. He reached the summit in 9 hours 45
   minutes and descended all the way to base camp in just over two hours.

   Jornet and his teammates (Vivian Bruchez, Seb Montaz, and Jordi Tosas),
   who were there to help him acclimatize safely and to film the speed
   attempt, flew to the mountain in late May. They climbed to the
   14,000-foot camp on the West Buttress route, and spent several days
   exploring the upper mountain, including a trip to the summit. Jornet
   decided to make his attempt by the Rescue Gully, a 40° snow couloir
   that ascends straight from the large basin above the 14,000-foot camp
   to the 17,200-foot high camp below Denali Pass. This route is more
   direct than the usual West Buttress route and more suitable for skiing,
   and as Jornet explained at his website, "We opted for an alternative
   route, a bit more technical, to avoid a stretch with fixed ropes. We
   want to climb mountains in the purest way possible."

   Poor weather plagued the expedition, with only three good  days out of
   the 16 they spent on Denali. So when they got a good forecast for June
   7, Jornet decided to make the attempt then, despite having spent only
   seven days acclimatizing at 14,000 feet or higher. After returning to
   base camp, he set out on June 7 at 7:10 a.m. with the temperature at
   –20°C (–4°F) and wind gusting to 25 mph. He wore insulated ski boots
   and a light ski-racing suit with shell pants and jacket, plus two
   warmer jackets in reserve in a 25-liter pack. He had one liter of water
   and 300cl of  energy gels.

   “I set off well and at a very fast pace as far as 4,000m [around the
   14,000-foot camp]," Jornet said at his blog. "From there up to 5,000m
   [16,400ʼ] there were strong winds and my feet got quite cold. The real
   bad weather started at 5,000m. From there onward to the summit I found
   it hard going, due to both the intense cold and the difference in
   altitude, which was starting to take its toll. I had to stop every so
   often to warm up, and that slowed me down a bit. On reaching the top,
   it took me about 10 minutes to get my skis on and to prepare myself for
   the descent. It was still windy and very cold. From there, I skied
   down, feeling a bit better, but visibility was poor and so I had to be
   careful."

   Once below the steep Rescue Gully, Jornet—a champion ski
   mountaineer—opened the throttle and flew down the lower mountain to
   base camp. "It has been an amazing experience, and two striking
   memories will remain: the moment I reached the summit, not because it
   was beautiful, because there was fog [and] I could not see a thing, but
   because I thought ʼNow my legs will finally stop hurting,ʼ and the
   moment I got to Rescue Gully, where Jordi and Vivian were waiting for
   me [to film] and we shared a few moments together, which were very
   special."

   Speed records on Denali have never been officially timed or tracked,
   but the fastest reported time for the round trip on the West Buttress
   was clocked just last year: 16 hours 46 minutes by Air Force veteran Ed
   Warren from New Hampshire. Warren reported taking 12 hours 29 minutes
   for the ascent. In 2003, the late Chad Kellogg reported an ascent of
   Denali in 14 hours 22 minutes, returning to base camp in less than 24
   hours.

   Jornet earned a 2013 Golden Piton from Climbing for his speed records
   on Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. The Catalan runner now has his eyes
   on Elbrus, Aconcagua, and Everest as part of his multi-year Summits of
   My Life project.
