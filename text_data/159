   So today, I go to a class to learn about the state board of Arizona to
   learn the rules and regulations for AZ nail techinicains. This will
   complete my reciprocity requirements so I can work legally work her in
   Arizona!

   I am looking forward to this because it is different from state to
   state.

   Knowing that I am going to the state board, I thought I should have
   nice nails. So here they are taken with the practice nail I did before
   actually doing them on myself.

   practice nail_edited

   I think I should call them “Smoke and Mirrors” The mirror part from the
   Swarovski crystals of course. Any other suggestions?

   I was just saying to my hubby that I love pure white nails as a base
   for classy nail art except that they look like they need re doing
   almost right away. That is the reasoning behing using Gel Color on top
   of uncured top coat to create a smoke or marble look!.

   I don’t have to fill them as soon as I would normally had to!!!

   I’m sure I will tell you all about my class at AZ State Board after
   today!

   PS. I had to go back and fix my pinkie finger after I saw the dull
   looking finish on it!!!! LOL

What’s your go to?

   I was wondering what your go to nail art is for fast, effective and
   pretty nail art? Like if your client is late but still wants something
   pretty, what do you do?

   Or when you get into a creative slump?

   I found one of the simplest and very effective forms of nail art can be
   done by utilizing gel colors consistency (kind of like oil
   paints…slippery and blend able).

   2017-05-27 18.45.11

   For this look I did a base color coat and cured it (over a cured base
   coat of course), then added the same base color coat with dots of two
   other colors of gel color and used a dotting tool to smoosh them
   together.

   Cure, top coat, your done!

   Drop me a line and let me know what your secret go to is!

   Recently, OPI has launched it’s new ProSpa line. A lovely, skin care
   inspired line to treat your hands and feet to facial quality manicures
   and pedicures.

   prospa

   One of the products caught my eye. Well a couple actually, but today, I
   wanted to tell you about the new thing I learned about ProSina. One of
   the ingredients in the ProSpa Protective Hand, Nail & Cuticle Cream.

   prospa hand

   So, this is what I learned. ProSina is, as described by Croda:

ProSina™

   Technical DataSheet | Supplied by Croda in-cosmetics global 2017

   Hydrolyzed keratin. Is made using a mild proprietary process which
   leaves the natural cystine content of the keratin in an active,
   S-sulpho, form. It is the high proportion of these groups that enables
   it to cross link with the keratin in nails resulting in an increase in
   the integrity and cohesion of the nail plate. Capable of moisturizing
   the skin and strengthening the nails. Used in hand as well as nail
   creams, barrier preparations, foot treatments, creams, lotions-skin
   care, feet, hands, nails and nail color.

   I guess you learn something new every day right!

   Happy long weekend to you all. Be safe!
