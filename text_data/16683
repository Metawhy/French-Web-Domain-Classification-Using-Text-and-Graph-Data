Explorer Tote – Waxer Canvas

     * 21 comments
     * October 1, 2019

   I finally tried out Robert Kaufman’s Waxer Canvas! If you’ve followed
   along here you’ll know I love a good waxed canvas. The Waxer Canvas is
   a bit lighter weight (8.2 oz/yard) than what I’ve usually been using
   (10-12 oz/yard). I honestly wasn’t sure if I was going to like it, but
   the more I used it, the more projects I thought would look great using
   it! I can think of all kinds of projects that aren’t going to need a
   heavier canvas, they might have curves or too many layers for sewing
   with something thicker.

   Interior (optional recessed zipper omitted)

   I sewed up the big size of my Explorer Tote pattern first. I knew it
   was going to look great using all one fabric for the exterior. Clean
   and simple yet still interesting to the eye! I used two layers of the
   Waxer Canvas as the contrast bottom and I think it worked beautifully!
   For the lining I used Big Sur Canvas in Unbleached. I just love how it
   turned out! I didn’t add any interfacing to any of the pieces (total
   time and money saver!). The tote would be great for an overnight bag
   and can still easily pack up if you needed to fold it flat for storage
   or an extra take along bag for traveling.

   To make things easy on myself I used leather for the handles and strap.
   I’ve been thinking about adding a leather kit like this to the shop if
   there might be any interest? Let me know in the comments below! I’ve
   considered attaching the crossbody strap to the swivel hooks just for
   the sake of convenience, that way you wouldn’t have to set any rivets.

   I love how this bag turned out! It’s perfect for fall! Some other ideas
   for projects I would try using the Waxer Canvas would be: Crescent
   Tote, Minimalist Wallet, Fika Tote, Traverse Bag just to name a few!

   Exterior Back view

   Pattern: Explorer Tote (Large size)
   Fabrics: Waxer Canvas (Olive) for exterior, Big Sur Canvas (in
   Unbleached – my fave!) lining (both by Robert Kaufman Fabrics)

   Here are some links to shops that carry Waxer Canvas (includes Etsy and
   Fabric.com). Also, I did some more digging and found more at the
   following shops: Jones & Vandermeer, Bijou Lovely, Three Little Birds,
   Sewtopia., Crimson Tate, Bolt Fabric, Sew to Speak

   If you are a shop owner or if your local shop carries Waxer Canvas
   please let me know! I’d love to add the links to this post. Thank you!

   Leather and turn lock from my shop (let me know if you’d want pre-made
   leather handle/strap kits).

My Studio

     * 37 comments
     * September 24, 2019

   Finally! I know some of you have been waiting for me to post the last
   update on my studio space. I’ve been working in the finished space
   since October of 2018, so almost one year! I keep getting sidetracked
   with projects plus I had a few minor things to finish in the space, so
   it has been getting put on the back burner! I’m so happy to have this
   space for my work. No longer is every crevice in my house filled with
   work things. My daughters can each have a bedroom, and I get a space
   that is separate from my house. Of course there’s both good and not so
   great things about both working at home and having a separate space.
   But I’ve made it a point to have this studio be a happy space where I
   can let my creativity flow.

   So my last post I shared just up until the drywall phase, I know, I’m
   such a tease. But this is the fun part now! I’ll share some pictures
   and then go into a little bit of detail on some of the specific spaces.
   Sound good?

   Here’s the sewing desk and my computer area setup. All desks and parts
   are from Ikea, shelves, too. I’ll write a separate post of the framed
   quilt blocks, so look for that coming up (I’ll share all the details
   including each quilt block, etc.). I made them, and it’s pretty easy!
   So if you’re looking for some fun decor this might be the ticket!

   Up front of the building is a lounge type area. We exposed the brick on
   the one entire wall by taking off all the original plaster. That took
   us dayssss to finish, but I think it really makes the space. So the one
   side has a couch with the brick wall and the other has a white wall
   with a couple of lounge chairs and side table. I’ve been loving using
   this space for taking photos. The light in here is amazing and getting
   a nice photo doesn’t take ripping apart my entire living room any more!

   The center island is one I made after I spotted this one on the Studio
   McGee blog (it’s the first image in the post). I made mine from four
   Ikea dressers put together to form an island. I had a my friend make
   the island work surface of reclaimed wood. We added some different
   drawer pulls to make it less Ikea and more like my inspiration image. I
   use this as my main cutting table. Inside the drawers are interfacing
   and hardware as well as some empty for work in progress stuff! Still
   getting the hang of having extra space. I also have a roll up cart from
   Target that holds a lot of my hardware tools.

   Opposite my desk and across from the cutting table are some Ikea Pax
   closets that hold my fabrics and other random things. For now it’s
   mostly unorganized. I do have my fabric fairly neat in one of the
   cabinets. The rest is a work in progress. Maybe once I get them more
   organized I’ll share some pictures of the insides. Does that sound
   okay? I also need to add some long handle pulls to the doors
   themselves. I also use a NORRÅKER Ikea table for a pressing station. I
   made a topper for it using plywood, a few layers of batting, and some
   linen I had laying around.

   I also have a small kitchenette and dining table and chairs. These have
   both been super handy spaces. The table is from Ikea and the chairs
   from Target. My friend Heidi also made these amazing floating shelves
   from more reclaimed wood and I love them! A couple of lights and a
   plant and I’m all set!

   Exposed the original brick chimney in the back bathroom.

   Hoping to add some wallpaper or color to these bathrooms, but for now
   they work and I’m happy.

   The back area is where I keep my inventory. I have a large work table
   we built from Ikea kitchen base cabinets and some plywood for a top and
   beadboard (from Home Depot) to finish the back. I had to have two
   bathrooms to be up to code, so I have a summer and winter bathroom!
   Just kidding really, but it has been nice the few times I’ve had larger
   gatherings here. I recently added a shaker style peg rail that exists
   between the two bathroom doors which is also handy for photos! Last,
   there’s the mechanical room full of the boring stuff, at least it’s
   clean.

   Closeup of interior windows.

   That’s about it! I tried to link things within each area. If you have
   questions please ask in the comments and I’ll do my best to answer them
   there!

   Oh and here are a few shots of the finished rear exterior of the
   building. I can’t even explain how much was done to this wall to make
   it like this! It was a completely new wall that we built because the
   original had collapsed. I also spent so much time chipping the old
   crumbling plaster off that brick wall! eeek!

   Thanks for your endless support and encouragement throughout this
   process. Here’s a couple of posts if you want to read more about the
   construction: Studio Update, Studio Update (2), Studio Update
   Drywall. We purchased the building in December of 2017 and spent from
   then until October 2018 completing the project.

Chambray Spring Shorts

     * 3 comments
     * September 9, 2019

   Chambray Spring Shorts - Noodlehead This is almost the last of the
   summer garment sewing I’ve done. It filled a nice gap in my summer
   outfits and I’m very happy with how they look and feel! These are my
   second pair of Spring Shorts (pattern is free by Pattern Runway for
   Peppermint Magazine).

   Chambray Spring Shorts - Noodlehead

   I made one small modification to suit my own personal preference and
   also make them slightly different than the first pair I had made from
   linen. The paper bag waist style of the first pair was/is fun, but for
   these I adjusted the waistband piece to accommodate only one piece of
   the 1″-wide elastic without doing the paper bag style. It worked out
   pretty well I think, and I’m glad to have it be slightly different from
   the first. It’s also a little bit nicer to have less bulk at the
   waistband for when I wear shirts that are longer. Chambray Spring
   Shorts - Noodlehead

   It was fun to pair the shorts with my Shirt No. 1 (pattern by 100 Acts
   of Sewing) that I made a few years ago. You can read the full post on
   that here. I love being able to pair two handmade things together for a
   fun summer outfit! I’m usually a jean short wearer in the super hot
   part of summer, but these chambray shorts felt so great on the hot
   humid days.

   Chambray Spring Shorts - Noodlehead

   I bought the khaki colored twill tape at my local Joanns and the wooden
   beads were in my stash of craft supplies (probably got them at Michaels
   many years ago). I love that little extra bit of detail to an otherwise
   simple silhouette.

   What did you make and wear this summer? Or for my Southern Hemisphere
   friends, do you have plans for making these shorts this summer?

   Pattern: Spring Shorts by Pattern Runway for Peppermint Magazine
   Fabric: Chambray Union Light in Indigo from Robert Kaufman from my
   stash, it’s a few years old but I believe you can still purchase it
   (here’s a quick google search)

Cottesloe Swim Suit

     * 7 comments
     * August 29, 2019

   Cottesloe Swim Suit - View D by Megan Nielsen Patterns (sewn by Anna
   Graham - Noodlehead) Cottesloe Swim Suit - View D by Megan Nielsen
   Patterns (sewn by Anna Graham - Noodlehead) I can fully admit that I
   never ever thought I would sew a swim suit for myself. Not because I
   don’t like to swim or because of being self-conscious, but because I
   was a competitive swimmer and I couldn’t imagine myself making
   something that would be quality enough to actually swim in. I grew up
   in a swim suit. I spent hours every day swimming and every weekend at a
   swim meet through college. But when the Megan Nielsen suit (Cottesloe)
   kept showing up in my Instagram feed I couldn’t help but be curious. I
   loved every version I saw. And then mid summer when we finally booked
   our beach vacation I knew I had to make it happen. I loved the idea of
   being able to control how it fit. Making it just right so I felt
   covered enough was a big thing. I feel like there are tons of
   store-bought bikinis available that are just not quite modest enough
   for something I’d want to wear in public. Plus I almost always wear a
   one piece, body surfing anyone?! I love being active in the water, so a
   bikini wasn’t something I had much experience with. Cottesloe Swim Suit

   My supplies came in and I got to work. It was definitely not as hard as
   I thought it would be. The construction itself was quite
   straightforward. Megan has a full sew-along on her blog as well, which
   is what I referenced while attaching the elastic. So if you’ve sewn a
   t-shirt I definitely think that you’d do great making this suit!

   I loved wearing this on the beach. I was comfy and I felt good wearing
   it. Plus it was kind of fun knowing I made it! I did manage to do some
   body surfing in it. The straps came down a few times, but the waves
   were pretty strong, but other than that it was perfect for swimming in!
   I love how the straps are wide and the back is open feeling. I’m used
   to a different style back, but I found this one to be soooo
   comfortable. I was surprised!

   The only change I made was to use View D but lower the waistline down
   on the bottoms. I just moved the waistline down by 2″.

   I’ve got a couple more cuts of swim suit fabric that I ordered from
   Spoonflower (Sport Lycra basecloth). My kids are even asking me to make
   them a suit, so maybe I’ll sneak in making another before summer is
   officially over here!

Ashton Tops

     * 5 comments
     * August 9, 2019

   I’ve been making a few summer wardrobe staples these last few weeks. I
   did finish my pair of chambray Spring Shorts after writing this post.
   Although I actually haven’t worn them yet. Go figure. I’ll save those
   for another post.

   I was very excited to see Helen’s Closet’s newest pattern, the Ashton
   Top pop up in June. It seemed like such a versatile tank! I really like
   that it has both bias tape finishing and a facing option. I really
   wanted to give the facing a try to see if I could get over my hang up
   with facings. I just have memories of them popping out of the neckline
   as a child.

   So for my first go I grabbed this triangle pink chambray that I had
   bought from Drygoods Design a few years ago. It was too pretty to sit
   around any longer so I washed it and cut out the Ashton! I think I got
   ahead of myself in the instructions, so I ended up doing a bias tape
   finish even though I had intended to do facings. Ah well. Ended up that
   after finishing I decided that I needed a few fit adjustments. I knew
   from past experiences that I’ve always wanted to try a broad back
   adjustment. So I gave that a try after following along with this video
   (and obsessively checking a few others). I did a quick muslin after
   making the broad back adjustment to the pattern pieces. I also moved
   the lower part of the armhole slightly lower and dropped the neckline a
   small amount (maybe 3/8″).

   The second tank turned out really well. I remembered to do the facings
   (ha!) and I really love how it came together. It seems like the fit
   adjustments were pretty good I think. This tank is comfy and I feel
   comfortable in it. The triangle version is a bit snug across my
   shoulder blades, but I think I’ll still wear it, that print is too
   good! I’m really glad I gave the Ashton a try and super excited about
   the broad back adjustment working! yay!

   Pattern: Ashton Top by Helen’s Closet (she’s doing a whole month of
   hacks this month, Ashton August!)
   Fabric: Chambray with Triangles from Drygoods Design (this print is
   long gone, but she has an amazing selection of garment fabrics) and
   Liberty of London I’m pretty sure I bought years ago from Jones &
   Vandermeer.

Stamped Wool + Wax Tote and pouch

     * 6 comments
     * July 29, 2019

   Ooookay, so this is a testament to how long I can hold on to my
   favorite fabrics. Does that happen to you? I love hanging on to a
   favorite and waiting for when inspiration strikes and the fabric gets
   used. This is what happened with this fabric! I remember I bought it
   thinking I would make shorts with it??? Not sure how that would have
   turned out, eeeek!, but I’m glad I waited! This is the Cheater Print (a
   cheater print is a single fabric designed to look like patchwork) from
   Ellen Luckett Baker‘s first(?) collection with Kokka from 2012, called
   Stamped. I, of course, had bought and used a lot of the designs from
   that collection: Scallops, triangles, circle flowers and now this
   cheater print. Yep, guess I liked it!

   Handmade Style – Scallop print || Gingham Tote with rounded pocket

   Stamped Wool + Wax Tote and pouch - Noodlehead

   So I was digging through my fabric trying to get it a bit more
   organized (and cleaning out a bit for my annual sewing retreat with my
   friends) and came across this beauty and knew that I had to put it to
   use. Summer time sewing is a bit more limited and so a project like
   this Wool + Wax Tote is quite rewarding to make. With the scraps I made
   a coordinating zippered pouch which is always fun. I think I might be
   satisfied only making these totes with pouches for the rest of my
   sewing life. hahaha.

   I used my Natural leather handles and attached them with rivets. If
   you’re curious about rivets I have a post here that explains a bit more
   and has links to sources. The contrast bottom is a waxed denim from AL
   Frances Textiles on Etsy. To keep things really simple I used Big Sur
   Canvas in Natural for the lining. For me I think I could use this for
   lining every bag. No need to add extra interfacing which is always a
   plus. And it coordinates so well with so many fabrics (plus it comes in
   a ton of other colors, too).

Driftless Fabric Collection

     * 11 comments
     * July 15, 2019

   Driftless Fabric Collection by Anna Graham for Robert Kaufman Fabrics,
   shipping to stores December 2019!!!

   How’s your summer going so far? I feel like I need to acknowledge that
   it’s passing very quickly, but my family and I have been having fun and
   jumping at pretty much every fun opportunity that comes our way. We
   even have a real vacation planned to Chincoteague later this summer.
   Looking forward to some time at the ocean, it’s been too long! I
   haven’t mentioned it here on the blog yet, but on my Instagram you may
   have seen that my next fabric collection, Driftless, with Robert
   Kaufman Fabrics was just released (that means that shops are now seeing
   it and are able to order). I’m so honored to have been able to work
   with Robert Kaufman Fabrics once again.

   Driftless fabric collection by Anna Graham for Robert Kaufman Fabrics

   Driftless is a collection of 26 prints overprinted on Essex and Essex
   Yarn Dye, and Essex Yarn Dye Homespun (yesssss! eeek!) all printed in
   the USA. I’m so thrilled with how the fabric turned out. Don’t you love
   a good fat quarter stack like this? Here’s the super important part –
   it’ll be shipping to stores in December! Yep, I fully know it’s a ways
   away, but I think it’ll be worth the wait for you! If you’re interested
   in these fabrics, please share this with your local quilt shop and ask
   if they’ve ordered. That way they can be sure to get some! I hope this
   small peek of the collection will provide a little bit of inspiration
   and get you excited about sewing with it.

   Annnnnd, I’m bursting at the seams excited to show you the projects I
   made using it! Also, I can hardly wait to talk to you about things that
   inspired me while designing the prints. Here’s a little hint. I’ll be
   saving the projects to share for when it gets closer to the release
   date (so maybe sometime starting in November?!) as I know it can be so
   hard to be inspired to make something yet not have the fabric
   available. So please hang in there!

   Thanks so much for your constant support and encouragement over the
   years! This is truly a dream come true! I’m so excited for Driftless!

Spring Shorts in Linen

     * 6 comments
     * July 1, 2019

   Spring Shorts in Linen - Noodlehead Spring Shorts in Linen - Noodlehead
   I really don’t love wearing shorts. Maybe it’s a comfort thing, maybe
   it’s a not wanting to feel too exposed kind of thing. Either way, I
   went on a spree of trying on shorts at various stores. It’s too hot and
   humid to wear pants, and a dress or skirt isn’t something I want to
   live in all summer. So I made shorts! They fit way better than any
   store-bought option and the fabric and finishes are much higher
   quality. Thank you sewing!

   I’m always happy to make something instead of buying it at the store.
   It actually feels like a fault half of the time because I see something
   and tell myself “oh, you can just make that.” and then never actually
   make it. My closet looks pretty sparse lately and I’m ready to commit a
   little bit more time sewing a few things that I know I’ll wear. It’s
   hard to squeeze the time in, but it really is something I enjoy and I
   love sharing about what I make, even if it isn’t something from one of
   my own patterns. I hope you might find some of the stuff I write about
   helpful.

   Spring Shorts in Linen - Noodlehead

   I had been seeing a few friends make the Spring Shorts pattern from
   Peppermint Magazine (pattern created by Pattern Runway for the
   magazine). They happen to be a free pattern, which is never a deciding
   factor for me. However, I thought it would be helpful to let you know
   that it appears to be somewhat limited sizing, which I’m guessing is
   part of the reason that they can offer it for free. I chose a size 10
   and I think the fit is excellent. I did french seams for the side and
   crotch seams. I didn’t feel like changing my serger thread, so there
   you go! I think they’ll also be quite durable, too. I used some twill
   tape and a couple wood beads from my little pile of trinkets, and I
   really love how they came together.

   The fabric is a linen from Indiesew last summer. I love it but at first
   had the hardest time deciding what project to use it for. At one point
   it ended up being, gasp, a table cloth! Which was perfect for the time
   (I didn’t even hem anything), but also was perfect from when I found it
   the other day and figured I’d give it a shot with these shorts! I think
   it’s the perfect shorts fabric for this humid summer.

   I’ve already cut out a second pair (from chambray) that I’m equally as
   excited about. So hopefully those will get sewn up even quicker now
   that I’m familiar with the pattern, maybe I’ll add some patch pockets
   on the back!

   options in her shop) also, Harts Fabric has a bunch of nice options

Linen Gemma Tank

     * 2 comments
     * June 20, 2019

   Linen Gemma Tank - Noodlehead So I snapped up Wiksten‘s linen earlier
   this Spring and totally blew the fact that I didn’t get enough for the
   first project I had in mind (the Wiksten Shift Dress/Top). I wasn’t too
   mad though, because I knew I could figure out something else to make
   instead. It’s such a beautiful color and nice drape for a summer
   garment so you can’t really go wrong. About a month ago, I had been
   seeing a few warmer climate sewists already sewing up tanks, which
   really gets the creative juices flowing when we’re still a bit cooler
   for a few more weeks. Surprisingly I felt the urge to jump in and get
   started even with other projects looming!

   I always love Rae’s patterns, and the Gemma Tank had been high on my
   list for quite some time. It ended up being the perfect amount for a
   Gemma so I got to work! I love that this project takes hardly any time
   at all. Yet it still produces a beautiful tank that’ll be perfect for
   summer (and hopefully help get rid of my farmer’s tan a bit). I’m also
   really excited about keeping it around for fall and winter to layer
   under some cardigans (maybe I’ll even make one!). An added bonus is if
   you’re a Creativebug member, this tank is one of the classes you can
   take, taught by Rae herself! I love that. I’ve had a membership for
   maybe three years now and it’s such a great way to try something new or
   break out of a rut!

   I started out without any changes to the pattern. I was really cruising
   along and finished, but then decided to wanted to take in the side
   seams a bit and then shorten it a smidge because I don’t think I’ll be
   tucking it in at all. I think the changes ended up being just right and
   am really happy with it.
