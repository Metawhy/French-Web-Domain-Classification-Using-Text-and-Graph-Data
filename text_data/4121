   Research Lighting FAQ

   Ever notice how people texting at night have that eerie blue glow?

   Or wake up ready to write down the Next Great Idea, and get blinded by
   your computer screen?

   During the day, computer screens look good—they're designed to look
   like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be
   looking at the sun.

f.lux

   f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt
   to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.

   It's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your
   computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you
   could just use it just because it makes your computer look better.

   f.lux makes your computer screen look like the room you're in, all the
   time. When the sun sets, it makes your computer look like your indoor
   lights. In the morning, it makes things look like sunlight again.

   Tell f.lux what kind of lighting you have, and where you live. Then
   forget about it. f.lux will do the rest, automatically.

       We say "flux."

f.lux on macOS

     * I have a newer 2013+ Intel GPU on the Mac, and fullscreen video has
       blue artifacts. What should I do?
       This is a video driver bug and not something we can fix directly.
       For Chrome, one of our amazing users has made an extension that
       fixes the issue: VideoFixer for f.lux
     * I have a newer 2017+ Macbook Pro running High Sierra (10.13), and
       sometimes white colors turn cyan.
       This fix from Apple is only in Mojave, so you'll want to upgrade to
       10.14.
     * On El Capitan, sometimes my screen is tinted during the day, even
       after quitting f.lux. How do I fix this?
       This is no longer happening for most people as of the 37.7 update.
       In most other cases, the fix is to disable automatic brightness AND
       reboot. Look at System Preferences > Displays > Color.
     * How do I turn off the "waking up" notifications?
       If they are happening at the wrong time, make sure your wake time
       is set to the right number in "Preferences". If that's no good
       either, use the Options menu to turn off "Backwards Alarm Clock".
     * f.lux on 10.12.4 with Darkroom mode has really bad-looking text
       To fix, look in System Preferences > General and uncheck "Use LCD
       font smoothing when available"
     * With f.lux on Mac OS El Capitan (10.11), the display is flickering
       rapidly when the light changes
       This is fixed in the later versions of El Capitan. In older ones,
       El Capitan has a new automatic brightness feature that conflicts
       with f.lux on some models. You will need to disable "Automatically
       adjust brightness" in System Preferences, Displays. Some people may
       have to reboot after this.

f.lux at work

     * Can I use the free version of f.lux on my work computer?
       Yes, with the knowledge and permission of your employer. Our EULA
       allows users to download and use the software on work machines. Our
       license is with you, the end user, and not with the company. If you
       have rights to install it yourself, and your employer approves, we
       allow it under our personal license.
     * When should a company obtain a paid license for f.lux?
          + For any "site license" situation (centrally managing installs
            for many machines)
          + When an IT department wishes to have control of automatic
            updates and default settings
          + Whenever a company recommends f.lux to employees (corporate
            wellness)
          + If a company has regulatory requirements (like banks do)
       In these cases, you should obtain a corporate license here.
       Currently this build is only available for Windows, and it is
       covered by a separate Corporate EULA.

f.lux on Windows

     * How do I find or change settings?
       Settings are located in a menu to the left of your system clock. In
       Windows, this is at the bottom right corner of your screen. On a
       Mac, it's at the upper right. NOTE: f.lux does not appear in your
       dock, settings, or your alt-tab menu. Currently settings are only
       acessible through the taskbar.
     * Where is "Safe Mode" in f.lux v4?
       We built it in! The new build has massively less impact on games
       and the overall system. If you are a gamer and want less impact
       while playing games, you can also try Options -> Very Fast
       transitions.
     * The Windows f.lux UI now shows everytime I reboot. How do I make it
       hide again?
       We made f.lux do this when you haven't set your location yet. Our
       automatic setting is pretty bad (especially if you don't live in
       the USA.) Click on the location button and set things up, and f.lux
       will auto-hide again.
     * How do I use the new warmer colors and "Darkroom" mode on Windows?
       These features require a small change to your system and a reboot.
       You can look in the "Lighting at Night" menu and choose "Expand
       Color Range". f.lux will ask for Administrator access and offer to
       reboot your PC Now or Later. After your next reboot, you will be
       able to access more dramatic color changes.
     * The colors on Windows changed since the f.lux update. How do I go
       back?
       f.lux v3 started reading your system profile and installing it. If
       you don't like your profile, you can change it in from the Windows
       Control Panel -> Color Management. We recommend finding a profile
       that displays accurate colors (or one you like).
       f.lux v4 also tries to read properties of your monitor. If you want
       to try turning that off, look for "Use display data for better
       color accuracy" in the Options menu.
     * My cursor is bright white on Windows. How do I fix it?
       This happens when your videocard displays uses a "hardware cursor".
       In f.lux v4, you can look in the "Options" menu and turn on
       "Software mouse cursor when needed". In the older version, enabling
       Mouse Trails can help: See this post on StackExchange for more
       info.
     * How do I dim my desktop monitor?
       In Windows f.lux, use the hotkeys Alt-PgDn and Alt-PgUp. (But if
       you're on a laptop, you should mostly dim your backlight to keep
       contrast.)
     * How do I disable the Windows f.lux hotkeys?
       Find the Options menu, and turn them off there.
     * I changed my system profile on Windows and f.lux is using the old
       one
       Yes you should restart f.lux, or wait 10 minutes for us to read it
       again.
     * On Windows XP, the f.lux location dialog does not work. What should
       I do?
       Due to the "Poodle" bug in SSLv3, our server does not allow
       connections from IE on Windows XP. If you use Chrome or another
       browser, you can use this map page and paste your location into
       f.lux instead.

General questions

     * f.lux is not showing my location very accurately. How do I fix
       this?
       This is by design, and it's to help protect your privacy. We round
       your location to 0.1 degree. This lets f.lux estimate your sunset
       timing within about 30 seconds, which is all we need.
     * f.lux is transitioning a few hours early (or late) and I've set my
       location properly. What do I do?
       Check if your clock is correct using our tool here (it should be
       within 10 seconds usually). This problem usually means your
       timezone is set to the wrong one. Double-check by clicking on your
       system clock. When this happens, usually the local time is set so
       it looks right, but because it's in the wrong timezone, your
       computer reports that it's several hours ahead or behind where it
       actually is.
     * I installed this but it looks too pink/orange.
       On first use, it can take a while to adjust to the halogen
       settings. Try adjusting the color temperature sliders under
       Settings until you find one you like. Start with fluorescent or
       halogen and change it when your eyes adjust. When you disable
       f.lux, your screen will return to your normal calibration. We're
       used to looking at very blue computer screens, so it can seem
       unnatural at first. Most LCD displays are calibrated to display at
       6500K, which has even more blue than noon sunlight (5500K).
     * One of my monitors is flickering - it shows white and then orange
       quite frequently. What should I do?
       (This answer is PC and Mac when used with non-Apple monitors) Look
       in the On-Screen Display (OSD) and see if you can turn off DDC/CI
       (the monitor configuration protocol). Some older monitors did not
       handle color changes well and would reset to white before accepting
       new settings. This is fine if you change settings once a month, but
       not so good if you do it more often like f.lux does.
     * When I scroll text with f.lux on, I see a brief red afterimage.
       Why?
       LCDs are faster at doing "gray to gray" color changes than "black
       to white", and if you imagine how f.lux is changing your blue
       channel, the transitions that used to be black-to-white are now
       black-to-gray.
       But what's making this worse these days is a number of GPUs and
       displays are using a technology called Response-Time-Compensation
       or "Overdrive" to improve the speed of these gray transitions even
       more (without improving the speed for black to white much at all).
       Now, the red channel is noticeably "slower" than the blue (because
       f.lux has made the blue channel faster). So as you scroll black
       text, you might see some red afterimages on these displays or GPUs.
       Our recommendation: turn off overdrive (or reduce the amount of it)
       using your driver or on-screen-display.
     * What is the right color setting for me?
       You're at the right color when your monitor screen color looks like
       the pages of a book under your room lights. We're all used to
       monitors giving off a 6500K glow, which is even bluer than
       sunlight. If the default settings of f.lux feel too extreme to you,
       try setting it to fluorescent, and once your eyes adjust, set it to
       a warmer temperature. Some studies indicate blue light is
       beneficial during the day, but late at night it can negatively
       affect your sleep pattern. Our unofficial study indicates that
       f.lux makes your computer look nicer in a dark room.
     * This changes too fast, it always shocks me.
       The f.lux transition can be CPU intensive, so f.lux tries to be
       polite about it. To make it slow, you can use the special 1-hour
       slow transition option under settings instead.
     * I work nights. How should I use f.lux?
       Our best advice is to set your wake time a few hours early.
     * How long is Movie Mode and what does it do?
       It's 2½ hours. We designed Movie Mode to preserve sky colors and
       shadow detail, while still providing a warmer color tone. It's not
       perfect on either count, but it strikes a balance.
     * What are the presets in Kelvin?
       Ember: 1200K
       Candle: 1900K
       Warm Incandescent: 2300K
       Incandescent: 2700K
       Halogen: 3400K
       Fluorescent: 4200K
       Sunlight: 5500K

     * How do I download the old version?
       Try flux-setup3.exe. We do not recommend using v3, as it has
       signficantly more performance impact on the system. Most people can
       find find advice here that will make v4 better for their needs.

Troubleshooting: Flickering and Tinted screens

     * f.lux doesn't work on Windows 10. Help?
       Immediately after upgrading to Windows 10, many machines are using
       a basic video driver that does not work with f.lux. Windows Update
       will usually get a better driver (within a day) to a version that
       works with f.lux. In some cases this does work on its own, so we
       recommend that you update your drivers with the manufacturer's
       latest version.
     * I installed f.lux but I can't see any change.
       Is it past your local sunset time? Just wait, and f.lux will kick
       in at sunset.
       Is your location set correctly under Settings?
       Check that your night-time settings are not set to Daylight.
     * I uninstalled f.lux and my computer is still orange, what gives?
       Some users have encountered a problem where f.lux is no longer
       running but the screen still appears tinted. If you have checked
       the Processes tab in Task Manager and there is no f.lux process
       present, this means another program has absorbed the f.lux color
       profile. The workaround to restore your screen to its normal
       profile is as follows: Reinstall f.lux. In the Settings Menu, set
       both the Night and Daytime sliders to daylight. After 24 hours, any
       other programs should have re-absorbed the new profile, and you may
       uninstall f.lux with no more changed colors.
     * My Lenovo laptop is still tinted after uninstalling f.lux.
       Disable the "Lenovo Vantage Eye Care Mode".
     * My AMD Vega does not change colors at all.
       Try to upgrade to a driver version 19.9.1 or later.
     * My Windows 10 computer flickers at sunset.
       Disable Windows Night Light.
     * F.lux makes my mouse stutter, makes my computer slow, or it doesn't
       seem to change my colors at all.
       Most problems like this can be fixed by updating your video
       drivers.
       Try one of these links: NVIDIA drivers, AMD Radeon drivers, Intel
       drivers.
     * Uh oh, my Surface Pro 3 is freezing! (or my Intel-based laptop is
       slow with f.lux).
       Early-2014 Intel HD Windows 8.1 drivers have some bugs that give
       problems with f.lux, and you may not have the latest one (Surface
       Pro 3 does not as of September 2014). To make sure you have the
       latest:
         1. Run Device Manager and navigate to Display Adapters : Intel HD
            Graphics Family. Pick the "Driver" Tab.
         2. Check which version you have. If it's less than 10.18.10.3907,
            you'll want to update (the early-2014 drivers that end with
            "3412" up to "3621" can cause slowdowns and crashes with
            f.lux).
         3. Download a new intel driver here: Intel HD drivers
            If using a "standard" Intel video card, just get the EXE and
            install it. You're done! If using a Surface Pro 3 or
            "customized" OEM driver, pick the ZIP download so we can force
            the install.
         4. If you picked the ZIP, unzip it and then:
              1. Back in Device Manager, click "Update Driver" and "Browse
                 my computer..."
              2. Choose the Downloads folder and the zip folder you just
                 extracted.
              3. If Windows refuses this new driver, you should Uninstall
                 and Delete the existing driver and start again from step
                 #1. Windows will use its basic driver in the interim (you
                 won't be without video.)
     * Ok, but CCC.exe on my AMD Radeon card is still using 1% CPU all the
       time, and I don't want that.
       The Catalyst Control Center is an optional component that can be
       uninstalled, and you might consider doing this if you're not
       frequently adjusting your settings for gaming or other reasons. Use
       Add/Remove Programs, and choose "AMD Catalyst Install Manager" to
       proceed.
       Do not uninstall the Install Manager, but instead use it to
       uninstall Catalyst Control Center. In our test, this didn't even
       require a reboot. Also, leave a note on this page (with the driver
       version) so we can report it to AMD.
     * My Macbook Pro is having trouble with f.lux, and it flashes
       sometimes.
       On dual-GPU machines we write an ICC profile in order to make the
       "switch" between video cards more seamless. In some older machines,
       and every so often, this doesn't work so well. To read about how
       this system works and turn it off if you want, check out our
       description here:
       Notes about f.lux changes to ICC profiles.
       If your Macbook is crashing due to switching between cards, or just
       to understand when it happens, a really great workaround is to
       download gfxCardStatus and use only one of the two video cards.
     * My computer flickers when I use Parallels. What should I do?
       You can disable "use Windows gamma settings", and directions are in
       this post.
     * I use Shades on my Mac, and f.lux is fighting with it.
       Users have reported flashing and flickering when using these
       together. We recommend you only use one of these programs at a
       time.
     * I can't drag the program to the Trash on my Mac.
       First quit f.lux from the Settings menu, to the left of your system
       clock.
     * I adjusted my color / gamma settings using Windows "Calibrate
       Display" or NVIDIA's controls and f.lux removes them. Can you keep
       these settings and use f.lux?
       Unfortunately, these systems do not write their settings in a
       format that f.lux can access (we read VCGT headers only). For
       better results, we recommend the use of hardware calibrators such
       as the very good x-rite i1 Display or ColorMunki Display, which
       write settings in standard ICC files that f.lux can read. If you
       don't have access to a device like this, you might find a suitable
       profile for your display online at the TFT Central Monitor Settings
       Database.
       Several people have reported that QuickGamma works well and
       produces good profiles that f.lux can read.
       If you use a Spyder, the software profile loader may cause f.lux to
       flash periodically. You can disable the Spyder software on startup,
       and use f.lux instead to load the profile. Also, when you're
       calibrating a display, you'll want to do the opposite and quit
       f.lux before you do.
     * My ASUS laptop is flickering for a minute after startup.
       See if you can find an "ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement" feature
       and uninstall it.
     * My Sony VAIO is flashing every time it wakes up.
       See if you can find a "Color Mode Setting" in Vaio Control Center >
       Display, and change it to "Do not apply color mode".
     * I have a new tablet (e.g., a Dell Latitude 10 or an ATIV 500T) that
       does nothing when I run f.lux. Is there a way to make f.lux work?
       These Atom-based machines use the PowerVR SGX545, a mobile-class
       video card that doesn't currently support color controls. We've had
       many reports of failures with this chipset, so right now we don't
       anticipate a better result.
     * I have a DisplayLink USB monitor adapter. Is there a way to make
       f.lux work for this display?
       Newer DisplayLink adapters have support for color calibration. See
       our forum post for instructions to enable it. On older adapters,
       f.lux will emulate this effect using the GPU, which can effect
       screenshots.
     * My PC's Anti-Virus program flagged f.lux as malware. As long as
       you've downloaded f.lux from this site, you don't have any malware.
       Every once in a while we get flagged as a potential threat due to
       the nature of our installer and updater. If this happens to you,
       please send us a note with your anti-virus program and details and
       we will contact them for review.
     * Something else is going wrong with f.lux for Windows
       We always recommend updating video drivers as a first line of
       defense. If you're experiencing flickering or problems, please
       upgrade your drivers. If that doesn't work, we love to fix bugs.
       Please send us a note with information on your operating system,
       video card, and any other information that might be helpful to us.
     * iOS: Why do I need Location Services enabled? f.lux uses Location
       Services to determine the time of your local sunrise and sunset. In
       the future we will include an option to choose times manually.
     * Why isn't f.lux available in the Apple App Store? I don't want to /
       can't jailbreak my device.
       We would love to make f.lux available for all iOS devices. To make
       f.lux work on iOS, we've had to go outside the bounds of what apps
       are normally allowed to do. Currently, iOS does not allow
       developers to access the Private APIs we need to make f.lux work on
       iOS.
       Apple values their customers' feedback, so if you have a minute to
       let them know how f.lux has helped you, and that you'd like to see
       it available for all iOS devices, send a note at iPhone feedback or
       iPad feedback.
     * When is the Android version coming out? f.lux on Android requires a
       rooted phone, but it's on the play store here.

f.lux v3 for Windows (2013 version)

     * What does Safe Mode do on Windows?
       Safe Mode does two things: 1. It disables our layered window for
       compatibility with some older machines. 2. It disables all polling
       we normally do to ensure that we're the active color profile.
       Logging in, changing video resolutions, and Administrator (UAC)
       prompts can all reset f.lux's color changes. With Safe Mode, we do
       not fix these automatically, in order to minimize the impact we
       have on the system. If an app resets the colors, you can click on
       the f.lux icon to have us restore our profile. Transitions
       (sunrise, sunset) still happen as usual. Use Safe Mode if you think
       f.lux slows down your computer.
     * I work nights. How do I flip the day and night settings?
       PC f.lux users can unlock the color temperature sliders by holding
       down the control key while setting your temperature, so night can
       be swapped with day. We're working on a feature that lets you
       control time settings more closely.
     * Since upgrading to Windows 10 Anniversary, my non-DisplayLink
       screen is flashing a lot, but only when I have my USB monitor or
       docking station plugged in Yes, we had a bug that caused this and
       the main build has been updated (v3.12). Please get an updated
       build here.

More questions

     * Plenty of things already change the brightness of my screen. Why is
       this different?
       f.lux changes the color temperature of your display. Natural light
       is more blue, while most artificial light (including candlelight)
       is warmer. Incandescent bulbs, which we're all used to, become more
       red in tone when you dim them. But newer LEDs and CFLs don't - this
       includes the backlight on your monitor. If you're a photographer,
       you've probably dealt with this, since pictures taken inside at
       night are always much more brown than photos outside.
     * Isn't this exactly the same as the Macbook ambient light sensor?
       No, though they do work together nicely. The ambient light sensor
       measures the brightness of the light in your room and adjusts the
       brightness of your screen based on that. f.lux changes the color of
       your screen and warms it up according to the type of light you're
       using and the time of day. f.lux doesn't use ambient brightness to
       adjust colors. You might be in a dark room with very cool light,
       you wouldn't really want your monitor to look warm, but you would
       want your display to look dimmer. We've found that when your screen
       colors match the color of your ambient light correctly, you don't
       need to adjust monitor brightness as much.
     * What is color temperature, exactly?
       The term color temperature is a way to numerically describe how
       much red or blue light is illuminating a room. Color temperature is
       measured in Kelvins, and is determined by the kind of light you're
       using. Confusingly, warmer (more red) light sources are described
       in lower degrees Kelvin. Compared to indoor lighting, daylight is
       cool - very blue. A candle is around 1800K, while a sunny day might
       be 6000K. An overcast day is more blue, so it might be around
       7000K. Most computer monitors display around 6500K. If you are
       using incandescent task lights behind your computer, those are
       around 3000K.
     * I'm a designer / photographer / artist so I can't use f.lux. This
       isn't for me!
       f.lux was created by people who care a lot about accuracy in
       colors. We know you want to make sure your colors are perfect so
       there is an option to disable f.lux for 1 hour at a time (for
       example, while using Photoshop). This setting returns your screen
       to its normal settings. In the future we plan to allow automatic
       disabling of f.lux when you launch certain programs. f.lux is not
       designed for use during advanced color work, but it's fine for
       layout or HTML.

Welcome to f.lux

   To install, run flux-setup.exe when your download is complete.

What to do first

     * Set your location. f.lux works a lot better if it knows when the
       sun rises and sets. The sun is the brightest light we see every
       day, so setting this up matters a lot for understanding your
       circadian timing
     * Choose your usual wake time. If you wake at a different time each
       day, you can pick a time on the earlier side
     * Adjust color settings so it looks as you like it. Just move the big
       slider to adjust, and f.lux will learn what you like
     * You can set f.lux to “disable” automatically for apps where color
       quality is critical
     * To quickly disable for an hour, use Alt-End
     * Visit our support page: https://justgetflux.com/faq.html

   After you install, you can always change colors, location, and other
   settings from the f.lux menu:

   f.lux menu

   The f.lux menu is always located to the left of your system clock.

What f.lux does

   The light that comes from computer and mobile phone screens has a real
   effect on the human circadian system, especially at night. Based on
   your wake time and location, f.lux creates a custom lighting schedule
   for you that changes every day throughout the year. By moving the
   sliders, you can fine tune the colors to fit your needs.

What’s new in v4 (2017)

     * Bedtime mode: this extra-warm mode gets you ready for sleep and
       also helps you customize f.lux’s timing to work better with your
       actual schedule
     * Circadian response is shown when you change settings, to show how
       light affects your circadian system
     * Backwards alarm clock reminds you how long it is until you wake up,
       hopefully to get you to bed a little earlier
     * Presets to help pick your settings, or reset things when you get
       stuck
     * Color filters for eyestrain and other uses
     * A wider range of color settings (including very cool colors)
     * You can tell f.lux to disable when particular apps are running, or
       when watching fullscreen movies and games
     * There are new hotkeys to adjust color a little bit at a time
       (Alt+Shift+PgUp and Alt+Shift+PgDn)

   What’s fixed:
     * Reduced impact on game framerates
     * Resolution independent interface, for high DPI
     * DisplayLink (when your monitor is connected via USB) works in a lot
       more cases now

   Smart Lighting:
     * Hue integration now supports more light types
     * LAN API with support for telling other devices when f.lux changes

New in v3 (2013)

   If you’ve used f.lux before, this version now has these changes:
     * Expanded color temperature settings, down to 2700K, and some
       presets lower than that, down to 1200K.
     * Display warms up as your backlight dims (works with laptops)
     * Movie mode
     * Disable until sunrise
     * A simple control for Philips Hue lights
     * Hotkeys to dim your screen (Alt-PgUp, Alt-PgDn), so desktop users
       can dim too, and a hotkey to disable (Alt-End)

More about f.lux

   Computer screens, tablets and mobile phones emit full spectrum light
   around the clock, just like the sun. Exposure to blue light at the
   wrong time of day can keep you awake later and interfere with the
   quality of your sleep. f.lux tries to help this by removing blue and
   green light to help you wind down in the evenings.

   It can take a few days to get used to the new colors at night, so we
   recommend setting the night-time colors in f.lux to whatever feels good
   to your eyes. After a few days with f.lux, experiment with the settings
   to warm things up a little more and find which color works best for
   you. Our default setting of 3400K on Windows removes about 3/4 of the
   blue and about half of the green light. You can remove even more
   alerting light by choosing “Expand color range” to unlock deeper colors
   in Windows (in the “Lighting at night” menu).

   Thank you for trying f.lux! We are always working to incorporate the
   newest research into our software. We’d love to hear what you think.

Welcome to f.lux for macOS

   Thanks for installing f.lux.

   Your f.lux installer is a .zip file - it should be in your Downloads
   folder. Install f.lux by double-clicking it.

   Once f.lux is installed and running, you should see the f.lux
   Preferences window appear. Here, you can enter your location and set
   your usual wake time. f.lux uses this information to create a custom
   lighting schedule for you.

   [mac_menu.png]

   You can open up Preferences any time to view and change your f.lux
   settings.

   The f.lux menu can always be found to the left of your system clock.

f.lux Preferences

   [mac_day.png]

   Daytime is whenever the sun is up in your location. By default, f.lux
   is at 6500K during the daytime, and does not change your screen’s
   color.

   If you prefer very warm daytime colors, select Options> Expanded
   Daytime Settings from the f.lux menu.

   [mac_sunset.png]

   Sunset is when the sun has set, but you are awake. If you are an early
   riser, this is also your pre-sunrise morning setting.

   Sunset colors are designed to work well with normal warm white room
   lighting. If you usually wake up before sunrise, you might prefer a
   more moderate (4500K or brighter) Sunset setting.

   [mac_bedtime.png]

   Bedtime is the time before sleep when you’re getting ready for bed (or
   already in it).

   The Bedtime setting changes with your wake time. It removes as much
   alerting light from your screen as possible so that you can feel your
   body growing tired. You can go to sleep anytime with f.lux - whenever
   you feel sleepy.

                                    . . .
     __________________________________________________________________

f.lux presets

   [mac_prefs.png]

   The f.lux preferences window lets you change and preview settings.
   There are several presets you can choose from. f.lux will default to
   the Recommended colors preset.

   Recommended colors: Use these for the first week while you get used to
   the change of colors and discover how you like to use f.lux.

   Custom colors: Custom color control, click the time of day you want to
   change and then drag the slider to your preferred color temperature.

   Classic f.lux: At sunset, f.lux will fade to 3400K, and turn off at
   sunrise. For large screens this setting is probably not strong enough
   to remove all alerting light.

   Working late: for extreme night owls, removes solar timing and gives 14
   hours of bright waking light.

                                    . . .
     __________________________________________________________________

Location

   [mac_map.png]

   For most machines, f.lux can automatically detect your location with OS
   X Location Services.

   You can also use postal codes (US only), the name of a nearby city, or
   map coordinates (find them on the map at justgetflux.com/map.html).

   If you’ve been traveling, you might need to update your location. Make
   sure your computer’s internal Timezone settings are correct under
   System Preferences > Date & Time > Time Zone

                                    . . .
     __________________________________________________________________

Options

   Fast transitions: 20 second fade at sunrise and sunset. When unchecked,
   f.lux changes gradually over one hour.

   Sleep in on weekends: For people who want brighter light later on
   Friday and Saturday nights (and sleep in on Saturday and Sunday
   mornings)

   Extra hour of sleep (ages 13-18): Starts Bedtime one hour earlier for
   teens and other people who need a little more sleep

   Expanded daytime settings: Warmer daytime settings (to 1900K) for
   people who want to reduce eyestrain or match office lighting

   Backwards alarm clock: Calculates how many hours remain until your wake
   time and gives reminders every thirty minutes when it gets very late

   Dim on disable: Gentle fade on disable so it hurts less to check colors

Color Effects

   Darkroom: Removes 100% of blue and green light and inverts colors.
   Darkroom mode also preserves night vision while using a screen.

   Movie mode: Lasts 2.5 hours. Preserves colors and shadow detail for
   watching movies with reduced alerting light.

   OS X Dark theme at sunset: Uses the normal theme during the day and
   switches to dark theme (dock and menu bar) each night at sunset.
   Disabling f.lux will also disable dark theme.

Disable

   For an hour: Disables f.lux for one hour and returns your screen to its
   normal setting.

   Until sunrise: Disables f.lux until your local sunrise.

   For current app: Open the app you want to disable f.lux for, then
   choose this option to disable f.lux whenever a particular app becomes
   active. You can re-enable f.lux later by opening the app and unchecking
   this option.

   If you often check colors after dark, you might like to use the Dim On
   Disable setting under Options.

                                    . . .

Troubleshooting: Answers to some common OS X questions

   Installing
    1. Click the f.lux Mac download link.
    2. Click the zip file to expand it
    3. Double click the "Flux" application in your Finder window.
    4. Enter your location and wake time

   Uninstalling
    1. Go to the f.lux Settings panel (to the left of your system clock)
    2. Choose "Quit f.lux"
    3. In Finder, search for "Flux" and select and delete the f.lux app by
       dragging it to the trash

   Uninstalled but can’t delete files
    1. Open Activity Monitor and select Flux
    2. Choose Force Quit
    3. Delete f.lux app by dragging it to the trash

   Quit f.lux but the color still remains

   Rebooting often fixes any problems with color tint. But if that does
   not help you, try the following:
    1. Open Activity Monitor and verify there is no "Flux" process running
    2. In Finder, open System Preferences> Displays> Color
    3. Delete the f.lux profile
    4. Reboot if needed

   Other video display issues

   Some Macbooks were recalled for problems with video hardware. You can
   check if your model is on the list at:
   https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/

   Flashing

   On dual-GPU machines we write an ICC profile in order to make the
   “switch” between video cards more seamless. In some older machines, and
   every so often, this doesn’t work so well. You can use gfx.io to lock
   to one card, or to read about how this system works and disable if you
   want, check out our f.lux profile + prefs article.

   If you still have questions about f.lux or need more help, you can
   check our FAQ or ask a question in our support forum.
