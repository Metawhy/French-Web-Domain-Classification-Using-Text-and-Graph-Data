     Michelle East Create Art with ME



  Create Art with ME – Michelle East

   Hi! Welcome to Create Art with ME. My name is Michelle East and I have
   the privilege of wearing many hats: Wife, Mother, Artist, Art Teacher.
   The foundation of all these hats is my Faith in Christ. I teach 5th
   grade art through AP Advanced High School Art at a private Christian
   School in Cedar Park, Texas. The projects on this site are successful
   art lessons that I have taught with my classes and I hope that you will
   be inspired to create art with your own children or students too! Enjoy
   the whole process of creating, do not just be focused on the end
   product! If you want to use these lessons on your site or curriculum,
   please link back to this blog!
