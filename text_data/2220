   Feeling bored? Uninspired by life? Do you need four cups of coffee just
   to break the monotony of the 9 to 5? Fortunately, there is one special
   day in December that will alleviate these common maladies. That day, my
   friends, is National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day on Friday, December
   20th, 2019! National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day is about proudly
   sporting your favorite ugly Christmas sweater for the entire
   day...regardless of circumstances. Wear it to school, to work, to a
   funeral, to your sister's wedding. Got an important interview on
   Friday? Oops, tough luck. Worried the judge will increase your sentence
   if you show up to court in an ugly Christmas sweater? Sorry bud, no
   exceptions. Share this special day with your friends and spread the
   word until your face falls off. Also, please send us pictures strutting
   your stuff in an ugly Christmas sweater. Let's rock this!

Visit our official sponsor Tipsy Elves logo

   Tipsy Elves designs and sells some of the coolest (and funniest)
   Christmas sweaters out there and they have a variety of ugly Christmas
   sweaters for women and men. They have a great collection of "naughty
   sweaters," of which the Snowman Nose Thief Sweater is a favorite among
   our team. Tipsy Elves stands alone as the true leader in the Christmas
   sweater space and their quality and customer service is second to none.
   They also have a donation program where a portion of proceeds from
   their sweater sales is dedicated to donating hoodies to children's
   organizations each year. For more information about being our sponsor,
   email us here.
