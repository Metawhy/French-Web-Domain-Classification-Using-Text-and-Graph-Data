   Karol Lewandowski Ola Slusarczyk

   Hi! :) We are Karol "Charlie" Lewandowski and Aleksandra "Alex"
   Slusarczyk and we are travel bloggers from Poland. We are traveling
   around the world with our old van bought for $600 and we always try to
   do it as cheap as possible.

   In 6 years we visited over 50 countries on 5 continents and drove more
   then 150.000 km. Our blog won the Best Travel Blog of the Year award.
