                   Meshmixer is state-of-the-art software
                      for working with triangle meshes.

    Do you need to clean up a 3D scan, do some 3D printing, or design an
    object that fits something else? Meshmixer can help. Think of it as a
                  sort of "Swiss Army Knife" for 3D meshes.

        Here are a few examples of how Meshmixer is being used today:
