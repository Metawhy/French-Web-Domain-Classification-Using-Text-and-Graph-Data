   Abstract
   Back to toptop

   Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO[2]) emissions
   and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial
   biosphere – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better
   understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate
   policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets
   and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global
   carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO[2] emissions (E[FF])
   are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while
   emissions from land use and land-use change (E[LUC]), mainly
   deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and
   bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO[2] concentration is measured
   directly and its growth rate (G[ATM]) is computed from the annual
   changes in concentration. The ocean CO[2] sink (S[OCEAN]) and
   terrestrial CO[2] sink (S[LAND]) are estimated with global process
   models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget
   imbalance (B[IM]), the difference between the estimated total emissions
   and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial
   biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the
   contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For
   the last decade available (2008–2017), E[FF] was 9.4±0.5 GtC yr^−1,
   E[LUC] 1.5±0.7 GtC yr^−1, G[ATM] 4.7±0.02 GtC yr^−1, S[OCEAN]
   2.4±0.5 GtC yr^−1, and S[LAND] 3.2±0.8 GtC yr^−1, with a budget
   imbalance B[IM] of 0.5 GtC yr^−1 indicating overestimated emissions
   and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2017 alone, the growth in
   E[FF] was about 1.6 % and emissions increased to 9.9±0.5 GtC yr^−1.
   Also for 2017, E[LUC] was 1.4±0.7 GtC yr^−1, G[ATM] was
   4.6±0.2 GtC yr^−1, S[OCEAN] was 2.5±0.5 GtC yr^−1, and S[LAND] was
   3.8±0.8 GtC yr^−1, with a B[IM] of 0.3 GtC. The global atmospheric
   CO[2]concentration reached 405.0±0.1 ppm averaged over 2017. For 2018,
   preliminary data for the first 6–9 months indicate a renewed growth in
   E[FF] of +2.7 % (range of 1.8 % to 3.7 %) based on national emission
   projections for China, the US, the EU, and India and projections of
   gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon
   intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. The analysis
   presented here shows that the mean and trend in the five components of
   the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period of
   1959–2017, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr^−1 persist for the
   representation of semi-decadal variability in CO[2] fluxes. A detailed
   comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad
   range of observations show (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in
   land-use change emissions, (2) a persistent low agreement among the
   different methods on the magnitude of the land CO[2] flux in the
   northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the
   CO[2]variability by ocean models, originating outside the tropics. This
   living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used
   in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding the
   global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data
   set (Le Quéré et al., 2018, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013). All results

   1 Introduction
   Back to toptop

   The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO[2]) in the atmosphere has
   increased from approximately 277 parts per million (ppm) in 1750 (Joos
   and Spahni, 2008), the beginning of the industrial era, to
   405.0±0.1 ppm in 2017 (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2018; Fig. 1). The
   atmospheric CO[2] increase above pre-industrial levels was, initially,
   primarily caused by the release of carbon to the atmosphere from
   deforestation and other land-use change activities (Ciais et al.,
   2013). While emissions from fossil fuels started before the industrial
   era, they only became the dominant source of anthropogenic emissions to
   the atmosphere around 1950 and their relative share has continued to
   increase until present. Anthropogenic emissions occur on top of an
   active natural carbon cycle that circulates carbon among the reservoirs
   of the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere on timescales from
   sub-daily to millennial, while exchanges with geologic reservoirs occur
   at longer timescales (Archer et al., 2009).

   The global carbon budget presented here refers to the mean, variations,
   and trends in the perturbation of CO[2] in the environment, referenced
   to the beginning of the industrial era. It quantifies the input of
   CO[2]to the atmosphere by emissions from human activities, the growth
   rate of atmospheric CO[2] concentration, and the resulting changes in
   the storage of carbon in the land and ocean reservoirs in response to
   increasing atmospheric CO[2] levels, climate change, and variability
   and other anthropogenic and natural changes (Fig. 2). An understanding
   of this perturbation budget over time and the underlying variability
   and trends in the natural carbon cycle is necessary to understand the
   response of natural sinks to changes in climate, CO[2] and land-use
   change drivers, and the permissible emissions for a given climate
   stabilisation target.

   Figure 1Surface average atmospheric CO[2] concentration (ppm). The
   1980–2018 monthly data are from NOAA/ESRL (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2018)
   and are based on an average of direct atmospheric CO[2] measurements
   from multiple stations in the marine boundary layer (Masarie and Tans,
   1995). The 1958–1979 monthly data are from the Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography, based on an average of direct atmospheric CO[2]
   measurements from the Mauna Loa and South Pole stations (Keeling et
   al., 1976). To take into account the difference of mean CO[2] and
   seasonality between the NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps station networks used
   here, the Scripps surface average (from two stations) was
   deseasonalised and harmonised to match the NOAA/ESRL surface average
   (from multiple stations) by adding the mean difference of 0.542 ppm,
   calculated here from overlapping data during 1980–2012.

   The components of the CO[2] budget that are reported annually in this
   paper include separate estimates for (1) the CO[2] emissions from
   fossil fuel combustion and oxidation from all energy and industrial
   processes and cement production (E[FF]; GtC yr^−1); (2) the emissions
   resulting from deliberate human activities on land, including those
   leading to land-use change (E[LUC]; GtC yr^−1); and (3) their
   partitioning among the growth rate of atmospheric CO[2] concentration
   (G[ATM]; GtC yr^−1), the uptake of CO[2] (the “CO[2] sinks”) in (4) the
   ocean (S[OCEAN]; GtC yr^−1), and (5) the uptake of CO[2] on land
   (S[LAND]; GtC yr^−1). The CO[2] sinks as defined here conceptually
   include the response of the land (including inland waters and
   estuaries) and ocean (including coasts and territorial sea) to elevated
   CO[2] and changes in climate, rivers, and other environmental
   conditions, although in practice not all processes are accounted for
   (see Sect. 2.8). The global emissions and their partitioning among the
   atmosphere, ocean, and land are in reality in balance; however due to
   imperfect spatial and/or temporal data coverage, errors in each
   estimate, and smaller terms not included in our budget estimate
   (discussed in Sect. 2.8), their sum does not necessarily add up to
   zero. We estimate a budget imbalance (B[IM]), which is a measure of the
   mismatch between the estimated emissions and the estimated changes in
   the atmosphere, land, and ocean, with the full global carbon budget as
   follows:

   G[ATM] is usually reported in ppm yr^−1, which we convert to units of
   carbon mass per year, GtC yr^−1, using 1 ppm =2.124 GtC (Table 1). We
   also include a quantification of E[FF] by country, computed with both
   territorial and consumption-based accounting (see Sect. 2), and discuss
   missing terms from sources other than the combustion of fossil fuels
   (see Sect. 2.8).

   Table 1Factors used to convert carbon in various units (by convention,
   Unit 1 = Unit 2 conversion).

   ^a Measurements of atmospheric CO[2] concentration have units of
   dry-air mole fraction. “ppm” is an abbreviation for micromole mol^−1,
   dry air. ^b The use of a factor of 2.124 assumes that all the
   atmosphere is well mixed within 1 year. In reality, only the
   troposphere is well mixed and the growth rate of CO[2] concentration in
   the less well-mixed stratosphere is not measured by sites from the NOAA
   network. Using a factor of 2.124 makes the approximation that the
   growth rate of CO[2] concentration in the stratosphere equals that of
   the troposphere on a yearly basis.

   The CO[2] budget has been assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) in all assessment reports (Ciais et al., 2013;
   Denman et al., 2007; Prentice et al., 2001; Schimel et al., 1995;
   Watson et al., 1990), and by others (e.g. Ballantyne et al., 2012). The
   IPCC methodology has been adapted and used by the Global Carbon Project
   (GCP, http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/, last access:
   30 November 2018), which has coordinated a cooperative community effort
   for the annual publication of global carbon budgets up to the year 2005
   (Raupach et al., 2007; including fossil emissions only), the year 2006
   (Canadell et al., 2007), the year 2007 (published online; GCP, 2007),
   the year 2008 (Le Quéré et al., 2009), the year 2009 (Friedlingstein et
   al., 2010), the year 2010 (Peters et al., 2012b), the year 2012 (Le
   Quéré et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2013), the year 2013 (Le Quéré et
   al., 2014), the year 2014 (Friedlingstein et al., 2014; Le Quéré et
   al., 2015b), the year 2015 (Jackson et al., 2016; Le Quéré et al.,
   2015a), the year 2016 (Le Quéré et al., 2016), and most recently the
   year 2017 (Le Quéré et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2017). Each of these
   papers updated previous estimates with the latest available information
   for the entire time series.

   We adopt a range of ±1 standard deviation (σ) to report the
   uncertainties in our estimates, representing a likelihood of 68 % that
   the true value will be within the provided range if the errors have a
   Gaussian distribution and no bias is assumed. This choice reflects the
   difficulty of characterising the uncertainty in the CO[2] fluxes
   between the atmosphere and the ocean and land reservoirs individually,
   particularly on an annual basis, as well as the difficulty of updating
   the CO[2] emissions from land use and land-use change. A likelihood of
   68 % provides an indication of our current capability to quantify each
   term and its uncertainty given the available information. For
   comparison, the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR5) generally
   reported a likelihood of 90 % for large data sets whose uncertainty is
   well characterised or for long time intervals less affected by
   year-to-year variability. Our 68 % uncertainty value is near the 66 %
   which the IPCC characterises as “likely” for values falling into the
   ±1σ interval. The uncertainties reported here combine statistical
   analysis of the underlying data and expert judgement of the likelihood
   of results lying outside this range. The limitations of current
   information are discussed in the paper and have been examined in detail
   elsewhere (Ballantyne et al., 2015; Zscheischler et al., 2017). We also
   use a qualitative assessment of confidence level to characterise the
   annual estimates from each term based on the type, amount, quality, and
   consistency of the evidence as defined by the IPCC (Stocker et al.,
   2013).

   All quantities are presented in units of gigatonnes of carbon (GtC,
   10^15 gC), which is the same as petagrams of carbon (PgC; Table 1).
   Units of gigatonnes of CO[2] (or billion tonnes of CO[2]) used in
   policy are equal to 3.664 multiplied by the value in units of GtC.

   This paper provides a detailed description of the data sets and
   methodology used to compute the global carbon budget estimates for the
   pre-industrial period (1750) to 2017 and in more detail for the period
   since 1959. It also provides decadal averages starting in 1960
   including the last decade (2008–2017), results for the year 2017, and a
   projection for the year 2018. Finally it provides cumulative emissions
   from fossil fuels and land-use change since the year 1750, the
   pre-industrial period, and since the year 1870, the reference year for
   the cumulative carbon estimate used by the IPCC (AR5) based on the
   availability of global temperature data (Stocker et al., 2013). This
   paper is updated every year using the format of “living data” to keep a
   record of budget versions and the changes in new data, revision of
   data, and changes in methodology that lead to changes in estimates of
   the carbon budget. Additional materials associated with the release of
   each new version will be posted at the Global Carbon Project (GCP)
   website (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget, last access:
   30 November 2018), with fossil fuel emissions also available through
   the Global Carbon Atlas (http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org, last access:
   30 November 2018). With this approach, we aim to provide the highest
   transparency and traceability in the reporting of CO[2], the key driver
   of climate change.
   2 Methods
   Back to toptop

   Multiple organisations and research groups around the world generated
   the original measurements and data used to complete the global carbon
   budget. The effort presented here is thus mainly one of synthesis, in
   which results from individual groups are collated, analysed, and
   evaluated for consistency. We facilitate access to original data with
   the understanding that primary data sets will be referenced in future
   work (see Table 2 for how to cite the data sets). Descriptions of the
   measurements, models, and methodologies follow below and in depth
   descriptions of each component are described elsewhere.

   budget presented here.

   This is the 13th version of the global carbon budget and the seventh
   revised version in the format of a living data update. It builds on the
   latest published global carbon budget of Le Quéré et al. (2018). The
   main changes are (1) the inclusion of data to the year 2017 (inclusive)
   and a projection for the global carbon budget for the year 2018;
   (2) the introduction of metrics that evaluate components of the
   individual models used to estimate S[OCEAN] and S[LAND] using
   observations, as an effort to document, encourage, and support model
   improvements through time; (3) the revisions of the CO[2] emissions
   associated with cement production based on revised clinker ratios;
   (4) a projection for fossil fuel emissions for the 28 European Union
   member states based on compiled energy statistics; and (5) the addition
   of Sect. 2.8.2 on additional emissions from calcination not included in
   the budget. The main methodological differences among annual carbon
   budgets are summarised in Table 3.

   Table 3Main methodological changes in the global carbon budget since
   first publication. Methodological changes introduced in one year are
   kept for the following years unless noted. Empty cells mean there were
   no methodological changes introduced that year.

2.1 Fossil CO[2] emissions (E[FF])

2.1.1 Emission estimates

   The estimates of global and national fossil CO[2] emissions (E[FF])
   include the combustion of fossil fuels through a wide range of
   activities (e.g. transport, heating, and cooling, industry, fossil
   industry's own use, and gas flaring), the production of cement, and
   other process emissions (e.g. the production of chemicals and
   fertilisers). The estimates of E[FF] rely primarily on energy
   consumption data, specifically data on hydrocarbon fuels, collated and
   archived by several organisations (Andres et al., 2012). We use four
   main data sets for historical emissions (1751–2017).
    1. We use global and national emission estimates for coal, oil, and
       gas from CDIAC for the time period of 1751–2014 (Boden et al.,
       2017), as it is the only data set that extends back to 1751 by
       country.
    2. We use official UNFCCC national inventory reports for 1990–2016 for
       the 42 Annex I countries in the UNFCCC (UNFCCC, 2018). We assess
       these to be the most accurate estimates because they are compiled
       by experts within countries that have access to detailed energy
       data, and they are periodically reviewed.
    3. We use the BP Statistical Review of World Energy (BP, 2018), as
       these are the most up-to-date estimates of national energy
       statistics.
    4. We use global and national cement emissions updated from
       Andrew (2018), which include revised emission factors.

   In the following section we provide more details for each data set and
   describe the additional modifications that are required to make the
   data set consistent and usable.
     * CDIAC. The CDIAC estimates have been updated annually to the year
       2014, derived primarily from energy statistics published by the
       United Nations (UN, 2017b). Fuel masses and volumes are converted
       to fuel energy content using country-level coefficients provided by
       the UN and then converted to CO[2] emissions using conversion
       factors that take into account the relationship between carbon
       content and energy (heat) content of the different fuel types
       (coal, oil, gas, gas flaring) and the combustion efficiency
       (Marland and Rotty, 1984).
     * UNFCCC. Estimates from the UNFCCC national inventory reports follow
       the IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 2006) but have a slightly larger system
       boundary than CDIAC by including emissions coming from carbonates
       other than in cement manufacturing. We reallocate the detailed
       UNFCCC estimates to the CDIAC definitions of coal, oil, gas,
       cement, and other to allow consistent comparisons over time and
       among countries.
     * BP. For the most recent period when the UNFCCC (2018) and CDIAC
       (2015–2017) estimates are not available, we generate preliminary
       estimates using the BP Statistical Review of World Energy (Andres
       et al., 2014; Myhre et al., 2009; BP, 2018). We apply the BP growth
       rates by fuel type (coal, oil, gas) to estimate 2017 emissions
       based on 2016 estimates (UNFCCC) and to estimate 2015–2017
       emissions based on 2014 estimates (CDIAC). BP's data set explicitly
       covers about 70 countries (96 % of global emissions), and for the
       remaining countries we use growth rates from the subregion the
       country belongs to. For the most recent years, flaring is assumed
       constant from the most recent available year of data (2016 for
       countries that report to the UNFCCC, 2014 for the remainder).
     * Cement. Estimates of emissions from cement production are taken
       directly from Andrew (2018). Additional calcination and carbonation
       processes are not included explicitly here, except in national
       inventories provided by UNFCCC, but are discussed in Sect. 2.8.2.
     * Country mappings. The published CDIAC data set includes 256
       countries and regions. This list includes countries that no longer
       exist, such as the USSR and Yugoslavia. We reduce the list to 213
       countries by reallocating emissions to the currently defined
       territories, using mass-preserving aggregation or disaggregation.
       Examples of aggregation include merging East and West Germany to
       the currently defined Germany. Examples of disaggregation include
       reallocating the emissions from the former USSR to the resulting
       independent countries. For disaggregation, we use the emission
       shares when the current territories first appeared, and thus
       historical estimates of disaggregated countries should be treated
       with extreme care. In addition, we aggregate some overseas
       territories (e.g. Réunion, Guadeloupe) into their governing nations
       (e.g. France) to align with UNFCCC reporting.
     * Global total. Our global estimate is based on CDIAC for fossil fuel
       combustion plus Andrew (2018) for cement emissions. This is greater
       than the sum of emissions from all countries. This is largely
       attributable to emissions that occur in international territory, in
       particular, the combustion of fuels used in international shipping
       and aviation (bunker fuels). The emissions from international
       bunker fuels are calculated based on where the fuels were loaded,
       but we do not include them in the national emission estimates.
       Other differences occur (1) because the sum of imports in all
       countries is not equal to the sum of exports, and (2) because of
       inconsistent national reporting, differing treatment of oxidation
       of non-fuel uses of hydrocarbons (e.g. as solvents, lubricants,
       feedstocks), and (3) because of changes in fuel stored (Andres et
       al., 2012).

2.2 Uncertainty assessment for E[FF]

   We estimate the uncertainty of the global fossil CO[2] emissions at
   ±5 % (scaled down from the published ±10 % at ±2σ to the use of ±1σ
   bounds reported here; Andres et al., 2012). This is consistent with a
   more detailed recent analysis of uncertainty of ±8.4 % at ±2σ (Andres
   et al., 2014) and at the high end of the range of ±5–10 % at ±2σ
   reported by Ballantyne et al. (2015). This includes an assessment of
   uncertainties in the amounts of fuel consumed, the carbon and heat
   contents of fuels, and the combustion efficiency. While we consider a
   fixed uncertainty of ±5 % for all years, the uncertainty as a
   percentage of the emissions is growing with time because of the larger
   share of global emissions from emerging economies and developing
   countries (Marland et al., 2009). Generally, emissions from mature
   economies with good statistical processes have an uncertainty of only a
   few per cent (Marland, 2008), while emissions from developing countries
   such as China have uncertainties of around ±10 % (for ±1σ; Gregg et
   al., 2008). Uncertainties of emissions are likely to be mainly
   systematic errors related to underlying biases of energy statistics and
   to the accounting method used by each country.

   We assign a medium confidence to the results presented here because
   they are based on indirect estimates of emissions using energy data
   (Durant et al., 2011). There is only limited and indirect evidence for
   emissions, although there is high agreement among the available
   estimates within the given uncertainty (Andres et al., 2012, 2014), and
   emission estimates are consistent with a range of other observations
   (Ciais et al., 2013), even though their regional and national
   partitioning is more uncertain (Francey et al., 2013).

2.2.1 Emissions embodied in goods and services

   CDIAC, UNFCCC, and BP national emission statistics “include greenhouse
   gas emissions and removals taking place within national territory and
   offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction” (Rypdal et al.,
   2006) and are called territorial emission inventories.
   Consumption-based emission inventories allocate emissions to products
   that are consumed within a country and are conceptually calculated as
   the territorial emissions minus the “embodied” territorial emissions to
   produce exported products plus the emissions in other countries to
   produce imported products (consumption = territorial − exports +
   imports). Consumption-based emission attribution results (e.g. Davis
   and Caldeira, 2010) provide additional information to territorial-based
   emissions that can be used to understand emission drivers (Hertwich and
   Peters, 2009) and quantify emission transfers by the trade of products
   between countries (Peters et al., 2011b). The consumption-based
   emissions have the same global total but reflect the trade-driven
   movement of emissions across the Earth's surface in response to human
   activities.

   We estimate consumption-based emissions from 1990 to 2016 by
   enumerating the global supply chain using a global model of the
   economic relationships between economic sectors within and among every
   country (Andrew and Peters, 2013; Peters et al., 2011a). Our analysis
   is based on the economic and trade data from the Global Trade and
   Analysis Project (GTAP; Narayanan et al., 2015), and we make detailed
   estimates for the years 1997 (GTAP version 5), 2001 (GTAP6), and 2004,
   2007, and 2011 (GTAP9.2), covering 57 sectors and 141 countries and
   regions. The detailed results are then extended into an annual time
   series from 1990 to the latest year of the gross domestic product (GDP)
   data (2016 in this budget), using GDP data by expenditure in the
   current exchange rate of US dollars (USD; from the UN National Accounts
   Main Aggregrates Database; UN, 2017a) and time series of trade data
   from GTAP (based on the methodology in Peters et al., 2011b). We
   estimate the sector-level CO[2] emissions using the GTAP data and
   methodology, include flaring and cement emissions from CDIAC, and then
   scale the national totals (excluding bunker fuels) to match the
   emission estimates from the carbon budget. We do not provide a separate
   uncertainty estimate for the consumption-based emissions, but based on
   model comparisons and sensitivity analysis, they are unlikely to be
   significantly different than for the territorial emission estimates
   (Peters et al., 2012a).

2.2.2 Growth rate in emissions

   We report the annual growth rate in emissions for adjacent years (in
   per cent per year) by calculating the difference between the two years
   and then normalising to the emissions in the first year:

   . We apply a leap-year adjustment when relevant to ensure valid
   interpretations of annual growth rates. This affects the growth rate by
   about 0.3 % yr^−1 (1∕365) and causes growth rates to go up
   approximately 0.3 % if the first year is a leap year and down 0.3 % if
   the second year is a leap year.

   The relative growth rate of E[FF] over time periods of greater than 1
   year can be rewritten using its logarithm equivalent as follows:

   Here we calculate relative growth rates in emissions for multi-year
   periods (e.g. a decade) by fitting a linear trend to ln(E[FF]) in
   Eq. (2), reported in per cent per year.

2.2.3 Emission projections

   To gain insight into emission trends for the current year (2018), we
   provide an assessment of global fossil CO[2] emissions, E[FF], by
   combining individual assessments of emissions for China, the US, the
   EU, and India (the four countries/regions with the largest emissions),
   and the rest of the world.

   Our 2018 estimate for China uses (1) the sum of domestic production
   (NBS, 2018b) and net imports (General Administration of Customs of the
   People's Republic of China, 2018) for coal, oil and natural gas, and
   production of cement (NBS, 2018b) from preliminary statistics for
   January through September of 2018 and (2) historical relationships
   between January–September statistics for both production and imports
   and full-year statistics for consumption using final data for 2000–2016
   (NBS, 2015, 2017) and preliminary data for 2017 (NBS, 2018a). See also
   Liu et al. (2018) and Jackson et al. (2018) for details. The
   uncertainty is based on the variance of the difference between the
   January–September and full-year data from historical data, as well as
   typical variance in the preliminary full-year data used for 2017 and
   typical changes in the energy content of coal for the period of
   2013–2016 (NBS, 2017, 2015). We note that developments for the final 3
   months this year may be atypical due to the ongoing trade disputes
   between China and the US, and this additional uncertainty has not been
   quantified. Results and uncertainties are discussed further in
   Sect. 3.4.1.

   For the US, we use the forecast of the U.S. Energy Information
   Administration (EIA) for emissions from fossil fuels (EIA, 2018). This
   is based on an energy forecasting model which is updated monthly (last
   update to October) and takes into account heating-degree days,
   household expenditures by fuel type, energy markets, policies, and
   other effects. We combine this with our estimate of emissions from
   cement production using the monthly US cement data from the U.S.
   Geological Survey (USGS) for January–August, assuming changes in cement
   production over the first part of the year apply throughout the year.
   While the EIA's forecasts for current full-year emissions have on
   average been revised downwards, only 10 such forecasts are available,
   so we conservatively use the full range of adjustments following
   revision and additionally assume symmetrical uncertainty to give ±2.5 %
   around the central forecast.

   For India, we use (1) monthly coal production and sales data from the
   Ministry of Mines (2018), Coal India Limited (CIL, 2018), and Singareni
   Collieries Company Limited (SCCL, 2018), combined with import data from
   the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI, 2018) and power station
   stocks data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA, 2018);
   (2) monthly oil production and consumption data from the Ministry of
   Petroleum and Natural Gas (PPAC, 2018a); (3) monthly natural gas
   production and import data from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural
   Gas (PPAC, 2018b); and (4) monthly cement production data from the
   Office of the Economic Advisor (OEA, 2018). All data were available for
   January to September or October. We use Holt–Winters exponential
   smoothing with multiplicative seasonality (Chatfield, 1978) on each of
   these four emission series to project to the end of the current year.
   This iterative method produces estimates of both trend and seasonality
   at the end of the observation period that are a function of all prior
   observations, weighted most strongly to more recent data, while
   maintaining some smoothing effect. The main source of uncertainty in
   the projection of India's emissions is the assumption of continued
   trends and typical seasonality.

   For the EU, we use (1) monthly coal supply data from Eurostat for the
   first 6–9 months of the year (Eurostat, 2018) cross-checked with more
   recent data on coal-generated electricity from ENTSO-E for January
   through October (ENTSO-E, 2018); (2) monthly oil and gas demand data
   for January through August from the Joint Organisations Data Initiative
   (JODI, 2018); and (3) cement production assumed to be stable. For oil
   and gas emissions we apply the Holt–Winters method separately to each
   country and energy carrier to project to the end of the current year,
   while for coal – which is much less strongly seasonal because of strong
   weather variations – we assume the remaining months of the year are the
   same as the previous year in each country.

   For the rest of the world, we use the close relationship between the
   growth in GDP and the growth in emissions (Raupach et al., 2007) to
   project emissions for the current year. This is based on a simplified
   Kaya identity, whereby E[FF] (GtC yr^−1) is decomposed by the product
   of GDP (USD yr^−1) and the fossil fuel carbon intensity of the economy
   (I[FF]; GtC USD^−1) as follows:

   where the left-hand term is the relative growth rate of E[FF], and the
   right-hand terms are the relative growth rates of GDP and I[FF],
   respectively, which can simply be added linearly to give the overall
   growth rate.

   The growth rates are reported in per cent by multiplying each term by
   100. As preliminary estimates of annual change in GDP are made well
   before the end of a calendar year, making assumptions on the growth
   rate of I[FF] allows us to make projections of the annual change in
   CO[2] emissions well before the end of a calendar year. The I[FF] is
   based on GDP in constant PPP (purchasing power parity) from the
   International Energy Agency (IEA) up until 2016 (IEA/OECD, 2017) and
   extended using the International Monetary Fund (IMF) growth rates for
   2016 and 2017 (IMF, 2018). Interannual variability in I[FF] is the
   largest source of uncertainty in the GDP-based emission projections. We
   thus use the standard deviation of the annual I[FF] for the period of
   2007–2017 as a measure of uncertainty, reflecting a ±1σ as in the rest
   of the carbon budget. This is ±1.0 % yr^−1 for the rest of the world
   (global emissions minus China, the US, the EU, and India).

   The 2018 projection for the world is made of the sum of the projections
   for China, the US, the EU, India, and the rest of the world. The
   uncertainty is added in quadrature among the five regions. The
   uncertainty here reflects the best of our expert opinion.

2.3 CO[2] emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (E[LUC])

   The net CO[2] flux from land use, land-use change, and forestry
   (E[LUC], called land-use change emissions in the rest of the text)
   include CO[2] fluxes from deforestation, afforestation, logging and
   forest degradation (including harvest activity), shifting cultivation
   (cycle of cutting forest for agriculture, then abandoning), and
   regrowth of forests following wood harvest or abandonment of
   agriculture. Only some land management activities are included in our
   land-use change emission estimates (Table A1 in the Appendix). Some of
   these activities lead to emissions of CO[2] to the atmosphere, while
   others lead to CO[2] sinks. E[LUC] is the net sum of emissions and
   removals due to all anthropogenic activities considered. Our annual
   estimate for 1959–2017 is provided as the average of results from two
   bookkeeping models (Sect. 2.3.1): the estimate published by Houghton
   and Nassikas (2017; hereafter H&N2017) extended here to 2017 and an
   estimate using the BLUE model (Bookkeeping of Land Use Emissions;
   Hansis et al., 2015). In addition, we use results from dynamic global
   vegetation models (DGVMs; see Sect. 2.3.3 and Table 4) to help quantify
   the uncertainty in E[LUC] and thus better characterise our
   understanding. The three methods are described below, and differences
   are discussed in Sect. 3.2.

   Table 4References for the process models, pCO[2]-based ocean flux
   products, and atmospheric inversions included in Figs. 6–8. All models
   and products are updated with new data to the end of the year 2017, and
   the atmospheric forcing for the DGVMs has been updated as described in
   Sect. 2.3.2.
   [essd-10-2141-2018-t04-thumb.png]

   ^a The forcing for all DGVMs has been updated from CRUNCEP to CRU–JRA.
   ^b To account for the differences between the derivation of shortwave
   radiation (SWRAD) from CRU cloudiness and SWRAD from CRU–JRA-55, the
   photosynthesis scaling parameter α[a] was modified (−15 %) to yield
   similar results. ^c Compared to the published version, LPJ wood harvest
   efficiency was decreased so that 50 % of biomass was removed off-site
   compared to 85 % used in the 2012 budget. Residue management of managed
   grasslands increased so that 100 % of harvested grass enters the litter
   pool. ^d Compared to the published version, new hydrology and snow
   scheme; revised parameter values for photosynthetic capacity for all
   ecosystem (following assimilation of FLUXNET data), updated parameters
   values for stem allocation, maintenance respiration, and biomass export
   for tropical forests (based on literature), and CO[2] down-regulation
   process added to photosynthesis. Version used for CMIP6. ^e No nutrient

2.3.1 Bookkeeping models

   Land-use change CO[2] emissions and uptake fluxes are calculated by two
   bookkeeping models. Both are based on the original bookkeeping approach
   of Houghton (2003) that keeps track of the carbon stored in vegetation
   and soils before and after a land-use change (transitions between
   various natural vegetation types, croplands, and pastures).
   Literature-based response curves describe decay of vegetation and soil
   carbon, including transfer to product pools of different lifetimes, as
   well as carbon uptake due to regrowth. In addition, the bookkeeping
   models represent long-term degradation of primary forest as lowered
   standing vegetation and soil carbon stocks in secondary forests and
   also include forest management practices such as wood harvests.

   The bookkeeping models do not include land ecosystems' transient
   response to changes in climate, atmospheric CO[2], and other
   environmental factors, and the carbon densities are based on
   contemporary data reflecting environmental conditions at (and up to)
   that time. Since carbon densities remain fixed over time in bookkeeping
   models, the additional sink capacity that ecosystems provide in
   response to CO[2] fertilisation and some other environmental changes is
   not captured by these models (Pongratz et al., 2014; see Sect. 2.8.4).

   The H&N2017 and BLUE models differ in (1) computational units (country
   level vs. spatially explicit treatment of land-use change),
   (2) processes represented (see Table A1), and (3) carbon densities
   assigned to vegetation and soil of each vegetation type. A notable
   change of H&N2017 over the original approach by Houghton et al. (2003)
   used in earlier budget estimates is that no shifting cultivation or
   other back-and-forth transitions below the country level are included.
   Only a decline in forest area in a country as indicated by the Forest
   Resource Assessment of the FAO that exceeds the expansion of
   agricultural area as indicated by the FAO is assumed to represent a
   concurrent expansion and abandonment of cropland. In contrast, the BLUE
   model includes sub-grid-scale transitions at the grid level among all
   vegetation types as indicated by the harmonised land-use change data
   (LUH2) data set (https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/input4MIPs.1127; Hurtt
   et al., 2011, 2018). Furthermore, H&N2017 assume conversion of natural
   grasslands to pasture, while BLUE allocates pasture proportionally on
   all natural vegetation that exists in a grid cell. This is one reason
   for generally higher emissions in BLUE. H&N2017 add carbon emissions
   from peat burning based on the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED4s;
   van der Werf et al., 2017) and peat drainage based on estimates by
   Hooijer et al. (2010) to the output of their bookkeeping model for the
   countries of Indonesia and Malaysia. Peat burning and emissions from
   the organic layers of drained peat soils, which are not captured by
   bookkeeping methods directly, need to be included to represent the
   substantially larger emissions and interannual variability due to
   synergies of land use and climate variability in Southeast Asia, in
   particular during El Niño events. Similarly to H&N2017, peat burning
   and drainage-related emissions are also added to the BLUE estimate.

   The two bookkeeping estimates used in this study also differ with
   respect to the land-use change data used to drive the models. H&N2017
   base their estimates directly on the Forest Resource Assessment of the
   FAO, which provides statistics on forest area change and management at
   intervals of 5 years currently updated until 2015 (FAO, 2015). The data
   are based on country reporting to the FAO and may include
   remote-sensing information in more recent assessments. Changes in land
   use other than forests are based on annual national changes in cropland
   and pasture areas reported by the FAO (FAOSTAT, 2015). BLUE uses the
   harmonised land-use change data LUH2
   (https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/input4MIPs.1127, Hurtt et al., 2011,
   2018), which describe land-use change, also based on the FAO data, but
   downscaled at a quarter-degree spatial resolution, considering
   sub-grid-scale transitions among primary forest, secondary forest,
   cropland, pasture, and rangeland. The LUH2 data provide a new
   distinction between rangelands and pasture. To constrain the models'
   interpretation on whether rangeland implies the original natural
   vegetation to be transformed to grassland or not (e.g. browsing on
   shrubland), a new forest mask was provided with LUH2; forest is assumed
   to be transformed, while all other natural vegetation remains. This is
   implemented in BLUE.

   The estimate of H&N2017 was extended here by 2 years (to 2017) by
   adding the anomaly of total tropical emissions (peat drainage from
   Hooijer et al. (2010), peat burning, and tropical deforestation and
   degradation fires (from GFED4s) over the previous decade (2006–2015) to
   the decadal average of the bookkeeping result.

2.3.2 Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs)

   Land-use change CO[2] emissions have also been estimated using an
   ensemble of 16 DGVM simulations. The DGVMs account for deforestation
   and regrowth, the most important components of E[LUC], but they do not
   represent all processes resulting directly from human activities on
   land (Table A1). All DGVMs represent processes of vegetation growth and
   mortality, as well as decomposition of dead organic matter associated
   with natural cycles, and include the vegetation and soil carbon
   response to increasing atmospheric CO[2] levels and to climate
   variability and change. Some models explicitly simulate the coupling of
   carbon and nitrogen cycles and account for atmospheric N deposition
   (Table A1). The DGVMs are independent from the other budget terms
   except for their use of atmospheric CO[2] concentration to calculate
   the fertilisation effect of CO[2] on plant photosynthesis.

   The DGVMs used the HYDE land-use change data set (Klein Goldewijk et
   al., 2017a, b), which provides annual half-degree fractional data on
   cropland and pasture. These data are based on annual FAO statistics of
   change in agricultural land area available until 2012. The FAOSTAT land
   use database is updated annually, currently covering the period of
   1961–2016 (but used here until 2015 because of the timing of data
   availability). HYDE-applied annual changes in FAO data to the year 2012
   from the previous release are used to derive new 2013–2015 data. After
   the year 2015 HYDE extrapolates cropland, pasture, and urban land use
   data until the year 2018. Some models also use an update of the more
   comprehensive harmonised land-use data set (Hurtt et al., 2011), which
   further includes fractional data on primary and secondary forest
   vegetation, as well as all underlying transitions between land-use
   states (Hurtt et al., 2018; Table A1). This new data set is of
   quarter-degree fractional areas of land use states and all transitions
   between those states, including a new wood harvest reconstruction, new
   representation of shifting cultivation, crop rotations, and management
   information including irrigation and fertiliser application. The
   land-use states now include five different crop types in addition to
   the pasture–rangeland split discussed before. Wood harvest patterns are
   constrained with Landsat tree cover loss data.

   DGVMs implement land-use change differently (e.g. an increased cropland
   fraction in a grid cell can be at the expense of either grassland or
   shrubs, or forest, the latter resulting in deforestation; land cover
   fractions of the non-agricultural land differ among models). Similarly,
   model-specific assumptions are applied to convert deforested biomass or
   deforested area and other forest product pools into carbon, and
   different choices are made regarding the allocation of rangelands as
   natural vegetation or pastures.

   The DGVM model runs were forced by either the merged monthly CRU and
   6-hourly JRA-55 data set or by the monthly CRU data set, both providing
   observation-based temperature, precipitation, and incoming surface
   radiation on a

   grid and updated to 2017 (Harris et al., 2014). The combination of CRU
   monthly data with 6-hourly forcing is updated this year from NCEP to
   JRA-55 (Kobayashi et al., 2015), adapting the methodology used in
   previous years (Viovy, 2016) to the specifics of the JRA-55 data. The
   forcing data also include global atmospheric CO[2], which changes over
   time (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2018) and gridded time-dependent N
   deposition (as used in some models; Table A1).

   Two sets of simulations were performed with the DGVMs. Both applied
   historical changes in climate, atmospheric CO[2] concentration, and N
   deposition. The two sets of simulations differ, however, with respect
   to land use: one set applies historical changes in land use, the other
   a time-invariant pre-industrial land cover distribution and
   pre-industrial wood harvest rates. By difference of the two
   simulations, the dynamic evolution of vegetation biomass and soil
   carbon pools in response to land use change can be quantified in each
   model (E[LUC]). We only retain model outputs with positive E[LUC], i.e.
   a positive flux to the atmosphere, during the 1990s (Table A1). Using
   the difference between these two DGVM simulations to diagnose E[LUC]
   means the DGVMs account for the loss of additional sink capacity
   (around 0.3 GtC yr^−1; see Sect. 2.8.4), while the bookkeeping models
   do not.

2.3.3 Uncertainty assessment for E[LUC]

   Differences between the bookkeeping models and DGVM models originate
   from three main sources: the different methodologies, the underlying
   land use/land cover data set, and the different processes represented
   (Table A1). We examine the results from the DGVM models and from the
   bookkeeping method and use the resulting variations as a way to
   characterise the uncertainty in E[LUC].

   residuals with results from the DGVMs and inverse estimates for
   different periods, the last decade, and the last year available. All
   values are in GtC yr^−1. The DGVM uncertainties represent ±1σ of the
   decadal or annual (for 2017 only) estimates from the individual DGVMs:

   Two additional inversions are available from 2001 and used from the
   decade of the 2000s (Table A3).

   The E[LUC] estimate from the DGVMs multi-model mean is consistent with
   the average of the emissions from the bookkeeping models (Table 5).
   However there are large differences among individual DGVMs (standard
   deviation at around 0.6–0.7 GtC yr^−1; Table 5), between the two
   bookkeeping models (average of 0.7 GtC yr^−1), and between the current
   estimate of H&N2017 and its previous model version (Houghton et al.,
   2012). The uncertainty in E[LUC] of ±0.7 GtC yr^−1 reflects our best
   value judgment that there is at least a 68 % chance (±1σ) that the true
   land-use change emission lies within the given range, for the range of
   processes considered here. Prior to the year 1959, the uncertainty in
   E[LUC] was taken from the standard deviation of the DGVMs. We assign
   low confidence to the annual estimates of E[LUC] because of the
   inconsistencies among estimates and of the difficulties to quantify
   some of the processes in DGVMs.

2.3.4 Emission projections

   We project emissions for both H&N2017 and BLUE for 2018 using the same
   approach as for the extrapolation of H&N2017 for 2016–2017. Peat
   burning as well as tropical deforestation and degradation are estimated
   using active fire data (MCD14ML; Giglio et al., 2016), which scales
   almost linearly with GFED (van der Werf et al., 2017) and thus allows
   for tracking fire emissions in deforestation and tropical peat zones in
   near-real time. During most years, emissions during January–October
   cover most of the fire season in the Amazon and Southeast Asia, where a
   large part of the global deforestation takes place.

2.4 Growth rate in atmospheric CO[2] concentration (G[ATM])

2.4.1 Global growth rate in atmospheric CO[2] concentration

   The rate of growth of the atmospheric CO[2] concentration is provided
   by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System
   Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL, 2018; Dlugokencky and Tans, 2018),
   which is updated from Ballantyne et al. (2012). For the 1959–1979
   period, the global growth rate is based on measurements of atmospheric
   CO[2] concentration averaged from the Mauna Loa and South Pole
   stations, as observed by the CO[2] Program at the Scripps Institution
   of Oceanography (Keeling et al., 1976). For the 1980–2017 time period,
   the global growth rate is based on the average of multiple stations
   selected from the marine boundary layer sites with well-mixed
   background air (Ballantyne et al., 2012), after fitting each station
   with a smoothed curve as a function of time and averaging by latitude
   band (Masarie and Tans, 1995). The annual growth rate is estimated by
   Dlugokencky and Tans (2018) from the atmospheric CO[2] concentration by
   taking the average of the most recent December–January months corrected
   for the average seasonal cycle and subtracting this same average 1 year
   earlier. The growth rate in units of ppm yr^−1 is converted to units of
   GtC yr^−1 by multiplying by a factor of 2.124 GtC per ppm (Ballantyne
   et al., 2012).

   The uncertainty around the atmospheric growth rate is due to four main
   factors. The first factor is the long-term reproducibility of reference
   gas standards (around 0.03 ppm for 1σ from the 1980s). The second
   factor is that small unexplained systematic analytical errors that may
   have a duration of several months to 2 years come and go. They have
   been simulated by randomising both the duration and the magnitude
   (determined from the existing evidence) in a Monte Carlo procedure. The
   third factor is the network composition of the marine boundary layer
   with some sites coming or going, gaps in the time series at each site,
   etc. (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2018). The latter uncertainty was estimated
   by NOAA/ESRL with a Monte Carlo method by constructing 100
   “alternative” networks (NOAA/ESRL, 2018; Masarie and Tans, 1995). The
   second and third uncertainties, summed in quadrature, add up to
   0.085 ppm on average (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2018). Fourth, the
   uncertainty associated with using the average CO[2] concentration from
   a surface network to approximate the true atmospheric average CO[2]
   concentration (mass weighted, in three dimensions) as needed to assess
   the total atmospheric CO[2] burden. In reality, CO[2] variations
   measured at the stations will not exactly track changes in total
   atmospheric burden, with offsets in magnitude and phasing due to
   vertical and horizontal mixing. This effect must be very small on
   decadal and longer timescales, when the atmosphere can be considered
   well mixed. Preliminary estimates suggest this effect would increase
   the annual uncertainty, but a full analysis is not yet available. We
   therefore maintain an uncertainty around the annual growth rate based
   on the multiple stations' data set ranges between 0.11 and
   0.72 GtC yr^−1, with a mean of 0.61 GtC yr^−1 for 1959–1979 and
   0.18 GtC yr^−1 for 1980–2017, when a larger set of stations were
   available as provided by Dlugokencky and Tans (2018), but recognise
   further exploration of this uncertainty is required. At this time, we
   estimate the uncertainty of the decadal averaged growth rate after 1980
   at 0.02 GtC yr^−1 based on the calibration and the annual growth rate
   uncertainty, but stretched over a 10-year interval. For years prior to
   1980, we estimate the decadal averaged uncertainty to be 0.07 GtC yr^−1
   based on a factor proportional to the annual uncertainty prior to and
   after 1980 (
   [MATH: <mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">0.61</mn><mo>/</mo><mn
   mathvariant="normal">0.18</mn><mo>×</mo><mn
   mathvariant="normal">0.02</mn></mrow> :MATH]
    GtC yr^−1).

   We assign a high confidence to the annual estimates of G[ATM] because
   they are based on direct measurements from multiple and consistent
   instruments and stations distributed around the world (Ballantyne et
   al., 2012).

   In order to estimate the total carbon accumulated in the atmosphere
   since 1750 or 1870, we use an atmospheric CO[2] concentration of
   277±3 ppm or 288±3 ppm, respectively, based on a cubic spline fit to
   ice core data (Joos and Spahni, 2008). The uncertainty of ±3 ppm
   (converted to ±1σ) is taken directly from the IPCC's assessment (Ciais
   et al., 2013). Typical uncertainties in the growth rate in atmospheric
   CO[2] concentration from ice core data are equivalent to
   ±0.1–0.15 GtC yr^−1 as evaluated from the Law Dome data (Etheridge et
   al., 1996) for individual 20-year intervals over the period from 1870
   to 1960 (Bruno and Joos, 1997).

2.4.2 Atmospheric growth rate projection

   We provide an assessment of G[ATM] for 2018 based on the observed
   increase in atmospheric CO[2] concentration at the Mauna Loa station
   for January to October and a mean growth rate over the past 5 years for
   the months November to December. Growth at Mauna Loa is closely
   correlated with the global growth (r=0.95) and is used here as a proxy
   for global growth, but the regression is not 1 to 1. We also adjust the
   projected global growth rate to take this into account. The assessment
   method used this year differs from the forecast method used in Le Quéré
   et al. (2018) based on the relationship between annual CO[2] growth
   rate and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Niño3.4 region of Betts
   et al. (2016). A change was introduced because although the observed
   growth rate for 2017 of 2.2 ppm was within the projection range of
   2.5±0.5 ppm of last year ( Le Quéré et al., 2018), the forecast values
   for 2018 for January to October are too high by approximately 0.4 ppm
   above observed values on average. The reasons for the difference are
   being investigated. The use of observed growth at Mauna Loa
   Observatory, Hawaii, for the first half of the year is thought to be
   more robust because of its high correlation with the global growth
   rate. Furthermore, additional analysis suggests that the first half of
   the year shows more interannual variability than the second half of the
   year, so that the exact projection method applied to November–December
   has only a small impact (<0.1 ppm) on the projection of the full year.
   Uncertainty is estimated from past variability using the standard
   deviation of the last 5 years' monthly growth rates.

2.5 Ocean CO[2] sink

   Estimates of the global ocean CO[2] sink S[OCEAN] are from an ensemble
   of global ocean biogeochemistry models (GOBMs) that meet observational
   constraints over the 1990s (see below). We use observation-based
   estimates of S[OCEAN] to provide a qualitative assessment of confidence
   in the reported results and to estimate the cumulative accumulation of
   S[OCEAN] over the pre-industrial period.

2.5.1 Observation-based estimates

   We use the observational constraints assessed by IPCC of a mean ocean
   CO[2] sink of 2.2±0.4 GtC yr^−1 for the 1990s (Denman et al., 2007) to
   verify that the GOBMs provide a realistic assessment of S[OCEAN]. This
   is based on indirect observations with seven different methodologies
   and their uncertainties, using the methods that are deemed most
   reliable for the assessment of this quantity (Denman et al., 2007). The
   IPCC confirmed this assessment in 2013 (Ciais et al., 2013). The
   observational-based estimates use the ocean–land CO[2] sink
   partitioning from observed atmospheric O[2]∕N[2] concentration trends
   (Manning and Keeling, 2006; updated in Keeling and Manning 2014), an
   oceanic inversion method constrained by ocean biogeochemistry data
   (Mikaloff Fletcher et al., 2006), and a method based on a penetration
   timescale for chlorofluorocarbons (McNeil et al., 2003). The IPCC
   estimate of 2.2 GtC yr^−1 for the 1990s is consistent with a range of
   methods (Wanninkhof et al., 2013).

   We also use two estimates of the ocean CO[2] sink and its variability
   based on interpolations of measurements of surface ocean fugacity of
   CO[2] (pCO[2] corrected for the non-ideal behaviour of the gas; Pfeil
   et al., 2013). We refer to these as pCO[2]-based flux estimates. The
   measurements are from the Surface Ocean CO[2] Atlas version 6, which is
   an update of version 3 (Bakker et al., 2016) and contains
   quality-controlled data until 2017 (see data attribution Table A4). The
   SOCAT v6 data were mapped using a data-driven diagnostic method
   (Rödenbeck et al., 2013) and a combined self-organising map and
   feed-forward neural network (Landschützer et al., 2014). The global
   pCO[2]-based flux estimates were adjusted to remove the pre-industrial
   ocean source of CO[2] to the atmosphere of 0.78 GtC yr^−1 from river
   input to the ocean (Resplandy et al., 2018), per our definition of
   S[OCEAN]. Several other ocean sink products based on observations are
   also available but they continue to show large unresolved discrepancies
   with observed variability. Here we used the two pCO[2]-based flux
   products that had the best fit to observations for their representation
   of tropical and global variability (Rödenbeck et al., 2015).

   We further use results from two diagnostic ocean models of Khatiwala et
   al. (2013) and DeVries (2014) to estimate the anthropogenic carbon
   accumulated in the ocean prior to 1959. The two approaches assume
   constant ocean circulation and biological fluxes, with S[OCEAN]
   estimated as a response in the change in atmospheric CO[2]
   concentration calibrated to observations. The uncertainty in cumulative
   uptake of ±20 GtC (converted to ±1σ) is taken directly from the IPCC's
   review of the literature (Rhein et al., 2013), or about ±30 % for the
   annual values (Khatiwala et al., 2009).

2.5.2 Global ocean biogeochemistry models (GOBMs)

   The ocean CO[2] sink for 1959–2017 is estimated using seven GOBMs
   (Table A2). The GOBMs represent the physical, chemical, and biological
   processes that influence the surface ocean concentration of CO[2] and
   thus the air–sea CO[2] flux. The GOBMs are forced by meteorological
   reanalysis and atmospheric CO[2] concentration data available for the
   entire time period. They mostly differ in the source of the atmospheric
   forcing data (meteorological reanalysis), spin-up strategies, and their
   horizontal and vertical resolutions (Table A2). GOBMs do not include
   the effects of anthropogenic changes in nutrient supply, which could
   lead to an increase in the ocean sink of up to about 0.3 GtC yr^−1 over
   the industrial period (Duce et al., 2008). They also do not include the
   perturbation associated with changes in riverine organic carbon (see
   Sect. 2.8.3).

2.5.3 GOBM evaluation and uncertainty assessment for S[OCEAN]

   The mean ocean CO[2] sink for all GOBMs falls within 90 % confidence of
   the observed range, or 1.6 to 2.8 GtC yr^−1 for the 1990s. Here we have
   adjusted the confidence interval to the IPCC confidence interval of
   90 % to avoid rejecting models that may be outliers but are still
   plausible.

   The GOBMs and flux products have been further evaluated using fCO[2]
   from the SOCAT v6 database. We focused this initial evaluation on the
   interannual mismatch metric proposed by Rödenbeck et al. (2015) for the
   comparison of flux products. The metric provides a measure of the
   mismatch between observations and models or flux products on the x axis
   as well as a measure of the amplitude of the interannual variability on
   the y axis. A smaller number on the x axis indicates a better fit with
   observations. The amplitude of the interannual variability in S[OCEAN]
   (y axis) is calculated as the temporal standard deviation of the CO[2]
   flux time series.

   The calculation for the x axis is carried out as follows: (1) the
   mismatch between the observed and the modelled fCO[2] is calculated for
   the period 1985 to 2017 (except for the IPSL model, which uses 1985 to
   2015 due to data availability), but only for grid points for which
   actual observations exist. (2) The interannual variability in this
   mismatch is calculated as the temporal standard deviation of the
   mismatch. (3) To put numbers into perspective, the interannual
   variability in the mismatch is reported relative to the interannual
   variability in the mismatch between a benchmark fCO[2] field and the
   observations. The benchmark fCO[2] field is designed to have no
   interannual variability, i.e. it is calculated as the mean seasonal
   cycle at each grid point over the full period plus the deseasonalised
   atmospheric fCO[2] increase over time. By definition, the interannual
   variability in the misfit between benchmark and observations is large
   as the benchmark field does not contain any interannual variability
   from the ocean. A smaller relative interannual variability mismatch
   indicates a better fit between observed and modelled fCO[2]. This
   metric is chosen because it is the most direct measure of the
   year-to-year variability in S[OCEAN] in ocean biogeochemistry models.
   We apply the metric globally and by latitude bands. Results are shown
   in Fig. B1 and discussed in Sect. 3.1.3.

   The uncertainty around the mean ocean sink of anthropogenic CO[2] was
   quantified by Denman et al. (2007) for the 1990s (see Sect. 2.5.1). To
   quantify the uncertainty around annual values, we examine the standard
   deviation of the GOBM ensemble, which averages between 0.2 and
   0.3 GtC yr^−1 during 1959–2017. We estimate that the uncertainty in the
   annual ocean CO[2] sink is about ±0.5 GtC yr^−1 from the combined
   uncertainty of the mean flux based on observations of ±0.4 GtC yr^−1
   and the standard deviation across GOBMs of up to ±0.3 GtC yr^−1,
   reflecting the uncertainty in both the mean sink from observations
   during the 1990s (Denman et al., 2007; Sect. 2.5.1) and the interannual
   variability as assessed by GOBMs.

   We examine the consistency between the variability in the model-based
   and the pCO[2]-based flux products to assess confidence in S[OCEAN].
   The interannual variability in the ocean fluxes (quantified as the
   standard deviation) of the two pCO[2]-based flux products for 1985–2017
   (where they overlap) is ±0.36 GtC yr^−1 (Rödenbeck et al., 2014) and
   ±0.38 GtC yr^−1 (Landschützer et al., 2015), compared to
   ±0.29 GtC yr^−1 for the GOBM ensemble. The standard deviation includes
   a component of trend and decadal variability in addition to interannual
   variability, and their relative influence differs across estimates.
   Individual estimates (both GOBM and flux products) generally produce a
   higher ocean CO[2] sink during strong El Niño events. The annual
   pCO[2]-based flux products correlate with the ocean CO[2] sink
   estimated here with a correlation of r=0.75 (0.59 to 0.79 for
   individual GOBMs) and r=0.80 (0.71 to 0.81) for the pCO[2]-based flux
   products of Rödenbeck et al. (2014) and Landschützer et al. (2015),
   respectively (simple linear regression), with their mutual correlation
   at 0.73. The agreement between models and the flux products reflects
   some consistency in their representation of underlying variability
   since there is little overlap in their methodology or use of
   observations. The use of annual data for the correlation may reduce the
   strength of the relationship because the dominant source of variability
   associated with El Niño events is less than 1 year. We assess a medium
   confidence level to the annual ocean CO[2] sink and its uncertainty
   because it is based on multiple lines of evidence, and the results are
   consistent in that the interannual variability in the GOBMs and
   data-based estimates are all generally small compared to the
   variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO[2] concentration.

2.6 Terrestrial CO[2] sink

2.6.1 DGVM simulations

   The terrestrial land sink (S[LAND]) is thought to be due to the
   combined effects of fertilisation by rising atmospheric CO[2] and N
   deposition on plant growth, as well as the effects of climate change
   such as the lengthening of the growing season in northern temperate and
   boreal areas. S[LAND] does not include land sinks directly resulting
   from land use and land-use change (e.g. regrowth of vegetation) as
   these are part of the land use flux (E[LUC]), although system
   boundaries make it difficult to exactly attribute CO[2] fluxes on land
   between S[LAND] and E[LUC] (Erb et al., 2013).

   S[LAND] is estimated from the multi-model mean of the DGVMs (Table 4).
   As described in Sect. 2.3.2, DGVM simulations include all climate
   variability and CO[2] effects over land, with some DGVMs also including
   the effect of N deposition. The DGVMs do not include the perturbation
   associated with changes in river organic carbon, which is discussed in
   Sect. 2.8.

2.6.2 DGVM evaluation and uncertainty assessment for S[LAND]

   We apply three criteria for minimum DGVM realism by including only
   those DGVMs with (1) steady state after spin-up; (2) net land fluxes
   (S[LAND]–E[LUC]) that are the atmosphere-to-land carbon flux over the
   1990s ranging between −0.3 and 2.3 GtC yr^−1, within 90 % confidence of
   constraints by global atmospheric and oceanic observations (Keeling and
   Manning, 2014; Wanninkhof et al., 2013); and (3) global E[LUC] that is
   a carbon source to the atmosphere over the 1990s. All 16 DGVMs meet the
   three criteria.

   In addition, the DGVM results are now also evaluated using the
   International Land Model Benchmarking System (ILAMB; Collier et al.,
   2018). This evaluation is provided here to document, encourage, and
   support model improvements through time. ILAMB variables cover key
   processes that are relevant for the quantification of S[LAND] and
   resulting aggregated outcomes. The selected variables are vegetation
   biomass, gross primary productivity, leaf area index, net ecosystem
   exchange, ecosystem respiration, evapotranspiration, and runoff (see
   Fig. B2 for the results and for the list of observed databases).
   Results are shown in Fig. B2 and discussed in Sect. 3.1.3.

   For the uncertainty, we use the standard deviation of the annual CO[2]
   sink across the DGVMs, which averages to ±0.8 GtC yr^−1 for the period
   from 1959 to 2017. We attach a medium confidence level to the annual
   land CO[2] sink and its uncertainty because the estimates from the
   residual budget and averaged DGVMs match well within their respective
   uncertainties (Table 5).

2.7 The atmospheric perspective

   The worldwide network of atmospheric measurements can be used with
   atmospheric inversion methods to constrain the location of the combined
   total surface CO[2] fluxes from all sources, including fossil and
   land-use change emissions and land and ocean CO[2] fluxes. The
   inversions assume E[FF] to be well known, and they solve for the
   spatial and temporal distribution of land and ocean fluxes from the
   residual gradients of CO[2] among stations that are not explained by
   fossil fuel emissions.

   Four atmospheric inversions (Table A3) used atmospheric CO[2] data
   until the end of 2017 (including preliminary values in some cases) to
   infer the spatio-temporal distribution of the CO[2] flux exchanged
   between the atmosphere and the land or oceans. We focus here on the
   largest and most consistent sources of information, namely the total
   land and ocean CO[2] fluxes and their partitioning among the mid- to
   high-latitude region of the Northern Hemisphere (30–90^∘ N), the
   tropics (30^∘ S–30^∘ N), and the mid- to high-latitude region of the
   Southern Hemisphere (30–90^∘ S). We also break down those estimates for
   the land and ocean regions separately, to further scrutinise the
   constraints from atmospheric observations. We use these estimates to
   comment on the consistency across various data streams and
   process-based estimates.

2.7.1 Atmospheric inversions

   The four inversion systems used in this release are CarbonTracker
   Europe (CTE; van der Laan-Luijkx et al., 2017), Jena CarboScope
   (Rödenbeck, 2005), the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS;
   Chevallier et al., 2005), and MIROC (Patra et al., 2018). See Table A3
   for version numbers. The inversions are based on the same Bayesian
   inversion principles that interpret the same, for the most part,
   observed time series (or subsets thereof) but use different
   methodologies (Table A3). These differences mainly concern the
   selection of atmospheric CO[2] data, the used prior fluxes, spatial
   breakdown (i.e. grid size), assumed correlation structures, and
   mathematical approach. The details of these approaches are documented
   extensively in the references provided above. Each system uses a
   different transport model, which was demonstrated to be a driving
   factor behind differences in atmospheric-based flux estimates, and
   specifically their distribution across latitudinal bands (e.g. Gaubert
   et al., 2018).

   The inversions use atmospheric CO[2] observations from various flask
   and in situ networks, as detailed in Table A3. They prescribe global
   E[FF], which is scaled to the present study for CAMS and CTE, while
   slightly lower E[FF] values based on alternative emission compilations
   were used in CarboScope and MIROC. Since this is known to result
   directly in lower total CO[2] uptake in atmospheric inversions (Gaubert
   et al., 2018; Peylin et al., 2013), we adjusted the land sink of each
   inversion estimate (where most of the emissions occur) by its fossil
   fuel difference to the CAMS model. These differences amount to as much
   as 0.7 GtC for certain years (CarboScope inversion region NH) and are
   thus an important consideration in an inverse flux comparison.

   The land–ocean CO[2] fluxes from atmospheric inversions contain
   anthropogenic perturbation and natural pre-industrial CO[2] fluxes.
   Natural pre-industrial fluxes are land CO[2] sinks corresponding to
   carbon transported to the ocean by rivers. These land CO[2] sinks are
   compensated for over the globe by ocean CO[2] sources corresponding to
   the outgassing of riverine carbon inputs to the ocean. We apply the
   distribution of land CO[2] fluxes in three latitude bands using
   estimates from Resplandy et al. (2018), which are constrained by ocean
   heat transport to a total sink of 0.78 GtC yr^−1. The latitude
   distribution of river-induced ocean CO[2] sources is derived from a
   simulation of the IPSL GOBM using the river flux constrained by heat
   transport of Resplandy et al. (2018) as an input. We adjusted the
   land–ocean fluxes per latitude band based on these results.

   The atmospheric inversions are now evaluated using vertical profiles of
   atmospheric CO[2] concentrations (Fig. B3). More than 50 aircraft
   programmes over the globe, either regular or occasional, have been used
   in order to draw a picture of the model performance but the space–time
   data coverage is irregular, denser around 2009 or in the 0–45^∘ N
   latitude band. The four models are compared to independent CO[2]
   measurements made onboard aircraft over many places of the world
   between 1 and 7 km above sea level, between 2008 and 2016. Results are
   shown in Fig. B3 and discussed in Sect. 3.1.3.

2.8 Processes not included in the global carbon budget

   The contribution of anthropogenic CO and CH[4] to the global carbon
   budget has been partly neglected in Eq. (1) and is described in
   Sect. 2.8.1. The contributions of other carbonates to CO[2] emissions
   are described in Sect. 2.8.2. The contribution of anthropogenic changes
   in river fluxes is conceptually included in Eq. (1) in S[OCEAN] and in
   S[LAND], but it is not represented in the process models used to
   quantify these fluxes. This effect is discussed in Sect. 2.8.3.
   Similarly, the loss of additional sink capacity from reduced forest
   cover is missing in the combination of approaches used here to estimate
   both land fluxes (E[LUC] and S[LAND]) and its potential effect is
   discussed and quantified in Sect. 2.8.4.

2.8.1 Contribution of anthropogenic CO and CH[4] to the global carbon budget

   Equation (1) only partly includes the net input of CO[2] to the
   atmosphere from the chemical oxidation of reactive carbon-containing
   gases from sources other than the combustion of fossil fuels, such as
   (1) cement process emissions, since these do not come from combustion
   of fossil fuels, (2) the oxidation of fossil fuels, and (3) the
   assumption of immediate oxidation of vented methane in oil production.
   Equation (1) omits however any other anthropogenic carbon-containing
   gases that are eventually oxidised in the atmosphere, such as
   anthropogenic emissions of CO and CH[4]. An attempt is made in this
   section to estimate their magnitude and identify the sources of
   uncertainty. Anthropogenic CO emissions are from incomplete fossil fuel
   and biofuel burning and deforestation fires. The main anthropogenic
   emissions of fossil CH[4] that matter for the global carbon budget are
   the fugitive emissions of coal, oil, and gas upstream from sectors (see
   below). These emissions of CO and CH[4] contribute a net addition of
   fossil carbon to the atmosphere. In our estimate of E[FF] we assumed
   (Sect. 2.1.1) that all the fuel burned is emitted as CO[2]; thus CO
   anthropogenic emissions associated with incomplete combustion and their
   atmospheric oxidation into CO[2] within a few months are already
   counted implicitly in E[FF] and should not be counted twice (same for
   E[LUC] and anthropogenic CO emissions by deforestation fires).
   Anthropogenic emissions of fossil CH[4] are not included in E[FF]
   because these fugitive emissions are not included in the fuel
   inventories. Yet they contribute to the annual CO[2] growth rate after
   CH[4] is oxidised into CO[2]. Anthropogenic emissions of fossil CH[4]
   represent 15 % of total CH[4] emissions (Kirschke et al., 2013), that
   is 0.061 GtC yr^−1 for the past decade. Assuming steady state, these
   emissions are all converted to CO[2] by OH oxidation and thus explain
   0.06 GtC yr^−1 of the global CO[2] growth rate in the past decade, or
   0.07–0.1 GtC yr^−1 using the higher CH[4] emissions reported recently
   (Schwietzke et al., 2016).

   global carbon cycle caused by anthropogenic activities, averaged
   globally for the decade 2008–2017. See legends for the corresponding
   arrows and units. The uncertainty in the atmospheric CO[2] growth rate
   is very small (±0.02 GtC yr^−1) and is neglected for the figure. The
   anthropogenic perturbation occurs on top of an active carbon cycle,
   with fluxes and stocks represented in the background and taken from
   Ciais et al. (2013) for all numbers, with the ocean fluxes updated to
   90 GtC yr^−1 to account for the increase in atmospheric CO[2] since
   publication, and except for the carbon stocks at the coasts, which are
   from a literature review of coastal marine sediments (Price and Warren,
   2016).

   Other anthropogenic changes in the sources of CO and CH[4] from
   wildfires, vegetation biomass, wetlands, ruminants, or permafrost
   changes are similarly assumed to have a small effect on the CO[2]
   growth rate. The CH[4] emissions and sinks are published and analysed
   separately in the Global Methane Budget publication that follows an
   approach similar to that presented here (Saunois et al., 2016).

2.8.2 Contribution of other carbonates to CO[2] emissions

   The contribution of fossil carbonates other than cement production is
   not systematically included in estimates of E[FF], except at the
   national level at which they are accounted for in the UNFCCC national
   inventories. The missing processes include CO[2] emissions associated
   with the calcination of lime and limestone outside cement production
   and the reabsorption of CO[2] by the rocks and concrete from
   carbonation through their lifetime (Xi et al., 2016). Carbonates are
   used in various industries, including in iron and steel manufacture and
   in agriculture. They are found naturally in some coals. Carbonation
   from the cement life cycle, including demolition and crushing, was
   estimated by one study to be around 0.25 GtC yr^−1 for the year 2013
   (Xi et al., 2016). Carbonation emissions from the cement life cycle
   would offset calcination emissions from lime and limestone production.
   The balance of these two processes is not clear.

2.8.3 Anthropogenic carbon fluxes in the land-to-ocean aquatic continuum

   The approach used to determine the global carbon budget refers to the
   mean, variations, and trends in the perturbation of CO[2] in the
   atmosphere, referenced to the pre-industrial era. Carbon is
   continuously displaced from the land to the ocean through the
   land–ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC) comprising freshwaters, estuaries,
   and coastal areas (Bauer et al., 2013; Regnier et al., 2013). A
   significant fraction of this lateral carbon flux is entirely “natural”
   and is thus a steady-state component of the pre-industrial carbon
   cycle. We account for this pre-industrial flux where appropriate in our
   study. However, changes in environmental conditions and land use change
   have caused an increase in the lateral transport of carbon into the
   LOAC – a perturbation that is relevant for the global carbon budget
   presented here.

   The results of the analysis of Regnier et al. (2013) can be summarised
   in two points of relevance for the anthropogenic CO[2] budget. First,
   the anthropogenic perturbation has increased the organic carbon export
   from terrestrial ecosystems to the hydrosphere at a rate of
   1.0±0.5 GtC yr^−1, mainly owing to enhanced carbon export from soils.
   Second, this exported anthropogenic carbon is partly respired through
   the LOAC, partly sequestered in sediments along the LOAC, and to a
   lesser extent transferred to the open ocean where it may accumulate.
   The increase in storage of land-derived organic carbon in the LOAC and
   open ocean combined is estimated by Regnier et al. (2013) at
   0.65±0.35 GtC yr^−1. We do not attempt to incorporate the changes in
   LOAC in our study.

   The inclusion of freshwater fluxes of anthropogenic CO[2] affects the
   estimates of, and partitioning between, S[LAND] and S[OCEAN] in
   Eq. (1), but does not affect the other terms. This effect is not
   included in the GOBMs and DGVMs used in our global carbon budget
   analysis presented here.

2.8.4 Loss of additional sink capacity

   Historical land-cover change was dominated by transitions from
   vegetation types that can provide a large sink per area unit (typically
   forests) to others less efficient in removing CO[2] from the atmosphere
   (typically croplands). The resultant decrease in land sink, called the
   “loss of sink capacity”, is calculated as the difference between the
   actual land sink under changing land cover and the counterfactual land
   sink under pre-industrial land cover. An efficient protocol has yet to
   be designed to estimate the magnitude of the loss of additional sink
   capacity in DGVMs. Here, we provide a quantitative estimate of this
   term to be used in the discussion. Our estimate uses the compact Earth
   system model OSCAR whose land carbon cycle component is designed to
   emulate the behaviour of DGVMs (Gasser et al., 2017). We use OSCAR
   v2.2.1 (an update of v2.2 with minor changes) in a probabilistic setup
   identical to the one of Arneth et al. (2017) but with a Monte Carlo
   ensemble of 2000 simulations. For each, we calculate S[LAND] and the
   loss of additional sink capacity separately. We then constrain the
   ensemble by weighting each member to obtain a distribution of
   cumulative S[LAND] over 1850–2005 close to the DGVMs used here. From
   this ensemble, we estimate a loss of additional sink capacity of
   0.4±0.3 GtC yr^−1 on average over 2005–2014 and 20±15 GtC accumulated
   between 1870 and 2017 (using a linear extrapolation of the trend to
   estimate the last few years).

3.1 Global carbon budget mean and variability for 1959–2017

   The global carbon budget averaged over the last half-century is shown
   in Fig. 3. For this time period, 82 % of the total emissions
   (E[FF]+E[LUC]) were caused by fossil CO[2] emissions and 18 % by
   land-use change. The total emissions were partitioned among the
   atmosphere (45 %), ocean (24 %), and land (30 %). All components except
   land-use change emissions have grown since 1959, with important
   interannual variability in the growth rate in atmospheric CO[2]
   concentration and in the land CO[2] sink (Fig. 4) and some decadal
   variability in all terms (Table 6). Differences with previous budget
   releases are documented in Fig. B4.

   Fig. 2 as a function of time, for fossil CO[2] emissions (E[FF]; grey)
   and emissions from land-use change (E[LUC]; brown), as well as their
   partitioning among the atmosphere (G[ATM]; blue), ocean (S[OCEAN];
   turquoise), and land (S[LAND]; green). The partitioning is based on
   nearly independent estimates from observations (for G[ATM]) and from
   process model ensembles constrained by data (for S[OCEAN] and S[LAND])
   and does not exactly add up to the sum of the emissions, resulting in a
   budget imbalance, which is represented by the difference between the
   bottom pink line (reflecting total emissions) and the sum of the ocean,
   land, and atmosphere. All time series are in GtC yr^−1. G[ATM] and
   S[OCEAN] prior to 1959 are based on different methods. E[FF] values are
   primarily from Boden et al. (2017), with uncertainty of about ±5 %
   (±1σ); E[LUC] values are from two bookkeeping models (Table 2) with
   uncertainties of about ±50 %; G[ATM] prior to 1959 is from Joos and
   Spahni (2008) with uncertainties equivalent to about
   ±0.1–0.15 GtC yr^−1 and from Dlugokencky and Tans (2018) from 1959 with
   uncertainties of about ±0.2 GtC yr^−1; S[OCEAN] prior to 1959 is
   averaged from Khatiwala et al. (2013) and DeVries (2014) with
   uncertainty of about ±30 % and from a multi-model mean (Table 4) from
   1959 with uncertainties of about ±0.5 GtC yr^−1; S[LAND] is a
   multi-model mean (Table 4) with uncertainties of about ±0.9 GtC yr^−1.

3.1.1 CO[2] emissions

   Global fossil CO[2] emissions have increased every decade from an
   average of 3.1±0.2 GtC yr^−1 in the 1960s to an average of
   9.4±0.5 GtC yr^−1 during 2008–2017 (Table 6, Figs. 2 and 5). The growth
   rate in these emissions decreased between the 1960s and the 1990s, from
   4.5 % yr^−1 in the 1960s (1960–1969) to 2.8 % yr^−1 in the 1970s
   (1970–1979), 1.9 % yr^−1 in the 1980s (1980–1989), and 1.0 % yr^−1 in
   the 1990s (1990–1999). After this period, the growth rate began
   increasing again in the 2000s at an average growth rate of 3.2 % yr^−1,
   decreasing to 1.5 % yr^−1 for the last decade (2008–2017), with a
   3-year period of no or low growth during 2014–2016 (Fig. 5).

   In contrast, CO[2] emissions from land use, land-use change, and
   forestry have remained relatively constant, at around 1.3±0.7 GtC yr^−1
   over the past half-century but with large spread across estimates
   (Fig. 6). These emissions are also relatively constant in the DGVM
   ensemble of models, except during the last decade when they increase to
   1.9±0.6 GtC yr^−1. However, there is no agreement on this recent
   increase between the two bookkeeping models, each suggesting an

3.1.2 Partitioning among the atmosphere, ocean, and land

   The growth rate in atmospheric CO[2] level increased from
   1.7±0.07 GtC yr^−1 in the 1960s to 4.7±0.02 GtC yr^−1 during 2008–2017
   with important decadal variations (Table 6 and Fig. 2). Both ocean and
   land CO[2] sinks increased roughly in line with the atmospheric
   increase, but with significant decadal variability on land (Table 6),
   and possibly in the ocean (Fig. 7).

   The ocean CO[2] sink increased from 1.0±0.5 GtC yr^−1 in the 1960s to
   2.4±0.5 GtC yr^−1 during 2008–2017, with interannual variations of the
   order of a few tenths of GtC yr^−1 generally showing an increased ocean
   sink during large El Niño events (i.e. 1997–1998) (Fig. 7; Rödenbeck et
   al., 2014). Although there is some coherence among the GOBMs and
   pCO[2]-based flux products regarding the mean, there is poor agreement
   for interannual variability, and the ocean models underestimate decadal
   variability (Sect. 2.5.3 and Fig. 7; DeVries et al., 2017).

   flux products were adjusted for the pre-industrial ocean source of
   CO[2]from river input to the ocean, which is not present in the ocean
   models, by adding a sink of 0.78 GtC yr^−1 (Resplandy et al., 2018), to
   make them comparable to S[OCEAN]. This adjustment does not take into
   account the anthropogenic contribution to river fluxes (see
   Sect. 2.8.3).

   The terrestrial CO[2] sink increased from 1.2±0.5 GtC yr^−1 in the
   1960s to 3.2±0.7 GtC yr^−1 during 2008–2017, with important interannual
   variations of up to 2 GtC yr^−1 generally showing a decreased land sink
   during El Niño events (Fig. 6), responsible for the corresponding
   enhanced growth rate in atmospheric CO[2] concentration. The larger
   land CO[2] sink during 2008–2017 compared to the 1960s is reproduced by
   all the DGVMs in response to the combined atmospheric CO[2] increase
   and changes in climate, and consistent with constraints from the other
   budget terms (Table 5).

   Estimates of total atmosphere-to-land fluxes (S[LAND]–E[LUC]) from the
   DGVMs are consistent with the budget constraints (Table 5), except
   during 2008–2017, when the DGVM ensemble estimates a total
   atmosphere-to-land flux of 1.3±0.5 GtC yr^−1, likely below the budget
   constraints of 2.1±0.7 GtC yr^−1 and outside the range of the
   inversions (Table 5). This comparison suggests that the DGVMs could
   overestimate E[LUC] emissions and/or underestimate the terrestrial sink
   S[LAND] during the last decade.

3.1.3 Model evaluation

   The evaluation of ocean estimates (Fig. B1) shows a relative
   interannual mismatch of 15 % and 17 % for the two pCO[2]-based flux
   products over the globe, relative to the pCO[2] observations from the
   SOCAT v6 database for the period 1985–2017. A 0 % mismatch would
   indicate a perfect model, and a field with no interannual variability
   would result in a 100 % mismatch. A mismatch larger than 100 % is
   possible when the method produces a larger mismatch than the benchmark
   field with no interannual variability (see Sect. 2.5.3). This mismatch
   by the pCO[2]-based flux products is improved compared with earlier
   published versions of these two flux products of around 20 %–25 % for
   the 1992–2009 time period (Rödenbeck et al., 2015), likely because of
   the larger data availability after 2009. The GOBMs show a global
   relative interannual mismatch between 50 % and 60 %, with one model at
   94 % and one at 193 %. The GOBM mismatch is of the same order as the
   mismatch calculated in an ensemble of 14 flux products but larger than
   the two flux products used in this report (Fig. 5 in Rödenbeck et al.,
   2015). The mismatch is generally larger at high latitudes compared to
   the tropics, for both the flux products and the GOBMs. The two flux
   products have a similar mismatch of around 10 %–15 % in the tropics,
   around 25 % in the north, and 30 %–55 % in the south. The GOBM mismatch
   is more spread across regions, ranging from 29 % to 178 % in the
   tropics, 70 % to 192 % in the north, and 108 % to 304 % in the south.
   The higher mismatch occurs in regions with stronger climate
   variability, such as the northern and southern high latitudes (poleward
   of the subtropical gyres) and the equatorial Pacific. The latter is
   also apparent in the model mismatch but is hidden in Fig. B1 due to the
   averaging over 30^∘ S to 30^∘ N (see also Sect. 4).

   The evaluation of the DGVMs (Fig. B2) shows generally high skill scores
   across models for runoff, and to a lesser extent for vegetation
   biomass, GPP, and ecosystem respiration (Fig. B2, left panel). The
   skill score was lowest for leaf area index and net ecosystem exchange,
   with the widest disparity among models for soil carbon. Further
   analysis of the results will be provided separately, focusing on the
   strengths and weaknesses in the DGVM ensemble and its validity for use
   in the global carbon budget.

   The evaluation of the atmospheric inversions (Fig. B3) shows long-term
   mean biases in the free troposphere better than 0.8 ppm in absolute
   values for each product. CAMS and CTE biases show some dependency on
   latitude (a trend of
   [MATH: <mrow><mo>-</mo><mn
   mathvariant="normal">0.0018</mn><mo>±</mo><mn
   mathvariant="normal">0.0005</mn></mrow> :MATH]
   and 0.0043±0.0004 ppm per degree for CAMS and CTE, respectively). These
   latitude-dependent biases may reveal biases in the surface fluxes (e.g.
   Houweling et al., 2015) but the link is not straightforward and will be
   analysed separately. The biases for MIROC and CarboScope behave
   similarly together in relative values, but they are less regular than
   the two other products, which hampers the interpretation. Lesser model
   performance for specific aircraft programmes, like for the 4-year
   DISCOVER-AQ campaign in the continental US
   (https://discover-aq.larc.nasa.gov/, last access: 28 November 2018),
   contributes to this variability.

3.1.4 Budget imbalance

   The carbon budget imbalance (B[IM]; Eq. 1) quantifies the mismatch
   between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the
   atmosphere, land, and ocean reservoirs. The mean budget imbalance from
   1959 to 2017 is small (0.14 GtC yr^−1) and shows no trend over the full
   time series. The process models (GOBMs and DGVMs) have been selected to
   match observational constraints in the 1990s but no further constraints
   have been applied to their representation of trend and variability.
   Therefore, the near-zero mean and trend in the budget imbalance are
   indirect evidence of a coherent community understanding of the
   emissions and their partitioning on those timescales (Fig. 4). However,
   the budget imbalance shows substantial variability on the order of
   ±1 GtC yr^−1, particularly over semi-decadal timescales, although most
   of the variability is within the uncertainty of the estimates. The
   positive carbon imbalance during the 1960s, early 1990s, and in the
   last decade suggests that either the emissions were overestimated or
   the sinks were underestimated during these periods. The reverse is true
   for the 1970s and around 1995–2000 (Fig. 4).

   We cannot attribute the cause of the variability in the budget
   imbalance with our analysis, only to note that the budget imbalance is
   unlikely to be explained by errors or biases in the emissions alone
   because of its large semi-decadal variability component, a variability
   that is untypical of emissions and has not changed in the past 50 years
   in spite of a nearly tripling in emissions (Fig. 4). Errors in S[LAND]
   and S[OCEAN] are more likely to be the main cause for the budget
   imbalance. For example, underestimation of S[LAND] by DGVMs has been
   reported following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 possibly due
   to missing responses to changes in diffuse radiation (Mercado et al.,
   2009) or other yet unknown factors, and DGVMs are suspected to
   overestimate the land sink in response to the wet decade of the 1970s
   (Sitch et al., 2008). Decadal and semi-decadal variability in the ocean
   sink has been also reported recently (DeVries et al., 2017;
   Landschützer et al., 2015), with the pCO[2]-based ocean flux products
   suggesting a smaller-than-expected ocean CO[2] sink in the 1990s and a
   larger-than-expected sink in the 2000s (Fig. 7), possibly caused by
   changes in ocean circulation (DeVries et al., 2017) not captured in
   coarse-resolution GOBMs used here (Dufour et al., 2013). The absence of
   internal variability could also be at fault. Internal variability is
   not captured by single realisations of coarse-resolution model
   simulations (Li and Ilyina, 2018) and is thought to be largest in
   regions with strong seasonal and interannual climate variability, i.e.
   the high-latitude ocean regions (poleward of the subtropical gyres) and
   the equatorial Pacific (McKinley et al., 2016). Some of these errors
   could be driven by errors in the climatic forcing data, particularly
   precipitation (for S[LAND]) and wind (for S[OCEAN]), rather than in the
   models.

3.2 Global carbon budget for the last decade (2008–2017)

   The global carbon budget averaged over the last decade (2008–2017) is
   shown in Figs. 2 and 9. For this time period, 87 % of the total
   emissions (E[FF]+E[LUC]) were from fossil CO[2] emissions (E[FF]) and
   13 % were from land-use change (E[LUC]). The total emissions were
   partitioned among the atmosphere (44 %), ocean (22 %), and land (29 %),
   with a remaining unattributed budget imbalance (5 %).

3.2.1 CO[2] emissions

   Global fossil CO[2] emissions grew at a rate of 1.5 % yr^−1 for the
   last decade (2008–2017). China's emissions increased by +3.0 % yr^−1 on
   average (increasing by +0.64 GtC yr^−1 during the 10-year period),
   dominating the global trends, followed by India's emissions increase by
   +5.2 % yr^−1 (increasing by +0.25 GtC yr^−1), while emissions decreased
   in the EU28 by −1.8 % yr^−1 (decreasing by −0.17 GtC yr^−1), and in the
   US by 0.9 % yr^−1 (decreasing by −0.18 GtC yr^−1). In the past decade,
   fossil CO[2] emissions decreased significantly (at the 95 % level) in
   25 countries: Aruba, Barbados, Croatia, Czech Republic, North Korea,
   Denmark, France, Greece, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, the
   Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria,
   Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the US, Uzbekistan,
   and Venezuela. Notable was Germany, whose emissions did not decrease
   significantly.

   In contrast, there is no apparent trend in CO[2] emissions from
   land-use change (Fig. 6), though the data are very uncertain, with the
   two bookkeeping estimates showing opposite trends over the last decade.
   Larger emissions are expected increasingly over time for DGVM-based
   estimates as they include the loss of additional sink capacity, while
   the bookkeeping estimates do not. The LUH2 data set also features large
   dynamics in land use in particular in the tropics in recent years,
   causing higher emissions in DGVMs and BLUE than in H&N.

3.2.2 Partitioning among the atmosphere, ocean, and land

   The growth rate in atmospheric CO[2] concentration increased during
   2008–2017, in contrast to more constant levels the previous decade and
   reflecting a similar decrease in the land sink compared to an increase
   in the previous decade, albeit with large interannual variability
   (Fig. 4). During the same period, the ocean CO[2] sink appears to have
   intensified, an effect which is particularly apparent in the
   pCO[2]-based flux products (Fig. 7) and is thought to originate at
   least in part in the Southern Ocean (Landschützer et al., 2015).

   The budget imbalance (Table 6) and the residual sink from the global
   budget (Table 5) include an error term due to the inconsistency that
   arises from using E[LUC] from bookkeeping models but S[LAND] from
   DGVMs. This error term includes the fundamental differences between
   bookkeeping models and DGVMs, most notably the loss of additional sink
   capacity. Other differences include an incomplete account of land-use
   change practices and processes in DGVMs, while they are all accounted
   for in bookkeeping models by using observed carbon densities, and
   bookkeeping error of keeping present-day carbon densities fixed in the
   past. That the budget imbalance shows no clear trend towards larger
   values over time is an indication that the loss of additional sink
   capacity plays a minor role compared to other errors in S[LAND] or
   S[OCEAN] (discussed in Sect. 3.1.4).

3.2.3 Regional distribution

   Figure 8 shows the partitioning of the total atmosphere-to-surface
   fluxes excluding fossil CO[2] emissions (

   ) according to the multi-model average of the process models in the
   ocean and on land (GOBMs and DGVMs) and to the atmospheric inversions.
   Figure 8 provides information on the regional distribution of those
   fluxes by latitude bands. The global mean total atmosphere-to-surface
   CO[2] fluxes from process models for 2008–2017 is 3.7±1.2 GtC yr^−1.
   This is below but still within the uncertainty range of a global mean
   atmosphere-to-surface flux of 4.6±0.5 GtC yr^−1 inferred from the
   carbon budget (E[FF]–G[ATM] in Eq. 1; Table 6). The total
   atmosphere-to-surface CO[2] fluxes from the four inversions are very
   similar, ranging from 4.7 to 5.0 GtC yr^−1, consistent with the carbon
   budget as expected from the constraints on the inversions and the
   adjustments to the same E[FF] distribution (see Sect. 2.7).

   ) by latitude bands for the (top) globe (second row), north (north of
   30^∘ N), (third row) tropics (30^∘ S–30^∘ N), and (bottom) south (south
   of 30^∘ S) and (left) total, (middle) land only (S[LAND]−E[LUC]), and

   models for the land and oceans are shown (black for the total, green
   for the land, blue for the ocean) with ±1σ of the model ensemble (in
   grey). Results from the atmospheric inversions (pink lines) and from
   the pCO[2]-based flux products (dark blue lines) are also shown.

   In the south (south of 30^∘ S), the atmospheric inversions suggest an
   atmosphere-to-surface flux for 2008–2017 of around 1.6–1.7 GtC yr^−1,
   close to the process models' estimate of 1.4±0.7 GtC yr^−1 (Fig. 8).
   The interannual variability in the south is low because of the
   dominance of ocean area with low variability compared to land areas.
   The split between land (S[LAND]−E[LUC]) and ocean (S[OCEAN]) shows a
   small contribution to variability in the south coming from the land,
   with no consistency between the DGVMs and the inversions or among
   inversions. This is expected due to the difficulty of separating
   exactly the land and oceanic fluxes when viewed from atmospheric
   observations alone. The oceanic variability in the south is estimated
   to be significant in the two flux products and in at least one of the
   inversions, with decadal variability in around 0.5 GtC yr^−1. The GOBMs
   do not reproduce this variability.

   In the tropics (30^∘ S–30^∘ N), both the atmospheric inversions and
   process models suggest the total carbon balance in this region is close
   to neutral on average over the past decade, with atmosphere-to-surface
   fluxes for the 2008–2017 average ranging between −0.4 and
   +0.4 GtC yr^−1. The agreement between inversions and models is
   significantly better for the last decade than for any previous decade,
   although the reasons for this better agreement are still unclear. Both
   the process models and the inversions consistently allocate more
   year-to-year variability in CO[2] fluxes to the tropics compared to the
   north (north of 30^∘ N; Fig. 8). The split between the land and ocean
   indicates the land is the origin of most of the tropical variability,
   consistently among models (both for the land and for the ocean) and
   inversions. The oceanic variability in the tropics is similar among
   models and with the two ocean flux products, reflected in their lower
   observational mismatch (Sect. 3.1.3). While the inversions indicate
   that atmosphere-to-land CO[2] fluxes are more variable than
   atmosphere-to-ocean CO[2] fluxes in the tropics, the correspondence
   between the inversions and the ocean flux products or GOBMs is much
   poorer.

   In the north (north of 30^∘ N), the inversions and process models show
   less agreement on the magnitude of the atmosphere-to-land flux, with
   the ensemble mean of the process models suggesting a total Northern
   Hemisphere sink for 2008–2017 of 2.2±0.6 GtC yr^−1, likely below the
   estimates from the inversions ranging from 2.6 to 3.6 GtC yr^−1
   (Fig. 8). The discrepancy in the north-tropics distribution of CO[2]
   fluxes between the inversions and models arises from the differences in
   mean fluxes over the northern land. This discrepancy is also evidenced
   over the previous decade and highlights not only persistent issues with
   the quantification of the drivers of the net land CO[2] flux (Arneth et
   al., 2017; Huntzinger et al., 2017) but also the distribution of
   atmosphere-to-land fluxes between the tropics and higher latitudes that
   is particularly marked in previous decades, as highlighted previously
   (Stephens et al., 2007; Baccini et al., 2017; Schimel et al., 2015).

   Differences between inversions may be related for example to
   differences in their interhemispheric transport, and other inversion
   settings (Table A3). Separate analysis has shown that the influence of
   the chosen prior land and ocean fluxes is minor compared to other
   aspects of each inversion. In comparison to the previous global carbon
   budget publication, the fossil fuel inputs were adjusted to match those
   of E[FF] used in this analysis (see Sect. 2.7), therefore removing
   differences due to prior fossil emissions. Differences between
   inversions and the ensemble of process models in the north cannot be
   simply explained. They could either reflect a bias in the inversions or
   missing processes or biases in the process models, such as the lack of
   adequate parameterisations for forest management in the north and for
   forest degradation emissions in the tropics for the DGVMs. The
   estimated contribution of the north and its uncertainty from process
   models is sensitive to both the ensemble of process models used and the
   specifics of each inversion.

   Resolving the differences in the Northern Hemisphere land sink will
   require the consideration and inclusion of larger volumes of
   semi-continuous observations from tall towers close to the surface
   CO[2]exchange. Some of these data are becoming available but not used
   in the current inverse models, sometimes due to the short records and
   sometimes because the coarse transport models cannot adequately
   represent these time series. Improvements in model resolution and
   atmospheric transport realism together with expansion of the
   observational record (also in the data-sparse Boreal Eurasian area)
   will help anchor the mid-latitude fluxes per continent. In addition,
   new metrics could potentially differentiate between the more and less
   realistic realisations of the Northern Hemisphere land sink shown in
   Fig. 8.

3.2.4 Budget imbalance

   The budget imbalance was +0.5 GtC yr^−1 on average over 2008–2017.
   Although the uncertainties are large in each term, the sustained
   imbalance over this last decade suggests an overestimation of the
   emissions and/or an underestimation of the sinks. An origin in the land
   and/or ocean sink may be more likely, given the large variability in
   the land sink and the suspected underestimation of decadal variability
   in the ocean sink. An underestimate of S[LAND] would also reconcile
   model results with inversion estimates for fluxes in the total land
   during the past decade (Fig. 8; Table 5). However, we cannot exclude
   that the budget imbalance over the last decade could partly be due to
   an overestimation of CO[2] emissions from land-use change, given their
   large uncertainty, as has been suggested elsewhere (Piao et al., 2018).
   More integrated use of observations in the Global Carbon Budget, either
   on their own or for further constraining model results, should help
   resolve some of the budget imbalance (Peters et al., 2017; Sect. 4).

3.3 Global carbon budget for the year 2017

3.3.1 CO[2] emissions

   Preliminary estimates of global fossil CO[2] emissions based on BP
   energy statistics are for emissions growing by 1.6 % between 2016 and
   2017 to 9.9±0.5 GtC in 2017 (Fig. 5), distributed among coal (40 %),
   oil (35 %), gas (20 %), cement (4 %), and gas flaring (0.7 %). Compared
   to the previous year, emissions from coal increased by 1.6 %, while
   emissions from oil, gas, and cement increased by 1.7 %, 3.0 %, and
   1.2 %, respectively. All growth rates presented are adjusted for the
   leap year, unless stated otherwise.

   The growth in emissions of 1.6 % in 2017 is within the range of the
   projected growth of 2.0 % (range of 0.8 to 3.0 %) published in Le Quéré
   et al. (2018) based on national emission projections for China, the US,
   and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for I[FF]
   trends for the rest of the world. The growth in emissions in 2017 for
   China, the US, and the rest of the world is also within their
   previously projected range, while the growth in India was slightly
   above the projection (Table 7).

   Table 7Comparison of the projection with realised fossil CO[2]
   emissions (E[FF]). The “Actual” values are the first estimate available
   using actual data, and the “Projected” values refer to the estimate
   made before the end of the year for each publication. Projections based
   on a different method from that described here during 2008–2014 are
   available in Le Quéré et al. (2016). All values are adjusted for leap
   years.

   In 2017, the largest absolute contributions to global CO[2] emissions
   were from China (27 %), the US (15 %), the EU (28 member states; 10 %),
   and India (7 %) while the rest of the world contributed 42 %. The
   percentages are the fraction of the global emissions including bunker
   fuels (3.1 %). These four regions account for 59 % of global CO[2]
   emissions. Growth rates for these countries from 2016 to 2017 were
   +1.5 % (China), −0.5 % (US), +1.2 % (EU28), and +3.9 % (India), with
   +1.9 % for the rest of the world. The per capita CO[2] emissions in
   2017 were 1.1 tC person^−1 yr^−1 for the globe and were 4.4 (US), 2.0
   (China), 1.9 (EU28), and 0.5 (India) tC person^−1 yr^−1 for the four
   highest emitting countries (Fig. 5).

   In 2016 (the last year available), the largest absolute contributions
   to global CO[2] emissions from a consumption perspective were China
   (25 %), the US (16 %), the EU (12 %), and India (6 %). The difference
   between territorial and consumption emissions (the net emission
   transfer via international trade) has generally increased from 1990 to
   around 2005 and remained relatively stable afterwards until the last
   year available (2016; Fig. 5).

   The global CO[2] emissions from land-use change are estimated as
   1.4±0.7 GtC in 2017, close to the previous decade but with low
   confidence in the annual change. This brings the total CO[2] emissions
   from fossil fuels plus land-use change (E[FF]+E[LUC]) to 11.3±0.9 GtC
   (41.2±3 GtCO[2]).

3.3.2 Partitioning among the atmosphere, ocean, and land

   The growth rate in atmospheric CO[2] concentration was 4.6±0.2 GtC in
   2017 (2.16±0.09 ppm; Fig. 4; Dlugokencky and Tans, 2018). This is near
   the 2008–2017 average of 4.7±0.1 GtC yr^−1 and reflects the return to
   normal conditions after the El Niño of 2015–2016.

   The estimated ocean CO[2] sink was 2.5±0.5 GtC in 2017. All models and
   data products estimate a small reduction or no change in the sink
   (average of 0.1, ranging from +0.02 to −0.4 GtC), consistent with the
   return to normal conditions after the El Niño, which caused an enhanced
   sink in previous years (Fig. 7).

   The terrestrial CO[2] sink from the model ensemble was 3.8±0.8 GtC in
   2017, above the decadal average (Fig. 4) and consistent with
   constraints from the rest of the budget (Table 5).

   The budget imbalance was +0.3 GtC in 2017, indicating, as for the last
   decade, a small overestimation of the emissions and/or underestimation
   of the sinks for that year. This imbalance is indicative only, given
   the large uncertainties in the estimation of the B[IM].

3.4 Global carbon budget projection for the year 2018

3.4.1 CO[2] emissions

   Based on available data as of 7 November 2018 (see Sect. 2.1.5), fossil
   CO[2] emissions (E[FF]) for 2018 are projected to increase by +2.7 %
   (range of 1.8 % to +3.7 %; Table 7). Our method contains several
   assumptions that could influence the estimate beyond the given range,
   and as such, it has an indicative value only. Within the given
   assumptions, global emissions would be 10.1±0.5 GtC (37.1±1.8 GtCO[2])
   in 2018. The interpretation of the 2018 emission projection is provided
   elsewhere (Figueres et al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2018).

   For China, the expected change is for an increase in emissions of
   +4.7 % (range of +2.0 % to +7.4 %) in 2018 compared to 2017. This is
   based on estimated growth in coal (+4.5 %; the main fuel source in
   China), oil (+3.6 %), natural gas (+17.7 %) consumption, and cement
   production (+1.0 %). The uncertainty range considers the variations in
   the difference between preliminary January–September data and final
   full-year data, the uncertainty in the preliminary data used for the
   2017 base, and uncertainty in the evolution of energy density and
   carbon content of coal. See also Liu et al. (2018) for further analysis
   of China's projected emissions.

   carbon (GtC). All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. The budget
   imbalance provides a measure of the discrepancies among the nearly
   independent estimates. Its uncertainty exceeds ±60 GtC. The method used
   here does not capture the loss of additional sink capacity from reduced
   forest cover, which is about 20 GtC and would exacerbate the budget
   imbalance (see Sect. 2.8.4). All values are rounded to the nearest
   5 GtC and therefore columns do not necessarily add to zero.

   For the US, the EIA emission projection for 2018 combined with cement
   data from USGS give an increase of 2.5 % (range of +0.5 to +4.5 %)
   compared to 2017.

   For the European Union, our projection for 2018 is for a decrease of
   −0.7 % (range of −2.6 % to +1.3 %) over 2017. This is based on
   estimates for coal of −1.2 %, oil of +1.2 %, gas of −2.9 %, and stable
   cement emissions.

   For India, our projection for 2018 is for an increase of +6.3 % (range
   of 4.3 % to +8.3 %) over 2017. This is based on separate projections
   for coal (+7.1 %), oil (+2.9 %), gas (+6.0 %), and cement (+13.4 %).

   For the rest of the world, the expected growth for 2018 is +1.8 %
   (range of +0.5 % to +3.0 %). This is computed using the GDP projection
   for the world excluding China, the US, the EU, and India of 2.8 % made
   by the IMF (IMF, 2018) and a decrease in I[FF] of −1.0 % yr^−1, which
   is the average from 2008 to 2017. The uncertainty range is based on the
   standard deviation of the interannual variability in I[FF] during
   2008–2017 of ±0.7 % yr^−1 and our estimate of uncertainty in the IMF's
   GDP forecast of ±0.5 %.

   Preliminary estimates of fire emissions in deforestation zones indicate
   that emissions from land-use change (E[LUC]) for 2018 were below
   average until October and are expected to range between 0.1 and 0.2
   lower than the 2008–2017 average. We therefore expect E[LUC] emissions
   of around 1.2 GtC in 2018, for total CO[2] emissions of 11.3±0.9 GtC
   (41.5±3 GtCO[2]).

3.4.2 Partitioning among the atmosphere, ocean, and land

   The 2018 growth in atmospheric CO[2] concentration (G[ATM]) is
   projected to be 4.9±0.7 GtC (2.3±0.3 ppm) based on MLO observations
   until the end of October 2018, bringing the atmospheric CO[2]
   concentration to an expected level of 407 ppm averaged over the year.
   Combining projected E[FF], E[LUC], and G[ATM] suggests a combined land
   and ocean sink (S[LAND]+S[OCEAN]) of about 6.5 GtC for 2018. Although
   each term has large uncertainty, the oceanic sink S[OCEAN] has
   generally low interannual variability and is likely to remain close to
   its 2017 value of around 2.5 GtC, leaving a rough estimated land sink
   S[LAND] of around 4.0 GtC. If realised, it would be among the largest
   S[LAND] values over the historical period. However, the possible onset
   of an El Niño at the end of 2018 could reduce S[LAND], with G[ATM]
   returning to a high growth rate towards the end of the year.

3.5 Cumulative sources and sinks

   Cumulative historical sources and sinks are estimated as in Eq. (1)
   with semi-independent estimates for each term and a global carbon
   budget imbalance. Cumulative fossil CO[2] emissions for 1870–2017 were
   425±20 GtC for E[FF] and 190±75 GtC for E[LUC] (Table 8; Fig. 9), for a
   total of 615±80 GtC. The cumulative emissions from E[LUC] are
   particularly uncertain, with large spread among individual estimates of
   135 GtC (Houghton) and 240 GtC (BLUE) for the two bookkeeping models
   and a similar wide estimate of 180±75 GtC for the DGVMs. These
   estimates are consistent with indirect constraints from vegetation
   biomass observations (Li et al., 2017), but given the large spread a
   best estimate is difficult to ascertain.

   global carbon budget, defined as input data or processes that have a
   demonstrated effect of at least ±0.3 GtC yr^−1.

   uncertainties in G[ATM] have been estimated as ±0.2 GtC yr^−1, although

   atmosphere introduces additional errors that have not yet been
   quantified. ^c Could in part be due to uncertainties in
   atmospheric forcing (Swart et al., 2014).

   (150±20 GtC), and the land (190±50 GtC). The use of nearly independent
   estimates for the individual terms shows a cumulative budget imbalance
   of 25 GtC during 1870–2017 (Fig. 2), which, if correct, suggests
   emissions are too high by the same proportion or the land or ocean
   sinks are underestimated. The bulk of the imbalance is likely to
   originate largely from the large estimation of E[LUC] between the
   mid-1920s and the mid-1960s, which is unmatched by a growth in
   atmospheric CO[2] concentration as recorded in ice cores (Fig. 3). The
   known loss of additional sink capacity of about 20 GtC due to reduced
   forest cover has not been accounted for in our method and would further
   exacerbate the budget imbalance (Sect. 2.8.4). Cumulative emissions
   through to the year 2018 increase to 625±80 GtC (2290±290 GtCO[2]),
   with about a 70 % contribution from E[FF] and about a 30 % contribution
   from E[LUC]. Cumulative emissions and their partitioning for different
   periods are provided in Table 8.

   Given the large and persistent uncertainties in cumulative emissions,
   we suggest extreme caution is needed if using cumulative emission
   estimates to determine the remaining carbon budget to stay below the
   given temperature limit (Rogelj et al., 2016). We suggest estimating
   the remaining carbon budget by integrating scenario data from the
   current time to some time in the future (Millar et al., 2017).
   4 Discussion
   Back to toptop

   Each year when the global carbon budget is published, each flux
   component is updated for all previous years to consider corrections
   that are the result of further scrutiny and verification of the
   underlying data in the primary input data sets. Annual estimates may
   improve with improvements in data quality and timeliness (e.g. to
   eliminate the need for extrapolation of forcing data such as land use).
   Of the various terms in the global budget, only the fossil CO[2]
   emissions and the growth rate in atmospheric CO[2] concentration are
   based primarily on empirical inputs supporting annual estimates in this
   carbon budget. Although it is an imperfect measure, the carbon budget
   imbalance provides a strong indication of the limitations in
   observations, in understanding or full representation of processes in
   models, and/or in the integration of the carbon budget components.

   The persistent unexplained variability in the carbon budget imbalance
   limits our ability to verify reported emissions (Peters et al., 2017)
   and suggests we do not yet have a complete understanding of the
   underlying carbon cycle processes. Resolving most of this unexplained
   variability should be possible through different and complementary
   approaches. First, as intended with our annual updates, the imbalance
   as an error term is reduced by improvements of individual components of
   the global carbon budget that follow from improving the underlying data
   and statistics and by improving the models through the resolution of
   some of the key uncertainties detailed in Table 9. Second, additional
   clues to the origin and processes responsible for the current imbalance
   could be obtained through a closer scrutiny of carbon variability in
   light of other Earth system data (e.g. heat balance, water balance),
   and the use of a wider range of biogeochemical observations to better
   understand the land–ocean partitioning of the carbon imbalance (e.g.
   oxygen, carbon isotopes). Finally, additional information could also be
   obtained through higher resolution and process knowledge at the
   regional level and through the introduction of inferred fluxes such as
   those based on satellite CO[2] retrievals. The limit of the resolution
   of the carbon budget imbalance is yet unclear but most certainly not
   yet reached given the possibilities for improvements that lie ahead.

   The assessment of the GOBMs used for S[OCEAN] with flux products based
   on observations highlights substantial discrepancy at mid-latitudes and
   high latitudes. Given the good data coverage of pCO[2] observations in
   the Northern Hemisphere (Bakker et al., 2016), this discrepancy points
   to an underestimation of variability in the GOBMs globally, and
   consequently the variability in S[OCEAN] appears to be underestimated.
   The size of this underestimate (order of 0.5 GtC yr^−1) could account
   for some of the budget imbalance, but not all. Increasing model
   resolution and incorporating internal variability (Li and Ilyina, 2018)
   have been suggested as ways to increase model variability
   (Sect. 3.1.4).

   The assessment of the net land–atmosphere exchange derived from land
   sink and net land use change flux with atmospheric inversions also
   shows substantial discrepancy, particularly for the estimate of the
   total land flux over the northern extra-tropics in the past decade.
   This discrepancy highlights the difficulty to quantify complex
   processes (CO[2] fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, climate change and
   variability, land management, etc.) that collectively determine the net
   land CO[2] flux. Resolving the differences in the Northern Hemisphere
   land sink will require the consideration and inclusion of larger
   volumes of observations (Sect. 3.2.3).

   Estimates of E[LUC] suffer from a range of intertwined issues,
   including the poor quality of historical land cover and land-use change
   maps, the rudimentary representation of management processes in most
   models, and the confusion in methodologies and boundary conditions used
   across methods (e.g. Pongratz et al., 2014; Arneth et al., 2017, and
   Sect. 2.8.4 on the loss of sink capacity). Uncertainties in current and
   historical carbon stocks in soils and vegetation also add uncertainty
   in the land-use change flux estimates. Unless a major effort to resolve
   these issues is made, little progress is expected in the resolution of
   E[LUC]. This is particularly concerning given the growing importance of
   E[LUC] for climate mitigation strategies and the large issues in the
   quantification of the cumulative emissions over the historical period
   that arise from large uncertainties in E[LUC].

   To move towards the resolution of the carbon budget imbalance, this
   year we have introduced metrics for the evaluation of the ocean and
   land models and atmospheric inversions. These metrics expand the use of
   observations in the global carbon budget, helping (1) to support
   improvements in the ocean and land carbon models that produce the sink
   estimates and (2) to constrain the representation of key underlying
   processes in the models and to allocate the regional partitioning of
   the CO[2] fluxes. This is an initial step towards the introduction of a
   broader range of observations that we hope will support continued
   improvements in the annual estimates of the global carbon budget.

   We assessed elsewhere (Peters et al., 2017) that a sustained decrease
   of −1 % in global emissions could be detected at the 66 % likelihood
   level after a decade only. Similarly, a change in behaviour of the land
   and/or ocean carbon sink would take as long to detect, and much longer
   if it emerges more slowly. Reducing the carbon imbalance, regionalising
   the carbon budget, and integrating multiple variables are powerful ways
   to shorten the detection limit and ensure the research community can
   rapidly identify growing issues of concern in the evolution of the
   global carbon cycle under the current rapid and unprecedented changing
   environmental conditions.

   6 Conclusions
   Back to toptop

   The estimation of global CO[2] emissions and sinks is a major effort by
   the carbon cycle research community that requires a careful compilation
   and synthesis of measurements, statistical estimates, and model
   results. The delivery of an annual carbon budget serves two purposes.
   First, there is a large demand for up-to-date information on the state
   of the anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system and its
   underpinning causes. A broad stakeholder community relies on the data
   sets associated with the annual carbon budget including scientists,
   policymakers, businesses, journalists, and non-governmental
   organisations engaged in adapting to and mitigating human-driven
   climate change. Second, over the last decade we have seen unprecedented
   changes in the human and biophysical environments (e.g. changes in the
   growth of fossil fuel emissions, Earth's temperatures, and strength of
   the carbon sinks), which call for frequent assessments of the state of
   the planet and a growing understanding of and improved capacity to
   anticipate the evolution of the carbon cycle in the future. Building
   this scientific understanding to meet the extraordinary climate
   mitigation challenge requires frequent, robust, and transparent data
   sets and methods that can be scrutinised and replicated. This paper via
   living data helps to keep track of new budget updates.

   Short summary
   The Global Carbon Budget 2018 describes the data sets and methodology
   used to quantify the emissions of carbon dioxide and their partitioning
   among the atmosphere, land, and ocean. These living data are updated
   every year to provide the highest transparency and traceability in the
   reporting of CO[2], the key driver of climate change.
