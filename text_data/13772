   Oh, Monday. You’re back again. Not only was it a busy day at work, but
   it was also Shea’s 5-year well child appointment and flu shots for both
   girls. CUE ALL THE TEARS. I mean, I hate getting shots, too…but
   rationalizing with tiny humans is soul-sucking after minutes #1 and #2.

   I joke that I nearly put the girls on Facebook Garage Sale yesterday.
   They were driving me nuts! I much prefer weekends with 2 parents
   around, let me tell you. Yesterday was exhausting. I got up this
   morning just to catch some alone time (and to finish this post). 😊
   Yesterday was my first time ... Read More about Slow Cooker Beef Ragu

Family Friday (vol. 100): Fall Updates

   Hello, fall. And sadly, it looks like we'll be saying hello to lots of
   rain this weekend, too. NOT COOL. Mark also departs for a work trip and
   so the girls and I will have LOTS of 1:1 time. Wish me luck ;) How that
   man goes to India and back in less than 5 days...yeah, it's insane. And
   for someone ... Read More about Family Friday (vol. 100): Fall Updates

   You know how some weeks are just…crap. That’s this week. I haven’t had
   one in awhile so I guess I’m due for one. Work has been stressful and
   I’m just frustrated. Details may not go here but if you were in my
   head, you’d be like, “Whoa”. Mark has a man cold and yesterday was his
   birthday. ‘Nuff ... Read More about Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao)

   With everyone in our family and extended families having had a busy
   August, it has been rather quiet in our guest quarters (coughcough,
   basement). However, we knew we’d get some visitors in September with
   the girls’ joint birthday party! That event was yesterday – phew. Shea

   The girls have been asking why it’s so dark when we put them to bed at
   night. I guess this is the irony of living on the eastern side of the
   east coast time zone -- it’s light out well past 9pm for much of the
   year. And yet, the mornings have gone DARK. QUICKLY. I can’t imagine
   our time falling back ... Read More about Spicy Fish Taco Bowls with

   It has been a busy week! I was busy with work, trying to get organized
   for family pictures, getting organized for the girls’ birthday party
   next weekend, prepping for an upcoming podcast, and even snuck in a
   trip to Chicago to go see my best friend’s baby – a boy, born 3 weeks
   early! Two surprises ... Read More about Tangy Sweet-and-Sour Meatballs

   Mark and I did something we hardly ever do – we laid in bed last night
   and talked until it was well past our bedtime. Do other married couples
   sometimes forget to TALK beyond conversations having do to with the
   daily grind? I told him the days just whip by and I wish there were
   more hours in the day ... Read More about 10th Annual Chili Contest:
