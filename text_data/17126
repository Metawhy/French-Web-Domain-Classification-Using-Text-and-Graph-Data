   Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest iron ore producers, has today
   signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with China's largest steel
   producer, China Baowu Steel Group and Tsinghua University, one of
   China's most prestigious and influential universities (the Parties), to
   develop and implement new methods to reduce carbon emissions and
   improve environmental performance across the steel value chain. The
   China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) invited the Parties to sign the
   MOU at its China International Steel and Raw Materials Conference held
   in Qingdao.

   The MOU will enable the formation of a joint working group tasked with
   identifying a pathway to support the goal of reducing carbon emissions
   across the entire steel value chain, which accounts for between seven
   and nine per cent of the world's carbon emissions.^1 The working group
   will establish a joint action plan on how to best utilise the Parties'
   complementary strengths in research and development, technologies,
   processes, equipment, logistics, industry coordination and policy
   advisory capacities to combat climate change and improve environmental
   performance.

   Rio Tinto chief executive, J-S Jacques said "This pioneering
   partnership across the steel value chain will bring together solutions
   to help address the steel industry's carbon footprint and improve its
   environmental performance.

   "The materials we produce have an important role to play in the
   transition to a low carbon future and we are committed to partnering
   with our customers and others to find the most sustainable ways to
   produce, process and market them. We are already doing this in
   aluminium and now, through this partnership, we will be doing it in the
   steel industry.

   "We thank CISA for its support and look forward to collaborating with
   China's largest steel producer, China Baowu, and Tsinghua University, a
   global leader in climate change research and collaboration."

   China Baowu chairman, Chen Derong said "China Baowu is committed to
   ecological and sustainable development. We will promote sustainable
   production through intelligent manufacturing. We want to make a
   difference to the iron and steel ecosystem by developing greener
   factories and enterprises to deliver a cleaner, more sustainable steel
   industry. China Baowu looks forward to exploring low-carbon
   metallurgical innovation with Rio Tinto and Tsinghua University, and
   building a low-carbon industrial value chain. We hope to jointly
   address climate challenges with our partners, and create a model of
   harmonious coexistence between cities and steel mills."

   Tsinghua University Vice President You Zheng said "Tsinghua is
   committed to providing solutions to climate change challenges and
   contributing wisdom to sustainable development. Initiating the Global
   Alliance of Universities on Climate is an important milestone, and just
   one example. The signing will enable us to work closely with the
   upstream and downstream of the steel industry value chain to jointly
   find the solution to the industry’s low-carbon transformation."

   Notes for editors

   About Rio Tinto

   Rio Tinto produces materials that are essential to human progress. We
   have publicly acknowledged the reality of climate change for over two
   decades and have reduced our emissions footprint by over 30 per cent
   since 2008. In 2015, in support of the Paris Agreement, we committed to
   substantial long-term decarbonisation by 2050. In 2018, we completed
   the divestment of our coal assets, becoming the only major mining
   company not producing fossil fuels. Almost 70 per cent of the
   electricity used across our business is from low-carbon renewable
   energy. In 2018, we announced a pioneering new technology partnership
   with Alcoa, with support from Apple and the governments of Canada and
   Quebec, to further develop carbon-free aluminium smelting technology –
   an industry first.

   Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest iron ore producers, has today
   signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with China's largest steel
   producer, China Baowu Steel Group and Tsinghua University, one of
   China's most prestigious and influential universities (the Parties), to
   develop and implement new methods to reduce carbon emissions and
   improve environmental performance across the steel value chain. The
   China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) invited the Parties to sign the
   MOU at its China International Steel and Raw Materials Conference held
   in Qingdao.

   The MOU will enable the formation of a joint working group tasked with
   identifying a pathway to support the goal of reducing carbon emissions
   across the entire steel value chain, which accounts for between seven
   and nine per cent of the world's carbon emissions.^1 The working group
   will establish a joint action plan on how to best utilise the Parties'
   complementary strengths in research and development, technologies,
   processes, equipment, logistics, industry coordination and policy
   advisory capacities to combat climate change and improve environmental
   performance.

   Rio Tinto chief executive, J-S Jacques said "This pioneering
   partnership across the steel value chain will bring together solutions
   to help address the steel industry's carbon footprint and improve its
   environmental performance.

   "The materials we produce have an important role to play in the
   transition to a low carbon future and we are committed to partnering
   with our customers and others to find the most sustainable ways to
   produce, process and market them. We are already doing this in
   aluminium and now, through this partnership, we will be doing it in the
   steel industry.

   "We thank CISA for its support and look forward to collaborating with
   China's largest steel producer, China Baowu, and Tsinghua University, a
   global leader in climate change research and collaboration."

   China Baowu chairman, Chen Derong said "China Baowu is committed to
   ecological and sustainable development. We will promote sustainable
   production through intelligent manufacturing. We want to make a
   difference to the iron and steel ecosystem by developing greener
   factories and enterprises to deliver a cleaner, more sustainable steel
   industry. China Baowu looks forward to exploring low-carbon
   metallurgical innovation with Rio Tinto and Tsinghua University, and
   building a low-carbon industrial value chain. We hope to jointly
   address climate challenges with our partners, and create a model of
   harmonious coexistence between cities and steel mills."

   Tsinghua University Vice President You Zheng said "Tsinghua is
   committed to providing solutions to climate change challenges and
   contributing wisdom to sustainable development. Initiating the Global
   Alliance of Universities on Climate is an important milestone, and just
   one example. The signing will enable us to work closely with the
   upstream and downstream of the steel industry value chain to jointly
   find the solution to the industry’s low-carbon transformation."

   Notes for editors

   About Rio Tinto

   Rio Tinto produces materials that are essential to human progress. We
   have publicly acknowledged the reality of climate change for over two
   decades and have reduced our emissions footprint by over 30 per cent
   since 2008. In 2015, in support of the Paris Agreement, we committed to
   substantial long-term decarbonisation by 2050. In 2018, we completed
   the divestment of our coal assets, becoming the only major mining
   company not producing fossil fuels. Almost 70 per cent of the
   electricity used across our business is from low-carbon renewable
   energy. In 2018, we announced a pioneering new technology partnership
   with Alcoa, with support from Apple and the governments of Canada and
   Quebec, to further develop carbon-free aluminium smelting technology –
   an industry first.

Rio Tinto offers independently certified responsibly produced aluminium from
all Canadian operations

   Rio Tinto is now offering independently certified responsibly produced
   aluminium from all of its Canadian operations, with the extension of
   the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative’s (ASI) Chain of Custody
   certification to include the BC Works smelter and Kemano Power
   Operations in Kitimat, British Columbia.

   The certification reinforces Rio Tinto’s commitment to responsible
   mining and metals production by providing independent verification that
   material can be traced through a ‘chain of custody’ spanning Rio
   Tinto’s Gove bauxite mine in Australia to its alumina refinery,
   aluminium smelters and casthouses in Quebec and British Columbia,
   Canada.

   ASI certification means customers can be assured the aluminium
   purchased through Rio Tinto’s Canadian operations has been produced to
   the highest environmental, social and governance standards.

   Rio Tinto has led the establishment of responsible production
   certification for the aluminium industry as a founding member of the
   ASI, working alongside customers and a broad range of stakeholders.

   Rio Tinto Aluminium vice president sales and marketing and ASI Board
   member Tolga Egrilmezer said “This certification continues Rio Tinto’s
   leadership on responsible production. It increases the availability of
   ASI certified aluminium in a range of markets, giving customers the
   ability to offer end consumers products made with aluminium that meets
   the highest sustainability standards.”

   ASI chief executive officer Fiona Solomon said “We applaud Rio Tinto
   for their commitment to ASI’s mission since joining as a founding
   member, and for continuing to extend the reach of their ASI certified
   operations. This successful Chain of Custody certification demonstrates
   ASI’s potential to create impact through voluntary uptake of its
   program. We are seeing the positive upstream examples like this one now
   extending into downstream aluminium use sectors such as automotive,
   construction and packaging, and this is very encouraging.”

   Notes to editors

   Rio Tinto produces some of the highest quality, lowest carbon footprint
   aluminium in the world at its Canadian smelters and launched the
   industry’s first certified low carbon aluminium, RenewAl^TM, in 2016.

   In 2018, Rio Tinto was the first company to receive the ASI’s first
   Performance Standard certification – the highest internationally
   recognised standard for robust environmental, social and governance
   practices – and Chain of Custody certification, covering five aluminium
   smelters, the Vaudreuil refinery, casting centres, port and railway
   facilities in Quebec, Canada.

   The BC Works smelter and Kemano Power Operations received certification
   against the Performance Standard in January 2019 and have now been
   included in the Chain of Custody certification.

   Rio Tinto is now working with the ASI on audits and certifications for
   other sites in its global aluminium business.

   The ASI is a global, multi-stakeholder, non-profit standards setting
   and certification organisation. It works toward responsible production,
   sourcing and stewardship of aluminium following an entire value chain
   approach. ASI launched its Performance Standard and Chain of Custody
   Standard in December 2017.

   ASI’s 60+ members include leading civil society organisations,
   companies with activities in bauxite mining, alumina refining,
   aluminium smelting, semi-fabrication, product and component
   manufacturing, as well as consumer and commercial goods, including the
   automotive industry, construction and packaging, as well as industry
   associations and other supporters.

   Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest iron ore producers, has today
   signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with China's largest steel
   producer, China Baowu Steel Group and Tsinghua University, one of
   China's most prestigious and influential universities (the Parties), to
   develop and implement new methods to reduce carbon emissions and
   improve environmental performance across the steel value chain. The
   China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) invited the Parties to sign the
   MOU at its China International Steel and Raw Materials Conference held
   in Qingdao.

   The MOU will enable the formation of a joint working group tasked with
   identifying a pathway to support the goal of reducing carbon emissions
   across the entire steel value chain, which accounts for between seven
   and nine per cent of the world's carbon emissions.^1 The working group
   will establish a joint action plan on how to best utilise the Parties'
   complementary strengths in research and development, technologies,
   processes, equipment, logistics, industry coordination and policy
   advisory capacities to combat climate change and improve environmental
   performance.

   Rio Tinto chief executive, J-S Jacques said "This pioneering
   partnership across the steel value chain will bring together solutions
   to help address the steel industry's carbon footprint and improve its
   environmental performance.

   "The materials we produce have an important role to play in the
   transition to a low carbon future and we are committed to partnering
   with our customers and others to find the most sustainable ways to
   produce, process and market them. We are already doing this in
   aluminium and now, through this partnership, we will be doing it in the
   steel industry.

   "We thank CISA for its support and look forward to collaborating with
   China's largest steel producer, China Baowu, and Tsinghua University, a
   global leader in climate change research and collaboration."

   China Baowu chairman, Chen Derong said "China Baowu is committed to
   ecological and sustainable development. We will promote sustainable
   production through intelligent manufacturing. We want to make a
   difference to the iron and steel ecosystem by developing greener
   factories and enterprises to deliver a cleaner, more sustainable steel
   industry. China Baowu looks forward to exploring low-carbon
   metallurgical innovation with Rio Tinto and Tsinghua University, and
   building a low-carbon industrial value chain. We hope to jointly
   address climate challenges with our partners, and create a model of
   harmonious coexistence between cities and steel mills."

   Tsinghua University Vice President You Zheng said "Tsinghua is
   committed to providing solutions to climate change challenges and
   contributing wisdom to sustainable development. Initiating the Global
   Alliance of Universities on Climate is an important milestone, and just
   one example. The signing will enable us to work closely with the
   upstream and downstream of the steel industry value chain to jointly
   find the solution to the industry’s low-carbon transformation."
