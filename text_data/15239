Description of Grand Theft Auto V

   Buy Grand Theft Auto V as a Rockstar Key.

   When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying
   psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening
   and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government
   and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of
   dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust
   nobody, least of all each other.

   Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the
   award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of
   up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game
   running at 60 frames per second.

   The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization
   options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture
   quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as
   support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls.
   Additional options include a population density slider to control car
   and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D
   compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support.

   Grand Theft Auto V also comes with Grand Theft Auto Online, the dynamic
   and ever-evolving Grand Theft Auto universe with online play for up to
   30 players, including all existing gameplay upgrades and content
   released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online. Rise through the
   ranks to become a CEO of a criminal empire by trading contraband or
   form a motorcycle club and rule the streets; pull off complex
   co-operative Heists or enter radical, adrenaline-fueled Stunt Races;
   compete in unique Adversary modes; or create your own content to play
   and share with the Grand Theft Auto Community.

   The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online
   features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the
   incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an
   entirely new way.

   Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor,
   a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit
   and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft
   Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the
   ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters,
   pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with
   advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and
   slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own
   music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the
   intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded
   directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games
   Social Club for easy sharing.

   Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new
   radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music
   from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original
   soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt,
   Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future
   Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine
   County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio
   station that will host player-created custom soundtracks.

   SPECIAL CONTENT FOR RETURNING PLAYERS
   Players returning from the PS3™ and Xbox 360 versions get special
   access to a host of content on PC including rare versions of classic
   vehicles to collect from across the Grand Theft Auto series such as the
   Dukes, the Dodo Seaplane and a faster, more maneuverable Blimp;
   activities including wildlife photography and new shooting range
   challenges, new weapons and more.

   Special access content requires Rockstar Games Social Club account.
   Visit rockstargames.com/v/bonuscontent for details.

   "A sandbox of extraordinary scope created with a masterful attention to
   detail. A patchy campaign doesn't spoil this wonderful, evocative
   city."

   – Chris Thursten, PC Gamer

   "It's one of the best games available today."

   – Dan Stapleton, IGN

   "GTA V remains a benchmark game, and its graphical improvements are
   hugely impressive, but it's the addition of a first-person mode that
   transforms it into a very different beast."
