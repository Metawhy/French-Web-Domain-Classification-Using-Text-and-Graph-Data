     As a fiction writer who uses git heavily, I love @madebyloren 's
     idea for a "Github for Writers": Penflip. http://t.co/Qa5CW6sy5q

     If you're in a newsroom and not toying around with
     http://t.co/g3CDCGFuAQ, you're behind. Congrats @madebyloren on a
     great system.

     Github for writers! Looks very useful for version control with a
     bunch of value ads: https://t.co/U24oS8AEwx

     Ever wished there was a GitHub for writers? There is now: Penflip.
     And it's pretty awesome. http://t.co/Ea8Zrw4gCv
