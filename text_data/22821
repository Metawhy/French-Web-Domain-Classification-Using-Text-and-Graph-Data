The "From Hell" Letter

   In 1888, several women were murdered in the East End section of London
   and mutilated in ways that suggested the culprit had substantial
   anatomical knowledge. Authorities received hundreds of letters
   regarding the murders, including a number of taunting notes purportedly
   from the killer himself—"Jack the Ripper." However, many of the letters
   were believed to be hoaxes. One of the few notes thought to be

Mark Rothko (1903)

   Largely self-taught, Rothko was an American painter who became a
   leading exponent of a uniquely personal strain within the larger
   movement of abstract expressionism. By 1950, he was creating his
   so-called color-field paintings, works with large rectangles of color
   that express moods. In 1970, he committed suicide shortly after
   completing what some regard as his masterwork, a group of murals for a
   chapel in Houston, Texas. For what record-breaking price did one of
   Rothko's paintings sell in 2007? More... Discuss

Marshall Islands Lutok Kobban Alele

   The inhabitants of the Marshall Islands have long kept a tradition
   centered on the alele, a soft-sided basket handmade from the native
   pandanus plant. "Lutok Kobban Alele" is a weeklong festival that honors
   the basket as a national symbol and celebrates Marshallese culture in
   general, concluding with an official ceremony on Manit Day, a public
   holiday observed on the last Friday of September. Activities take place
   in the capital city of Majuro and include performances by Marshallese
   singers and dancers, feasts, traditional storytelling, and
   demonstrations of basket weaving and cooking. More... Discuss

The "From Hell" Letter

   In 1888, several women were murdered in the East End section of London
   and mutilated in ways that suggested the culprit had substantial
   anatomical knowledge. Authorities received hundreds of letters
   regarding the murders, including a number of taunting notes purportedly
   from the killer himself—"Jack the Ripper." However, many of the letters
   were believed to be hoaxes. One of the few notes thought to be

Mark Rothko (1903)

   Largely self-taught, Rothko was an American painter who became a
   leading exponent of a uniquely personal strain within the larger
   movement of abstract expressionism. By 1950, he was creating his
   so-called color-field paintings, works with large rectangles of color
   that express moods. In 1970, he committed suicide shortly after
   completing what some regard as his masterwork, a group of murals for a
   chapel in Houston, Texas. For what record-breaking price did one of
   Rothko's paintings sell in 2007? More... Discuss

Marshall Islands Lutok Kobban Alele

   The inhabitants of the Marshall Islands have long kept a tradition
   centered on the alele, a soft-sided basket handmade from the native
   pandanus plant. "Lutok Kobban Alele" is a weeklong festival that honors
   the basket as a national symbol and celebrates Marshallese culture in
   general, concluding with an official ceremony on Manit Day, a public
   holiday observed on the last Friday of September. Activities take place
   in the capital city of Majuro and include performances by Marshallese
   singers and dancers, feasts, traditional storytelling, and
   demonstrations of basket weaving and cooking. More... Discuss

The Boyars

   The boyars were members of the upper nobility in Russia from the 10th
   through the 17th century. Their military support of the Kievan princes
   initially earned them influence and government posts, but soon land
   ownership became the main source of their power and prestige. The
   boyars continued to advise the prince through a council, but as the
   Moscow grand princes consolidated their power, their influence was
   gradually eroded until which czar abolished the rank and title of
   boyar? More... Discuss
