Want to know more about our service?

What happens in the online video consultation?

   Just like in a physical consultation, the online doctor will discuss
   your symptoms. As it's a video consultation, they can also take a look
   at any affected areas, or listen out for symptoms. Where medication is
   needed for you to get better, the GP can issue a prescription.

How do I get a prescription?

   See a GP online in minutes

   Create an account or sign into your existing account, then book an
   appointment on a day and time to suit you.
   Get the help and advice you need

   Ask all of the questions on your mind, and if appropriate, your GP will
   prescribe medication during your consultation.
   Pick up from your local pharmacy

   Collect your prescription and medication from your designated pharmacy
   the very same day, sometimes even within the hour.

What do I need to do at the pharmacy?

   Let the pharmacist know you’re picking up a private prescription from
   Push Doctor.
   As your prescription has been issued privately, you’ll need to pay for
   your medication. However, this cost is often cheaper than an NHS
   prescription.

What does sharing medical records with my GP do?

   This account option determines whether or not our doctors are able to
   share their notes, or any returned letters or test results, with
   offline doctors to continue your care.

   Book appointment How it works

About Push Doctor

   Push Doctor are the leading light in online consultations, providing
   video appointments with NHS-trained GPs to patients across the UK,
   entirely on their terms. Patients can book an appointment online, or
   through the app, and be seen wherever they feel comfortable, whenever
   suits them – either through a partnering NHS surgery or privately.

   Sign up, pick a day and time that works best for you – even the very
   same day – then, when it's nearly time for your appointment, open Push
   Doctor with ID at the ready and wait for your doctor to connect with
   you. Video consultations are just like face-to-face consultations. Your
   doctor will still discuss your symptoms with you, they can still look
   at affected areas with your device's camera, listen out for telltale
   signs using your microphone, and provide prescriptions, referral
   letters and fit notes when necessary.

   Some of the conditions we treat most frequently include mental health
   and skin conditions, infections, joint pain and common complaints like
   colds, flu, asthma, tonsillitis, sinusitis and gastroenteritis and
   irritable bowel syndrome.

   Our service is regulated by the Care Quality Commission, who awarded us
   the UK's first digital healthcare 'good' rating in our last inspection.
   Every one of our doctors is an NHS' 'Top Performer', registered with
   the General Medical Council, so you can never be in doubt that you are
   receiving the best possible care.

   This is the future of healthcare, and it's available right now.
