    1. APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
       Please read this Privacy Policy carefully - by visiting the Site or
       using the Chartbeat service (the "Service"), you confirm that you
       have read about and understand our use and processing of your
       personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
       If you are a Customer using the Service, this Privacy Policy is a
       part of Our Terms of Service. "Terms of Service" as used herein
       shall refer to Our online terms of use as well as the terms of any
       master service agreement or other agreement governing use of the
       Service. Customers agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and to
       have read and understood this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms

       meanings set forth in the Terms of Service. Any order forms or
       additional agreements to which Customers agree governing the

       This Privacy Policy only addresses activities on Our Site and
       Service.
    2. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
       If We change this Privacy Policy and seek to use personal
       information which has already been collected and stored by Us in a
       manner which is different from that stated at the time of
       collection, We will either notify the relevant website visitors
       and/or Customers via e-mail or otherwise in some manner through the
       Site or Service.
       If We make any material changes in Our privacy practices that do
       not affect personal information already collected and stored by Us,
       We will post a notice on Our Site notifying users and/or Customers
       of the change.
    3. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT.
       We use the information We collect from Chartbeat Site Visitors ,
       Chartbeat Customers, and Customer Visitors to create a secure and
       personalized service.
       a. Chartbeat Site Visitors (which includes Customers who visit the
       Site)
       For Chartbeat Site Visitors, We collect and store Site use data,
       such as IP address and browser type, and We use analytics services
       which set and collect cookie IDs for purposes of understanding
       Chartbeat Site Visitors' loyalty to the Site. We use the IP
       addresses to assist in login and other uses related to use of the
       Service. Chartbeat Site Visitors sessions on Our Site are also
       tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user
       trends.
       We may also collect user ID and password information to enable
       returning Chartbeat Site Visitors to log into the Site.
       Finally, Chartbeat Site Visitors may provide personal information
       to us in order to download marketing materials, or in order to
       opt-in to receive marketing emails. Chartbeat Site Visitors can
       opt-out of marketing emails at any time by utilizing the
       unsubscribe links provided therein.
       b. Customers (those who use the Chartbeat Product)
       For Customers specifically, We collect and store personal
       information that Our Customers submit to Us, such as their names
       and e-mail addresses and billing information, to allow Us to
       identify Customers, provide the Service and notify Customers of
       changes or updates to the Service.
       If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the
       Customer’s phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the
       Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other
       scenarios.
       We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP
       address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Customers to
       assist in login and other uses related to Customers’ use of the
       Service. Customers’ sessions on Our Site are also tracked for
       systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may
       link IP address and other information to a Customer's account.
       We also collect Customers’ user ID and password information to
       enable them to log into and use the Service.
       Finally, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing
       emails from us when they register for the Service. Customers can
       opt-out of marketing emails by utilizing the unsubscribe links
       provided therein, but We may still need to send Customers e-mails
       relating to their accounts.
       c. Customer Visitors (individuals who visit publisher ‘s websites)
       For Customer Visitors, when a Customer Visitor visits a Customer
       Website, We collect certain information regarding their use of the
       Customer Website, such as their IP address and browser type on
       behalf of our Customer. Their session on the Customer Website will
       be tracked. We may use their IP address to identify the general
       geographic area from which they are accessing the Customer Website.
       We remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not
       store IP addresses or link IP addresses to any personal
       information. We also use this information for systems
       administration purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends
       in connection with Our provision of the Service.
       As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic
       on the Customer Websites ("Traffic Data") on which Customers choose
       to activate the Service. In connection with the collection of this
       Traffic Data, Chartbeat does not collect any personal information
       from Customer Visitors, (i) so long as the Customer configures the
       Chartbeat code on the Customer Website in accordance with the
       instructions and documentation provided by Us, so that URLs
       containing personal information of Customer Visitors are not
       captured by the Service, and (ii) provided that We do collect IP
       addresses from Customer Visitors in order to show geolocation
       information but We remove the last octet of the IP address and
       therefore do not store IP addresses in a manner that would permit
       personal identification.
       Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics
       and uptime monitoring. We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data
       with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other
       functionality, but We will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic
       Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or
       Customer Website without the Customer’s express prior consent.
       We also collect first party cookie IDs on behalf of Customers.
       Chartbeat code, by default, sets and reads a cookie on the
       Customer's website domain containing a randomly-generated user ID
       for purposes of determining unique visitor counts and visitors'
       loyalty to a site. Such information can be classified as personal
       information under the European General Data Protection Regulation
       but it is not stored in a manner that would permit personal
       identification.
       We also collect and use browser header information to help Us
       understand from which websites a Customer Visitor navigates to a
       Customer Website.
       Our Customers are required to: (a) make appropriate disclosures
       using the Customer's privacy policy or via statements on the
       Customer's website(s); and (b) obtain all Customer Visitors'
       consent to the use of cookies, if applicable, as required by law.
       Chartbeat is not and shall not be liable for any collection or use
       of personal information of Customer Visitors due to a Customer’s
       placement of the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website not in
       accordance with Chartbeat’s instructions or documentation.
    4. OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
       We consider that the legal bases for using your personal
       information as set out in this Privacy Policy are as follows:
       a. Chartbeat Site Visitors
       Our use of your personal information is necessary:
         1. to perform Our obligations in connection with the Terms of Use
            which Customers accept by using the Service; or
         2. for Our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of
            others (for example, to ensure the security of Our Site). Our
            legitimate interests are to: (i) run, grow and develop Our
            business; (ii) operate our Site; (iii) analyze the use of Our
            Site and make improvements; (iv) identify visitors, administer
            the Service; (v) make product decisions; (vi) notify visitors
            of changes or updates to the Site; (vii) for systems
            administration purposes; and (viii) to track visitor trends.
       b. Customers
       Our use of your personal information is necessary:
         1. to perform Our obligations in connection with the Terms of Use
            which you accept by using the Service and/or to comply with
            Our contract to provide Services to you or (if you are an
            employee of a Customer) your employer; or
         2. for Our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of
            others (for example to ensure the security of Our Site). Our
            legitimate interest are to: (i) run, grow and develop Our
            business; (ii) operate Our Site; (iii) allow Us to identify
            Customers; (iv) provide the Service; (v) notify Customers of
            changes or updates to the Service; (vi) contact you in account
            recovery and other scenarios; (viii) assist in login and other
            uses related to Customers’ use of the Service; (ix) perform
            systems administration activities; (x) track visitor trends;
            (xi) enable you to log into and use the Service; (xii) send
            marketing emails; (xiii) send account related emails.
         3. If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal
            information in a particular way, but you later change your
            mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us at
            privacy@chartbeat.com and we will stop doing so. However, if
            you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us
            to be able to provide Our Services
       c. Customer Website Visitors
       We are processors of information about Customer Visitors and
       therefore are not strictly required to provide information about
       the legal basis on which We use personal information of Customer
       Visitors. Accordingly, if you are a Customer Visitor, you should
       check the privacy policy of the website that you are visiting and
       that is being operated by Our Customer. Section 3 (c) above
       describes how we process information on behalf of Our Customers.
       If We rely on Our legitimate interests for using personal
       information, We will undertake a balancing test to ensure that Our
       legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or
       fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the
       personal information. You can ask Us for information on this
       balancing test by contacting us at privacy@chartbeat.com.
    5. ONWARD TRANSFER - DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES
       Except as expressly set out in this Privacy Policy, We will not
       sell, lease or exchange the personal information relating to: (i)
       Chartbeat Site Visitors; (ii) Our Customers; or (iii) Customer
       Visitors (to the extent that we obtain personal information), to
       third parties without first obtaining express consent, unless
       permitted or required by law.
       a. Traffic Data
       For Customers and Customer Visitors, We may aggregate and anonymize
       Traffic Data with that from Our other Customers to provide
       benchmarking data and other functionality, but we will not disclose
       aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a
       Customer or a Customer Website without the Customer’s express prior
       consent.
       b. Agents, vendors and service providers
       For all types of personal information (from Chartbeat Site
       Visitors, Customers and Customer Visitors ), We employ other
       companies and people to perform tasks on Our behalf and may need to
       share personal information with them to provide Our products and
       services. Examples include billing, technical assistance, and
       customer service. Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy
       protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Chartbeat’s
       agents do not have any right to use the personal information we
       share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Any agent
       that we share your personal information with must agree, via
       contract, to provide adequate protections for the personal
       information that are no less protective than those set out in this
       policy.
       c. Business Transfers
       Chartbeat may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of
       transactions, information about Customers as well as aggregated and
       anonymized data is typically one of the business assets that is
       transferred. Moreover, if Chartbeat, or substantially all of its
       assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets
       that is reviewed and transferred or acquired by a third party. You
       acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
       Chartbeat may continue to use your personal information as set
       forth in this Privacy Policy.
       d. Public authorities and compliance with law
       Chartbeat may be required to disclose personal information in
       response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to
       meet national security or law enforcement requirements, prevent
       illegal activity, or comply with any legal obligation.
       e. Enforce Our Terms of Use and agreements
       We may disclose your personal information to third parties in order
       to enforce or apply Our Terms of Service,or any other agreement or
       to respond to any claims, to protect Our rights or the rights of a
       third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any
       illegal activity.
       f. Protect rights and property
       We may disclose your personal information to protect the rights,
       property, or safety of Chartbeat, Our staff, Our Customers or other
       persons. This may include exchanging personal information with
       other organizations for the purposes of fraud protection.
       In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss
       individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy
       Shield, Chartbeat remains potentially liable if third party
       processing personal information received from the European Union or
       Switzerland on its behalf processes that personal information in a
       manner which is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles
       (unless Chartbeat can prove that it is not responsible for the
       event giving rise to the damage).
    6. HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
       We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for
       the purposes for which the personal information is processed. The
       length of time for which We retain personal information depends on
       the purposes for which We collect and use it and/or as required to
       comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend
       Our legal rights.
       Except as required by applicable laws or in order to defend any
       actual or possible legal claims, We will take reasonable steps to
       return or irretrievably delete all personal data processed on
       behalf of Our Customers when it is no longer required to exercise
       or perform Our rights or obligations under Our Terms of Service,
       and in any event within 90 days of expiry or termination of Our
       Terms of Service.
    7. CHOICE, ACCESS AND YOUR RIGHTS
       a.Your Authorization Required
       Whether you are a Chartbeat Site Visitor, a Customer or a Customer
       Visitor, We will not use or share your personal information other
       than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as you have explicitly
       authorized, without obtaining your consent.
       If at any time We would like to disclose your personal information
       to a third party in a manner not described above, We will provide
       you with an affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice. To limit the
       use and disclosure of your personal information, you may also
       submit a written opt-out request to privacy@chartbeat.com. Customer

       are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when
       they register for the Service. Customers may choose not to receive
       marketing emails from Us and can opt out of such e-mails by
       utilizing the unsubscribe links provided therein.
       In addition, you have certain rights in relation to your personal
       information. If you would like further information in relation to
       these or would like to exercise any of them, please contact Us via
       email at at privacy@chartbeat.com at any time.
       Please note that We do not retain IP addresses, browser information
       or header information relating to Customer Visitors for more than a
       temporary period of time in order to provide the Service, and as
       such, that information cannot be accessed or modified once deleted.
       You have the following rights; however, if you are Customer
       Visitor, except as may otherwise be set forth below, you must
       exercise these by contacting the Customer which operates the
       Customer Website that you are visiting and which gives rise to your
       right to exercise:
       c. Right of access.
       You have a right of access to any personal information We hold
       about you. You can ask Us (or if you are a Customer Visitor, the
       Customer which operates the Customer Website that you are visiting)
       for a copy of your personal information; confirmation as to whether
       your personal information is being used by Us; details about how
       and why it is being used; and details of the safeguards which are
       in place if We transfer your information outside of the United
       Kingdom or the European Economic Area ("EEA").
       d. Right to update your information.
       You have a right to request an update to any of your personal
       information which is out of date or incorrect.

       Customer Visitor, the Customer which operates the Customer Website
       that you are visiting) for further information on these specific
       circumstances. When applicable, contact Us at
       privacy@chartbeat.com.
       We will pass your request onto other recipients of your personal
       information unless that is impossible or involves disproportionate
       effort. You can ask Us who the recipients are, by contacting us at
       privacy@chartbeat.com.
       f. Right to restrict use of your information

       certain specific circumstances. You can ask Us (or if you are a
       Customer Visitor, the Customer which operates the Customer Website
       that you are visiting) for further information on these specific
       circumstances. Contact Us at privacy@chartbeat.com.
       We will pass your request onto other recipients of your personal
       information unless that is impossible or involves disproportionate
       effort. You can ask Us who the recipients are by contacting us at
       privacy@chartbeat.com.
       g. Right to stop marketing
       You have a right to ask Us to stop using your personal information
       for direct marketing purposes. If you exercise this right, We will

       event, we do not use Customer Visitor personal information for this
       purpose
       h. Right data portability
       You have a right to ask Us to provide your personal information to
       a third party provider of services.
       This right only applies where We use your personal information on

       Our use of your information is carried out by automated means.
       i. Right to object
       You have a right to ask Us to consider any valid objections which
       you have to Our use of your personal information where We process

       We will consider all such requests and provide Our response within
       a reasonable period (and in any event within one month of your
       request unless We tell you We are entitled to a longer period under
       applicable law). Please note, however, that certain personal
       information may be exempt from such requests in certain
       circumstances, for example if We need to keep using the information
       to comply with Our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise
       or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, We will tell you
       this when responding to your request. We may request you provide Us
       with information necessary to confirm your identity before
       responding to any request you make. Further, if you are Customer
       Visitor, you may be required to make your request by contacting the
       Customer which operates the Customer Website that you are visiting
       and which gives rise to your request.
    8. COOKIES
       Like many other websites, We use a standard technology called
       "cookies."
       Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive.
       They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more
       convenient.
       a. Our site
       As set forth above, we may use cookies in connection with third
       party services to run analytics on Our Site.
       b. Customers
       Cookies allow Customers to login without entering their user ID and
       password each time they use the Service.
       c. Customers' websites
       We also use cookies on Customer Websites; these cookies help Us
       understand how Customer Visitors interact with those Customer
       Websites. Cookies also allow Us to improve the Service.
       If a Customer does not allow the placement of Chartbeat cookies on
       its Customer Website, the “new vs. returning user” data point in
       its Chartbeat dashboard will not be accurately reported. If you
       choose to remove Chartbeat cookies, please refer to the
       documentation for your browser.
       d. Disabling cookies
       Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature,
       which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well
       as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software)
       allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a
       variety of ways. If a Customer disables cookies, it will not be
       able to use the data tracking capabilities of the Service.
       e. For Our European Customers where the EU ePrivacy Directive
       applies:
       Chartbeat uses two cookies. One cookie (_chartbeat2) is used to
       register whether a Customer Visitor has visited the Customer
       Website before (to calculate “new vs returning” users). The other
       (_SUPERFLY_nosample) is used only if a Customer exceeds its plan’s
       traffic limit. When the traffic limit is reached the cookie is set
       and will disable the beacon from that Customer for one hour. The
       chartbeat2 cookie will remain valid as to any given website
       visitor, until the visitor elects to disable it. The
       SUPERFLY_nosample cookie is valid for one hour.
    9. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
       Our Site may contain links to third party websites. Please be aware
       that We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third
       party websites you choose to visit. If you provide any personal
       information directly to parties other than Us, different rules may
       apply to the use or disclosure of that personal information. We
       encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing
       your personal information to third parties.
   10. Third party advertisers
       We may choose to deploy advertising on the Site and Service that is
       delivered to Chartbeat Visitors and Customers through a third
       party's advertising server. Information about Chartbeat Visitors
       and Customers' use of Our Service, such as the number of times a
       visitor has viewed an ad (but no personal information of the user),
       would be used in such a scenario to serve ads to Chartbeat Visitors
       and Customers.
   11. VOLUNTARY PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
       Please be aware that whenever one voluntarily discloses personal
       information online - e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in
       file uploads, through events, etc. - that information becomes
       public and can be collected and used by others and indexed in
       search engines. We have no control over, and take no responsibility
       for, the use, storage or dissemination of such publicly disclosed
       personal information. By posting personal information online in
       public forums, users may receive unsolicited messages from other
       parties.
       If you log on to our Site or Service through a social networking
       site (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we may receive personal or
       anonymous data about you from that site, in accordance with the
       terms of use and privacy policy of that site. We may add this
       information to the information we have already collected from you
       via the Site or Service.
   12. PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN
       In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
       (COPPA) and applicable European data privacy laws, We do not
       knowingly provide access to the Service to persons under the age of
       eighteen (18). If We learn that any user of the Service is under
       the age of eighteen (18), We will take appropriate steps to remove
       that user's information from Our records and We will restrict that
       individual from future access to the Service. Please contact us at
       privacy@chartbeat if you are aware that we may have inadvertently
       collected personal information from a child.
   13. SECURITY
       We have implemented security measures to protect information from
       loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices
       such as encrypted storage, firewalls and password protection
       systems to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information
       which is collected and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
       Each of Our employees and agents are aware of Our security
       policies; personal information is only available to those employees
       and agents who need it to perform their jobs.

       We process all personal information in facilities in the United
       States. Personal information is either collected in the United
       States, obtained through websites which are hosted in the United
       States, or transferred to the United States from websites which are
       hosted outside of the United States.
       Regardless of where the personal information comes from, it is

       privacy protection as described herein.
