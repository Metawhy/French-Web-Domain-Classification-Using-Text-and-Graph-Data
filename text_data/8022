Four Best Portable BBQs For 4×4 Camping Trips – Top Outdoor Adventure Designs

   Aussies love their BBQs so much that we even take them camping with us!
   But don’t worry about manhandling your old BBQ into the back of your
   4WD, because there are some really great portable options on the market
   that are ideal for camping and very affordable.

   If you are wondering about storing these portable BBQs in the back of
   your Ute or 4WD, then again you don’t need to worry, because you can
   simply install a 4×4 BBQ slide and you will be good to go. So let’s
   look at some of these portable BBQs and why they might be perfect for
   your next camping trip.

Zimba Lotus Grill

   If you want a smokeless BBQ grill, then check out this number by Zimba.
   It’s the perfect size for storing in the back of your 4WD on a 4×4 BBQ
   slide and it’s very easy to keep clean. It operates by using charcoal
   packed inside a canister that’s lit with lighter fluid. You simply
   place the canister inside the grill and under the grill plate, where a
   battery powered fan heats the charcoal, and Bob’s your uncle! One
   awesome, smokeless BBQ to order! If it’s knocked over, nothing spills
   except the food, because the charcoal and lighter fluid are kept safe
   inside the canister, and since it’s double walled, it’s not too hot to
   pick up or stand on your picnic table.

Jamie Oliver Big Boy BBQ

   Even if it was useless, this Big Boy BBQ is a joy to behold!
   Thankfully, it’s a great piece of kit that uses charcoal for cooking,
   has a curved grill that prevents food from falling onto the coals, and
   with a decent size grill, it’s big enough for steak, burgers or
   sausages for a family of four. This is a tough little BBQ that has an
   adjustable ventilation system and easily fits on top of a bench or
   looks just as good on your patio at home.

Ziegler & Brown Portable Grill

   Available in fire engine red, black or charcoal grey, this portable
   grill operates on LP gas and with a high roll-back hood can cook
   anything from steaks, chops, sausages and burgers to whole chickens and
   the Sunday roast. The hood can be twisted right underneath the grill,
   it’s easy to clean and you can buy accessories for it: hot plate, stand
   and a trivet kit. Storing it in the back of your 4WD won’t be a
   problem, just install a deep enough drawer and a 4×4 BBQ slide to give
   you easy access.

Gasmate Rio BBQ

   Image from https://www.catch.com.au/

   If you want a non-stick BBQ with a large cooking area that is easy to
   clean, comes with both ribbed and flat hotplates, and operates on LP
   gas, then this little number has your name on it. The hood even
   includes a heat gauge with temperature controls for BBQ connoisseurs,
   detachable drip tray, rotary ignition, cool-to-touch handle, and it’s
   ready to go in seconds. You can use it as a table-top BBQ or place it
   on the stand that’s provided, but however you use it, it’s an outdoor
   grill with all the bells and whistles – just don’t forget the 4×4 BBQ
   slide and you are all set for the best camping trip ever!

Simple but Helpful Nutrition Rules to Become Stronger and Build Muscle

   What a person eats has a major impact on appearance. This is why
   bodybuilders must have a dedicated nutritionist who will consistently
   guide them on what to eat. Any person can, however, enhance his or her
   physical looks by observing some helpful nutrition rules.

   simple-but-helpful-nutrition-rules-to-build-muscle-for-your-work-out-mo
   tivation1

   Image from https://greatist.com/

   Although other factors like exercise and europe steroids will play a
   role in physical appearance, the main influencer is diet. It is the
   source of energy for exercise and the promotion of growth in body
   cells. Follow these rules to succeed in your efforts.

Include Proteins in All Meals

   Whether you are having a snack or a main meal, it is crucial that you
   include a substantial amount of protein to promote cell growth.
   Understanding and utilizing the right portion size of foods with
   protein per meal is an even better way to facilitate faster growth. It
   is for this reason that a person must consult and research on exactly
   what is necessary to include. Diversifying the protein sources is
   important to allow intake of all important amino acids.

Eat Breakfast

   Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for two reasons. Number
   one is the fact that you are concluding a long period without eating
   anything, and number two is the fact that you need the right amount of
   certain foods to support you throughout the day. Breakfast should
   include all important categories of food namely proteins, carbohydrates
   and vitamins. Fluids like fresh juices also play an important role in
   hydrating the body.

Have Frequent Meals

   People with the aim of increasing strength and muscles should consider
   eating frequent meals rather than just three meals. This is where one
   must include a well-planned snack between all the meals. While most
   people will not have problems with main meals, snacks are challenging.
   However, including things like yogurt, nuts and protein bars will solve
   the problem. Frequent meals give your body the nutrients it requires to
   start growing strong and increase muscle size.

Whole Foods Are Better

   There is a great emphasis on the idea that people should eat whole food
   at all times. Processed food compromises on numerous nutrients that
   promote cell growth. Whole food contains these missing nutrients and
   aids in digestion and assimilation of these nutrients. Cells and the
   bones become healthy because of such nutrients.

Drinking Water

   Keeping the body hydrated is very crucial for people who want to become
   stronger. We all know that over 70 percent of a human body is made of
   water. This is why we must keep it hydrated. Cells are likely to grow
   better if there is enough water in the body.

   If you have ever been engaged in strength training, you will agree that
   a well-hydrated body has a higher chance of performing better. It is
   water that also supports ideal metabolism and other activities of the
   body.

   Conclusion

   With the help of the above simple nutritional tips, the majority of
   people who use them well will succeed. The tips have been proven to
   work well when applied consistently and in the right way. You may have
   to gather some finer details to increase the chances of success.

4 Vacation Ideas for the Foodies – How to Save Money For Your Tourism Budget

   Foodies believe that eating well and travelling well always go hand in
   hand. People who love food always hunt for the best food destinations
   in the places they visit. They’re either looking for the tapas in
   Barcelona or the sauerkraut soup in Prague or the sushi in Tokyo.
   Foodies think in terms of food. While there are many who plan a
   vacation on several themes like fun, sun amusement parks, landmarks or
   even snorkelling, there are many who plan vacations around a specific
   theme. You must have noticed that whenever you return from a trip, the
   first thing that people ask you is how the food way.

   While you have already uploaded the pictures on Instagram after editing
   them with a photo editor like https://www.movavi.com/photo-editor/,

   updated on them. So, if you’re a foodie who travels the globe in search
   of all the foodie destinations, you’ve clicked on the right post. Here
   are some of the best destinations for foodies.

   Destination #1: Barcelona, Spain

   If you haven’t been to Barcelona, you will not know that most of the
   food items that you find here comprise of basically 3 ingredients –
   garlic, olive oil and tomato. Is this too surprising a fact for a
   Mediterranean country like Barcelona? The place is also extremely
   popular for the seafood due its closeness to the ocean. The cuisine in
   Barcelona is mainly influenced by the Mediterranean countries like
   France, Italy, Morocco and Greece. Some of the most popular foods are
   based on garlic or nuts and pine or garlic allioli where the yolk of an
   egg is also added to the texture.

   Destination #2: Chengdu, China

   Are you someone who is simply blown out by Chinese food? If answered
   yes, you should visit the capital of the Sichuan province, Chengdu.
   This is a specific area which is well known for its cuisine and it has
   also taken a lead in shaping various influences. In this cuisine, you
   will mainly find meals based on vegetables and they will reflect the
   vegetarian culture of Buddhism. Due to the fact that this region uses
   oxen, you will also find a lot of beef in the area.

   breathtaking views of the Andes. They include as much wine as you wish
   to drink.

   Destination #4: New Orleans

   It goes without saying that this is home to Creole and Cajun cuisine.
   New Orleans is called the Crescent City and they share a deep and
   vibrant relation with food, just as you share with music. The cuisine
   in New Orleans has Caribbean, French and African influences. During
   your trip to New Orleans, the best thing is that you’ll be able to eat
   the best food without breaking your bank or busting your travel budget.
   Ask the locals where you can get inexpensive and authentic food. The
   po’boy sandwiches are popular in New Orleans and you shouldn’t miss
   them at all.

   Hence, if you’re a foodie who is traveling, keep the above listed
   destinations in your bucket list so that you can enjoy the food along
   with the adventure of the places.
