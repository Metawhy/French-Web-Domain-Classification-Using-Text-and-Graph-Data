       Targeting TB Persistence

Targeting TB Persistence
       Tuberculosis (TB) is notoriously difficult to eradicate, in large
       part because infections caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium
       tuberculosis (Mtb) enter into a persistent state. In a study
       published online on September 16 in Nature Communications, Michael

Application Deadline and Fee

Apply

   To apply to the Einstein PhD Program visit:
   https://biomedcas.liaisoncas.com.

   International applicants: We are unable to take international students
   into the PhD program for the 2019-2020 application cycle. Therefore,
   international applicants should not submit a PhD application.

Deadline

   The Einstein PhD application deadline is December 11, 2019

What is BioMedCAS?

   BioMedCAS is a centralized application service through which
   prospective PhD students can apply to biomedical graduate programs in
   the United States. This pilot project is run in coordination with
   participating institutions, BioGAP, and Liaison.

   BioMedCAS Logo

   The goal of this pilot is to:
    1. determine if BioMedCAS can streamline the application process for
       applicants, recommenders, and the graduate programs
    2. help grow and build our understanding of PhD biomedical science
       applicants as they enter the biomedical workforce
    3. guide and support applicants as they begin their career in the
       biomedical sciences

Academic Requirements

   Applicants to the Einstein Graduate Programs in the Biomedical Sciences
   must:
     * be in the final year of an undergraduate curriculum, or already
       hold a Bachelor's degree or Master's degree from a college or
       university of recognized standing, or present evidence of an
       equivalent education.
     * have successfully completed undergraduate courses in biology,
       general chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics (including
       calculus), and physics, with advanced electives in biology,
       chemistry, and/or physics (a course in biochemistry is strongly
       recommended); or have successfully completed your college's major
       in biology, chemistry, physics or similar science; or have
       successfully completed an undergraduate engineering curriculum
     * have had a sustained research experience

Supporting Materials

   In addition to the online application, all Ph.D. applicants must submit
   the following supporting materials:

Personal Statement

   Your Personal Statement gives us the opportunity to learn about you as
   an individual.
   You should briefly describe your past research experience, including
   the problems you have studied, the results and any conclusions. You may
   also discuss the factors which motivated your interest in graduate
   study in the biomedical sciences and your long-range career plans.

   You should also include any published papers or abstracts, academic
   honors of fellowships or awards, and if you have presented your work at
   scientific meetings.

   Please limit your statement to 1000 words.

Curriculum Vitae (C.V.)

   A curriculum vitae is a detailed document which includes a summary of
   your educational and academic backgrounds as well as research
   experiences, publications, presentations, awards, honors, affiliations
   and other details.

Letters of Recommendation

   Three letters of recommendation are required. They must be submitted
   online (i.e., electronically) as part of your online application.
   Letters should be obtained from individuals with direct knowledge of
   your academic and scientific qualifications for graduate study.

Transcripts

   A transcript or academic record is required from each college or
   university you attended. You should upload a scanned copy of your
   transcript or academic record to your application for each institution
   prior to submitting it. Please check that uploaded transcript(s) are
   legible). Unofficial copies of your transcript or academic record are
   acceptable.

   Applicants who have attended international institutions, whose
   transcripts are in a language other than English, should upload the
   original transcript and the certified English translation to your
   on-line application.

TOEFL Scores

   Applicants from countries where English is not the primary language
   must take the TOEFL examination. International applicants who have
   completed an undergraduate degree either in the United States or in an
   English-speaking country do not need to take the TOEFL exam. The school
   code is 2997; a departmental code is not necessary.

Interviews

   Competitive applicants will be invited to campus for an interview
   visit. Interview visit dates occur late-January to early-March.

   When Einstein opened its doors in 1955, the New York Times was already
   noting that “the new medical school’s distinguished and talented
   faculty assured the institution of a place in the ranks of the great
   medical schools in the world. Einstein’s history of scientific
   innovation and storied culture of collaboration fosters excellence in
   scientific research.

   The discoveries and life’s work by Einstein faculty and Einstein PhD
   alumni have been recognized with prestigious awards, including the
   membership in academies such as the National Academy of Science, The
   Presidential Medal of Science, and the MacArthur Foundation.
     * National Academy of Sciences Members
     * National Medal of Science Recipients
     * Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators
     * American Academy of Arts and Sciences
     * MacArthur Fellows

National Academy of Sciences

   Members are elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition
   of their distinguished and continuing achievements in original
   research. Membership is a widely accepted mark of excellence in science
   and is considered one of the highest honors that a scientist can
   receive.

Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators

   Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigators, widely known for
   their creativity and productivity, push the bounds of knowledge in
   biomedical research. HHMI investigators have support to follow their
   ideas through to fruition, even if that process takes a very long time.
   HHMI's philosophy of selecting “people, not projects” selects
   researchers who bring innovative approaches to the study of biological
   problems.
