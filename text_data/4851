"Love Notes" Embellishments

   The fortunate thing about having a lot of extra ready-to-use stock
   items in my files is that it can be much easier to make a few things
   than it might otherwise be.
   My eyes need extensive rest at times since my optic nerve health to one
   eye became problematic this past Labor Day weekend. This will be my
   first truly New post (nothing like the most recent post that was found
   almost ready to upload) since summer 2017. I'm proud of it, even if it
   cost me in eye strength for the day. I've promised myself to refrain
   from taking further chances. Building things more gradually from now on
   might be one way to keep on creating - but gently.
   All components are from older projects of times past, all of which have
   previously been seen either here or elsewhere online. What I did was to
   combine them for this new project. I think that everything fits
   together pretty well. Red + black + white is a color trio that's often
   used for Valentines Day creating.
   The sheet music is from my own collection, scanned by me and then
   altered. The typewriter was in the Public Domain when I found it some
   while back. As for the phrases chosen, two of those are outtakes from
   the writings of William Shakespeare, while the third one is obviously
   universal.

In the Pink "Extras" for Card-making or Collage

   It's simple, but it's sweet. An unexpected happy find for me in
   time for Valentine's Day creative projects.
   This set I just happened to run across in my searches for another file
   entirely. It only required a little repositioning of the items involved
   to make it into something usable. Such a lucky find is really nice for
   me, as my eye health (a condition known as Optic Neuritis) hasn't been
   good for several months. In fact, this is my only new post here for
   quite a while.
   There are copyrights to be considered for this little one page set of
   "Extras." Please see the Digital Brush credits and follow my red letter
   Guidelines for best use that are listed below. Thank you.
   The original set to which this belongs may be found by following the
   link HERE. There you may see everything from tag blanks to ATC
   Backgrounds and many other collage elements for a number of creative
   purposes. Again, please follow the Guidelines and respect the design
   credits there.
   A final note:
   All digital art brushes used in the making of this pink patterned set
   are by www.obsidiandawn.com except for one  that may no longer be found
   at the source (brusheezy.com).
   Happy Creativity!

Women's Shoes of 1900

   This is a re-post of a prior offering at this blog, the links for which
   are no longer available.
   Aren't these fun to look at? Each one says something about women's
   shoes of the very late Victorian era as it was in the year 1900. I had
   to choose from dozens to make this Collage Set for you. I also improved
   and tidied up the looks of each shoe with background. This is actually
   an older post that I could not find a proper link for owing to
   technical difficulties. I found the image in my files, and have added
   it to storage for you via my Download link below.
   Please see the red Guidelines at the foot of this post. Thank you.

Sapphire Blue September Book Arts Set

   The second of 2 September Book Arts posts...
   ...before I go on a bit of a health hiatus for a while here at the
   Studio.
   The month of September's gemstone is the Sapphire. I chose to use the
   differing tones in the average sapphire as the inspiration for this
   set.
   Please respect my copyrights and follow the red letter Guidelines
   listed at the foot of this post. Thank you.
   The set requires 2 circle punches, one in the 1 inch size, the other in
   the 1/2 inch size. For some examples of how I like to suggest that
   people might use my sets, please follow this link HERE and look for the
   Display.
   Happy September Creativity!

September Set: "Black-Eyed Susans"

   The first of 2 September Book Arts posts...
   ...before I go on a bit of a health hiatus for a while here at the
   Studio.
   The colors that the end of summer brings can be bright and promising.
   This set has been inspired by the flower known as the "black-eyed
   Susan." I love that pleasant blend of golden yellow with a deeper
   orange, don't you? Some "Susans" come in a variety of colors, but I
   prefer this orange-y yellow the best.
   Please respect my copyrights and follow the red letter Guidelines
   listed at the foot of this post. Thank you.
   The set requires 2 circle punches, one in the 1 inch size, the other in

Acrylic Pour ATC Backgrounds in Violet

   I've found a few spare moments for another Friday freebie ATC
   Background set.
   This time, I'm offering my Backgrounds for you to build upon in the
   many varying hues and shades of that mysteriously moody color known as
   violet.
   As already mentioned previously, this began with my second try at using
   the technique known as "Acrylic Pouring" or "Poured Acrylics." The
   "cells" that developed in this small pour are so very tiny that it is
   difficult to view them without a little help. So I took a few pictures
   and then played with those for a little bit using Photoshop. I had to
   zoom in an awful lot before the "cells" could be enjoyed.
   This led to my musing as to how to play with those same photographs I
   had taken of this experiment using acrylic pouring. There have been
   other colors before, among them Aquatic and Fuchsia. These are fairly
   recent posts, so all you have to do is to scroll down just a little bit
   and you'll quickly see them in other posts. I've already offered a duo
   of envelopes with labels to match as well, which you will no doubt find
   on the way down as you scroll.
   Happy weekend creativity!

Castle Coloring Page

   This illustration is of a real castle in France.
   I like medieval artwork and architecture. I also like to "geek out" on
   history now and then, so this illustration really pleased me when I ran
   across it online.
   While I've cleaned it up and resized it, it's still a Public Domain
   image. For more about the Château de Coucy or the Coucy castle, you may
   visit this website HERE. I'm fascinated by it in that I used to reread
   a favorite medieval history book by Barbara Tuchman entitled, "A
   Distant Mirror," that traces the history of the Coucy family. (Please
   do not let anyone fool you - that book is not fictional. I revel in the
   footnotes and appendixes as well as the bibliography. See? I am a
   history nerd or "geek.")
   Happy Coloring Creativity!

ATC Acrylic Pour Background Set: Hot Flash Lava Lamp

   Today's freebie is another color way of the "Acrylic Pour" series of
   ATC Background Sets. This time, the theme is "Hot Flash Lava Lamp."
   As I mentioned previously, this began with my second try at using the
   technique known as "Acrylic Pouring" or "Poured Acrylics." The "cells"
   that developed in this small pour are so very tiny that it is difficult

   This led to my musing as to how to play with some photographs I had
   taken of this experiment using acrylic pouring. There have been 2 other
   colors before, Aquatic and Fuchsia. More recently, I posted one
   entitled, "Peanut Butter and Hot Chili Peppers." These are fairly
   recent posts, so all you have to do is to scroll down just a little bit
   and you'll quickly see them in other posts. I've already offered a duo
   of envelopes with labels to match as well, which you will no doubt find

ATC Sixpack:Acrylic Pour Peanut Butter + Hot Chilis

   For today's Friday freebie, I've gone a bit wild this time by choosing
   today's weird color way for my Acrylic Pour series.
   After all, whoever heard of having hot chili peppers with peanut
   butter? Thai food often will contain a combination of peanuts and spicy
   flavors, so why can't I follow suit?
   :)
   As I mentioned previously, this began with my second try at using the
   technique known as "Acrylic Pouring" or "Poured Acrylics." The "cells"

Free Cinderella Coloring Page

   Cinderella in one of her quieter moments, feeding the little birds
   who've come to pay her a visit.
   This is a favorite story for many people. I love the old style hearth
   that's big enough to sit in. The whole setting is really wonderfully
   done. Though I've seen it in a number of spots online, I thought I'd
   offer my own version for coloring or tinting. I think this project
   would work best using colored pencils, but the choice is yours, of
   course. Don't you simply love her shoes?
