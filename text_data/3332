PRIVACY POLICY

   Effective: June 26, 2018


   Your data and privacy is important to us here at Kik Interactive Inc.
   and our affiliated companies including Kin Ecosystem (collectively,
   “Kik”, “us”, or “we”).  This policy was created to make sure you
   understand the data we collect about you when you use the Kik App
   (“app”) or visit our website at www.kik.com (the “Services”), what we
   do with it, and how it is protected.


   What's New?

   This policy was last updated as of June 26, 2018.  You should read this
   policy and our Terms of Service in full to make sure you understand any
   changes that may be important to you, but the key updates include:
     * updates we’ve made to reflect changes to our Services, including
       the integration of the Kin Marketplace (i.e., the marketplace made
       available by the Kin Ecosystem for discovering opportunities to
       earn and spend Kin currency) into Kik; and
     * changes in the law impacting European Union citizens.

   This policy may be updated from time to time.  Whenever we make
   updates, we will include the date of the most recent modification near
   the top of this page and may provide you with additional notice of
   material changes by, for example, providing you with in-app
   notification.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

   We collect from you directly, when you use our Services, and from third
   parties.

   Information you give us directly. In connection with providing Services
   to you, we collect certain information from you directly, such as:
     * Registration information: when you sign up to use the app, you
       provide us with basic information like your name, username,
       password hash, email address, phone number (optional at
       registration or provided by you later), and birth date.
     * Profile information: such as your individual profile pictures,
       background photo, interests, emoji status, your name (first and/or
       last) and any other information you choose to provide on your
       profile (you may edit and control your profile information
       displayed to other users within the app through user settings and
       preferences).
     * Message content: when you send or receive a message through the
       app, the text you write and any pictures or videos included in your
       message are transmitted through our servers. While we do not store
       the actual text or any of your messages after they have been
       delivered to the intended recipients, attachments such as pictures
       and videos are temporarily stored for deliverability purposes. Once
       you log out of the app, all delivered messages to your device,
       including attachments, will be lost unless you (or the user with
       whom you've been communicating) have saved or backed them up
       outside of the app.
     * Conversation attributes: when you create group or private chats,
       you have the ability to configure certain elements of your
       conversations, including, for example, things like group name,
       group profile picture, themes, administrators, and membership
       limitations.
     * Membership information: when you join or leave a public group, we
       collect that information.
     * Kik communications: when you reach out to us (through, for example,
       in-app reports made by you, emails sent by you to us, or voluntary
       polls, surveys, or questionnaires initiated by us that you respond
       to), we collect and store the content and details of that
       communication, including things like date, time, content and method
       of communication, identity verification information (if applicable)
       and resolution (if applicable). When you voluntarily respond to
       polls, surveys, and questionnaires, the content of personal
       information you provide may include your address and basic
       demographic information.
     * Kin Wallet Information: when you sign up to earn and spend Kin
       currency within the app through the Kin Marketplace, we collect
       information necessary to facilitate transactions involving Kin
       (such as the transaction value and the person with whom you are
       transacting), and create or connect your public wallet address
       ("Kin Wallet Information").

   Information we get when you use  our Services. We collect certain
   information when you use our Services to, for example, send a message,
   join a public group discussion, chat with bots, create a Kin Wallet, or
   participate in the Kin Marketplace. Such information includes things
   like:
     * Log and data usage information: we collect and process a record of
       your activity on our servers. This information may include details
       such as the date and time a message was sent, who you chatted with,
       your internet protocol ("IP") address, and how you use third-party
       websites or services accessed through the app (like GIFs or emojis
       you use in app or your chats with bots).
     * Device information. We collect information from and about the
       device you use to access our Services, which may include
       information like your hardware model, operating system version,
       unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
     * Location information: based on your IP address, we may collect
       information about your general geographical location (which may
       identify you as being in a particular city or state), but we do not
       use GPS or similar methods to collect information about your
       precise location.
     * Device contacts/address book: when you give us permission to access
       your device's contacts or address book to use certain Services
       (such as "find a friend"), we may collect information from your
       device's contacts/address book such as email addresses and phone
       numbers.
     * Bot chats: when you chat with Bots, we may collect details about
       your chats such as date and time, frequency, and content of your
       chats (you should be aware that we only collect the content of your
       chats with bots for the limited purposes of debugging and improving
       the functionality of the Kik bot platform).
     * Kik Code: When you scan a Kik Code (to facilitate the delivery of
       goods or obtain coupons for example), information about you may be
       inferred based on the Kik Code itself and where it was displayed.
       For example, if you scan a Kik Code located at a particular
       restaurant, that might indicate that you visited a particular
       restaurant and enjoy that cuisine.
     * Kin transaction information: when you choose to earn and spend Kin
       within the app through the Kin Marketplace, we collect and process
       a record of your transactions. Such information may include things
       like the date and time of a transaction, information identifying
       your account information and the account you are transacting with.
       Transaction information may also include your public wallet
       address, balance, transaction history, and blockchain transaction
       identifiers (such as the transaction hash), the public wallet
       address of payors and payees. You should be aware that when you
       earn and spend Kin, your blockchain transactions will be publicly
       visible to anyone who has access to the blockchain.
     * Cookie information: we may collect information stored or recognized
       on your computer or mobile phone about things like your website
       activity and/or browser or device information through the use of
       cookies and similar technologies like web beacons.
     * Local storage information: we may collect and/or store information
       such as photos or videos with an option to download locally on your
       device through things like browser web storage (including HTML5)
       and application data caches.

   Information we get from Third Parties. We may collect information about
   your from other users, our partners, and third parties as more fully
   detailed below:
     * User reports: when another user flags a conversation and reports it
       to us for investigation (alleging violations of our Community
       Standards, for example), we may collect information provided to us
       from the user regarding their complaint, which may include the
       offending chat and any associated pictures or videos.
     * Third party information: we may collect and process information
       about you from third-parties who offer services to you and/or us
       through the app, such as analytics companies who help us do things
       like understand what may have gone wrong in the app that caused
       your app to crash, or companies who offer services that you may
       choose to use (such as GIFs, brand polls, or bots). To the extent
       that you use any of these third-party services through the app, the
       third party's terms and privacy policies govern the use of those
       services.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION

   We mostly use the information we collect about you to carry out the
   Services you have requested from us and to continuously improve your
   in-app experience, but we use the information in other ways too.  Here
   is more detailed explanation of how we use your information:
     * Provide, maintain, and protect your in-app experience and use of
       Services. We use information we collect about you to provide the
       Services you request from us and to provide the functionality of
       the app and the features you choose to use. For example, we use the
       information to deliver your messages, display your intended themes
       and profile images, and allow you to transact in the Kin
       Marketplace.
     * Personalize content. We use the information you provide to us to
       personalize content and make suggestions that are relevant to you
       such as to help you connect with friends.
     * Analyze usage to maintain features that are working well and
       improve and/or develop new features to enhance your in-app
       experience. We aim to continuously improve our offerings to bring
       you the best way to make meaningful connections. Accordingly, we
       are continuously analyzing how users access and use the app and its
       features in order to improve existing Services and develop new
       ones. Our analysis of how you use the app can help us do things
       like evaluate the popularity and functionality of certain features,
       identify and fix potential bugs, and understand what our users
       want.  For example, your Kin Transaction Information helps us: (a)
       evaluate how quickly earning and spending Kin is being verified on
       the blockchain to ensure user satisfaction; and (b) understand what
       earning and spending experiences users prefer so we can give you
       more of what you want.
     * Provide, maintain, and improve the Kin Marketplace. To make sure
       your intended Kin transactions are processed as intended, we use
       your information to, for example, carry out requested transactions,
       provide you with earn and spend opportunities within the Kin
       Marketplace.
     * Communicate with you. The information we collect lets us keep you
       posted on Kik’s latest product announcements, software updates,
       upcoming events and any messages you have waiting on Kik if you
       haven’t been active for a while. If you indicated that you wished
       to receive special offers, and information about services that
       might be of interest to you, Kik may occasionally send you messages
       regarding such offers (like through the Kik Team bot). If you do
       not wish to continue to receive these offers, you can block,
       unsubscribe, or email us at [email protected]. Changes may require
       up to ten business days to take effect.
     * Show and measure services. We may use information to improve our
       offerings and measurement systems so that we can show you relevant
       services that may be of interest to you and measure the
       effectiveness and reach of the services.
     * Promote Safety and Security. We may use your information to verify
       identity, determine eligibility to use the Services, and recommend
       appropriate Services. We also use information for loss prevention,
       anti-fraud, and to enforce our Terms of Service.

HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION

   We may share your information if you ask us to. For example, we send
   the message you asked us to send to another user or within a group
   chat, we display your public profile, and if you post content on social
   networking sites using the Kik app, we provide your content as you’ve
   requested. You should note, however, that the information you choose to
   share on social networking sites is governed by the privacy policy of
   that social networking site and is not covered by this privacy policy;
   and you (not us) will be solely responsible for your use of those
   sites.

   Other than information you’ve asked us to share, we do not share, sell
   or transfer your personal information without your consent, except as
   described below:
     * Third Party products and services on Kik. Certain features you use
       through Kik are offered by third-parties and are marked as such.
       Those features may include things like bots, Kik scan codes, GIFs,
       emojis, smileys, Kin earn and spend offers, web pages optimized for
       Kik, and polls. When you choose to use these third-party features,
       those third-parties (and other users of those third party services)
       may be able to see things like your user profile, content of
       messages you are sharing on bots or web pages, your poll responses,
       your public wallet address, and your approximate location. These
       third-parties may use this information as described in their
       privacy policies, which can include advertising.  You agree that we
       are not responsible for how these third parties collect or use your
       information. We may, from time to time, share non-personal
       aggregated information with third parties.
     * Our service providers. We use third-party service providers to help
       operate our business. Examples include suppliers who host our data
       or provide customer service.  We require all service providers to
       maintain confidentiality. Use of your personal information by our
       service providers is further limited to the information they need
       to provide services on our behalf. For more information about how
       these service providers treat your personal information, contact us
       at the address below.
     * Our related companies. We may share some or all of your information
       with our affiliated companies, subsidiaries, or joint ventures,
       provided that they are subject to and conditioned upon strict
       adherence to this Privacy Policy.
     * To protect Kik and its users, or for legal purposes. We may
       disclose your information:  (a) if we think it’s needed to detect,
       prevent or address illegal activity, or identify, contact or bring
       legal action against someone who appears to be causing injury to or
       interfering with the rights or property of Kik or Kik users; (b) as
       part of a legal matter or investigation, including an investigation
       related to a suspected breach of our Terms of Service; (c) when we
       believe that disclosure is required or permitted by law, including
       when responding to subpoenas, warrants, production orders, or
       similar instruments; or (d) if we believe that disclosure is needed
       to protect your safety or the safety of others, including when
       there is an emergency involving potential harm, loss of security or
       serious injury to people or threats of such emergencies.
     * Merger, financing or sale. We may share your information in
       connection with a merger, financing, acquisition, dissolution
       transaction, bankruptcy or proceeding involving sale, transfer,
       divestiture of all or a portion of our business or assets. If
       another company acquires our business or assets, that company will
       have your information collected by us and will assume the rights
       and obligations regarding your information as allowed by this
       privacy policy.

HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION

   We keep your personal information for different periods of time
   depending on why we collected it and how we use it, but we keep it only
   as long as necessary and relevant for us to provide the Services,
   maintain our legitimate business operations, and/or or meet our legal
   obligations.  For example, once you send a message through the app and
   it has been received by the intended recipients, the text of the
   message is no longer accessible by our servers and will disappear from
   your app when you logout (so be sure to backup any data you want to
   keep); however, attachments to that message (such as pictures or
   videos) are stored for 30 days for deliverability purposes.

   If you decide you no longer want an account with us, you can delete
   your account by submitting a request for deactivation by clicking here.
    Deactivating your account will permanently delete your account.  This
   means, for example, that you won’t get messages or emails from us
   anymore and will not be searchable anywhere on the app.  Once your
   information has been deleted, you will not be able to restore that
   information later. You should be aware that certain information about
   you may still be available on other users’ apps and will not be deleted
   by us.

USER CONTROLS

   You can access and update your information by going to the “Your
   Account” section on Kik. You can also request access, update or correct
   any inaccuracies by clicking here. We may ask you for certain
   information in order to verify your identity.

   You can control access to your device’s camera and storage through your
   device’s settings.

   You can also control information you share with others through in-app
   safety controls which allow you to do things like:
     * block users;
     * report users who are making you uncomfortable or sending spam; and
     * ignore new chats from people you don't know.

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

   We store, use, and maintain your personal information using reasonable
   security measures designed to protect the security of your personal
   information.  Such measures vary depending on the nature of your
   information. For example, your account is protected by the password you
   use to access your Kik account.  It is important that you protect and
   maintain your account’s security and immediately tell us of any
   unauthorized access or use of your account (you can do so by clicking
   here).  When you sign into your account, we also encrypt the
   transmission of your login information between the app and our servers.

   Despite these efforts, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate
   security risks associated with online transmissions.  We cannot
   guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other
   breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your
   information. You are responsible for helping to protect the security of
   your information by having a strong password unique to Kik that you
   keep confidential and protecting your device.

EUROPEAN USERS

   For citizens of the European Union, you should know that Kik is a
   controller and a processor of your personal information.  The legal
   bases for which we collect and use the information described above
   depends on what the information is and why we collected it.  The four
   bases upon which we rely include:
     * Contract. This means we need the information to perform our
       contract with you.  For example, when you want to send a message,
       we use information to carry out your request to transmit that
       message to its intended recipient; and when you initiate a Kin
       transaction, we use information in order to make sure you are
       correctly credited or debited the Kin you’ve earned or spent.
     * Legitimate Interests. This means we have a legitimate interest that
       does not outweigh your privacy rights. When we collect and process
       information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we
       can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive
       on your privacy. For example, it is in our interest to protect your
       safety and security in the app, so we collect and use information
       that has been flagged by users or requested by law enforcement; to
       make sure you are satisfied with how the Services work,
       troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we collect
       and use information about how you and others use the Services; and
       to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use
       information in that request and, if relevant to the inquiry,
       information about how you access and use the Services.
     * Legal Obligations. We may need to use your personal information to
       comply with a law enforcement preservation request, subpoena, or
       other legal process or to protect the rights of other users.
     * Consent. If we have no other legal basis for collecting or using
       your information, we will ask you for consent for a specific
       purpose.  If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent at any
       time. Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing
       conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than
       consent.

   EU Users' Rights

   In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting
   deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU
   citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information,
   including:
     * Right to Object and Restrict Processing. You have the right to
       object to or restrict our use of your personal information for
       direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the
       legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate
       interest.  If you wish to object to our use of your information,
       you can send us a request to delete your account by clicking here.
     * Right to Erasure. You have the right to have your personal data
       erased and no longer processed.  You can send us a request to
       delete your account by clicking here.  Upon receiving the request,
       we will make a reasonable effort to delete your personal
       information from the app and from our internal network within a
       reasonable period of time as long as we are not obligated to
       preserve your information due to things like law enforcement
       preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations, litigation, or
       otherwise meet any of our other legal obligations.  We may also
       retain depersonalized information after deletion.
     * Data Portability. You can exercise your right to export your
       personal data by clicking here.
     * File a complaint. You have the right to complain to the data
       protection authority located in your Member State. To find contact
       details, click here.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE

   We do not respond to Do Not Track signals. More information on
   California Privacy Rights is here.

CHILDREN

   Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to create a Kik account
   or use our Services. We understand the importance of taking extra
   precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children, so we don’t
   knowingly collect, use, store, or disclose personal information from
   children under 13 (16 for users in the European Union).  If we learn
   that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a
   child under 13 (16 in the EU), we will take steps to delete the
   information as soon as possible.

DATA TRANSFERS

   We store information on servers located in the United States, Canada,
   and Israel, and may also store information on servers and equipment in
   other countries. Accordingly, when you use our Services, your personal
   information may be sent to the United States, Canada, Israel, and
   possibly other countries.  Because of this, your personal information
   may be available to legal authorities under a lawful order made in that
   country; and the laws of those countries may be less strict regarding
   your personal information than the laws where you live.

   Personal information collected in the EU may be transferred to, and
   stored at, a destination outside of the EU and processed by employees
   operating outside of the EU who work for us, one of our business
   partners, or service providers.  When we transfer personal information
   across country borders, we will make sure there is a transfer mechanism
   in place to transfer the data in a manner consistent with that
   described this Privacy Policy.

WHEN THIS POLICY APPLIES

   Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the Services offered by Kik
   Interactive Inc. and its affiliates. It does not apply to services
   offered by other companies or individuals, including products or
   services that may be displayed to you in search results, through bots
   you find in the Bot Shop, Kik optimized web pages or the Kin
   Marketplace.  Our Privacy Policy does not apply to the Kin Ecosystem
   Foundation.
