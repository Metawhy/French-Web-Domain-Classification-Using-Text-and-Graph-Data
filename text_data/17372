What people are saying

   Slouchy no more! It really works! A little buzz on my back every time I
   get out of alignment is the perfect reminder to sit up straighter :) I
   notice myself being cognizant of my posture even when I'm not wearing
   it. Definitely recommend it!
   Jane S.
   Fantastic structure. It always helps to keep my back correctly and
   warns me. I can see how my development develops every day. I love it!
   Thank you Upright!
   Alíz S.
   The Go 2 has been an interesting experience in realizing how often I
   slip into a slumped posture. It seems to happen when I am focused on a
   task. It is making me think about my stance and I hope soon to settle
   into good positions naturally. Highly recommended!
   Thomas C.
   I’m very pleased with the new Upright Go 2. I’d used the original
   model, but I was happy to pass it on to my husband and take the new
   sleek model for myself. I like the smaller size and the fact that the
   Go 2 holds a charge longer.
   Keli G.
   Boy do I need this! I'm sitting at a desk most of the day and I've been
   watching myself get more and more slumpy (not sure if that is a word).
   So far, Upright Go has been a great trainer. I'm much more aware of my
   posture even when it's not active.
   Sheri B.
   It saved me from spending a lot of time in the ER
   Elizabeth M.
   No more pain in the back and better posture.
   Mykaël B.
   My posture has improved, thanks to this tiny device ?
   Candace D.
   Standing tall brings confidence that allows me to be seen in an
   efficient presence. Using Upright go 2 has helped me with all my goals
   and needs to take care of my body and inner wellness. Thank you, Maggie
   Margaret C.
   Works well, already seeing results after only a couple of days.
