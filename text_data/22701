Compatible and extendable

   Out of the box OctoPrint is compatible with most of the available
   consumer 3D printers. And its powerful plugin system allows extending
   its functionality in various ways. To name a few:
     * Have OctoPrint send you push notifications on job progress via
       Pushbullet or Pushover.
     * Completely replace OctoPrint’s UI on mobile devices via TouchUI.
     * Integrate OctoPrint into your messaging tool of choice, like
       Telegram or Slack.
     * Collect statistics of your printer and print jobs via the Print
       History or the Printer Statistics plugin.
     * Add support for specific printers like Flashforge printers or older
       Makerbots or the Micro 3D printer.

   OctoPrint’s official plugin repository is integrated right within
   OctoPrint and installing a plugin is only a click away. And getting
   started on plugin development is easy!

Support OctoPrint

Hi! I'm Gina Häußge, the creator and main developer of OctoPrint. Thank you
for following this link!

   As you might imagine, working on OctoPrint takes a lot of time and
   effort. The development of new functionality itself plus maintenance,
   bug fixing, testing, release preparations, reviews of contributed code
   and such alone is already a huge undertaking, and that even leaves out
   other coding unrelated tasks like writing documentation, community
   management, server administration etc.

   If this sounds like a full time job, that's because it is. My full time
   work on OctoPrint is 100% crowd funded by people just like you!

   You can support OctoPrint's development directly either regularly or
   through one time contributions. You can also support my work by buying
   one of the All-in-one Kits or the Merchandise articles listed below
