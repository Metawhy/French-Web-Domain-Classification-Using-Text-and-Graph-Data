   Performance - KPIs to Validate

   VoerEir focus on helping operators be successful with their NFV
   transformation. A cornerstone in our strategy is our list of NFVI

F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager on HPE ProLiant Servers Performance
Benchmarking

   EANTC was commissioned by Intel to verify the performance gain of
   Intel® Xeon® Gold 6252N processors compared to Intel Xeon Gold 6152 for
   a reference VNF, which is F5 Networks BIG-IP LTM virtual edition. The
   BIG-IP LTM was configured as a reverse proxy virtual Application
   Delivery Controller (vADC) to handle all the HTTPS requests from the
   clients, then decrypt and load balance the traffic to the pool of back
   end servers.
