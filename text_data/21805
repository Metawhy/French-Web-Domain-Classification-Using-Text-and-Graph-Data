Perler Bead Mania

   The newest craze in our house is the perler bead magnet. Of course, my
   boys couldn't make this project easy and use the included instruction
   books. They want to make Mario Brothers, Pokemon, and other video game
   characters (which I easily found patterns for on google). These have
   made much cooler magnets than my lame "I love South Carolina" turtles.

   The best thing about this project is they have to count repeatedly.

   These beads came in two sizes so I bought the larger ones for C and D.
   I actually think I prefer the large ones. I just used jewelry cement to
   glue the magnet on the back after I molded the beads together as the
   instructions on the bead package stated.

New Job

   This year I will be a stay at home mommy to A, B, C, and D! I am so
   excited and proud of James for getting a promotion that allows me this
   opportunity. I am looking forward to blogging again and sharing my
   insanity!

What was I thinking?

   With my older boys still at Grandma's house and only 1 week until
   school starts, I decided to take our 2 and 4 year old with me to
   preschool. I thought they could play with the few toys in my classroom
   while I hung posters, and started tidying up. Yeah Right! They tore
   through that room like little tornadoes, pulling things out of shelves
   and putting them in the floor. Needless to say, I did not get much
   done! However I did learn something about my room set up and I plan on
   adjusting accordingly. If only 2 little ones can run amok in that room,
   I cannot imagine 13 little ones doing the same thing. Tonight I will be
   making a new floor plan (after PiYo class of course)!

All About Me!

   The teacher whose spot I am moving into made all about me books for
   herself and her aide. I decided to make a small one. I still would like
   to add a few pics from my childhood, but I haven't made it to my mom's
   house to rummage through family pictures. I also am going to add
   captions, but I want my colored pens that are in a cabinet at school. I
   am just going to attach with 3 rings after I add a few more pages.
   Anything else I should add? Sorry I took Iphone pics as I worked. Note
   to self: get a good digital camera to leave at my house!

Last Day

   Tomorrow is my last day before I start back to work. The last two days
   I have spent savoring my time with C and D. We have went to the splash
   park, McDonald's, Dollar Tree, Grammy's, and watched a few baseball
   games on TV.
   I did not realize how much easier having just 2 children would be.
   While it is easier my heart aches for my other boys. I know they are
   having a blast, but I still worry nonstop. Did she put sunscreen on
   them? What if they don't like what she cooked for supper? Is she
   letting them stay up late? Did they wear their seat belts? I could go
   on and on.
   Tonight I will spend making a autobiography to ready to my new class.
   Most of them had me last year, but I figure they will like looking at
   the pictures. I also have to spend time going through my curriculum
   book and starting on making plans for centers.

Chest Hair and Maxi Pads

   Today has been a blur. We have been moving nonstop since we woke up to
   get the older boys packed and ready for their week at Grandma's. Of
   course, I am completely sick to my stomach so have to occupy my time by
   randomly cleaning and organizing as we pack. In between the busy
   tidbits of our day, I have had the opportunity to listen to my 2 little
   ones share some of their latest quirks.
   C has spent the day trying to convince me that he is developing chest
   hair. He has been watching himself in the mirror and rubbing her chest
   while telling me to rub his chest, in hopes that I would see it too. It
   is so hard to keep a straight face, but he is so serious that I know he
   would be completely devastated if I so much as cracked a grin.
   This brings me to my wild maniac D who has spent the past 3 days
   carrying a maxi pad purse that I received as a freebie in the mail. He
   told me that it is his "wallet" and is not keen on replacing it anytime
   soon. It goes well with the naked baby doll he carries on his hip.
   While it drives his Dad a little nuts, I feel like he will probably be
   a really good father in tune with his wife's cycle.
   With A and B away at Grandma's this week, I am sure I will spend the
   better part of my days entertaining the 2 little ones. They will for
   sure be lost without the big boys to follow around. Hopefully this stay
   goes well and I don't lose my mind and end up driving 8 hours to get
   them back!

Lego Duplo Read and Build Party

   If you are not signed up for House Party yet, then you should be. It
   gives you an opportunity to try new products for free with your
   friends. This week we were chosen for a Lego Duplo Read and Build
   Party. We received 4 Lego Duplo Read and Build sets, a poster, 13
   magnet frames, plates, napkins, and 13 sticker sheets. The boys loved
   the sets! We were sent the farm sets, but I cannot wait to try out the
   other ones. Here is Decker checking out the animals:
   [photo+%25289%2529.JPG]
   I am definitely going to add a few of these to my block center and
   reading area. My preschoolers love Duplo anyway, but I love that there
   are stories and pictures to encourage dialog.﻿

          teaching 2 preschool classes, PTA, room-mothering, with a little
          side of OCD cleaning and cooking. I run 90 MPH all the time and
