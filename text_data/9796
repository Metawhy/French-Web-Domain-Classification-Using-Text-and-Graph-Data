     We’ve always appreciated the fact that Skyscanner shows all the
     available flights, including the low-cost carriers. The Skyscanner
     API allows us to differentiate from other inspirational/planning
     apps by offering real time pricing. The Travel APIs are lightweight
     and easy to integrate with, and it’s our primary monetization model
     right now.

   image-asset-2.png image-asset-2.png

     Skyscanner has been changing the way people travel. As a travel
     start-up, our partnership is very important, not just because of
     Skyscanner’s powerful Travel APIs, which allows for a fully
     customisable experience, but because of the power of their brand,
     that is certain to give our clients comfort and security when
     booking.

   image-asset-3.png image-asset-3.png

Browse Cache or Live Pricing?

Live Pricing API

     * Retrieve up-to-date pricing information for a specific route on a
       specific departure and arrival date.
     * The API returns all relevant pricing information for the specific
       search, allowing for price comparison and selection.
     * The data returned from the Live Pricing API is the most accurate
       pricing information for this route and travel dates that Skyscanner
       can provide.
     * To ensure a fair and honest comparison we query our partners on
       demand when you call our API.
     * You should use the Live Pricing API if you want to provide a price
       comparison for a given route on specific dates.

Browse Cache API

     * Provides an aggregated view of flights and price data for many
       origins or many destinations over many time frames, returning the
       cheapest quotes where available.
     * The prices returned are the cheapest price per day from our cache
       date.
     * Browse cache prices are stored and updated every time a user does a
       search. For each route and date combination we save the cheapest
       one-way and the cheapest stop-over prices.
     * Popular route and date combinations will be updated frequently,
       however, less popular route and date combinations will not.
     * You should choose the Browse Cache API if you want to provide a
       wide range of search with flexible dates or destinations in a more
       efficient way.
     __________________________________________________________________

     The Skyscanner Travel API was also reviewed positively by so many
     start-ups across the travel industry that we decided to approach you
     about gaining access to it. The browse cache allows us to make an
     initial scan for prices based on a certain budget before serving
     live prices. This really linked up with what we were trying to
     accomplish with the application; simplicity of booking travel
     through one budget.

   image-asset-4.png image-asset-4.png

     We use the live pricing API on our regular flight search which has
     our price prediction technology integrated on routes that are
     supported and we get all the power of Skyscanner API for our
     inspiration tool. We wanted a platform where users could search and
     compare the best flight deals available online, so we needed the
     best data on the market in one API, which turned out to be
     Skyscanner.

What it means to advertise with Skyscanner

   Skyscanner is the world's travel search engine of choice. As a
   metasearch, we offer a transparent and simple solution for dreaming,
   researching, planning, and booking travel options. We have built our
   business on our obsession for quality products, an exceptional user
   experience, and a passion for customer retention. And this translates
   into how we operate our advertising.

   We understand the need to control every component of advertising; from
   design, to messaging, to placement and targeting. This is why we
   promise our partners brand safety. We also ensure our users receive
   relevant advertising by working directly with all Skyscanner
   advertisers. Our brand, our placements, and our audience are exclusive
   to our partners and cannot be accessed through any third party.
   Finally, to ensure you get the most from advertising with Skyscanner,
   we will work closely with you to identify brand-appropriate solutions
   that will help you to meet your business objectives, and capitalise on
   our in-house expertise.

   As a technology company, we also continually deliver pioneering,
   industry-leading solutions for our users and partners. That’s why we
   were the first travel metasearch to build bots into both Facebook and
   Skype, while we also launched the first flight comparison skill for
   Amazon’s Alexa voice service. It’s also why we have become the first
   metasearch to implement direct connections, instant booking, and new
   distribution capabilities (NDC) for an even more direct and seamless
   process. Advertising with Skyscanner means being part of these
   industry-firsts and having the opportunity to leverage them.

   numerous touch-points throughout the user journey. And our intimate
   knowledge of Skyscanner users, and their behaviour, means that we can
   guide you to leverage the best solutions for your brand, and your
   objectives. This enables us to deliver solutions for any brand; whether
   you’re a premier travel brand looking to fill seats on a newly launched
   route, or a multinational communications provider looking to help our
   customers connect both home and abroad, then we have simple and
   effective solutions for you.

How we work with advertisers

   No two brands are the same, so clearly, no two advertising solutions
   should be either. That’s why we seek to offer each and every partner
   a bespoke service, tailored directly to their needs, with a named
   client manager to assist and advise across everything from design to
   technology.

   So, as well as offering standard iAB and native units on-site with a
   wide range of targeting options, and delivering audience extension
   based on our third party data management platform, we aim to work with
   our partners to provide options which reflect both your brand and
   business objectives. Whether you are an airline looking to showcase
   your latest offerings and innovations, or a non-travel brand looking to
   tap into our unique audience, we can create the perfect package for
   you.

   Our industry-leading data and analytics also enable us to optimise and
   report regularly on your objectives and how they are being met. Helping
   you direct every penny of your budget towards the most rewarding and
   effective customers. Using our in-house experimentation toolkit and
   expertise, we can test creatives and messaging to determine the best
   combination for your campaign; through our API and reporting tools we
   build and share custom and sales reports with you on a regular basis;
   and through connectivity with 3rd party ad servers we can run campaigns
   optimised for custom metrics, whilst also delivering seamless billing
   and invoicing options.

Market insights. Global competitive advantage.

   Travel Insight is a powerful business planning and analytics data
   source that is particularly beneficial for airline network planning and
   revenue management, airport route development and travel-related
   marketing. Travel Insight is based on a unique big data set that draws
   data from over 200m global searches every month and is updated daily to
   give you a unique insight into what travellers want, and provide you
   with information from the day before and as far ahead as a year into
   the future. Finally, the Travel Insight dashboards are tailored for the
   needs of industry stakeholders and our data is also available as raw
   files to complement your internal reporting, or enhance your current
   marketing intelligence and travel analytics.
     __________________________________________________________________


Key benefits of Travel Insight

     * Our redirect or click-through data gives you up to date insights
       into customer purchasing preferences. For example, which prices and
       itineraries are driving sales and receiving the most interest,
       which can help you further optimise your route schedules.
     * Our travel search data gives you an invaluable overview of what
       your customers are looking for, including insights into the most
       popular destinations. This can help you price your routes
       competitively and identify new opportunities.
     * Our data is geo-tagged, so we know on aggregate where your
       customers are when they’re searching and when you are losing
       passengers to a competitor airport or airline. This can help you to
       understand the catchment areas and plan your marketing campaigns
       more efficiently.

     information, in an easily consumable format. The team have been
     helpful and accommodating to work alongside – dealing with any
     questions we had quickly and efficiently. During certain occasions,
     the availability of the data really comes into its own; for example
     during peak periods of the year, the information helps us better
     understand the seasonality of our digital channels.
