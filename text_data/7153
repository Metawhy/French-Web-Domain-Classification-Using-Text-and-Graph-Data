How will voice assistants affect children's behaviour? Here's what we still
don't know

Won't somebody think of the children?

   Will voice assistants affect children?

   Earlier this year, a group of child development and privacy advocates
   released a statement urging parents not to purchase the new Amazon Echo
   Dot Kids Edition, as it poses “significant threats to children’s
   well-being and privacy.” The same day, two lawmakers sent a letter to
   Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asking what steps the company was taking to
   ensure the product would not negatively affect children's development.

   The same group – Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC), a US
   coalition of healthcare professionals, educators, advocacy groups, and
   concerned parents – previously called on Mattel to stop production of
   Aristotle, an Amazon Echo-type listening and talking device for babies
   and young children. In October 2017, Mattel announced it had cancelled
   plans to sell the product as a result of the backlash.

   Despite the outcry from groups like the CCFC, few research studies have
   focused on the relationship between kids and home-based voice
   assistants. Are Amazon Echo and Google Home high-tech educational tools
   or marketing devices designed to spy on families? Do they truly pose a
   threat to our children? Many questions like these still remain
   unanswered, about the impact of such technology on early learning,
   development and wellbeing.

   “Technology can be very powerful and also a useful tool for children,
   but there are certain concerns to be mindful of,” said Kaveri
   Subrahmanyam, a developmental psychologist at California State
   University, Los Angeles. “I don't think technology is the Big Bad Wolf,
   but limits are good to set, and parents have to be mindful of both
   their children’s media use and their own media use.”

     If you are rude to somebody, there is generally retribution

   Subrahmanyam studies young people's use of digital media and its
   effects on learning and development. While she hasn't looked at voice
   assistants specifically, her research has explored the risks and
   opportunities afforded by the internet, social media, and digital
   screen devices. For instance, the cognitive impact of digital screen
   media depends on the age of the child, the kind of programming, the
   social context of viewing, and the particular kind of interactive media
   (eg computer games versus television).

   For children younger than two years old, television viewing has mostly
   negative associations for language and executive functioning skills,
   which includes attentional control, cognitive inhibition, and working
   memory. For preschool-aged children, television viewing can have
   positive outcomes on cognitive development, especially with educational
   programming.

   “As with the internet and other media, there are advantages and
   benefits for children when it comes to virtual assistants, such as
   information, learning, communication and social skill development,”
   said Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, the founder and president of Children
   and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development. “But one
   question is whether they can promote good behaviour or bad behaviour in
   children.”

   No kidding: The impact

Pretty please?

   Some parents have expressed worries that Alexa and other virtual
   assistants are conditioning their children to be rude. Because the
   devices don't require social niceties like “please” and “thank you” to
   function, parent Hunter Walk fears that his Echo is “turning his
   daughter into a raging asshole.” In a 2016 blog post, the San
   Francisco-based tech investor requested a kid-mode where the Echo only
   responded to “Alexa, please…”

   His prayers were answered when Amazon rolled out a new “magic word”
   feature that rewarded kids with positive reinforcement when saying
   “please.” Similarly, Google unveiled a Pretty Please feature for the
   Home smart speaker that will respond positively to polite phrasing.

   “I don’t honestly think that children think these devices are life-like
   objects, but they are still life-like in their interactions. If you are
   rude to Alexa, can you hurt her feelings?” said Subrahmanyam. “If you
   are rude to somebody, there is generally retribution. Are kids likely
   to transfer the learning from these interactions to face-to-face
   settings?”

     There's a tendency to anthropomorphise these virtual assistants

   She notes that sometimes children who grow up in cultures with a wide
   social status differential can be seen acting disrespectful to “the
   help.” Because their parents' maids and gardeners have a lower social
   status and cannot retaliate without losing their job, such privileged
   children may exhibit little regard for politeness and respect.

   A major difference between a child watching television versus
   interacting with a voice assistant is the personification of the
   device. Some experts warn that encouraging children to form
   pseudo-bonds with devices undermines their ability to form healthy
   relationships with people.

   “Children heretofore were looking to their parents and grandparents for
   answers to various questions, and there’s a bond that develops as a
   result,” said Hurst-Della Pietra. “Because there's a tendency to
   anthropomorphise these virtual assistants, families need to be very
   thoughtful about how they are using them if they decide to bring them
   into their homes.”

   Overall, Subrahmanyam believes that some concerns about home-based
   voice assistants from parents and child development experts are
   legitimate. For instance, a feature that entertains children when they
   say the phrase, “Alexa, I'm bored” makes her cringe. She reminisces
   about the days that kids occupied themselves with their own imagination
   and creativity.

   “When I see students today, there's never a time when you see kids
   without their eyes on a screen. When I was young, you looked out the
   window. You struck up random conversations with people. You had
   interesting interactions with strangers,” she said. “I just wonder how
   much of that is lost when you have technology always ready to entertain
   you.”
