Every Kid Wants to Buy Their Father a House

   July 13, 2015 / Matthew / Comments Off on Every Kid Wants to Buy Their
   Father a House

   Ask people if they know who Charles Green is, and most people will tell
   you that they don’t know.

   Ask people about the tantrum-throwing, PS4-breaking, YouTube star
   called Angry Grandpa and you might just see a smile on those same
   people’s faces. Angry Grandpa’s wild reactions to the pranks pulled by
   his son, Michael, have gained him worldwide notoriety.

   “For the past few months, Bridgette and I have been planning a huge
   prank on Angry Grandpa and today’s the day we’re going to pull it off,”
   Michael says at the beginning of this video.

   The prank in question is that they’ve been dragging Charles from house
   to house, looking for what he believes to be a new home for Michael –
   when he is in, fact helping to pick out the home that Michael plans to
   buy for him.

   Grandpa’s reaction is far from angry this time.

   “Every kid wants to buy their father a house,” says Michael.

   Well played, sir. Well played.

   July 11, 2015 / Matthew / Comments Off on The new Star Wars: The Force
   Awakens BTS video is absolutely amazing!

   There’s “nostalgia,” and then there are the things that make you feel
   like a little kid again. The official Star Wars Twitter account just
   dropped an incredible BTS video that was screened at the panel
   yesterday at Comic-Con.

   Star Wars fans, movie fans, or anyone wanting to see an incredibly
   charming look at how epic movies are made – this is definitely worth
   three minutes of your time.

   YouTube user Justin Hall hid a camera to catch his in-laws reaction to
   the news that he and his wife were pregnant.

   What was captured on the video was nothing short of brilliant.
