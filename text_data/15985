   Graduate Employability Rankings 2020

   While many of the world’s top universities produce high-achieving
   graduates every year, employers frequently express concerns that
   academic institutions aren’t doing enough to prepare their students for
   the world of work.

   Soft skills in particular are mentioned repeatedly, while there is a
   notable ‘skills gap’ in some industries, notably engineering and
   technology.

   Given the fierce competition for graduate roles around the world,
   students should be seriously considering how their university can
   prepare them adequately for full-time employment, by connecting them
   with global employers and ensuring they develop the necessary skills
   and knowledge.

   For example, one in two recent British graduates is not in graduate
   work - suggesting a university degree from one of the world’s most
   reputable universities is no longer enough by itself to guarantee
   career success.

   If you’re concerned about your future career prospects and wondering
   which universities are best-placed to help you succeed, our ranking
   below is a great place to start.

   employability, click here or join in the conversation online by

   Graduate Employability Rankings 2020

   While many of the world’s top universities produce high-achieving
   graduates every year, employers frequently express concerns that
   academic institutions aren’t doing enough to prepare their students for
   the world of work.

   Soft skills in particular are mentioned repeatedly, while there is a
   notable ‘skills gap’ in some industries, notably engineering and
   technology.

   Given the fierce competition for graduate roles around the world,
   students should be seriously considering how their university can
   prepare them adequately for full-time employment, by connecting them
   with global employers and ensuring they develop the necessary skills
   and knowledge.

   For example, one in two recent British graduates is not in graduate
   work - suggesting a university degree from one of the world’s most
   reputable universities is no longer enough by itself to guarantee
   career success.

   If you’re concerned about your future career prospects and wondering
   which universities are best-placed to help you succeed, our ranking
   below is a great place to start.

   To read more about the best-performing universities for graduate
   employability, click here or join in the conversation online by

   Graduate Employability Rankings 2020

   While many of the world’s top universities produce high-achieving
   graduates every year, employers frequently express concerns that
   academic institutions aren’t doing enough to prepare their students for
   the world of work.

   Soft skills in particular are mentioned repeatedly, while there is a
   notable ‘skills gap’ in some industries, notably engineering and
   technology.

   Given the fierce competition for graduate roles around the world,
   students should be seriously considering how their university can
   prepare them adequately for full-time employment, by connecting them
   with global employers and ensuring they develop the necessary skills
   and knowledge.

   For example, one in two recent British graduates is not in graduate
   work - suggesting a university degree from one of the world’s most
   reputable universities is no longer enough by itself to guarantee
   career success.

   If you’re concerned about your future career prospects and wondering
   which universities are best-placed to help you succeed, our ranking
   below is a great place to start.

   employability, click here or join in the conversation online by
