   2019-08-02: An update for SmartCo 3.0.0


   2017/08/25

   A little update for BetterPushback 0.44 and above

   2017/07/22

   skiselkov did a hard work to give us his BetterPushback smartcopilot
   compatible.

   Please, read the readme.

   Tested with X Plane 11 and the 1.2 release.

   It's here as usual: https://sky4crew.com/download/

   2017/07/01

   Only tested with X Plane 10, and the new plugin (2.07)

   https://sky4crew.com/download/

   Fixed a bug with throttle.

   Tfc buttons synchronized.

   seats are synch. We can go to the toilets.

   A new one, cabin door, (but no joy with cargo),

   Winglets, gauges, eyebrow

   Master only: Ground Services tab, can (and must) set fuel, payload and
   CG.

   No more flicker with buttons and knobs spring loaded (APU switch,
   rudder trim knob, fire test ...........)

   standby altimeter

   As before, nothing to do with the guards, Init Pos by captain only).

   Waiting for a fix, you can use EZ Pushback (By master)


   If you are newbie with smartco, read the readme.

   Hi,


   I have done a first small complete flight (1 hour about) with a
   copilot, from cold and dark.


   Nils, you can eat your shoes.


   Cristiano, you can kiss me.


   One problem though, at some point the left CDU was unable to display
   the leg page. Probably a bug of the plane, not of smartco.


   I have done improvements of the configuration file :


   Don't use any axis for speed brakes. Only use mouse or buttons.


   If the master have an axis for the tiller, it can be used during the
   push back.


   From master to slave, fuel and payload are synchronized (at least
   starting cold and dark). Now doable after the connection.


   Also, always by master only, wiglets and gauges (in Preferences) are
   synchronized.


   The access door of manual extension gear does not work. (as guards).
   Each pilot have to open it.


   Remaining problems :


   Guards and gear door, i suspect a sound problem. Only devs can do
   something (smartco is on their to-do list)


   Spring loaded switches and knobs (APU, trims, clock), something is
   doable by the devs, as such switches and knobs works properly with the
   Saab. They are driven by 2 datarefs, one for the state of the
   button/switch, one for their movement.



   Some non implemented features we found during the flight :


   In plan mode, step on the right Leg page does not work.


   The Clock buttons (non animated) of the MCP are tied with the CHR
   button of the clock. Not sure, but buttons of the MCP launch the timer
   for block to block and in flight time, the CHR launch a separate timer.


   The month/year display 87.


   The hold/run/reset switch of the clock does nothing.


   A second transponder code is not stored. The switch ½ on the
   transponder panel only change the display ATC 1 to ATC 2.


   PS: what is the use of: ixeg/733/misc/my_weapon1_x, 1_y etc? Nils,
   please, go and test/improve it, easy if you have a lan with 2
   computers.


   Claude.

   Claude you're a genius! Those bugs are nuances we can live with as for
   now and that will be surely sorted out. Thanks man.

   I also applaud the work done here! I will certainly try myself, and by
   the time we have killed the most bugs, your SmartCopilot will be
   working perfectly, I am sure! :)

   Really nice! I did not believe it would work this fast after release.
   Though I've not tested it, but hopefully later on there will a flight
   with a copilot. :) It would be a blast!

   Flicker on the slave's throttle is fixed.

   If you start cold and dark, don't use the GPU (APU is ok). I miss a
   couple of datarefs..For the slave, the GPU appear, but, the avallable
   annunciator stay dark.

   Nothing i can do without a help of the devs.

   I don't know why. Probably a conflict plugin. You should have a look in
   your log.txt, and have a try removing not necessaries plugins.

   Deleting the preferences folder and plugins should be enough.

   My advice is a little too late. Anyway, it's a happy end.

   Wonderful work. I tried it tonight - works, but I'm getting an awful
   lot of stutter (every 15s, stutters for 1-2s) and the trim going
   apeshit every 5s (non-stop adjustments by a few degrees of the trim
   wheel). Any ideas? I'm gonna retest with weather sync turned off.

   Hi skiselkov,


   I join here a file without weather (for a first test, set your weather
   on CAVOK before launching the connection, then with the same weather
   injector on both side), and without most of stock engines datarefs.
   They are overriden  by custom dararefs.

   Values of engines are computed by each plugin and does not match (as
   simratio are not the same on each side).

   What will happen after a long fly about predictions and gross weight
   (FF and fuel used are not the same)?

   Look at your ping and frame rate when freeze occurs. Ping over 100ms
   and framerate below 25 fps could be the problem. The P key is
   synchronized. So you can pause both sims, modify your settings if
   necessary and leave the pause.

   Also, if you have the Sundog plugins, try without them.


   Claude.

   I will be in front of my main computer next tuesday only.

   New datarefs are probably strings, and should not affect smartcopilot.

   This one is interesting: "Various fixes to sound engine.  Some sounds
   being heard when they should not and vice versa", because it could
   solve the guard caps problem.

   After testing with @dr_nerdrage we made some changes to:
    1. Sync weather properly
    2. Solve an issue we were having with the Nav 2 radio not being synced
       and glitching in the cockpit.
    3. Added sim/engines/TOGA_power to [COMMANDS] section so N1 would work
       at takeoff
    4. Remove glare-shield checklist sync so they can be looked at
       independently.

   Cheers,

   Justin

   Hi jsnapp and dr_nerdrage. I am happy: no more alone with this file!


   1 Weather:

   Seems to me that during final, hand flying by the slave, it is better
   to have winds, shear and turbulence continuously synchronized (not each
   5 seconds). This is the settings I use since one year or more. Is it
   better ? Debate is opened, but I think yes.

    About bandwidth, datas are transmitted only if values are renewed. So,
   no problem here.

   In fact, the best and luxurious way (more expensive), is to delete
   everything about weather, and use on both side FSRGW + Sundog plugins.
   So, each pilots have the same visual and visibility, same spots on the
   weather radar ( which is a wonderful part  of the simulation).


   2. NAV2. Good new, I had hard time with radios.

   There is a mystery with some knobs. If we sync the knobs theme self,
   (ixeg/733/radios/radios_nav1_mhz , ixeg/733/radios/radios_nav1_khz ),
   we can’t set some values  For example, 114.xx is not doable, only
   113.xx or 115.xx.

   Same with the speed knob (ixeg/733/MCP/mcp_ias_mach_act ). Here
   250knpts is not possible, only 249 or 251.

   But ADFs, altitude… are right.

   3 TOGA: good catch.

   4: Check list: better. It was already on my to-do list.

   Tried this tonight, it was the most fun I have had in years....i am
   used to flying the Leonardo Maddog in shared cockpit in FSX but this
   was a million times better. We had a few moments of lag as the weather
   updated at high level but all in all it was terrific. Did not seem to
   synchronise the time with the Master which gave a few wrong times in
   the FMC but I can live with that. If you haven't tried shared cockpit,
   don't delay, you will love it.

   Claude.


   1)  My understanding of the way you had the file (and how we tried to
   leave it) is that those important aspects of wind altitude, speed,
   direction, and sheer are indeed synced well using the [CONTINUED]
   section, so that the pilot flying is the one sending that data to the
   other about winds.   Looking at the file again though I see I
   accidentally also included those lines in [SLOW] as well.   (Not sure
   how smartcopilot handles the double inclusion of a dataref in multiple
   places.  oops.)   I have commented them out now in the attached .cfg
   file that I am calling version 1.2.1 (hope you don't mind).   The
   remaining weather items though I do think should be in slow, like
   setting the cloud types and height and barometric pressure.  Those
   don't change very often and if they do they cause redrawing in the sim,
   correct?


   2) The issue with nav2 is that doesn't seem to be a way to have both
   the dataref for the clickspot/knob actions (sorry I am blanking on the
   correct 3d cockpit terminology lingo) synced and having the tuned radio
   frequency stay synced.   If you try and sync the user interface actions
   to get sound, if the over eager first officer drags the knob to fast
   you might lose a click and then the frequency will be mismatched.
   Currently we have it as you left nav1 where you just sync the frequency
   using the X-plane built in nav1/2 dataref and that means the frequency
   is well synced, but the two pilots don't hear the sound or see the
   animation of the other pilot tuning the radio.  This along with the
   ability to sync the guards for example on the battery, emergency
   lights, and manual gear extension (to name 3 examples) are places where
   the developers will probably need to help out the effort by providing
   the appropriate underlying datarefs.  Once @tkyler and @Morten get a
   breather perhaps they can help us out. :-)


   The biggest remaining issues I see are as follows:

   A/ Especially in cruise, we still see (and hear) the elevator trim
   seeming to fight and conflict, which leads to a sort of continuous
   stuttering trimming occurring.   Does not impact in flight experience
   though.  (Perhaps my latest edits to fix my goofs, see item 1 above,
   and attach config file will help, I don't know, haven't had a chance
   yet to fly it again with @dr_nerdrage.)


   B/ The FMC presents a huge challenge to sync between the two planes
   because it is a system with memory.   On at least one occasion we have
   for example it will declare something like "Drag Required" on one
   system but not on the other.  90+% of the time though it seems to be in
   sync.   Mostly it seems by making sure we communicate and ensure the
   scratch pad stays clean and in sync we have no problems though in
   actual flying.  Yay.   Again @tkyler will be needed to help with making
   sure the FMC and autopilot modes always stay well synced.  (Btw,
   hilarity will and did ensue on one flight where we accidentally tried
   to fly with one pilot using navigraph data and the other using aerosoft
   data.  The two FMCs happily programmed totally different routes from
   start to finish.  ha.)


   ***** For those not interested in these nitty gritty development
   details, the smartcopilot file here is in immensely great shape and
   this plane is an absolute joy to fly together with another person, so
   go out there and fly!   I am really hoping we can create a "virtual
   airline" of sorts with a fleet of 733's (and dare we include a few
   732's and 722's) for us collectively to smartcopilot around the world
   together! ****

   Cheers,

   Justin

   Indeed...this is a very rough week schedule wise.  "Graduation time!"
   Family, events, etc.   I am about to begin some serious FMS calibration
   work though, beginning next week....looking to squash bugs and work on
   missing features and improved LNAV and VNAV.  After that, I'll
   definitely be interested in evaluating the shared copoilot situations.

   -tkyler

   Totally understand, and absolutely agree that those development efforts
   should take priority!


   @birdy.dma perhaps it is worth revisiting the "nav2 situation" as I
   read in this thread:

   IFRAME:
   http://forums.x-pilot.com/forums/topic/9560-saitek-radio-nav2-problem-d
   ifferent-logic-nav1-nav2/?do=embed

   that in 1.0.3 hotfix the differing logic between Nav1 and Nav2 got
   fixed.    I still don't fully understand the IXEG representation of
   radio frequencies with the different truncations of the frequency.
   Maybe @tkyler you can give a two sentence explanation of why it is done
   that way?  But at least now it seems better syncing of the radio and
   inclusion of the animation might be possible.   I will put it on my
   todo list for @dr_nerdrage and I to investigate.

   This week, i have no time to work properly about X Plane things.

   Some improvements to test in this file  (jsnapp fixes are included).

   Fight of wheel trim is fixed.

   The 2 spots on the roof, behind the seats are now synchronized.

   Axes settings are send from master to slave (Recommended by Morten: 3
   left cursors to 0, 3 right cursors to 25%, null zone to 10).

   @jsnapp. You are right.about weather. No joy with animation of the
   radios knobs (speed knob as well).

   Claude.

   Well, I'd be happy to teach Jan The Mighty Dash, in exchange for
   lessons in The Classic Seven, but I suspect he's been there and done
   that--and no jet pilot longs for turboprops, except the completely
   eccentric. And he's not quite that weird.


   Best,


   Marshall

   Hi all,

   Just using the latest smart-copilot file (1.0.3) and flying right now.
   Problem being that my weather is fine but, my friends (copilot) isn't
   syncing fully, only the winds..no clouds. When he goes and disconnects,
   XP allows him again to use real weather and he gets all of his clouds
   back, Then when he reconnects, it just goes back to how it was. It
   seems that the 'master' mode makes the 'slave' mode deactivate real
   weather on the person who is in slave mode as we did switch between
   them. He is also experiencing in 'slave' mode a lot of jittering, with
   a ping of 20ms, which to me that's more than fine. Never seen this
   before with other shared cockpit aircraft.

   Thanks,

   ZeeMuffenMan.

   The very apparent jittering is likely caused by the difference in
   weather. Is he using a weather plugin like NOAA that is still enabled?
   Are you using the latest version of the smartcopilot cfg?

   Like I said, version of the file is the one that says 1.0.3. And like
   me too, he doesn't have any weather plugin, only FSGRW.

   FSGRW is a weather plugin.

   To be clear.

   1- Weather is transmitted from Master to Slave. In this case, there is
   no weather at all for the Slave PC (No X Plane, no NOAA, no FSGRW, no,
   no, no.......).

   2- No weather in the config file. Each X Plane manage his own weather.
   Of course, in this case, we must have the same weather all along the
   flight. FSGRW, with same settings for Master and Slave is a
   possibility, not tested with NOAA (are both sims refreshed
   simultaneously, or quiet simultaneously as it is with FSGRW?), You can
   also have the same settings for a static weather in X Plane, etc..


   I join, for you, 2 config files, with and without weather. (you already
   have one of them, don't forget to rename the file you are using).

   I had the same experience, master and slave synchronised weather of
   FSGRW from the Master but the clouds did not synchronise. As a result
   we could not read the same winds but I was visual on final and he was
   in loud until 400ft above the ground. Can we just remove weather
   Synchronisation and each person runs their own or actually synchronise
   it fully from master to slave?

   Cheers for the fast replay. Yes, weather syncing is 100% understandable
   but when it doesn't always work, it can be annoying. Cheers for the
   files once again!

   Thanks,

   ZeeMuffenMan.

   PS: the super secret and nowhere to be found secret (did I mention
   secret?) authorisation code the be used when trying to register on the
   actual smart coplit forum, is a really good way to keep simpletons like
   me away ;)

   For the life of me, I can't find any secret auth code.

   My friend's plane keeps jittering when we fly. He also doesn't have
   clouds. Does anyone else have an issue with the slave's plane
   jittering?

   It is in the readme.

   Don't assign any axis to the speed brakes. Instead, assign joystick
   buttons.

   Have a lot of fun.

   Claude, will this file need updating for 1.4.1? It worked brilliantly
   in XP11 with version 1.3

   Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk

   This bird is brilliant, and fantastic with a crew of 2.

   This winter, there was an Ivao event at London City. Unflyable alone
   with such a plane, even hard time with 2 pilots on board. One of my
   more exiting flight. Hope the 1.4.1 is not definitively broken.

   I know, here we are a niche in the niche, but who knows?


   To be more comfortable for the smartcopiloters, few custom datarefs are
   really missing. In fact much more, but at least 4.

   Starting cold and dark, we need to have battery and emergency guards
   synchronized, also the 2 carts.

   At some point, could the devs add:

   ixeg/733/electrical/batt_pwr_status (0.1). Only this one will be
   synchronized thru smartco.

   It will activate the battery guard. So each plugin will do the job at
   his own speed with the existing and non synchronizable
   ixeg/733/electrical/batt_pwr_guard.


   Same with the emergency light guard.
   ixeg/733/electrical/emer_lights_status (0,1).


   About the carts, ixeg/733/groundobjs/air_cart_status and

   ixeg/733/groundobjs/gpu_cart_status will synchronize the tick of the 2
   D popup and execute the script.

   As it is today, ixeg/733/groundobjs/gpu_cart_kill show/hide the cart
   for both pilots, but the script is executed only for the pilot who have
   ticked the cart, the other one have not the GPU available.


   Regards

   Silly question, have registered to try this out but surprised that
   theres no base config files for the x-plane aircraft just a few files
   for what looks like payware. Does anyone have base config files for
   x-plane default aircraft?

   The Smartcopilot plugin is a payware, but you can test it for
   free: https://sky4crew.com/

   The configuration files are provided for free by a couple of pilots.If
   you are courageous, you can try to write a file for a cockpit you want
   to share with a friend.

   Thanks Birdy, sorry perhaps I didn't explain - we have the software up
   and running to test and looks good albeit we are having to use one of
   the config fiels for another Baron which seems to work in the main but
   GPS etc doesn't replicate.  I couldn't see any config files created for
   the stock baron/Cessna in x-plane but found one on the PilotEdge site
   which we will give a go!


   thanks

   There is a real interest for a shared cockpit, more than expected at
   least by me.

   Almost 1000 downloads for the last release including BP!

   You can.

   This is the last
   one! https://sky4crew.com/download/737-classic-1-2-betterpushback/

   Of course, use BP 0.46.

   Hi there, I’m using version 1.2 of my IXEG, and I was wondering if you
   could help me out. I’m using smartcopilot latest version, and when I’m
   the slave, somehow, my PFD once my IRS are alligned, just stop working.
   It looks as if it was pointing towards the sky and “bank angle” warning
   just starts to sound all over the flight, once I take off, it seems to
   fix, but then it goes wrong again.

   is there a way to have .cfg that mixes version 1.2 compatibility with
   smartco 0.3?

   thanks a lot

   2019-08-02: An update for SmartCo 3.0.0


   2017/08/25

   A little update for BetterPushback 0.44 and above

   2017/07/22

   skiselkov did a hard work to give us his BetterPushback smartcopilot
   compatible.

   Please, read the readme.

   Tested with X Plane 11 and the 1.2 release.

   It's here as usual: https://sky4crew.com/download/

   2017/07/01

   Only tested with X Plane 10, and the new plugin (2.07)

   https://sky4crew.com/download/

   Fixed a bug with throttle.

   Tfc buttons synchronized.

   seats are synch. We can go to the toilets.

   A new one, cabin door, (but no joy with cargo),

   Winglets, gauges, eyebrow

   Master only: Ground Services tab, can (and must) set fuel, payload and
   CG.

   No more flicker with buttons and knobs spring loaded (APU switch,
   rudder trim knob, fire test ...........)

   standby altimeter

   As before, nothing to do with the guards, Init Pos by captain only).

   Waiting for a fix, you can use EZ Pushback (By master)


   If you are newbie with smartco, read the readme.

   Hi,


   I have done a first small complete flight (1 hour about) with a
   copilot, from cold and dark.


   Nils, you can eat your shoes.


   Cristiano, you can kiss me.


   One problem though, at some point the left CDU was unable to display
   the leg page. Probably a bug of the plane, not of smartco.


   I have done improvements of the configuration file :


   Don't use any axis for speed brakes. Only use mouse or buttons.


   If the master have an axis for the tiller, it can be used during the
   push back.


   From master to slave, fuel and payload are synchronized (at least
   starting cold and dark). Now doable after the connection.


   Also, always by master only, wiglets and gauges (in Preferences) are
   synchronized.


   The access door of manual extension gear does not work. (as guards).
   Each pilot have to open it.


   Remaining problems :


   Guards and gear door, i suspect a sound problem. Only devs can do
   something (smartco is on their to-do list)


   Spring loaded switches and knobs (APU, trims, clock), something is
   doable by the devs, as such switches and knobs works properly with the
   Saab. They are driven by 2 datarefs, one for the state of the
   button/switch, one for their movement.



   Some non implemented features we found during the flight :


   In plan mode, step on the right Leg page does not work.


   The Clock buttons (non animated) of the MCP are tied with the CHR
   button of the clock. Not sure, but buttons of the MCP launch the timer
   for block to block and in flight time, the CHR launch a separate timer.


   The month/year display 87.


   The hold/run/reset switch of the clock does nothing.


   A second transponder code is not stored. The switch ½ on the
   transponder panel only change the display ATC 1 to ATC 2.


   PS: what is the use of: ixeg/733/misc/my_weapon1_x, 1_y etc? Nils,
   please, go and test/improve it, easy if you have a lan with 2
   computers.


   Claude.

   Claude you're a genius! Those bugs are nuances we can live with as for
   now and that will be surely sorted out. Thanks man.

   I also applaud the work done here! I will certainly try myself, and by
   the time we have killed the most bugs, your SmartCopilot will be
   working perfectly, I am sure! :)

   Really nice! I did not believe it would work this fast after release.
   Though I've not tested it, but hopefully later on there will a flight
   with a copilot. :) It would be a blast!

   Flicker on the slave's throttle is fixed.

   If you start cold and dark, don't use the GPU (APU is ok). I miss a
   couple of datarefs..For the slave, the GPU appear, but, the avallable
   annunciator stay dark.

   Nothing i can do without a help of the devs.

   I don't know why. Probably a conflict plugin. You should have a look in
   your log.txt, and have a try removing not necessaries plugins.

   Deleting the preferences folder and plugins should be enough.

   My advice is a little too late. Anyway, it's a happy end.

   Wonderful work. I tried it tonight - works, but I'm getting an awful
   lot of stutter (every 15s, stutters for 1-2s) and the trim going
   apeshit every 5s (non-stop adjustments by a few degrees of the trim
   wheel). Any ideas? I'm gonna retest with weather sync turned off.

   Hi skiselkov,


   I join here a file without weather (for a first test, set your weather
   on CAVOK before launching the connection, then with the same weather
   injector on both side), and without most of stock engines datarefs.
   They are overriden  by custom dararefs.

   Values of engines are computed by each plugin and does not match (as
   simratio are not the same on each side).

   What will happen after a long fly about predictions and gross weight
   (FF and fuel used are not the same)?

   Look at your ping and frame rate when freeze occurs. Ping over 100ms
   and framerate below 25 fps could be the problem. The P key is
   synchronized. So you can pause both sims, modify your settings if
   necessary and leave the pause.

   Also, if you have the Sundog plugins, try without them.

   I read in 1.0.3 new datarefs are added regarding CDU, does your profile
   compatible with them cause I afraid we will lose some options between
   crew members, don't we?

            By Cameron, in Aircraft, February 6, 2016
            [E175_XCrafts_1.1.thumb.jpg.dabe2b7e43f68fd5b6e1c9cd9741c742.j
            pg]
            X-Crafts has released a big update for their Embraer 175
            product. This brings the product up to version 1.1, and the
            changes in this update include:

            E175 v1.1 changelog:
            - Ground equipment and pushback options are now restored after
            landing (more details below)
            - The winglets can now be changed through a plugin menu
            - There are now 12 liveries included in the package
            and 21 additional liveries available here - total of 33
            Liveries
            - More details and dirt added to all liveries included in the
            package
            - SASL updated to version 2.4
            - Engine start sounds fixed
            - Cockpit windows are fixed (the glass of the windows wasn't
            moving)
            - New avionics sounds
            - New chrono clock
            - Reverse now works separately with hardware throttle
            - Clicking spots on the MFD are all bigger now - very easy to
            click on all the buttons
            - Vertical ILS diamonds fixed
            - CRS indicator in PFD is now working
            - GPU can now be turned on and off on the overhead panel
            - ATHR can only be engaged after takeoff
            - Cursor changed when changing the range in MAP Options menu.
            (TIP: You can also change the range directly from the range
            indicator in the map!)
            - windshield was shiny in the middle
            - VOR bearing pointer added to the NAV map
            - Alitalia livery has many added details
            - Flap sounds inside are too loud
            - Updated xfmc and xchecklist config files
            - Fans were rotating in the wrong direction
            - The lights on the new winglets also illuminate the
            surroundings now
            - Big misplaced nav lights on winglets corrected
            - Artifitial horizon was showing wrong values
            - N E S W highlighted on the FMS
            - The little black line on the EFIS horizon is gone

            FMS changes:
            1.  Corrected ability to override warning that a flight plan
            .fms file exists when selecting a filename to use when saving
            the current route.

            2.  Corrected coding that does not properly detect and reject
            waypoint misplacement if the waypoint is an NDB, and a VOR
            with the same NAVID is found before the plugin finds the
            correct NDB waypoint.

            3.  Corrected display of the FLT PLAN page when no waypoints
            have been loaded.

            4.  Added ability to read tail.txt files, placed in livery
            folders, allowing the RADIO 1 page to display the actual tail
            number for the aircraft depicted in the livery.  The maximum
            number of characters that can currently be displayed is eight
            (8).  (Default is ERJ-175).

            More info regarding the plugin changes:
            1.  Added X-Plane plugin menu item that will allow the user to
            select the type of winglets that are to be used.  This
            persists from X-Plane session to session by use of config
            file.  If the config file is not found at first, one is
            created and the default winglets are used.

            2.  Ground equipment and pushback options are now restored
            following a flight, subject to the following conditions:

                        a.  The aircraft has flown, detected by reaching
            an altitude AGL of at least 100 feet.
                        b.  Ground speed is zero.
                        c.  The parking brake has been set.

X-Plane 10.45 RC-1 Released
            By Cameron, in General Information, January 28, 2016
            [d5ee94aab0ebd205e173fb1a7c08c6c4.png.546677960e1e90b41e135d58
            3d5bbf0f.thumb.png.bc384f046e2fea5c4869cf9baa695a80.png]
            Laminar Research has released X-Plane 10.45 RC-1 to the wild.
            As per their release, "X-Plane 10.45 is a “small” patch for us
            in that it doesn’t contain major changes to the code, but it
            contains a number of features you might like."
            Changes include:
            An update to the global airports. The global airports won’t
            conflict with custom scenery – new exclusion  technology
            prevents overlapping buildings. Nav data has been
            significantly updated – lots of bug fixes are in 10.45. The
            GPS data for the G430 now contains IAFs, so you can fly GPS
            approaches with proper transitions. Proper prop torque
            for aircraft that opt in.

Real Weather Connector Announced
            By Morrigan, in Plugins, January 10, 2016
            [58e9cc19cd5cf857a7a8b01bb2ddc67d.jpg.058e971e5edcd103219d7800

            Sundog Software and X-Aviation have announced work on 'Real
            Weather Connector', a product to work with SkyMaxx Pro v3.
            Real Weather Connector will enhance and alter the way weather
            is generated for X-Plane.
            Real Weather Connector will be released as its own product,
            but it will require SkyMaxx Pro v3 to work, utilizing
            downloaded weather data and generate clouds in their actual
            locations.
            To read more about the product, and follow Sundog's
            development, visit X-Pilot's forum thread.

PMDG Announces First X-Plane Project
            By Cameron, in Aircraft, March 6, 2015
            [8194a03f039fa214d78ad7c9cf17bdfa.jpg.36b94fecd3025f46b9e8131e
            c5f00fbb.jpg]
            PMDG has officially announced the Douglas DC-6 as their entry
            product into the X-Plane simulation world.
            Robert Randazzo of PMDG states:
            "The PMDG Classics DC-6B is the lead off product in a new
            breed of products for PMDG that will bring some "old school"
            aviation to our product lines for Xplane, FSX and Prepar3D.
            This product will drop for XPlane first- but shortly after
            will release for FSX and Prepar3D as well- making it the first
            PMDG product to appear on three different simulation
            platforms."
            A topic of discussion can be found here at X-Pilot.
            The original posting from PMDG may be found on their Facebook
            page.

SkyMaxx Pro 1.3 Update Released
            By X-Pilot, in Plugins, February 11, 2014
            [699ca2c3a024aa8504f9c5ffb8612691.jpg.259a2ff7f7a3d0bcafe1812b
            b6102ffb.jpg]
            X-Aviation and Maxx-XP have released an update for SkyMaxx
            Pro, bringing the version number to 1.3!
            This update includes further enhancements and optimizations in
            performance, including features like forced cirrus layers for
            a more realistic environment and higher resolution textures
            than in previous versions.
            You can read more about this update here.
            A list of what has been updated includes:
            Clouds faded out due to visibility are culled, to further
            improve performance
            New cumulus cloud puff textures
            Clouds should be consistent across multiple displays
            New config option to always force at least one cirrus layer
            (on by default). If no cirrus layer comes in from X-Plane's
            datarefs, we create one at 9000 meters
            Improved error handling in the event initialization fails
            Cloud visibility is generally increased
            Random variation added to cumulonimbus cloud sizes
            Prevents a source of a potential crash reported by one user
            Memory leak fixed with latest Gizmo build

X-Aviation Releases Take Command! Saab 340A!
            By Cameron, in Aircraft, September 22, 2013
            [63894e3cf09026cd6baa7f7099c75885.jpg.fe779493690a32ee756d0d16

            Leading Edge Simulations and X-Aviation are happy to announce
            the release of the long awaited Saab 340A for X-Plane 10!
            This aircraft features a study level simulation based on the
            real aircraft, custom programmed from the ground up! You can
            grab yours today at the Saab 340A product page on X-Aviation!
            The Saab 340A is entirely simulated based on the real world
            manuals. All of the systems are entirely custom programmed,
            including the autopilot, CRT displays (EHSI and EADI),
            powerplant, hydraulics and more! Our entire simulation has
            been certified as true-to-life by a test group of five real
            world Saab 340 pilots. They were amazed at our accurate
            simulation, and you will be too!
