   For some couples, finding a job that offers benefits to cover
   infertility could be the difference between having kids and not. One in
   eight couples in the United States has trouble getting pregnant and the
   cost of fertility treatments is not cheap.

   You might expect a tech company or big bank to offer coverage for
   treatments like in vitro fertilization, but Starbucks also offers the
   perk – even for part-time baristas.

   Now, some women are taking jobs there, in hopes that becoming a barista
   will get them a baby, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.

   "It was the darkest time of my life. Our marriage really took a hit,"
   said Shannon Iagulli.

   Iagulli and her husband Nic desperately wanted children. But four years
   into their marriage, it seemed Shannon couldn't get pregnant.

   "You go through your life hearing you grow up, you fall in love, you
   get married, you have kids so it doesn't happen, you don't understand.
   Why is my body not doing it," Shannon said. "And that's where Starbucks
   came in."

   Iagulli learned the company offered an unusual benefit: coverage for in
   vitro fertilization. On average, IVF costs $20,000 per cycle, with most
   couples going through two to three rounds before getting pregnant.

   "I mean, you think barista, you think 18-year-old working to go through
   school, not a 27-year-old woman trying to have a baby," Iagulli said.

   Starbucks covers $20,000 for IVF and related medication for all
   eligible employees. That includes part-time baristas who make, on
   average, about $10,000 per year.

   "It's just been part of who we are, that if you work here and you put
   in the time, you're going to get the benefits that make you a full
   partner," said Starbucks executive Lucy Helm. "It is really important
   to everyone and I think it's something that we're all very, very proud
   of. People fall in love with working for our company once they become a
   partner here."

   But business professor Craig Garthwaite, with Northwestern University's
   Kellogg school of Management, says it's not just about making employees
   happy.

   "In the end, Starbucks is a for-profit, publicly traded company.
   They're not doing this out of the goodness of their heart, this is part
   of a cohesive strategy they have for how to attract and retain talent
   and also to advertise to their customers that they are quote unquote 'a
   good company', one that you want to spend a certain amount of money
   buying coffee at when you could get that coffee potentially cheaper
   somewhere else," Garthwaite said.

   Asked if there was a business case for wanting to keep the same people
   other than just being a nice place to work, Helm said, "Absolutely, no
   question that in today's retail world in which fewer people are out and
   about shopping, places have to be a destination. So yeah, of course
   it's a business case for bringing in more customers because they
   increasingly have that connection with who we are and who serves them."

   Not everyone is happy with the company's wages and benefits: thousands
   have signed a petition online started by a barista complaining about
   understaffing and low morale.

   But count Shannon Iagulli among the happiest of Starbucks baristas. IVF
   gave the Iagullis not one baby, but two, who at six weeks old, made
   their first visit to a Starbucks, their mom's workplace.

   What she's going to tell her kids about Starbucks when they're older?

   "They will know that that's how they came about that if it wasn't for
   mommy going to make coffee that they wouldn't be here," Iagulli said.

   Now, she supports other hopeful barista-moms around the country.
   They've even got a Facebook group called -- what else -- Starbucks IVF
   Mommas.

   Starbucks says it doesn't know how many women are doing this.

   For the Iagullis, after insurance, they only ended up paying about
   $2,300 out of pocket.

   After getting pregnant last year, Iagulli left Starbucks for another
   job. Now she says, come this fall, when the twins are a little older,
   she'd like to go back. They need the health benefits for the family,
   plus she and her husband want to have more kids.

       year, its stock price soaring 163% in mere weeks.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gone are the days when vegan meat was derided as tasteless — a
   sacrifice vegetarians made in service of a greater environmental cause.
   Today's meatless meats taste just like the real thing, can satisfy the
   most blood-thirsty of carnivores, and are here to stay.

   After testing its plant-based whopper in a Burger King location in
   April, plant-based food company Impossible Foods is going nationwide
   with the fast food chain in more than 7,000 locations.

   When competitor plant-based substitute company Beyond Meat went public
   in early May, its stock price soared 163% in a day. The money-losing
   company is now valued at about $4 billion, making it the most
   successful IPO thus far this year.

   Investors, celebrities and consumers are all taking notice. Impossible
   Foods announced Monday that it raised $300 million in its latest round
   of private funding, the largest ever haul for a plant-based meat
   company, according to the Good Food Institute. The Silicon Valley
   start-up has raised about $750 million since its founding in 2011.

   It also has a slew of health-conscious and environmentally-minded
   celebrity investors, including Alexis Ohanian, Jaden Smith, Jay-Z, Katy
   Perry, Serena Williams and Zedd. While Lee said Impossible Foods does
   not pay for promotions, some celebrities have gone out of their way to
   give the food company a shout-out, like Katy Perry, who changed into an
   Impossible Burger costume at the Met Gala this year.

   Despite Beyond Meat's success going public, Impossible Foods CFO David
   Lee insisted Wednesday to CBS News the company has no plans to announce
   an IPO and is focusing instead on trying to meet the surge of demand on
   the heels of its Burger King expansion.

   "Frankly, we're not in a rush to go public. We're very, very focused on
   serving our meat eaters well and increasing our supply," Lee said.

   The company is planning to hire 50 new employees to its Oakland,
   California, facility, which already employs 70 full-time workers, to
   help meet the increase in demand.

Meatless meat a sizzling hot industry

   Investor interest in meatless alternative companies like Beyond Meat
   and Impossible Foods mirror the surge in interest in plant-based
   alternatives in the U.S. Of the $16 billion invested into U.S.
   plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies in the past decade, $13
   billion flowed in 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the Good Food
   Institute.

   "Investors and entrepreneurs are capitalizing on a global shift in the
   way meat is produced. The market opportunity here is massive," Bruce
   Friedrich, executive director at the Good Food Institute, said in a
   statement.

   Alternative meat companies hope to replicate the success of the
   non-dairy milk industry, which has grown to about 13% of the milk
   market by positioning itself as the healthier alternative. Beyond Meat
   said in its filings that the vegan meat market can similarly grow to
   about $35 billion of the $250 billion domestic meat industry.

   That means that Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat may become leaders in
   a fast-growing and highly competitive space. For example, poultry giant
   Tyson has made investments int Jerusalem-based Future Meat Technologies
   and lab-grown meat producer Memphis Meats.

   "There will be multiple winners," Lee predicted.

Environmentally-conscious, but is it good to eat?

   Part of Impossible Foods' and Beyond Meat's success comes from
   marketing their product to meat lovers, as opposed to vegans, who make
   up just 5% of Americans, according to Beyond Meat in its SEC filings.

   Both companies have gone to considerable lengths and spent hefty
   capital to ensure their beef patties mimic the real thing in taste and
   texture. Beyond Meat, which makes pea protein the base of its products,
   also uses beet juice to help achieve the look of meat.

   Meanwhile, Impossible Foods isolated an iron-rich molecule called
   "heme" from soy plants to achieve the beefy, meaty taste of meat,
   famously making its veggie patties "bleed."

   However, some health experts criticize processed alternative burger
   products for not being all that health-conscious. While Impossible
   Foods CFO Lee said the vegan patties are environmentally friendly and
   use less land, less water, and produce less greenhouse gases than
   animal products, some nutritionists say they're not necessarily healthy
   for consumers.

   For diners who may be looking to make the switch to plant-based for
   health reasons, like lowering their salt or fat intake, the Impossible
   Burger is not notably healthier. It has zero cholesterol and about the
   same saturated fat as a traditional beef patty, but more than four
   times the amount of sodium.

   "If you want a plant-based option that has that burger taste, the
   Impossible Burger is your option — but it does come with similar
   amounts of fat and calories," Connie Diekman, director of university
   nutrition at Washington University, said in a statement when the patty
   was tested in St. Louis Burger King locations in April.

   "But if you are trying to to increase the amount of plant protein in
   your diet, this should just be one part of a bigger portfolio of
   options," she continued.

   Diekman said bean burgers are typically a healthier option with more
   fiber, nutrients and less fat.

Horrified mom discovers suicide instructions in video on YouTube and YouTube
Kids

   By Sophie Lewis

   February 23, 2019 / 2:53 PM / CBS News

   Warning: This article features disturbing content and mentions of
   suicide.

   Video promoting self-harm tips -- spliced between clips of a popular
   video game — has surfaced at least twice on YouTube and YouTube Kids
   since July, according to a pediatrician and mom who discovered the
   video.

   The suicide instructions are sandwiched between clips from the popular
   Nintendo game Splatoon and delivered by a man speaking in front of what
   appears to be a green screen — an apparent effort to have him blend in
   with the rest of the animated video.

   "Remember kids, sideways for attention, longways for results," the man
   says, miming cutting motions on his forearm. "End it."

   The man featured is YouTuber Filthy Frank, who has over 6.2 million
   subscribers and calls himself "the embodiment of everything a person
   should not be," although there is no evidence that Frank, whose real
   name is George Miller, was involved in creating the doctored video. He
   did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.

   When Free Hess found the video on YouTube last week, she posted it on
   her blog -- warning other parents to take control over what their kids
   may be watching.

   "Looking at the comments, it had been up for a while, and people had
   even reported it eight months prior," Hess told CBS News on Friday.

   Shortly after she published her blog post, YouTube took the video down,
   saying it violated the site's community guidelines, according to Hess.

   Hess said she spotted another version of the same video on YouTube Kids
   in July last year. She said she and many other parents from Facebook
   groups came together to report it, and the video was eventually taken
   down after one parent directly contacted an employee at Google. Google
   has not responded to CBS News' inquiry about the steps that led to the
   video's removal.

   Hess said after seeing higher rates of suicide in children in her own
   emergency room over the last few years, she made it her mission to
   bring awareness to disturbing and violent content being consumed by
   children on social media. She said she's reported hundreds of
   unsettling videos to YouTube, with some success. On Friday, she found
   and reported seven more disturbing videos on YouTube Kids, and said
   they were just the tip of the iceberg.

   "I had to stop, but I could have kept going," Hess said. "Once you
   start looking into it, things get darker and weirder. I don't
   understand how it's not getting caught."

   YouTube Kids is meant to be a kid-friendly version of YouTube site for
   children who are 8 years old and under, but trolls have founds ways
   around YouTube's algorithm and are posting potentially harmful videos.

   "They're awful. Absolutely awful," Hess said about some of the content
   on the YouTube Kids app.

   She said she logs onto the app posing as a child, rather than an adult,
   so that she can see exactly what kids around the world are seeing. The
   videos Hess has found contain mentions or visuals of self-harm,
   suicide, sexual exploitation, trafficking, domestic violence, sexual
   abuse and gun violence, including a simulated school shooting. She said
   many of the kids she treats in the ER list videos on YouTube as a
   method used to learn destructive behaviors and self-harm techniques.

   A YouTube spokesperson told CBS News on Friday the site works hard "to
   ensure YouTube is not used to encourage dangerous behavior." The
   spokesperson also said YouTube has "strict policies" that prohibit
   videos that promote self-harm.

   "We rely on both user flagging and smart detection technology to flag
   this content for our reviewers," the spokesperson said. "Every quarter
   we remove millions of videos and channels that violate our policies and
   we remove the majority of these videos before they have any views. We
   are always working to improve our systems and to remove violative
   content more quickly, which is why we report our progress in a
   quarterly report and give users a dashboard showing the status of
   videos they've flagged to us."

   However, YouTube kids has a history of letting disturbing and violent
   videos slipping past its algorithms. In 2017, searching the word "gun"
   on the app surfaced a video on how to build a coil gun, Mashable
   reported. Other videos at the time featured Mickey Mouse in a pool of
   blood and Spider-Man urinating on Elsa, the princess from "Frozen,"
   prompting backlash.

   "The YouTube Kids team is made up of parents who care deeply about
   this, so it's extremely important for us to get this right, and we act
   quickly when videos are brought to our attention," a YouTube
   spokeswoman told CNET at the time. "We agree this content is
   unacceptable and are committed to making the app better every day."

   Since the backlash in 2017, YouTube has outlined steps it is taking to
   improve safety on its Kids app. In November 2017, the company outlined
   a new set of guidelines, including "faster enforcement" of community
   guidelines and "blocking inappropriate comments." In April last year,
   YouTube announced three new parental control features to give parents
   the ability to curate what their child is seeing on the app. There are
   also a number of other ways for parents to make the app safer, but non
   of them are automatic.

   This week, new cases of inappropriate content prompted high-profile
   responses, including from Disney and Nestle, which pulled advertising
   from YouTube after a blogger described "a wormhole into a soft-core
   pedophilia ring" on the site.

   YouTube said Thursday it was taking aggressive action, banning more
   than 400 accounts and taking down dozens of videos.

   Critics say its approach to safety across platforms just isn't working.

     UPDATE: @YouTube @YTCreators left a comment and provided an update
     on what they’ve done to combat horrible people on the site in the
     last 48 hours.

     TLDR: Disabled comments on tens of millions of videos. Terminated
     over 400 channels. Reported illegal comments to law enforcement.

   Parents remain concerned about safety both on YouTube and YouTube Kids.
   "We should start by educating ourselves, educating our children, and
   speaking up when we see something that is dangerous for our children,"
   Hess wrote on her blog. "We also need to fight to have the developers
   of social media platforms held responsible when they do not assure that
   age restrictions are followed and when they do not remove inappropriate
   and/or dangerous material when reported."

   On America's college campuses, there are epidemics we talk about and

   headlines, court cases follow and new rules are enacted, but less

   Originals explores how drinking to excess is not only considered
   normal, but cool, and how for many young people "blacking out" is less
   a rarity than an every weekend occurrence – with grave consequences.

Will self-driving cars put cab drivers, truckers out of business?

     *

   November 3, 2016 / 3:22 PM / AP

   Ronald De Feo has watched robots take factory jobs for years. Now he
   sees them threatening a new class of worker: People who drive for a
   living.

   Tesla announces fully self-driving cars

   “I am in Pittsburgh; it’s a test market for Uber’s autonomous vehicle,”
   says De Feo, CEO of the industrial materials firm Kennametal. “We see
   all these (automated) Ubers running around the streets of Pittsburgh, a
   confusing and difficult place to navigate. If they can make that work,
   what do you think happens to the job of being a taxi driver?”

   Computer scientists and economists say the threat isn’t merely
   theoretical: Automated cars pose an existential threat to the many
   Americans who drive for a living: 2.9 million truckers and delivery
   drivers, 674,000 bus drivers, 181,000 cab drivers and chauffeurs.

   The big question is how long it will take auto and tech companies to
   clear the technical hurdles to turning the streets over to driverless
   cars.

   “I don’t see herds of robotic trucks running down the highway in the
   next few years,” says Vern Meyerotto, a 61-year-old truck driver in
   Denver. “There’s an awful lot of development that needs to be done on
   it.”

   Meyerotto, who’s been driving since 2007, points to the self-driving
   Tesla Model S car that crashed in May, killing the driver, after the
   car’s cameras failed to detect a tractor-trailer crossing its path. He
   doesn’t expect to see robotic trucks doing much driving for 10 or 15
   more years.

   But the quick development of driverless cars has caught economists by
   surprise.

   Uber buys big rig company in self-driving tech push

   Assessing which jobs were vulnerable to robots in a 2004 book,
   economists Frank Levy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
   Richard Murnane of Harvard University reckoned that truck drivers were
   safe. Surely, a machine couldn’t negotiate rush-hour traffic without a
   helping human hand.

   Six years later, Google’s automated cars were on the road, crossing the
   Golden Gate Bridge, circling Lake Tahoe and cruising down Hollywood
   Boulevard.

   Now, companies from Ford to Tesla to Uber are investing in automated
   car technology.

   “The next big wave of automation will apply to driving,” says Moshe
   Vardi, a computer scientist at Rice University.

   Vardi suspects that truck drivers will be the first victims. Automated
   trucks can be programmed to go from one warehouse to another, plying
   express lanes reserved for trucks that let them avoid interacting with
   human drivers.

   Vardi notes that vulnerable truckers have much in common with the
   factory workers who’ve been ousted by machines over the past several
   decades: They tend to be white men, middle-aged or older, with high
   school-only educations — the people who’ve formed the core support for
   Donald Trump.

   “These things do not happen without political consequences,” Vardi
   says.

   Should driverless cars make ethical decisions?

   Uber, which has been testing driverless taxis in Pittsburgh, disputes
   the notion that automated cars will cost the economy jobs.

   “Technology also creates new work opportunities while disrupting
   existing ones,” Travis Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, and Anthony Levandowski,
   its vice president for self-driving technology, said in a statement.

   For example: “Self-driving Ubers will be on the road 24 hours a day,
   which means they will need a lot more human maintenance.”

   A 25-year veteran cabbie who goes by A. Tucker was sitting in his
   Peoples Cab outside the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Pittsburgh. He worked in
   a Jones & Laughlin steel mill for six years before he was laid off and
   started driving a cab. He said he fears that driverless cars will
   eventually compete with guys like him.

   “If you flip the coin to the other side, it was like the steel
   industry,” Tucker said. “We thought we would never lose our jobs to
   automation. But we lost our jobs, and many of us are driving cabs now.”

   Cab drivers have been forced to become more professional, tech-savvy
   and educated to compete, because they now use tablet computers, credit
   card processors and GPS, Tucker said.

   “Change is inevitable, whether we like it or not,” he said. “That’s
   life on the Earth moving forward.”

   Some drivers are responding to the threat with grim humor. Upon hearing
   that a driverless truck had crossed Colorado with a load of beer last
   week, one commentator on the online Truckers Forum posted a reference
   to the killer computer network in the Terminator movies:

   “Skynet is active.”

Postcard From Patagonia: Creating a national park

   Located in the southern tip of Chile, Patagonia National Park is more
   than half-a-million acres of mountains and valleys, glaciers and
   grasslands, winding rivers and wild guanacos – and it is part of the
   largest private land donation in history. Conor Knighton trekked the
   wilds of the park with Kristine Tompkins, former CEO of the clothing
   company Patagonia, whose non-profit, Tompkins Conservation, handed over
   this park to the Chilean government to preserve its wild-ness for
   generations to come. It's a dream that has been two-and-a-half decades
   in the making, and the culmination of a remarkable love story.

   most recently with the album "Down the Road Wherever." And as he wraps

   The number of mass shootings across the U.S. thus far in 2019 has
   outpaced the number of days this year, according to a gun violence
   research group. This puts 2019 on pace to be the first year since 2016
   with an average of more than one mass shooting a day.

   As of September 1, which was the 244th day of the year, there have been
   283 mass shootings in the U.S., according to data from the nonprofit
   Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which tracks every mass shooting in the
   country. The GVA defines a mass shooting as any incident in which at
   least four people were shot, excluding the shooter.

   The toll of 283 mass shootings includes several high-profile, mass
   casualty attacks, two of which happened within 24 hours of each other:
     * A drive-by shooting spree in Odessa and Midland, Texas, on August
       31, with seven people killed and 24 wounded

     * A shooting in a historic district of Dayton, Ohio, on August 4,
       with nine people killed and 27 injured.

     * A shooting at Walmart in El Paso, Texas, on August 3, with 22
       people killed and at least 24 wounded. It was the deadliest
       shooting of the year.

     * A shooting in a municipal building in Virginia Beach, on May 31,
       where a former city employee killed 12 people and wounded four.

   The GVA said there have been 37,662 total shooting incidents, resulting
   in 9,932 gun deaths and 19,868 injuries, as of September 1.

     * Trial begins for cop who shot man in his own apartment
     * There have been more mass shootings than days in 2019

   The last time the mass shooting toll topped days of the year was 2016,
   which had 382 mass shootings — the most in any year since the Gun
   Violence Archive started keeping track. The past two years came close,
   with 346 mass shootings in 2017 and 340 in 2018.

Drinking culture and American kids

   On America's college campuses, there are epidemics we talk about and
   those we don't. When sexual assaults or fraternity hazing deaths make
   headlines, court cases follow and new rules are enacted, but less
   attention is paid to an underlying issue – binge drinking culture. CBSN
   Originals explores how drinking to excess is not only considered
   normal, but cool, and how for many young people "blacking out" is less
   a rarity than an every weekend occurrence – with grave consequences.

   For some couples, finding a job that offers benefits to cover
   infertility could be the difference between having kids and not. One in
   eight couples in the United States has trouble getting pregnant and the
   cost of fertility treatments is not cheap.

   You might expect a tech company or big bank to offer coverage for
   treatments like in vitro fertilization, but Starbucks also offers the
   perk – even for part-time baristas.

   Now, some women are taking jobs there, in hopes that becoming a barista
   will get them a baby, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.

   "It was the darkest time of my life. Our marriage really took a hit,"
   said Shannon Iagulli.

   Iagulli and her husband Nic desperately wanted children. But four years
   into their marriage, it seemed Shannon couldn't get pregnant.

   "You go through your life hearing you grow up, you fall in love, you
   get married, you have kids so it doesn't happen, you don't understand.
   Why is my body not doing it," Shannon said. "And that's where Starbucks
   came in."

   Iagulli learned the company offered an unusual benefit: coverage for in
   vitro fertilization. On average, IVF costs $20,000 per cycle, with most
   couples going through two to three rounds before getting pregnant.

   "I mean, you think barista, you think 18-year-old working to go through
   school, not a 27-year-old woman trying to have a baby," Iagulli said.

   Starbucks covers $20,000 for IVF and related medication for all
   eligible employees. That includes part-time baristas who make, on
   average, about $10,000 per year.

   "It's just been part of who we are, that if you work here and you put
   in the time, you're going to get the benefits that make you a full
   partner," said Starbucks executive Lucy Helm. "It is really important
   to everyone and I think it's something that we're all very, very proud
   of. People fall in love with working for our company once they become a
   partner here."

   But business professor Craig Garthwaite, with Northwestern University's
   Kellogg school of Management, says it's not just about making employees
   happy.

   "In the end, Starbucks is a for-profit, publicly traded company.
   They're not doing this out of the goodness of their heart, this is part
   of a cohesive strategy they have for how to attract and retain talent
   and also to advertise to their customers that they are quote unquote 'a
   good company', one that you want to spend a certain amount of money
   buying coffee at when you could get that coffee potentially cheaper
   somewhere else," Garthwaite said.

   Asked if there was a business case for wanting to keep the same people
   other than just being a nice place to work, Helm said, "Absolutely, no
   question that in today's retail world in which fewer people are out and
   about shopping, places have to be a destination. So yeah, of course
   it's a business case for bringing in more customers because they
   increasingly have that connection with who we are and who serves them."

   Not everyone is happy with the company's wages and benefits: thousands
   have signed a petition online started by a barista complaining about
   understaffing and low morale.

   But count Shannon Iagulli among the happiest of Starbucks baristas. IVF
   gave the Iagullis not one baby, but two, who at six weeks old, made
   their first visit to a Starbucks, their mom's workplace.

   What she's going to tell her kids about Starbucks when they're older?

   "They will know that that's how they came about that if it wasn't for
   mommy going to make coffee that they wouldn't be here," Iagulli said.

   Now, she supports other hopeful barista-moms around the country.
   They've even got a Facebook group called -- what else -- Starbucks IVF
   Mommas.

   Starbucks says it doesn't know how many women are doing this.

   For the Iagullis, after insurance, they only ended up paying about
   $2,300 out of pocket.

   After getting pregnant last year, Iagulli left Starbucks for another
   job. Now she says, come this fall, when the twins are a little older,
   she'd like to go back. They need the health benefits for the family,
   plus she and her husband want to have more kids.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Gone are the days when vegan meat was derided as tasteless — a
   sacrifice vegetarians made in service of a greater environmental cause.
   Today's meatless meats taste just like the real thing, can satisfy the
   most blood-thirsty of carnivores, and are here to stay.

   After testing its plant-based whopper in a Burger King location in
   April, plant-based food company Impossible Foods is going nationwide
   with the fast food chain in more than 7,000 locations.

   When competitor plant-based substitute company Beyond Meat went public
   in early May, its stock price soared 163% in a day. The money-losing
   company is now valued at about $4 billion, making it the most
   successful IPO thus far this year.

   Investors, celebrities and consumers are all taking notice. Impossible
   Foods announced Monday that it raised $300 million in its latest round
   of private funding, the largest ever haul for a plant-based meat
   company, according to the Good Food Institute. The Silicon Valley
   start-up has raised about $750 million since its founding in 2011.

   It also has a slew of health-conscious and environmentally-minded
   celebrity investors, including Alexis Ohanian, Jaden Smith, Jay-Z, Katy
   Perry, Serena Williams and Zedd. While Lee said Impossible Foods does
   not pay for promotions, some celebrities have gone out of their way to
   give the food company a shout-out, like Katy Perry, who changed into an
   Impossible Burger costume at the Met Gala this year.

   Despite Beyond Meat's success going public, Impossible Foods CFO David
   Lee insisted Wednesday to CBS News the company has no plans to announce
   an IPO and is focusing instead on trying to meet the surge of demand on
   the heels of its Burger King expansion.

   "Frankly, we're not in a rush to go public. We're very, very focused on
   serving our meat eaters well and increasing our supply," Lee said.

   The company is planning to hire 50 new employees to its Oakland,
   California, facility, which already employs 70 full-time workers, to
   help meet the increase in demand.

Meatless meat a sizzling hot industry

   Investor interest in meatless alternative companies like Beyond Meat
   and Impossible Foods mirror the surge in interest in plant-based
   alternatives in the U.S. Of the $16 billion invested into U.S.
   plant-based meat, egg, and dairy companies in the past decade, $13
   billion flowed in 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the Good Food
   Institute.

   "Investors and entrepreneurs are capitalizing on a global shift in the
   way meat is produced. The market opportunity here is massive," Bruce
   Friedrich, executive director at the Good Food Institute, said in a
   statement.

   Alternative meat companies hope to replicate the success of the
   non-dairy milk industry, which has grown to about 13% of the milk
   market by positioning itself as the healthier alternative. Beyond Meat
   said in its filings that the vegan meat market can similarly grow to
   about $35 billion of the $250 billion domestic meat industry.

   That means that Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat may become leaders in
   a fast-growing and highly competitive space. For example, poultry giant
   Tyson has made investments int Jerusalem-based Future Meat Technologies
   and lab-grown meat producer Memphis Meats.

   "There will be multiple winners," Lee predicted.

Environmentally-conscious, but is it good to eat?

   Part of Impossible Foods' and Beyond Meat's success comes from
   marketing their product to meat lovers, as opposed to vegans, who make
   up just 5% of Americans, according to Beyond Meat in its SEC filings.

   Both companies have gone to considerable lengths and spent hefty
   capital to ensure their beef patties mimic the real thing in taste and
   texture. Beyond Meat, which makes pea protein the base of its products,
   also uses beet juice to help achieve the look of meat.

   Meanwhile, Impossible Foods isolated an iron-rich molecule called
   "heme" from soy plants to achieve the beefy, meaty taste of meat,
   famously making its veggie patties "bleed."

   However, some health experts criticize processed alternative burger
   products for not being all that health-conscious. While Impossible
   Foods CFO Lee said the vegan patties are environmentally friendly and
   use less land, less water, and produce less greenhouse gases than
   animal products, some nutritionists say they're not necessarily healthy
   for consumers.

   For diners who may be looking to make the switch to plant-based for
   health reasons, like lowering their salt or fat intake, the Impossible
   Burger is not notably healthier. It has zero cholesterol and about the
   same saturated fat as a traditional beef patty, but more than four
   times the amount of sodium.

   "If you want a plant-based option that has that burger taste, the
   Impossible Burger is your option — but it does come with similar
   amounts of fat and calories," Connie Diekman, director of university
   nutrition at Washington University, said in a statement when the patty
   was tested in St. Louis Burger King locations in April.

   "But if you are trying to to increase the amount of plant protein in
   your diet, this should just be one part of a bigger portfolio of
   options," she continued.

   Diekman said bean burgers are typically a healthier option with more
   fiber, nutrients and less fat.

Horrified mom discovers suicide instructions in video on YouTube and YouTube
Kids

     *
     *
     *

   By Sophie Lewis

   February 23, 2019 / 2:53 PM / CBS News

   Warning: This article features disturbing content and mentions of
   suicide.

   Video promoting self-harm tips -- spliced between clips of a popular
   video game — has surfaced at least twice on YouTube and YouTube Kids
   since July, according to a pediatrician and mom who discovered the
   video.

   The suicide instructions are sandwiched between clips from the popular
   Nintendo game Splatoon and delivered by a man speaking in front of what
   appears to be a green screen — an apparent effort to have him blend in
   with the rest of the animated video.

       school

     * CEO stuns employees by giving them each a $10,000 raise

   "Remember kids, sideways for attention, longways for results," the man
   says, miming cutting motions on his forearm. "End it."

   The man featured is YouTuber Filthy Frank, who has over 6.2 million
   subscribers and calls himself "the embodiment of everything a person
   should not be," although there is no evidence that Frank, whose real
   name is George Miller, was involved in creating the doctored video. He
   did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.

   When Free Hess found the video on YouTube last week, she posted it on
   her blog -- warning other parents to take control over what their kids
   may be watching.

   "Looking at the comments, it had been up for a while, and people had
   even reported it eight months prior," Hess told CBS News on Friday.

   Shortly after she published her blog post, YouTube took the video down,
   saying it violated the site's community guidelines, according to Hess.

   Hess said she spotted another version of the same video on YouTube Kids
   in July last year. She said she and many other parents from Facebook
   groups came together to report it, and the video was eventually taken
   down after one parent directly contacted an employee at Google. Google
   has not responded to CBS News' inquiry about the steps that led to the
   video's removal.

   Hess said after seeing higher rates of suicide in children in her own
   emergency room over the last few years, she made it her mission to
   bring awareness to disturbing and violent content being consumed by
   children on social media. She said she's reported hundreds of
   unsettling videos to YouTube, with some success. On Friday, she found
   and reported seven more disturbing videos on YouTube Kids, and said
   they were just the tip of the iceberg.

   "I had to stop, but I could have kept going," Hess said. "Once you
   start looking into it, things get darker and weirder. I don't
   understand how it's not getting caught."

   YouTube Kids is meant to be a kid-friendly version of YouTube site for
   children who are 8 years old and under, but trolls have founds ways
   around YouTube's algorithm and are posting potentially harmful videos.

   "They're awful. Absolutely awful," Hess said about some of the content
   on the YouTube Kids app.

   She said she logs onto the app posing as a child, rather than an adult,
   so that she can see exactly what kids around the world are seeing. The
   videos Hess has found contain mentions or visuals of self-harm,
   suicide, sexual exploitation, trafficking, domestic violence, sexual
   abuse and gun violence, including a simulated school shooting. She said
   many of the kids she treats in the ER list videos on YouTube as a
   method used to learn destructive behaviors and self-harm techniques.

   A YouTube spokesperson told CBS News on Friday the site works hard "to
   ensure YouTube is not used to encourage dangerous behavior." The
   spokesperson also said YouTube has "strict policies" that prohibit
   videos that promote self-harm.

   "We rely on both user flagging and smart detection technology to flag
   this content for our reviewers," the spokesperson said. "Every quarter
   we remove millions of videos and channels that violate our policies and
   we remove the majority of these videos before they have any views. We
   are always working to improve our systems and to remove violative
   content more quickly, which is why we report our progress in a
   quarterly report and give users a dashboard showing the status of
   videos they've flagged to us."

   However, YouTube kids has a history of letting disturbing and violent
   videos slipping past its algorithms. In 2017, searching the word "gun"
   on the app surfaced a video on how to build a coil gun, Mashable
   reported. Other videos at the time featured Mickey Mouse in a pool of
   blood and Spider-Man urinating on Elsa, the princess from "Frozen,"
   prompting backlash.

   "The YouTube Kids team is made up of parents who care deeply about
   this, so it's extremely important for us to get this right, and we act
   quickly when videos are brought to our attention," a YouTube
   spokeswoman told CNET at the time. "We agree this content is
   unacceptable and are committed to making the app better every day."

   Since the backlash in 2017, YouTube has outlined steps it is taking to
   improve safety on its Kids app. In November 2017, the company outlined
   a new set of guidelines, including "faster enforcement" of community
   guidelines and "blocking inappropriate comments." In April last year,
   YouTube announced three new parental control features to give parents
   the ability to curate what their child is seeing on the app. There are
   also a number of other ways for parents to make the app safer, but non
   of them are automatic.

   This week, new cases of inappropriate content prompted high-profile
   responses, including from Disney and Nestle, which pulled advertising
   from YouTube after a blogger described "a wormhole into a soft-core
   pedophilia ring" on the site.

   YouTube said Thursday it was taking aggressive action, banning more
   than 400 accounts and taking down dozens of videos.

   Critics say its approach to safety across platforms just isn't working.

     UPDATE: @YouTube @YTCreators left a comment and provided an update
     on what they’ve done to combat horrible people on the site in the
     last 48 hours.

     TLDR: Disabled comments on tens of millions of videos. Terminated
     over 400 channels. Reported illegal comments to law enforcement.

     — Philip DeFranco (@PhillyD) February 21, 2019

   Parents remain concerned about safety both on YouTube and YouTube Kids.
   "We should start by educating ourselves, educating our children, and
   speaking up when we see something that is dangerous for our children,"
   Hess wrote on her blog. "We also need to fight to have the developers
   of social media platforms held responsible when they do not assure that
   age restrictions are followed and when they do not remove inappropriate
   and/or dangerous material when reported."

   Originals explores how drinking to excess is not only considered
   normal, but cool, and how for many young people "blacking out" is less

Will self-driving cars put cab drivers, truckers out of business?

     *
     *
     *

   November 3, 2016 / 3:22 PM / AP

   Ronald De Feo has watched robots take factory jobs for years. Now he
   sees them threatening a new class of worker: People who drive for a
   living.

   Tesla announces fully self-driving cars

   “I am in Pittsburgh; it’s a test market for Uber’s autonomous vehicle,”
   says De Feo, CEO of the industrial materials firm Kennametal. “We see
   all these (automated) Ubers running around the streets of Pittsburgh, a
   confusing and difficult place to navigate. If they can make that work,
   what do you think happens to the job of being a taxi driver?”

   Computer scientists and economists say the threat isn’t merely
   theoretical: Automated cars pose an existential threat to the many
   Americans who drive for a living: 2.9 million truckers and delivery
   drivers, 674,000 bus drivers, 181,000 cab drivers and chauffeurs.

   The big question is how long it will take auto and tech companies to
   clear the technical hurdles to turning the streets over to driverless
   cars.

   “I don’t see herds of robotic trucks running down the highway in the
   next few years,” says Vern Meyerotto, a 61-year-old truck driver in
   Denver. “There’s an awful lot of development that needs to be done on
   it.”

   Meyerotto, who’s been driving since 2007, points to the self-driving
   Tesla Model S car that crashed in May, killing the driver, after the
   car’s cameras failed to detect a tractor-trailer crossing its path. He
   doesn’t expect to see robotic trucks doing much driving for 10 or 15
   more years.

   But the quick development of driverless cars has caught economists by
   surprise.

   Uber buys big rig company in self-driving tech push

   Assessing which jobs were vulnerable to robots in a 2004 book,
   economists Frank Levy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
   Richard Murnane of Harvard University reckoned that truck drivers were
   safe. Surely, a machine couldn’t negotiate rush-hour traffic without a
   helping human hand.

   Six years later, Google’s automated cars were on the road, crossing the
   Golden Gate Bridge, circling Lake Tahoe and cruising down Hollywood
   Boulevard.

   Now, companies from Ford to Tesla to Uber are investing in automated
   car technology.

   “The next big wave of automation will apply to driving,” says Moshe
   Vardi, a computer scientist at Rice University.

   Vardi suspects that truck drivers will be the first victims. Automated
   trucks can be programmed to go from one warehouse to another, plying
   express lanes reserved for trucks that let them avoid interacting with
   human drivers.

   Vardi notes that vulnerable truckers have much in common with the
   factory workers who’ve been ousted by machines over the past several
   decades: They tend to be white men, middle-aged or older, with high
   school-only educations — the people who’ve formed the core support for
   Donald Trump.

   “These things do not happen without political consequences,” Vardi
   says.

   Should driverless cars make ethical decisions?

   Uber, which has been testing driverless taxis in Pittsburgh, disputes
   the notion that automated cars will cost the economy jobs.

   “Technology also creates new work opportunities while disrupting
   existing ones,” Travis Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, and Anthony Levandowski,
   its vice president for self-driving technology, said in a statement.

   For example: “Self-driving Ubers will be on the road 24 hours a day,
   which means they will need a lot more human maintenance.”

   A 25-year veteran cabbie who goes by A. Tucker was sitting in his
   Peoples Cab outside the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Pittsburgh. He worked in
   a Jones & Laughlin steel mill for six years before he was laid off and
   started driving a cab. He said he fears that driverless cars will
   eventually compete with guys like him.

   “If you flip the coin to the other side, it was like the steel
   industry,” Tucker said. “We thought we would never lose our jobs to
   automation. But we lost our jobs, and many of us are driving cabs now.”

   Cab drivers have been forced to become more professional, tech-savvy
   and educated to compete, because they now use tablet computers, credit
   card processors and GPS, Tucker said.

   “Change is inevitable, whether we like it or not,” he said. “That’s
   life on the Earth moving forward.”

   Some drivers are responding to the threat with grim humor. Upon hearing
   that a driverless truck had crossed Colorado with a load of beer last
   week, one commentator on the online Truckers Forum posted a reference
   to the killer computer network in the Terminator movies:

   “Skynet is active.”

Composer John Williams

   Composer John Williams is one of America's most celebrated musical
   talents – the best-known creator of music for films. He has written the
   scores for such revered classics as "Jaws," "Star Wars," "Superman" and
   "Schindler's List," and is returning to the "Star Wars" universe with
   the upcoming "Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker." Correspondent Tracy
   Smith talks with Williams, and with violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, who
   collaborated with the composer on a new album of works for violin and
   orchestra adapted from his film scores, "Across the Stars."

Postcard From Patagonia: Creating a national park

   Located in the southern tip of Chile, Patagonia National Park is more
   than half-a-million acres of mountains and valleys, glaciers and
   grasslands, winding rivers and wild guanacos – and it is part of the
   largest private land donation in history. Conor Knighton trekked the
   wilds of the park with Kristine Tompkins, former CEO of the clothing
   company Patagonia, whose non-profit, Tompkins Conservation, handed over
   this park to the Chilean government to preserve its wild-ness for
   generations to come. It's a dream that has been two-and-a-half decades
   in the making, and the culmination of a remarkable love story.

For The Record: Mark Knopfler

   Mark Knopfler says he can't think of anything good about fame, which is
   one reason he dissolved his hit band, Dire Straits, when they were at
   the peak of their success in the 1980s. But he continues to make music,
   most recently with the album "Down the Road Wherever." And as he wraps
   a tour of America, Knopfler sat down with Anthony Mason to talk about
   the music he has written, for himself and others, and why he calls it
   his obsession.

   The number of mass shootings across the U.S. thus far in 2019 has
   outpaced the number of days this year, according to a gun violence
   research group. This puts 2019 on pace to be the first year since 2016
   with an average of more than one mass shooting a day.

   As of September 1, which was the 244th day of the year, there have been
   283 mass shootings in the U.S., according to data from the nonprofit
   Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which tracks every mass shooting in the
   country. The GVA defines a mass shooting as any incident in which at
   least four people were shot, excluding the shooter.

   The toll of 283 mass shootings includes several high-profile, mass
   casualty attacks, two of which happened within 24 hours of each other:
     * A drive-by shooting spree in Odessa and Midland, Texas, on August
       31, with seven people killed and 24 wounded

     * A shooting in a historic district of Dayton, Ohio, on August 4,
       with nine people killed and 27 injured.

     * A shooting at Walmart in El Paso, Texas, on August 3, with 22
       people killed and at least 24 wounded. It was the deadliest
       shooting of the year.

     * A shooting in a municipal building in Virginia Beach, on May 31,
       where a former city employee killed 12 people and wounded four.

   The GVA said there have been 37,662 total shooting incidents, resulting
   in 9,932 gun deaths and 19,868 injuries, as of September 1.

   The last time the mass shooting toll topped days of the year was 2016,
   which had 382 mass shootings — the most in any year since the Gun
   Violence Archive started keeping track. The past two years came close,
   with 346 mass shootings in 2017 and 340 in 2018.

   The following is a script of "Chernobyl" which aired on Nov. 23, 2014.
   Bob Simon is the correspondent. Michael Gavshon and David Levine,
   producers.

   Some tragedies never end. Ask people to name a nuclear disaster and
   most will probably point to Fukushima in Japan three years ago. The
   nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl in Ukraine was 30 years ago, but the
   crisis is still with us today. That's because radiation virtually never
   dies. After the explosion in 1986, the Soviets built a primitive
   sarcophagus, a tomb to cover the stricken reactor. But it wasn't meant
   to last very long and it hasn't. Engineers say there is still enough
   radioactive material in there to cause widespread contamination. For
   the last five years a massive project has been underway to seal the
   reactor permanently. But the undertaking is three quarters of a billion
   dollars short and the completion date has been delayed repeatedly.
   Thirty years later, Chernobyl's crippled reactor still has the power to
   kill.

   It's called the Zone and getting into it is crossing a border into one
   of the most contaminated places on Earth. The 20-mile no man's land was
   evacuated nearly 30 years ago. Drive to the center of the Zone today
   and you'll see a massive structure that appears to rise out of nowhere.
   It's an engineering effort the likes of which the world has never seen.
   With funds from over 40 different countries, 1,400 workers are building
   a giant arch to cover the damaged reactor like a casserole. It will be
   taller than the Statue of Liberty and wider than Yankee Stadium -- the
   largest movable structure on Earth. Nicholas Caille is overseeing the
   arch's construction.

   Bob Simon: You know when you think about it, you have this massive
   project going on. All these people working here. Billions of dollars
   being spent because of one day 30 years ago.

   Nicolas Caille: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. It was the biggest
   disaster of the nuclear industry, yes.
   c0011-new-01.jpg

   The disaster was sparked by massive explosions that tore the roof off
   of Chernobyl's reactor number four, spewing radioactive dust into the
   atmosphere.

   The Soviets drafted over half a million troops to put out the fire and
   clear the nuclear debris. Thousands got seriously ill from radiation
   exposure. Today, three decades later, the cleanup continues.

   But as this recent video shows, the reactor is still packed with
   poison: heaps of gnarled steel and concrete, pools of nuclear fuel that
   have hardened into a dense mass called the "elephant's foot."

   There's still so much radiation coming from the reactor that workers
   have to construct the arch nearly a thousand feet away, shielded by a
   massive concrete wall. When finished, the arch will be slid into place
   around the Sarcophagus, then sealed up.

   Nicolas Caille: We will push it in once, the average speed it will be
   around 10 meters an hour. So it's approximately the speed of a snail.

   Bob Simon: Right. But that's pretty rapid considering the size of this
   thing.

   Nicolas Caille: It is. Yes, yes.

   But the construction itself will have to move a lot quicker. The old
   plant and sarcophagus are falling apart. Just two years ago, a snow
   storm caused the roof of one of the buildings to collapse, forcing
   workers to be evacuated and raising fears of further contamination.

"This was a terrifying picture. It looked like a sunset in the distance,
about 100, 200 yards from you."

   Radiation is not subject to the usual rules of life and death. It is
   virtually eternal. When Caille took us on a tour of the site, we were
   fitted with dosimeters to tell us how much we were being exposed to.
   Suddenly, a sound we didn't want to hear.

   Bob Simon: Hey, there's beepers going off.

   Nicolas Caille: No, no. It's not. It's normal.

   Bob Simon: You're sure?

   Nicolas Caille: Yes, yes, yes. I'm definitively sure.

   Bob Simon: I don't like a beeper in Chernobyl. I don't like that sound.

   Chernobyl’s "invisible" danger

   Building the arch under these conditions is challenging enough. But
   some of the biggest obstacles have nothing to do with radiation. As
   violence gripped Ukraine this year, one of the arch's contractors
   backed out. The project is also 770 million dollars short, and it has
   been plagued by repeated delays.

   No matter when it's completed, vast stretches of the Zone will never
   recover. This is the city of Pripyat, two miles from the reactor.
   Thirty years ago, the population was 50,000. Today it is zero. Pripyat
   was where many of the plant's workers lived, grateful for their posting
   in a town that was the model of Soviet modernity.

   Nine-story apartment buildings lined this boulevard. They're still
   there, but you can't see them anymore. The forest has taken over. A
   vision perhaps of what the whole world might look like were people to
   just disappear.

   It was springtime in Pripyat that day in 1986, and an amusement park
   was due to open in a few days. Andre Glukhov lived here then.
   a014c028130109jj-new-01.jpg

   Bob Simon: So, that Ferris wheel never had any kids in it?

   Andrey Glukhov: Never had any kids. These bumper cars, on your left,
   had never kids on it, too.

   Bob Simon: When you talk to your former neighbors, what do you call it?
   The accident? the catastrophe?

   Andrey Glukhov: We just call it 26, which was the date of the accident.

   Bob Simon: Twenty-six?

   Andrey Glukhov: Twenty-sixth of April.

   Bob Simon: Sort of like the Americans call 9/11?

   Andrey Glukhov: Exactly.

   Back then, Glukhov worked for Chernobyl's nuclear safety division. He
   took us on a tour through a part of the plant that had not been
   destroyed. He was off duty that night, but what he saw when he drove
   past the damaged reactor was like nothing he, or anyone else, had ever
   seen.

   [Andrey Glukhov: This is the control room...]

   Andrey Glukhov: This was a terrifying picture. It looked like a sunset
   in the distance, about 100, 200 yards from you. And this was the
   glowing core of the reactor.

   Bob Simon: That was the first and the only time you saw it?

   Andrey Glukhov: No, that was the first time when I realized the scale
   of the disaster.

   Glukhov told his family in Pripyat to stay inside and close the
   windows. Soviet authorities covered the area with secrecy, told people
   they had nothing to worry about. But 36 hours later, over a thousand
   busses were sent in to evacuate everyone. Authorities told people it
   would only be for three days -- one of many lies. The people never came
   back, and Pripyat is being overwhelmed by the elements. One of the only
   things still recognizable is that old Soviet iconography.

   Radiation at Chernobyl is "a global problem"

   Drive through the Zone, and you'll find that many villages suffered the
   same fate as Pripyat. A row of simple markers has been planted with the
   names of each one.

   But amidst this wilderness, the strangest sight of all. People, just a
   few. Ivan Ivanovitch and his wife Maria were evacuated to an apartment
   block near Kiev after the accident, but couldn't take it. They weren't
   made for the city, so two years later, they came back. Today, there are
   three other people living in this village... just a few miles from the
   old power plant.

"There certainly is evidence that some of the genetic damage that occurs at
the level of the DNA can be transmitted from one generation to the next."

   Bob Simon: When you decided to come back to live here, did anyone tell
   you it was dangerous?

   Ivan Ivanovitch: It's really OK here. You know, when I lived in that
   apartment block, I got sick all the time. But when I came back here, I
   was fine. And I've been fine ever since.

   Bob Simon: You should never leave home.

   Ivan Ivanovitch: I would be long gone if I'd stayed there. I'd be in
   the ground.

   Despite the danger, Tim Mousseau also chose to be here. For the last 15
   years, the University of South Carolina biologist has been studying the
   contamination's impact from a makeshift lab inside the Zone.
   aa055701-new-02.jpg

   Bob Simon: Aren't many serious labs I've seen that look like this.

   Tim Mousseau: Yeah this is an opportunistic lab. It's an old villager's
   house.

   Mousseau's research has shown that the catastrophe continues to take
   its toll.

   Tim Mousseau: And we're going to attempt to measure just how
   radioactive these mice are.

   Bob Simon: What's the comparison between the amounts of radiation a
   mouse would have here and a mouse somewhere else?

   Tim Mousseau: Some of these mice have on the order of 10,000 times more
   radioactivity in their bodies than in clean areas.

   The human toll has been profound as well. Thyroid cancer and leukemia
   affected thousands -- though the exact number of deaths is still being
   debated.

   Tim Mousseau: There certainly is evidence that some of the genetic
   damage that occurs at the level of the DNA can be transmitted from one
   generation to the next.

   Bob Simon: So a nuclear disaster is never over?

   Tim Mousseau: There will be areas that will be contaminated for
   thousands, if not millions, of years.

   This makes the Zone like no other place on Earth, which is why it's
   attracting tourists. If you've done Paris and Rome, why not try a
   holiday in hell. Check out the apocalypse?
   Tourists in Chernobyl.jpg

   Bob Simon: How did your friends react when you told them you were
   coming on vacation to Chernobyl?

   David McHale: They thought it was very strange, you know. But, I mean,
   people have been coming here for a while, so you know, I guess it must
   be safe.

   Bob Simon: You guess it must be safe. What makes you believe it's safe?

   David McHale: Well, you know, I would assume that the guides wouldn't
   bring people here if it wasn't safe.

   Bob Simon: All right, well, I hope you're right.

   David McHale: So do I.

   Thousands of workers flood into the Zone every day, to look after what
   remains of the plant. Others live here year-round, in one of the few
   places safe enough for inhabitants: the town of Chernobyl itself.

   Yevgen Goncharenko was our guide. He lives here too.

   Bob Simon: Why are you living here and not in Kiev?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: Because I like this place. For me and it's very
   interesting maybe even sacred place for me.

   Bob Simon: A sacred place?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: For me, yeah.

   He spends much of his time writing music on his bass guitar. Music as
   desolate as the landscape surrounding him. As desolate as the remains
   of this empire that has long since disappeared.

   A decade after the disaster, workers here built a monument honoring
   their colleagues whose lives had been destroyed.
   aa070601-new-01.jpg

   Bob Simon: The workers and the firemen made the monument themselves?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

   Bob Simon: And what does it say?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: "To those who saved the world."

   Bob Simon: "To those who saved the world."

   That may sound a bit hyperbolic. But when the reactor exploded in 1986,
   radioactive dust and debris were carried as far away as Italy and
   Sweden. Until the arch finally seals up that stricken reactor, and no
   one knows when that might be, something like that could happen again.
   Unlike other historic relics, Chernobyl does not belong to the past;
   its power will never die. Chernobyl is forever.

Maguire: Whistleblower was "not ignored"

   In his opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee,
   Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire said a
   whistleblower complaint about President Trump's call to Ukraine's
   president was "not ignored" by intelligence officials. Watch his full
   opening statement.

Why Trump's Ukraine call is "unprecedented"

   Lawmakers will question Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph
   Maguire Thursday about a whistleblower complaint that led to a House
   impeachment inquiry. When that report first crossed Maguire’s desk, he
   would not let Congress see it. The whistleblower is an intelligence
   official who learned about President Trump’s call with the Ukraine
   president "secondhand" from "White House officials" and believed that
   Mr. Trump's request for dirt on Joe Biden amounted to "soliciting a
   foreign campaign contribution in violation of the campaign finance
   laws." CBS News senior national security analyst Michael Morell joins
   “CBS This Morning” to discuss why Mr. Trump's call with the foreign
   leader is "unprecedented."

How Starbucks covers pricey in vitro fertilization for even its part-time
employees

     *
     *
     *

   September 5, 2017 / 7:47 AM / CBS News

   For some couples, finding a job that offers benefits to cover
   infertility could be the difference between having kids and not. One in
   eight couples in the United States has trouble getting pregnant and the
   cost of fertility treatments is not cheap.

   You might expect a tech company or big bank to offer coverage for
   treatments like in vitro fertilization, but Starbucks also offers the
   perk – even for part-time baristas.

   Now, some women are taking jobs there, in hopes that becoming a barista
   will get them a baby, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.
   Shannon Iagulli CBS News

   "It was the darkest time of my life. Our marriage really took a hit,"
   said Shannon Iagulli.

   Iagulli and her husband Nic desperately wanted children. But four years
   into their marriage, it seemed Shannon couldn't get pregnant.

   "You go through your life hearing you grow up, you fall in love, you
   get married, you have kids so it doesn't happen, you don't understand.
   Why is my body not doing it," Shannon said. "And that's where Starbucks
   came in."

   Iagulli learned the company offered an unusual benefit: coverage for in
   vitro fertilization. On average, IVF costs $20,000 per cycle, with most
   couples going through two to three rounds before getting pregnant.
   Starbucks executive Lucy Helm CBS News

   "I mean, you think barista, you think 18-year-old working to go through
   school, not a 27-year-old woman trying to have a baby," Iagulli said.

   Starbucks covers $20,000 for IVF and related medication for all
   eligible employees. That includes part-time baristas who make, on
   average, about $10,000 per year.

   "It's just been part of who we are, that if you work here and you put
   in the time, you're going to get the benefits that make you a full
   partner," said Starbucks executive Lucy Helm. "It is really important
   to everyone and I think it's something that we're all very, very proud
   of. People fall in love with working for our company once they become a
   partner here."

   But business professor Craig Garthwaite, with Northwestern University's
   Kellogg school of Management, says it's not just about making employees
   happy.

   "In the end, Starbucks is a for-profit, publicly traded company.
   They're not doing this out of the goodness of their heart, this is part
   of a cohesive strategy they have for how to attract and retain talent
   and also to advertise to their customers that they are quote unquote 'a
   good company', one that you want to spend a certain amount of money
   buying coffee at when you could get that coffee potentially cheaper
   somewhere else," Garthwaite said.

   Asked if there was a business case for wanting to keep the same people
   other than just being a nice place to work, Helm said, "Absolutely, no
   question that in today's retail world in which fewer people are out and
   about shopping, places have to be a destination. So yeah, of course
   it's a business case for bringing in more customers because they
   increasingly have that connection with who we are and who serves them."

   Not everyone is happy with the company's wages and benefits: thousands
   have signed a petition online started by a barista complaining about
   understaffing and low morale.
   CBS News

   But count Shannon Iagulli among the happiest of Starbucks baristas. IVF
   gave the Iagullis not one baby, but two, who at six weeks old, made
   their first visit to a Starbucks, their mom's workplace.

   What she's going to tell her kids about Starbucks when they're older?

   "They will know that that's how they came about that if it wasn't for
   mommy going to make coffee that they wouldn't be here," Iagulli said.

   Now, she supports other hopeful barista-moms around the country.
   They've even got a Facebook group called -- what else -- Starbucks IVF
   Mommas.

   Starbucks says it doesn't know how many women are doing this.

   For the Iagullis, after insurance, they only ended up paying about
   $2,300 out of pocket.

   After getting pregnant last year, Iagulli left Starbucks for another
   job. Now she says, come this fall, when the twins are a little older,
   she'd like to go back. They need the health benefits for the family,
   plus she and her husband want to have more kids.
