   ShakeOut began in California and has also been organized in many other
   states and countries. Official ShakeOut Regions require significant
   local or regional coordination, typically by an emergency management
   agency or an alliance of many organizations. If you are interested in
   establishing ShakeOut for your region please contact us. If your state,
   province, or country is not yet participating you can register yourself
   or your organization as part of the global participation total.
