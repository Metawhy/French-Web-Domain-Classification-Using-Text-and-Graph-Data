India seeks collaborators for a mission to Venus, the neglected planet

   By Pallava BaglaNov. 21, 2018 , 3:30 PM

   NEW DELHI—The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in Bengaluru
   will send an orbiter to Venus in 2023 and has invited scientists from
   around the world to submit proposals for instruments to carry along.
   The plan, which will include a balloon dropped into the planet’s
   atmosphere, has received a warm welcome from Venus scientists, many of
   whom feel that, compared with the moon and Mars, their planet has
   received short shrift in the past 2 decades.

   The as-yet-unnamed spacecraft is likely to weigh 2500 kilograms and may
   have a 100-kilogram payload; it will be launched on India’s heaviest
   rocket, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III. The
   orbiter will initially be placed in a large elliptical orbit around
   Venus that is gradually shrunk.

   Like Earth, Venus is some 4.5 billion years old; the planets are of
   similar size and mass. But Venus has witnessed a runaway greenhouse
   phenomenon, leading to a dense, carbon dioxide–rich atmosphere that may
   offer scientists clues about the development of Earth’s atmosphere.
   “Planetary comparative climatology is an area of continued interest and
   research. The opportunity to explore Venus together is welcome,” says
   Lori Glaze, acting head of NASA’s planetary science division in
   Washington, D.C.

   Venus is a hostile planet to study: Its thick clouds make research from
   an orbiter difficult, while heat, high pressure, and sulfuric acid
   droplets make descending to the surface a technological nightmare. Of
   the more than 40 Venus missions so far, roughly half have failed, and
   only a handful spacecraft have touched down on the planet’s surface.

   That’s why the crowd gathered at a meeting of NASA’s Venus Exploration
   Analysis Group in Laurel, Maryland, was “very excited” to hear India’s
   call for collaboration on 6 November, says Patrick McGovern of the
   Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. “In the absence of new
   Venus missions and data, it is increasingly difficult to generate
   support for students and early-career researchers interested in Venus,”
   he says. That keeps the Venus community small, which “in turn affects
   the ability to rally support for new missions,” McGovern says. “In my
   view we are presently at the reconnaissance stage of [Venus]
   exploration, equivalent to that of pre-1997 Mars.”

   “Planetary exploration should be all about global partnerships,” says
   Indian Space Research Organisation chair Kailasavadivoo Sivan.

   ISRO has already selected 12 instruments, proposed by Indian
   scientists, including cameras and chemical analyzers to study the
   atmosphere. Now, it’s hoping other scientists will join. “Planetary
   exploration should be all about global partnerships,” says
   Kailasavadivoo Sivan, a rocket scientist and ISRO’s chair. (The
   deadline for submitting proposals is 20 December.)

   McGovern hopes to send a radar instrument that could penetrate the
   thick clouds and make sharper maps of the surface, which could help
   address questions remaining after NASA’s 1989 Magellan mission to
   Venus. Planetary scientist Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado
   in Boulder says he’d like to contribute instruments that would study
   the planet’s atmosphere. He’s particularly interested in Venus’s clouds
   and how they could be responding to possible ongoing volcanic
   eruptions. “The past ISRO missions provide confidence,” Esposito says.
   (India visited the moon in 2008 and Mars in 2014; it has another moon
   mission scheduled next year and a new visit to Mars in 2022.)

   Astrophysicist Jacques Blamont, a former head of France’s National
   Center for Space Studies in Paris, several years ago proposed producing
   metallic balloons that could dip in and out of Venus’s hot atmosphere
   to study its chemistry. ISRO has adopted that idea, says Sivan, but
   will develop the balloon in-house. It will carry 10 kilograms of
   instruments and float down to 55 kilometers above the surface.

India seeks collaborators for a mission to Venus, the neglected planet

   By Pallava BaglaNov. 21, 2018 , 3:30 PM

   NEW DELHI—The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in Bengaluru
   will send an orbiter to Venus in 2023 and has invited scientists from
   around the world to submit proposals for instruments to carry along.
   The plan, which will include a balloon dropped into the planet’s
   atmosphere, has received a warm welcome from Venus scientists, many of
   whom feel that, compared with the moon and Mars, their planet has
   received short shrift in the past 2 decades.

   The as-yet-unnamed spacecraft is likely to weigh 2500 kilograms and may
   have a 100-kilogram payload; it will be launched on India’s heaviest
   rocket, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III. The
   orbiter will initially be placed in a large elliptical orbit around
   Venus that is gradually shrunk.

   Like Earth, Venus is some 4.5 billion years old; the planets are of
   similar size and mass. But Venus has witnessed a runaway greenhouse
   phenomenon, leading to a dense, carbon dioxide–rich atmosphere that may
   offer scientists clues about the development of Earth’s atmosphere.
   “Planetary comparative climatology is an area of continued interest and
   research. The opportunity to explore Venus together is welcome,” says
   Lori Glaze, acting head of NASA’s planetary science division in
   Washington, D.C.

   Venus is a hostile planet to study: Its thick clouds make research from
   an orbiter difficult, while heat, high pressure, and sulfuric acid
   droplets make descending to the surface a technological nightmare. Of
   the more than 40 Venus missions so far, roughly half have failed, and
   only a handful spacecraft have touched down on the planet’s surface.

   That’s why the crowd gathered at a meeting of NASA’s Venus Exploration
   Analysis Group in Laurel, Maryland, was “very excited” to hear India’s
   call for collaboration on 6 November, says Patrick McGovern of the
   Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. “In the absence of new

   exploration should be all about global partnerships,” says
   Kailasavadivoo Sivan, a rocket scientist and ISRO’s chair. (The
   deadline for submitting proposals is 20 December.)

   McGovern hopes to send a radar instrument that could penetrate the
   thick clouds and make sharper maps of the surface, which could help
   address questions remaining after NASA’s 1989 Magellan mission to
   Venus. Planetary scientist Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado
   in Boulder says he’d like to contribute instruments that would study
   the planet’s atmosphere. He’s particularly interested in Venus’s clouds
   and how they could be responding to possible ongoing volcanic
   eruptions. “The past ISRO missions provide confidence,” Esposito says.
   (India visited the moon in 2008 and Mars in 2014; it has another moon
   mission scheduled next year and a new visit to Mars in 2022.)

   Astrophysicist Jacques Blamont, a former head of France’s National
   Center for Space Studies in Paris, several years ago proposed producing
   metallic balloons that could dip in and out of Venus’s hot atmosphere
   to study its chemistry. ISRO has adopted that idea, says Sivan, but
   will develop the balloon in-house. It will carry 10 kilograms of
   instruments and float down to 55 kilometers above the surface.
