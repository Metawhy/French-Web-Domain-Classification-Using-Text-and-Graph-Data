What is the Chief Executives Board for Coordination?

   The CEB brings together the executive heads of 31 specialized
   organizations to deliver as one at the global, regional and country
   levels. It is supported by two pillars:
     * High Level Committee on Programmes (HLCP)
     * High Level Committee on Management (HLCM)

   It is the prime instrument for strengthening the coordination role of
   UN inter-governmental bodies on social, economic and related matters.

   levels. It is supported by two pillars:
