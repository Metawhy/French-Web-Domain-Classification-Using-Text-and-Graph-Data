Matomo Media Pack

   For media, press or anyone interested in helping promote Matomo, here’s
   a little something to get you started. Below is the Matomo media pack
   containing resources you might find handy for your articles/blogs. For
   interviews or quotes, please email marketing@matomo.org.

Description: About Matomo in less than 200 words

   Matomo is the leading open-source web analytics platform, used on over
   1.4 million websites in over 190 countries and translated into over 50
   languages. Matomo values privacy protection, 100% data ownership and no
   data sampling.

   It has two different hosting options – cloud and on-premise. Cloud
   takes the hassle out of installation, whereas On-Premise is the free,
   open-source and self-hosted PHP/MySQL software you can install on your
   own server, which gives you maximum flexibility.

   This premium web analytics and conversion optimisation tool is designed
   to give you the most conclusive insights with a complete range of
   features such as heatmaps, sessions recordings, goals, form analytics,
   visitor profiles, ecommerce and funnels.

   It provides real time updates on the details of your visitors; has goal
   conversion tracking to track business objectives; event tracking to
   identify and measure the interaction of the user with your website; and
   A/B testing which helps you optimise your website through learning
   which content truly resonates with your audience.

   Visit matomo.org for more information.

Users Flow

Table of contents

    1. Viewing the Users Flow visualization
    2. Viewing the most popular paths and visitor engagement
    3. Applying segments

   With Users Flow, you find out which paths your visitors or users take
   in your website or app. Find out if your call to actions really work,
   find bugs, find the parts of your website or app where your users get
   confused, understand your visitors path to conversion or purchase,
   discover high drop-offs on pages and more. Based on this information
   you can improve your website or app to increase your conversions and
   sales.

   Users Flow is a premium feature which is included in all our
   Cloud-hosted plans or you can purchase it on the Matomo Marketplace if
   you self host Matomo On-Premise. Learn more about all the benefits and
   features of Users Flow.

Viewing the Users Flow visualization

   Go to Matomo (Piwik). In the menu click “Visitors” and then “Users
   Flow”. You will see a visualization of the most popular pages and the
   paths your users took over several steps.

   Users Flow Visualization Users Flow Visualization

   In the top left you can adjust the report to show more or less details
   and to change the number of actions per interaction step.

   Users Flow Controls Users Flow Controls

   The visualization lets you dig into the data in many different ways.
   You can see tabular list of all interactions by clicking on an
   “Interaction” title or by clicking on a green node and then selecting
   “Show details”. This way you can also find out which pages were grouped
   together under “Others”. If you are interested in how your users came
   to a particular page at a particular step and where they went to next,
   click on a green node and then select “Explore traffic”. This will show
   you for example the flow for all visitors or users that have visited a
   page “/start” at interaction step 2.

   Users Flow Interaction Menu Users Flow Interaction Menu

   You can add this visualization to your dashboard and export the view to
   share it with your colleagues or clients. The data is also accessible
   on the Matomo Mobile app.

Viewing the most popular paths and visitor engagement

   To analyze more Users Flow reports click in the menu on “Actions” and
   then “Top Paths”. In a glance you will see which paths your users take
   most often.

   Users Flow Top Paths Users Flow Top Paths

   The “Overview” lets you investigate the visitor engagement, for example
   after how many interactions your visitors drop off. When you click on a
   row, you can see which pages they visited most often at a particular
   interaction step, and where they went to from there. The data in this
   overview report table is the same as the data displayed in the Users
   Flow visualization but there are times where it is more helpful to
   explore it in a tabular way.

   Users Flow Overview Users Flow Overview

Applying segments

   The Users Flow gets even more valuable when you apply segments. Learn
   for example how your visitors navigate through your website when they
   enter it for the first time by applying the segment “Visit type is
   new”. Learn how your visitors browsed through your website that have
   converted a goal by applying the segment “Visit converted a specific
   goal”. Or maybe you want to analyze and compare how the paths vary
   depending on a different country or referrer? You can apply any Matomo
   segment to the Users Flow reports.

   Learn more in the Users Flow marketplace page.

How to measure the performance of a newsletter (or any email) with Matomo

     * December 19, 2017

   To be able to grow your business, it is crucial to track all your
   marketing efforts. This includes all newsletters and emails that you
   share with people outside of your business. Otherwise, you won’t be
   able to know which of your daily efforts are yielding results.

   Are you wondering if it is possible to track the performance of an
   emailing campaign in Matomo (Piwik) efficiently? Would you like to know
   if it is technically easy? No worries, here is a “How to” tutorial
   showing you how easily you can track an emailing in Matomo properly.

Different tracking levels for different needs

   There are many things that you may be interested to track, for example:

   [svg%3E] [newsletter_email_campaign1.jpg]
    1. How many users opened your email
    2. How many users interacted with the links in your email
    3. How many users interacted on your website through your email

   Let’s have a look at each of these levels.

Step 1 – Tracking email and newsletter openings in Matomo

   Tracking email openings requires to add an HTML code to your
   newsletter. It works through what we call a tracking pixel, a tiny
   image of 1×1 that is transparent so the user will not be able to see
   it.
   In order to install it, here is an example of what this code looks
   like:
<img src="https://piwik.example.com/piwik.php?idsite=YOUR_PIWIK_WEBSITE_ID&rec=1
&bots=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Femail-opened%2Fnewsletter_XYZ&action_nam
e=Email%20opened&_rcn=internal%20email%20name&_rck=newsletter_XYZ" style="border
:0;” alt="" />

The Matomo tracking pixel explained

   The above URL is composed of the following URL parameters which are
   part of our Tracking API:
     * idsite: Corresponds to the ID of the website you would like to
       track.
     * rec: You need to have rec=1 in order for the request to be actually
       recorded.
     * bots: Set it to 1 to include all the connections made to this
       request, bots included.
     * url: corresponds to the URL you would like to display in Matomo
       every time the email is opened.
     * action_name: This is the page name you would like to be tracked
       when the email is opened.
     * _rcn: The name you would like to give to your campaign.
     * _rck: The keyword you may like to use in order to summarize the
       content of your newsletter.

   You may have noticed some special characters here such as “%20”, “%2F”.
   That’s because the URL is encoded. We strongly recommend you to do so
   in order for your tracking not to break. Many tools are available on
   the web in order to encode your URLs such as
   https://www.urlencoder.org/.

   If you would like to access the previous tracking code easily, keep in
   mind that you can always find the tracking code generator within the
   “Matomo admin panel → Tracking code”:

   You can find more information about it on our guide at: How do I track
   how many users open and read my newsletter emails (using a pixel /
   beacon)?

   As a result, the information will be pushed as following for any user
   who opens your email:

   [svg%3E] [newsletter_email_campaign4.png]

   To not bias your regular page views on your website with newsletter
   openings, we recommend tracking newsletter openings into a new website.

Tracking even more data: the user ID example

   You can go deeper in your URL tracking by inserting other parameters
   such as the user id if you have this information within your emailing
   database. One of the main benefit of tracking the User ID is to connect
   data across multiple devices and browsers for a given user.

   You only need to add the following parameter &uid=XXX where XXX equals
   the dynamic value of the user ID:

   [svg%3E] [newsletter_email_campaign2.png]

   Make sure that UID from your emailing provider is the same as the one
   used on your website in order for your data to be consistent.

   Important note: some email providers are loading email messages by
   default which results in an opening even if the user did not actually
   open the email.

Step 2 – Measure the clicks within your emailing

   Tracking clicks within an email lets you know with which content
   readers interacted the most. We recommend tracking all links in all
   your emails as a campaign, whether it is a newsletter, a custom support
   email, an email invoice, etc. You might be surprised to see which of
   your emails lead to conversions and if they don’t, try to tweak those
   emails, so they might in the future.

   Tracking clicks This works thanks to URL campaign tracking. In order to
   perform this action, you will need to add Matomo URL parameters to all
   your existing link URLs:
     * Website URL: for example “www.your-website.com”.
     * Campaign name: for example “pk_campaign=emailing”. Represents the
       name you would like to give to your campaign.
     * Campaign keyword: for example “pk_keyword=name-of-your-article”.
       Represents the name you would like to give to your content.
     * Campaign source: for example “pk_source=newsletter”. Represents the
       name of the referrer.
     * Campaign medium: for example “pk_medium=email”. Represents the type
       of referrer you are using.
     * Campaign content: for example “pk_content=title”. Represents the
       type of content.

   You can find more information about campaign url tracking in our
   “Tracking marketing campaigns with Matomo” guide.

   Here is a sample showing you how you can differentiate some links in a
   newsletter, all pointing to the same URL:

   [svg%3E] [newsletter_email_campaign5.png]

   Once you have added these URL parameters to each of your link, Matomo
   will clearly indicate the referrer of this specific campaign when a
   user clicks on a link in the newsletter and visits your website.

   Important note: if you do not track your campaigns, it will result in a
   bad interpretation of your data within Matomo as you will get webmail
   services or direct entries as referrer instead of your newsletter
   campaign.

Step 3 – Measure emailing performances on your website

   Thanks to Matomo URL campaign parameters, you can now clearly identify
   the traffic brought through your emailing. You can now specifically
   isolate users who come from emails by creating a segment:

   [svg%3E] [newsletter_campaign_segment.png]

   Once done, you can either have a look at each user specifically through
   the visitor log report or analyze it as a whole within the rest of the
   reports.

   You can even measure your return on investment directly if goals have
   been defined. In order to know more about how to track goals within
   Matomo.
