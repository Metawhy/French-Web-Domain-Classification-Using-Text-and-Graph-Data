Become an Ambassador

Do you love nature?

Are you the kind of person who loves to motivate people to get outside?

Do you want to have impact on your community?

Are you hoping to make new friends as you enter into this transition in life
of parenting a little one?

Are you looking for a community to help get you out on those days when it's
hard to adventure?

Parenthood is an adventure and we want to share that experience with you!

Keeping reading below to learn more about benefits and responsibility of
being a Hike it Baby Branch Ambassador.


   Our community is built on dedicated volunteers who all have a common
   goal—to get children out into nature from birth to school age. Whether
   you are an experienced outdoors person or just getting started at
   hiking, becoming a Hike it Baby Ambassador in your community is an
   amazing way to build a strong outdoors foundation for your whole
   family.

   As a local Ambassador, you are a role model in a growing organization
   that builds positive, supportive social groups to help get the whole
   family outside. You set the tone of the community branch and how others
   perceive Hike it Baby in the community, which is a very rewarding,
   positive experience. The more you put in, the more you get out, however
   we always try to be flexible and let you scale your participation as it
   fits your life. Hike it Baby has a Mentor program and each branch is
   given access to this program to act as a resource as needed.

   What's a branch?
   Hike it Baby branches are sort of like clubs. These are the limbs on
   our strong tree that spans nationwide. Branches can be either based on
   a city or a county depending on the density of the population. Each
   Branch has a Facebook page and hikes are submitted by ambassadors and
   the community and appear on a national calendar that helps encourage
   others to get outside.

   As a Hike it Baby Branch Ambassador, your main responsibility is to
   help your community get excited to hike all year round. This means
   answering questions about how to host hikes, making people feel welcome
   on the Facebook page, hosting hikes in your area so others can learn
   how to be good Hike Hosts for Hike it Baby. Host events that work for
   your family with the core mission in mind: getting children and
   families outside and in nature.

   Branch Ambassadors go through an online training program that
   explains responsibilities and requirements in more depth as well as
   additional suggestions to do as a Branch Ambassador (not mandatory but
   helpful).

   What does "hike" mean?
   We use the terms “hike” and “baby” in Hike it Baby very loosely. Hike
   can mean anything from a dirt path up a mountain, a trail through the
   woods, gathering to play at a city or neighborhood park, an urban
   stroll to grab some coffee, or seasonal indoor events. And baby refers
   to any child, no matter their age. We welcome anyone to join our team
   of Branch Ambassadors no matter what age their child is or how many
   “trails” there are in their community.

   Branch Ambassador Responsibilities
     * Moderate your Branch’s Facebook group
     * Pass along information like great articles, fun downloadables and
       outdoor tips from our national communication to your local
       community
     * Get one hike a week in the calendar (as a branch, not necessarily
       you personally)
     * Participate in community outreach to grow your branch (online and
       in person)
     * Encourage members to find new trails and support them in getting
       those shared with the community through our trail guide.
     * Help write up information about great family-friendly trails in
       your area

   Branch Ambassador Benefits
     * Become a member of a tight, supportive community of parents that
       stretches from your local branch, across the US
     * Become a member of a private support group on Facebook to share
       stories, receive advice, and support each other in getting out
       there during those hard months
     * Receive special discounts on Hike it Baby t-shirts and learn about
       special discounts on other outdoor gear through professional
       outdoor industry websites
     * Annual print subscription to Backpacker magazine
     * Discount on Deuter backpacks and frame carriers
     * Hike it Baby volunteer sticker to show your love to the world on
       your car window or bumper
     * Excellent reference for future jobs and volunteer positions you
       seek out in the world

   Branch Ambassador Requirements
     * Internet access so you are able to perform the above
       responsibilities
     * Check your email on a regular basis – we send a weekly Branch Team
       Newsletter
     * Online training to learn about policy and procedure to help
       with facilitating community development

   Time Commitment
   Expect to spend about 8-12 hours per month on Branch Ambassador
   responsibilities, which includes regular check-ins on Facebook and
   reading newsletter updates. You don't have to be on Facebook to be a
   Branch Ambassador. These responsibilities are able to be divvied up
   among teammates. If you have any additional questions on what to expect
   as a Branch Ambassador, please email training@hikeitbaby.com.

   Training

   The training program is a go at your own pace program. We understand
   that everyone learns at a different pace. Go through training at a pace
   that fits your life. The first course within the training program is
   the Pre-requisites course. This course will go through all the
   necessary “paperwork” within the Hike it Baby Program. Once you finish
   the Pre-requisite course you will be prompted to either join the "New
   Branch Trail" Program or the "Co-Ambassador Trail" Program.

   New Branch Trail Training - This program is for ambassadors that are
   starting a new branch and have no existing ambassadors assigned to
   their desired geographical area. This program focuses on founding a
   branch from the beginning. You will build your community and work to
   build your branch.

   Co-Branch Trail Program- This program is for ambassadors that are
   joining an existing branch and they have a ambassador already assigned
   to their branch area. This program is focused on team work and
   incorporating yourself into a cohesive team.

   Not Sure what program you should join? Follow this link. If your city
   is present follow the Facebook Link provided, Join your branches
   Facebook Group and contact the current ambassadors and let them know
   you will be joining their team.

   If you don’t see your city or a city located near (30 miles of less)
   you, New branch training is where you need to be.

   Getting to Know Hike it Baby Nationally
   We encourage you to join your neighbor branches on Facebook to get to
   know the kinds of events others are hosting and become familiar with
   Hike it Baby in your region. Before you begin training, potential
   Branch Ambassadors should also join 2-3 other branches across the
   country to get an idea of what the workload is involved of various
   branch sizes.

   Fees
   There is a $50 non-refundable administrative fee for every Branch
   Ambassador. The fee covers our administration costs for our training
   and support program as well as our website costs. The new Branch
   Ambassador Membership can be found
   here: https://hikeitbaby.com/product/branch-ambassador-fee/

   After your first year as an Ambassador, we ask that you renew your
   annual membership by selecting the donation level that best works for
   your family. We respect that not everyone can cover these costs,
   therefore we have created a sliding scale for the Annual Ambassador
   Membership Renewal.

   If you have questions or would like more information, please let us
   know! Our New Branch Team can be reached at training@hikeitbaby.com.

   IS THERE AN EXISTING BRANCH NEAR YOU?

   There are two places to check to find out if a community exists
   already:
   Find hikes in your area with our hike search to connect with a branch
   in the real world.
   Find your local Facebook page to connect with your community online.

Here is how to get Started: follow this link to our Ambassador Only Training
and Support Webpage!
