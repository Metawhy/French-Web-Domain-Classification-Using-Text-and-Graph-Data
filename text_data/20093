A Quick Freebie Google Drawings Graphic Organizer

   6:27 AM
   I am currently taking the Classy Graphics class from Learning In Hand
   with Tony Vincent to pick up some fun tips and pointers about designing
   graphics and learning activities in G Suite apps like Google Drawings,
   Slides, and more.
   [Classy%252BGraphics%252BWinter%252B2019%252BHeader.001.jpeg]
   Our first week assignment was to create a graphic organizer in Google
   Drawings.  The second graders at my school are beginning research on
   our Moon, so I thought it would be fun to make a little graphic
   organizer for them to use.
   [Jessica%2BCarlton%2B-%2BThe%2BMoon%2Bweb%2Bdiagram.png]
   Each of the white boxes is a text box.  Students can type the facts
   they find in the boxes.  I would also encourage them to type the name
   of the resource or website where they found there fact.
   Get your copy of this graphic organizer by clicking here then clicking
   the Use Template button.
   Enjoy!

Better Than Brag Tags...Swag Tags!!!

   4:53 PM
   [pub?w=576&amp;h=576]
   I have told you a little about my Professional Development badging
   program...but students can benefit from a similar type program too!  I
   found out about an amazing line of Swag Tags from Boost Promotions that
   would help you accomplish an amazing student badging program in your
   classroom.
   First, you may wonder why Boost Promotions' Swag Tags?  These swag tags
   are super durable!  They seem like they are made of plastic but more
   likely a laminated cardstock.  They come in a variety of sizes and
   shapes including ovals, guitar pics, circles, shields, pencils, and
   more!
   [IMG_2895.JPG]
   Boost Promotions' Swag Tags also have an almost overwhelming selection
   of designs in their Design Library.  Boost Promotions's Design Teams
   have created Swag Tags for academics,
    arts, attendance, behavior, birthdays, clubs, holidays, collectibles,
   and other awards.  If you are like me, you can even modify their
   designs or create your own.
   To start out, I suggest giving one of the Teacher Kit Swag Tags a try.
    You can choose 10 packs of designs.  There were so many cute designs I
   had a difficult time deciding on just 10...
   [rsz_img_2896.png]
   You also can get them customized with your name or your school's name.
   While I suggest Boost Promotions' Swag Tags for badging, you can also
   use them for other incentive or reward programs.  Some schools even
   sell them as a fundraiser!  They can fit so many needs...they are worth
   the look!

PD Badging - Part 2: The Badges

   3:43 PM
   [pub?w=720&amp;h=720]
   So in my last post, I introduced you to the PD Badging program I
   created for my school called the B.E.S. Tech Challenge.  Now you are
   probably thinking what exactly must be done to earn a badge?  Or the
   more popular question I receive, where do you get these cute badges
   from?  Let me start by answering these questions, and more....

How do you choose what tools or topics you create badges for?

   I have a couple different ways I choose what tools or topics I will
   offer badges for.
    1. My school district has a set of evidence-based pedagogical
       strategies supported by the district for use in every
       classroom called the Quality-Plus Teaching Strategies. Each
       strategy has tools that help support the use of these strategies.
       I want teachers at my school to have the knowledge of how to use
       these tools in their bag of tricks, so those are included (or being
       worked on being included) in my PD Badging program.
    2. I take the recommendations of ed tech tools and topics from other
       technology coordinators and coaches as well as those I have
       collaborated with on the work for this PD Badge program.
    3. I also take the recommendations and suggestions for badges from the
       teachers at my school.  I love hearing what tools and topics they
       about which they have heard and would like to learn more.

What must be done to earn a badge?

   To earn a badge, learning as well as evidence of that learning must be
   completed.  Learning through videos and other websites are available
   through the badging website.  While record my own screencasts as well,
   I rely on videos posted on YouTube as well as tutorials posted by
   others on websites and other bloggers.  I am also available to teachers
   to help them through their learning.
   [Animoto%2BBadge%2BLevel%2B1.png] Once the learning is complete,
   evidence of that learning needs to be submitted. Evidence is usually
   creating something using that tool by the teacher or the student.  Or
   evidence could be a score report from using a tool in a lesson.
   Whatever the evidence is, the teacher is encouraged to use the learning
   they are doing in a lesson.
   Here is an example of one badge and what must be completed in other to
   earn a badge, Animoto Level 1...
     * Create an Animoto account (if you don't already have one)
     * Create a one-minute video aligned to your content area
     * Get the link and include it in the badge request form

How do you create the badges?

   I create the design for each badge using Google Drawing.  Why Google
   Drawing and not another design program?  Every design program has its
   benefits and purposes...I use multiple different ones depending on my
   project or mood!  Google Drawing works perfectly for me and how I set
   up the back end of my PD Badging Program by being able to publish an
   image to the web.
   When designing a badge,  I use the shapes and fonts available in Google
   Drawing.  I also use clip art from Miss Tiina, Creative Clips, Erin
   Bradley Designs, and Maree Truelove along with icons from The Noun
   Project. I also will usually include the logo of the particular tool or
   website the badge is for.

Where can I get your badges?

   Unfortunately you cannot earn my badges. (sorry!)  You also cannot buy
   my badges since I often create my badges using the logo from tools and
   websites belonging to others.  But you are in luck...I am sharing the
   PNGs for badges I have created and will create with you...
   [pub?w=1391&amp;h=646]
   Just click here to access the Google Drive folder where you can
   download a copy of the badges you would like use.

Do teachers get a physical badge?

   Yes!  When a badge is requested and approved, the teacher gets a
   certificate of completion as well as a physical badge!  The physical
   badge is removable vinyl sticker, which can be placed on most surfaces
   without leaving any residue.  I use Sticker You.com because I have
   found it to be the most affordable.  On Sticker You.com, I can get a
   sheet of 20-2 inch by 2 inch stickers for $9.99, but when you buy more
   sheets of stickers the cost of each sheet decreases.
   [pub?w=480&amp;h=480]

I think I covered everything you could want to know about badges portion of
my PD Badging program, but, if you have additional questions, please ask them
in the comments!  Be on the look out for more information about PD Badging.
