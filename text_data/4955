Our motivation

   Today there are thousands of companies that track your activity and
   personal information. But there’s a huge disconnect between how our
   data is actually collected, sold, or shared, and what we may actually
   want. Disconnect is founded on the belief that privacy is a fundamental
   human right: that people should have the freedom to move about the
   internet - and their lives - without anyone looking over their
   shoulder.

Your data, not theirs

   Thousands of corporations, cybercriminals, and government entities are
   keeping track of your activity online and offline in ways you wouldn’t
   expect or want. Your data is used to created a profile of who you are,
   what you do, and where you go. This profile not only determines the ads
   you see, but the prices you pay and even decisions that are made about
   things as important as your health insurance and employment. Our
   tracker protection powers meaningful privacy for hundreds of millions
   of people.

Secure your identity

   Our encrypted Virtual Private Network technology prevents eavesdroppers
   from collecting your sensitive online activity and personal
   information, like passwords, financial, and health information. Our Pro
   and Premium products secure all your internet connections and our full
   VPN Premium products mask your IP address to further protect your
   privacy and security. We never log, track, or collect any of your
   online activity or personal information.
   Secure your identity

   Better performance

Better performance

   By blocking hundreds of invisible tracker requests every day inside
   your browser and apps, Disconnect significantly accelerates page and
   app loads. We co-published an extensive study with the Firefox team
   that showed our tracker protection more than doubled browsing speeds!
   Our apps also extend mobile battery life and reduce wasted bandwidth.
