In An Evergreen Battle Against Heat, Austin Turns To Trees

       City of Austin

   Judging from how hot it has been, this year could end up being Austin’s
   hottest ever. Heat impacts health, happiness and the environment. So
   the city is trying a simple approach to reducing it: planting trees.

   But those efforts have raised some interesting questions about what
   exactly to plant in a climate that is rapidly changing.

   Trees can be an effective tool in the battle against heat, because our
   local climate is, in part, determined by our built environment. Cities
   are often around 5 degrees hotter in the day and more than 20 degrees
   hotter at night than surrounding country, according to the EPA.

   [screen_shot_2017-05-16_at_8.43.44_am.png] Emily King with the City of
   Austin's Urban Forestry Department.

   “Cities are just natural heat pockets, where heat sinks” said the
   city’s Leah Haney. “It’s something that's special that happens when you
   have a lot of manmade materials.”

   So, partnering with local nonprofits like TreeFolks, Austin distributes
   4,200 trees every year for the specific purpose of combating urban
   heat.

   “When trees have enough room to grow, and they’re healthy, they do this
   amazing thing where they actually cause the air around them to be
   cooler through a process called evapotranspiration,” said Emily King,
   with the city’s Urban Forestry Department.

   The process can drop the temperature around a tree by up to 9 degrees.

   “The whole impetus behind this program and this funding is to help cool
   Austin, to help shade it and help cool it,” said King. That's one
   reason tree planters even use satellite images to look for bald spots
   in the urban canopy where more trees can go.

   [emily_pic_1.jpg] Thermal data collected from a satellite in 2009 shows
   the hottest spots in Austin, the hottest of which included Mueller,
   Barton Creek Mall and downtown.

   Austin’s not the only place giving it a shot.

   “The research shows that for every 10 to 15 percent of increase in
   canopy cover you can reduce the urban temperature by up to five degrees
   Celsius” said Cathy Oke, a city council member in Melbourne, Australia.
   “So we have a target to double our canopy cover.”

   But there’s a problem in both Melbourne and Austin. Over the years,
   trees have been are dying faster than they can be replaced. Some of
   it’s because of development. Some of it’s because old age and, drought.
   And, in some cases, it’s because new invasive trees are taking over
   native species.

   The power of invasive trees was on full display earlier this year in
   Walnut Creek Park, where volunteer Cliff Tyllick pointed to a spot
   where invasive ligustrum had sprouted up in a section of forest.

   “The tree we see leaning there is a pecan. It died in the drought.
   Ligustrum is all around it," he said. He pointed to another tree, an
   escarpment black cherry, that also died in the drought. The
   ligustrum surrounding it were thriving.

   Scenes like this illustrate how local trees that evolved to survive
   this harsh weather eventually fell victim to the drought, while some of
   the invasive species actually survived it. That begs the question: If
   the city is planting trees to prepare for Austin’s hotter future,
   should some of these exotic species – the very plants that seem so
   resilient in the dryness and heat – be included in that plan?

   King said that's a loaded question in tree circles.

   "Depending on who you ask, you’re going to get a different answer to
   what should we be doing ," she said.

   Cathy Oke said Melbourne is planting a mix of native and exotic
   species.

   [screen_shot_2017-05-16_at_8.07.50_am.png] Trees can function as
   outdoor AC units, thanks to evapotranspiration.
   Trees can function as outdoor AC units, thanks to evapotranspiration.

   But Meg Inglis of the Native Plant Society of Texas says, as far as
   climate change is concerned, she would hedge her bets with natives.

   She says a lot of introduced species are just too destructive. They
   starve out local wildlife, suck up too much water and generally turn
   ecosystems on their heads.

   “If the ecosystem collapses then we lose ecosystem services that are
   provided to us like sequestering of carbon, providing oxygen, putting
   more water into the aquifer,” she said.

   But what if the ecosystem is already changing? Since we don’t know
   exactly how hot, dry or flood-prone climate change will make us, does
   it make sense to hedge our bets by bringing in some outside trees?

   “I don’t think that we can be overly picky with where exactly something
   originated, if our end goal is to make sure Austin remains liveable,”
   said King. “And to be liveable, we do need to try to reduce the heat
   that we’re experiencing.”

   A lot of this is just a question of how you define “native.” Is it a
   plant from a bit south of here that’s now spreading in? An introduced
   tree that’s been here for centuries?

   Tyllick, the invasive species removal volunteer, said he prefers
   natives but adds that, within that range, you can find a lot of things
   to plant.

   “A nice thing about this particular replanting program is that they’re
   planting lots of different species and the ones that do well in the
   conditions we end up having over the next five, 10, 15 years are the
   ones that will thrive."

How Austin's Hotter Weather Is Bad For Mental Health

   Depending on what thermometer you’re looking at, this year’s average
   temperature has been between 5 and 7 degrees hotter than usual so far
   in Austin. That could set 2017 up to be one of Austin’s hottest years
   ever.  People who research climate change already know a lot about how
   warmer temperatures disrupt human activity. But hot days may have an
   impact on our mental health that we’re only just starting to
   understand.

   The City of Austin has unveiled a new blueprint for its zoning
   overhaul, known as CodeNEXT – a plan aims to manage growth and
   transportation challenges by rewriting Austin's land-use code.

   But critics say, for a city that prides itself on its environmentalism,
   Austin has failed to take into account one important thing in CodeNEXT:
   the future impact of climate change.

Bill Seeks Restrictions On Dumping Treated Wastewater In Central Texas Creeks

   The population boom in Central Texas has brought a lot of challenges to
   the region – some expected, some less so. One question you may not have
   considered is what happens to all the extra sewage water produced by
   the growing population. Now, a bill at the state Capitol hopes to
   answer that very question.

   With unseasonably hot temperatures in Austin this fall, it’s a great
   time to take a swim in the city’s premier swimming hole.

   Barton Springs Pool is a constant 70 degrees, more than cool enough to
   help you chill out no matter how hot it is outside. But that’s also
   chilly enough to make it kind of uncomfortable to get into at first.
   That led Susan Somers-Willett to ask our ATXplained project this
   question:
