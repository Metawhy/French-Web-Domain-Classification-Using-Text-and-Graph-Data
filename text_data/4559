HOW DOES IT PLAY?

   how_does_it_play
   [features_1-350x150.png]

CHALLENGING WORDPLAY

   Spell words to attack monsters – it sounds so simple. Mix in poison,
   spike, stone, whirlwind, flipped, broken, duplicator, and plague tiles
   and it suddenly becomes a lot more challenging!
   [features_2-350x150.png]

UPGRADE EVERYTHING

   Upgrade your character. Choose some books and upgrade them! Then choose
   from several different weapons and – you guessed it – upgrade those
   too!
   [features_3-350x150.png]

BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK

   Tons of gorgeous art – the adorable Grimm and Rose, over 30 hand-drawn
   monsters, lots of stage backgrounds, and much more, all
   retina-optimized.
   [features_4-350x150.png]

TONS OF CONTENT

   40 stages that can each be played in 4 different ways, including the
   ultra-difficult crystal stars that will challenge even the wordiest
   wordsmiths!
