   This plugin adds support for table column resizing with your
   mouse. Hover your mouse over the column border to see the cursor
   change to indicate that the column can be resized. Click and drag your
   mouse to set the desired column width.

   Note: Do not confuse it with the native browser resize tools that are
   available in Firefox and Internet Explorer.

   This plugin complements the Table plugin which provides basic table
   operations.

     The last month I had a pleasure to work closely with CKEditor 5,
     integrating it into Neos CMS. I was never really a fan of CKEditor
     4, but CKEditor 5 has become one of my favorite opensource projects.

   Dmitri Pisarev

   Neos CMS

     Back in 2012, I started to research tools to get a real-time
     collaborative editor working on Rails. I just achieved that tonight.
     The trick was to wait years for a team of super talented devs to
     solve this super hard problem. Thanks, CKEditor!
