    The European Committee of Central Balance-Sheet Data Offices (ECCBSO)
   is a consultative body created in 1987 by a group of European National
      Central Banks (NCBs) managing Central Balance Sheet Data Offices
                                  (CBSOs).

    The initial objective of the Committee was to improve the analysis of
   non-financial corporations’ data by exchanging information, refining
     the processing techniques and accomplishing tasks collectively. The
      objectives of the Committee have been widened to cover the use of
 non-financial corporations’ data to accomplish central banks’ functions
       in such fields as statistics, economic and financial research,
   financial stability, supervision and risk assessment, among others, and
  may contribute to achieving the national statistical institutes’ (NSIs)
   goals. The Committee’s objectives also include: improving the analysis
    of non-financial corporations, promoting the work carried out by the
    different national CBSOs among the members of the European System of
      Central Banks (ESCB), and exploiting synergies with the European
    Central Bank (ECB), Eurostat and the NSIs, as information on balance
   sheet data of non-financial corporations is relevant for the functions
   of the ESCB and the Eurosystem, as well as for the European Statistical
                                   System.

     The Chairman is elected every three years among the members of the
    Institutions joining the Committee. The Secretariat is ensured by the
   body whose representative has been elected as Chairman and lasts during
     his mandate. The meetings of the ECCBSO take place at least once a
                                    year.

      The Committee has developed a database named Bank for Accounts of
                        Companies Harmonized (BACH).

     The Committee has also created several Working Groups to deal with
                             specific subjects.
