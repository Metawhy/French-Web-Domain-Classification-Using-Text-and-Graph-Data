   HIGHLIGHTS

   • The UN and humanitarian partners are closely following up on
   corroborated reports received of 30 people being injured and
   hospitalised following violence in the Qasr Ben Ghashir detention
   center, where some 890 refugees and migrants are located.Efforts are
   underway for the urgent relocation of all individuals to safer areas.

   • Vital humanitarian assistance, including urgently needed medical
   supplies, are reported to be held in warehouses pending customs and
   inspection procedures. Humanitarian partners maintain that especially
   at times when humanitarian needs are high, assistance needs to reach
   those in need without any delay owed to administrative procedures.

   SITUATION OVERVIEW

   • For the second night in a row, relative calm has prevailed, with the
   exception of airstrikes against military positions in Wadi Al Rabi and
   artillery/shelling reported overnight 22-23 April in the vicinity of
   Tripoli International Airport and Ain Zara. This is likely to be due to
   prevailing weather conditions.

   • At least 90 civilian casualties, including 21 fatalities, have been
   verified since the beginning of the conflict.1 These casualties include
   medical personnel, women and children, and at least one foreign
   national.

   • Approximately 35,000 displaced individuals have been identified since
   the onset of the crisis.2 The majority of IDPs are staying with family
   or in private accommodations, while over 2,200 IDPs are currently
   sheltered in 16 collective centres set up by local authorities. An
   unconfirmed number of families remain stranded in conflict-affected
   areas, since neither side has responded to calls for humanitarian
   pauses to enable their departure. This includes nearly 3,600 refugees
   and migrants trapped in detention centres (DCs) located in conflict-
   affected areas or in areas at risk of armed conflict. The humanitarian
   community continues to call on all parties to the conflict to negotiate
   humanitarian pauses to allow for civilians to move freely to safer
   areas and for assistance to reach those in need, and to nominate
   humanitarian focal points to facilitate these ends

South Sudan: Humanitarian Response Eases Famine, But Food Insecurity Reaches
Unprecedented Levels

   Report
   from UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
   Published on 22 Jun 2017
   preview
   Download PDF (200.74 KB)

   (Juba, 22 June 2017): The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan,
   Eugene Owusu, today welcomed the findings of the latest Integrated
   Phase Classification (IPC) data which highlight that early warning and
   the mobilization of a large-scale, multi-sectoral humanitarian
   response, have eased famine in Leer and Mayendit counties, and
   prevented it in Koch and Panyijiar counties, in South Sudan.

   “I applaud the humanitarian community for the rapid scale-up of
   humanitarian response in famine-affected and at-risk areas in Unity,”
   said Mr. Owusu. “We deployed teams to dangerous and difficult locations
   and faced many challenges along the way, including clashes which forced
   us to relocate aid workers and delay distributions. But we were not
   dissuaded, and our collective efforts ultimately prevented the
   catastrophe from escalating.”

   The Humanitarian Coordinator, however, urged the international
   community and humanitarian actors not to become complacent, as an
   unprecedented 6 million people are now severely food insecure,
   including 45,000 facing catastrophic food insecurity in Leer, Koch and
   Mayendit in Unity, and Ayod in Jonglei, and 1.7 million in IPC Phase 4,
   on the brink of famine.

   “Half of the people across this country are severely food insecure, we
   are facing the longest and most widespread cholera outbreak since South
   Sudan became independent, and the number of people internally displaced
   has topped 2 million,” warned Mr. Owusu. “These are the devastating
   consequences of conflict, which has taken a daily toll on the desperate
   civilians of this nation.”

   Following the famine declaration, humanitarian organizations ramped-up
   their response in Leer, Mayendit, Koch and Panyinjiar, reaching more
   than 320,000 people. Rapid response missions were carried out in at
   least 17 locations, and humanitarian organizations delivered vital and
   life-saving services, including food, emergency healthcare,
   vaccinations, nutritional treatments, seeds and tools for livelihoods,
   clean water, and critical non-food items, such as blankets, kitchen
   sets and mosquito nets. Each of these interventions played a critical
   role in halting and preventing famine.

   “Despite the good news today that we have arrested the localized famine
   in Leer and Mayendit, we face greater needs in South Sudan than ever
   before,” said Mr. Owusu. “This is the time to redouble our efforts and
   expand our response. To do this, we urgently need free, safe and
   unhindered humanitarian access, and funding to respond to the
   escalating crisis. I call on all parties to the conflict to cease
   attacks against civilians, and to uphold their responsibilities under
   international humanitarian law. Until the violence stops, humanitarian
   needs will continue to grow.”

   HIGHLIGHTS

   • The UN and humanitarian partners are closely following up on
   corroborated reports received of 30 people being injured and
   hospitalised following violence in the Qasr Ben Ghashir detention
   center, where some 890 refugees and migrants are located.Efforts are
   underway for the urgent relocation of all individuals to safer areas.

   • Vital humanitarian assistance, including urgently needed medical
   supplies, are reported to be held in warehouses pending customs and
   inspection procedures. Humanitarian partners maintain that especially
   at times when humanitarian needs are high, assistance needs to reach
   those in need without any delay owed to administrative procedures.

   SITUATION OVERVIEW

   • For the second night in a row, relative calm has prevailed, with the
   exception of airstrikes against military positions in Wadi Al Rabi and
   artillery/shelling reported overnight 22-23 April in the vicinity of
   Tripoli International Airport and Ain Zara. This is likely to be due to
   prevailing weather conditions.

   • At least 90 civilian casualties, including 21 fatalities, have been
   verified since the beginning of the conflict.1 These casualties include
   medical personnel, women and children, and at least one foreign
   national.

   • Approximately 35,000 displaced individuals have been identified since
   the onset of the crisis.2 The majority of IDPs are staying with family
   or in private accommodations, while over 2,200 IDPs are currently
   sheltered in 16 collective centres set up by local authorities. An
   unconfirmed number of families remain stranded in conflict-affected
   areas, since neither side has responded to calls for humanitarian
   pauses to enable their departure. This includes nearly 3,600 refugees
   and migrants trapped in detention centres (DCs) located in conflict-
   affected areas or in areas at risk of armed conflict. The humanitarian
   community continues to call on all parties to the conflict to negotiate
   humanitarian pauses to allow for civilians to move freely to safer
   areas and for assistance to reach those in need, and to nominate
   humanitarian focal points to facilitate these ends

South Sudan: Humanitarian Response Eases Famine, But Food Insecurity Reaches
Unprecedented Levels

   Report
   from UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
   Published on 22 Jun 2017
   preview
   Download PDF (200.74 KB)

   (Juba, 22 June 2017): The Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan,
   Eugene Owusu, today welcomed the findings of the latest Integrated
   Phase Classification (IPC) data which highlight that early warning and
   the mobilization of a large-scale, multi-sectoral humanitarian
   response, have eased famine in Leer and Mayendit counties, and
   prevented it in Koch and Panyijiar counties, in South Sudan.

   “I applaud the humanitarian community for the rapid scale-up of
   humanitarian response in famine-affected and at-risk areas in Unity,”
   said Mr. Owusu. “We deployed teams to dangerous and difficult locations
   and faced many challenges along the way, including clashes which forced
   us to relocate aid workers and delay distributions. But we were not
   dissuaded, and our collective efforts ultimately prevented the
   catastrophe from escalating.”

   The Humanitarian Coordinator, however, urged the international
   community and humanitarian actors not to become complacent, as an
   unprecedented 6 million people are now severely food insecure,
   including 45,000 facing catastrophic food insecurity in Leer, Koch and
   Mayendit in Unity, and Ayod in Jonglei, and 1.7 million in IPC Phase 4,
   on the brink of famine.

   “Half of the people across this country are severely food insecure, we
   are facing the longest and most widespread cholera outbreak since South
   Sudan became independent, and the number of people internally displaced
   has topped 2 million,” warned Mr. Owusu. “These are the devastating
   consequences of conflict, which has taken a daily toll on the desperate
   civilians of this nation.”

   Following the famine declaration, humanitarian organizations ramped-up
   their response in Leer, Mayendit, Koch and Panyinjiar, reaching more
   than 320,000 people. Rapid response missions were carried out in at
   least 17 locations, and humanitarian organizations delivered vital and
   life-saving services, including food, emergency healthcare,
   vaccinations, nutritional treatments, seeds and tools for livelihoods,
   clean water, and critical non-food items, such as blankets, kitchen
   sets and mosquito nets. Each of these interventions played a critical
   role in halting and preventing famine.

   “Despite the good news today that we have arrested the localized famine
   in Leer and Mayendit, we face greater needs in South Sudan than ever
   before,” said Mr. Owusu. “This is the time to redouble our efforts and
   expand our response. To do this, we urgently need free, safe and
   unhindered humanitarian access, and funding to respond to the
   escalating crisis. I call on all parties to the conflict to cease
   attacks against civilians, and to uphold their responsibilities under
   international humanitarian law. Until the violence stops, humanitarian
   needs will continue to grow.”
