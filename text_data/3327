Look Du Jour: Roses Season

   Did I say “roses season”? Silly me. Of course I meant rosé season!
   London has been experiencing a serious heatwave so the streets are full
   of floral frocks and our livers saturated with the pink drink of
   dreams. There are also shirtless/swimwear clad Brits splayed all over
   every single surface one could conceivably sunbathe on. Poolside at
   Shoreditch House, scrubby grass by Soho Square, side of the road… When
   the sun comes out over excitement sets in and any semblance of self
   restraint goes straight out the window. When I…

   ten consecutive summers now? Not that I’m complaining. Whether in the
   form of a slouchy shirt, sculptural silhouetted blouse or sweet
   sundress, gingham is just plain great. Speaking of sundresses, how
   adorable is this little number from Superdry?! And where better to wear

   Spring has sprung! Or more accurately, we had a few days of heatwave

   then back to heat, a cycle which will continue on repeat… much like
   every other April to May transition in the history of British weather.
   But whether it’s shirts off scorching or February freezing, the time
   has come to segway into Spring attire. Having spent what feels like a

   First and foremost, how the HELL is it Christmas already!?! I know
   that’s a painfully cliched thing to say. Not to mention something
   you’ve already had pointless conversations about with every

   happy to see the back of 2017 and very excited for the year to come.

   Can you actually believe that I managed not to give this Look Du Jour a

   well, I have a long standing obsession with all things nautical. An
   obsession that has resulted in my owning at least twenty-six sailor
   striped tees and sporting an anchor tattoo on my right buttock, true

A Day at the Polo with Avenue 32

   avenue 32

   avenue 32

   Aren’t British Summer traditions just the best? Admittedly they would
   be that bit better if the weather wasn’t quite so *ahem* unpredictable
   but drizzle aside, few things beat an afternoon spent watching tennis,
   cricket, racing or as is the subject of this post, polo. A couple of
   weeks ago a very exciting email arrived in my inbox, inviting me to
   spend a day enjoying that poshest of pursuits courtesy of cooler than
   cool designer e-tailer, Avenue 32. But, as I soon realised, this
   invitation wasn’t just to watch polo, oh no, Avenue 32 would be
   treating us to an actual polo lesson at Guards Polo Club too!

   As you may or may not know, I spent most of my childhood and early
   teenage years clad in jodhpurs and aboard (or not aboard) various
   stroppy ponies. So when the opportunity arose to get back in the
   saddle, I didn’t need to be asked twice. In fact I got so over excited
   about the whole thing I even dug out all my riding gear and felt pretty
   profesh and generally smug as I set out for the Karla Otto offices
   (where we’d be meeting to get our suitably posh coach to Windsor)…
   Until I arrived that is. I don’t know whether you ever had the
   experience of dressing up to the nines for home clothes day at school
   only to discover that the older, cooler girls didn’t bother and
   subsequently feeling like world’s biggest fool in your spangly frock.
   Well, I had the unpleasant experience of re-living that feeling of
   mortification when I arrived clad in head-to-toe riding gear (including
   a “Keep Hunting” polo shirt… cringe) to discover that everyone else was
   wearing Current Elliott jeans, flat sandals and leather jackets. Add to
   that the fact that my fellow polo goers included journo’s from Grazia,
   Vogue, i-D and POP Magazines and it should come as no surprise to hear
   that I felt like a prize idiot. Still there was no going back so I
   decided to just try not to give away how embarrassed I was. After forty
   five minutes of merry chatting on the bus I’d almost forgotten about my
   attire and arrived ready and raring to go.

   Avenue 32

   We drew up alongside the immaculate polo pitch to be greeted by a line
   up of equally immaculate ponies and two tables laden with coffee,
   croissants and bacon sandwiches. Once we’d all re-caffeinated ourselves
   three dashing chaps (who, it transpired, were in fact England team polo
   coaches!) appeared and it was time to get the lesson underway.

   After kicking off with a bit of on-foot hitting practice we progressed
   to wooden model horses (so we could practice using full size clubs
   without risk of knocking real life nags unconscious) and then finally
   to the beasts themselves. As one of the few of us with much riding
   experience, I was assigned “Black Bird”, a gratifyingly up for it
   animal who lept to attention at the slightest squeeze of my heels. The
   horsey ones among you probably know this already but for those that
   don’t, riding polo style is totally different to other types. With one
   hand devoted to holding the wrist achingly heavy stick, steering,
   stopping and starting is done solely with the other hence why, as one
   of the dashing coaches told us, polo players are dubbed “cowboys” by
   the rest of the equestrian community. This one handed riding style
   means that the ponies have to be insanely well trained and riding Black
   Bird was like cruising in a well oiled automatic sports car. But while
   I loved being able to turn my steed with a subtle flick of the wrist,
   actually trying to hit the ball was another thing. I did manage a
   couple of decent shots but there was a lot more random flailing than
   stick/ball contact. Flailing aside, by the time our hour was up I was
   hooked. Black Bird better watch out as I may be returning soon!

   After a couple of semi-successful attempts to get a group shot of us
   all on horseback we dismounted and piled back onto the coach to hit the
   spa for a little post polo beautification. Much as I love riding gear,
   I was pretty relieved to change into something that a) didn’t smell of
   horse and b) wouldn’t make me feel like quite such an over keen loser.
   Given the murky weather, even I didn’t feel brave enough to attempt
   bare legs so opted for the paisley trouser suit I bought in Topshop
   last september. Once everyone was suitably groomed it was back onto the
   bus (didn’t actually have to walk all day, awesome) and off to the
   Avenue 32 pop up boutique AKA the reason we were enjoying a lovely day
   at Guards Polo Club. I can’t imagine that recreating a store ambiance
   online is exactly a walk in the park but translating a slick website
   into an actual, 3D “thing” must be seriously difficult. The fact that
   the hub of stylish cool that is Avenue 32 managed it perfectly was both
   impressive and entirely unsurprising.

   Avenue 32

   It’s basically an unwritten rule that no matter what time a fashion
   event is held, large amount of champagne must be served. Generally
   speaking, I steer clear of the booze until at least 6 o’clock but
   decided to make an exception on this occasion and accepted a glass
   while we cooed over Avenue 32’s exciting new designers. Over a long and
   extremely delicious lunch in the exclusive Guards Club House
   conversation expanded to cover everything from love lives to leather
   trousers. It’s not that often I get to sit down and have a good, long
   chat with the editors behind my favourite fash mags and the founder of
   a hotter-than-hot designer emporium so it was a real privilege to get
   to last week.

   By the time we’d polished off pudding (a delectable fruit parfait type
   thing) it was time for the Cartier Queen’s Cup Semi Final to begin and
   we headed, or rather waddled, out to take our seats alongside the
   pitch. As with any sport, professional polo players make it look like
   an absolute piece of cake. Having experiences how impossible it is to
   hit a ball while sitting on a walking horse just hours before, I was
   truly awestruck by the handsome chaps galloping around the field. I’m
   not going to lie, I didn’t entirely understand what was going on or who
   was who but still got stuck in whooping and cheering until it was time
   to go home.

   Thank you Avenue 32 and Karla Otto for a fantastic day! Watch this
   space for my potential career change…
