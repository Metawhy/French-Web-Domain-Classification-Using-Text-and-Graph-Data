2018 Book List

   By Sabrina January 01, 2019
   Hello! It's my once a year blog post! ðŸ˜Š  This year, as I do every year,
   I make a goal to read 52 books. This year I went above and beyond and
   read 56 books! I probably could've read more but I took the month of
   December off to watch Hallmark Christmas movies.
   This is the first year in a long time, I didn't have a book that I
   absolutely loved. I really enjoyed a lot of books, but none of them
   wowed me. I also read quite a few okay books, and a couple boring books
   that did nothing for me.
   I use the Goodreads star system to rate my books.  5 stars being the
   best, 1 being the worst.
   5 Stars:
   Little Women by Louisa May Alcott
   Mudbound by Hillary Jordan
   The Hating Game by Sally Thorne
   The Cut Flower Garden by Erin Benzakein
   Happiness: The Crooked Little Road to Semi-Forever by Heather Harpham
   What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton
   Caroline: Little House, Revisited by Sarah Miller
   The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah
   Educated by Tara Westover

Books I Read in 2017

   By Sabrina January 01, 2018
   This year of reading was especially exciting because I hit my goal of
   reading 52 books! I read a lot of great books, many pretty good books,
   some just okay books and a couple of duds.  I usually have one book I
   read that stands out as the best of the year, but this year I didn't
   read anything that was so amazing that I had to share with the world.
   But I did read 14 books that I really enjoyed!I am going to do my
   usualGoodreads star ratings of books. 5 being the best, 1 being the
   worst.

Books I Read in 2016

   By Sabrina January 01, 2017
   Happy New Year!!! Last night was the first time in a really long time I
   stayed up until midnight. I was watching the Gilmore Girls revival on
   Netflix. I had just finished two months of watching the Gilmore Girls
   series. It was strange going from 2007 Gilmores to 2016 Gilmores. But
   that could be a whole different blog post.
   Books! My goal, as always, is to read 52 books. I read 39. I almost
   finished my 40th book, but really I was only half way through, so I
   couldn't count that. But 39 is pretty good! Considering I pretty much
   took November & December off from reading so I could watch GG. And I
   only read 16 books in 2015 So I would say, I did a pretty good job of
   reading books.
   I think this year I will list my books by the Goodreads star method.
   And I'll highlight a few of my favorites.
   5 Stars:
   Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi ****** My favorite book this year!
   Eligible by Curtis Sittenfeld **** I loved this modern day take on
   Pride & Prejudice!
   When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kaâ€¦

Someone is 4!

   By Sabrina December 19, 2016
   My not so little Deacon is 4 years old! I'm really having trouble with
   this one, because he was always my little guy. But now he is a big
   dude, going to preschool and totally into collecting Pokemon cards! We
   just love this happy, independent, smart, and silly guy so much!

9 Books

   By Sabrina November 10, 2016
   Heeeyyyy
   I have about 8 weeks left until the end of the year and I'm determined
   to read 8 books, 9 if I can be productive.
   The problem is, I've jumped on the Gilmore Girls bandwagon. I've never
   watched and it's not really my favorite show ever, but now I'm sucked
   in.  This puts a slight glitch in my reading plan, but I'll dedicate
   time each night to reading. Promise.
   1. Today Will be Different, Maria Semple
   2. To the Bright Edge of the World, Eowyn Ivey
   3. This was Not the Plan, Christina Alger
   4. The Light Between Oceans, M.L. Stedman
   5. The One-in-a-Million Boy, Monica Wood
   6. The Wangs Vs. The World, Jade Chang
   7. Hag-Seed, Margaret Atwood
   8. The Mothers, Brit Bennett
   9. Love Warrior, Glennon Doyle Melton
   I already have three books lined up that I'm going to read after the
   New Year.
   Commonwealth, Ann Patchett
   The Underground Railroad, Colson Whitehead
   A Good Time for Truth: Race in Minnesota
   plus the other 200+ book on my Kindle and in my book bin.

Easter

   By Sabrina March 28, 2016
   Another fun and celebrated Easter came and went. The day before Easter
   we went to our town's annual Easter Egg hunt. Not only did we dominate
   in the egg collecting, Finnley won a trike! We went home and dyed eggs
   and got ready for our Sunday guests. Easter Sunday we had lots of
   family over and enjoyed some delicious food. All in all a successful
   weekend.

   Hello! I'm Sabrina, welcome to my blog! I've been blogging for over ten
   years in this space. I am a wife and mom of three boys. I write about a
   lot of things, but my favorite things are books, crafts, and mom life.
   Thank you for visiting!
