DiskMaker X

   Build a macOS install disk.

   Ready for

   macOS Mojave.
   feature1

   DiskMaker X (formerly Lion DiskMaker) is an application built with
   AppleScript that you can use with many versions of OS X/macOS to build
   a bootable drive from OS X/macOS installer program (the one you
   download from the App Store). As soon as you launch the application, it
   tries to find the OS X Install program with Spotlight. Then, it
   proposes to build a bootable install disk and make it look as nice as
   possible. Itâ€™s the easiest way to build an OS X/macOS Installer in a
   few clicks! Then you can use the Install drive to fully re-install the
   OS on a freshly formated drive, or install it on your many Macs without
   re-downloading the full installer.

   Now compatible with macOS Mojave!

About Lion DiskMaker and Mavericks GM

   On October 4, 2013, in Uncategorized, by Guillaume GÃ¨te

   Apple finally announced to all Mac developers that OS X 10.9 Mavericks
   is now available for developers as a Golden Master (GM).

   Of course, this has some consequences over Lion DiskMaker  as it needs
   many modifications to work properly with this final version. And I have
   to squash many nasty bugs due to changes performed in the way Mavericks
   deals with packages and its boot OS.

   It means that it will take a bit of time before I can propose a nice
   version of Lion DiskMaker for 10.9. I plan to make a new beta available
   within the week-end, then work towards the final version for the
   official Mavericks release, which should happen before the end of
   October.

   There will be also many substantial changes in Lion DiskMaker. I prefer
   to keep some of the new features secret for this time. But some of them
   should be really cool ðŸ™‚

   However, Iâ€™d like also to use this blog post to talk about one feature
   you wonâ€™t see in Lion DiskMaker 3: DVD-R support.

   Two years ago, I thought Lion DiskMaker was useful  to build a bootable
   USB key, but also to burn a bootable install disk. It was okay at this
   time to use a DVD-R as Lion could fit in a single standard DVD-R .
   Today, burning Mountain Lion or Mavericks on a disk is not that easy ,
   as the DVD-R are just too small to fit the full OS X install. So you
   need to use DVD-R Dual Layer (or DVD+R DL), which are waaaaaay more
   expensive. In the same time, USB thumb drives became ubuquitous, their
   price fell, and you can just get an 8 GB drive for a few bucks (about
   $7). Think about it: you can buy for the price of a few coffees a disk
   16 times bigger than my first internal hard drive on my first Mac,
   almost 20 years ago. We came a long way, baby ðŸ™‚ And I have to admit
   that to deal with burning a disk using the drutil command line tool is
   just, wellâ€¦ almost impossible when done from Applescript, unless you
   accept not to have any feedback while the burning process happens.

   So at this time, I wonâ€™t add the feature to burn a disk in Lion
   DiskMaker. USB, Firewire,Thunderbolt or eSATA drives will be OK, as
   usual (though booting on eSATA may not be supported).

   Thanks everyone for supporting Lion DiskMaker. It became a hell of a
   softwareâ€¦ I did not think it would go so far when I began to work on it
   in July 2011. I really canâ€™t state how much I appreciated every
   feedback (and donation, of course ðŸ™‚ ) Iâ€™ve got in the last two years,
   and I hope that the next version will be even more useful for every one
   of you !
