Happy Holidays & So Long, Paper Crave

   December 19, 2018 // kristen // 10 replies

   Happy Holidays + So Long, Paper Crave

   I’m wrapping things up for the year over here a bit early this year,
   and I want to wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy and Healthy
   New Year!

   Sadly, this is also a goodbye. Paper Crave started out as a side
   project for me way, way back in 2006, and over the years it’s provided
   an outlet for me to share my love for all things paper. It’s also
   allowed me to meet so, so many amazing and talented people in the
   stationery, paper goods, paper crafts, and creative communities. I’m
   incredibly thankful for the many opportunities that this blog has
   brought, and I’m incredibly grateful to you for taking time to check
   out what’s going on over here over the years. Thank you SO much for
   everything!

   It’s been a very difficult decision for me to make, but all good things
   must come to an end, and it’s time to say “so long” to this wonderful
   blog. But I’m definitely not saying goodbye to my love for all things
   paper!

   I’ll continue regularly pinning paper goods that catch my eye, as well
   as craft projects, lovely lettering, color and design inspiration, and
   much more over on Pinterest. And the Paper Crave site will remain for
   the foreseeable future as a catalog of the last 12+ years of paper
   cravings.

   My main focus going forward will be on my freelance work and on
   k.becca, where I sell and license my digital cut files, patterns, and
   other creative work. I’d love it if you’d join me over there, so if you
   like paper crafts, digital goodies, and die cutting, please come on
   over and join the fun!

   In addition to the k.becca website, you can also find me on Instagram,
   where I’m currently participating in a really fun, Christmas-themed
   illustration challenge, as well as over on YouTube, where I share craft
   tutorial videos.

   Here’s a quick list of links where you can find me:

   YouTube
   Pinterest

   Thank you, again, for the last 12+ years. It’s been so much fun, and I
   can’t tell you how much I’ve appreciated all of your comments, emails,
   and just the time that you’ve taken to pop in here to see my latest
   paper cravings.

   So long, Paper Crave!
