Get Enough

Paul McCartney

   There was a time when we walked by the docks
   I told you I’d need you all of my life
   And watching the chugs rolling by, together
   Do you remember?

   Do you remember the lights on the shore?
   How they reflected the rain on the road
   I believed that you loved me alone, it was real
   Do you remember?

   Now and then I see your face
   I’ve been wanting your loving embrace
   I’ve been looking for love but it gets me nowhere
   Oh yeah, yeah

   Get enough, get enough, get enough of
   Get enough, get enough, get enough of
   I can’t get enough of, of you

   It was a time we were all full of hope
   Saw the future burning bright
   As we watched the moon rolling out to sea
   Do you remember?

   But those days are erased from my mind
   I’ve left all those old days behind
   Still I remember your face, forever
   Forever

   Get enough, get enough, get enough of
   Get enough, get enough, get enough of
   I can’t get enough of, of you

   Get enough, get enough, get enough girl
   Get enough, get enough, get enough girl
   I can’t get enough
   Enough of you

Sixty Second Street

Paul McCartney

   You can make my life complete
   If you say that we could meet
   For a minute on
   Sixty Second Street

   The cities melting in the heat
   I’ve got my flip-flops on my feet
   See me walking down
   Sixty Second Street

   Well time is flying by so fast
   Each day quicker than the last
   It means I must be having fun
   I hope it carries on and on and on

   Sixty seconds of your day
   Is all I ask of you
   I only need a little time
   To show what I can do, do doodle, do do…

   We can grab a bite to eat
   Sit and listen to the beat
   Of the traffic on
   Sixty Second Street

   Well time is flying by so fast
   Each day quicker than the last
   It means I must be having fun
   I hope it carries on and on and on

   Sixty seconds of your day
   Is all I ask of you
   I only need a little time
   To show what I can do, do doodle, do, do…

   You can make my life complete
   If you say that we could meet
   For a minute on
   Sixty Second Street
   Just a minute on
   Sixty Second Street

   Just a minute on
   Sixty Second Street
   Sixty Second Street

Frank Sinatra’s Party

Paul McCartney

   We had the greatest time
   At Frank Sinatra’s party
   We drank expensive wine
   Then watched the night roll by

   I saw a showgirl dance
   With Sammy Davis Jr.
   They had a brief romance
   Under the desert sky

   Fee, fi, fo, fum
   I’m not the only Englishman
   I’m under cover but plenty of others
   Are already flying high

   See Angie Dickinson
   Bump into Peter Lawford
   She’s out to have some fun
   He doesn’t seem to mind

   You don’t have to doubt yourself
   No, not on a night like this

   Jump in the swimming pool
   Say hi to Dino Martin
   He’s hot to play it cool
   Watching the girls go by

   Fee, fi, fo, fum
   I’m not the only Englishman
   I’m under cover but some of my brothers
   Are already flying high

   Come and enjoy yourself
   At Frank Sinatra’s party
   We had the greatest time
   Watching the night go by

Nothing For Free

Paul McCartney

   I wonder why you’re coming to me
   I think you must want something for free
   I try to work out what i could say
   But my brain’s not working today

   I know you need something
   You’re talking to me
   You’re talking to me
   I know you need something
   What can it be
   What can it be
   I know you need something
   You’re talking to me
   But you don’t get nothing for free

   You’ve got a real cool way about you
   Is there a lot you want me to do
   I’d love to help out in any way
   But my brain stopped working today

   I know you need something
   You’re talking to me
   You’re talking to me
   I know you need something
   What can it be
   What can it be
   I know you need something
   You’re talking to me
   But you don’t get nothing for free

   I wanna tell you what it means to me
   I love you every way and now
   But i can’t make up my mind

   I wonder why you’re coming to me
   I think you must want something for free
   I’d love to help out in any way
   But my brain stopped working today

   I know you need something
   You’re talking to me
   You’re talking to me
   I know you need something
   What can it be
   What can it be

   I know you need something
   You’re talking to me
   But you don’t get nothing for free

   My brain stopped working
   My brain stopped working
   My brain stopped working today

Get Started

Paul McCartney

   So let’s get started
   I’m ready to be heard
   Before the dear departed
   Can have the final word

   In a perfect situation
   I’d have told you long ago
   But now i think it’s time
   You ought to know

   So let me tell you
   Right here and now
   I’m going to love you
   And i will tell you how

   I’ll give you my heart
   I’ll give you my word
   And we’ll get started now

   Oooh

   You’re not expected
   To stand on hallowed ground
   But know you’ll be protected
   As long as i am around

   To ensure there’s no confusion
   I would like to make it clear
   If you need my help
   I promise i’ll be here

   So let me tell you
   Right here and now
   I’m going to love you
   And i will tell you how

   I’ll give you my heart
   I’ll give you my word
   And we’ll get started now

   Oooh
