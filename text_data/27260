       EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR
       EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE,
       BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR
       CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE LIMITATIONS THAT ARE
       LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR LIABILITY
       WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
   16. SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS
       Your contract with us includes, at a minimum, these Terms. Your
       contract may also include “Supplemental Agreements” as you and we
       may agree in a separate writing from time to time. Where there is a
       contradiction between the Terms and any such Supplemental
       Agreements, the Supplemental Agreements will take precedence.
   17. SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS FOR SUBSCRIPTION PLANS
       Subscription. You may subscribe to the Service by choosing among
       available “Subscription Plans” whose features and costs are
       described on our Site. We will afford you (as well as other
       Registered Users affiliated with your Subscription, if any) with
       access to the Service for the term and with the feature-set and
       subject to bandwidth, capacity, and User Engagement Minute
       limitations of the Subscription Plan you choose for your respective
       domain(s). If you are the Subscriber of a multi-user Subscription
       Plan, you agree that (i) you will not allow access to the Service
       for a number of Registered Users in excess of the number authorized
       under your Subscription Plan; (ii) each Registered User who
       accesses the Service under your Subscription will do so before
       registering for, and then using, their own Account; and (iii) you
       will designate an “administrator” who will be responsible for
       supervising your Subscription Plan and those enrolled to access the
       Service your Subscription.
       Fees and Payments. You agree to pay the Subscription fees and any
       other charges (including any applicable taxes) incurred in
       connection with the Subscription Plan you choose at the rates in
       effect when the charges were incurred. Payments will be payable
       through the credit card that we have on record for you or within 30
       days of receipt of invoice if we elect to invoice you. You are
       responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access the Service
       through an Internet access provider or other third-party service.
       Monthly account balance and usage data are available online through
       the Service, and will not be separately provided to you. Our fees
       are payable in U.S. dollars, and are exclusive of all taxes,
       levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, for which you are
       responsible for payment.
       Delinquent Accounts. We reserve the right to suspend your access to
       the Service (without any corresponding adjustment to the term) if
       you are delinquent in paying your Subscription fees. Delinquent
       invoices are subject to interest of 1.5% per month on any
       outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is
       less, plus all expenses of collection. In addition, we reserve the
       right to impose a reconnection fee in the event we suspend your
       Subscription due to non-payment, and you thereafter request renewed
       Service. You agree and acknowledge that we are under no obligation
       to retain your Content, which may be irretrievably deleted if your
       account is more than thirty days past due.
       Term. The term of your Subscription begins immediately on the date
       of purchase and expires on the date that the specified period of
       your Subscription Plan ends.
       Renewal. Your Subscription will automatically renew effective on
       the date of its scheduled expiration for an identical term but at
       the then-prevailing fee unless, prior to the date that the
       Subscription expires, you or we terminate your Subscription. You
       must cancel your Subscription before it renews to avoid billing of
       Subscription fees for a renewal term.
       Suspension. You will not be able to suspend your use of the Service
       at any time.
       Early Termination. Either you or we may terminate your Subscription
       at any time prior to the end of the term if the other breaches any
       material provision of these Terms, including your failure to pay
       Subscription fees when due. In addition, you may terminate your
       Subscription if we materially change the features, capacity,
       service levels, or other metrics corresponding to your Subscription
       Plan; and we may terminate your Subscription at any time if (a) we
       are required to do so by law (for example, where our provision of
       the Service to you has become unlawful in the jurisdiction in which
       you reside; or (b) we determine in our sole judgment to discontinue
       the Service.
       Effect of Termination. Our obligation to make the Service available
       to you ends immediately upon the termination of your Subscription;
       all other provisions of these Terms shall survive termination in
       perpetuity. Upon termination, we will delete your Content from our
       system. We reserve the right to remove or discard your Content
       without notice for any breach, including your failure to pay
       Subscription fees when due. We will refund any portion of the
       Subscription fee paid but not yet earned, unless you terminate your
       Subscription without cause before the end of the term or we
       terminate your Subscription due to your breach of any material
       provision of these Terms.
   18. GOVERNING LAW; RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES
       These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
       the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of the Canada,
       without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You
       agree that you will resolve any claim, cause of action, or dispute
       you have with us arising out of or relating to these Terms or your
       access to the Site and use of the Service exclusively in the state
       or federal courts located in Toronto, Ontario, to which you hereby
       expressly submit to personal jurisdiction.
   19. GENERAL LEGAL PROVISIONS
       These Terms (along with Supplemental Agreements, if any) comprise
       the entire contract between you and us concerning the Site and the
       Service, and supersedes any prior contracts we may have with you.
       If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your employer or
       another entity, then “you” means that employer or entity and
       affiliates. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary
       right, power, and authority to enter into and perform under these
       Terms. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary
       rights, nor do these Terms prohibit us from complying with the law.
       If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the
       remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail
       to enforce any of these Terms, our failure will not be deemed a
       waiver. Instead, any waiver of these Terms, as well as any
       amendment or Supplemental Agreement to these Terms, must be made in
       a writing that we sign. You may not transfer any of your rights or
       obligations under these Terms without our consent. At the same
       time, however, we may freely assign all our rights and obligations
       under these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale
       of assets, or otherwise by operation of law.
   20. NOTICES
       You agree that any notices we send to you in relation to your use
       of the Service generally and to these Terms specifically may be
       sent via email to the address we have on file for your Account. You
       further agree that, with respect to changes we may make to these
       Terms, we may notify you either by sending an email or otherwise by
       posting a prominent notice on the home page of the Site for a
       period of time not less than ten days before the date the change
       takes effect. You are responsible for keeping the contact
       information in your Account current, and for accessing the Site
       periodically to view any changes to these Terms that we may make.

   You, in turn, will direct questions you have to us about the Service or
   about these Terms in the following manner:
