The Perfect Way to Start Your Day!

   Hello everyone! What do you do with some over ripe bananas that no one
   in the house wants to look at, much less eat? You make banana nut
   bread, of course! Today, I'd like to share my favorite banana nut bread
   recipe with you.

   Banana Nut Bread

   1 1/2 cups flour

   1/2 tsp. baking soda

   1/2 tsp. baking powder

   1/2 cup sugar

   1/2 cup packed brown sugar

   1/2 tsp. cinnamon

   1/2 cup chopped nuts (I like walnuts, but you can use your favorite)

   2 eggs, beaten

   1/2 cup vegetable oil

   1/2 cup mashed banana (I usually add about 3/4 cup cause we really like
   bananas)

   1 tsp. vanilla

   Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and
   nuts in a a bowl. In a seperate bowl, combine eggs, vegetable oil,
   bananas and vanilla, mixing well. Add wet ingredients to the dry
   ingredients and mix well. Pour into a nonstick 5 x 9 inch loaf pan.
   Bake at 350 degrees for about 55-65 minutes or until loaf tests done.
   Remove to a wire rack to cool.

   This is such a delicious, moist bread. You can also add a cup of
   chopped apples to this to make Banana Apple Bread. It's yummy, as well.

   Fresh and still warm from the oven, pair it with a cup of coffee and
   you've got the perfect way to start your day!

Pinterest Inspiration

   I loving decorating and accessorizing my home. But in this economy,
   money is tight and we are trying to live on a budget so there's not a
   lot of extra money to spend on home decor. I get a lot of inspiration
   from Pinterest. It's amazing all the wonderful ideas that are shared on
   that site. However, like a lot of other people, my time is very
   limited, what with working outside of the home at least three days a
   week and then having to keep up with all the household chores we all
   have to endure. So I'm all about projects that are simple and don't
   take a lot of time to complete, but do make a huge impact. Here's some
   of my favorites I've pinned and plan on completing this year.

   This is a super cute idea using wooden utensils to create a paper towel
   holder.

   I've seen versions of this next idea all over blog land. I was recently
   gifted two old salvaged windows from a friend and I'm seriously
   considering transforming one of them into something like this.

   This next idea is one that I have already put my own spin on and will
   share with y'all in an upcoming post. It was simple, quick, easy and
   has really made a big impact on my bedroom wall. I'm in the middle of a
   small cosmetic master bedroom redo so this idea was perfect for my
   "new" bedroom.

   And, finally, this little chalkboard tray is so cute. I think it would
   be perfect on a kitchen counter or baker's rack for grocery lists or a
   favorite recipe. The link to this has been removed so unfortunately, I
   cannot share credit for where this cute project came from.

   There are tons of other projects I've pinned that I would like to
   attempt someday. There are just a few of my favorites. How about you?
   Does Pinterest inspire you to create?

   Until next time...
