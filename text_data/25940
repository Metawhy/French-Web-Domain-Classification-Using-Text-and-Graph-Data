   WHERE TO EAT & DRINK

   Château des Pères

   If dining at ground level seems old hat, then La Table des Pères has
   the answer, offering a gastronomic meal six metres above the 31-hectare
   park of contemporary sculptures in the trees.
   www.chateaudesperes.fr/restaurant

   Chez Ty Kouign

   As the name suggests, this shop in Minihy-Tréguier specialises in
   Kouign-Amann (Brittany’s favourite butter-laden pastry). Not keen? They
   sell wonderful biscuits and honey too. www.cheztykouign.bzh

   Crêperie la Krampouzerie

   You can’t pay a visit to Brittany and not indulge in a sweet crêpe, or
   a savoury galette. This delightful crêperie overlooks the famous place
   au Beurre in Quimper, and has an extensive menu to choose from,
   including some very unusual ingredients, such as Basque sheep cheese
   and Ouessant seaweed. www.lakrampouzerie.wordpress.com
