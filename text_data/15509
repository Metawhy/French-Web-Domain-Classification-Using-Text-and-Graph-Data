   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   Every information on a number is the sum of all the experience the
   tellows users share via comments and by rating the number according to
   its danger. The combination of the rating and the categorisation in the
   comments feeds a complex algorithm that ultimately generates the
   tellows-score, hence, indicating the trustworthiness of each number.
   However, the vast bulk of information on dangerous spam and scam
   numbers requires you and your willingness to share you experience and
   knowledge in order to help people and warn them before they suffer the
   inconvinience of being spammed and scammed.
