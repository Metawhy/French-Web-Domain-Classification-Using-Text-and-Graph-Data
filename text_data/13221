     “Typically, I was getting typecast as the bad boyfriend. The

     That was my bread and butter for a long time,” he says. “Looking

   He doesn’t look like an asshole now.

About

   I wanted a place to share my love of TV shows, movies, sports, books,
   and all things entertainment.
   The feeling of being transported to another time and place  never gets
   old for me. A good movie or book has the power to transform and leave
   one forever changed.  I don't beleive in high brow or low brow.  I
   believe in a good story.
