Case: TBS Mediabyrå

   (Self Service DSP)

About

   TBS Mediabyrå is a Swedish independent media agency offering strategic
   media consultation, analysis, planning and media purchasing in all
   digital and analogue channels. The agency handles brands of several
   industries, from real estate to FMCG.

Challenges

   Being an independent agency, TBS does not have access to the trading
   desk services of competing global agency networks. TBS needed to find a
   partner with strong local presence and support, that could help evolve
   and package programmatic solutions tailored to the needs of the agency.

Approach

   With BidTheatre DSP, TBS accesses a complete media buying and data
   management platform for all things programmatic. Our staff works daily
   with TBS media planners to provide technical support and campaign
   management.

Result

   Programmatic via BidTheatre is playing an increasingly important part
   in TBS digital toolbox.
     * Audience targeted campaigns are launched across a wide range of
       media, a previously unfeasible task
     * Historical figures, trends and learnings are all collected for
       reference in future campaigns
     * Performance and viewability are tracked closely
     * Banner and web-tv campaigns are executed across desktop and mobile

Case: Mittmedia Reacher

   (Enterprise API)

About

   Mittmedia is one of Sweden's biggest publishing houses, owning several
   daily newspapers, printing and commercial radio stations in mid-Sweden.

Challenges

   Mittmedia's challenge was to support both traditionally sold IO's and
   programmatic sales, the latter being increasingly preferred by digital
   advertising buyers. Facilitating this through traditional ad servers
   can be both complex, and non optimal in terms of yield. Another
   challenge was to leverage its local data assets and facilitating
   audience targeting.

Approach

   Mittmedia decided to fully replace it's traditional adserver setup with
   a fully programmatic setup, using an SSP to enable all demand
   (including internal), and BidTheatre's DSP to traffic campaigns from
   in-house sales. With the media buying engine made available through
   BidTheatre API's, Mittmedia choose to build its own user interface,
   tailored to the needs of its sales force.

Result

   In June 2016, Mittmedia unveiled "Reacher", it's new progressive and
   holistic platform for digital media sales. The follow objectives were
   achieved:
     * One system to traffic all campaigns, straightforward sales and
       traffic flow
     * Internal and external demand competing side by side, optimizing
       yield
     * Both banner- and video campaigns enabled
     * Possibility to extend campaigns with external
       non-Mittmedia inventory

Frantz

About

   Frantz A/S is a leading Norwegian media agency specialised in job
   advertisements. By data analysis and precision targeting, Frantz
   minimizes the cost per qualifed applicant. Its digital tool "Frantz
   Express" is used to efficiently produce quality job ads for both
   traditional and digital media. Clients are primarily from Norwegian
   state and regional sectors, but also from the other Scandinavian
   countries.

Challenges

   Frantz identified the need to own, control and refine its digital
   audience expertise, while integrating ad distribution into Frantz
   express.

Results

     * After an initial day of training at Frantz headquarters, 40+
       campaigns were successfully migrated into BidTheatre's DSP in less
       than two weeks. API integration with Frantz Express is currently
       ongoing.

   ABOUT BIDTHEATRE

   BidTheatre is a provider of data driven marketing software to media
   agencies, advertisers and publishers. With BidTheatre DSP, marketers
   get unified and efficient access to the fragmented European media
   landscape and can launch awareness building or conversion driving
   banner or video campaigns. With its capabilities to target and
   understand digital audiences, BidTheatre's platform makes marketing a
   dialogue, not a one-way communication.

   BIDTHEATRE AND PERSONAL DATA

   As an ad technology platform, BidTheatre may collect and process
   personal data for a few different purposes.

   Purpose 1: To record your visits to a website, or behaviour on a
   website, to perform targeting of ads.

   Legal Basis: Consent

   Example: Targeting ads based on your previous visit to a website, or
   previous purchase made at a website.

   Purpose 2: To record viewing of or interaction with an ad and combine
   this with records of advertiser website actions to attribute
   advertising effect.

   Legal Basis: Consent

   Example: Understanding that an advertisement was clicked and a
   subsequent purchase was made.

   Purpose 3: To combine records of personal data already collected about
   you to select relevant ads to show.

   Legal Basis: Legitimate interest. See section on profiling below.
   Please contact BidTheatre for details of our legitimate interest
   assessment.

   Example: Combining insights into your location, previously visited
   websites, and demographical data obtained from data suppliers to target
   an ad.

   Purpose 4: To transfer your randomly generated BidTheatre user ID to a
   third party for the purpose of receiving personal data from that third
   party.

   Legal Basis: Consent

   Purpose 5: To record the number of times you have viewed an ad, to
   prevent a single ad being shown too frequently.

   Legal Basis: Legitimate interest. Please contact BidTheatre for details
   of our legitimate interest assessment.

   BidTheatre is a registered Global Vendor in IAB Europe's Transparency &
   Consent Framework. Read more at http://advertisingconsent.eu.

   WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

   All personal data is automatically collected via requests sent over the
   Internet to our servers from third parties. These third parties are:

     * Advertisers (visits to their sites, purchases of
       products)
     * Supply Side Platforms (your geo location, browser, etc)
     * Data Suppliers (gender, age, income, interests, etc)
     * Other Technology Vendors (cross device resolution, etc)

   All personal data is attached to a personal unique identifying ID. By
   using the ID, personal data can be accessed, altered or removed. Given
   that legal basis exists, BidTheatre attempts to store the ID as a
   browser cookie to facilitate re-identification of a web browser over
   time.

   WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED & STORED?

   Information related to ads that you have been served are collected and
   stored. These include records of

     * Date, time, site and frequency of ad view (7 day retention)
     * Date, time and site where ad was clicked (180 day retention)

   In addition to these records, advertisers may collect information about
   activities made on their sites. These include

     * Actions made on their site following serving of an ad (180 day
       retention)
     * Visits to their sites to facilitate retargeting (180 day retention)

   In addition to personal data collected upon your interaction with ads
   or advertiser sites, BidTheatre may receive personal data from data
   suppliers. These are provided to facilitate targeting based on
   properties such as gender, age, income, interests and more.

   BidTheatre never collects or processes sensitive personal data or
   personal data such as name, address, social security number, medical
   records, vehicle records, credit records or anything else that allows
   for unique identification of an individual. No personal data is
   collected from public sources.

   WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED?

   In addition to the data stored, BidTheatre processes the following
   personal data to facilitate campaign targeting:

     * IP address (used to determine geo location, or perform organisation
       targeting)
     * User Agent (used to target ads based on user device type, operating
       system, or browser type)
     * Device Geo Location data (latitude / longitude)
     * Device ID’s (e.g. IDFA)

   This personal data is processed in realtime for ad selection purposes,
   and is not retained or recorded.

   IS PERSONAL DATA USED TO AUTOMATICALLY BUILD PROFILES?

   Collected personal data may be used to score your interest in certain
   content categories. Records of impressions, clicks, and actions on
   advertisers sites are used to build an interest score that will be
   retained for 60 days. We use the IAB Tier 1 Content taxonomy, available
   here: https://www.iab.com/guidelines/taxonomy/

   As a data subject, you have the right to object to profiling. This can
   be done by using our Privacy Tool.

   WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH?

   hosting partners. We and they do not transfer personal data outside of
   the EEA.

   Your personal data is not shared with any other party. Your personal
   data is not shared with advertisers or other users of the BidTheatre
   DSP.

   exchange your unique user ID with these third parties provided that we
   have received your consent:

     * Media & Data Supply vendors
     * Cross Device technology vendor
     * Fraud Detection technology vendor

   We require these third parties to comply with similar and equally
   stringent undertakings of privacy and confidentiality as BidTheatre
   does.

   DO WE USE COOKIES TO COLLECT PERSONAL DATA?

   personal data recorded for it. The cookie is stored with a maximum age
   of 7 to 90 days depending on purpose.

   Read more about BidTheatre and cookies in our Cookie Policy.

   YOUR RIGHTS AS A DATA SUBJECT / PRIVACY TOOL

   BidTheatre's Privacy Tool is the preferred way of accessing your
   personal data in the BidTheatre DSP. The tool facilitates the
   possibility for you to exercise a number of your user rights in terms
   of personal data:

    1. The right to object to processing - You have the right to object to
       certain types of processing, including processing for direct
       marketing (i.e. if you no longer want to be contacted with
       potential opportunities).
    2. The right to be informed - You have the right to be provided with
       clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how
       we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re
       providing you with the information in this Policy.
    3. The right of access - You have the right to obtain access to your
       information (if we’re processing it), and certain other information
       (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so
       you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in
       accordance with data protection law.
    4. The right to erasure - This is also known as ‘the right to be
       forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the
       deletion or removal of your information where there’s no compelling
       reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to
       erasure; there are exceptions.
    5. The right to rectification - You are entitled to have your
       information corrected if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
    6. The right to restrict further processing - You have rights to
       ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When
       processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but
       may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for
       further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the
       restriction is respected in future.
    7. The right to data portability - You have rights to obtain and reuse
       your personal information for your own purposes across different
       services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider,
       this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily
       between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without
       affecting its usability.

   HOW CAN YOU ENSURE THAT NO PERSONAL DATA IS STORED?

   BidTheatre inspects three settings to determine whether user data can
   be stored

    1. BidTheatre respects the Do Not Track (DNT) initiative, please
       consult your browser settings for details on how to enable DNT in
       your browser.
    2. BidTheatre inspects your user ID for an suppression / consent
       setting. To suppress personal data collection or use, or revoke
       consent, access the Privacy Tool here.
    3. Upon analysing opportunities to purchase ad space to target ads to
       our end users, we inspect and respect Internet Advertising Bureau
       (IAB) industry standard signals for end-user consent. You may alter
       these signals by giving or revoking your consent at publishers that
       have implemented consent collection and adhere to IAB standards.

   CONSEQUENCE OF NOT PROVIDING PERSONAL DATA

   The consequence of objecting or restricting processing and/or
   withdrawing consent is that no we will be able to make less informed or
   precise automated decisions about what ads to show to you. As a data
   subject, you have the right to make a complaint to the Swedish data
   protection authority Datainspektionen.

Case: TBS Mediabyrå

   (Self Service DSP)

About

   TBS Mediabyrå is a Swedish independent media agency offering strategic
   media consultation, analysis, planning and media purchasing in all
   digital and analogue channels. The agency handles brands of several
   industries, from real estate to FMCG.

Challenges

   Being an independent agency, TBS does not have access to the trading
   desk services of competing global agency networks. TBS needed to find a
   partner with strong local presence and support, that could help evolve
   and package programmatic solutions tailored to the needs of the agency.

Approach

   With BidTheatre DSP, TBS accesses a complete media buying and data
   management platform for all things programmatic. Our staff works daily
   with TBS media planners to provide technical support and campaign
   management.

Result

   Programmatic via BidTheatre is playing an increasingly important part
   in TBS digital toolbox.
     * Audience targeted campaigns are launched across a wide range of
       media, a previously unfeasible task
     * Historical figures, trends and learnings are all collected for
       reference in future campaigns
     * Performance and viewability are tracked closely
     * Banner and web-tv campaigns are executed across desktop and mobile

Case: Mittmedia Reacher

   (Enterprise API)

About

   Mittmedia is one of Sweden's biggest publishing houses, owning several
   daily newspapers, printing and commercial radio stations in mid-Sweden.

Challenges

   Mittmedia's challenge was to support both traditionally sold IO's and
   programmatic sales, the latter being increasingly preferred by digital
   advertising buyers. Facilitating this through traditional ad servers
   can be both complex, and non optimal in terms of yield. Another
   challenge was to leverage its local data assets and facilitating
   audience targeting.

Approach

   Mittmedia decided to fully replace it's traditional adserver setup with
   a fully programmatic setup, using an SSP to enable all demand
   (including internal), and BidTheatre's DSP to traffic campaigns from
   in-house sales. With the media buying engine made available through
   BidTheatre API's, Mittmedia choose to build its own user interface,
   tailored to the needs of its sales force.

Result

   In June 2016, Mittmedia unveiled "Reacher", it's new progressive and
   holistic platform for digital media sales. The follow objectives were
   achieved:
     * One system to traffic all campaigns, straightforward sales and
       traffic flow
     * Internal and external demand competing side by side, optimizing
       yield
     * Both banner- and video campaigns enabled
     * Possibility to extend campaigns with external
       non-Mittmedia inventory

Frantz

About

   Frantz A/S is a leading Norwegian media agency specialised in job
   advertisements. By data analysis and precision targeting, Frantz
   minimizes the cost per qualifed applicant. Its digital tool "Frantz
   Express" is used to efficiently produce quality job ads for both
   traditional and digital media. Clients are primarily from Norwegian
   state and regional sectors, but also from the other Scandinavian

Challenges

   Frantz identified the need to own, control and refine its digital
   audience expertise, while integrating ad distribution into Frantz
   express.

Results

     * After an initial day of training at Frantz headquarters, 40+
       campaigns were successfully migrated into BidTheatre's DSP in less
       than two weeks. API integration with Frantz Express is currently
       ongoing.
