   "We are Proud of who we are, without shame"
   The duality of our heritage is a blessing by our Creator. Not made
   souly by the hand of our ancestors but by the crafting from the Hand of
   God. You may not understand this but we do. The Native heritage is an
   awesome atribute from our Creator to teach man how to respect mother
   earth whom the Creator made with His very own Powerful Hands.  We are
   the caretakers of this land.

   “Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the
   original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there
   were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred
   had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century
   forward, blood flowed in battles of racial supremacy. We are perhaps
   the
   only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its
   Indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience
   into
   a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to
   reject or feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our
   films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.”
   Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

   BlackIndians.com and the Binay Tribe  where the first ones to endure
   the insults attackes and rejections about being Black Indian. We were

   native Americans. We continue to be strong and leaders in educating
   people that we are hear and our ancestors live on. We are Binay. We are
   BlackIndians. Both Red and Black. We are the Red and Black Native

   Beautiful Black Indian People
   Why is it that when someone is mixed with Spanish, or mixed with White,
   Or mixed with Greek or Italian he doesn't have to explain him or
   herself, why is it that when you say your mixed Black and Red you have
   to explain and there is doubt in peoples mind? My dad is full Native
   and my mother was Mixed Native. But I came out looking all Black. But
   I'm half re and half black.
   I am a BlackIndian and I'm proud to be.
   What about you?

   What do you call a Child who has been born to a Red and Black Person?
   What do you call a Child whos Father is Native American And Whos Mother
   is Black?
   A BlackIndian.
   Even after WWI and WWII many Natives did not go back to Indian
   reservations. They met other people and many married Black People and
   had children. My ancestors did just that. I am a Black Indian.

   101 Tips for Landing Native American Scholarships and Grants for
   College

   There are many " Black Indians In America" some nearly full blooded
   Native, some as little as 1%. That means one of their ancestors were
   full blood. It was believed by many tribes that if you had one drop of
   Indian blood then you were Indian. We belive the same way. Though we
   are not owned by the United States Government like many other tribes,
   we still know who we are and we also honor our native ancestry. If you
   feel the same way that we do then join us and honoring your ancestry.
   We are Binay, Yeha Noha The Strong Stone people. We will not be moved.
   And we will not be removed.
   Ashoge!
   Chief Jerry Eaglefeather

   PS. We do not want to be Indian. We do not claim to be full blooded
   Indians. One thing for sure is that we are not wannabees, Lord knows
   there are many out there today. If we where claiming to only be Indian
   we wouldn't have the word Black attached to our name.
   We honor both our Native "Red" and our African "Black" Ancestry.
   Something that is not common in American history.
   But since our Creator chose to create us this way. Then we honor both
   our ancestry. Please respect us that we walk our own way with our
   Creator. There is no need to be afraid that we want your heritage or
   culture. We walk the path of the Sacred Road book. The Path of our
   Creator Usen.
   Ashoge.
