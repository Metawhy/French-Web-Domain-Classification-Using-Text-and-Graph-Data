Aftermath: Giving Bad News, Functional Language

   [aftermath.jpg]
   This is very good movie, but this scene is very sad. Watch it
   beforehand and check if it is suitable for the moment and the students.
   It is an effective task, my students liked it, but they felt really
   sorry for the main character.
   There are different ways to give  bad news. Read the ways you can give
   bad news.
     * I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you...
     * I'm sorry I've got a bit of bad news to tell you..
     * I really don’t know how to say it, but …
     * I’m sorry to have to say this, but …
     * I really feel bad to have to say this, but …

   Watch the segment and check the way the bad news was given. Finally,
   talk to a partner, take the roles of the characters and give the bad
   news and react to it yourselves.

    Group discussion:
    1. How effective was the way he was given the bad news? Is there a
   better way to give such bad news?
    2. Would you do it differently?

     * You have to tell your best friend you can’t come to his/her wedding
     * You are the president of a company and you have to announce
       reduction of costs, so he will have to dismiss employees
     * You have to tell a customer that you cannot fix his computer hard

The Great Wall & Baraka: Both...

   [the%2Bgreat%2Bwall.jpg]
   [baraka.jpg]
   [adults.png]
   [INTERMEDIATE.png]
   Talk to partner. Can you explain the difference between a Ritual and a
   Tradition?
   Share your guesses with the class.
   Read the paragraphs about tradition and ritual.
   • Tradition is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of things
   and concepts that are handed down by one generation to another. A
   tradition is an act, behavior, or a belief system which has a special
   significance for the members of the society.
   • Ritual is an act or a series of acts that are performed or observed
   in a society. In every society, important functions, events,
   ceremonies, festivals  are marked by certain acts or a series of acts
   that are perceived to have a symbolic value. Rituals are observed
   almost religiously because, in most cases, they have a religious
   backing and, therefore, considered important for individuals in the
   society. It is the presence of rituals that make an event formal and
   traditional.
   According to the definitions above, decide which situations are rituals
   and traditions.
    1. a handshake to greet others
    2. the practice to honor and respect the seniors
    3. exchanging wedding rings on the alter
    4. bride's wearing white on the wedding day

   Traditions
   2, 4
   Rituals
   1, 3
   Watch the movie segment from the movie The Great Wall and make a list
   of  acts involved in the rituals of the scene. Can you see any
   traditions? Have in mind the acts, clothes, feelings, etc.

   WmnMi0xJLzQxAghu_rwV4-7-6b0ZpR7Ud35t


   Remember:
   Both
   Both means 'this one and that one', 'these two together', 'at the same
   time' (it always precedes two elements):
   Ex: Both my parents are from Brazil. My mother is from Salvador and so
   is my father.
   Ex: Burger King sells both burgers and fries. Burg sells burgers and
   also fries.
   Both can also be used as a pronoun:
   Ex: Both of them work near their homes. Those two people work near
   their homes.
   Ex: I saw two shirts in the store and I bought them both.
   I saw two shirts in the store and I bought the two of them.

A little about myself

   Claudio Azevedo
          Brasilia, DF, Brazil
          I'm a teacher at Casa Thomas Jefferson, Brasilia, Brazil. I'm a
          Branch Coordinator and Teacher Trainer as well. I really like
          movies and seeing them with "different" eyes, trying to see how
          I can use them in my classroom. Recently, I have dedicated my
          ideas to grammar activities with movie segments because,
          apparently, teachers use movies for many purposes, but grammar.
          Working with movie segments fosters students' production and
          interest. I truly believe that grammar exercises should be
          attractive. I have just developed a new blog for movie segments
          to enhance topic based classes, focusing on conversation,
          listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. If you have
          suggestions for the blogs and the activities, just say it!

A little about myself

   My photo

   Claudio Azevedo
          Brasilia, DF, Brazil
          I'm a teacher at Casa Thomas Jefferson, Brasilia, Brazil. I'm a
          Branch Coordinator and Teacher Trainer as well. I really like
          movies and seeing them with "different" eyes, trying to see how
          I can use them in my classroom. Recently, I have dedicated my
          ideas to grammar activities with movie segments because,
          apparently, teachers use movies for many purposes, but grammar.
          Working with movie segments fosters students' production and
          interest. I truly believe that grammar exercises should be
          attractive. I have just developed a new blog for movie segments
          to enhance topic based classes, focusing on conversation,
          listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. If you have
          suggestions for the blogs and the activities, just say it!

A little about myself

   My photo

   Claudio Azevedo
          Brasilia, DF, Brazil
          I'm a teacher at Casa Thomas Jefferson, Brasilia, Brazil. I'm a
          Branch Coordinator and Teacher Trainer as well. I really like
          movies and seeing them with "different" eyes, trying to see how
          I can use them in my classroom. Recently, I have dedicated my
          ideas to grammar activities with movie segments because,
          apparently, teachers use movies for many purposes, but grammar.
          Working with movie segments fosters students' production and
          interest. I truly believe that grammar exercises should be
          attractive. I have just developed a new blog for movie segments
          to enhance topic based classes, focusing on conversation,
          listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. If you have
          suggestions for the blogs and the activities, just say it!

Aftermath: Giving Bad News, Functional Language

   [aftermath.jpg]
   This is very good movie, but this scene is very sad. Watch it
   beforehand and check if it is suitable for the moment and the students.
   It is an effective task, my students liked it, but they felt really
   sorry for the main character.
   There are different ways to give  bad news. Read the ways you can give
   bad news.
     * I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you...
     * I'm sorry I've got a bit of bad news to tell you..
     * I really don’t know how to say it, but …
     * I’m sorry to have to say this, but …
     * I really feel bad to have to say this, but …

   Watch the segment and check the way the bad news was given. Finally,
   talk to a partner, take the roles of the characters and give the bad
   news and react to it yourselves.

   WOxnyNj1Ww3jOgKr5z_3SOdZ0xx-LmQnvkLg

    Group discussion:
    1. How effective was the way he was given the bad news? Is there a
   better way to give such bad news?
    2. Would you do it differently?
   Role Play -
   Giving and reacting to the bad news:
     * You have to tell your best friend you can’t come to his/her wedding
     * You are the president of a company and you have to announce
       reduction of costs, so he will have to dismiss employees
     * You have to tell a customer that you cannot fix his computer hard
       drive and everything will be lost
     * You have to tell your mom and dad that you can't spend Christmas
       with them
     * You have to tell your friend that you crashed the car he had lent
       you to go on  a date
     * You are a teacher and you have to tell your student that he failed
       the course despite of all his effort.

A little about myself

   My photo

   Claudio Azevedo
          Brasilia, DF, Brazil
          I'm a teacher at Casa Thomas Jefferson, Brasilia, Brazil. I'm a
          Branch Coordinator and Teacher Trainer as well. I really like
          movies and seeing them with "different" eyes, trying to see how
          I can use them in my classroom. Recently, I have dedicated my
          ideas to grammar activities with movie segments because,
          apparently, teachers use movies for many purposes, but grammar.
          Working with movie segments fosters students' production and
          interest. I truly believe that grammar exercises should be
          attractive. I have just developed a new blog for movie segments
          to enhance topic based classes, focusing on conversation,
          listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. If you have
          suggestions for the blogs and the activities, just say it!

A little about myself

   Claudio Azevedo
          Brasilia, DF, Brazil
          I'm a teacher at Casa Thomas Jefferson, Brasilia, Brazil. I'm a
          Branch Coordinator and Teacher Trainer as well. I really like
          movies and seeing them with "different" eyes, trying to see how
          I can use them in my classroom. Recently, I have dedicated my
          ideas to grammar activities with movie segments because,
          apparently, teachers use movies for many purposes, but grammar.
          Working with movie segments fosters students' production and
          interest. I truly believe that grammar exercises should be
          attractive. I have just developed a new blog for movie segments
          to enhance topic based classes, focusing on conversation,
          listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. If you have
          suggestions for the blogs and the activities, just say it!
