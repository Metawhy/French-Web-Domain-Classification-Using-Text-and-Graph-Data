   Wild Foodism is a movement embracing the answer to the timeless
   question: What is our natural diet?

   Beyond paleo, beyond raw food, and beyond vegetarianism, Wild Foodism
   is not just another diet with a different combination of the same
   domesticated foods, but rather a lifestyle that is inherently optimal
   to the Homo sapiens species.

   This website is not meant to serve as an extensive identification guide
   for the various flora and fauna of our ecosystem.

   Instead, its mission is to spread an awareness and adoption of nature’s
   most natural food into our current consciousness to enhance our health,
   longevity, and survival as a species.

       Do you ever receive pictures if mushrooms and identify them. I
       found a really good size one growing above my treestand. Would
       really like to find out what it is. I have watched numerous of your
       videos . And very time I watch one I can’t help but think how much
       fun it would be to take a walk in the tembers with you. You seem so
       down to earth and a all around cool guy.

       Adam thanks for posting the info. I’m a retired Hydro One
       provincial forester and have spent many years working on and with
       trees, so find the mushroom info informative. I’ve seen Chaga
       Mushrooms many times while in the bush but up until this past
       December I had no idea what it was or its benefits. I have been
       battling a couple different types of cancer by taking RM10 which is
       10 different medicinal mushrooms now for about eight years and now
       have added the chaga which I can find quite easily here in the
       hardwood bush lots of Ontario and have had enough to even sell some
       to the local organic farm for resale. A few of my friends have also
       started taking the chaga tea and have seen how beneficial it has
       been to keep them from getting sick also.
       Keep up the great work Adam. I have had two of my Doctors tell me
       that they believe the next major breakthrough in Cancer research
       will be from mushrooms and I certainly agree and can testify to
       what I have experienced in my own battle with this killer. They
       told me I would be dead about four years ago by now but I know God
       showed me what I could do to help myself.

            Hi Latania,
            Thanks for the message. Can you please send me an email so
            that I have your email address? The medicinal mushroom guide
            is an e-book, and so I will send it to you electronically.
            Here is my email: adam@learnyourland.com
            Regarding the August 27th hike, there will not be a bus that
            leaves the city, though if you’re looking to carpool with
            someone, let me know and perhaps I can arrange that for you.
            Thanks!

       Now I have them growing all around the base. Really great info that
       you have about it on your site. I just need to convince my wife now
       that they are safe to eat.

       Thanks for the quick reply. .. I plan inoculating a few of my older
       Oak trees that have been damaged by Storms & probably won’t survive
       more than a couple more years .. It’s helpful to know that
       inoculating healthy trees COULD harm them , so that won’t happen.
       Thanks again for your timely & informative information

       Hi Adam, I have enjoyed reading the information on your website,
       very informative. I have been introduced to the health benefits of
       chaga and have been given a small quantity to try. Now I am
       interested in finding some myself. I recently took a walk on my
       land and spotted these on a very old birch tree. Is this chaga?
       What is the best way to send photos?

            Cheryl if what you found looks like a mushroom its not Chaga.
            Chaga just looks like a solid black crumble chunk of coal.
            When you break it off it will be golden brown underneath.
            Hope this helps.

            Adam I have been tapping sugar maples now for about 20 years
            and over the past few years have been experimenting with
            trying to help the trees to heal faster after tapping. Trees
            that I have tapped four or five years ago and didn’t do
            anything with are still showing the hole where they were
            drilled while others that I tapped in a 1 inch length of
            doweling in less than 2 years have completely healed over the
            spot with new bark. I match the drill bit size to the hardwood
            doweling and tap it in so that it is just slightly beyond
            flush so that you can just start to see the lighter colored
            inner bark. The little bit of sap that is still dripping out,
            swells the dry doweling and plugs the hole nicely but more
            importantly gives the bark something to attach to and heal
            over many years faster than if you didn’t. They are healing
            over so nicely that it makes it difficult to even find the
            location so you can avoid it when I tap the next time. I
            believe if I were to cut down the tree and open up this
            section that has been plugged that you could see that the tree
            hasn’t turned black here from it shutting down sap flow to
            this injured section and simply has just grown around the plug
            and sealed itself over with the new bark. So far this
            experiment has been very promising and thought others would
            like to know about this as well.
            I use a belt sander to slightly tapper the end of the dowel I
            tap in the hole and put them in right away as I pull the
            spiels. One year I tried to use slightly larger dowels and
            they actually split the tree a little so try and match the
            dowel to the right size of hole and tap it into the depth I
            mentioned and just see how fast it will heal over. I am a
            provincial forester and spent my life working with trees and
            they are truly a passion of mine. I would be happy to pass on
            any more info to anyone if they have questions about this.
            Keep up the great work Adam. I’m 61 now but still learning
            more about trees.
            Thanks Randy

       What a pleasure to see your enthusiasm. Last year I followed Dave
       Cantabury another naturalist from the Ohio area. I live in central
       Ontario Canada and the plant life in our area is similar to yours,
       what I’m interested in is if you know of, or have any connection or
       contact information of a naturalist or possibly a local
       organization or group in the Peterborough area

       in your store.
       Are you out? When will you make more?
       Do you use turpentine in wound treatment? Edgar Cayce recommends it
       highly.
       Have a great day.
