ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI) is the flagship
journal of the Computer-Human Interaction community — and a premier journal
in all of human-computer interaction.

   TOCHI publishes scientific work of the highest caliber and has done so
   since our inaugural issue in March of 1994. Our papers contribute
   analyses of the human impacts of technology, deliver deep insights into
   the latest innovations in interaction design, and reshape how we (as a
   broad and diverse research community) think about the technologies
   that influence people’s everyday lives.

   As such TOCHI is inherently multi-disciplinary, as well as
   inter-disciplinary, and we therefore welcome contributions that
   straddle or combine insights from multiple fields.

   TOCHI emphasizes important and broadly applicable results. Those
   results might take the form of reflections on a significant research
   system. They could be well-justified and well-motivated designs of new
   technologies and techniques. Or they may manifest as careful
   quantitative studies of people and the artifacts they use. In practice
   strong TOCHI contributions are often integrative analyses that embody
   some combination of all of these, and thereby contribute to both the
   theory and the practice of human-computer interaction.

   The journal also considers original work focused on specific domains,
   particular requirements of diverse end-users, and ethical issues that
   influence the design of computing systems and technologies — so long as
   they are framed in a way that makes them relevant and interesting to a
   general readership of human-computer interaction specialists.

   In other words, TOCHI embraces results that span the full range of
   design, technological development, and user experience that make the
   CHI field as vibrant as it is.

HCI and the Body: Reimagining Women’s Health

A Special Issue of ACM Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction (ToCHI)

   Deadline for Abstract Submissions: April 5th, 2019

   In the HCI community we have seen an increasing exploration of
   technology in relation to the female body and women’s health. Much of
   this work had explored the role that technology can play in supporting
   transitions to, and experiences of motherhood. Such a focus reflects
   the wider approach of commercial technologies to the female body – that
   related to reproductive health. In the last five years research focus
   in relation to women’s health has broadened, entering into more
   intimate, taboo, and politically charged topics. This has included the
   design and evaluation of tools for enabling intimate anatomical
   knowledge, through to explorations of digital approaches to advocating
   for changes in policy relating to women’s health issues (from topics
   such as breastfeeding, parental leave through to abortion rights).
   These advances in the multiple experiences, voices and concerns of the
   female body and women’s health not only trouble the kinds of methods we
   have available for doing design and for evaluating our design work, but
   also define and redefine the limits of the technologies and
   interactions we create. So much of women’s health involves concern
   about parts of the body and topics which are normally highly personal,
   off-limits. The placement and uses of digital materials and
   technologies may be orientated or inserted in relation to the body in
   ways which the HCI community has rarely explored. Questions remain
   about how we as a community can best approach the body and women’s
   health in ways which are appropriate, inclusive, while also
   contributing to the improvement of women’s health experiences at a
   global level. We ask also how such new possibilities can be deployed,
   the risks of these deployments, as well as the means by which these
   interactions can be evaluated not just at an individual level, but also
   at the socio-cultural and political levels which are widely understood
   as constructing and limiting women’s health experiences.

Information for Contributors

   This special issue aims to provide an inclusive perspective,
   acknowledging that biology alone does not dictate gender, and that the
   female experience is more than menstruation, pregnancy and motherhood.
   We wish to highlight the ways in which the digital intersects with the
   female experience, roadmap opportunities for digital technologies
   within women’s health, as well as provide critical and speculative
   perspectives on what technology means and could mean within this
   context.

   Articles might contribute to this special issue in the following ways:
     * Scoping reviews and evaluations of existing women’s health
       technologies (including for example the self-sampling for HPV,
       menstrual tracking applications, technologies for sexual wellbeing,
       menopause awareness and management, etc.)
     * Ethnographies and/or interaction criticism that unpack women’s
       health experiences and digital re-presentations of the female body
     * Theoretical revisitations of the relationships between the body and
       digital technologies scoped to women’s health
     * Applications and designs (including critical and speculative) which
       respond to a full spectrum of women’s health experiences
     * Activism, advocacy and/or more general politics associated with
       worldwide access and experiences of women’s health
     * Design methods and processes which engage with, respond to, and
       reimagine the body in women’s health

   We will use a standard journal review process for this special issue,
   with two rounds of reviews and revisions. Authors are encouraged to
   submit a short abstract (300-500 words) and a tentative title prior to
   the full paper submission to be reviewed by the special issue editors.

ToCHI Best Paper Award 2017

   ACM TOCHI is happy to announce the 2017 best paper award winner:
   “Motion Correlation: Selecting Objects by Matching their Movement” by
   authors Velloso, Carter, Newn, Esteves, Clarke and Gellersen.

   Using eye gaze and gestures to interact with interfaces is gaining
   traction. Here we are shown important lessons learnt in how to design,
   implement and evaluate the use of eye gaze to select objects on a
   screen — be it a smartwatch screen, a large wall-mounted screen or
   selecting Internet of Things objects in our surroundings. The principle
   is to represent available objects by motion in the interface, have
   users identify a target by mimicking its specific motion, and use the
   correlation between the system’s output with the user’s input to
   determine the selection. The work is firmly based in a thorough
   understanding of human perception, explored in a range of different
   systems, arriving at a set of design principles and generalisable
   concepts.

Call for Papers: Special Issue on Human-Building Interaction


Call for Papers

Human-Building Interaction

A Special Issue of ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM TOCHI)

Deadline for Submissions: (be sure to see also our author’s instructions)

     * December 8, 2017: Informal submission of abstract to special issue
       editors at HBI-TOCHI@unifr.ch.

   Submission of an abstract is not required, but very strongly
   recommended for prospective special issue authors.
     * January 12, 2018: Submit Full Manuscript at
       http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tochi.


Information for Contributors

   We seek original contributions for a new Special Issue of TOCHI on
   Human-Building Interaction.

   Built environments increasingly incorporate interactivity and
   context-aware automation. Human-Building Interaction (HBI), as an
   emerging research field, seeks to develop an HCI lens to the vision of
   our interactive experiences with built environments.

   A special issue of TOCHI on Human-Building Interaction invites research
   contributions that examine the engagement of HCI in the evolution of
   buildings and urban spaces.

   In particular, we solicit articles that pursue the new coordinates that
   HCI should take into account when shifting attention and scale from
   “artefact” to “environment.” For example, the investigations on the
   occupant comfort across multiple dimensions (e.g., thermal, visual,
   acoustic, respiratory), the discussions of the interplay between user
   agency and building automation, the reflections on the immersive and
   durable user experience design, and so forth.

   We seek contributions that address these and similar topics that embody
   the complexity of human’s individual and collective experiences with
   and within the built environment. The invited topics include
   technological innovations, ethnographic studies, as well as conceptual
   and framing contributions.

   Between the lofty and mundane discourses of interactive architecture
   and connected products lies considerable space for grounded research
   and reflective discussion.

   This special issue invites attempts to capture, share, and expand what
   is already known, what is contested, and what are opportunities for a
   common scientific grounding for prospective dialogues and discourses in
   the area of Human-Building Interaction. It will serve both as a
   unifying stage for the existing voices that are centrally and
   peripherally working on HBI, and a platform for the research area to
   move forward.


   The HBI special issue is interested in questions including (but not
   limited to) the following:
     * How can HBI designers reconcile the complexity of human decisions
       with the efficiency that the automation systems promise? What
       services do we expect the building to provide seamlessly, and where
       do we want to retain the manipulation control, and through what
       interaction modalities?
     * What are the UX design challenges in creating buildings that can
       adapt to their occupants’ contextualized needs and preferences?
     * Surveillance is increasingly common to provide security. How does
       the need for surveillance interplay with the privacy concerns which
       are especially elevated in inhabited environments?
     * What can we learn from the comfort literature in the scholarly
       domain of architecture, and how can an HCI perspective complement
       and (possibly) correct the current comfort discourses?
     * In what ways can built environments support and take advantage of
       social and cultural diversity?
     * Are architecture and interaction design methods and processes
       compatible? Concretely, how can a team of interaction designers
       bring their tools to an architectural project?

And We Award the Inaugural TOCHI Best Paper Award, 2016, to…

     __________________________________________________________________


   We interrupt your regularly scheduled blog posts for a special message
   from TOCHI’s Editor-in-Chief, Ken Hinckley, who shares with us some
   breaking news…
     __________________________________________________________________


   Banner for ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction Best Paper
   Award, 2016

   And yes—thank you, because indeed a very special moment in the history
   of the TOCHI journal has arrived, and herein we unveil the inaugural…


ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction

Best Paper Award

— 2016 —

   So sit back, grab some popcorn (and perhaps a beverage of your
   choosing), and enjoy the festivities.


   With the Full Red Carpet Treatment. Of course, on such a celebratory
   occasion, we must roll out a luxuriant red promenade.

   For a fleeting moment, we even considered a military parade for this
   inaugural occasion. But budgets being what they are, the best we could
   afford turned out to be a brigade of “Reviewer 2’s” armed with sharp
   red pens. To be brutally honest we feared this would not go over well,
   to say the least, and so all such plans were scrapped forthwith.

   And with the reality of the publishing industry (as of early 2017)
   being what it is, our “red” carpet, I am afraid, must be printed solely
   in black and white.

   Furthermore, rather than a plush walkway, the substrate upon which we
   must strut our stuff is much more akin to recycled newsprint.

   But what a venue it is!

   Okay, enough fun for now.

   So let me set the stage for the award, and in so doing, switch to what
   my wife calls, my serious voice…
     __________________________________________________________________

   Because it takes incredibly hard work to get into TOCHI, and many
   notable HCI researchers have published their work in our pages. Even
   more important, I think, is the wave of up-and-comers in the field who
   are constantly breaking new ground. We are honored to have played a
   small role in building their careers, and publication credentials, as
   well.

   TOCHI plays a vital role in the HCI community because it offers a forum
   for results that sprawl beyond the tidy boxes, tied up with neat satin
   bows, that can sometimes come to dominate typical conference papers.
   I’ve certainly written my fair share of those (only without the
   neatness, and often with some loose ends in those bows as well…). And
   of course there is nothing wrong with the “typical” conference-paper
   type of contribution, but by the same token it’s really important that
   the field has venues for results that are “out of the box” in a
   sense—and indeed, that span multiple boxes in the form of
   cross-discipline work, as well.

   In that regard, the article we’ve selected for our 2016 Best Paper
   award is a great representative of the field. It reports on an
   interdisciplinary effort that advances the needs of a particular user
   community, but in so doing pushes on boundaries of interaction design
   and computer science as well. In order to build the system the authors
   embarked upon, the research had to upend some conventional wisdom
   regarding image navigation and innovate new interaction techniques
   along the way.

   So (drum roll please), without further ado…


   The recipient of the 2016 TOCHI Best Paper Award is:


The Design and Evaluation of

Interfaces for Navigating Gigapixel Images

   following:

     Plaque for the inaugural TOCHI Best Paper Award, 2016

   And just to pique your interest in this fine work just a bit further,
   the following abstract characterizes the work in the authors’ own
   words:

      This article describes the design and evaluation of two generations
     of an interface for navigating datasets of gigapixel images that
     pathologists use to diagnose cancer.

     The interface design is innovative because users panned with an
     overview:detail view scale difference that was up to 57 times larger
     than established guidelines, and 1 million pixel “thumbnail”
     overviews that leveraged the real estate of high-resolution
     workstation displays.

     The research involved experts performing real work (pathologists
     diagnosing cancer), using datasets that were up to 3,150 times
     larger than those used in previous studies that involved navigating
     images. The evaluation provides evidence about the effectiveness of
     the interfaces and characterizes how experts navigate gigapixel
     images when performing real work. Similar interfaces could be
     adopted in applications that use other types of high-resolution
     images (e.g., remote sensing or high-throughput microscopy).

   Check it out. You’ll be glad you did. By the time you read this, the
   article should be available in the ACM Digital Library for
   open-access—sporting a spiffy new award badge no less—at:

TOCHI Article Alert: Fall Prevention for Older Adults: Qualitative Results
from a Long-Term Field Study

   Falls are one of the chief causes of serious injury among older adults,
   often ultimately resulting in reduced quality of life and a transition
   away from independent living.

   This work deploys a sensing system with an interesting set of exergames
   aimed at early intervention through improved physical fitness and
   regular assessment of the risk of falls. While many challenges were
   encountered in deploying the system, and the user population was
   necessarily limited to relatively able-bodied individuals due to
   ethical and safety concerns, a six-month deployment with older adults
   in their homes as well as in community-dwelling situations showed great
   promise in empowering individuals to monitor and control their own
   fitness, health, and fall risk. Making this an enjoyable and
   entertaining activity that older adults can weave into their daily
   routines could be instrumental in effecting long-term use with
   sustainable health benefits.

TOCHI Article Alert: Applying the Norman 1986 User-Centered Model to
Post-WIMP UIs

   This work takes Norman’s classic notion of ‘cognitive engineering’ and
   updates it to the modern context of touch-based and tangible
   interfaces.

   As the authors demonstrate for the particular case of a 3D object
   rotation task, Norman’s model still has a great deal of explanatory
   power for such a task and may continue to give insights into
   interaction methods and techniques that barely existed as research
   prototypes when his work was first conceived.

   If indeed human beings think with their hands every bit as much (and
   perhaps even more so) than they do abstractly with reason, then perhaps
   in this era of the post-WIMP (Windows-Icons-Menus-Pointers) interface
   our tools for thought have come very far indeed.

TOCHI Article Alert: Investigating Expressive Tactile Interaction Design in
Artistic Graphical Representations

   This article is a wonderful example of something that unfortunately we
   don’t see come through our submissions queue as often as I would like:
   namely, a design-research-centric TOCHI contribution.

   In particular, this article explores how tactile feedback can be
   employed in a multisensory context to augment works of visual art.
   Here, the focus is not on metrics such as bandwidth and speed-accuracy
   tradeoffs—as are traditional concerns in the use of tactile feedback to
   augment pointing devices (for example)—but rather largely unexplored
   questions of expressiveness and new interaction potentials rise to the
   fore. The result, in addition to a richly illustrated contribution, is
   a set of affordances for expressive visuotactile interactions, as well
   as an intriguing design space for tactile augmentation that points the
   way to new user experiences.

   (http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2957756).

TOCHI Article Alert: HCI for Reconciling Everyday Food and Sustainability

   This article is a moving example of how HCI has the potential to tackle
   some of the biggest problems facing the globe by framing these
   challenges as socio-technical design problems that must be met at the
   social, cultural, individual, and yes, technological levels.

   At present most people’s food practices are mundane and often routine,
   but as particularly the ‘food pioneers’ probed by this study
   demonstrate, there are ample insights to be gained from existing
   practices that could inform the ‘user experience’ of obtaining and
   preparing sustainable food. And indeed, what ‘sustainable food’ itself
   entails is a complex interplay of ideas and concerns about what we eat
   and where it comes from. This is a complex design problem that
   encompasses everything from the in-store experience, packaging design,
   on-line shopping, social and family pressures, and awareness of the
   provenance of food, to name just a few issues unpacked by this
   far-ranging investigation.

ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI) is the flagship
journal of the Computer-Human Interaction community — and a premier journal
in all of human-computer interaction.

   TOCHI publishes scientific work of the highest caliber and has done so
   since our inaugural issue in March of 1994. Our papers contribute
   analyses of the human impacts of technology, deliver deep insights into
   the latest innovations in interaction design, and reshape how we (as a
   broad and diverse research community) think about the technologies
   that influence people’s everyday lives.

   As such TOCHI is inherently multi-disciplinary, as well as
   inter-disciplinary, and we therefore welcome contributions that
   straddle or combine insights from multiple fields.

   TOCHI emphasizes important and broadly applicable results. Those
   results might take the form of reflections on a significant research
   system. They could be well-justified and well-motivated designs of new
   technologies and techniques. Or they may manifest as careful
   quantitative studies of people and the artifacts they use. In practice
   strong TOCHI contributions are often integrative analyses that embody
   some combination of all of these, and thereby contribute to both the
   theory and the practice of human-computer interaction.

   The journal also considers original work focused on specific domains,
   particular requirements of diverse end-users, and ethical issues that
   influence the design of computing systems and technologies — so long as
   they are framed in a way that makes them relevant and interesting to a
   general readership of human-computer interaction specialists.

   In other words, TOCHI embraces results that span the full range of
   design, technological development, and user experience that make the
   CHI field as vibrant as it is.

A Quick Update on the TOCHI Editorial Board

   The TOCHI journal continues to strive for greater heights.

   And in recent events, as an institution it has grown far wiser as well.

   Because I am happy to report that four illustrious new members have
   graciously accepted my invitation to serve on the Editorial Board:

   — Pourang P. Irani (University of Manitoba);

   http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~irani/

     — Per Ola Kristensson (University of Cambridge);

   http://pokristensson.com/

     — Wendy E. Mackay (Université de Paris-Sud); and

   http://insitu.lri.fr/~mackay/

     — Albrecht Schmidt (University of Stuttgart).

   http://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/people/prof-dr-albrecht-sc
   hmidt.html

   Each of them are accomplished innovators, lecturers, and researchers—if
   not a force of nature in their own right—and I’m very excited for the
   vision and guidance they will all bring to the board. And these
   reinforcements arrive just in time, too, as TOCHI is on a record pace
   for new submissions this year, with manuscript #155 having just entered
   the queue as of mid-July.

   And that doesn’t even count the revisions.

   So needless to say, there’s plenty of editorial work to go around. Our
   average response time continues to hew to about 50 days, although
   admittedly this obscures a highly bimodal distribution: we decline many
   submissions within a few days, while those that go through full
   external reviews usually take longer. We strive to issue a decision
   letter within 90 days, but that isn’t always possible—especially during
   the summer, when almost all prospective reviewers (somehow having the
   gall to enjoy their sunny holidays) tend make themselves rather scarce!

   And if your manuscript has been with us for more than 90 days, please
   do feel free to query tochi@acm.org so that we can check on its status.
   Such queries, when necessary, often constitute a useful prod to stir
   reviewers and editors (including myself!) to imminent action.

   Perhaps now is also a good time to remind everyone, oh ye of the
   faithful TOCHI readership, that 2016 will herald the first annual TOCHI
   Best Paper Award. We expect to make our selection(s) in early 2017,
   with all papers published in Volume 23 being eligible. I would love to
   receive your nominations for our best papers published in 2016, to be
   sure they receive full due consideration for the award. Just drop us a
   line at tochi@acm.org. And please do include a brief statement as to
   why you think the paper is especially deserving—that may be just the
   thing necessary to push it over the top, given the consistent
   excellence of all the work that we publish.

   authors by Aptara, as specified on the author style guide
   pages: http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style and
   http://www.acm.org/publications/word_style/word-style-toc/.

Guidance on Fair Use of Third-Party Material

   ACM has published Fair Use Guidelines for authors whose manuscripts
   include third-party material. Please read them
   here: http://www.acm.org/publications/guidance-for-authors-on-fair-use

ACM Policy on Author Representations

   ACM has a new Author Representations Policy, which may be found
   at:http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations.

Changes to ACM Author Rights

   New options for ACM authors to manage rights and permissions for their
   work: ACM introduces a new publishing license agreement, an updated
   copyright transfer agreement, and a new author-pays option which allows
   for perpetual open access through the ACM Digital Library. For more
   information, visit the ACM Author Rights webpage at authors.acm.org.

Changes to Conference Presentations

   You may be aware that in past years all accepted TOCHI papers were
   offered the opportunity to present at the next CHI conference. We are
   happy to announce that this policy is now expanding to include other
   ACM conferences, including CSCW and UIST. This list of conferences may
   expand to others associated with SIGCHI.

   Each paper will have the opportunity to present at only one conference.
   Authors will choose their preferred conference shortly after their
   paper is accepted. For conferences other than CHI, a liaison from the
   conference will evaluate the paper to judge whether it has a topical
   match to the conference. In the (hopefully rare) event that the liaison
   feels there is not a match, then the authors will still have an
   opportunity to present at the CHI conference.

   The recently approved SIGCHI policy on TOCHI presentations can be found
   here.

HCI and the Body: Reimagining Women’s Health

A Special Issue of ACM Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction (ToCHI)

   Deadline for Abstract Submissions: April 5th, 2019

   In the HCI community we have seen an increasing exploration of
   technology in relation to the female body and women’s health. Much of
   this work had explored the role that technology can play in supporting
   transitions to, and experiences of motherhood. Such a focus reflects
   the wider approach of commercial technologies to the female body – that
   related to reproductive health. In the last five years research focus
   in relation to women’s health has broadened, entering into more
   intimate, taboo, and politically charged topics. This has included the
   design and evaluation of tools for enabling intimate anatomical
   knowledge, through to explorations of digital approaches to advocating
   for changes in policy relating to women’s health issues (from topics
   such as breastfeeding, parental leave through to abortion rights).
   These advances in the multiple experiences, voices and concerns of the
   female body and women’s health not only trouble the kinds of methods we
   have available for doing design and for evaluating our design work, but
   also define and redefine the limits of the technologies and
   interactions we create. So much of women’s health involves concern
   about parts of the body and topics which are normally highly personal,
   off-limits. The placement and uses of digital materials and
   technologies may be orientated or inserted in relation to the body in
   ways which the HCI community has rarely explored. Questions remain
   about how we as a community can best approach the body and women’s
   health in ways which are appropriate, inclusive, while also
   contributing to the improvement of women’s health experiences at a
   global level. We ask also how such new possibilities can be deployed,
   the risks of these deployments, as well as the means by which these
   interactions can be evaluated not just at an individual level, but also
   at the socio-cultural and political levels which are widely understood
   as constructing and limiting women’s health experiences.

Information for Contributors

   This special issue aims to provide an inclusive perspective,
   acknowledging that biology alone does not dictate gender, and that the
   female experience is more than menstruation, pregnancy and motherhood.
   We wish to highlight the ways in which the digital intersects with the
   female experience, roadmap opportunities for digital technologies
   within women’s health, as well as provide critical and speculative
   perspectives on what technology means and could mean within this
   context.

   Articles might contribute to this special issue in the following ways:
     * Scoping reviews and evaluations of existing women’s health
       technologies (including for example the self-sampling for HPV,
       menstrual tracking applications, technologies for sexual wellbeing,
       menopause awareness and management, etc.)
     * Ethnographies and/or interaction criticism that unpack women’s
       health experiences and digital re-presentations of the female body
     * Theoretical revisitations of the relationships between the body and
       digital technologies scoped to women’s health
     * Applications and designs (including critical and speculative) which
       respond to a full spectrum of women’s health experiences
     * Activism, advocacy and/or more general politics associated with
       worldwide access and experiences of women’s health
     * Design methods and processes which engage with, respond to, and
       reimagine the body in women’s health

   We will use a standard journal review process for this special issue,
   with two rounds of reviews and revisions. Authors are encouraged to
   submit a short abstract (300-500 words) and a tentative title prior to
   the full paper submission to be reviewed by the special issue editors.

ToCHI Best Paper Award 2017

   ACM TOCHI is happy to announce the 2017 best paper award winner:
   “Motion Correlation: Selecting Objects by Matching their Movement” by
   authors Velloso, Carter, Newn, Esteves, Clarke and Gellersen.

   Using eye gaze and gestures to interact with interfaces is gaining
   traction. Here we are shown important lessons learnt in how to design,
   implement and evaluate the use of eye gaze to select objects on a
   screen — be it a smartwatch screen, a large wall-mounted screen or
   selecting Internet of Things objects in our surroundings. The principle
   is to represent available objects by motion in the interface, have
   users identify a target by mimicking its specific motion, and use the
   correlation between the system’s output with the user’s input to
   determine the selection. The work is firmly based in a thorough
   understanding of human perception, explored in a range of different
   systems, arriving at a set of design principles and generalisable
   concepts.

Call for Papers: Special Issue on Human-Building Interaction


Call for Papers

Human-Building Interaction

A Special Issue of ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM TOCHI)

Deadline for Submissions: (be sure to see also our author’s instructions)

     * December 8, 2017: Informal submission of abstract to special issue
       editors at HBI-TOCHI@unifr.ch.

   Submission of an abstract is not required, but very strongly
   recommended for prospective special issue authors.
     * January 12, 2018: Submit Full Manuscript at
       http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tochi.


Information for Contributors

   We seek original contributions for a new Special Issue of TOCHI on
   Human-Building Interaction.

   Built environments increasingly incorporate interactivity and
   context-aware automation. Human-Building Interaction (HBI), as an
   emerging research field, seeks to develop an HCI lens to the vision of
   our interactive experiences with built environments.

   A special issue of TOCHI on Human-Building Interaction invites research
   contributions that examine the engagement of HCI in the evolution of
   buildings and urban spaces.

   In particular, we solicit articles that pursue the new coordinates that
   HCI should take into account when shifting attention and scale from
   “artefact” to “environment.” For example, the investigations on the
   occupant comfort across multiple dimensions (e.g., thermal, visual,
   acoustic, respiratory), the discussions of the interplay between user
   agency and building automation, the reflections on the immersive and
   durable user experience design, and so forth.

   We seek contributions that address these and similar topics that embody
   the complexity of human’s individual and collective experiences with
   and within the built environment. The invited topics include
   technological innovations, ethnographic studies, as well as conceptual
   and framing contributions.

   Between the lofty and mundane discourses of interactive architecture
   and connected products lies considerable space for grounded research
   and reflective discussion.

   This special issue invites attempts to capture, share, and expand what
   is already known, what is contested, and what are opportunities for a
   common scientific grounding for prospective dialogues and discourses in
   the area of Human-Building Interaction. It will serve both as a
   unifying stage for the existing voices that are centrally and
   peripherally working on HBI, and a platform for the research area to
   move forward.


   The HBI special issue is interested in questions including (but not
   limited to) the following:
     * How can HBI designers reconcile the complexity of human decisions
       with the efficiency that the automation systems promise? What
       services do we expect the building to provide seamlessly, and where
       do we want to retain the manipulation control, and through what
       interaction modalities?
     * What are the UX design challenges in creating buildings that can
       adapt to their occupants’ contextualized needs and preferences?
     * Surveillance is increasingly common to provide security. How does
       the need for surveillance interplay with the privacy concerns which
       are especially elevated in inhabited environments?
     * What can we learn from the comfort literature in the scholarly
       domain of architecture, and how can an HCI perspective complement
       and (possibly) correct the current comfort discourses?
     * In what ways can built environments support and take advantage of
       social and cultural diversity?
     * Are architecture and interaction design methods and processes
       compatible? Concretely, how can a team of interaction designers
       bring their tools to an architectural project?

And We Award the Inaugural TOCHI Best Paper Award, 2016, to…

     __________________________________________________________________


   We interrupt your regularly scheduled blog posts for a special message
   from TOCHI’s Editor-in-Chief, Ken Hinckley, who shares with us some
   breaking news…
     __________________________________________________________________


   Banner for ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction Best Paper
   Award, 2016

   And yes—thank you, because indeed a very special moment in the history
   of the TOCHI journal has arrived, and herein we unveil the inaugural…


ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction

Best Paper Award

— 2016 —

   So sit back, grab some popcorn (and perhaps a beverage of your
   choosing), and enjoy the festivities.


   With the Full Red Carpet Treatment. Of course, on such a celebratory
   occasion, we must roll out a luxuriant red promenade.

   For a fleeting moment, we even considered a military parade for this
   inaugural occasion. But budgets being what they are, the best we could
   afford turned out to be a brigade of “Reviewer 2’s” armed with sharp
   red pens. To be brutally honest we feared this would not go over well,
   to say the least, and so all such plans were scrapped forthwith.

   And with the reality of the publishing industry (as of early 2017)
   being what it is, our “red” carpet, I am afraid, must be printed solely
   in black and white.

   Furthermore, rather than a plush walkway, the substrate upon which we
   must strut our stuff is much more akin to recycled newsprint.

   But what a venue it is!

   Okay, enough fun for now.

   So let me set the stage for the award, and in so doing, switch to what
   my wife calls, my serious voice…
     __________________________________________________________________

   Because it takes incredibly hard work to get into TOCHI, and many
   notable HCI researchers have published their work in our pages. Even
   more important, I think, is the wave of up-and-comers in the field who
   are constantly breaking new ground. We are honored to have played a
   small role in building their careers, and publication credentials, as
   well.

   TOCHI plays a vital role in the HCI community because it offers a forum
   for results that sprawl beyond the tidy boxes, tied up with neat satin
   bows, that can sometimes come to dominate typical conference papers.
   I’ve certainly written my fair share of those (only without the
   neatness, and often with some loose ends in those bows as well…). And
   of course there is nothing wrong with the “typical” conference-paper
   type of contribution, but by the same token it’s really important that
   the field has venues for results that are “out of the box” in a
   sense—and indeed, that span multiple boxes in the form of
   cross-discipline work, as well.

   In that regard, the article we’ve selected for our 2016 Best Paper
   award is a great representative of the field. It reports on an
   interdisciplinary effort that advances the needs of a particular user
   community, but in so doing pushes on boundaries of interaction design
   and computer science as well. In order to build the system the authors
   embarked upon, the research had to upend some conventional wisdom
   regarding image navigation and innovate new interaction techniques
   along the way.

   So (drum roll please), without further ado…


   The recipient of the 2016 TOCHI Best Paper Award is:

     Plaque for the inaugural TOCHI Best Paper Award, 2016

   And just to pique your interest in this fine work just a bit further,
   the following abstract characterizes the work in the authors’ own
   words:

      This article describes the design and evaluation of two generations
     of an interface for navigating datasets of gigapixel images that
     pathologists use to diagnose cancer.

     The interface design is innovative because users panned with an
     overview:detail view scale difference that was up to 57 times larger
     than established guidelines, and 1 million pixel “thumbnail”
     overviews that leveraged the real estate of high-resolution
     workstation displays.

     The research involved experts performing real work (pathologists
     diagnosing cancer), using datasets that were up to 3,150 times
     larger than those used in previous studies that involved navigating
     images. The evaluation provides evidence about the effectiveness of
     the interfaces and characterizes how experts navigate gigapixel
     images when performing real work. Similar interfaces could be
     adopted in applications that use other types of high-resolution
     images (e.g., remote sensing or high-throughput microscopy).

   Check it out. You’ll be glad you did. By the time you read this, the
   article should be available in the ACM Digital Library for
   open-access—sporting a spiffy new award badge no less—at:

TOCHI Article Alert: Fall Prevention for Older Adults: Qualitative Results
from a Long-Term Field Study

   Falls are one of the chief causes of serious injury among older adults,
   often ultimately resulting in reduced quality of life and a transition
   away from independent living.

   This work deploys a sensing system with an interesting set of exergames
   aimed at early intervention through improved physical fitness and
   regular assessment of the risk of falls. While many challenges were
   encountered in deploying the system, and the user population was
   necessarily limited to relatively able-bodied individuals due to
   ethical and safety concerns, a six-month deployment with older adults
   in their homes as well as in community-dwelling situations showed great
   promise in empowering individuals to monitor and control their own
   fitness, health, and fall risk. Making this an enjoyable and
   entertaining activity that older adults can weave into their daily
   routines could be instrumental in effecting long-term use with
   sustainable health benefits.

TOCHI Article Alert: Applying the Norman 1986 User-Centered Model to
Post-WIMP UIs

   This work takes Norman’s classic notion of ‘cognitive engineering’ and
   updates it to the modern context of touch-based and tangible
   interfaces.

   As the authors demonstrate for the particular case of a 3D object
   rotation task, Norman’s model still has a great deal of explanatory
   power for such a task and may continue to give insights into
   interaction methods and techniques that barely existed as research
   prototypes when his work was first conceived.

   If indeed human beings think with their hands every bit as much (and
   perhaps even more so) than they do abstractly with reason, then perhaps
   in this era of the post-WIMP (Windows-Icons-Menus-Pointers) interface
   our tools for thought have come very far indeed.

TOCHI Article Alert: Investigating Expressive Tactile Interaction Design in
Artistic Graphical Representations

   This article is a wonderful example of something that unfortunately we
   don’t see come through our submissions queue as often as I would like:
   namely, a design-research-centric TOCHI contribution.

   In particular, this article explores how tactile feedback can be
   employed in a multisensory context to augment works of visual art.
   Here, the focus is not on metrics such as bandwidth and speed-accuracy
   tradeoffs—as are traditional concerns in the use of tactile feedback to
   augment pointing devices (for example)—but rather largely unexplored
   questions of expressiveness and new interaction potentials rise to the
   fore. The result, in addition to a richly illustrated contribution, is
   a set of affordances for expressive visuotactile interactions, as well
   as an intriguing design space for tactile augmentation that points the
   way to new user experiences.

TOCHI Article Alert: HCI for Reconciling Everyday Food and Sustainability

   This article is a moving example of how HCI has the potential to tackle
   some of the biggest problems facing the globe by framing these
   challenges as socio-technical design problems that must be met at the
   social, cultural, individual, and yes, technological levels.

   At present most people’s food practices are mundane and often routine,
   but as particularly the ‘food pioneers’ probed by this study
   demonstrate, there are ample insights to be gained from existing
   practices that could inform the ‘user experience’ of obtaining and
   preparing sustainable food. And indeed, what ‘sustainable food’ itself
   entails is a complex interplay of ideas and concerns about what we eat
   and where it comes from. This is a complex design problem that
   encompasses everything from the in-store experience, packaging design,
   on-line shopping, social and family pressures, and awareness of the
   provenance of food, to name just a few issues unpacked by this
   far-ranging investigation.

ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI) is the flagship
journal of the Computer-Human Interaction community — and a premier journal
in all of human-computer interaction.

   TOCHI publishes scientific work of the highest caliber and has done so
   since our inaugural issue in March of 1994. Our papers contribute
   analyses of the human impacts of technology, deliver deep insights into
   the latest innovations in interaction design, and reshape how we (as a
   broad and diverse research community) think about the technologies
   that influence people’s everyday lives.

   As such TOCHI is inherently multi-disciplinary, as well as
   inter-disciplinary, and we therefore welcome contributions that
   straddle or combine insights from multiple fields.

   TOCHI emphasizes important and broadly applicable results. Those
   results might take the form of reflections on a significant research
   system. They could be well-justified and well-motivated designs of new
   technologies and techniques. Or they may manifest as careful
   quantitative studies of people and the artifacts they use. In practice
   strong TOCHI contributions are often integrative analyses that embody
   some combination of all of these, and thereby contribute to both the
   theory and the practice of human-computer interaction.

   The journal also considers original work focused on specific domains,
   particular requirements of diverse end-users, and ethical issues that
   influence the design of computing systems and technologies — so long as
   they are framed in a way that makes them relevant and interesting to a
   general readership of human-computer interaction specialists.

   In other words, TOCHI embraces results that span the full range of
   design, technological development, and user experience that make the
   CHI field as vibrant as it is.

A Quick Update on the TOCHI Editorial Board

   The TOCHI journal continues to strive for greater heights.

   And in recent events, as an institution it has grown far wiser as well.

   Because I am happy to report that four illustrious new members have
   graciously accepted my invitation to serve on the Editorial Board:

   — Pourang P. Irani (University of Manitoba);

   http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~irani/

     — Per Ola Kristensson (University of Cambridge);

   http://pokristensson.com/

     — Wendy E. Mackay (Université de Paris-Sud); and

   http://insitu.lri.fr/~mackay/

     — Albrecht Schmidt (University of Stuttgart).

   http://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/people/prof-dr-albrecht-sc
   hmidt.html

   Each of them are accomplished innovators, lecturers, and researchers—if
   not a force of nature in their own right—and I’m very excited for the
   vision and guidance they will all bring to the board. And these
   reinforcements arrive just in time, too, as TOCHI is on a record pace
   for new submissions this year, with manuscript #155 having just entered
   the queue as of mid-July.

   And that doesn’t even count the revisions.

   So needless to say, there’s plenty of editorial work to go around. Our
   average response time continues to hew to about 50 days, although
   admittedly this obscures a highly bimodal distribution: we decline many
   submissions within a few days, while those that go through full
   external reviews usually take longer. We strive to issue a decision
   letter within 90 days, but that isn’t always possible—especially during
   the summer, when almost all prospective reviewers (somehow having the
   gall to enjoy their sunny holidays) tend make themselves rather scarce!

   And if your manuscript has been with us for more than 90 days, please
   do feel free to query tochi@acm.org so that we can check on its status.
   Such queries, when necessary, often constitute a useful prod to stir
   reviewers and editors (including myself!) to imminent action.

   Perhaps now is also a good time to remind everyone, oh ye of the
   faithful TOCHI readership, that 2016 will herald the first annual TOCHI
   Best Paper Award. We expect to make our selection(s) in early 2017,
   with all papers published in Volume 23 being eligible. I would love to
   receive your nominations for our best papers published in 2016, to be
   sure they receive full due consideration for the award. Just drop us a
   line at tochi@acm.org. And please do include a brief statement as to
   why you think the paper is especially deserving—that may be just the
   thing necessary to push it over the top, given the consistent
   excellence of all the work that we publish.

New Updates from ACM

   The following new information was passed along to us recently from ACM.
    Particularly of interest are the new subsidized language services.

Language Services

   ACM has partnered with American Journal Experts (AJE) to provide
   language editing (and translation) services to ACM authors. AJE has
   helped thousands of researchers around the world to present their
   research in polished English suitable for publication in journals such
   as those published by ACM. Editing is available for both Word and LaTeX
   files.

   To take advantage of this partnership, visit http://www.aje.com/ and
   enter referral code ACM15 for a 15% discount off all AJE services.
   (Editing services are at author expense and do not guarantee
   publication of a paper.)

   Please note that formatting assistance is provided at no charge to
   authors by Aptara, as specified on the author style guide
   pages: http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style and
   http://www.acm.org/publications/word_style/word-style-toc/.

Guidance on Fair Use of Third-Party Material

   ACM has published Fair Use Guidelines for authors whose manuscripts
   include third-party material. Please read them
   here: http://www.acm.org/publications/guidance-for-authors-on-fair-use

ACM Policy on Author Representations

   ACM has a new Author Representations Policy, which may be found
   at:http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations.

Changes to ACM Author Rights

   New options for ACM authors to manage rights and permissions for their
   work: ACM introduces a new publishing license agreement, an updated
   copyright transfer agreement, and a new author-pays option which allows
   for perpetual open access through the ACM Digital Library. For more
   information, visit the ACM Author Rights webpage at authors.acm.org.

Changes to Conference Presentations

   You may be aware that in past years all accepted TOCHI papers were
   offered the opportunity to present at the next CHI conference. We are
   happy to announce that this policy is now expanding to include other
   ACM conferences, including CSCW and UIST. This list of conferences may
   expand to others associated with SIGCHI.

   Each paper will have the opportunity to present at only one conference.
   Authors will choose their preferred conference shortly after their
   paper is accepted. For conferences other than CHI, a liaison from the
   conference will evaluate the paper to judge whether it has a topical
   match to the conference. In the (hopefully rare) event that the liaison
   feels there is not a match, then the authors will still have an
   opportunity to present at the CHI conference.

   The recently approved SIGCHI policy on TOCHI presentations can be found
   here.
