Synchronize Files and Folders

   Key features
   FreeFileSync is a folder comparison and synchronization software that
   creates and manages backup copies of all your important files. Instead
   of copying every file every time, FreeFileSync determines the
   differences between a source and a target folder and transfers only the
   minimum amount of data needed. FreeFileSync is Open Source software,
   available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

   Synchronize files with Google Drive
   FreeFileSync version 10.8 adds support for Google Drive as a new option
   to synchronize cloud storage besides SFTP and FTP.
   FreeFileSync directly accesses the files online, without the need to
   install additional synchronization software such as Google Backup &
   Sync.
   This saves the hard drive space that is usually needed for a full local
   copy of all Google Drive files, and enables further performance
   improvements with FreeFileSync's ability to copy multiple files in
   parallel.
   The result of directory listings is buffered by FreeFileSync, which
   allows for future accesses to complete instantaneously. Changes that
   happen outside of FreeFileSync are synchronized automatically by only
   transferring the small delta of differences.
   Google generously has granted high quotas for FreeFileSync's users, so
   even the most-demanding sync scenarios are covered.
   FreeFileSync with Google Drive support can be downloaded from the
   official website: https://freefilesync.org

   Parallel file copy and ad-free installer
   FreeFileSync version 10 has added support for copying multiple files in
   parallel. It is now possible to specify the number of parallel file
   operations for each device inside the settings. During synchronization
   FreeFileSync will then spawn several tasks accordingly instead of
   processing only one file after another.
   This new design offers huge performance improvements for all scenarios
   that are dominated by latency, like synchronization against network
   shares or cloud devices including SFTP and FTP(S). The idle time after
   issuing each file I/O request while waiting for the network response is
   not the limiting factor anymore: The number of parallel operations can
   be set as high as needed until the bandwidth is saturated and the
   network card is operating at full speed.
   The new parallel file operations architecture is not limited to the
   synchronization step, but used throughout the application. Folder
   comparison will issue multiple requests at a time even when traversing
   only a single base folder, by dynamically managing the workload while
   recursively reading the folder tree. Binary-comparison also processes
   all files in parallel.
   The FreeFileSync installer is now ad-free! Before version 10,
   FreeFileSync had shown a single advertisement during installation to
   help fund the project. Beginning with version 10, the project is fully
   relying on donations from users to finance its ongoing expenses in
   software development and support. A huge thanks to everyone who is
   contributing to make this possible!

   FreeFileSync adds Support for FTP and FTPS
   Cross-Platform File and Folder Synchronization Software adds Support
   for FTP and FTPS
   FreeFileSync (https://freefilesync.org) has released version 9.1 of its
   free open source file synchronization utility for Windows, Linux, and
   macOS.
   The new version supports synchronization via FTP (File Transfer
   Protocol) and the encrypted variant FTPS (SSL/TLS). This further
   enhances FreeFileSync's capabilities to not only work with local drives
   and network shares but also synchronize mobile and cloud storage.
   FreeFileSync eliminates the tedious and error-prone task of manually
   identifying files that have changed on the source folder and copying
   them to the target folder, no matter what protocol is used to access
   files. Users can set up mirror, two-way, or custom synchronization
   rules, and then create batch jobs that run the sync without requiring
   manual interaction. Batch jobs can be started with a simple mouse
   double-click or triggered automatically by a task scheduler.
   FreeFileSync detects moved files and reproduces the move on the target
   drive. This avoids time consuming file copy and delete operations and
   instead completes the task with a single hard drive access. This even
   works in mirror synchronization scenarios where the target file system
   does not support file IDs (e.g. FTP/SFTP) or has unstable file IDs
   (e.g. FAT).
   FreeFileSync includes features that are normally found only in the
   premium versions of commercial applications. It can copy locked files
   using the Volume Shadow Copy Service, compare file content in binary
   mode, handle symbolic links and run real two-way synchronizations
   including detecting conflicts and propagating deletions. FreeFileSync
   fully supports long file paths with more than 260 characters, copies
   NTFS extended attributes, security permissions and alternate data
   streams. The application takes advantage of 64-bit and multiple CPU
   cores if available and is fully Unicode compatible.
   FreeFileSync supports MTP (Media Transfer Protocol), making it easy for
   users to synchronize files and folders between their PCs and their
   iPad, iPhone, Android smartphone, tablet, digital camera, digital audio
   players, or other MTP devices. The tool is fully integrated with
   Windows Explorer and allows users to jump to their MTP files in
   Explorer, open them directly with their default application, or to drag
   and drop MTP folders from Explorer into FreeFileSync. FreeFileSync
   supports FTP, FTPS, SFTP, enabling web developers to publish changes to
   their local website copy by running a FreeFileSync batch job - with
   only a double-click of the mouse.
   The software has been optimized for usability and performance. It can
   scan a hard drive with hundreds of thousands of files in a few seconds,
   while scanning multiple folders in parallel. The synchronization steps
   are laid out in the optimal order that minimizes peaks in disk space
   consumption and FreeFileSync's fail-safe file copy algorithm prevents
   data corruption when the synchronization process is terminated
   unexpectedly, e.g. due to power loss. Graphs and detailed messages give
   relevant feedback and provide structure on multiple visual and textual
   levels: getting an overview of a hard drive's space distribution can be
   quickly accomplished by navigating a directory tree showing file count
   and sizes below each node.
   Pricing and Availability
   FreeFileSync is available without cost. FreeFileSync runs on Windows
   XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10, Mac OS X 10.8 and newer, and all major
   distributions of Linux.

User Reviews

   Thank you very much for keeping FreeFileSync up and constantly
   improving it for nearly 10 years! I am using your great piece of
   software since version 3 and never had any issues with it. Moreover,
   it's by far the fastest and most easy to use tool for backup &
   synchronization jobs! I highly appreciate the open source character and
   the powerful batch capabilities as this allows me to install the
   software free of charge on all PCs of my acquaintances (mostly elderly
   people with not much knowledge about computers) where I do the
   maintenance and support.
   — Andreas Hüller
   I haven't even downloaded it yet but so far everything about your
   website gives me total confidence that I am about to get some really
   beautifully executed software! Great 'Vision' statement; FAQ is
   marvelously thorough!; intro demo video (ditch the music!); the feature
   list (wow!!); manual looks wonderfully comprehensive yet clear; very
   little not to love, so far!
   — Carl Spagnoli
   Awesome program; thanks so much for developing this! I use it to back
   up all of my important data files that I store on a separate disk on a
   nightly basis, and have recovered from a hard drive failure with zero
   loss once already. Excellent program!
   — Steve Storm
   Just wanted to say that I'm DEEPLY Grateful to you, for creating a
   truly AMAZING program, and for keeping FreeFileSync always on top of
   its game with the frequent and substantial updates you do on it! I
   don't know much about coding, but what you do my friend — I consider to
   be OUTSTANDING work of great quality. I'm not religious, but may you be
   blessed sir!
   — Daniel Peev
   This program already helped me a lot, and I am not even using it to its
   full potential. I like how 'close to the user' the interaction with the
   files is. At every point in time I know exactly what the program does.
   When it comes to the safety of my files, this is how I want it to be.
   Thank you very much!
   — Adrian Stroschke
   After trying other shareware-licensed software for data file syncing, I
   found FreeFileSync is a great tool to use. A simple, yet powerful data
   sync tool for Windows. And I'm amazed it's free. Highly recommended if
   you are after a simple tool that syncs your data to any drive,
   computer, network drive or remote cloud storage.
   — Juan Caballero
   I have no idea why I have never found this before, because I've been
   looking for something that did exactly this forever, and it does it
   better than I ever hoped for!
   — Amanda Hopkins
   Great stuff. Competitor was AllwaySync, lost due to missing FTPS. Yours
   could be even nicer if it included a scheduler or a mechanism to inject
   the scheduled task automatically into the platform scheduler. Thanks
   for the work.
   — Martin Baur
   Been using FreeFileSync for years for small things at my home computer
   and I really appreciate your commitment to improve the code and to make
   things better for the world of people out there that you don't even
   know. Thank you so much!
   — Dor Juravski
   FreeFileSync is a mature and robust application. After using it for
   years on a daily basis I never had problems with losing data. An
   amazing feature of FFS that is difficult to find in similar
   applications is the ability to synchronize open files on network
   drives.
   — Marcio Tibirica
   FreeFileSync is pretty awesome. It keeps my two laptops and external
   backup drives in sync. User friendly with self-explanatory buttons.
   Extremely fast synchronization. Keep up the amazing work in updating
   this software.
   — Dr.Janaka Vithanage
   Great! I've been searching for this kind of program for ages. Bonus
   would be keeping a backup of mail and browser data (Thunderbird and
   Firefox to keep it in the open source family) — which is two key items
   difficult to auto store in customized archives.
   — Lars-Roger Moe
   Hello Zenju, this app is the only app that syncs files correctly on a
   Mac. GoodSync and other apps can't find changes when the files are
   deleted. And only your app can delete into Mac's Trash folder! 5 Stars!
   Big thanks for developing FreeFileSync!
   — Christian Schmachtenberger
   FreeFileSync is 99% perfect. I love it. I cannot tell you how much
   benefit I am getting from it and how much labor it is saving me. The
   user interface is superbly designed and the functionality is terrific.
   — James Gordon
   I've used this software for the better part of four years now. I can't
   even begin to speak of how useful it has been to me during that time.
   — Adam Novagen
   This program has been a life-saver. Powerful yet intuitive sync with
   many options to filter and customize. In this day and age when I never
   know if an update will break my computer, it's been wonderful to have a
   reliable way to back up my data!
   — Jeff Rau
   Hi there. I just have finally migrated away from Windows permanently
   and this program has been my life-saving replacement for TreeComp. It
   is actually better and quicker, and an absolute gem to use. You are a
   genius, thank you so much.
   — Tim Clayton
   This software is so cool that I like it very much, it just feels as
   convenient as SVN or Git. Thanks to your team of developers.
   — 徐 鑫
   I found FreeFileSync to be extremely helpful, dependable, very easy to
   use — a wonderful experience all around to use this program. All other
   (and expensive) backup programs were uninstalled — I no longer have any
   use for them. :-)
   — Stefan Pawlik
   I've been using FreeFileSync for some years because it is reliable, it
   is very easy to use and it has all the features needed to keep files
   synced between different folders and devices. Thanks for the good work
   you have been doing.
   — Paulo Boto
   Thank you for this amazing software, been searching for it for a while
   as a solution for syncing games in a LAN Gaming Center without
   resorting to a Gaming Cache Server. Your solution is much better when
   implemented properly.
   — Mahmoud Shatila
   Keep up the great work. Your solution keeps helping me to organize my
   data across several computers in an intuitive fashion. It is stable,
   doesn't crash and does a rock solid job.
   — Frank Sattler
   I gave up on MS SyncToy — it wasn't deleting files and folders properly
   when mirroring and was creating duplicate copies of overwritten files.
   FreeFileSync works perfectly and is easy to use. Absolutely first-rate
   software!
   — Robert Bunnett
   I'm glad I found this program! Helps me a lot to back up my media files
   to multiple external hard drives. I was going to make a script but this
   is much more useful.
   — Jasper Riku Antero Lehikoinen
   This is one of the few programs I would actually be happy to pay for,
   as the updates are often, the author is awesome, the pictures of
   animals in the installer are super awesome, and it actually works as
   advertised.
   — Colin Smith
   This is top-notch software, so glad it doesn't require the slow bloated
   .NET Framework! I love to support high quality independent software
   development. Keep up the great work!
   — Josh Straub
   Hello, I chose your software because it was the only one I found that
   syncs my music from PC to Android phone. It's seriously well-made,
   including tutorials. Vision is pretty nice and clear too! So, thank
   you.
   — Bernard Rene
   Have used this in the past to great satisfaction. Just came back,
   because ... well, you just have to have this. Way outperforms anything
   you can do manually and better than any other tools I've seen so far.
   — Jan Derk Otter
   Been only using FFS for a couple of days, but I already think it's
   pretty amazing. I'm happy to see the archive has frequent release
   updates. Keep up the good work!
   — Shai Ben-Naphtali
   Thank you for this software! It is brilliant to have such an easy to
   use reliable sync tool. It makes doing data backups quick and painless.
   Being free was a real surprise!
   — Robert Coleman

   tool! Thank you for all your work on it.
   — Nathan lacroix
   I use FreeFileSync and RealTimeSync to back up my files on my NAS and
   synchronize it automatically on several computers running on Linux and
   Windows. This is a great and efficient tool. Many thanks.
   — Daniel Lathuilière
   Thanks for a great app. It really gives peace of mind knowing that
   files are backed up right. Especially when I discovered image programs
   aren't transferable to another computer. FreeFileSync files are. Yeah!
   — Dale Dudas
   Thanks for continuing to develop this fantastic piece of software. I
   use it multiple times a week and it performs flawlessly.
   — Nathan Rudyk
   I have dabbled with this tool for a couple of years. Time to get
   serious, and FFS has proven itself worthy of a production environment.
   — Jack Riggen
   I've been using FreeFileSync on my laptop for years now. It's a very
   easy and useful tool. Try it once and it's forever. The best in its
   category. Thank you guys for the job done so far.
   — Michel Plaza
   I've been using FreeFileSync for a while, and it is simply the best,
   most reliable synchronization tool that I've come across. I expect I'll
   still be using it for years to come!
   — Willem-Jan Olwagen
   This is the most useful tool and about the best free software I've come
   across in a long while.
   — John Craig
   Great product, I was able to synchronize all my data from my old HDD to
   the new one, after the transfer crashed using another software. Thanks
   for saving me hours of work!
   — Michel Garcia
   I am doing frequent data transfers and have recommended this product to
   others. I have used ycopy in the past and this is in the same vain, but
   on steroids. Thank you.
   — Morgan Barlas
   Thanks you for this great program. I'm using it to back up/sync my
   laptop/desktop systems via FTP. It's fast to the point and reliable.

   (between RAID NAS drives, between work laptop and virtual machines)...
   Keep up the great work!
   — Jason Burgess
   I was waiting for a solution like FreeFileSync for years. It's a dream:
   existing pro synchronization services, pragmatic updates.
   Congratulations to the developers!
   — Christian Saury
   Finally! A simple yet powerful backup utility that has answered all my
   prayers. I don't need some fancy pants overpriced slow arsed software —
   FreeFileSync is #1.

   appreciate the fact it works on all major platforms, including Windows,
   Mac, and Linux.
   — Brian Bunnell
   When my machine's power supply failed it scrambled my hard disk. The
   backups with FreeFileSync allowed me to quickly recover my data with no
   loss.
   — Timothy P Merriman
   I knew I should have just looked for an open-source solution to file
   synchronization rather than wasting my time with commercial trial
   software!
   — Brian Tao

   — Siarhei Bokach
   Thank you for continually filling a huge gap and for making things
   possible that were previously only dreams!
   — Tiziano Riolfo
   This is best file transfer software ever. I have three backups and one
   button helps me keep them all synced.
   — Khan Shahzada Haleem
   Maybe one of best synchronizing tools! I know some others too! But this
   one did exceed my expectations!
   — Gerhard O.
   Much better than SyncToy... and without having to find and install
   other development tools. Thank you!
   — David Satterlee
   One of the best pieces of software that I know anyway. Keep up the good
   work for this a top-notch sync tool!
   — H Kooistra
   Been using for syncing a couple of directories across the LAN, pretty
   solid most the time. Thanks for the app!
   — Karl Engstrom
   Fantastic software. Easy to use for sync. I've been searching for
   months to find a good package. Thanks!
   — Farhang Jalali
   Thank you for providing this awesome program! I've been using it for a
   while, and I really appreciate it!
   — Lawrence Flathmann
   Fantastic program, tried a few to do the job I needed doing and this
   one beats all the others hands down.
   — Steve Downing
   I have been using this for years. Fast and reliable, has saved me from
   losing work a few times. Love it!
   — Robert Olsen
   Fantastic product. I've been using it for a few months now and files
   between two computers are syncing perfectly.
   — Andrea Hatley
   Excellent, works like a charm. I was long looking for something like
   that to keep two large HD identical.
   — Olivier Lengwiler
   I've used your program many, many times. It works great. Thanks for the
   great product!
   — Kile Reeves
   I just love this tool! Works great. Thank you for this project and keep
   up the good work! Best regards.
   — Pia Gross
   It has become my preferred sync and backup program meanwhile. Keep on
   developing and improving!
   — Frank Nitsche
   Phenomenal job! As a fellow software developer, I appreciate your hard
   work and wish you all the best.
   — Mark Franchi
   Thank you for this great sync tool. I use it to back up to my external
   USB hard disks. Great software!
   — Ralf Peiler
   Thanks! Keep it up. For years this has been my go-to for keeping my
   external hard drives up-to-date.
   — Matthew Ell
   To me, the best file sync tool! No bugs, everything is clear, constant
   updates. And very simple to use.
   — Joao Parrinha
   Great app! I've been using it for many years — it really helps and
   saves a lot of time. Thank you!
   — Александр Лебедев
   Tried half a dozen packages till I found yours. Wish I'd found it first
   — does everything I need.
   — Ian Abbott
   Keep up the good work! FreeFileSync is essential for my backup
   strategy! Thank You!
   — Robert Schurig
   This is the sync program that I will work with from now on. I am very
   grateful for its existence.
   — Jim Brook
   Before I knew about FreeFileSync I used SyncToy, but FreeFileSync is
   better and quicker. Thanks
   — Hartmut Boesch
   FreeFileSync rocks! I use it for my backups and I'm looking forward to
   the auto-update feature.
   — Scott Wang
   Awesome product! Can't wait to utilize all the great features in the
   free software. Thanks!!!
   — Patrick Monette
   The best file sync tool ever. I use it every day to sync and backup my
   data. Thank you
   — Salim Belgroune
   Thanks for the continued AWESOME software :-) I have this for both
   personal and professional use!
   — Robert Smithlin
   Beyond being a great piece of software, FFS has saved my butt a couple
   of times! Thanks!
   — Cary Collett
   Much better than Microsoft Briefcase to which I held on for much too
   long. Thanks for your work.
   — Annette Maier
   I keep my info backed up with a click. Easy to use and understand.
   Thank you for your hard work.
   — Harry Krause
   Like using your program. I like the way you can fine tune the rules for
   backing up each folder.
   — Larry Oliver
   FreeFileSync is the best replacement I found when support was dropped
   for Microsoft Briefcase
   — Michael Kilbridge
   Hi, Dev! Congratulations for the Software. It's very useful. Keep
   developing it! Big hug!
   — Wendell Vaz De Almeida
   Works great — just what I was looking for. Thanks for allowing me to
   evaluate free of charge.
   — Kevin Forth
   Thank you for FreeFileSync! Works nicely and is slick (after figuring
   out all the options ;-)
   — Lex
   I have found it to be the best file sync software I have used, of the
   many I've tried to date.
   — Wilbert Janson
   Well done! I love this software. This is the best software for
   synchronization. Thank you.
   — Cong Thinh Bui
   Thanks for the program! Exactly what I was looking for and better than
   I expected! Cheers.
   — Albert Young
   Love the great cross-platform support! I use FreeFileSync on Arch Linux
   and Windows systems.
   — Nathan Hoffman
   GREAT work guys! I'm counting on you for my personal syncing among my
   backup drives. Thanks!
   — Alejandro Ayerza
   One of the most useful utility programs that I have come across and
   which I use repeatedly!
   — Alex Burjan
   Great program. Good work. Simple, powerful, easy to use and working
   fine with every release
   — Grégoire Lauber
   It's a very good program! Very useful! Thank you for creating this
   program. From South Korea
   — Kim Han
   Thanks for the terrific program. Needed a Briefcase replacement. Got
   that and much more!
   — Damien Josefiak
   Thanks for keeping it ad free! Love this software and couldn't do my
   backups without it!
   — Palka Lukasz Kazimierz
   Thanks for this wonderful sync tool that simply works where many others
   fail miserably!
   — Harrer Christian
   VERY, VERY great tool, far beyond majority of commercial app! Many
   thanks! And go on!
   — Vincent Bourquin
   Awesome application. Really fast performance, and it works exactly as
   you would expect.
   — Alfonso Ruiz Martínez
   I am using it since ... I don't remember. Easy, reliable, good. I
   recommend to anyone.
   — Tomasz Stankiewicz
   One of the best software programs I've used and I've used a lot in the
   past 40 years.
   — James Gord
   This has been my goto file sync tool for years. It's an A+ piece of
   software!
   — Jeff Reed
   Solid as a rock. Previously only DSynchronise was close in terms of
   reliability (having tried a whole load of free and paid-for software).
   Super easy to use and runs flawlessly. The one thing I would wish for
   is the ability to automate running various configuration profiles or
   batch files. I,ve done so by creating a .bat file to run all the
   batches and can't really complain. Thanks to the author for this little
   gem.
   — Aiadi
   FreeFileSync is truly a fantastic program and it is portable too. I
   have installed it on an USB stick. I had been using Syncback for over 5
   years. I found that FreeFileSync is the only open source freeware that
   can match the paid version of Syncback software in terms of speed in
   handling folders with huge number of files (up to 30Gb). It runs
   perfectly in Windows XP SP2. Its web site says FreeFileSync can run in
   Linux as well. Many thanks to the author Mr. Zenju. I am sure this
   software will in time become an extremely popular download.
   — Winson Cheung
   This free sync program is the best! No need for commercial products
   anymore after discovering this. Been using it for a few months now.
   Never gonna look back! With each new release speed and features have
   increased.
   — sarlacc
   I have worked with Vice Versa and FreeFileSync. There is no comparison.
   FreeFileSync is one of finest and most important applications ever
   written. It works perfectly and handles a critically important computer
   task that too few people do. Vice Versa had at least one fatal flaw
   that was insurmountable: If folders had to be created on the
   destination side, they were created in all lower-case, regardless of
   the case of the source side. Consequently, the subsequent compare
   always failed. Their tech support was supposedly unaware of the
   problem, could not resolve it, and eventually avoided further contact.
   FreeFileSync is as good as it gets.
   — George ALEFantes
   I love this program. It's the best file syncher out there and the fact
   it is open source makes it better. Now with a x64 version it is
   superior to anything else out there.
   — wolssiloa
   This has become my favorite file synchronization tool. Even Araxis
   Merge seems to have lost its appeal. FreeFileSync uses some special
   undocumented APIs to accelerate folder reads, and it shows! Also, with
   the ability to use 3rd-party tools like WinMerge or RapidCRC to compare
   at a click, it's pretty simple to view changes before committing.
   — Ascend4nt
   Far better than other sync tools for my needs. I was looking for
   something to backup new and updated games from my Steam library (over
   200GB) to an external drive so I can uninstall games to free up space
   and not have to waste bandwidth re-downloading if I want to play them
   again.
   With FreeFileSync, the scan/comparison results are presented well with
   lots of statistics, there are buttons to filter the results view with a
   single click, and I can exclude folders in the right-click context menu
   (sub-folders are not expanded automatically). The interface is kept
   simple by having certain elements context-based - buttons that don't
   have any use to your current task/step in the sync process are hidden.
   I accomplished what I was trying to do quickly and didn't need to refer
   to the help file.
   The previous sync tools I had negative experiences with were DirSync
   Pro (too complicated) and Microsoft SyncToy (not complicated enough to
   be useful).
   — TakeNapEveryday
   FreeFileSync has replaced my data backup software (Acronis) with the
   feature "file-versioning". It allows you to keep a current full backup
   whilst archiving any changes/deletions. This feature can't be
   emphasised enough and is more useful than most backup software that
   starts with a full version and then keeps incremental or differential
   archive formats. FreeFileSync can run as a batch file and use VSS.
   — nw0001
   Does pretty much everything I need to do better than MS Synctoy. I had
   started off with Synctoy hearing good things until I found out it won't
   copy files that are in use. Now I'm using FreeFileSync to sync my XBMC
   database from my media center to my regular PC. It works like a charm.
   I also use it to keep my music synced across 2 computers (I like having
   it in both places) as well as my Portable Apps. It reads the changes
   ridiculously quick, copies files in use, and the interface stays
   relatively responsive.
   — webheaded
   One of the best sync programs I've found for Windows and Ubuntu. This
   software has a streamlined interface that allows access to the most
   frequently used features quickly. But also allows many advanced tweaks
   like what to do with deleted files etc. The program is fully featured
   yet not bloated. I've used it for about 3 years and really haven't
   found anything else this well written. Keep up the good work! Love it!
   — wchang778
   Amazing program! I love it and use it every day. Thank you for such a
   useful and powerful utility. I couldn't run my photography business
   without it. I make sure all my important files are backed up and it
   allows me complete control over what gets copied over and when. It's
   saved me a number of times. Thanks again.
   — Justin Hoch
   I've been using your tool FreeFileSync for maybe 3 years in a private
   environment on Windows 7 with some Linux networking and I'm happy with
   its ease of use and reliability.
   There weren't a lot of things that the world was missing, but FFS was
   one of them. I know companies who sell the same tools very expensively
   with licenses over 20 pages with more headache for using them. Thank
   you, best wishes from Hamburg.
   — J. Pohl
   Thanks so much for Free File Sync (FFS)!!! Following problem has
   haunted me for years: Now that I have a 64-bit Win7 Pro OS that
   supports UNC paths up to 32K I thought the problem would be
   automatically resolved. But no, the dreaded 260 character path limit
   was STILL HAUNTING ME DAILY.
   I have tried UNC paths, \?\ trick, SyncToy, Robocopy, Robomirror,
   Richcopy, and the MS Hotfix for long paths. Nothing worked, all failed
   for my needs. Then I found FFS. And it just works. I will donate at a
   later date.
   — E. L. Faure
   Thanks for your work to date on this project and your phenomenally fast
   responses to bug submissions. I think this is a great piece of software
   and will only get better with your enthusiasm. I was so impressed that
   I was happy to make a small donation. Keep up the good work :-)
   — kjen33
   I have just discovered your wonderful FreeFileSync software. For years
   I've been using ViceVersa which runs on Windows. Now I have moved
   everything to Linux, and searched for a ViceVersa replacement in vain.
   But the discovery of FreeFileSync changed everything. It's BETTER than
   ViceVersa!! Out goes ViceVersa and I have yet another native Linux app.
   — John G.
   Just had to say that FreeFileSync is really great. It's like the best
   and simplest out of all sync programs and I have tried quite a few,
   including famous ones. Thank you very much for your time and effort
   creating this software for the common good. ^_^ I hope you live a long
   and happy life.
   — Samuel K.
   I think your FreeFileSync application is pretty awesome. I've only
   recently discovered it as I was looking for a good sync program to use
   on iMac/OSX Yosemite and found some reviews for it.
   Previously I've been using FolderMatch v3.7.0 for PC but it's quite old
   now and doesn't seem to get much in the way of support/updates. Anyway,
   since I started using FreeFileSync on my Windows 10 PC and iMac I've
   been really pleased by the ease of use, performance and features.
   Really great job!
   Given the above I've just donated £10 via PayPal so it should be with
   you soon. Honestly, I can't remember ever donating to free-ware before
   but I'm so impressed with FreeFileSync I felt it would be wrong not
   too!
   — Anthony
   An excellent program with several unique features of its own. Can
   handle some stuff that even some fully commercial products can't.
   Zenju is very responsive to queries, active in the help forums and
   always striving to make it better. What more can we ask? I like it so
   much I've hit up Paypal and sent him some cash. Well worth it.
   — smeghead77
   Thank you for your amazing work!
   — guillaumecombot
   Awesome program to sync files! It has extended features and allows
   quite some customization. Batch mode allows custom automation from
   command line (without missing features), which is very helpful for me.
   — hawktroy
   Best file sync tool especially for a mirror data backup. It would be
   nice to have an online mirror backup.
   — biscuite
   Outstanding program. And it's free!! I have used this program for about
   3-4 years now. And it is simply amazing. I had been looking for a
   program like this for years. The one I used to have was ViceVersa,
   until it became too expensive. It basically mirrors my important
   folders over to my NAS (Sylonogy and D-Link). It does such a great job
   showing exactly what is going to change (delete/add/modify). It's so
   simple to use, but also customizable. You can change the behaviour of
   individual files. Simply the best. Zenju did such a good job creating
   this. Thank you!
   — staminino
   The best of all I tried (Synctoy, Robocopy, etc.) for backing up 50
   laptops to a server. Simple config, nice features: versioning, omitting
   select folders (like /AppData), daily logs for checking health. Easily
   automated using Windows Task Scheduler. Support is excellent, better
   than I've ever seen from anyone!
   — David C. Menges
   FreeFileSync is an impeccable program that we recommend to each and
   every one of our customers for backing up their data.
   — asapdata
   Super software! After 3 years of use I have only good impressions!
   Thanks and good luck!
   — rusnetrus
   This program is outstanding. Very easy to use and setup. Reliable. Does
   what it says on the tin!
   — orangereaper
   Easy to use and works exactly as I need.
   — kaffeinatedneil
   I've tried many other free software titles but this one beats them all!
   Simple, easy and fast!
   — christopheperus
   Definitively the best sync program available. I've tried multiple
   others, even commercial ones. No comparison to this one!
   — Andy
   Very reliable application. It has everything you need for local files
   synchronization. I'm looking forward for Google Drive and FTP support.
   — Elvedin Hamzagic
   Fast and easy to use. Allows me to sync selected directories between
   laptop and desktop quickly and accurately. Options include sync,
   two-way update, and clone. Works with Win 8.1, 7, and XP.
   — carlcobb
   Now that the venerable FileSync has mysteriously stopped working on my
   PC, I am relieved to find FreeFileSync works well for me in similar
   ways.
   — chishold
   Surely the best sync application currently including paid ones. Simply
   the best and works flawlessly. Meets the requirements of people who
   have to work on multiple systems.
   — Uday Krishna
   The best sync util I've found. I am using it since version 3. It is the
   easiest way to keep a complete synced mirror from my laptop to my
   desktop user's folder. Highly recommended!!! A++++
   — Danurica
   This is the best file copy and sync program which I have ever used.
   Well done!
   — Raymond Cheung
   The file filter specification (inclusion and exclusion) brings
   incredible power to this free software. Thanks for showing us that free
   can be (much) better than paid software.
   — gaetan
   We use this app in our 2-man team to keep Dropbox and several PCs in
   sync. No issues whatsoever. Highly recommend.
   — Vlad
   Very good app. Helps me sync between PCs and portable hard drives. The
   best backup app I've used. Best of all, it's free!
   — Gary
   Works perfectly! I use it to backup files from my Uni-Server... Keeps
   me up to date every week with one click. =)
   — Chris
   Great app and very useful tool. Bug-free. Intuitive. Has everything you
   can imagine for file synchronization. Copy. Backup. Compare...
   — Elvedin
   Saved my life in the most critical times... Recommended to everyone.
   — Excellent
   FreeFileSync just makes things easy by improving over successive
   versions. One of the best applications/tools I have ever used. Strongly
   recommended!!
   — Peri
   I love this application. It is simple to setup and use and extremely
   useful. Have used it for moving files server to server, backing up my
   documents, and even keeping my ISO directory in multiple places.
   — Jethro
   I used Richcopy to copy terabytes of data from one set of drives to
   another. Then I found this tool and found that Richcopy didn't copy
   thousands of files. FreeFileSync found the missing files and copied
   them over for me fast and pain-free. Thanks!!!
   — Kevin Parks
   This has to be the most useful free tool ever released. I'm a network
   administrator and when moving file servers, this tool outperformed
   Robocopy, Symantec, and many many others.
   — ray
   I'm using this tool for quite some years now. It's better than all the
   others I've tried before, and in addition it's completely free! Thanks
   a lot for your splendid work!
   — drujo
   Best tool for sync, we can use it on our server for folder backup.
   — Surya Prakash Joshi
   A really good program and I will always support you.
   — Jhshin
   One of the most useful free applications I have come across and one I
   use regularly. Keep up the good work. I know how much more difficult my
   life would be without FreeFileSync.
   — David (UK)
   Best tool for folder synchronization. The different settings for the
   right and left side are very good. I was looking for a long time for
   this tool. Thank you for your great work.
   — Ottokar
   Works great and it's free. I have mine set to automatically run every
   day at 4:00 PM on my Mac OS X.
   — chrispublic123
   Excellent, works perfectly between my MAC and my corporate server based
   on a Microsoft environment. The only "bad" point that I see, is the
   usage of Realtimesync, a tool to automatize the synchronization when a
   folder becomes available. It's not fully explained how to manage more
   than one directory!
   — amaygeoz
   Most useful application. During all these years that I've been using
   it, it has gotten better and better.
   — Marios (GR)
   Just started using FFS: Majestic software for backup. I promise to
   donate after a few months of use. I was using Microsoft SyncToy which
   MS never tried to improve. Kudos FFS Team.
   — Harikumar
   Great software. Requires a bit of time to set up if you want to use
   real-time sync, but it's fast and easy. I'm using it to copy files to
   and from my portable hard disk so I can work at them both at home and
   at work and it works flawlessly.
   — Olivia Stevens
   Awesome!! I have been looking for an application like this for months!!
   Finally I found something that can efficiently manage all my folders
   (photos, music, text files, applications, etc.) which I am constantly
   editing and for which I need to create backups for on my laptop, ipad,
   2 external hard drives and virtual hard drives such as icloud, dropbox,
   google drive, one drive etc.
   This software is simple and easy to use, has important necessary
   features and best of all is quick for syncing between all these
   devices. Highly recommended!
   — anthonysan
   This is really a wonderful product developed with a specific purpose
   and does that job brilliantly. I love this for taking a one time
   backup. This is what I have used so far.
   — rahulnischal
   Awesome and reliable sync software you can count on. I've been using it
   for more than 3 years now. Best I have used so far for syncing.
   — Peri2
   Works like a charm to sync my laptop with my external disk and my home
   NAS. I will not use anything else!
   — Sundesh
   Absolute best. I wish I could point to some issues but I can not think
   of any major flaws. One minor is that there is no ability to choose the
   installation language and so it forces an auto-detected language but
   that is all. Great app.
   — infinum
   Kudos to the developers. Just works 100% of the time. Long-time fan and
   appreciative user.
   — Colin
   Just perfect for syncing local and/or network drives. Best free tool I
   have ever found. I run it on Debian (how about packaging it in .deb?)
   and in windows portable versions. Congrats to the team and thank you.
   — Stratos
   Works perfectly on Mac!!! :-)
   — Pe Klak
   Just the tool I dreamed of! Thanks for offering it for free!
   — titi74
   Operation is intuitive and simple while powerful features like
   mirroring, backup, synchronization, etc. can be done manually and
   automatically. I've been searching for such a tool for a long time and
   tried several others. Up to now nothing is comparable to FFS.
   — dcamarena
   Best tool for folder synchronization. Thank you for your work.
   — GK
   I've been using FFS for more than one year now and I just love it. It
   makes my life easier when I need to backup my files. There are several
   syncing options you can choose, great friendly layout. Simply the best!
   — Anonymous
   Love this product. I use it to keep a backup list of all my files.
   Quick, easy to use, with some fantastic features. If you need to keep
   folders synced, this is the product to use.
   — MIKE
   Excellent program! Very intuitive and streamlined operation. Has all
   the file synchronization features I need and then some.
   — Nico Gotin
   Works like a charm. Easy to use. I can't live without it.
   — martin
   One of the greatest little housekeeping gadgets around. Great work,
   thank you!
   — Rayborn
   Really solid utility. Fantastic features, easy to use, fast and
   reliable. From a former user of SyncToy.
   — Matthew T
   Simply the best synchronization program. Already use it for more than 3
   years and never had any problems. Congratulations to the developers!
   — Tiago
   I have found the sorcerer's stone and it is FreeFileSync.
   — allijeanbean
   Excellent product! Backing up my digital photo collection is trivial,
   even as I move folders around, change photo ratings, etc.
   — patricknbowman
   Great application. A must-use for any file management solution, super
   rich and easy to use.
   — Spaz
   Moved from SyncToy to FFS - much better, faster, less problems. Thank
   you.
   — Mark
   Best of all!!! No doubt, forget Synctoy. Now 5 years using it on
   Windows without trouble.
   — rodob
   Used to use MS synctoy but it's so out of date you can see there is no
   future in it. Looks like sync center is the way to go for MS native but
   I have Windows 7 Home so I don't have that choice.
   Anyway, came across this, judged it on downloads per week and gave it a
   go. Really impressed, easy to setup and with just a little reading you
   can get it to do realtime sync with RealTimeSync that comes with it!
   Looks like it's maintained well and kept up to date (big plus) and I
   like the way it can use Windows Shadow Copy for locked files. Great
   stuff and thanks!
   — jonafc
   Great for differential backup using synchronization. :)
   — Anonymous2
   I tried many backup software before FreeFileSync. Let me tell you, this
   is the most user friendly backup software I have seen. I have been
   using this for the past 2 years and found it very useful.
   — Paari
   Excellent and portable. It's my favorite solution to sync my devices
   and make backups. Useful options and intuitive interface. I just have
   created this account to say thanks to the author.
   — jslopezg
   The best!
   — Kero
   One of the best, if not THE best. Very powerful and fully customizable
   through scripts. Thanks for creating it and making it free and open
   source.
   — eahm
   Excellent synchronization software! It has an intuitive interface, and
   copies reliably. It quickly gives you an accurate idea of potential
   conflicts before you start a copy job, and it does a good job
   visualizing the progress of the job as it progresses.
   — Erin R.
   Full stars. I've been working with it for years already. Makes backups
   very easy and perfectly. Even works over networks. Very good, very
   reliable.
   — Roland
   The most powerful file synchronization tools I have ever seen. Use it
   every day!!
   — karnonlm
   I've been using FreeFileSync for two years and it is great. I donated
   through PayPal :-)
   — Umberto
   I have been using FreeFileSync for the last one year and have been a
   very happy user. It is easy to install and very easy to configure and
   use. I would recommend FreeFileSync usage.
   — Mahinder Nath
   The best free synchronizer I know. Even a small effort to facilitate
   the selection of directories and it will be perfect. Thank you very
   much to all the team for this software that I use every day!
   — Antoine
   The most amazing and useful piece of software I have. Particularly the
   versioning feature, which allows me to perform my backups with file
   history in a more useful manner than general backup software. It works
   well and is well designed.
   — nw0002
   Better than SyncToy. It's my favorite now!

   I use FreeFileSync for months and I am very happy with this software.
   Thank you and congratulations to those who developed it, improve it and
   update it regularly.
   — Hervé Guillain
   A wonderful tool! Peerless! Tons of thanks to its maker...
   — bunnybat
   Excellent software! I love it!
   — Link Liu
   A good sync tool needs reliability, batch capability, a compare-only
   mode, and configurable rules for dealing with different out-of-sync
   cases. FreeFileSync has all of those and a straightforward user
   interface as well. I really can't think what I would add.
   Congratulations to the development team!
   — Patrick B
   Exactly what I was looking for! Nice program, easy to use interface,
   works like a breeze!
   — Edo Hulsebos
   Favourite tool I have used. Thanks so much. Makes keeping my USB stick
   and google drive in perfect sync.
   — DG
   Really replaces rsync for windows.
   — altex
   It works very well. I sync a whole folder located on my note, including
   a local *.pst from outlook to flash drive.
   — Leonardo Dias
   Works beautifully in multi-platform (Ubuntu Linux, Windows, Mac)
   environments.
   — Auke
   Great program! Easy to use, transparent, and does a great job syncing
   files.
   — Erin R2.
   This is a great software for free. It works so good and it comes with
   no junk.
   — Happy User
   I have used a bunch of backup software, some paid and some free. But,
   Free File Sync is the simplest most straightforward way to back up
   files. All I did was copy the pertinent directories to a 1.5 TB USB
   connected drive, then set up a batch file in FFS to run every day at
   noon and sync the two directories. Like magic it works flawlessly. And,
   rather than go through some clunky interface to restore something it is
   a simple as going to the external drive and copying the files back.
   — Bob in New Hampshire
   I created an account just to post my praise to the author. Class A
   material. DFS Replication with Windows Server was proving to be a
   nightmare. Deleting files without reason, failing to replicate in both
   directions, erroring out, just becoming an overall headache.
   This solution was not only intuitive to use, easy to integrate, and
   easy to confirm functionality (The log files are heaven sent - They are
   concise and to the point yet in depth and serve a purpose), but is
   extremely powerful with the configurable batch jobs. Kudos to the
   author, and thank you for providing such an awesome product. :)
   — seannn
   Excellent! Fast, easy-to-use, multi-platform and free: the best file
   sync tool, that I have ever used.
   — Adrian Toth
   Kick ass on both Linux and Windows: definitely a top-100 open source
   project! Much appreciation to the developer for this great app! :)
   — jmj288
   Best tool I've used for keeping in sync between home, office and
   abroad. Thanks!!!
   — nicolaes
   I've tried many different programs for file synchronization. I stopped
   when I started using FreeFileSync. Thank you for developing such a
   superb and super-useful program. I am recommending it whenever I have a
   chance. Keep up the already-very-good work. Cheers.
   — M. Del Gatto
   I have been searching (for a long time up to about 2 years ago when I
   found FreeFileSync) for a utility that does this, even contemplated
   creating my own. FreeFileSync is a one stop solution that does it all,
   and does it the way I expect it to. And its versatile and user friendly
   enough to compare files produced by the engineering tools I use. I've
   even used it to check disk transfer speed in real life scenarios, works
   like an absolute charm.
   It really became a tool I use extremely often, it's one of my must
   have's like 7zip. It beats "Unison" hands down for user friendliness
   and speed to install and get on systems. It beats the tool "Beyond
   Compare" hands down because it's open source and freely available, but
   I have to say, I'd love the "Beyond Compare" capabilities, but I cannot
   justify its cost. FFS does enough for me that I can do without it.
   — Chris Bosch
   I've been using this utility for more than a year now and still
   recommend it!
   — Caspar Schutte
   Lots of really useful small details: The right mouse click on gear
   icons and grid rows, the quick selection change via overview window and
   space bar, copy and paste of filters and much more.
   — blues12
   Maybe the best synchronisation program you can get: it's fast and
   intuitive, relatively easy to learn, and, most important, very
   reliable.
   — the-nightowl
   By far the best and most flexible file sync software I have come
   across. Allows for customization. The only software I know that allows
   you to only sync files that exist already in both source and
   destination folders. This feature comes in handy to do versioning.
   — Kris N
   After wasting $40+ dollars on a competitor's product, I tried out
   freefilesync. FreefileSync was able to compare hundreds of thousands of
   files (NAS->NAS) in 10 minutes, which was taking the competitor's
   product over 3 hours. I ended up deleting the competitor's product and
   relying on FreeFileSync. Awesome, awesome backup program.
   — lechuan
   For the longest time I was looking for a simple straightforward
   synchronization program to make weekly backups. Finally I found it.
   Thank you guys for making this sublime program available for free.
   — ،ثثس
   Excellent sync software; replaced SyncToy with this when I realised
   that SyncToy had gradually wiped rather than backed up my files. Works
   well; can't believe how much quicker it is!
   — Simon
   Since I am a backup paranoiac because I have lost data several times, I
   want something that is quick and painless. This is super easy to use.
   It also, since it does not give me an error message, copies all the
   files that a windows copy and paste would not copy because the file
   names are too long or they are organized in too many sub-folders (what
   a hassle that is, but that is another windows problem). Have I
   confirmed this by testing and verify copying? No. It is easy enough to
   do, but I am way too busy.
   Just like people believe in their country and a God, I believe in
   FreeFileSync. The best part is that you are not spammed with advert pop
   ups or anything like with other freeware. Thank you so much
   FreeFileSync!
   — VendeeClown
   What an excellent piece of software. Initially deployed as an
   experiment, has turned into a staple in my toolbox. I have it set up
   for an hourly mirror sync via Task Scheduler and it has proven itself
   time and time again. Nearly three million files synced, hourly
   revisions are kept on another drive and then compressed monthly... this
   is one beautiful piece of software. Thank you so much.
   — iamvii
   Thank you for this awesome sync software. I tried a lot - free as well
   as pricey alternatives, but when I finally found this I knew my search
   had come to an end :)! It has an easy and intuitive UI and all the
   features you would want from a sync tool! Funny how free stuff beats
   the commercial versions again and again...
   — mcfex
   It is the ideal application to synchronize my files between two
   computers and one file server. I was testing before a few other
   solutions, but FreeFileSync is the best of the best!! Thank you for
   this project! Best regards.
   — mutancik
   Excellent utility for synchronizing two hard drives and/or important
   directories! Easy to use and fairly intuitive. Short learning curve.
   For the reviewer looking for "Help" resources, it is right there on the
   top left of the screen next to the Tools tab. Program is fairly
   documented in the "Content" selection.
   — abeali
   Great FREE sync software that actually replaced my 'paid' for app. Keep
   up the great work, thank you! :)
   — mradeveci
   SO awesome. There's so much I could say about this indispensable
   program, but I'll just tell you now that the amount of options and
   different types of sync methods will ensure you are able to do what you
   need, as well as the ability to save your sync configurations for
   certain sync jobs, so that you can easily do them in the future.
   Great UI, please don't change it, because too many people are ruining
   their software these days with some new crap that renders their
   software useless, literally making it impossible to do anything. Keep
   up the GREAT work, developers, you really know what you're doing <3 You
   rock mah socks! ^_^
   — space0ctopus
   Was using Unison, but there weren't many updates and it doesn't support
   x64. FreeFileSync is very simple to use! Also it is much faster than
   Unison! I recommend it!
   — geek-man
   Very intuitive, and because of its flexibility it's possible to have
   portable backups since it can backup to a relative file path. Then you
   won't need to change destination path when you move the backup folder.
   — estogram
   Fast, easy and reliable. A great tool to keep two (or more) folders
   synchronized (even when changes have been done on both sides since the
   last synchronization). Excluding certain files or folders from
   synchronizing is quick and painless.
   The application will warn you when too much has changed in the folder
   contents since the last sync. It supports batch jobs. I personally use
   this software to backup my personal files onto an external hard drive.
   It works great through my home network too. Without a doubt, I prefer
   FreeFileSync over Synctoy and SyncBack. Thank goodness for
   FreeFileSync!
   — zenphic
   After the death of my home's NAS I was in big trouble... But now,
   thanks to FreeFileSync, I have all my data saved in a so easy way that
   I am not looking for another NAS. A couple of external cheap hard disks
   are enough!! (and FreeFileSync, of course) :-) I am sharing my
   experience through my international contacts. Hoping to find more
   supporters for your GREAT work. Thanks for all.
   — odj1964
   This is a brilliant piece of software. It is simple to set up and easy
   to use. I have been using it for a few months now and it has never
   crashed. I use it to sync to my Dropbox via BoxCryptor encryption. I
   don't completely trust auto syncing software, so this is a great
   alternative. It allows you to keep your original files on your
   computer, and also save separate back up files on your external drive
   or Dropbox etc. Well done guys!
   — rogerturner2
   This tool is a really nice application. I've tried countless sync
   tools, both free and paid. This is the one I've chosen to use. It works
   great in both Windows and Linux. Many many thanks to the developer(s).
   I know how much time and energy it takes to code and maintain something
   like this. I appreciate it. Keep up the great work.
   — dtshudy
   Excellent Program. A HUGE improvement over Sync Toy that I've been
   using for years. Anyone who wants to sync or backup should download and
   use this program. Many thanks to the developers
   — deibiddo
   This program is excellent. I have been using it between 2 computers for
   3 weeks and no issues. I was using SyncToy for a few years with few
   problems, but recently SyncToy began to delete the newer files, some of
   which I spent hours writing. Thankfully I found FreeFileSync and it is
   working perfectly.
   — oid-3857101
   It is very easy and works over network, local drives and external ones.
   A must-have if you use more than a computer and huge files make cloud
   drives an unfeasible option.
   — piterdias
   I wanted to synchronise a Windows 7 64-bit Notebook, an iMac (Lion)
   with Samba enabled. I have a lot of data to synchronise, about 150 GB
   and 200,000 files. I've tried SyncToy from Microsoft, Windows 7
   built-in synchronisation center, AlwaySync, Syncback, SkyDrive, and so
   on... Each of those tools took VERY long in the good case, or hanged in
   the bad case :-(
   And I tried FreeFileSync: It does exactly that I wanted to do, and it
   is really very fast. It scans my 200,000 files in only 2.5 minutes!!!
   So I'm VERY happy with FreeFileSync.
   — oid-3813974
   I have tried two other free synchronisation software suites: Synkron
   (also SourceForge software) and RichCopy (from Microsoft). FreeFileSync
   is better than both of them for a number of reasons:
   1. Intuitive user interface: I setup a multiple folder synchronisation
   within minutes! The buttons are clear, and if you aren't exactly sure
   of their function, hovering the mouse over the buttons will reveal
   clarifying information.
   2. Informative: I knew exactly what files were being deleted or
   updated. The initial "compare" function is MUCH clearer and easier to
   use than Synkron's "analysis" function. Synkron would give no
   information about the analysis while it was occurring, so you don't
   know what progress it is making. FreeFileSync lets you know how the
   comparison is going, and gives a very handy graph to show progress,
   including file transfer rates, etc...
   3. Stable: I have not yet had FreeFileSync crash on me. RichCopy and
   Synkron have both crashed, and Synkron tends to freeze the system.
   4. Efficient: Synkron writes the synchronisation files to a backup file
   for some reason which I could not disable in the settings. This both
   slows the system down, but also uses up a significant amount of hard
   drive memory over time, since these files are not deleted. Quite simply
   the best free synchronisation software I have ever used!
   — mechtengineer
   Very cool. Now it helps me to keep folders in sync and backup files
   from internal and external hard discs, mp3 player and my phone... :-)
   Many thanks to the developers.
   — magickz
   Best out of all 5 sync programs I've tried, both commercial (Goodsync,
   AllwaySync) and non-commercial (SyncBack, SyncToy). Don't waste your
   time trying other "commercial" ones. THIS IS THE BEST.
   — executerror
   This is one of those tools you cannot live without. I use FreeFileSync
   at least twice a day, to update the full backup I keep in a USB stick.
   Every month I also mirror my work files into a removable USB-2 drive.
   Once I waited for 3 months to update into my second removable drive and
   I had to wait for only 25 minutes, even though I had changed a lot of
   songs and videos. Moreover, my USB stick backups take no more than 3
   minutes for a full day of work.
   The creator of FreeFileSync was kind enough to respond to some
   suggestions I made, but it's hard to think on improving this program
   because it is already great!
   — adimare
   Really love this program and have been using it under Windows a lot.
   Now have an iMac and was really missing this program, so I am very
   happy to see that there is now also a MAC version. Thank you very much.
   — oskar101
   Faster than commercial alternatives. Perfect to make backup and update
   SVN repositories.
   — farcodev
   This is a really well done piece of software. The GUI is intuitive. It
   is fast. The file transfers are fast. I am really impressed with this
   tool.
   — jashale
   I love the simplicity of this. Other programs compress and bundle which
   is unnecessary and obfuscating. This program is actually easier and
   simpler than copying folders by hand, because once you've set up your
   paths and saved them in profiles, you just choose the profile. If you
   put a little effort in at the beginning working out what needs to be
   backed up, then the existence of the profile in the list reminds you
   that you need to do a backup of it.
   — andycivil
   I am a 20yr IT vet (really!) I do minor programming and I have had the
   need for a feature rich program that will get the files from A to B
   without issue and save security information. FFS is simply the best in
   the market hands down. The fact that it is free totally blows me away!
   Since my initial review we have come to use this product in our daily
   processing. The fact that the developer truly listens and incorporates
   good effective additions as well as continuing to improve the product
   puts him ahead of even larger software houses. Please keep up the good
   work and look for our donation! James Lee Outsource Technologies Inc.
   — coogrrr
   I have used a lot of sync tools. I am sure FreeFileSync is one of the
   best tools available in the market out there. Above all it is free!!
   Thanks a lot to the dev team for contributing such a wonderful product.
   — oid-3474008
   After successful tests, i permanently installed the program with 6 TB
   of data exchanged between 2 x 3 hard disks (12 TB total) and it since
   works reliable and fast. It's even better than the best commercially
   available software, so there goes a big THANK YOU to the fantastic
   programmers and the GNU open source community & last but not least to
   sourceforge!!
   — weathercontrol
   The best file backup and sync software I have used for far. It's quick
   and easy to use. Please keep this software portable as that is one of
   its greatest assets. I use it to synchronize between multiple
   computers, drives, and operating systems seamlessly. Having a dual OS
   has never been easier. Thank you!
   — wabassoap
   I've been looking for a tool like this for about 3 years, when my most
   favorite directory sync tool stopped development, short of Windows XP.
   GREAT work on this. Clean, efficient, simple dir comparison or sync.
   Run it and it shows you what's out of sync, without all of the
   complicated configurations, etc. that other dir sync tools have.
   Thanks.
   — rgadawg
   Simply the best file sync software and also free backup software: No
   feature bloat, no bugs, does what it's supposed to blazingly FAST!
   — MajorG
   A GREAT piece of software that rivals other expensive software. Very
   versatile and always expanding. The developer is very helpful and
   responsive. Couldn't live without FreeFileSync!
   — srjones67
   I've tried almost every files and folders synchronisation program
   available on windows. And FreeFileSync is definitely the best. It's the
   fastest, the most customisable and the most intuitive one, and above
   all, it's open source.
   — pellk
   Pleasantly surprised after trying 4 others, as it supports my Unicode
   filenames, feels lightweight, and makes the options fairly clear.
   — oid-2658093
   Flexible. Does what it's supposed to do well. I switched from SyncBack
   (free version) to FreeFileSync because it handles a few important
   things better, e.g. copying locked files, more powerful filters.
   — oid-2864505
   Saved my life. Now it takes me 30 sec instead of 45 min to update my
   8000 files / 4 GB on LAN. I learned it in 30 sec. Simple and reliable.
   — doru001
   Awesome scalable tool!!!!! This is the only tool I know which can
   compare and sync 2 directories with more than 11,000,000 files, and not
   die while syncing. It took my server a couple of days to sync those
   monster directories, but hey ... I'm happy! - Theo Ekelmans Ordina

   — Theo
   This is ***THE BEST*** It managed all of my 80,000 files in 489
   directories: No problem!! I have tried at least 10 different sync tools
   in the past 10 years. This is wonderful. It is a 'good looking' friend
   of rsync!
   — anonymous
   Wow! FreeFileSync is the best backup tool I've ever used! I've bounced
   back and forth between many tools over the years, and this one is so
   much simpler (without sacrificing functionality) in so many ways. The
   backup process is quick and reliable.
   — tsreyb
   Great application for all your file/folder comparison and
   synchronisation needs. Allows you to add multiple, specific source and
   target folders and use filters to exclude and include specific files
   and/or sub-paths.
   The generation of a batch script allows you to automate the
   synchronisation, which you set up in the GUI. It can then run regularly
   and in the background.
   The synchronisation dialogue is beautiful, showing you the speed at
   which it happens. Display filters allow you to grasp the changes, and
   preview stats allow you to see the quantity of changes before-hand (so
   you don't make a mistake, moving the wrong way around for example).
   — kissaki
   Probably the best open source software that I have ever encountered. :)
   Keep up the good work!
   — akya
   This app is great! Easy, intuitive backup and synchronisation between
   different folders or devices. And it gets better: It is cross platform,
   so I can use in Win, Linux or Mac! Thanks for the development and
   maintenance of this app! Keep up the good job!
   — isastronomer
   What a simple yet incredibly helpful and powerful program! The user
   interface is flexible enough to house lots of things or to be very
   simple and sleek - and it performs binary comparisons! Cheers for a job
   well done!
   — jeffplemons
   Excellent, efficient tool for manual backup and folder mirroring. No
   persistent services. Does what it promises and is updated frequently.
   Takes advantage of multicore now. A big thanks to the developers.
   — godlymusic
   I've used Microsoft's SyncToy for years and thought it was the best of
   what was available ... that is, until I started using FreeFileSync.
   There's no comparison in terms of all the things that are important:
   ease of use, performance, flexibility.
   — Sam Gerber
   I've been using this tool for a while now and it's simply awesome.
   Former SyncToy user. Best way to keep a Dropbox style of sync with my
   external drives. I also dig the new look. Very stylish.
   — OpenID User
   This is the best file synchronization program that I've found. It is
   fast, stable, and has the right features without being bloated.
   The author has done a lot of careful thinking about how the program
   should work from the user's perspective, and (more importantly) how it
   works under the covers.
   — JohnB in Atlanta
   From my experience until now, it is a great and simple backup software.
   Great performance, analysis, scan, progress bar and graph, great
   comparison, flexible so you can configure multiple folders and multiple
   actions. Nice UI. Does the job as it should.
   — liran1
   Incredibly useful, manages long path names better than anything else we
   tried including Robocopy.
   — robbo7877
   Best file sync software I have ever used. I used to run SyncToy 64-bit
   version, but after running into problems and being unable to fix them
   (as my file count went up) I decided to try FreeFileSync. To this date,
   I have not experienced a single problem, not even a hickup. One
   directory contains over 10 million files, and it runs through with
   ease.
   — joqqy
   Awesome. Much more versatile than SyncToy. I love the fine-grained
   control and also the option to preserve deletions. I use it on a couple
   of identical external HDDs for off-site backups. Different drive
   letters? No problem, just copy the XML config file and change the drive
   letter. Save. Run. Done.
   — cadbloke
   With around 2 million files to compare/mirror, a lot of other tools run
   into problems with memory, long paths or performance (especially 32-bit
   tools, when the memory needed to represent the internal file lists
   exceeds the 2GB process memory limit).
   FreeFileSync not only uses a lot less memory for large numbers of files
   but also provides a native 64bit build, eliminating any possible memory
   problems with large numbers of files (unless you run out of physical
   memory).
   It also supports long paths, does the file listing in multiple threads
   (one thread per drive AFAIK) and has just the right amount of
   configuration options needed to achieve everything without bloating the
   UI with too many options.
   Just started using it today, but I'm really impressed already.
   — Christian Vogel
   OMG!! This is the GREATEST file synchronization tool I've used. I'm an
   Ubuntu user/admin for 3 years now and after testing FreeFileSync, I'll
   stick to it. I think FreeFileSync deserves to be in Canonical's
   repositories.
   — darwin m.
   I got a similar app from PC Magazine a few years ago. I never really
   figured out how to use it. I tried to start it up and it would not load
   for reasons unknown. I googled just in case I might stumble across...
   THIS! It did precisely what I wanted to do. I figured out how to
   operate it pretty darned quick, which is a testament as I'm gettin' old
   and am not as fast on the uptake as I once was.
   — chinnboy m.
   FFS is highly capable and very fast. More importantly, it's very
   reliable: I synchronize about 250K files daily, with typically a few
   thousand changed and about a 500 MB in size and it has yet to mess up.
   I used to use MS's SyncToy, but that name actually characterizes it
   all: a "toy". SyncToy would frequently get confused and want to move
   things in the wrong direction or show conflicts which weren't the case
   (esp. with MS network share drives).
   One of FFS's strengths is how well it handles conflicts, though I have
   occasionally wished it had a one-click-for-the-newest button, it's
   really easy to select a group of files and right-click to send them
   left or right.
   Also, FFS is orders of magnitude faster than Microsoft's SyncToy for
   high-latency drives, like WAN drives; synchronizations that would take
   several hours with SyncToy 2.1 completed in less than 20 minutes using
   FFS (and that was quite some versions of FSS ago).
   The UI is adequate, with some very minor shortcomings, like not being
   able to reorder the list of directories being synchronized. Overall
   it's pretty easy to use, though I think filters and the two settings
   dialogs could be merged into a single concept / dialog. The ability to
   hook in an external compare tool is excellent, and it works very well
   with WinMerge to check exactly what is different between particular
   files.

   session identifier (hereinafter "session-id"), automatically assigned
   to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you
   have browsed topics within the "FreeFileSync Forum" and is used to
   store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user
   experience.
   We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst
   browsing the "FreeFileSync Forum", though these are outside the scope
   of this section which is intended to only cover the pages created by
   the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information
   is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to:
   posting as an anonymous user, registering on the "FreeFileSync Forum"
   (hereinafter "your account") and posts submitted by you after
   registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter "your posts").
   Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable
   name (hereinafter "your user name"), a personal password used for
   logging into your account (hereinafter "your password") and a personal,
   valid email address (hereinafter "your email"). Your information for
   your account at the "FreeFileSync Forum" is protected by
   data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us. Any
   information beyond your user name, your password, and your email
   address required by the "FreeFileSync Forum" during the registration
   process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of the
   "FreeFileSync Forum". In all cases, you have the option of what
   information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within
   your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically
   generated emails from the phpBB software.
   Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure.
   However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password
   across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of
   accessing your account at the "FreeFileSync Forum", so please guard it
   carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with the
   "FreeFileSync Forum", phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you
   for your password. Should you forget your password for your account,
   you can use the "I forgot my password" feature provided by the phpBB
   software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your
   email, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim
   your account.
