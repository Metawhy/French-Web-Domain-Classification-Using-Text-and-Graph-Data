A Japanese A.I. program just wrote a short novel, and it almost won a
literary prize

   By Chloe Olewitz March 23, 2016 4:52PM PST

   AI writes novel for Japanese literary prize Sergey
   Soldatov/123RF.comWhile many people in the world are worrying that
   robots will take over human jobs once artificial intelligence (A.I.) is
   fully developed, it’s a safe bet that no one put “author” at the top of
   the robot job list. Yet, now that a Japanese A.I. program
   has co-authored a short-form novel that passed the first round of
   screening for a national literary prize, it seems that no occupation is
   safe. The robot-written novel didn’t win the competition’s final prize,
   but who’s to say it won’t improve in its next attempt?

   The novel is actually called The Day A Computer Writes A Novel, or
   “Konpyuta ga shosetsu wo kaku hi” in Japanese. The meta-narrative
   wasn’t enough to win first prize at the third Nikkei Hoshi Shinichi
   Literary Award ceremony, but it did come close. Officially, the novel
   was written by a very human team that led the A.I. program’s
   development. Hitoshi Matsubara and his team at Future University
   Hakodate in Japan selected words and sentences, and set parameters for
   construction before letting the A.I. “write” the novel autonomously.
   One of the team’s two submissions to the competition made it past the
   first round of screening, despite a blind reading policy that prevents
   judges from knowing whether an A.I. was involved in the writing
   process.

   For the past few years, the Hoshi Shinichi Literary Award has
   technically been open to non-human applicants (specifically, “A.I.
   programs and others”). This year was the first time the award committee
   received submissions that were written by A.I. programs. All in all, 11
   out of the 1,450 submissions were written at least partially by
   non-humans. “I was surprised at the work because it was a
   well-structured novel. But there are still some problems [to overcome]
   to win the prize, such as character descriptions,” said Satoshi Hase, a
   Japanese science fiction novelist who was part of the press conference
   surrounding the award.

   Of course, many critics and supporters of developments in A.I. agree
   that one of the hardest obstacles for sentient robots to overcome will
   be some semblance of humanity. If A.I. bots can’t relate to humans, it
   will be hard for humans to relate to them. That may factor into the
   disappointing character development mentioned by very human novelist
   Hase. But Matsubara and his team aren’t deterred from the possibility
   of creativity within autonomous artificial intelligence. “So far, A.I.
   programs have often been used to solve problems that have answers, such
   as Go and shogi. In the future, I’d like to expand A.I.’s potential [so
   it resembles] human creativity,” Matsubara said.

This Italian-designed tiny home offers more transformations than meet the eye

   By Clayton Moore March 31, 2019 12:53PM PST
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   A new off-grid tiny home being showcased at this month’s Milan Design
   Week is a marvel of transformative design. Specifically, the
   “residential building with high flexibility,” as it has been designated
   by the Italian architectural firm who built it, has been built to use a
   mechanical system that employs cranks, ropes, and pulleys to
   reconfigure the tiny home on demand into twenty different layouts and
   variations.

   It’s named Casa Ojalá and it is the brainchild of architect Beatrice
   Bonzanigo of the Italian firm IB Studio, which plans to transport the
   new product into position by truck and then assemble it using its
   architectural team. Once in place, the tiny home will grab electricity
   from built-in solar panels and employ a rainwater collection system.
   Although it looks like the design could support a composting toilet to
   give it the most flexibility in terms of location, the prototype design
   has been configured to connect to a “small biological pit” (read:
   septic tank).

   Meanwhile, residents will be able to change their floor plan whenever
   they desire, which is unusual even in the market for innovative tiny
   homes. Movable interior walls can be used, for example, to partition a
   bedroom into two rooms when residents have guests over. In addition to
   the mechanical devices mentioned above, the initial design employs
   screens made of fabric and lightweight wooden walls to change the shape
   of the interior. The living room can also be partitioned or even
   transformed into a large outdoor platform that augments the terrace
   area.

   It has a total floorspace of just 27 square meters (about 290 square
   feet, for those of you who are fans of IKEA’s popular tiny house
   examples). That space includes two bedrooms including one with a double
   bed and one with a single, as well as a bathroom, kitchenette, terrace,
   and a living room, at least in the initial design.

   “Casa Ojalá is a sustainable, minimal, compact and flexible product for
   a new comfort, away from TV or air conditioning,” said IB Studio in its
   promotional materials. “The boundary between inner and outer space no
   longer exists. Outdoor is a substantial, fundamental and precious part
   of it.”

   IB Studio, led by Bonzanigo and partner Isabella Invernizzi, will
   showcase the installation called “Casa Ojalá / Inhabiting the Infinite
   Choice” at the Post Design Gallery Memphis Showroom. The company’s
   portfolio also includes a diverse array of innovative projects
   including a villa in Australia, stately homes in the Tuscan
   countryside, a prize-winning wine cellar in Tuscany, and a restaurant
   chain in Japan.

The best web browsers for 2019

Chrome is a fantastic browser, but is is still the best among new
competitors?

   Picking a web browser isn’t like selecting an operating system or
   smartphone ecosystem. Unlike choosing MacOS, Windows, or Chrome OS,
   where your choices are mutually exclusive, switching between browsers
   isn’t quite so jarring. You could download any one of the major
   browsers on the market today in the time it takes you to finish reading
   this paragraph. But which is the fastest? Which is the safest and most
   private?

   To help you decide, we’ve broken down the best browsers on the market
   today and boiled them down to their bare bones. Even if some of them
   could do with being rebuilt from the ground up, these options are your
   best chance at a great online experience.

The best web browsers at a glance

     * The best web browser: Google Chrome
     * The best Chrome alternative: Mozilla Firefox
     * The most innovative browser: Opera
     * The web browser with the most potential: Microsoft Edge

The best web browser: Google Chrome

   Chrome is ubiquitous — and for good reason. With a robust feature set,
   full Google Account integration, a thriving extension ecosystem, and a
   reliable suite of mobile apps, it’s easy to see why Chrome is the gold
   standard for web browsers. Chrome even blocks some ads that don’t
   conform to accepted industry standards.

   Chrome also boasts some of the best mobile integration available. With
   a mobile app available on every major platform, it’s easy to keep your
   data in sync, making browsing between multiple devices a breeze. Sign
   into your Google account on one device, and all your Chrome bookmarks,
   saved data, and preferences come right along. Even which extensions are
   active stays in sync across devices. It’s a standard feature you can
   find on other platforms, but Chrome’s integration is second to none.

   Google released Chrome 69 to celebrate the browser’s 10th birthday with
   a significant visual redesign and some nice new features. The user
   interface was rounded and smoothed out, losing all of its previous
   sharper edges and harsh angles for a gentler and more attractive
   aesthetic. Tabs are easier to identify thanks to more visible favicons,
   making it perfect for anyone who typically keeps open a large number of
   tabs. Note that as of Chrome 71, you can no longer go back to the old
   interface.

   In addition, Chrome’s password manager now automatically generates and
   recommends strong passwords when a user creates a new account on a web
   page. The search bar, or Omnibox, now provides “rich results” comprised
   of useful answers to questions when they’re typed in, calculator
   results, sporting event scores, and more. Finally, favorites are now
   more accessible, and they’re now manageable on the New Tab page. Some
   of the more recent changes introduced in Chrome 74 include a dark mode
   that follows Windows 10’s theme settings and Incognito Detection
   Blocking so that sites can’t know that you’re running undercover.

   What’s the bottom line? Chrome is fast, free, light, and even
   better-looking. With a thriving extension ecosystem, it’s as fully
   featured or as pared down as you want it to be. Everything is right
   where it should be, privacy and security controls are laid out in plain
   English, and the browser just gets out of your way. If you’re not sure
   which browser you should be using, you should be using Chrome.

The best Chrome alternative: Mozilla Firefox

   Firefox comes in a close second — a very close second. Mozilla has been
   taking real strides in making its browser a truly modern way to surf
   from site to site, thanks to efforts like its upgrade to Firefox
   Quantum and the VR-focused alternative, Firefox Reality. It wasn’t too
   long ago that Mozilla’s rebuilt the familiar old standby browser’s UI
   from the ground up, offering a cleaner, more modern take on what a web
   browser should be, and even introduced a password-free browsing
   experience.

   The changes weren’t just skin deep, though. There’s some impressive
   engineering going on behind the scenes. Firefox Quantum is designed to
   leverage multicore processors in ways that its competitors just aren’t
   doing. It’s not going to make a huge difference in your day-to-day
   browsing, but the Mozilla Corporation hopes it’s going to give it an
   edge moving forward. By engineering for the future now, Firefox Quantum
   is in a better position to take advantage of quicker and quicker
   processors as they come out year after year.

   Beneath those changes, it’s still the same Firefox we all know and
   love. It’s a capable browser, with a deep catalog of extensions and
   user interface customization. The new Firefox Mobile app also received
   the Quantum treatment, so it’s quicker and more streamlined than ever
   before. Grab the mobile Firefox app and you’ll be able to share
   bookmarks between devices, but you’ll have to sign up for a separate
   Firefox account. Unfortunately, managing settings across platforms
   isn’t as seamless as it is in Chrome.

   Even with the recent overhaul, Firefox is a comfortable, familiar
   standby. There’s a bit of a fringe benefit, too. Because it’s been
   around longer than Chrome, some older web apps — the likes of which you
   might encounter at your university or workplace — work better on
   Firefox than they do on Chrome. For that reason, it never hurts to keep
   it around. And the most recent version, Firefox 68, does an even better
   job than ever of keeping you safe from sites that wan to track your
   activities as you surf the web.

   As a primary browser, Firefox doesn’t offer much that Chrome doesn’t,
   but its latest update is making it a very compelling alternative if
   you’re in the mood for something a little different.

The most innovative web browser: Opera

   Also a venerable browser and popular alternative, Opera shares much of
   Chrome’s DNA. Both browsers are built on Google’s Chromium engine, and
   as a result, they have a very similar user experience. Both feature a
   hybrid URL/search bar, and both are relatively light and fast.

   The differences appear when you start to look at Opera’s built-in
   features. Where Chrome relies on an extension ecosystem to provide
   functionality users might want, Opera has a few more features baked
   right into the browser itself. It also introduced a predictive website
   preload ability, and an Instant Search feature isolates search results
   in their own window while the current page fades into the background —
   letting users more easily focus on the research task at hand.

   As of Opera 55, you can also install the Chrome extension from the
   Chrome web store, meaning that not only can you run the same extensions
   as if you were using Chrome, but discovering and installing extensions
   is just as easy as on Google’s popular browser. If Chrome’s wide
   variety of extensions are important to you, then Opera becomes an
   intriguing alternative. With Opera 56, the browser was furthered
   refined, meaning that Opera might just be one of the best browsers for
   quickly navigating web pages.

   Opera also features a built-in “Stash” for saving pages to read later.
   There’s no need to sign up for a Pocket or Evernote account to save a
   page for later reading. Similarly, Opera features a speed-dial menu
   that puts all your most frequently visited pages in one place. Chrome
   also does this but only on a blank new tab. Finally, Opera has a
   built-in unlimited VPN service, making it a more secure option.

   But the biggest changes came with Opera 60 and Reborn 3, a complete
   revamp of the browser’s design that brought a new borderless design,
   Web 3 support, and a Crypto Wallet allowing users to prepare for
   blockchain-based sites. If you’re looking for a feature-packed browser
   that offers some serious privacy and security, then Opera is a great
   choice.

   You can see that we’re well into hair-splitting territory, which is why
   it’s important to remember that your choice of browser is, more than
   any other service or app you use on a daily basis, entirely dependent
   on your personal preferences — what feels most right for you. Opera has
   a unique look and feel, and it combines some of the best features of
   Firefox and Chrome.

The web browser with the most potential: Microsoft Edge

   Microsoft created its own new browser for Windows 10, dubbed Edge, that
   used its own browsing engine and was updated along with the operating
   system. That project was arguably a failure, as Edge failed to gain
   market share even though it was built into Windows 10 and set as the
   default browser.

   In response, Microsoft is rewriting Edge as a Chromium browser, taking
   Google’s lead and making something all its own. The new version is
   currently in beta, and while it bears a passing resemblance to the old
   Edge it’s a completely different browser inside.

   There’s really not much to say about the new Edge at this point. You
   can give one of the beta versions a try if you like, and the browser
   works well enough for simple browsing. There’s the ability to sync some
   — but not all —  settings across platforms, use a limited selection of
   Chrome extensions, and customize the browser in some limited ways.

   So, why are we focusing on the new version when it’s so limited? First,
   because let’s face it — there’s no reason to invest in a browser that’s
   being abandoned by its developer. Second, the new Edge has something
   the old one never did — it runs an all platforms, including MacOS,
   meaning that it’s a more feasible replacement for other browsers that
   haven’t been tied to Microsoft’s OS.

   If you’re looking for something a bit more experimental than Chrome or
   Firefox, just fire up the Edge Chromium beta and see what it can do.
   You might be surprised — or not. And Edge is now decoupled from Windows
   10, meaning it’s being updated more regularly.

Alternative browsers

   While the preceding browsers will meet most users’ needs, other
   alternatives exist for anyone who’s looking for something different.

Apple Safari

   If you run Apple platforms exclusively, then you might want to consider
   Safari if it’s not already your default choice. Safari might not be the
   fastest Mac browser around, with Chrome being significantly quicker,
   but it’s fast enough that you won’t feel too slowed down. And it’s the
   most integrated into MacOS, meaning you’re going to feel more at home
   and you’ll likely get better battery life thanks to some Mac-specific
   optimizations.

   Safari also focuses a great deal on privacy and security. If you want
   to minimize how you’re being tracked and whether Big Brother is looking
   over your shoulder, then Safari is a good choice. If you also use an
   iPhone and/or an iPad, then using Safari on your Mac will make for the
   most seamless transition between platforms.

Vivaldi

   Vivaldi is truly unique. No two Vivaldi users will have the same setup.
   When you run it for the first time, you’re guided through a setup
   process that lays out your browser in a way that makes sense for you.
   You get to choose where your tabs and address bar go, and you get to
   choose if you want browser tabs displayed at the top of the page or in
   a separate side panel. This is a browser built from the ground up to
   deliver a unique user experience, and for the most part, it succeeds.
   Vivaldi 2.0 enhanced the customization features and made them easier to
   access. We certainly enjoyed Vivaldi when we gave it a go.

   This browser excels at customization, and you can choose from a variety
   of tasteful themes that don’t feel dated or out of place on a modern
   PC, in addition to the aforementioned UI choices. It also has
   some stand-out privacy-enhancing features, like a recent team-up with
   DuckDuckGo, to make the non-tracking search tool the default option
   when in privacy mode. Finally, the latest version added more powerful
   tab management, enhancements like Web Panels that make for smarter
   browsing, and (as mentioned) even more powerful customization options.

Brave

   One of the most unusual browsers around is Brave — or, perhaps, its
   Brave’s business model that’s the strangest. Brave blocks all ads on
   all web pages by default, which makes it arguably the fastest browser
   around. Ads are a huge portion of how many web sites make money. Block
   ads and suddenly the most important web financial tool is eliminated.
   That’s where the Brave Rewards program will come in. Users will receive
   “Basic Attention Tokens,” or BATs, when they view alternative ads that
   Brave places in the browsing stream. The users can pass along a portion
   of their tokens to publishers. In the future, Brave hopes that
   publishers will jump on board and offer premium content in exchange for
   BATs.

   What’s in it for users? Simply put, if you’re not waiting for ads to
   download along with web site content, then your web experience is going
   to seem much faster. And, Brave performs no user tracking, making it a
   private browser as well.

Tor

   The Tor Browser is a version of Firefox that serves one very specific
   purpose. It provides a simple entry point for Tor (The Onion Router),
   which is software combined with an open network aimed at making you
   invisible by routing your traffic through a number of anonymous
   servers. While it’s not absolutely foolproof, it’s very difficult for
   someone to identify you when you’re properly configured and using
   something like the Tor Browser to surf the web. Especially if combined
   with a VPN.

   There are a number of legitimate uses of the Tor Browser and the Tor
   network, such as people who live in countries with repressive
   governments, as well as journalists and activists. The dark web is also
   one of the destinations for people using Tor, and that includes a
   number of nefarious and illegal sites. In any event, if you want to
   remain completely anonymous while you’re on the web, then the Tor
   Browser and network are for you.

Benchmark tests

   All right, so you’ve seen our recommendations — but if you still want
   to know more, check out our test results below.

   You’ll notice we dropped both Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari web
   browser from our comparison. Microsoft’s aging browser has had some
   improvements over the years, but it’s no longer the default browser on
   Windows 10, and it doesn’t offer much beyond the bare minimum. It only
   exists today because some companies need it for legacy applications.
   While Apple’s Safari web browser is still used by many Mac users, it’s
   no longer updated on Windows, and so we’ve removed it from the main
   list too.

   Most browsers are compatible with web standards and handle performance
   with relative ease. A casual user probably won’t notice a difference in
   the rendering speed between today’s modern browsers, as all six
   browsers are much faster and leaner than those of a few years ago.

   We ran the following benchmarks on a desktop with an Intel Core
   i7-4770K processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. All browsers were
   clean installs of the most current production versions as of early 2019
   and all were run at their default settings.

   We switched to the latest Jetstream 2 benchmark — which focuses on
   modern web applications — and Edge has retained it’s number one
   ranking. Although there’s a twist: The old Edge version wouldn’t
   complete the test, and so the winner is the Chromium version. Opera is
   in second place and Chrome is close behind, with Firefox coming in last
   place with a significantly lower score.

   Mozilla’s Kraken benchmark has Firefox in a strong first-place finish
   with Edge Chromium coming in second and Chrome in third. Opera comes in
   third and the old Edge finishes in dead-last.

   Interestingly, Chrome and Edge Chromium fell way behind in the HTML5
   compliance test. Opera comes in first and Firefox in second.

   Finally, we also tested how much RAM each browser uses, both with no
   tabs open and then with 10 tabs open accessing the same popular sites.
   We made sure that each browser had no extensions running, and we let
   each browser settle in before looking at its memory use. For the test
   with 10 tabs open, we averaged memory use when all of the tabs were
   first opened and then five minutes later, to account for any
   variability.

   It’s not a scientific test, but it should be sound enough to give an
   idea of which browsers are the most and least efficient in terms of
   taking up your RAM. We found Opera to use the least RAM both when first
   opened and Firefox used the least with all 10 tabs loaded. Chrome was
   much less efficient with multiple tabs opened with Edge Chromium was a
   solid performer in both instances.

Security and privacy

   The most valuable tool for secure browsing is user discretion,
   especially when you consider that every web browser has encountered
   security breaches in the past. In particular, Internet Explorer and
   Chrome’s reputation for protecting users’ security and privacy
   credentials is spotty at best.

   Chrome, Safari, Vivaldi, Opera, and Firefox all rely on Google’s Safe
   Browsing API to detect potentially dangerous sites. Thanks to constant
   updates, Mozilla, Chrome, and Opera all make constant security
   improvements.

   All browsers offer a private session option, too. Private sessions
   prevent the storage of history, temporary internet files, and cookies.
   Browser support for Do Not Track remains spotty, and it’s worth noting
   that a 2013 NSS study showed only Internet Explorer blocking trackers
   used on more than 90 percent of potentially hazardous sites.

   Mozilla has made some strides to try and differentiate itself from the
   others with a real focus on privacy in recent years. It even recently
   debuted a Facebook Container to make it harder for the social network
   to harvest a user’s information.

   Social Media

Take flight, social butterflies! This is the when and where of expert
updating

   social media updating The wonderful world of social media is pretty
   much the digital version of real life, and for some of us that means
   posting something, somewhere at all hours of the day. In order to keep
   up with all the status updates, links, snapshots, and tweets, you need
   to maximize your time, and share efficiently – sending thoughts out
   into the ether won’t do anyone any good.

   Here’s a quick and easy how-to for you to follow so you can ensure all
   your posts on various social media sites get to the right people in a
   timely manner.

Know your topic and audience

   I know you have a lot of important thoughts in your head just waiting
   to be unleashed, but here’s a dose of reality: Not everyone will care
   about whatever it is that you have to say. However, each and every one
   of your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social sites
   will have a specific set of interests – if your post touches at least
   one of those interests, then it’s definitely worth posting.

   After knowing what it is you’re sharing, the next step would be to
   figure out who would be interested in it and what they do on a regular
   basis. Are your close friends all stay-at-home moms or freelancers who
   would have a lot of online time on their hands, or are they Average
   Joes and Janes who maintain 9-to-5 jobs in an office environment?
   Anticipating the type of activities your contacts engage everyday in
   will enable you to properly time your posts to reach the most number of
   people who will give a damn about your latest vacation or that
   thought-provoking article you just read. Otherwise, your update will
   get overlooked and sadly exist quietly without a Like or RT to its
   name.

Know your network and time your posts accordingly

   This is the most important step – the only step that matters, even.
   Knowing your audience is one thing, knowing the social network you
   intend to share to is quite another. Every person has a favorite site
   to go to for their dose of information overload, just like every social
   network has its own culture and user behavior. You need to study your
   friends list on every social site you have an account on and observe
   how your News Feed behaves on each one. Who posts most often on what
   site, and at what time of the day? What time zone do they follow?

   This step actually goes hand in hand with the previous one – aside from
   knowing where your friends are when they use Facebook, you also need to
   take note of your most social media-active friends so you can take
   advantage of their heightened online presence. It’s a good practice to
   tag people on posts you think will either appreciate it more than most
   (and comment on it) or find it interesting enough to pass it on to
   their other friends. Once they comment or re-post your update, there’s
   a higher chance that your post will get more social media airtime.

   Knowing where and what isn’t enough, you need to consider timing as
   well. According to various sources on the Internet, here are the best
   and worst times to post on the following popular social networks (all
   based on EST):
     * Facebook – Traffic on the god of all social networks is almost
       always atrociously high, but it’s most out of control between 9
       a.m. and 4 p.m. The best time to post that photo or link on
       Facebook would be between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., especially on
       Wednesdays at 3 p.m., when most people are perusing their feeds on
       their breaks. Don’t bother posting between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. –
       people will either be busy spending time with their families,
       engaging in offline activities, or sleeping. Posting on weekends is
       also generally discouraged because most people actually prefer to
       live life off the computer outside of work.

     * Twitter – Those who enjoy reading updates limited to 140 characters
       tend to do so from Monday to Thursday, after 11 a.m. The best time
       to post that Twitpic or RT is between 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., while the
       worst is from 8 p.m. to 9 a.m.. Traffic on the micro-blogging site
       starts to dwindle after 3 p.m., especially on a Friday, so try to
       get your tweet in before then.

     * LinkedIn – Linkedin is a social site mostly dominated by
       professionals with regular jobs, so of course it makes sense that
       traffic on this site is usually heavy before and after business
       hours, when users are not busy with their responsibilities – try to
       share posts between 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. or 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.. Anything
       you share between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. on a Monday or Friday will
       probably go under the radar.

     * Pinterest – This particular social network has a timing pattern
       that’s different from others – traffic tends to build up by 12
       noon. It’s advisable to pin posts on Pinterest any time between 2
       p.m. to 4 p.m. or 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays, but if you want to
       reach the most users, Saturday morning is your best bet, as it is
       the site’s peak time. Traffic dies down after 5 p.m., so try not to
       hold off on your pins till late afternoon.

     * Tumblr – Compared to Facebook and Twitter, Tumblr is a whole
       different creature when it comes to social media activity – you
       should consider posting on the site after 4.pm. If you really want
       to get the most attention, make sure you post after 7 p.m., when
       Tumblrers are most active. And unlike most sites that discourage
       posting on weekends, the best time to post on Tumblr is actually on
       a Friday night. Those kids and their crazy late night,
       weekend-Tumblring.

     * Google+ – Yes, contrary to popular belief, Google+ has enough
       traffic to have its own “peak time” for posts, which is after 9
       a.m. Unlike LinkedIn, the best time to post on Google+ is during
       work hours, specifically 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Traffic peters out after
       5 p.m., so don’t bother posting in the evenings.

Get extra serious

   If you are in a profession where social media presence matters a whole
   lot, then you might want to consider using social media tools that will
   give you better insight on how your audience behaves. This is also
   particularly useful for social sites that have don’t necessarily have a
   best time to post since it’s determined on a user-to-user basis, like
   Instagram.

   To track how many times your links are clicked, you can opt to use link
   shorteners like Bitly or Ow.ly. This will enable you to find out which
   social network you have the most reach in.

   If you want to maximize your social media accounts, there are special
   sites that offer a variety of services. SocialBro has a “best time to
   tweet” daily report that analyzes your Twitter followers’ timelines and
   lets you know the exact right moment you can reach the maximum number
   of people that will provide you with retweets and replies. Timing+ does
   the same for people who prefer using Google+. As for Instagram,
   Statigram will provide you a rolling month analysis of your account,
   analyze your usage, and show you a graph that will help you optimize
   your account.

A Japanese A.I. program just wrote a short novel, and it almost won a
literary prize

   By Chloe Olewitz March 23, 2016 4:52PM PST

   AI writes novel for Japanese literary prize Sergey
   Soldatov/123RF.comWhile many people in the world are worrying that
   robots will take over human jobs once artificial intelligence (A.I.) is
   fully developed, it’s a safe bet that no one put “author” at the top of
   the robot job list. Yet, now that a Japanese A.I. program
   has co-authored a short-form novel that passed the first round of
   screening for a national literary prize, it seems that no occupation is
   safe. The robot-written novel didn’t win the competition’s final prize,
   but who’s to say it won’t improve in its next attempt?

   The novel is actually called The Day A Computer Writes A Novel, or
   “Konpyuta ga shosetsu wo kaku hi” in Japanese. The meta-narrative
   wasn’t enough to win first prize at the third Nikkei Hoshi Shinichi
   Literary Award ceremony, but it did come close. Officially, the novel
   was written by a very human team that led the A.I. program’s
   development. Hitoshi Matsubara and his team at Future University
   Hakodate in Japan selected words and sentences, and set parameters for
   construction before letting the A.I. “write” the novel autonomously.
   One of the team’s two submissions to the competition made it past the
   first round of screening, despite a blind reading policy that prevents
   judges from knowing whether an A.I. was involved in the writing
   process.

   For the past few years, the Hoshi Shinichi Literary Award has
   technically been open to non-human applicants (specifically, “A.I.
   programs and others”). This year was the first time the award committee
   received submissions that were written by A.I. programs. All in all, 11
   out of the 1,450 submissions were written at least partially by
   non-humans. “I was surprised at the work because it was a
   well-structured novel. But there are still some problems [to overcome]
   to win the prize, such as character descriptions,” said Satoshi Hase, a
   Japanese science fiction novelist who was part of the press conference
   surrounding the award.

   Of course, many critics and supporters of developments in A.I. agree
   that one of the hardest obstacles for sentient robots to overcome will
   be some semblance of humanity. If A.I. bots can’t relate to humans, it
   will be hard for humans to relate to them. That may factor into the
   disappointing character development mentioned by very human novelist
   Hase. But Matsubara and his team aren’t deterred from the possibility
   of creativity within autonomous artificial intelligence. “So far, A.I.
   programs have often been used to solve problems that have answers, such
   as Go and shogi. In the future, I’d like to expand A.I.’s potential [so
   it resembles] human creativity,” Matsubara said.

This Italian-designed tiny home offers more transformations than meet the eye

   By Clayton Moore March 31, 2019 12:53PM PST
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   A new off-grid tiny home being showcased at this month’s Milan Design
   Week is a marvel of transformative design. Specifically, the
   “residential building with high flexibility,” as it has been designated
   by the Italian architectural firm who built it, has been built to use a
   mechanical system that employs cranks, ropes, and pulleys to
   reconfigure the tiny home on demand into twenty different layouts and
   variations.

   It’s named Casa Ojalá and it is the brainchild of architect Beatrice
   Bonzanigo of the Italian firm IB Studio, which plans to transport the
   new product into position by truck and then assemble it using its
   architectural team. Once in place, the tiny home will grab electricity
   from built-in solar panels and employ a rainwater collection system.
   Although it looks like the design could support a composting toilet to
   give it the most flexibility in terms of location, the prototype design
   has been configured to connect to a “small biological pit” (read:
   septic tank).

   Meanwhile, residents will be able to change their floor plan whenever
   they desire, which is unusual even in the market for innovative tiny
   homes. Movable interior walls can be used, for example, to partition a
   bedroom into two rooms when residents have guests over. In addition to
   the mechanical devices mentioned above, the initial design employs
   screens made of fabric and lightweight wooden walls to change the shape
   of the interior. The living room can also be partitioned or even
   transformed into a large outdoor platform that augments the terrace
   area.

   It has a total floorspace of just 27 square meters (about 290 square
   feet, for those of you who are fans of IKEA’s popular tiny house
   examples). That space includes two bedrooms including one with a double
   bed and one with a single, as well as a bathroom, kitchenette, terrace,
   and a living room, at least in the initial design.

   “Casa Ojalá is a sustainable, minimal, compact and flexible product for
   a new comfort, away from TV or air conditioning,” said IB Studio in its
   promotional materials. “The boundary between inner and outer space no
   longer exists. Outdoor is a substantial, fundamental and precious part
   of it.”

   IB Studio, led by Bonzanigo and partner Isabella Invernizzi, will
   showcase the installation called “Casa Ojalá / Inhabiting the Infinite
   Choice” at the Post Design Gallery Memphis Showroom. The company’s
   portfolio also includes a diverse array of innovative projects
   including a villa in Australia, stately homes in the Tuscan
   countryside, a prize-winning wine cellar in Tuscany, and a restaurant
   chain in Japan.

The best web browsers for 2019

Chrome is a fantastic browser, but is is still the best among new
competitors?

   By Mark Coppock August 20, 2019 10:30AM PST
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Picking a web browser isn’t like selecting an operating system or
   smartphone ecosystem. Unlike choosing MacOS, Windows, or Chrome OS,
   where your choices are mutually exclusive, switching between browsers
   isn’t quite so jarring. You could download any one of the major
   browsers on the market today in the time it takes you to finish reading
   this paragraph. But which is the fastest? Which is the safest and most
   private?

   To help you decide, we’ve broken down the best browsers on the market
   today and boiled them down to their bare bones. Even if some of them
   could do with being rebuilt from the ground up, these options are your
   best chance at a great online experience.

The best web browsers at a glance

     * The best web browser: Google Chrome
     * The best Chrome alternative: Mozilla Firefox
     * The most innovative browser: Opera
     * The web browser with the most potential: Microsoft Edge

The best web browser: Google Chrome

   Chrome is ubiquitous — and for good reason. With a robust feature set,
   full Google Account integration, a thriving extension ecosystem, and a
   reliable suite of mobile apps, it’s easy to see why Chrome is the gold
   standard for web browsers. Chrome even blocks some ads that don’t
   conform to accepted industry standards.

   Chrome also boasts some of the best mobile integration available. With
   a mobile app available on every major platform, it’s easy to keep your
   data in sync, making browsing between multiple devices a breeze. Sign
   into your Google account on one device, and all your Chrome bookmarks,
   saved data, and preferences come right along. Even which extensions are
   active stays in sync across devices. It’s a standard feature you can
   find on other platforms, but Chrome’s integration is second to none.

   Google released Chrome 69 to celebrate the browser’s 10th birthday with
   a significant visual redesign and some nice new features. The user
   interface was rounded and smoothed out, losing all of its previous
   sharper edges and harsh angles for a gentler and more attractive
   aesthetic. Tabs are easier to identify thanks to more visible favicons,
   making it perfect for anyone who typically keeps open a large number of
   tabs. Note that as of Chrome 71, you can no longer go back to the old
   interface.
   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   In addition, Chrome’s password manager now automatically generates and
   recommends strong passwords when a user creates a new account on a web
   page. The search bar, or Omnibox, now provides “rich results” comprised
   of useful answers to questions when they’re typed in, calculator
   results, sporting event scores, and more. Finally, favorites are now
   more accessible, and they’re now manageable on the New Tab page. Some
   of the more recent changes introduced in Chrome 74 include a dark mode
   that follows Windows 10’s theme settings and Incognito Detection
   Blocking so that sites can’t know that you’re running undercover.

   What’s the bottom line? Chrome is fast, free, light, and even
   better-looking. With a thriving extension ecosystem, it’s as fully
   featured or as pared down as you want it to be. Everything is right
   where it should be, privacy and security controls are laid out in plain
   English, and the browser just gets out of your way. If you’re not sure
   which browser you should be using, you should be using Chrome.

The best Chrome alternative: Mozilla Firefox

   Firefox comes in a close second — a very close second. Mozilla has been
   taking real strides in making its browser a truly modern way to surf
   from site to site, thanks to efforts like its upgrade to Firefox
   Quantum and the VR-focused alternative, Firefox Reality. It wasn’t too
   long ago that Mozilla’s rebuilt the familiar old standby browser’s UI
   from the ground up, offering a cleaner, more modern take on what a web
   browser should be, and even introduced a password-free browsing
   experience.

   The changes weren’t just skin deep, though. There’s some impressive
   engineering going on behind the scenes. Firefox Quantum is designed to
   leverage multicore processors in ways that its competitors just aren’t
   doing. It’s not going to make a huge difference in your day-to-day
   browsing, but the Mozilla Corporation hopes it’s going to give it an
   edge moving forward. By engineering for the future now, Firefox Quantum
   is in a better position to take advantage of quicker and quicker
   processors as they come out year after year.

   Beneath those changes, it’s still the same Firefox we all know and
   love. It’s a capable browser, with a deep catalog of extensions and
   user interface customization. The new Firefox Mobile app also received
   the Quantum treatment, so it’s quicker and more streamlined than ever
   before. Grab the mobile Firefox app and you’ll be able to share
   bookmarks between devices, but you’ll have to sign up for a separate
   Firefox account. Unfortunately, managing settings across platforms
   isn’t as seamless as it is in Chrome.

   Even with the recent overhaul, Firefox is a comfortable, familiar
   standby. There’s a bit of a fringe benefit, too. Because it’s been
   around longer than Chrome, some older web apps — the likes of which you
   might encounter at your university or workplace — work better on
   Firefox than they do on Chrome. For that reason, it never hurts to keep
   it around. And the most recent version, Firefox 68, does an even better
   job than ever of keeping you safe from sites that wan to track your
   activities as you surf the web.

   As a primary browser, Firefox doesn’t offer much that Chrome doesn’t,
   but its latest update is making it a very compelling alternative if
   you’re in the mood for something a little different.

The most innovative web browser: Opera

   Also a venerable browser and popular alternative, Opera shares much of
   Chrome’s DNA. Both browsers are built on Google’s Chromium engine, and
   as a result, they have a very similar user experience. Both feature a
   hybrid URL/search bar, and both are relatively light and fast.

   The differences appear when you start to look at Opera’s built-in
   features. Where Chrome relies on an extension ecosystem to provide
   functionality users might want, Opera has a few more features baked
   right into the browser itself. It also introduced a predictive website
   preload ability, and an Instant Search feature isolates search results
   in their own window while the current page fades into the background —
   letting users more easily focus on the research task at hand.

   As of Opera 55, you can also install the Chrome extension from the
   Chrome web store, meaning that not only can you run the same extensions
   as if you were using Chrome, but discovering and installing extensions
   is just as easy as on Google’s popular browser. If Chrome’s wide
   variety of extensions are important to you, then Opera becomes an
   intriguing alternative. With Opera 56, the browser was furthered
   refined, meaning that Opera might just be one of the best browsers for
   quickly navigating web pages.

   Opera also features a built-in “Stash” for saving pages to read later.
   There’s no need to sign up for a Pocket or Evernote account to save a
   page for later reading. Similarly, Opera features a speed-dial menu
   that puts all your most frequently visited pages in one place. Chrome
   also does this but only on a blank new tab. Finally, Opera has a
   built-in unlimited VPN service, making it a more secure option.

   But the biggest changes came with Opera 60 and Reborn 3, a complete
   revamp of the browser’s design that brought a new borderless design,
   Web 3 support, and a Crypto Wallet allowing users to prepare for
   blockchain-based sites. If you’re looking for a feature-packed browser
   that offers some serious privacy and security, then Opera is a great
   choice.

   You can see that we’re well into hair-splitting territory, which is why
   it’s important to remember that your choice of browser is, more than
   any other service or app you use on a daily basis, entirely dependent
   on your personal preferences — what feels most right for you. Opera has
   a unique look and feel, and it combines some of the best features of
   Firefox and Chrome.

The web browser with the most potential: Microsoft Edge

   Microsoft created its own new browser for Windows 10, dubbed Edge, that
   used its own browsing engine and was updated along with the operating
   system. That project was arguably a failure, as Edge failed to gain
   market share even though it was built into Windows 10 and set as the
   default browser.

   In response, Microsoft is rewriting Edge as a Chromium browser, taking
   Google’s lead and making something all its own. The new version is
   currently in beta, and while it bears a passing resemblance to the old
   Edge it’s a completely different browser inside.

   There’s really not much to say about the new Edge at this point. You
   can give one of the beta versions a try if you like, and the browser
   works well enough for simple browsing. There’s the ability to sync some
   — but not all —  settings across platforms, use a limited selection of
   Chrome extensions, and customize the browser in some limited ways.

   So, why are we focusing on the new version when it’s so limited? First,
   because let’s face it — there’s no reason to invest in a browser that’s
   being abandoned by its developer. Second, the new Edge has something
   the old one never did — it runs an all platforms, including MacOS,
   meaning that it’s a more feasible replacement for other browsers that
   haven’t been tied to Microsoft’s OS.

   If you’re looking for something a bit more experimental than Chrome or
   Firefox, just fire up the Edge Chromium beta and see what it can do.
   You might be surprised — or not. And Edge is now decoupled from Windows
   10, meaning it’s being updated more regularly.

Alternative browsers

   While the preceding browsers will meet most users’ needs, other
   alternatives exist for anyone who’s looking for something different.

Apple Safari

   If you run Apple platforms exclusively, then you might want to consider
   Safari if it’s not already your default choice. Safari might not be the
   fastest Mac browser around, with Chrome being significantly quicker,
   but it’s fast enough that you won’t feel too slowed down. And it’s the
   most integrated into MacOS, meaning you’re going to feel more at home
   and you’ll likely get better battery life thanks to some Mac-specific
   optimizations.

   Safari also focuses a great deal on privacy and security. If you want
   to minimize how you’re being tracked and whether Big Brother is looking
   over your shoulder, then Safari is a good choice. If you also use an
   iPhone and/or an iPad, then using Safari on your Mac will make for the
   most seamless transition between platforms.

Vivaldi

   Vivaldi is truly unique. No two Vivaldi users will have the same setup.
   When you run it for the first time, you’re guided through a setup
   process that lays out your browser in a way that makes sense for you.
   You get to choose where your tabs and address bar go, and you get to
   choose if you want browser tabs displayed at the top of the page or in
   a separate side panel. This is a browser built from the ground up to
   deliver a unique user experience, and for the most part, it succeeds.
   Vivaldi 2.0 enhanced the customization features and made them easier to
   access. We certainly enjoyed Vivaldi when we gave it a go.

   This browser excels at customization, and you can choose from a variety
   of tasteful themes that don’t feel dated or out of place on a modern
   PC, in addition to the aforementioned UI choices. It also has
   some stand-out privacy-enhancing features, like a recent team-up with
   DuckDuckGo, to make the non-tracking search tool the default option
   when in privacy mode. Finally, the latest version added more powerful
   tab management, enhancements like Web Panels that make for smarter
   browsing, and (as mentioned) even more powerful customization options.

Brave

   One of the most unusual browsers around is Brave — or, perhaps, its
   Brave’s business model that’s the strangest. Brave blocks all ads on
   all web pages by default, which makes it arguably the fastest browser
   around. Ads are a huge portion of how many web sites make money. Block
   ads and suddenly the most important web financial tool is eliminated.
   That’s where the Brave Rewards program will come in. Users will receive
   “Basic Attention Tokens,” or BATs, when they view alternative ads that
   Brave places in the browsing stream. The users can pass along a portion
   of their tokens to publishers. In the future, Brave hopes that
   publishers will jump on board and offer premium content in exchange for
   BATs.

   What’s in it for users? Simply put, if you’re not waiting for ads to
   download along with web site content, then your web experience is going
   to seem much faster. And, Brave performs no user tracking, making it a
   private browser as well.

Tor

   The Tor Browser is a version of Firefox that serves one very specific
   purpose. It provides a simple entry point for Tor (The Onion Router),
   which is software combined with an open network aimed at making you
   invisible by routing your traffic through a number of anonymous
   servers. While it’s not absolutely foolproof, it’s very difficult for
   someone to identify you when you’re properly configured and using
   something like the Tor Browser to surf the web. Especially if combined
   with a VPN.

   There are a number of legitimate uses of the Tor Browser and the Tor
   network, such as people who live in countries with repressive
   governments, as well as journalists and activists. The dark web is also
   one of the destinations for people using Tor, and that includes a
   number of nefarious and illegal sites. In any event, if you want to
   remain completely anonymous while you’re on the web, then the Tor
   Browser and network are for you.

Benchmark tests

   All right, so you’ve seen our recommendations — but if you still want
   to know more, check out our test results below.

   You’ll notice we dropped both Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari web
   browser from our comparison. Microsoft’s aging browser has had some
   improvements over the years, but it’s no longer the default browser on
   Windows 10, and it doesn’t offer much beyond the bare minimum. It only
   exists today because some companies need it for legacy applications.
   While Apple’s Safari web browser is still used by many Mac users, it’s
   no longer updated on Windows, and so we’ve removed it from the main
   list too.

   Most browsers are compatible with web standards and handle performance
   with relative ease. A casual user probably won’t notice a difference in
   the rendering speed between today’s modern browsers, as all six
   browsers are much faster and leaner than those of a few years ago.

   We ran the following benchmarks on a desktop with an Intel Core
   i7-4770K processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. All browsers were
   clean installs of the most current production versions as of early 2019
   and all were run at their default settings.

   We switched to the latest Jetstream 2 benchmark — which focuses on
   modern web applications — and Edge has retained it’s number one
   ranking. Although there’s a twist: The old Edge version wouldn’t
   complete the test, and so the winner is the Chromium version. Opera is
   in second place and Chrome is close behind, with Firefox coming in last
   place with a significantly lower score.

   Mozilla’s Kraken benchmark has Firefox in a strong first-place finish
   with Edge Chromium coming in second and Chrome in third. Opera comes in
   third and the old Edge finishes in dead-last.

   Interestingly, Chrome and Edge Chromium fell way behind in the HTML5
   compliance test. Opera comes in first and Firefox in second.

   Finally, we also tested how much RAM each browser uses, both with no
   tabs open and then with 10 tabs open accessing the same popular sites.
   We made sure that each browser had no extensions running, and we let
   each browser settle in before looking at its memory use. For the test
   with 10 tabs open, we averaged memory use when all of the tabs were
   first opened and then five minutes later, to account for any
   variability.

   It’s not a scientific test, but it should be sound enough to give an
   idea of which browsers are the most and least efficient in terms of
   taking up your RAM. We found Opera to use the least RAM both when first
   opened and Firefox used the least with all 10 tabs loaded. Chrome was
   much less efficient with multiple tabs opened with Edge Chromium was a
   solid performer in both instances.

Security and privacy

   The most valuable tool for secure browsing is user discretion,
   especially when you consider that every web browser has encountered
   security breaches in the past. In particular, Internet Explorer and
   Chrome’s reputation for protecting users’ security and privacy
   credentials is spotty at best.

   Chrome, Safari, Vivaldi, Opera, and Firefox all rely on Google’s Safe
   Browsing API to detect potentially dangerous sites. Thanks to constant
   updates, Mozilla, Chrome, and Opera all make constant security
   improvements.

   All browsers offer a private session option, too. Private sessions
   prevent the storage of history, temporary internet files, and cookies.
   Browser support for Do Not Track remains spotty, and it’s worth noting
   that a 2013 NSS study showed only Internet Explorer blocking trackers
   used on more than 90 percent of potentially hazardous sites.

   Mozilla has made some strides to try and differentiate itself from the
   others with a real focus on privacy in recent years. It even recently
   debuted a Facebook Container to make it harder for the social network
   to harvest a user’s information.

   Social Media

Take flight, social butterflies! This is the when and where of expert
updating

   By Jam Kotenko June 25, 2013 8:00AM PST
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   social media updating The wonderful world of social media is pretty
   much the digital version of real life, and for some of us that means
   posting something, somewhere at all hours of the day. In order to keep
   up with all the status updates, links, snapshots, and tweets, you need
   to maximize your time, and share efficiently – sending thoughts out
   into the ether won’t do anyone any good.

   Here’s a quick and easy how-to for you to follow so you can ensure all
   your posts on various social media sites get to the right people in a
   timely manner.

Know your topic and audience

   I know you have a lot of important thoughts in your head just waiting
   to be unleashed, but here’s a dose of reality: Not everyone will care
   about whatever it is that you have to say. However, each and every one
   of your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social sites
   will have a specific set of interests – if your post touches at least
   one of those interests, then it’s definitely worth posting.

   After knowing what it is you’re sharing, the next step would be to
   figure out who would be interested in it and what they do on a regular
   basis. Are your close friends all stay-at-home moms or freelancers who
   would have a lot of online time on their hands, or are they Average
   Joes and Janes who maintain 9-to-5 jobs in an office environment?
   Anticipating the type of activities your contacts engage everyday in
   will enable you to properly time your posts to reach the most number of
   people who will give a damn about your latest vacation or that
   thought-provoking article you just read. Otherwise, your update will
   get overlooked and sadly exist quietly without a Like or RT to its
   name.

Know your network and time your posts accordingly

   This is the most important step – the only step that matters, even.
   Knowing your audience is one thing, knowing the social network you
   intend to share to is quite another. Every person has a favorite site
   to go to for their dose of information overload, just like every social
   network has its own culture and user behavior. You need to study your
   friends list on every social site you have an account on and observe
   how your News Feed behaves on each one. Who posts most often on what
   site, and at what time of the day? What time zone do they follow?

   This step actually goes hand in hand with the previous one – aside from
   knowing where your friends are when they use Facebook, you also need to
   take note of your most social media-active friends so you can take
   advantage of their heightened online presence. It’s a good practice to
   tag people on posts you think will either appreciate it more than most
   (and comment on it) or find it interesting enough to pass it on to
   their other friends. Once they comment or re-post your update, there’s
   a higher chance that your post will get more social media airtime.

   Knowing where and what isn’t enough, you need to consider timing as
   well. According to various sources on the Internet, here are the best
   and worst times to post on the following popular social networks (all
   based on EST):
     * Facebook – Traffic on the god of all social networks is almost
       always atrociously high, but it’s most out of control between 9
       a.m. and 4 p.m. The best time to post that photo or link on
       Facebook would be between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., especially on
       Wednesdays at 3 p.m., when most people are perusing their feeds on
       their breaks. Don’t bother posting between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. –
       people will either be busy spending time with their families,
       engaging in offline activities, or sleeping. Posting on weekends is
       also generally discouraged because most people actually prefer to
       live life off the computer outside of work.

     * Twitter – Those who enjoy reading updates limited to 140 characters
       tend to do so from Monday to Thursday, after 11 a.m. The best time
       to post that Twitpic or RT is between 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., while the
       worst is from 8 p.m. to 9 a.m.. Traffic on the micro-blogging site
       starts to dwindle after 3 p.m., especially on a Friday, so try to
       get your tweet in before then.

     * LinkedIn – Linkedin is a social site mostly dominated by
       professionals with regular jobs, so of course it makes sense that
       traffic on this site is usually heavy before and after business
       hours, when users are not busy with their responsibilities – try to
       share posts between 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. or 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.. Anything
       you share between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. on a Monday or Friday will
       probably go under the radar.

     * Pinterest – This particular social network has a timing pattern
       that’s different from others – traffic tends to build up by 12
       noon. It’s advisable to pin posts on Pinterest any time between 2
       p.m. to 4 p.m. or 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays, but if you want to
       reach the most users, Saturday morning is your best bet, as it is
       the site’s peak time. Traffic dies down after 5 p.m., so try not to
       hold off on your pins till late afternoon.

     * Tumblr – Compared to Facebook and Twitter, Tumblr is a whole
       different creature when it comes to social media activity – you
       should consider posting on the site after 4.pm. If you really want
       to get the most attention, make sure you post after 7 p.m., when
       Tumblrers are most active. And unlike most sites that discourage
       posting on weekends, the best time to post on Tumblr is actually on
       a Friday night. Those kids and their crazy late night,
       weekend-Tumblring.

     * Google+ – Yes, contrary to popular belief, Google+ has enough
       traffic to have its own “peak time” for posts, which is after 9
       a.m. Unlike LinkedIn, the best time to post on Google+ is during
       work hours, specifically 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Traffic peters out after
       5 p.m., so don’t bother posting in the evenings.

Get extra serious

   If you are in a profession where social media presence matters a whole
   lot, then you might want to consider using social media tools that will
   give you better insight on how your audience behaves. This is also
   particularly useful for social sites that have don’t necessarily have a
   best time to post since it’s determined on a user-to-user basis, like
   Instagram.

   To track how many times your links are clicked, you can opt to use link
   shorteners like Bitly or Ow.ly. This will enable you to find out which
   social network you have the most reach in.

   If you want to maximize your social media accounts, there are special
   sites that offer a variety of services. SocialBro has a “best time to
   tweet” daily report that analyzes your Twitter followers’ timelines and
   lets you know the exact right moment you can reach the maximum number
   of people that will provide you with retweets and replies. Timing+ does
   the same for people who prefer using Google+. As for Instagram,
   Statigram will provide you a rolling month analysis of your account,
   analyze your usage, and show you a graph that will help you optimize
   your account.

This smart food dispenser lets you take your cat obsession to a whole new
level

   catspad is a smart food and water dispenser for cats with the app
   My cat has an automatic feeder that goes off at five in the morning, so
   he doesn’t come and attack my toes when he’s ready for his morning
   meal. But that doesn’t stop him from wanting the human touch, in the
   form of me pouring approximately 15 extra pieces of food into his bowl
   once I’m finally out of bed. While I can visually check the bowl to
   make sure the feeder is actually working every morning, there’s still
   some anxiety if I go away for the weekend. What if the batteries die
   when I’m gone? Catspad is a smart food and water dispenser for cats (or
   small dogs) that is supposed to let you check in on Lady McPet or Sir
   Pounce via your phone while you’re traveling — or just at the office.

   Because it holds 3.75 pounds (1.7 kilos) of food and just over 270
   ounces (8 liters) of water (enough for a month, according to its
   creators), the Catspad is kind of huge: 20 by 13 inches. Its domed
   shape is reminiscent of some litter boxes I’ve seen, so hopefully your
   cat won’t get confused. Like any automatic feeder, you can set the
   amount and frequency of food you’re doling out, and the water dispenser
   can either run continually or activate when your cat is near. (This may
   freak out skittish cats, though.) In addition, it uses weight and
   pressure sensors to alert you when supplies are running low.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/6yh7CAkF6rg?feature=oembed

   The feeder is also meant to work with an RFID chip in the accompanying
   collar. If you can get your cat to wear it, it will help track your
   cat’s nutrition. However, there’s no built-in camera, so you’ll have to
   rely on the app and food and water levels to ensure your cat is
   actually consuming the vittles and water. Presumably, this would also
   let you know that Fatty Bombatty is stealing all of Lil’ Bit’s food.

   The Catspad plugs into the wall but also has a battery backup. Right
   now, it’s available on Indiegogo for $179 and will eventually retail
   for $299. The designers hope to ship the units in December 2016, but
   the usual backer beware warnings apply. Also, you should apply an extra
   layer of wariness whenever cats are involved; my own refuses to drink
   from (ridiculously expensive) pet fountains.

The Loupedeck Plus custom keyboard will make you feel like a pro video editor

   If you can’t afford a new Mac Pro, but you’re a serious or aspiring
   video editor, there is a tool you can buy to speed up workflow on your
   existing Mac. It’s called the Loupedeck Plus, a $250 custom control
   interface with buttons, dials, and knobs for performing specific
   actions faster and more accurately than a mouse and keyboard. While
   it’s not technically new (nor limited to MacOS), it recently gained
   support for Apple’s Final Cut Pro X video-editing software.

   And it’s awesome. After using it for a couple of weeks, I don’t think I
   could go back to editing with just a mouse and keyboard.

   For experienced editors who already have a command of Final Cut Pro’s
   keyboard shortcuts, the Loupedeck will introduce a moderate learning
   curve that will make it feel less efficient at first. But once you
   adjust to it, you’ll find that navigating the Final Cut Pro interface,
   making basic edits, and adjusting color are all faster and more
   accurate.

   Perhaps more importantly, it simply makes the entire editing experience
   more enjoyable.

What is the Loupedeck?

   Launched on Indiegogo in 2016, the original Loupedeck surged past its
   $85,000 fundraising goal in just 48 hours and went on to raise over
   $400,000 total. At that time, it was billed solely as a photo-editing
   console for Adobe Lightroom. Loupedeck has since added support for many
   other programs and refreshed the hardware slightly with the new
   Loupedeck Plus. Final Cut Pro X is the most recent addition to the list
   of supported applications. (Note: The original Loupedeck does not
   support Final Cut Pro.)

   Bespoke hardware interfaces have been around for ages, but they haven’t
   exactly been affordable. Professional film editors and colorists — you
   know, the type of people who actually will buy the new Mac Pro — have
   long used setups from companies like Blackmagic Design that cost tens
   of thousands of dollars. This is why the Loupedeck Plus is so cool; it
   gives you a downsized version of those pro setups that can fit on your
   desk at home and doesn’t cost more than your car.

   But being designed foremost for Adobe Lightroom, the Loupedeck also
   lacks some refinement when it comes to using it with Final Cut Pro.
   First, the buttons and dials are labeled with Lightroom in mind. While
   some — like Temperature and Tint — perform the same function in Final
   Cut Pro as they do in Lightroom, others do not. Also, the eight wheels
   and three keys that control the hue, saturation, and luminance (HSL)
   panel in Lightroom serve no function at all in Final Cut Pro, and
   cannot be user-programmed to do anything.

   Despite this, I’m rather amazed by how well the Loupedeck interfaces
   with an application for which it wasn’t originally intended. There are
   some things that can be improved, and I personally wasn’t satisfied
   with the default control layout, but after spending a couple hours
   customizing it to my liking, I am very satisfied with the capabilities
   of this product. For YouTubers and enthusiast or professional editors
   without a big studio budget, the Loupedeck is absolutely worth a look.

Scrubbing clean

   The Loupedeck offers several ways to navigate the Final Cut Pro
   timeline. You can jump to the next and previous edit points using the
   Control Dial — the large main dial on the left of the panel — while the
   Clarity and D2 dials let you scrub in 1- and 10-frame increments,
   respectively. Holding the function button reverses the settings of the
   Clarity and D2 dials, so you can really just ignore one entirely.

   loupedeck plus final cut pro x hands on impressions 5

   Depending on how you edit, you’ll almost certainly want to take some
   time to remap the controls to match your style (you can see the default
   layout here). For example, I set the C5 and C6 buttons to select the
   trailing and leading edges of a clip, respectively, while I programmed
   the Saturation dial to perform 1-frame nudging, or multiframe nudging
   when holding the function button. This allowed me to quickly select and
   trim clips all with the controls located under my right hand, while my
   left used the Control Dial to navigate between edit points.

   Sure, there are keyboard shortcuts for doing this same thing, but they
   often require pressing multiple buttons simultaneously or are simply
   not conveniently located. And no button on a keyboard is as fast for
   scrubbing as rotating a dial.

   You can also use buttons on the Loupedeck to quickly move between
   different windows. Jump to the timeline with P1, the Library with P2,
   the Viewer with P3, and the Inspector with P4. I reprogrammed the
   entire row of P keys (eight in total) to show and hide Final Cut Pro’s
   various browsers and windows, and to toggle video scopes and the color
   board. Where I previously found myself constantly moving my right hand
   back and forth between the keyboard and mouse, now I hardly ever reach
   for the mouse. The few moments this saves here and there add up over
   time.

A rainbow of possibilities for color

   When Apple added back the three-way color wheels to Final Cut Pro X’s
   suite of color-correction tools, the app gained some much-needed
   coloring power. The Loupedeck Pus makes using color wheels even more
   accurate by giving you control over the individual red, green, and blue
   channels in the highlights, midtones, and shadows.

   loupedeck plus final cut pro x hands on impressions 9

   To enter color-correction mode, press the Custom Mode key on the
   Loupedeck. This dedicates three dials to each color wheel: The
   Contrast, Clarity, and Exposure dials control the shadows; Shadows,
   Highlights, and Whites control the midtones; and Temperature, Tint, and
   Saturation control the highlights. (Note, again, that the dials’ labels
   do not correspond to their actual function here.)

   Turning a dial moves the selector in the corresponding color wheel
   along a single color dimension. By using three dials in concert, you
   have full control over the entire range. You can also press a dial to
   reset the correction at any time. Additional dials can adjust the
   brightness of the highlights or darkness of the shadows, or you can
   hold the function key to make adjustments to the Master color wheel.

   I found that by having discrete dials for red, green, and blue, I was
   more accurate in my adjustments. This also just made me more thoughtful
   about my choices. Using a mouse to drag a selector around a color wheel
   may not really be any slower, but it is far less specific. Once you’ve
   grown comfortable with how the three-dial approach works, I think
   you’ll really like it.

   However, I found the lack of any functionality from the hue,
   saturation, and luminance wheels to be a real bummer. As it stands
   right now, there is no way to control the saturation slider for the
   highlights, shadows, and midtones independently — you can set master
   saturation, but that’s it. Being able to use the HSL controls could
   offer a solution to this problem.

   To be fair, I’m not sure if this particular issue is simply a
   limitation within Final Cut Pro itself. But if it is something that
   Loupedeck can fix, I’d love to see it.

That’s a wrap

   I’m ready to call the Loupedeck Plus a no-brainer investment for video
   editors, but there are some things to consider before buying. The most
   important thing to know is that it comes with a learning curve. If you
   plug it in and start using it right away on an editing job with a tight
   deadline, you will only be frustrated. Take the time to practice with
   it before you start using it for real work, and know that it may take a
   few hours to dial in the customization to a point where you’re fully
   comfortable with the controls.

   There are also some limitations of the driver. You can’t just program
   any button to any control. The dials, for example, all have a
   button-press function — but there’s no way to customize it, at least
   not to control anything within Final Cut Pro (the main Control Dial is
   the one exception here, which has myriad options for programming its
   button functionality). What’s more, you can’t simply program a
   Loupedeck key to a key on your keyboard or a keyboard shortcut; you can
   only select a function from a list of supported ones. There are many to
   choose from, but being able to assign a custom keystroke would be
   welcome.

   Overall, I’m very satisfied with the Loupedeck Plus. It brings
   improvements to both speed and accuracy, while also providing a more
   comfortable, more engaging way to edit video. Even if some of the
   Lightroom-specific functions and labels don’t transfer to Final Cut
   Pro, I still think it is priced fairly at $250. This is a great tool
   for video editors of all skill levels, and I’m pleased to see that its
   creators have continued to add functionality and support for more
   applications over time.

A Japanese A.I. program just wrote a short novel, and it almost won a
literary prize

   By Chloe Olewitz March 23, 2016 4:52PM PST
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Sergey Soldatov/123RF.comWhile many people in the world are worrying
   that robots will take over human jobs once artificial intelligence
   (A.I.) is fully developed, it’s a safe bet that no one put “author” at
   the top of the robot job list. Yet, now that a Japanese A.I. program
   has co-authored a short-form novel that passed the first round of
   screening for a national literary prize, it seems that no occupation is
   safe. The robot-written novel didn’t win the competition’s final prize,
   but who’s to say it won’t improve in its next attempt?

   The novel is actually called The Day A Computer Writes A Novel, or
   “Konpyuta ga shosetsu wo kaku hi” in Japanese. The meta-narrative
   wasn’t enough to win first prize at the third Nikkei Hoshi Shinichi
   Literary Award ceremony, but it did come close. Officially, the novel
   was written by a very human team that led the A.I. program’s
   development. Hitoshi Matsubara and his team at Future University
   Hakodate in Japan selected words and sentences, and set parameters for
   construction before letting the A.I. “write” the novel autonomously.
   One of the team’s two submissions to the competition made it past the
   first round of screening, despite a blind reading policy that prevents
   judges from knowing whether an A.I. was involved in the writing
   process.

   For the past few years, the Hoshi Shinichi Literary Award has
   technically been open to non-human applicants (specifically, “A.I.
   programs and others”). This year was the first time the award committee
   received submissions that were written by A.I. programs. All in all, 11
   out of the 1,450 submissions were written at least partially by
   non-humans. “I was surprised at the work because it was a
   well-structured novel. But there are still some problems [to overcome]
   to win the prize, such as character descriptions,” said Satoshi Hase, a
   Japanese science fiction novelist who was part of the press conference
   surrounding the award.

   Of course, many critics and supporters of developments in A.I. agree
   that one of the hardest obstacles for sentient robots to overcome will
   be some semblance of humanity. If A.I. bots can’t relate to humans, it
   will be hard for humans to relate to them. That may factor into the
   disappointing character development mentioned by very human novelist
   Hase. But Matsubara and his team aren’t deterred from the possibility
   of creativity within autonomous artificial intelligence. “So far, A.I.
   programs have often been used to solve problems that have answers, such
   as Go and shogi. In the future, I’d like to expand A.I.’s potential [so
   it resembles] human creativity,” Matsubara said.

This Italian-designed tiny home offers more transformations than meet the eye

   By Clayton Moore March 31, 2019 12:53PM PST
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   A new off-grid tiny home being showcased at this month’s Milan Design
   Week is a marvel of transformative design. Specifically, the
   “residential building with high flexibility,” as it has been designated
   by the Italian architectural firm who built it, has been built to use a
   mechanical system that employs cranks, ropes, and pulleys to
   reconfigure the tiny home on demand into twenty different layouts and
   variations.

   It’s named Casa Ojalá and it is the brainchild of architect Beatrice
   Bonzanigo of the Italian firm IB Studio, which plans to transport the
   new product into position by truck and then assemble it using its
   architectural team. Once in place, the tiny home will grab electricity
   from built-in solar panels and employ a rainwater collection system.
   Although it looks like the design could support a composting toilet to
   give it the most flexibility in terms of location, the prototype design
   has been configured to connect to a “small biological pit” (read:
   septic tank).

   Meanwhile, residents will be able to change their floor plan whenever
   they desire, which is unusual even in the market for innovative tiny
   homes. Movable interior walls can be used, for example, to partition a
   bedroom into two rooms when residents have guests over. In addition to
   the mechanical devices mentioned above, the initial design employs
   screens made of fabric and lightweight wooden walls to change the shape
   of the interior. The living room can also be partitioned or even
   transformed into a large outdoor platform that augments the terrace
   area.

   It has a total floorspace of just 27 square meters (about 290 square
   feet, for those of you who are fans of IKEA’s popular tiny house
   examples). That space includes two bedrooms including one with a double
   bed and one with a single, as well as a bathroom, kitchenette, terrace,
   and a living room, at least in the initial design.

   “Casa Ojalá is a sustainable, minimal, compact and flexible product for
   a new comfort, away from TV or air conditioning,” said IB Studio in its
   promotional materials. “The boundary between inner and outer space no
   longer exists. Outdoor is a substantial, fundamental and precious part
   of it.”

   IB Studio, led by Bonzanigo and partner Isabella Invernizzi, will
   showcase the installation called “Casa Ojalá / Inhabiting the Infinite
   Choice” at the Post Design Gallery Memphis Showroom. The company’s
   portfolio also includes a diverse array of innovative projects
   including a villa in Australia, stately homes in the Tuscan
   countryside, a prize-winning wine cellar in Tuscany, and a restaurant
   chain in Japan.

The best web browsers for 2019

Chrome is a fantastic browser, but is is still the best among new
competitors?

   By Mark Coppock August 20, 2019 10:30AM PST
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Picking a web browser isn’t like selecting an operating system or
   smartphone ecosystem. Unlike choosing MacOS, Windows, or Chrome OS,
   where your choices are mutually exclusive, switching between browsers
   isn’t quite so jarring. You could download any one of the major
   browsers on the market today in the time it takes you to finish reading
   this paragraph. But which is the fastest? Which is the safest and most
   private?

   To help you decide, we’ve broken down the best browsers on the market
   today and boiled them down to their bare bones. Even if some of them
   could do with being rebuilt from the ground up, these options are your
   best chance at a great online experience.

The best web browsers at a glance

     * The best web browser: Google Chrome
     * The best Chrome alternative: Mozilla Firefox
     * The most innovative browser: Opera
     * The web browser with the most potential: Microsoft Edge

The best web browser: Google Chrome

   Chrome is ubiquitous — and for good reason. With a robust feature set,
   full Google Account integration, a thriving extension ecosystem, and a
   reliable suite of mobile apps, it’s easy to see why Chrome is the gold
   standard for web browsers. Chrome even blocks some ads that don’t
   conform to accepted industry standards.

   Chrome also boasts some of the best mobile integration available. With
   a mobile app available on every major platform, it’s easy to keep your
   data in sync, making browsing between multiple devices a breeze. Sign
   into your Google account on one device, and all your Chrome bookmarks,
   saved data, and preferences come right along. Even which extensions are
   active stays in sync across devices. It’s a standard feature you can
   find on other platforms, but Chrome’s integration is second to none.

   Google released Chrome 69 to celebrate the browser’s 10th birthday with
   a significant visual redesign and some nice new features. The user
   interface was rounded and smoothed out, losing all of its previous
   sharper edges and harsh angles for a gentler and more attractive
   aesthetic. Tabs are easier to identify thanks to more visible favicons,
   making it perfect for anyone who typically keeps open a large number of
   tabs. Note that as of Chrome 71, you can no longer go back to the old
   interface.

   In addition, Chrome’s password manager now automatically generates and
   recommends strong passwords when a user creates a new account on a web
   page. The search bar, or Omnibox, now provides “rich results” comprised
   of useful answers to questions when they’re typed in, calculator
   results, sporting event scores, and more. Finally, favorites are now
   more accessible, and they’re now manageable on the New Tab page. Some
   of the more recent changes introduced in Chrome 74 include a dark mode
   that follows Windows 10’s theme settings and Incognito Detection
   Blocking so that sites can’t know that you’re running undercover.

   What’s the bottom line? Chrome is fast, free, light, and even
   better-looking. With a thriving extension ecosystem, it’s as fully
   featured or as pared down as you want it to be. Everything is right
   where it should be, privacy and security controls are laid out in plain
   English, and the browser just gets out of your way. If you’re not sure
   which browser you should be using, you should be using Chrome.

The best Chrome alternative: Mozilla Firefox

   Firefox comes in a close second — a very close second. Mozilla has been
   taking real strides in making its browser a truly modern way to surf
   from site to site, thanks to efforts like its upgrade to Firefox
   Quantum and the VR-focused alternative, Firefox Reality. It wasn’t too
   long ago that Mozilla’s rebuilt the familiar old standby browser’s UI
   from the ground up, offering a cleaner, more modern take on what a web
   browser should be, and even introduced a password-free browsing
   experience.

   The changes weren’t just skin deep, though. There’s some impressive
   engineering going on behind the scenes. Firefox Quantum is designed to
   leverage multicore processors in ways that its competitors just aren’t
   doing. It’s not going to make a huge difference in your day-to-day
   browsing, but the Mozilla Corporation hopes it’s going to give it an
   edge moving forward. By engineering for the future now, Firefox Quantum
   is in a better position to take advantage of quicker and quicker
   processors as they come out year after year.

   Beneath those changes, it’s still the same Firefox we all know and
   love. It’s a capable browser, with a deep catalog of extensions and
   user interface customization. The new Firefox Mobile app also received
   the Quantum treatment, so it’s quicker and more streamlined than ever
   before. Grab the mobile Firefox app and you’ll be able to share
   bookmarks between devices, but you’ll have to sign up for a separate
   Firefox account. Unfortunately, managing settings across platforms
   isn’t as seamless as it is in Chrome.

   Even with the recent overhaul, Firefox is a comfortable, familiar
   standby. There’s a bit of a fringe benefit, too. Because it’s been
   around longer than Chrome, some older web apps — the likes of which you
   might encounter at your university or workplace — work better on
   Firefox than they do on Chrome. For that reason, it never hurts to keep
   it around. And the most recent version, Firefox 68, does an even better
   job than ever of keeping you safe from sites that wan to track your
   activities as you surf the web.

   As a primary browser, Firefox doesn’t offer much that Chrome doesn’t,
   but its latest update is making it a very compelling alternative if
   you’re in the mood for something a little different.

The most innovative web browser: Opera

   Also a venerable browser and popular alternative, Opera shares much of
   Chrome’s DNA. Both browsers are built on Google’s Chromium engine, and
   as a result, they have a very similar user experience. Both feature a
   hybrid URL/search bar, and both are relatively light and fast.

   The differences appear when you start to look at Opera’s built-in
   features. Where Chrome relies on an extension ecosystem to provide
   functionality users might want, Opera has a few more features baked
   right into the browser itself. It also introduced a predictive website
   preload ability, and an Instant Search feature isolates search results
   in their own window while the current page fades into the background —
   letting users more easily focus on the research task at hand.

   As of Opera 55, you can also install the Chrome extension from the
   Chrome web store, meaning that not only can you run the same extensions
   as if you were using Chrome, but discovering and installing extensions
   is just as easy as on Google’s popular browser. If Chrome’s wide
   variety of extensions are important to you, then Opera becomes an
   intriguing alternative. With Opera 56, the browser was furthered
   refined, meaning that Opera might just be one of the best browsers for
   quickly navigating web pages.

   Opera also features a built-in “Stash” for saving pages to read later.
   There’s no need to sign up for a Pocket or Evernote account to save a
   page for later reading. Similarly, Opera features a speed-dial menu
   that puts all your most frequently visited pages in one place. Chrome
   also does this but only on a blank new tab. Finally, Opera has a
   built-in unlimited VPN service, making it a more secure option.

   But the biggest changes came with Opera 60 and Reborn 3, a complete
   revamp of the browser’s design that brought a new borderless design,
   Web 3 support, and a Crypto Wallet allowing users to prepare for
   blockchain-based sites. If you’re looking for a feature-packed browser
   that offers some serious privacy and security, then Opera is a great
   choice.

   You can see that we’re well into hair-splitting territory, which is why
   it’s important to remember that your choice of browser is, more than
   any other service or app you use on a daily basis, entirely dependent
   on your personal preferences — what feels most right for you. Opera has
   a unique look and feel, and it combines some of the best features of
   Firefox and Chrome.

The web browser with the most potential: Microsoft Edge

   Microsoft created its own new browser for Windows 10, dubbed Edge, that
   used its own browsing engine and was updated along with the operating
   system. That project was arguably a failure, as Edge failed to gain
   market share even though it was built into Windows 10 and set as the
   default browser.

   In response, Microsoft is rewriting Edge as a Chromium browser, taking
   Google’s lead and making something all its own. The new version is
   currently in beta, and while it bears a passing resemblance to the old
   Edge it’s a completely different browser inside.

   There’s really not much to say about the new Edge at this point. You
   can give one of the beta versions a try if you like, and the browser
   works well enough for simple browsing. There’s the ability to sync some
   — but not all —  settings across platforms, use a limited selection of
   Chrome extensions, and customize the browser in some limited ways.

   So, why are we focusing on the new version when it’s so limited? First,
   because let’s face it — there’s no reason to invest in a browser that’s
   being abandoned by its developer. Second, the new Edge has something
   the old one never did — it runs an all platforms, including MacOS,
   meaning that it’s a more feasible replacement for other browsers that
   haven’t been tied to Microsoft’s OS.

   If you’re looking for something a bit more experimental than Chrome or
   Firefox, just fire up the Edge Chromium beta and see what it can do.
   You might be surprised — or not. And Edge is now decoupled from Windows
   10, meaning it’s being updated more regularly.

Alternative browsers

   While the preceding browsers will meet most users’ needs, other
   alternatives exist for anyone who’s looking for something different.

Apple Safari

   If you run Apple platforms exclusively, then you might want to consider
   Safari if it’s not already your default choice. Safari might not be the
   fastest Mac browser around, with Chrome being significantly quicker,
   but it’s fast enough that you won’t feel too slowed down. And it’s the
   most integrated into MacOS, meaning you’re going to feel more at home
   and you’ll likely get better battery life thanks to some Mac-specific
   optimizations.

   Safari also focuses a great deal on privacy and security. If you want
   to minimize how you’re being tracked and whether Big Brother is looking
   over your shoulder, then Safari is a good choice. If you also use an
   iPhone and/or an iPad, then using Safari on your Mac will make for the
   most seamless transition between platforms.

Vivaldi

   Vivaldi is truly unique. No two Vivaldi users will have the same setup.
   When you run it for the first time, you’re guided through a setup
   process that lays out your browser in a way that makes sense for you.
   You get to choose where your tabs and address bar go, and you get to
   choose if you want browser tabs displayed at the top of the page or in
   a separate side panel. This is a browser built from the ground up to
   deliver a unique user experience, and for the most part, it succeeds.
   Vivaldi 2.0 enhanced the customization features and made them easier to
   access. We certainly enjoyed Vivaldi when we gave it a go.

   This browser excels at customization, and you can choose from a variety
   of tasteful themes that don’t feel dated or out of place on a modern
   PC, in addition to the aforementioned UI choices. It also has
   some stand-out privacy-enhancing features, like a recent team-up with
   DuckDuckGo, to make the non-tracking search tool the default option
   when in privacy mode. Finally, the latest version added more powerful
   tab management, enhancements like Web Panels that make for smarter
   browsing, and (as mentioned) even more powerful customization options.

Brave

   One of the most unusual browsers around is Brave — or, perhaps, its
   Brave’s business model that’s the strangest. Brave blocks all ads on
   all web pages by default, which makes it arguably the fastest browser
   around. Ads are a huge portion of how many web sites make money. Block
   ads and suddenly the most important web financial tool is eliminated.
   That’s where the Brave Rewards program will come in. Users will receive
   “Basic Attention Tokens,” or BATs, when they view alternative ads that
   Brave places in the browsing stream. The users can pass along a portion
   of their tokens to publishers. In the future, Brave hopes that
   publishers will jump on board and offer premium content in exchange for
   BATs.

   What’s in it for users? Simply put, if you’re not waiting for ads to
   download along with web site content, then your web experience is going
   to seem much faster. And, Brave performs no user tracking, making it a
   private browser as well.

Tor

   The Tor Browser is a version of Firefox that serves one very specific
   purpose. It provides a simple entry point for Tor (The Onion Router),
   which is software combined with an open network aimed at making you
   invisible by routing your traffic through a number of anonymous
   servers. While it’s not absolutely foolproof, it’s very difficult for
   someone to identify you when you’re properly configured and using
   something like the Tor Browser to surf the web. Especially if combined
   with a VPN.

   There are a number of legitimate uses of the Tor Browser and the Tor
   network, such as people who live in countries with repressive
   governments, as well as journalists and activists. The dark web is also
   one of the destinations for people using Tor, and that includes a
   number of nefarious and illegal sites. In any event, if you want to
   remain completely anonymous while you’re on the web, then the Tor
   Browser and network are for you.

Benchmark tests

   All right, so you’ve seen our recommendations — but if you still want
   to know more, check out our test results below.

   You’ll notice we dropped both Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari web
   browser from our comparison. Microsoft’s aging browser has had some
   improvements over the years, but it’s no longer the default browser on
   Windows 10, and it doesn’t offer much beyond the bare minimum. It only
   exists today because some companies need it for legacy applications.
   While Apple’s Safari web browser is still used by many Mac users, it’s
   no longer updated on Windows, and so we’ve removed it from the main
   list too.

   Most browsers are compatible with web standards and handle performance
   with relative ease. A casual user probably won’t notice a difference in
   the rendering speed between today’s modern browsers, as all six
   browsers are much faster and leaner than those of a few years ago.

   We ran the following benchmarks on a desktop with an Intel Core
   i7-4770K processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. All browsers were
   clean installs of the most current production versions as of early 2019
   and all were run at their default settings.

   We switched to the latest Jetstream 2 benchmark — which focuses on
   modern web applications — and Edge has retained it’s number one
   ranking. Although there’s a twist: The old Edge version wouldn’t
   complete the test, and so the winner is the Chromium version. Opera is
   in second place and Chrome is close behind, with Firefox coming in last
   place with a significantly lower score.

   Mozilla’s Kraken benchmark has Firefox in a strong first-place finish
   with Edge Chromium coming in second and Chrome in third. Opera comes in
   third and the old Edge finishes in dead-last.

   Interestingly, Chrome and Edge Chromium fell way behind in the HTML5
   compliance test. Opera comes in first and Firefox in second.

   Finally, we also tested how much RAM each browser uses, both with no
   tabs open and then with 10 tabs open accessing the same popular sites.
   We made sure that each browser had no extensions running, and we let
   each browser settle in before looking at its memory use. For the test
   with 10 tabs open, we averaged memory use when all of the tabs were
   first opened and then five minutes later, to account for any
   variability.

   It’s not a scientific test, but it should be sound enough to give an
   idea of which browsers are the most and least efficient in terms of
   taking up your RAM. We found Opera to use the least RAM both when first
   opened and Firefox used the least with all 10 tabs loaded. Chrome was
   much less efficient with multiple tabs opened with Edge Chromium was a
   solid performer in both instances.

Security and privacy

   The most valuable tool for secure browsing is user discretion,
   especially when you consider that every web browser has encountered
   security breaches in the past. In particular, Internet Explorer and
   Chrome’s reputation for protecting users’ security and privacy
   credentials is spotty at best.

   Chrome, Safari, Vivaldi, Opera, and Firefox all rely on Google’s Safe
   Browsing API to detect potentially dangerous sites. Thanks to constant
   updates, Mozilla, Chrome, and Opera all make constant security
   improvements.

   All browsers offer a private session option, too. Private sessions
   prevent the storage of history, temporary internet files, and cookies.
   Browser support for Do Not Track remains spotty, and it’s worth noting
   that a 2013 NSS study showed only Internet Explorer blocking trackers
   used on more than 90 percent of potentially hazardous sites.

   Mozilla has made some strides to try and differentiate itself from the
   others with a real focus on privacy in recent years. It even recently
   debuted a Facebook Container to make it harder for the social network
   to harvest a user’s information.
