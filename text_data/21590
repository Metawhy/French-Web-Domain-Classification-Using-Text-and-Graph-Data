   PLANT BASED TUNA.
   IT’S NOW A THING.

   SAVOR THE GENUINE
   SEAFOOD TASTE & TEXTURE

   MADE WITH PLANTS,
   MADE FOR EVERYONE

SEAFOOD WITHOUT SACRIFICE

   At Good Catch, we’re culinary rebels with a cause. We strive to help
   preserve the ocean’s natural resources while providing plant based
   protein options that have the rich flavors and flaky textures of fine
   seafood. This way, you can make delicious meals that are good for you
   and good for the planet.

   Where to Buy

SEAFOOD, EVOLVED

   Plant based tuna is now a thing. And soon, plant based burgers, sliders
   and crab cakes, and more – new protein-rich, nutrient-dense foods from
   Good Catch – will become a reality. We start with a proprietary blend
   of legumes and add farmed algal oil, which provides the clean taste of
   the sea, plus a nice dose of plant based omega-3s. The results?
   Delicious, and better for you, the oceans, and the creatures that live
   there.
