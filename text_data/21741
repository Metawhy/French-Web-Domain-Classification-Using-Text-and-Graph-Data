   What Is DMesh

   DMesh, designed by Dofl Y.H. Yun, is a custom creative application that
   turns images into techy artwork. It works by analyzing an image and
   generating a triangulation pattern for a beautiful finished product. To
   build the program, Dofl employed a groundbreaking mix of computer
   vision technologies to make DMesh for someone without any design
   background.

   Since its release, DMesh has taken the media by storm. It’s been
   featured in the Creative Applications Network, Creativity Magazine and
   Fastcodesign. Dofl continues to field requests from professional motion
   designers and 3D animations, and expects to continue adding features
   and adapting DMesh for the people who use it for a very long time.

   Key Features

   Auto Point Generation

   DMesh provides auto-generated points, which is useful for people doing
   animations or larger batches of images. Where other tools only allow
   manual use, DMesh analyzes the image, adds points and plays with the
   density accordingly while reducing noise in the mesh.

   Dynamic Mesh Density Control

   This allows users to control number of mesh dynamically so realistic
   result having more meshes or abstract one having less meshes can be
   made easily.

   Mesh Density Animation

   This feature is in testing. The next version update will include this
   feature.

   Manual Point Editing Tool

   Control the number of mesh points dynamically: add more for a realistic
   result, or subtract to make the image more abstract.

   Export as ...

   DMesh suports exporting images as bitmaps, vectors or 3D data for
   maximum flexibility and scope.

   Working with Sequenced Images

   Import/export sequenced images automatically, making it easier for
   motion designers. Video import/export is in the works.

   Computer Vision Technology

   Auto Point Generation is built based on computer vision technology so
   the results are closer to the original source and working with
   animation files can get more continuity between frames and less noise
   in the mesh.

   The table below shows each feature of DMesh, DMesh Pro and DMesh for
   iPhone. DMesh Pro goes beyond the basics to expertly handle animation:
   it loads, processes and exports sequenced images so the results can
   stand alone or as elements for additional work. Because it has a cost,
   Dofl uses it to target professional users and tries to continue adding
   the features they need.

   FAQ

   Q. I can't figure out how to zoom out through?

   A. The current version doesn't have zoom-in/out functions and display
   100% scale image. The reason why I did this way is for the performance.
   DMesh recommends using smaller than your screen resolution for tht
   reason and supports Vector format export to get high resolution image.
   Especially Pro version allows to control density of mesh so you can get
   same result below.

   High resolution + low density mesh = low resolution + high density mesh

   Q. DMesh on Mac crashes with each start or resizing window.

   A. DMesh uses Graphic card power to get best performance. Unfortunately
   some graphic cards on Macs would makes crash you already met. We
   strongly recommend to test DMesh (Free version) before buying Pro
   version to check if DMesh works properly on your system
