Caribbean and Guatemala

Learn more about our activities in the Caribbean and Guatemala.

Overview

   ExxonMobil’s activities in the Caribbean and Central America encompass
   the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, the Dominican Republic, the Cayman
   Islands, Guadeloupe, Guatemala and Martinique, with Esso offices
   located in each country. We have had a continuous business presence in
   this region for more than 95 years. Our primary activity in this region
   is downstream fuels (retail, industrial and wholesale, aviation and
   marine). On June 28, 2013, ExxonMobil and its affiliates signed
   agreements with Sol Investments Limited (Sol) for the sale of its
   downstream businesses in the Caribbean. This agreement excludes the
   lubricants & specialties business and includes a long term brand
   alliance for the retail business. Subject to regulatory approval, the
   change-in-control is anticipated to take place by the first half of
   2014.

   ExxonMobil is committed to investing in all the communities in which we
   operate. In the Caribbean and Guatemala we support community programs
   and activities primarily focused on health, pre-college and higher
   education. A key program in the region is the Help Us Help campaign. In
   some countries, this campaign occurs every year in association with our
   retailers. Funds raised are used to improve health conditions (diabetes
   and cancer-prevention programs) and for youth development and
   environmental programs.
