Shale Framework

   Shale is a modern web application framework, fundamentally based on
   JavaServer Faces. Architecturally, Shale is a set of loosely coupled
   services that can be combined as needed to meet particular application
   requirements. Shale provides additional functionality such as
   application event callbacks, dialogs with conversation-scoped state, a
   view technology called Clay, annotation-based functionality to reduce
   configuration requirements and support for remoting. Shale also
   provides integration links for other frameworks, to ease development
   when combinations of technologies are required.

Shale Features

   The major features of the Shale Framework are described in the
   following detail sections:
     * View Controller - Convenient mechanism to associate a "backing"
       Java class with each JavaServer Faces view in an application, with
       predefined event handlers for events significant to an application
       developer.
     * Dialog Manager - Mechanism to define a "conversation" with a user
       that requires multiple HTTP requests to implement, modeled as a
       state diagram.
     * Application Manager - Traditional application wide front controller
       features that should be applied to every request.
     * Validation - Integration with the Apache Commons Validator
       Framework, supporting both client side and server side validations
       based on a single set of configured validation rules.
     * Remoting - Server side support for applications that employ AJAX
       (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) style interactions.
     * Spring Integration - Integration with the Spring Framework,
       allowing the use of Spring's dependency injection framework to
       create JavaServer Faces managed beans.
     * Clay - An alternative to JSP where you define views in pure HTML,
       in a fashion similar to Tapestry and Facelets. An innovative
       sub-framework for supporting the configuration of reusable subtrees
       of JavaServer Faces components for customizable reuse.
     * Test Framework - Set of mock objects and JUnit test case base
       classes suitable for testing both the framework classes themselves,
       as well as application components built on top of the framework.
     * Tiger Extensions - Optional add-on library that adds additional
       ease-of-use features for Shale applications that run on Java
       Standard Edition 5 (popularly known by its code name during
       development, "tiger").

Shale Foundations

   Shale is based on (and requires a runtime environment that supports)
   the following foundation technologies:
     * Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.4 or later.
     * Servlet API 2.4 or later.
     * JavaServer Pages 2.0 or later.
     * JavaServer Faces 1.1 or later.
     * JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) 1.1 or later.
     * Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.7 or later.
     * Apache Commons Chain 1.1 or later.
     * Apache Commons Digester 1.8 or later.
     * Apache Commons Logging 1.1 or later.

   Various optional Shale components have dependencies on the following
   additional runtime technologies:
     * Apache Commons Validator 1.3.1 or later.
     * Apache Commons SCXML 0.6 or later.
     * Spring Framework 1.2.8 or later.
     * Cargo
     * jMock

   If you wish to work on Shale itself, you will require the following
   additional resources:
     * Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.4 or later. (JDK 1.5 is required for
       Shale Tiger.)
     * Apache Maven 2.0.4 or later.

Shale Download

   Shale 1.0.4 is available at
   http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/shale/. The release notes describe
   the most recent changes. The code signing key can be verified using the
   KEYS file at http://www.apache.org/dist/shale/KEYS

   The previous build (version 1.0.3) is available here with release notes
   here.

   Nightly builds of Shale are available from
   http://people.apache.org/builds/shale/nightly/. For convenience, the
   nightly builds include the following packages:
     * shale-framework-YYYYMMDD.{tar.gz,zip} - The binary and source
       download of the framework itself, including its dependencies.
     * shale-XXXXXXXX-YYYYMMDD.{tar.gz,zip} - A distribution containing
       source code and a web application archive for each example
       application that is available. Currently, the available examples
       are: shale-blank, shale-clay-usecases, shale-mailreader,
       shale-sql-browser, and shale-usecases.

   Snapshots of Shale are also available in Maven repositories. The group
