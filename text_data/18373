Description

   Product description

   Minecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people
   built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game
   grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.

   It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise
   over a blocky ocean. It’s pretty. Brave players battle terrible things
   in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a
   land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea.


   To download the latest version of Minecraft, you create an account on
   the website Minecraft.net - for free. With the Minecraft Gift Code you
   wil get the full version of Minecraft.

GTA Online: Arena War

   GTA Online: Arena War

   Welcome to a new era of entertainment. Time to sit down, strap in, and
   battle other would-be opponents in the greatest orgy of sports and
   automotive gladiatorial combat in human history.

   The most deranged vehicles! The most brutal weapons! The biggest
   crowds!

   Run your own workshop, craft your own juggernauts of destruction, and
   track your own carnage-filled career. Live from the Maze Bank Arena,
   this is Arena War.

About the game

   When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying
   psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening
   and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government
   and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of
   dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust
   nobody, least of all each other.

   Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the
   award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine County in resolutions of
   up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game
   running at 60 frames per second.

   The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization
   options, including over 25 separate configurable settings for texture
   quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as
   support and extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls.
   Additional options include a population density slider to control car
   and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D
   compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support.

   Grand Theft Auto V also comes with Grand Theft Auto Online, the dynamic
   and ever-evolving online universe for up to 30 players, and includes
   all existing gameplay upgrades and content released since the launch of
   Grand Theft Auto Online. Rise through the ranks to become a CEO of your
   own criminal empire by trading contraband or form a Motorcycle Club and
   rule the streets. Pull off daring co-operative Heists, enter
   adrenaline-fueled Stunt Races, compete in unique Adversary Modes or
   create your own content to play and share with the entire GTA
   community.

   The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online
   features First Person Mode, giving players the chance to explore the
   incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an
   entirely new way.

   Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor,
   a powerful suite of creative tools to quickly and easily capture, edit
   and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft
   Auto Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the
   ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters,
   pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with
   advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and
   slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own
   music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the
   intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded
   directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games
   Social Club for easy sharing.

   Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new
   radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music
   from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original
   soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt,
   Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam Herring from Future
   Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine
   County while enjoying their own music through Self Radio, a new radio
   station that will host player-created custom soundtracks.
