   Buyer Select Home Decor & Decorating Ideas

CURATED HOME DECOR, FASHION & LIFESTYLE MAGAZINE

   With over 9,200,000 Pinterest Monthly Viewers, Buyer Select is a highly
   recognized and trusted source for home décor, bedding, fashion and
   lifestyle inspirations.

   Glam, Modern Rustic, Scandinavian Decor, Tonal Chic or Urban Earthy
   Modern Glam Decor

   Modern Glam

   Looking for modern glam decor? Find all the essentials for a polished
   pad of your own where luxe classics meet fashion edge. From animals
   prints to sparkling chandeliers, classic furnishings, pretty pastels,
   global patterns, and glamorous gold accents. Clean lines and luxe
   details and a healthy dose of shine create a space that’s glamorous yet
   easy going. Say “yes” to shimmer with chrome, nickel and white gold.
   It’s glam, fun and slightly daring – and these items are all spot-on
   for creating a space that’s ladylike with an edge. [Shop Modern Glam ]
   Tonal Chic Decor

   Tonal Chic

   Create a modern tonal chic decor style by using one or two colors or by
   layering pale neutral shades of toffee, cream, and caramel. A modern
   feel can be achieved by incorporating a tonal palette enhanced with
   reflective surface treatments such as gleaming hints of brass or silver
   that catch the light. These clean lines don’t need to be cold and
   minimalistic – add layers of earthy organic pieces, lush layers, and
   contemporary pieces. [Shop Tonal Chic]
   Farmhouse Decor

   Farmhouse Decor

   Farmhouse decor and decorating style reflect a slower, more relaxed
   pace of life in the country. Farmhouse decorating is all about
   simplicity and keeping things organic. The finer details matter with
   this approach, and it works best when elements incorporated portray a
   rustic, minimal and cozy feel. Think exposed beams overhead, distressed
   woods, natural textures, floral curtains, vintage and whitewashed
   decor, a neutral color palette, galvanized metal accents, salvaged
   goods and implementing raw and organic materials in the foundation.
