My Dad (the Chef) Told Me Not to Bother With Food Processors—But He Was Wrong

   An immersion blender just won't cut it sometimes.

   My hummus was chunky. Not in a charmingly textured sort of way. In a
   more-like-mushy-chickpeas-than-hummus sort of way. I could tell that
   the NutriBullet I was using was, first of all, too small, and, second,
   completely sealed at the top, which kept me from slowly streaming in
   olive oil as I pulsed through the chickpeas. I wanted a swirling vortex
   that pulled in any unblended pieces, but I had oily soup beneath the
   blades and entirely untouched legumes above. It took several rounds of
   stopping and scraping, but I finally reached something hummus-adjacent.
   Still, I knew there had to be a better way.

   Like most city apartment dwellers, my kitchen is small. I try to limit
   my appliances to a small, space-saving blender and a toaster. In my
   house, whipped cream comes together by good ol’ wrist strength, as does
   cookie dough. But increasingly, it seemed like there was one appliance
   I couldn’t replace with my own willpower and brute force: a food
   processor.

   As I often do when I have a kitchen question, I texted my dad, a chef
   and restaurateur, to ask which brand of food processor he had at home
   so I could get a similar one.

   “I don’t have one,” he responded.

   “But what if you need to make hummus? Or breadcrumbs? Or turn sugar
   into superfine sugar???” I typed.

   “I don’t,” he texted back.

   Upon further interrogation, his stance became slightly more clear: if a
   recipe calls for the fine chopping of a food processor, he’ll either do
   it by hand or make something else.

   And that was that.

   Or so I thought, until a package arrived at my apartment a few days
   later, containing an immersion blender and a note stating it was from
   my dad. A food processor, it seemed, was unnecessary, but he felt than
   an immersion blender deserved a spot in my tiny kitchen arsenal.

   Back in the office, I asked senior food editor Anna Stockwell if she
   felt that my new tool could solve all of my food-processing problems.

   “I love using my food processor for cutting butter into pie dough,” she
   said. “Really, making any dough is easier in a food processor.” That's
   definitely something an immersion blender can’t do, since blenders
   perform best when there’s a lot of liquid involved. Since the
   processor's blades are super-sharp, they can easily slice through
   onions, or grind through nuts and seeds to make almond or sunflower
   butter. And special disks on the processor make shredding potatoes and
   carrots a snap. Finally, Anna said that she prefers making hummus (!)
   in her food processor because you can leave it running and go about
   your business, unlike an immersion blender that you’ll need to hold
   onto.

   I wanted to put my immersion blender to the test, but the obvious first
   use was a pot of creamy soup, and it was still too hot in my kitchen to
   even think about roasting squash. Inspiration struck in the bulk bins
   of Whole Foods: I scored some pine nuts and tried my hand at pesto.

   The immersion blender...sort of worked. At first I had a paste of pine
   nuts stuck beneath the cupped blade and the blender struggled to
   incorporate the basil and parmesan. I added olive oil until the sauce
   reached a consistency the blades could churn through better and,
   eventually, my handfuls of basil became a sauce I could toss into
   linguine. Would a food processor have worked better? Probably. I
   quickly realized though that the immersion blender takes almost no time
   to clean, and, once I finally took it out of the box, requires very
   little drawer space to store.

   Perhaps the most unanticipated side effect of the immersion blender is
   that it has given me the ability to see my future. My fall and winter
   will be full of aioli, homemade salad dressing, and freshly made soups,
   but—for now at least—no hummus.
