A day alone at the sea

   January 25, 2017
   |In Culture, Lifestyle
   |By tom

   Just the other day I happened to wake up early. That is unusual for an
   engineering student. After a long time I could witness the sunrise. I
   could feel the sun rays falling on my body. Usual morning is followed
   by hustle to make it to college on time. This morning was just another
   morning yet seemed different.

   Witnessing calm and quiet atmosphere, clear and fresh air seemed like a
   miracle to me. I wanted this time to last longer since I was not sure
   if I would be able to witness it again, knowing my habit of succumbing
   to schedule. There was this unusual serenity that comforted my mind. It
   dawned on me, how distant I had been from nature. Standing near the
   compound’s gate, feeling the moistness that the air carried, I thought
   about my life so far.

   I was good at academics, so decisions of my life had been pretty simple
   and straight. Being pretty confident I would make it to the best junior
   college of my town in the first round itself, never made me consider
   any other option. I loved psychology since childhood, but engineering
   was the safest option. Being born in a middle class family, thinking of
   risking your career to make it to medical field was not sane. I grew up
   hearing ‘Only doctor’s children can afford that field’ and finally
   ended up believing it. No one around me believed in taking risks.
   Everyone worshiped security. I grew up doing the same.

   ‘Being in the top will only grant you a good life’ has been the mantra
   of my life. But at times, I wish I was an average student. I wish
   decisions would have not been so straightforward. Maybe I would have
   played cricket- the only thing I feel passionate about. Or maybe I
   would have studied literature (literature drives me crazy). Isn’t that
   disappointing- me wishing to be bad at academics. It’s like at times I
   hate myself for the stuff I am good at.

     This is what has happened to us. We want the things we have been
     doing forcefully to fail. And then maybe people around us would let
     us try something else or our dreams. We are accustomed to live by
     everyone else’s definition of success. We punish people for the
     things they are passionate about, just because we were unable to do
     the same at some point in our life.

   I feel like these concrete buildings have sucked our desires and our
   dreams. We are so used to comfort that compromise seems like a taboo.
   We have lost faith in ourselves. If we can make through it right now,
   we can do the same in the days to come. You only need a desire to
   survive and nothing more- not money or cars or designer clothes.

   Staying locked up in four walls have restricted our thinking. I feel
   like our limited thinking echoes through this wall. We are so used to
   schedules and predictable life that we have successfully suppressed our
   creative side.

   When you step out of these four walls on a peaceful morning, you
   realize how much nature has to offer to you. Its boundless. Your
   thoughts, worries, deadlines won’t resonate here. Everything will flow
   away along with the wind. And you will realize every answer you had
   been looking for, was always known to you.

   It would mean a lot to me if you recommend this article and help me
   improve. I would love to know your thoughts!
   Enjoy Tech Travel

   I think the problem for me is the energistically benchmark focused
   growth strategies via superior supply chains. Compellingly
   reintermediate mission-critical potentialities whereas cross functional
   scenarios. Phosfluorescently re-engineer distributed processes without
   standardized supply chains. Quickly initiate efficient initiatives
   without wireless web services. Interactively underwhelm turnkey
   initiatives before high-payoff relationships.

Some amazing buildings

Minimalism and geometric.

   When you are alone for days or weeks at a time, you eventually become
   drawn to people. Talking to randos is the norm. I’ll never forget the
   conversation with the aquarium fisherman, forest ranger, and women at
   the Thai market. It’s refreshing to compare notes on life with people
   from vastly different backgrounds.

   When you meet fellow travelers, you’ll find they are also filled with a
   similar sense of adventure and curiosity about the world. Five days of
   friendship on the road is like five months of friendship at home. It’s
   the experiences that bond you together, not the place. A rule I
   followed that worked well: be the first to initiate conversation. I met
   some incredible people by simply being the first to talk.

   Long term travel is different than a luxury vacation. The point is to
   see the world, not stay in a 5-star hotel. During the trip, I stayed on
   a strict budget. The goal was to spend no more than $33 per day on
   accommodations. After a year, I was able to spend only $26.15 per day
   by booking through HostelWorld and Airbnb. When I wanted to meet
   people, I’d stay in a shared room at a hostel. When I wanted to be
   alone, I’d book a private room with Airbnb.

   Take the cost of your rent or mortgage + food per month and divide it
   by 30. This is how much it costs per day to live at home. You will find
   that it’s possible to travel the world for roughly the same amount. Or,
   if you live in an expensive city like San Francisco, far less.

An universal language.

   I was surprised how many people spoke English (apparently 1.8 billion
   people worldwide). Places where English was less prevalent, I made an
   effort to learn a handful of words and phrases in the local language.
   Even though it’s passable, I do desire to learn another language
   fluently. You can only take the conversation so far when all you can
   say is: “¿Esto contiene gluten?”

   It’s possible to communicate a lot without saying a word. For instance,
   I left my phone at a restaurant in Chile. I pointed at the table where
   I was sitting, put my hand to my ear like a phone, then shrugged — 2
   minutes later, my phone had been retrieved.

   Many years ago, I worked for my parents who own a video production
   company. Because it is a family business, you inevitably end up wearing
   many hats and being the czar of many different jobs. I mainly managed
   projects and worked as a video editor. On production, there were times
   that I was called on to work as an audio tech and was made to wear
   headphones on long production days. In those days, having a really good
   set of headphones that picked up every nuance of sound was essential to
   making sure the client got what they needed.

First impressions.

   Naturally, my first impression of these headphones is based off of the
   look of them. They have a classic over-the-ear style that is
   highlighted by a blue LED light that indicates the power for the noise
   canceling. The padding on the ear pieces seems adequate for extended
   usage periods.
   They are wired headphones, but the 3.5mm stereo mini-plug cable is
   detachable. Something else I noticed right of the bat was the very nice
   carrying case that comes with them. It has a hard plastic exterior with
   a soft cloth interior that helps to protect the surface of the
   headphones from scratches. I never truly appreciated cases for
   headphones until I started carrying them from place-to-place. Now I
   can’t imagine not having a case.

A perfect fit.

   Once I gave the headphones a thorough once-over exam, I tried them on.
   As I mentioned, they have a classic over-the-ear style and just looking
   at them, the padding on the ear pieces seem adequate and the peak of
   the headband seemed to be a bit lacking, but you don’t really know
   comfort unless you try on the product. So, I slipped the headphones on
   and found them to be exquisitely comfortable.

     It’s safe to say that because of my unique professional experiences,
     I’ve tested out a lot of headphones.

Quality.

   Now that I had the headphones on my head, I was finally ready to plug
   and play some music. I plugged the provided cable into the jack on the
   headphones and then the one on my iPhone 6. Then I called up Pandora. I
   tend to have a very eclectic music purview and have many stations set
   up for different moods. From John Williams to Fallout Boy, the sound
   quality of these headphones was remarkable. There is an amazing depth
   of sound and incredible highs and lows that make listening to music a
   truly breathtaking experience.

   In order to test how voices sounded, and the overall art of sound
   mixing, I pulled up Netflix on my iPad Air 2 and watched a few minutes
   of a movie to hear all the nuances of the film. None of them were lost.
   In fact, I ended up hearing sounds that I hadn’t heard before.
   Echoes…birds chirping…wind blowing through trees…breathing of the
   characters…it was very impressive what the headphones ended up bringing
   out for me.

   I would highly recommend these to any sound mixing specialist.
