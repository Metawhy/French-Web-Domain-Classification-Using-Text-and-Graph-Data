   Model Driven Engineering open-source platform for Real-Time & Embedded
   systems

   OpenEmbeDD is an Eclipse-based  "Model Driven Engineering" platform
   dedicated to Embedded and Real-Time systems (E/RT).

   Its aim is to offer engineers who design and develop E/RT software the
   means to express, simulate, validate and test the targeted system
   before any component has been solded on a circuit board.
