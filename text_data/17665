Prosciutto-Wrapped Melon with Basil

   November 19, 2017 By Erin Leave a Comment

   Melon-Wrapped Prosciutto with Basil – that easy and delicious holiday
   appetizer you are looking for!

   It is officially the holiday season and healthy appetizers are not
   always easy to find!  This Prosciutto-Wrapped Melon with Basil is
   Whole30 compliant and absolutely delicious!

   This weekend was my first of two Thanksgiving Dinners ?. We are
   spending actual Thanksgiving with my in-laws, so my Mom came down for
   the weekend to celebrate Thanksgiving together.  I was in heaven.
   Cooking Thanksgiving Dinner in my own house right next to my Mom.  It
   was amazing.

   I love how every family has their own personal Thanksgiving menu.
   Sure, a new item might pop in once in a great while, but I think for a
   lot of people, those Thanksgiving traditions are just steeped in
   tradition and I freaking love it.  It doesn’t matter if it is healthy
   or “cool” – it is literally about the fact that you have helped cook
   and eaten that recipe on Thanksgiving every year for your entire life.
    You probably don’t even eat these recipes any other day except for
   Thanksgiving (ahem – my Mom’s stuffing).  It is a meal that is filling
   both emotionally and physically.  It is one of my most favorite days.

   So, while the dinner is incredibly indulgent and savory and DELICIOUS …
   people still expect (and need) some amazing apps beforehand (especially
   if you eat a later Thanksgiving Dinner like we typically do).  It is
   always nice to serve a mix of healthy and maybe not-so-healthy
   appetizers for people to choose from.

   This recipe is for one of my absolute favorite go-to healthy appetizers
   that is ALWAYS a hit (so is this one).  So, so simple and delicious.

   I hope you guys are having fun finalizing your menus and I can’t wait
   to enjoy my second Thanksgiving dinner ?. Have an awesome (short) week!

Description

   That easy and delicious holiday appetizer you are looking for!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Scale (BUTTON) 1x (BUTTON) 2x (BUTTON) 3x

Ingredients

     * 1 ripe cantaloupe
     * 2 packages of prosciutto
     * approximately 2 cups fresh basil leaves
     * toothpicks
     __________________________________________________________________

Instructions

    1. Cut cantaloupe into small squares.
    2. Take a piece of prosciutto and cut it in half lengthwise and across
       so it is in quarters.
    3. Take a piece of cantaloupe and wrap it in prosciutto.
    4. Place a folded basil leaf on top and then push toothpick in to hold
       all together.
    5. Note: how many individual appetizers this makes is entirely
       dependent upon how big your melon squares are. If you cut the melon
       too big, you will need a whole half of a prosciutto slice to fully
       wrap the square. Plan accordingly.
