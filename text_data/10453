   Policy brief

   This policy brief considers the lack of European Works Councils through
   a Belgian perspective. It discusses Belgian companies who are currently
   engaged in establishing one or have developed ‘functionally equivalent’
   structures. The remaining companies are confronted with serious
   obstacles to establishing a European Works Council, principally: (i) a
   lack of knowledge about them, (ii) weak and time-consuming
   national-level information...

   This Working Paper analyses the development of the interpretation that
   the European Commission has given to the TFEU provision concerning
   mechanisms for extensions of collective agreements. The paper examines
   how the Commission has reinterpreted these provision and the challenges
   this poses for the social partners.

   This working paper provides data confirming that workers in
   lower-skilled health and social care assistant positions earn
   considerably less than the national average wage in their country.

   The policy brief examines the low unionisation rate among Deliveroo
   riders that seems to be partly due to a lack of organising initiatives
   and strategies on the part of trade unions.

   This collection of four volumes charts the development of collective
   bargaining since the year 2000 in the 28 EU Member States. These four
   volumes document how the institutions of collective bargaining have
   been removed, fundamentally altered or markedly narrowed in scope in
   all 28 EU Member States.

   This policy brief details the necessary amounts for dignified living
   according to official EU figures and the perceptions of Europeans, as
   well as the actual disposable income of families in the lower part of
   the income distribution across EU member states. The research shows
   that households not being able to fulfil their needs is not just a
   question of their relative income but in some countries reflects the
   general low level of wa...

Transfer: everything you always wanted to know about the living wage

   30 September 2019

   In July 2019, Ursula von der Leyen, candidate for the European
   Commission President declared in her ‘Agenda for Europe’: “The dignity
   of work is sacred. Within the first 100 days of my mandate, I will
   propose a legal instrument to ensure that every worker in our Union has
   a fair minimum wage. This should allow for a decent living wherever
   they work.”

66% of employees pushed to work “very fast”

   24 September 2019

   The results of the SUMER 2017 survey were presented in France on 9
   September 2019. SUMER is the acronym for the French “surveillance
   médicale des salariés aux risques professionnels”, i.e. the medical
   monitoring of employees’ exposure to occupational risks. Carried out
   for the 4th time, the survey maps the main work-related risks. The
   previous surveys were performed in 1994, 2003 and 2010 in such a way
   that a comparison of the results provides important information on the
   evolution of working conditions in France over a period of more than 20
   years.

High levels of endocrine disruptors found among children

   10 September 2019

   Hundreds of substances capable of disrupting hormone production exist.
   Used to a massive extent by industry in many different products, these
   substances are linked to serious health problems such as cancers,
   reproductive health disorders, developmental disorders such as obesity,
   lower intelligence quotients, etc. The main substances used include
   bisphenols, phthalates, parabens, glycol ethers, brominated flame
   retardants and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). For the first time, the
   French public health agency Santé publique France has measured the
   presence of these substances of very high concern (SVHCs) in the bodies
   of children and adults in a large sample (1,104 children and 2,503
   adults) representative of the French population. The work was carried
   out in the context of the ESTEBAN (enquête de santé sur
   l’environnement, la biosurveillance, l’activité physique et la
   nutrition) public health survey.
