   What is Caml?
   Caml is a general-purpose programming language, designed with program
   safety and reliability in mind. It is very expressive, yet easy to
   learn and use. Caml supports functional, imperative, and
   object-oriented programming styles. It has been developed and
   distributed by INRIA, a French research institute in computer science
   and applied mathematics, since 1985.

   OCaml
   The OCaml system is the main implementation of the Caml language. It
   features a powerful module system and a full-fledged object-oriented
   layer. It comes with a native-code compiler that supports numerous
   architectures, for high performance; a bytecode compiler, for increased
   portability; and an interactive loop, for experimentation and rapid
   development.

   Caml Light
   The Caml Light system is an older, lightweight implementation of the
   core Caml language. It is obsolete, no longer actively maintained, and
   will be removed eventually. We recommend switching immediately to its
   successor, OCaml.

   Resources for Caml Users
   In addition to the official distribution of the Caml compilers, this
   site provides a collection of online resources that are useful to Caml
   users, from beginners to expert programmers. Most of them were
   contributed by the very active community of Caml programmers.
