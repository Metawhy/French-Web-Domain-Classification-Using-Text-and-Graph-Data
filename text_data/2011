Sustainable development: two indices, two different views

   20 July 2016 Blog

   It’s been a busy day for launching new country rankings. Today (July
   20), the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released a
   427-page report ranking countries by 77 indicators tied to the 17 UN
   Sustainable Development Goals approved last year. The SDG index
   averages countries’ performance on those goals. Each goal is assessed
   by a mélange of indicators, including poverty and obesity rate, traffic
   deaths, literacy rate, seats held by women in national parliament,
   access to water and electricity, unemployment, mobile broadband
   subscriptions, wastewater treatment, and carbon emissions.

   How does compliance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs
   square with achieving development that can be sustained within the
   means of our planet? Ultimately, to be sustainable, development need to
   fit within our planet’s resource budget. Therefore sustainable
   development can be mapped as development achievement, on the on hand,
   and resource demand, on the other.

   The graph below summarizes the results. It shows the position of the
   top and bottom 10 countries on the SDG index in terms of their Human
   Development Index scores and their Ecological Footprints.

   [wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=] [efhdisdgi-300x249.jpg]

   The United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) measures a country’s
   average achievements in the areas of health, knowledge, and standard of
   living. An HDI higher than 0.8 is considered “very high human
   development.”  The Ecological Footprint tells us how much of the
   earth’s bioproductive areas are needed to provide for that
   development.  An Ecological Footprint less than 1.7 global hectares per
   person makes a country’s resource demands globally replicable.

   What this graph shows is that fulfilling the Sustainable Development
   Goals is no guarantee for sustainability. The top-ranked nations on the
   SDG index all have high Ecological Footprints. If everyone in the world
   lived like them, we would need more than three planets. In fact, it
   seems that there may be a tension as material development achievements
   are far more prominent in the SDGs than the need to preserve the
   underlying natural capital.

   This leads us to the second sustainability index that came out today:
   the Happy Planet Index from the New Economics Foundation. This index
   has far fewer ingredients than the SDSN index: The HPI is based on a
   ratio of a country’s well-being measurements (such as life expectancy,
   equality and satisfaction) divided by its Ecological Footprint. It
   measures who gets the best lives per unit of renewable natural
   resource.

   The Happy Planet Index results differ markedly from the SDSN index: The
   top country is Costa Rica, home to amazing biodiversity and residents
   who have higher well-being than the residents of many higher-income
   countries, including the US and the UK. Residents in Costa Rica also
   live longer than Americans. All this is achieved with an Ecological
   Footprint per person that is one third of the American Ecological
   Footprint and a GDP per capita that is less than a quarter of that of
   many Western European and North American countries.

   Perhaps the adage money doesn’t buy happiness holds true after all. Or
   does the SDSN index suggest otherwise?
