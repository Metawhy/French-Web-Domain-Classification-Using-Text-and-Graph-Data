The century of drought

One third of the planet will be desert by the year 2100, say climate experts
in the most dire warning yet of the effects of global warming

   Drought threatening the lives of millions will spread across half the
   land surface of the Earth in the coming century because of global
   warming, according to new predictions from Britain's leading climate
   scientists.

   Extreme drought, in which agriculture is in effect impossible, will
   affect about a third of the planet, according to the study from the Met
   Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.

   It is one of the most dire forecasts so far of the potential effects of
   rising temperatures around the world - yet it may be an
   underestimation, the scientists involved said yesterday.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   The findings, released at the Climate Clinic at the Conservative Party
   conference in Bournemouth, drew astonished and dismayed reactions from
   aid agencies and development specialists, who fear that the poor of
   developing countries will be worst hit.

   "This is genuinely terrifying," said Andrew Pendleton of Christian Aid.
   "It is a death sentence for many millions of people. It will mean
   migration off the land at levels we have not seen before, and at levels
   poor countries cannot cope with."

   One of Britain's leading experts on the effects of climate change on
   the developing countries, Andrew Simms from the New Economics
   Foundation, said: "There's almost no aspect of life in the developing
   countries that these predictions don't undermine - the ability to grow
   food, the ability to have a safe sanitation system, the availability of
   water. For hundreds of millions of people for whom getting through the
   day is already a struggle, this is going to push them over the
   precipice."

   The findings represent the first time that the threat of increased
   drought from climate change has been quantified with a supercomputer
   climate model such as the one operated by the Hadley Centre.

   Their impact is likely to even greater because the findings may be an
   underestimate. The study did not include potential effects on drought
   from global-warming-induced changes to the Earth's carbon cycle.

   In one unpublished Met Office study, when the carbon cycle effects are
   included, future drought is even worse.

   The results are regarded as most valid at the global level, but the
   clear implication is that the parts of the world already stricken by
   drought, such as Africa, will be the places where the projected
   increase will have the most severe effects.

   The study, by Eleanor Burke and two Hadley Centre colleagues, models
   how a measure of drought known as the Palmer Drought Severity Index
   (PDSI) is likely to increase globally during the coming century with
   predicted changes in rainfall and heat around the world because of
   climate change. It shows the PDSI figure for moderate drought,
   currently at 25 per cent of the Earth's surface, rising to 50 per cent
   by 2100, the figure for severe drought, currently at about 8 per cent,
   rising to 40 cent, and the figure for extreme drought, currently 3 per
   cent, rising to 30 per cent.

   Senior Met Office scientists are sensitive about the study, funded by
   the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, stressing it
   contains uncertainties: there is only one climate model involved, one
   future scenario for emissions of greenhouse gases (a moderate-to-high
   one) and one drought index. Nevertheless, the result is "significant",
   according to Vicky Pope, the head of the Hadley Centre's climate
   programme. Further work would now be taking place to try to assess the
   potential risk of different levels of drought in different places, she
   said.

   The full study - Modelling the Recent Evolution of Global Drought and
   Projections for the 21st Century with the Hadley Centre Climate Model -
   will be published later this month in The Journal of Hydrometeorology .

   It will be widely publicised by the British Government at the
   negotiations in Nairobi in November on a successor to the Kyoto climate
   treaty. But a preview of it was given by Dr Burke in a presentation to
   the Climate Clinic, which was formed by environmental groups, with The
   Independent as media partner, to press politicians for tougher action
   on climate change. The Climate Clinic has been in operation at all the
   party conferences.

   While the study will be seen as a cause for great concern, it is the
   figure for the increase in extreme drought that some observers find
   most frightening.

   "We're talking about 30 per cent of the world's land surface becoming
   essentially uninhabitable in terms of agricultural production in the
   space of a few decades," Mark Lynas, the author of High Tide, the first
   major account of the visible effects of global warming around the
   world, said. "These are parts of the world where hundreds of millions
   of people will no longer be able to feed themselves."

   Mr Pendleton said: "This means you're talking about any form of
   development going straight out of the window. The vast majority of poor
   people in the developing world are small-scale farmers who... rely on
   rain."

   A glimpse of what lies ahead

   The sun beats down across northern Kenya's Rift Valley, turning brown
   what was once green. Farmers and nomadic herders are waiting with bated
   breath for the arrival of the "short" rains - a few weeks of intense
   rainfall that will ensure their crops grow and their cattle can eat.

   The short rains are due in the next month. Last year they never came;
   large swaths of the Horn of Africa stayed brown. From Ethiopia and
   Eritrea, through Somalia and down into Tanzania, 11 million people were
   at risk of hunger.

   This devastating image of a drought-ravaged region offers a glimpse of
   what lies ahead for large parts of the planet as global warming takes
   hold.

   In Kenya, the animals died first. The nomadic herders' one source of
   sustenance and income - their cattle - perished with nothing to eat and
   nothing to drink. Bleached skeletons of cows and goats littered the
   barren landscape.

   The number of food emergencies in Africa each year has almost tripled
   since the 1980s. Across sub-Saharan Africa, one in three people is
   under-nourished. Poor governance has played a part.

   Pastoralist communities suffer most, rather than farmers and urban
   dwellers. Nomadic herders will walk for weeks to find a water hole or
   riverbed. As resources dwindle, fighting between tribes over scarce
   resources becomes common.

   One of the most critical issues is under-investment in pastoralist
   areas. Here, roads are rare, schools and hospitals almost non-existent.

   Nomadic herders in Turkana, northern Kenya, who saw their cattle die
   last year, are making adjustments to their way of life. When charities
   offerednew cattle, they said no. Instead, they asked for donkeys and
   camels - animals more likely to survive hard times.

   Pastoralists have little other than their animals to rely on. But
   projects which provide them with money to buy food elsewhere have
   proved effective, in the short term at least.

Children make people happier – but only once they’ve left home, study finds

   People with adult sons and daughters have more freedom as they have a
   support network to look after them

   People whose children have flown the nest have greater life
   satisfaction and fewer signs of depression ( Getty )

   Parents often say their children bring them joy but most research
   suggests kids cause financial worry, stress and anxiety.

   However, the latest research suggests children do actually make people
   happier – but only once they’ve left home.

   Researchers led by Christoph Becker at Heidelberg University in Germany
   found people whose children have flown the nest have greater life
   satisfaction and fewer signs of depression. This is because they rely
   on their children to help them out financially and provide care, which
   outweighs the stress of raising them.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   The team looked at 55,000 people over the age of 50 living in 16
   European countries and asked them to rate their life satisfaction from
   0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied).

   Scientists found that adults with grown-up children scored between 0.02
   and 0.56 points higher on the scale.

   Dr Becker told The Independent: “That is, of course not an extremely
   big difference, but it comes from a data set with thousands of
   respondents. Hence, while children might not be the biggest driver of
   life satisfaction and happiness it has on average still a significant
   influence.”

   They found that adults who have regular contact with their children are
   happier than parents who still live with their children or never had
   them.

   Dr Becker said: “We build on a lot of pre-existing literature and
   rather than finding some completely unique new result for children, we
   lend further evidence to the literature suggesting that children
   correlate with higher happiness under specific circumstances.”

   Researchers also found that marriage was “consistently positively
   correlated with wellbeing and lack of depressive symptoms”.

   The findings show social networks are also an important determinant for
   well-being and happiness – it is not just about being married or having
   children but having people to share feelings and thoughts with too.

   “Taken together, our results suggest that social networks may be
   important for wellbeing and mental health in old age. Spouses, partners
   and children are often the basis of long-lasting social networks, which
   can provide social support to elderly people,” according to the study,
   published in Plos One.

   “While results on parenthood might be controversial and depend on the
   age of the studied population, there is widespread agreement that
   social support is associated with higher life satisfaction, and that
   social networks are an important factor for wellbeing.”

Mauricio Pochettino: I have never been so unhappy at Tottenham

   Tottenham's stadium delay and the club's failure to sign any players in
   the summer have left the Argentine frustrated

   Frustrations are running high for the Tottenham manager ( Getty )

   Mauricio Pochettino admits he has never been more unhappy as Tottenham
   Hotspur manager.

   Spurs announced this week that a move back to White Hart Lane has now
   been delayed further until January 2019 at the earliest.

   They may be riding high in the league, with their best start to a
   campaign under the Argentine, ahead of a key game against Manchester
   City at Wembley on Monday night, but Pochettino is a man frustrated.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   He is frustrated most tellingly at the stadium delay but a lack of
   summer signings and several players returning fatigued after the World
   Cup is also on his mind.

   “The season so far, it’s strange because my feeling is the worst
   feeling I’ve had in the five years that I’ve been here,” he said. “It’s
   the worst. My feeling, but it’s the best start ever for the club in the
   Premier League. It’s strange, no?

   “I don’t know, it’s so difficult to explain because the circumstance
   because many things happen, I am disappointed we are still waiting for
   the new stadium when the expectation was to be there at the beginning
   of the season.

   “I don’t know, many things happened in the summer, many things that
   make myself not in my best mood or best humour. I know I always have a
   good relationship with you [the press] but my feeling is not the best
   feeling, I had better feeling in previous seasons.”

     * Pochettino refuses to blame Lloris but captain’s form is major
       concern

   Pochettino is clearly a man disheartened by Tottenham’s tag of nearly
   men, failing to beat PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday
   heightening his disappointment with progression in that competition
   only a remote possibility now.

   “I think, like a team, we still didn’t win nothing,” he said. “We fail
   but we achieve. And of course always when we arrive at like a final
   game, we always fail.

   “It’s about learning to compete. It’s about learning to be better. It’s
   about changing something we need to do different.

   “Or maybe we are never going to learn because we have some quality but
   we cannot cross this level. I prefer to think that we will learn more
   and we need more time to improve as a team.

   “Still we are not showing that level to be a real contender. That is my
   opinion.

   “Today we need to fix other problems and different circumstances that
   happen that don’t help the team or the club to only be focused on
   winning titles.

   “Sometimes people expect that we should be winning or we must win
   titles when the circumstances are not ideal.”

   men (Getty)

   Of course, it is that new stadium that is causing most of Pochettino’s
   anguish as he contemplates just how to match up against other members
   of the top six including Manchester City.

   “I don’t have the answer how we are going to act when we are going to
   move there,” said Pochettino. “It is easy to see in the last few years
   how we act in front of the market, how we act in front of everything
   and how the other teams were acting. That is the difference.

   “Everything is not perfect but we are in a circumstance and a project
   that is completely different to another club, at the moment.

   “But maybe when we arrive to the new stadium in the future, we will be
   in the same project, or we are going to act the same as other teams are
   acting like Liverpool, City, United, Chelsea and Arsenal.

   “It is my wish and I hope for the club, for the fans, for everyone to
   be available to fight in the same condition as the other clubs and show
   our real skills.

   “The way we have been competing in the last few years, the frustration
   is massive because we have had less in every single aspect.”

   The Dutch parliament has voted to ban arms exports to Saudi Arabia in
   protest against the kingdom's humanitarian and rights violations.

   It sees the Netherlands become the first EU country to put in practice
   a motion by the European Parliament in February urging a bloc-wide
   Saudi arms embargo.

   The bill, voted through by Dutch MPs on Tuesday, quoted UN figures
   which suggest almost 6,000 people - half of them civilians - have been
   killed since Saudi-led troops entered the conflict in Yemen.

   It also cited the mass execution of 47 people, largely political
   dissidents, ordered by the Saudi judiciary on 2 January this year.

   According to Reuters, the Dutch bill asks the government to implement a
   strict weapons embargo that includes dual-use exports which could
   potentially be used to violate human rights.

   The vote adds to the growing pressure on Britain, one of the main arms
   suppliers to Riyadh, to reconsider its stance.
   David Cameron on arms trading with Saudi Arabia

   Andrew Smith, a spokesman for Campaign Against Arms Trade, told The
   Independent: "The Dutch parliament has set an important precedent and
   it's time for other arms dealing governments to do the same. The
   decision can't just be temporary though, it must be permanent.

   "Saudi Arabia has a terrible human rights record and governments like
   the UK must stop supporting it. The bombardment of Yemen has lasted
   almost a year now and the humanitarian situation is desperate."

   According to updated Campaign Against Arms Trade figures, the UK has
   now sold more than £6.7 billion worth of weapons to the Saudi
   government under David Cameron - £2.8 billion in deals since the
   bombing in Yemen began.

   In October 2014, three lawyers, Dr Abdulrahman al-Subaihi, Bander
   al-Nogaithan and Abdulrahman al-Rumaih , were sentenced to up to eight
   years in prison for using Twitter to criticize the Ministry of Justice.

   In March 2015, Yemen’s Sunni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was
   forced into exile after a Shia-led insurgency. A Saudi Arabia-led
   coalition has responded with air strikes in order to reinstate Mr Hadi.
   It has since been accused of committing war crimes in the country.

   Women who supported the Women2Drive campaign, launched in 2011 to
   challenge the ban on women driving vehicles, faced harassment and
   intimidation by the authorities. The government warned that women
   drivers would face arrest.

   Members of the Kingdom’s Shia minority, most of whom live in the
   oil-rich Eastern Province, continue to face discrimination that limits
   their access to government services and employment. Activists have
   received death sentences or long prison terms for their alleged
   participation in protests in 2011 and 2012.

   All public gatherings are prohibited under an order issued by the
   Interior Ministry in 2011. Those defy the ban face arrest, prosecution
   and imprisonment on charges such as “inciting people against the
   authorities”.

   In March 2014, the Interior Ministry stated that authorities had
   deported over 370,000 foreign migrants and that 18,000 others were in
   detention. Thousands of workers were returned to Somalia and other
   states where they were at risk of human rights abuses, with large
   numbers also returned to Yemen, in order to open more jobs to Saudi
   Arabians. Many migrants reported that prior to their deportation they
   had been packed into overcrowded makeshift detention facilities where
   they received little food and water and were abused by guards.

   The Saudi Arabian authorities continue to deny access to independent
   human rights organisations like Amnesty International, and they have
   been known to take punitive action, including through the courts,
   against activists and family members of victims who contact Amnesty.

   Raif Badawi was sentenced to 1000 lashes and 10 years in prison for
   using his liberal blog to criticise Saudi Arabia’s clerics. He has
   already received 50 lashes, which have reportedly left him in poor
   health.

   Dawood al-Marhoon was arrested aged 17 for participating in an
   anti-government protest. After refusing to spy on his fellow
   protestors, he was tortured and forced to sign a blank document that
   would later contain his ‘confession’. At Dawood’s trial, the
   prosecution requested death by crucifixion while refusing him a lawyer.

   Ali Mohammed al-Nimr was arrested in 2012 aged either 16 or 17 for
   participating in protests during the Arab spring. His sentence includes
   beheading and crucifixion. The international community has spoken out
   against the punishment and has called on Saudi Arabia to stop. He is
   the nephew of a prominent government dissident.

   France is the other major European supplier of arms to the Saudi
   kingdom. Germany's exports amounted to almost £140 million in the first
   six months of 2015, while figures for the Netherlands itself were not
   available.

About The Independent commenting

   Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership
   scheme, Independent Premium. It allows our most engaged readers to
   debate the big issues, share their own experiences, discuss real-world
   solutions, and more. Our journalists will try to respond by joining the
   threads when they can to create a true meeting of independent Premium.
   The most insightful comments on all subjects will be published daily in
   dedicated articles. You can also choose to be emailed when someone
   replies to your comment.

   The existing Open Comments threads will continue to exist for those who
   do not subscribe to Independent Premium. Due to the sheer scale of this
   comment community, we are not able to give each post the same level of
   attention, but we have preserved this area in the interests of open
   debate. Please continue to respect all commenters and create
   constructive debates.

The century of drought

One third of the planet will be desert by the year 2100, say climate experts
in the most dire warning yet of the effects of global warming

   Drought threatening the lives of millions will spread across half the
   land surface of the Earth in the coming century because of global
   warming, according to new predictions from Britain's leading climate
   scientists.

   Extreme drought, in which agriculture is in effect impossible, will
   affect about a third of the planet, according to the study from the Met
   Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.

   It is one of the most dire forecasts so far of the potential effects of
   rising temperatures around the world - yet it may be an
   underestimation, the scientists involved said yesterday.

   The findings, released at the Climate Clinic at the Conservative Party
   conference in Bournemouth, drew astonished and dismayed reactions from
   aid agencies and development specialists, who fear that the poor of
   developing countries will be worst hit.

   "This is genuinely terrifying," said Andrew Pendleton of Christian Aid.
   "It is a death sentence for many millions of people. It will mean
   migration off the land at levels we have not seen before, and at levels
   poor countries cannot cope with."

   One of Britain's leading experts on the effects of climate change on
   the developing countries, Andrew Simms from the New Economics
   Foundation, said: "There's almost no aspect of life in the developing
   countries that these predictions don't undermine - the ability to grow
   food, the ability to have a safe sanitation system, the availability of
   water. For hundreds of millions of people for whom getting through the
   day is already a struggle, this is going to push them over the
   precipice."

   The findings represent the first time that the threat of increased
   drought from climate change has been quantified with a supercomputer
   climate model such as the one operated by the Hadley Centre.

   Their impact is likely to even greater because the findings may be an
   underestimate. The study did not include potential effects on drought
   from global-warming-induced changes to the Earth's carbon cycle.

   In one unpublished Met Office study, when the carbon cycle effects are
   included, future drought is even worse.

   The results are regarded as most valid at the global level, but the
   clear implication is that the parts of the world already stricken by
   drought, such as Africa, will be the places where the projected
   increase will have the most severe effects.

   The study, by Eleanor Burke and two Hadley Centre colleagues, models
   how a measure of drought known as the Palmer Drought Severity Index
   (PDSI) is likely to increase globally during the coming century with
   predicted changes in rainfall and heat around the world because of
   climate change. It shows the PDSI figure for moderate drought,
   currently at 25 per cent of the Earth's surface, rising to 50 per cent
   by 2100, the figure for severe drought, currently at about 8 per cent,
   rising to 40 cent, and the figure for extreme drought, currently 3 per
   cent, rising to 30 per cent.

   Senior Met Office scientists are sensitive about the study, funded by
   the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, stressing it
   contains uncertainties: there is only one climate model involved, one
   future scenario for emissions of greenhouse gases (a moderate-to-high
   one) and one drought index. Nevertheless, the result is "significant",
   according to Vicky Pope, the head of the Hadley Centre's climate
   programme. Further work would now be taking place to try to assess the
   potential risk of different levels of drought in different places, she
   said.

   The full study - Modelling the Recent Evolution of Global Drought and
   Projections for the 21st Century with the Hadley Centre Climate Model -
   will be published later this month in The Journal of Hydrometeorology .

   It will be widely publicised by the British Government at the
   negotiations in Nairobi in November on a successor to the Kyoto climate
   treaty. But a preview of it was given by Dr Burke in a presentation to
   the Climate Clinic, which was formed by environmental groups, with The
   Independent as media partner, to press politicians for tougher action
   on climate change. The Climate Clinic has been in operation at all the
   party conferences.

   While the study will be seen as a cause for great concern, it is the
   figure for the increase in extreme drought that some observers find
   most frightening.

   "We're talking about 30 per cent of the world's land surface becoming
   essentially uninhabitable in terms of agricultural production in the
   space of a few decades," Mark Lynas, the author of High Tide, the first
   major account of the visible effects of global warming around the
   world, said. "These are parts of the world where hundreds of millions
   of people will no longer be able to feed themselves."

   Mr Pendleton said: "This means you're talking about any form of
   development going straight out of the window. The vast majority of poor
   people in the developing world are small-scale farmers who... rely on
   rain."

   A glimpse of what lies ahead

   The sun beats down across northern Kenya's Rift Valley, turning brown
   what was once green. Farmers and nomadic herders are waiting with bated
   breath for the arrival of the "short" rains - a few weeks of intense
   rainfall that will ensure their crops grow and their cattle can eat.

   The short rains are due in the next month. Last year they never came;
   large swaths of the Horn of Africa stayed brown. From Ethiopia and
   Eritrea, through Somalia and down into Tanzania, 11 million people were
   at risk of hunger.

   This devastating image of a drought-ravaged region offers a glimpse of
   what lies ahead for large parts of the planet as global warming takes
   hold.

   In Kenya, the animals died first. The nomadic herders' one source of
   sustenance and income - their cattle - perished with nothing to eat and
   nothing to drink. Bleached skeletons of cows and goats littered the
   barren landscape.

   The number of food emergencies in Africa each year has almost tripled
   since the 1980s. Across sub-Saharan Africa, one in three people is
   under-nourished. Poor governance has played a part.

   Pastoralist communities suffer most, rather than farmers and urban
   dwellers. Nomadic herders will walk for weeks to find a water hole or
   riverbed. As resources dwindle, fighting between tribes over scarce
   resources becomes common.

   One of the most critical issues is under-investment in pastoralist
   areas. Here, roads are rare, schools and hospitals almost non-existent.

   Nomadic herders in Turkana, northern Kenya, who saw their cattle die
   last year, are making adjustments to their way of life. When charities
   offerednew cattle, they said no. Instead, they asked for donkeys and
   camels - animals more likely to survive hard times.

   Pastoralists have little other than their animals to rely on. But
   projects which provide them with money to buy food elsewhere have
   proved effective, in the short term at least.

About The Independent commenting

   Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership
   scheme, Independent Premium. It allows our most engaged readers to
   debate the big issues, share their own experiences, discuss real-world
   solutions, and more. Our journalists will try to respond by joining the
   threads when they can to create a true meeting of independent Premium.
   The most insightful comments on all subjects will be published daily in
   dedicated articles. You can also choose to be emailed when someone
   replies to your comment.

   The existing Open Comments threads will continue to exist for those who
   do not subscribe to Independent Premium. Due to the sheer scale of this
   comment community, we are not able to give each post the same level of
   attention, but we have preserved this area in the interests of open
   debate. Please continue to respect all commenters and create
   constructive debates.

Children make people happier – but only once they’ve left home, study finds

   People with adult sons and daughters have more freedom as they have a
   support network to look after them

   People whose children have flown the nest have greater life
   satisfaction and fewer signs of depression ( Getty )

   Parents often say their children bring them joy but most research
   suggests kids cause financial worry, stress and anxiety.

   However, the latest research suggests children do actually make people
   happier – but only once they’ve left home.

   Researchers led by Christoph Becker at Heidelberg University in Germany
   found people whose children have flown the nest have greater life
   satisfaction and fewer signs of depression. This is because they rely
   on their children to help them out financially and provide care, which
   outweighs the stress of raising them.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   The team looked at 55,000 people over the age of 50 living in 16
   European countries and asked them to rate their life satisfaction from
   0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied).

   Scientists found that adults with grown-up children scored between 0.02
   and 0.56 points higher on the scale.

   Dr Becker told The Independent: “That is, of course not an extremely
   big difference, but it comes from a data set with thousands of
   respondents. Hence, while children might not be the biggest driver of
   life satisfaction and happiness it has on average still a significant
   influence.”

   They found that adults who have regular contact with their children are
   happier than parents who still live with their children or never had
   them.

   Dr Becker said: “We build on a lot of pre-existing literature and
   rather than finding some completely unique new result for children, we
   lend further evidence to the literature suggesting that children
   correlate with higher happiness under specific circumstances.”

   Researchers also found that marriage was “consistently positively
   correlated with wellbeing and lack of depressive symptoms”.

   The findings show social networks are also an important determinant for
   well-being and happiness – it is not just about being married or having
   children but having people to share feelings and thoughts with too.

   “Taken together, our results suggest that social networks may be
   important for wellbeing and mental health in old age. Spouses, partners
   and children are often the basis of long-lasting social networks, which
   can provide social support to elderly people,” according to the study,
   published in Plos One.

   “While results on parenthood might be controversial and depend on the
   age of the studied population, there is widespread agreement that
   social support is associated with higher life satisfaction, and that
   social networks are an important factor for wellbeing.”

Mauricio Pochettino: I have never been so unhappy at Tottenham

   Tottenham's stadium delay and the club's failure to sign any players in
   the summer have left the Argentine frustrated

   Frustrations are running high for the Tottenham manager ( Getty )

   Mauricio Pochettino admits he has never been more unhappy as Tottenham
   Hotspur manager.

   Spurs announced this week that a move back to White Hart Lane has now
   been delayed further until January 2019 at the earliest.

   They may be riding high in the league, with their best start to a
   campaign under the Argentine, ahead of a key game against Manchester
   City at Wembley on Monday night, but Pochettino is a man frustrated.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   He is frustrated most tellingly at the stadium delay but a lack of
   summer signings and several players returning fatigued after the World
   Cup is also on his mind.

   “The season so far, it’s strange because my feeling is the worst
   feeling I’ve had in the five years that I’ve been here,” he said. “It’s
   the worst. My feeling, but it’s the best start ever for the club in the
   Premier League. It’s strange, no?

   “I don’t know, it’s so difficult to explain because the circumstance
   because many things happen, I am disappointed we are still waiting for
   the new stadium when the expectation was to be there at the beginning
   of the season.

   “I don’t know, many things happened in the summer, many things that
   make myself not in my best mood or best humour. I know I always have a
   good relationship with you [the press] but my feeling is not the best
   feeling, I had better feeling in previous seasons.”

     * Pochettino refuses to blame Lloris but captain’s form is major
       concern

   Pochettino is clearly a man disheartened by Tottenham’s tag of nearly
   men, failing to beat PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday
   heightening his disappointment with progression in that competition
   only a remote possibility now.

   “I think, like a team, we still didn’t win nothing,” he said. “We fail
   but we achieve. And of course always when we arrive at like a final
   game, we always fail.

   “It’s about learning to compete. It’s about learning to be better. It’s
   about changing something we need to do different.

   “Or maybe we are never going to learn because we have some quality but
   we cannot cross this level. I prefer to think that we will learn more
   and we need more time to improve as a team.

   “Still we are not showing that level to be a real contender. That is my
   opinion.

   “Today we need to fix other problems and different circumstances that
   happen that don’t help the team or the club to only be focused on
   winning titles.

   “Sometimes people expect that we should be winning or we must win
   titles when the circumstances are not ideal.”

   men (Getty)

   Of course, it is that new stadium that is causing most of Pochettino’s
   anguish as he contemplates just how to match up against other members
   of the top six including Manchester City.

   “I don’t have the answer how we are going to act when we are going to
   move there,” said Pochettino. “It is easy to see in the last few years
   how we act in front of the market, how we act in front of everything
   and how the other teams were acting. That is the difference.

   “Everything is not perfect but we are in a circumstance and a project
   that is completely different to another club, at the moment.

   “But maybe when we arrive to the new stadium in the future, we will be
   in the same project, or we are going to act the same as other teams are
   acting like Liverpool, City, United, Chelsea and Arsenal.

   “It is my wish and I hope for the club, for the fans, for everyone to
   be available to fight in the same condition as the other clubs and show
   our real skills.

   “The way we have been competing in the last few years, the frustration
   is massive because we have had less in every single aspect.”

   The Dutch parliament has voted to ban arms exports to Saudi Arabia in
   protest against the kingdom's humanitarian and rights violations.

   It sees the Netherlands become the first EU country to put in practice
   a motion by the European Parliament in February urging a bloc-wide
   Saudi arms embargo.

   The bill, voted through by Dutch MPs on Tuesday, quoted UN figures
   which suggest almost 6,000 people - half of them civilians - have been
   killed since Saudi-led troops entered the conflict in Yemen.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   It also cited the mass execution of 47 people, largely political
   dissidents, ordered by the Saudi judiciary on 2 January this year.

   According to Reuters, the Dutch bill asks the government to implement a
   strict weapons embargo that includes dual-use exports which could
   potentially be used to violate human rights.

   The vote adds to the growing pressure on Britain, one of the main arms
   suppliers to Riyadh, to reconsider its stance.
   David Cameron on arms trading with Saudi Arabia

   Andrew Smith, a spokesman for Campaign Against Arms Trade, told The
   Independent: "The Dutch parliament has set an important precedent and
   it's time for other arms dealing governments to do the same. The
   decision can't just be temporary though, it must be permanent.

   "Saudi Arabia has a terrible human rights record and governments like
   the UK must stop supporting it. The bombardment of Yemen has lasted
   almost a year now and the humanitarian situation is desperate."

   According to updated Campaign Against Arms Trade figures, the UK has
   now sold more than £6.7 billion worth of weapons to the Saudi
   government under David Cameron - £2.8 billion in deals since the
   bombing in Yemen began.

Created with Sketch. 10 examples of Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses

1/10

   In October 2014, three lawyers, Dr Abdulrahman al-Subaihi, Bander
   al-Nogaithan and Abdulrahman al-Rumaih , were sentenced to up to eight
   years in prison for using Twitter to criticize the Ministry of Justice.

   In March 2015, Yemen’s Sunni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was
   forced into exile after a Shia-led insurgency. A Saudi Arabia-led
   coalition has responded with air strikes in order to reinstate Mr Hadi.
   It has since been accused of committing war crimes in the country.

   Women who supported the Women2Drive campaign, launched in 2011 to
   challenge the ban on women driving vehicles, faced harassment and
   intimidation by the authorities. The government warned that women
   drivers would face arrest.

   Members of the Kingdom’s Shia minority, most of whom live in the
   oil-rich Eastern Province, continue to face discrimination that limits
   their access to government services and employment. Activists have
   received death sentences or long prison terms for their alleged
   participation in protests in 2011 and 2012.

   All public gatherings are prohibited under an order issued by the
   Interior Ministry in 2011. Those defy the ban face arrest, prosecution
   and imprisonment on charges such as “inciting people against the
   authorities”.

   In March 2014, the Interior Ministry stated that authorities had
   deported over 370,000 foreign migrants and that 18,000 others were in
   detention. Thousands of workers were returned to Somalia and other
   states where they were at risk of human rights abuses, with large
   numbers also returned to Yemen, in order to open more jobs to Saudi
   Arabians. Many migrants reported that prior to their deportation they
   had been packed into overcrowded makeshift detention facilities where
   they received little food and water and were abused by guards.

   The Saudi Arabian authorities continue to deny access to independent
   human rights organisations like Amnesty International, and they have
   been known to take punitive action, including through the courts,
   against activists and family members of victims who contact Amnesty.

   Raif Badawi was sentenced to 1000 lashes and 10 years in prison for
   using his liberal blog to criticise Saudi Arabia’s clerics. He has
   already received 50 lashes, which have reportedly left him in poor
   health.

   Dawood al-Marhoon was arrested aged 17 for participating in an
   anti-government protest. After refusing to spy on his fellow
   protestors, he was tortured and forced to sign a blank document that
   would later contain his ‘confession’. At Dawood’s trial, the
   prosecution requested death by crucifixion while refusing him a lawyer.

   Ali Mohammed al-Nimr was arrested in 2012 aged either 16 or 17 for
   participating in protests during the Arab spring. His sentence includes
   beheading and crucifixion. The international community has spoken out
   against the punishment and has called on Saudi Arabia to stop. He is
   the nephew of a prominent government dissident.

   Raif Badawi was sentenced to 1000 lashes and 10 years in prison for
   using his liberal blog to criticise Saudi Arabia’s clerics. He has
   already received 50 lashes, which have reportedly left him in poor
   health.

   Dawood al-Marhoon was arrested aged 17 for participating in an
   anti-government protest. After refusing to spy on his fellow
   protestors, he was tortured and forced to sign a blank document that
   would later contain his ‘confession’. At Dawood’s trial, the
   prosecution requested death by crucifixion while refusing him a lawyer.

   Ali Mohammed al-Nimr was arrested in 2012 aged either 16 or 17 for
   participating in protests during the Arab spring. His sentence includes
   beheading and crucifixion. The international community has spoken out
   against the punishment and has called on Saudi Arabia to stop. He is
   the nephew of a prominent government dissident.

   France is the other major European supplier of arms to the Saudi
   kingdom. Germany's exports amounted to almost £140 million in the first
   six months of 2015, while figures for the Netherlands itself were not
   available.

About The Independent commenting

   Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership
   scheme, Independent Premium. It allows our most engaged readers to
   debate the big issues, share their own experiences, discuss real-world
   solutions, and more. Our journalists will try to respond by joining the
   threads when they can to create a true meeting of independent Premium.
   The most insightful comments on all subjects will be published daily in
   dedicated articles. You can also choose to be emailed when someone
   replies to your comment.

   The existing Open Comments threads will continue to exist for those who
   do not subscribe to Independent Premium. Due to the sheer scale of this
   comment community, we are not able to give each post the same level of
   attention, but we have preserved this area in the interests of open
   debate. Please continue to respect all commenters and create
   constructive debates.

   personalised path to learning. Initial results are promising but, Sonia
   Klug asks, what are the risks and benefits of letting machines teach
   the next generation?

Friends: 10 times the classic sitcom was problematic

   The Central Perk crew was not always there for everyone

   If you’re a millennial, you probably binge-watched Friends growing up
   (or later on via Netflix). Perhaps it was a sign of the times or a lack
   of self-awareness on the part of the writers, but many of the
   storylines, situations and characters on Friends were problematic.

   While the six besties Ross and Monica Geller, Rachel Green, Chandler
   Bing, Joey Tribbiani and Phoebe Buffay seemed like people you wanted to
   hang out with back in the ‘90s, you might change your mind in 2018.
   Storylines laced with homophobia, sexism, borderline emotional abuse
   and sexual harassment are portrayed as punchlines. The lack of
   diversity within its 10 seasons is inexcusable and embarrassing. Truth
   be told, several of the jokes written in the show that began 24 years
   ago probably would be thrown out before they even got into the writer’s
   room.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

     * Millennials think Friends is problematic after watching it on
       Netflix

   Recently, Friends was added to Netflix in the UK, and millennials were
   astounded by the problematic elements that persisted for 10 seasons.
   Below are highlights of the troublesome themes, moments and jokes that
   happened during the show’s decade-long run.

When Ross voices his disapproval of Ben playing with a doll

   Ross’ ex-wife comes out as a lesbian and they always seemed to play up
   on that in the show in some way. In one of the ways it happens, Ross
   sees his son Ben playing with a Barbie doll. He exclaims, “Why is my
   boy playing with a Barbie?” Ross somehow manages to convince himself
   his lesbian ex-wife and her partner forced Ben to play with Barbies.

   Lesson learned: Don’t be homophobic, and let your kid be themselves!

When Rachel hires Tag because he’s attractive

   Credit: NBC.

   In a plot that would be textbook sexual harassment, Rachel hired hot
   and simple 24-year-old Tag for an assistant job he wasn’t qualified for
   purely because she wanted to date him. This was instead of hiring Hilda
   who met all of the requirements to be her assistant. Of course, Rachel
   and Tag end up dating until she breaks it off because he’s too
   immature.

   Lesson learned: Don’t hire someone because you think you’ll want to
   date them!


When Joey is perceived as "feminine"


   Joey seems to be the butt of everyone’s jokes especially when he likes
   more “feminine” things. There’s a whole episode dedicated to his love
   of his shoulder bag that is mocked as well as how he explains how he
   likes wearing makeup. Everyone makes a point of saying it’s a “woman’s
   purse,” but it’s just a shoulder bag. Chandler of course chides him
   saying, “Yeah, pulling flowers out of it makes the bag look a lot more
   masculine.”

   Lesson learned: Let people like what they like - don’t be sexist!

When Ross couldn’t handle having a male nanny

   The male nanny plot line was played out distastefully later in the
   series. Rachel finds an extremely qualified male nanny, and they hire
   him. Ross takes every opportunity he can to mock the nanny, played by
   Freddie Prinze Jr, who is portrayed as extremely sensitive. The way the
   nanny was presented was extremely stereotypical and Ross’ reaction to
   having a male nanny was sexist.

   Lesson learned: Avoid stereotypes and sexism!

When Monica was fat shamed

   Credit: NBC.

   One of the most consistent themes running through all 10 seasons of
   Friends was fat shaming Monica. We get it: Monica was overweight in
   high school. But Monica’s weight is a relentless punchline that is
   offensive. Joey memorably yells, “Some girl ate Monica” in a video of
   Monica in her prom dress eating a sandwich while prepping for the
   event. Monica’s friends never let her forget about her time as “Fat
   Monica,” as if it’s shameful.

   Lesson learned: Don’t body shame others!

When Ross became an obsessive and controlling boyfriend

   In retrospect, Ross and Rachel’s relationship is 50 shades of toxic,
   but that’s mostly because of Ross. His behaviour is borderline
   emotionally abusive when you look back on it. He essentially stalks
   Rachel while she’s getting lunch with her friend Mark because he
   doesn’t trust that they’re just friends. It becomes a through line for
   an overarching story for the season and even comes back for a minute in
   season 10. While his behaviour was seemingly all laughs back then, it
   was uncomfortable to watch.

   Lesson learned: Trust your partner!

When Chandler interacted with his transgender dad

   Friends scene sees Chandler's father attacked for gender non-conformity

   It’s no secret there was an underlying homophobic and transphobic tone
   to Friends, but particularly with the character of Chandler. Chandler’s
   mom - played by Kathleen Turner - is a transgender Vegas drag queen,
   something he’s constantly embarrassed by throughout the series. She is
   a punchline who never gets referred to with the right pronouns --
   Chandler also loves to mock the fact that she wore dresses. The gang
   doesn’t hold back about questioning the genitalia Chandler’s dad has
   either - something that is super invasive.

   Lesson learned: Be inclusive and respectful to everyone - don’t be
   transphobic!

When there were only two people of colour in the show

   Credit: NBC.

   It’s hard to think about diversity when it comes to Friends because
   there really wasn’t any. The closest the cast got to diversity was when
   Ross dated Julie who was Asian and later in the series when he dated
   Dr. Charlie Wheeler, who was black. The Friends cast and guest stars
   were all extremely white.

   Lesson learned: Promote diversity in casting!

When Chandler was paranoid of people thinking he’s gay

   Throughout the series, Chandler is always hypersensitive to people
   thinking he’s too feminine or of being perceived as gay. People
   mistaken Chandler for being gay and it’s lauded as something to be
   ashamed of in the show. In the episode when Monica and Ross’ nana dies
   twice, Chandler finds out people assume he’s gay, which doesn’t sit
   with him well. This combined with his mom makes him an extremely
   insecure, homophobic character who always feels the need to defend his
   sexuality.

   Lesson learned: I repeat: don’t be homophobic!

When Ross dated one of his students

   Credit: NBC.

   In his Paleontology class, Ross gets an anonymous letter in a survey
   from one of his students that showed she had a crush on him. Ross
   somehow thinks that dating said student (Elizabeth) is only “frowned
   upon” and is then shocked to find out it could actually get him fired.
   But that apparently doesn’t matter because they’re so into each other
   that they hide their relationship from the faculty.

   Lesson learned: Sneaking around is a sign you shouldn’t be doing
   something - don’t date your students!

If these extraordinarily powerful images of a dead Syrian child washed up on
a beach don't change Europe's attitude to refugees, what will?

   The boy was part of a group of 11 Syrians who drowned off the coastal
   town of Bodrum in Turkey after an apparent failed attempt to flee the
   war-ravaged country

   The pictures show a small boy lying face down in the sand on a Turkish
   beach as an official stands over him.

   The child, who is thought to be Syrian, has drowned in an apparent
   attempt to flee the war ravaging his country.

   They are extraordinary images and serve as a stark reminder that, as
   European leaders increasingly try to prevent refugees from settling in
   the continent, more and more refugees are dying in their desperation to
   flee persecution and reach safety.

   The Independent has taken the decision to publish these images because,
   among the often glib words about the "ongoing migrant crisis", it is
   all too easy to forget the reality of the desperate situation facing
   many refugees.

   The boy, pictured below being carried by the official, is one of 12
   Syrian refugees feared dead after they drowned trying to cross the
   Mediterranean on two boats bound for the Greek island of Kos.

   failed attempt to sail to the Greek island of Kos (Reuters)

   One of the boats was carrying six Syrians when it sank after leaving
   Akyarlar, in a desperate attempt to cross the 5km Aegean straight to
   Kos that represented their best chance of entering the EU.

   According to Turkey’s Dogan news agency, three children and a woman
   from the small boat drowned. Two people survived after swimming back to
   shore in life jackets.

   In Britain, David Cameron and Philip Hammond have been criticised for
   the “dehumanising” language they use to describe refugees.

   The Prime Minister described refugees coming to the UK as a “swarm”,
   and later said he would not “allow people to break into our country”.

   Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, said refugees were “marauding” around
   Calais. Amnesty International called his comments “shameful”.

   dinghy sank off the coast of Turkey (Qattouby/Twitter)

   The pictures, and the tragedy they convey, are hard to ignore, and now
   senior politicians are calling on Cameron to do more to tackle the
   crisis.

   Labour leadership front-runner Jeremy Corbyn told The Independent:
   "Nobody could fail to be moved by this harrowing and heartbreaking
   image.

   "It should remind us of the situation facing millions of people
   desperately fleeing a terrible civil war.

   "The government's response to the refugee crisis has been wholly
   inadequate, and we are being shamed by our European neighbours."

   Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, told The Independent: "Enough
   is enough. These pictures are beyond horrific. They are the wake-up
   call David Cameron needs."

   He was joined by Yvette Cooper, another contender for the Labour leader
   post, who told The Independent: "It is heartbreaking what is happening
   on our continent. We cannot keep turning our backs on this. We can -
   and must - do more."

   Along with Afghan citizens, Syrians make up the bulk of the people
   fleeing conflict in their homeland to seek a safer home in Europe.

   But while images of desperate refugees emerge almost every day, the

   to harden.

   Budapest blocked refugees from boarding trains to Germany for a second
   day running.

   In the Czech Republic, some 200 refugees with valid train tickets were

   In the Netherlands, the government has announced a toughening of its

Avatar 4 and 5: James Cameron sequels might not be happening

   The final two films in the filmmaker's franchise were reportedly never
   certain

   James Cameron may be hard at work on his four Avatar sequels, however,
   the final two instalments might not even see the light of day.

   With production now complete on Avatar 2 and 3, it’s been revealed that
   Cameron is waiting to officially receive the go-ahead for Avatar 4 and
   5.

   Whether or not Cameron will be given free rein to see out his creative
   vision is said to become more apparent toward the end of the month,
   following the completion of the forthcoming Disney-Fox merger.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   Despite the four sequels being confirmed in 2017, CinemaBlend reports
   that Avatar 4 and 5 were never certain. Instead, Fox had decided to
   wait and see whether the second and third outings did well at the box
   office before permitting Cameron to direct any more.

     * Kate Winslet pulled off a death-defying stunt for Avatar 2 and 3
     * James Cameron reveals why Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5 have taken so long
     * Avatar 2, 3, 4 & 5 officially start production with $1 billion
       budget

   Following the merger, that decision will fall to Disney. According to
   Geek Tyrant, this could help Cameron’s cause considering “Pandora – The
   World of Avatar” theme park is part of Walt Disney World.

   Analysts estimate Cameron will spend upwards of $1 billion if the
   fourth and fifth outings are confirmed.

   Previously talking about the project, Cameron said: “The thing is, my
   focus isn’t on Avatar 2. It’s on Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5 equally. That’s
   exactly how I’m approaching it.“

1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)

   With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven
   Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically
   perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out
   of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s
   casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's
   finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot,
   interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still
   inspires. HO
   Rex

2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997)

   Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the
   darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped
   Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a
   leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes
   the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the
   Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart
   out at the end. PS
   Miramax Films

3/42 Spirited Away (2001)

   Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with
   their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines
   (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest,
   especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job
   in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her
   parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted
   interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination
   with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s
   unparalleled. HO
   Toho

4/42 Un Chien Andalou (1928)

   Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this
   16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with
   the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and
   the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage,
   which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS

5/42 Avengers (2012)

   Yes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel
   risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice,
   something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the
   fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens
   look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear
   how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult
   it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this
   scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO
   Marvel Studios

6/42 The Shining (1980)

   Stanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible
   images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence
   stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is
   the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an
   isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly
   desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as
   delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin
   and stay there. HO
   Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

7/42 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)

   One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s
   beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller
   translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit
   of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious
   health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the
   hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS

8/42 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)

   Wes Anderson's meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are
   not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a
   more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene
   Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making
   one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in
   support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as
   family life itself. HO
   Buena Vista Pictures

9/42 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)

   David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a
   filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before
   starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles –
   notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll
   that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab
   characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling
   filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO
   Rex

10/42 Bicycle Thieves (1948)

   A devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s
   neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto
   Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a
   bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate
   measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in
   circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in
   compassion and empathy. HO
   Rex Features

11/42 Farewell My Concubine (1993)

   Spanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows
   two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the
   perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural
   Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the
   Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance
   both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and
   between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO
   Miramax Films

12/42 Brazil (1985)

   Originally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on
   Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point:
   one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s
   befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of
   retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the
   best sci-fi production design ever. PS
   20th Century Fox

13/42 Tokyo Story (1953)

   Pauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss
   bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that
   film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple
   story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to
   find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s
   also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the
   constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you
   watch it. HO
   Rex Features

14/42 Double Indemnity (1944)

   If we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts
   never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when

15/42 Days of Heaven (1978)

   Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a
   mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in
   1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and
   Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a
   rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding
   magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies
   heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PS

16/42 Citizen Kane (1941)

   The problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is
   that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the
   technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s
   masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s
   more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and
   the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it
   ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media
   manipulation all too believable. HO

17/42 Les Enfants du Paradis (1945)

   Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in
   Marcel Carné's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only
   represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a
   gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s
   peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll
   ever see. PS

18/42 Rear Window (1954)

   Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or
   simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb
   example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s
   photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the
   lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually
   vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that
   simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the
   tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the
   lion’s mouth. HO

19/42 It Happened One Night (1934)

   Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his
   uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall
   for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the
   love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry,
   hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to
   hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of
   its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big
   five at the Oscars. PS

20/42 Hoop Dreams (1994)

   The trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us

   inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve
   James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports
   doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will
   never quite live down failing to nominate it. PS

   This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration
   of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into
   bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going.
   While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better,

   office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he
   carries entire scenes without a word. HO

22/42 Paris, Texas (1984)

   The title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both
   a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean
   Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek
   to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious
   to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window.
   Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it's a

   play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie
   Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love,
   death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a
   shattering experience for the faithful. PS

24/42 Before Midnight (2013)

   Céline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since
   the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before
   Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their
   lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly
   pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film
   squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term
   relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting
   the course. PS

25/42 Le Mépris (1963)

   Other Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But
   this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of
   filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on
   Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell
   art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his
   beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an
   incessant, pained ballet. PS

26/42 Casablanca (1942)

   Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca’s quality
   bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two
   former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them
   apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of
   cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an
   iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable
   cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO

27/42 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)

   On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all
   sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing
   and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an
   undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter
   as it is sugary; and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little
   Christmas” is anything but merry. PS
   Rex

28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902)

   Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects
   techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever
   since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this
   turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the
   strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of
   story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later,
   and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still
   beautifully designed and executed. HO
   Rex Features

29/42 Out of the Past (1947)

   Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques
   Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who
   can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the
   doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka
   Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas
   as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS

30/42 His Girl Friday (1940)

   A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front
   Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it
   works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a
   moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht,
   who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary
   Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter
   trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year,
   remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged.
   HO

31/42 The Conversation (1974)

   Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking
   eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a
   career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself
   morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no
   other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in
   between the first two Godfathers. PS
   Paramount Pictures

32/42 Blow Out (1981)

   John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night,
   accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination.
   Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this
   stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's élan but also
   harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most
   delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s
   played for keeps. PS
   Filmways Pictures

33/42 City of God (2002)

   There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait
   of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and
   teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed
   in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and
   take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director
   Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity
   and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still
   shocks. HO

34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)

   The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara
   Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael
   Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a
   midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of
   disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It
   hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PS
   Rex

35/42 Raising Arizona (1987)

   The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style
   with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in
   a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being
   both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely
   couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes
   all hell to break loose. PS
   20th Century Fox

36/42 Caché (2005)

   This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s
   exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more
   about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian
   family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their
   lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading
   patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own
   past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are
   few to match it. HO
   Rex

37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004)

   Straight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help
   but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s
   phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for
   minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.
   Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action
   movie of the present millennium. PS

38/42 The General (1926)

   Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy
   might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s
   Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he
   and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union
   spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy
   of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if
   movies even need sound. HO

39/42 The Babadook (2014)

   The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your
   door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him.
   Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his
   book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman)
   before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast
   of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks.

40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989)

   Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is
   according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic
   New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner
   and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody
   Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating
   ("I'll have what she's having"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy
   Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers.
   Columbia Pictures

41/42 Inside Out (2015)

   Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best
   opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s
   head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a
   family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure
   through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely
   separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on
   a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think
   and feel. It’s wonderful.

42/42 True Romance (1993)

   Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called
   The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born
   Killers – Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a
   damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based
   on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on
   the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash
   – and totally brilliant.
   Rex

1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)

   With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven
   Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically
   perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out
   of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s
   casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's
   finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot,
   interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still
   inspires. HO

2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997)

   Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the
   darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped
   Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a
   leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes
   the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the
   Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart
   out at the end. PS
   Miramax Films

3/42 Spirited Away (2001)

   Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with
   their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines
   (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest,
   especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job
   in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her
   parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted
   interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination
   with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s
   unparalleled. HO
   Toho

4/42 Un Chien Andalou (1928)

   Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this
   16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with
   the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and
   the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage,
   which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS

5/42 Avengers (2012)

   Yes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel
   risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice,
   something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the
   fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens
   look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear
   how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult
   it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this
   scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO
   Marvel Studios

6/42 The Shining (1980)

   Stanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible
   images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence
   stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is
   the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an
   isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly
   desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as
   delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin
   and stay there. HO
   Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

7/42 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)

   One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s
   beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller
   translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit
   of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious
   health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the
   hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS

8/42 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)

   Wes Anderson's meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are
   not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a
   more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene
   Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making
   one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in
   support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as
   family life itself. HO
   Buena Vista Pictures

9/42 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)

   David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a
   filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before
   starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles –
   notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll
   that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab
   characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling
   filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO

10/42 Bicycle Thieves (1948)

   A devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s
   neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto
   Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a
   bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate
   measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in
   circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in
   compassion and empathy. HO

11/42 Farewell My Concubine (1993)

   Spanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows
   two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the
   perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural
   Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the
   Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance
   both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and
   between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO

12/42 Brazil (1985)

   Originally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on
   Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point:
   one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s
   befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of
   retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the
   best sci-fi production design ever. PS
   20th Century Fox

13/42 Tokyo Story (1953)

   Pauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss
   bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that
   film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple
   story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to
   find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s
   also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the
   constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you
   watch it. HO

   and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an
   undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter
   as it is sugary; and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little
   Christmas” is anything but merry. PS

28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902)

   Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects
   techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever
   since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this
   turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the
   strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of
   story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later,
   and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still
   beautifully designed and executed. HO
   Rex Features

29/42 Out of the Past (1947)

   Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques
   Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who
   can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the
   doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka
   Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas
   as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS

30/42 His Girl Friday (1940)

   A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front
   Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it
   works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a
   moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht,
   who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary
   Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter
   trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year,
   remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged.
   HO

31/42 The Conversation (1974)

   Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking
   eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a
   career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself
   morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no
   other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in
   between the first two Godfathers. PS
   Paramount Pictures

32/42 Blow Out (1981)

   John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night,
   accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination.
   Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this
   stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's élan but also
   harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most
   delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s
   played for keeps. PS
   Filmways Pictures

33/42 City of God (2002)

   There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait
   of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and
   teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed
   in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and
   take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director
   Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity
   and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still
   shocks. HO

34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)

   The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara
   Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael
   Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a
   midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of
   disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It
   hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PS
   Rex

35/42 Raising Arizona (1987)

   The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style
   with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in
   a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being
   both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely
   couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes
   all hell to break loose. PS
   20th Century Fox

36/42 Caché (2005)

   This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s
   exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more
   about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian
   family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their
   lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading
   patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own
   past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are
   few to match it. HO
   Rex

37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004)

   Straight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help
   but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s
   phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for
   minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.
   Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action
   movie of the present millennium. PS

38/42 The General (1926)

   Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy
   might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s
   Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he
   and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union
   spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy
   of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if
   movies even need sound. HO
   Rex

39/42 The Babadook (2014)

   The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your
   door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him.
   Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his
   book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman)
   before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast
   of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks.
   PS

40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989)

   Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is
   according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic
   New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner
   and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody
   Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating
   ("I'll have what she's having"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy
   Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers.
   Columbia Pictures

41/42 Inside Out (2015)

   Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best
   opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s
   head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a
   family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure
   through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely
   separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on
   a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think
   and feel. It’s wonderful.

42/42 True Romance (1993)

   Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called
   The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born
   Killers – Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a
   damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based
   on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on
   the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash
   – and totally brilliant.
   Rex

   With that in mind, should Avatar 2 and 3 struggle at the box office, it
   seems Cameron’s franchise might not have the ending he envisioned.

   Avatar 2 is set to premiere on December 18, 2020, and Avatar 3 will
   release a year later on December 17, 2021.

Avatar 4 and 5: James Cameron sequels might not be happening

   The final two films in the filmmaker's franchise were reportedly never
   certain

   James Cameron may be hard at work on his four Avatar sequels, however,
   the final two instalments might not even see the light of day.

   With production now complete on Avatar 2 and 3, it’s been revealed that
   Cameron is waiting to officially receive the go-ahead for Avatar 4 and
   5.

   Whether or not Cameron will be given free rein to see out his creative
   vision is said to become more apparent toward the end of the month,
   following the completion of the forthcoming Disney-Fox merger.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.

   Despite the four sequels being confirmed in 2017, CinemaBlend reports
   that Avatar 4 and 5 were never certain. Instead, Fox had decided to
   wait and see whether the second and third outings did well at the box
   office before permitting Cameron to direct any more.

     * Avatar 2, 3, 4 & 5 officially start production with $1 billion
       budget

   Following the merger, that decision will fall to Disney. According to
   Geek Tyrant, this could help Cameron’s cause considering “Pandora – The
   World of Avatar” theme park is part of Walt Disney World.

   Analysts estimate Cameron will spend upwards of $1 billion if the
   fourth and fifth outings are confirmed.

   Previously talking about the project, Cameron said: “The thing is, my
   focus isn’t on Avatar 2. It’s on Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5 equally. That’s
   exactly how I’m approaching it.“

1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)

   With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven
   Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically
   perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out
   of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s
   casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's
   finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot,
   interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still
   inspires. HO
   Rex

2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997)

   Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the
   darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped
   Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a
   leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes
   the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the
   Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart
   out at the end. PS
   Miramax Films

3/42 Spirited Away (2001)

   Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with
   their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines
   (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest,
   especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job
   in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her
   parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted
   interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination
   with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s
   unparalleled. HO
   Toho

4/42 Un Chien Andalou (1928)

   Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this
   16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with
   the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and
   the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage,
   which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS

5/42 Avengers (2012)

   Yes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel
   risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice,
   something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the
   fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens
   look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear
   how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult
   it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this
   scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO
   Marvel Studios

6/42 The Shining (1980)

   Stanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible
   images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence
   stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is
   the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an
   isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly
   desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as
   delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin
   and stay there. HO
   Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

7/42 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)

   One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s
   beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller
   translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit
   of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious
   health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the
   hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS

8/42 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)

   Wes Anderson's meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are
   not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a
   more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene
   Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making
   one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in
   support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as
   family life itself. HO
   Buena Vista Pictures

9/42 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)

   David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a
   filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before
   starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles –
   notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll
   that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab
   characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling
   filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO
   Rex

10/42 Bicycle Thieves (1948)

   A devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s
   neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto
   Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a
   bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate
   measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in
   circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in
   compassion and empathy. HO
   Rex Features

11/42 Farewell My Concubine (1993)

   Spanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows
   two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the
   perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural
   Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the
   Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance
   both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and
   between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO
   Miramax Films

12/42 Brazil (1985)

   Originally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on
   Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point:
   one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s
   befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of
   retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the
   best sci-fi production design ever. PS
   20th Century Fox

13/42 Tokyo Story (1953)

   Pauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss
   bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that
   film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple
   story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to
   find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s
   also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the
   constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you
   watch it. HO
   Rex Features

14/42 Double Indemnity (1944)

   If we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts
   never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when
   Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara
   Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme
   gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s
   ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition
   as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO
   Rex Features

15/42 Days of Heaven (1978)

   Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a
   mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in
   1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and
   Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a
   rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding
   magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies
   heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PS
   Paramount Pictures

16/42 Citizen Kane (1941)

   The problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is
   that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the
   technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s
   masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s
   more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and
   the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it
   ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media
   manipulation all too believable. HO

17/42 Les Enfants du Paradis (1945)

   Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in
   Marcel Carné's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only
   represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a
   gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s
   peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll
   ever see. PS
   Rex Features

18/42 Rear Window (1954)

   Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or
   simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb
   example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s
   photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the
   lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually
   vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that
   simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the
   tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the
   lion’s mouth. HO

19/42 It Happened One Night (1934)

   Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his
   uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall
   for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the
   love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry,
   hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to
   hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of
   its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big
   five at the Oscars. PS

20/42 Hoop Dreams (1994)

   The trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us
   volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about
   the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of
   inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve
   James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports
   doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will
   never quite live down failing to nominate it. PS
   Kartemquin Films

21/42 The Apartment (1960)

   This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration
   of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into
   bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going.
   While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better,
   it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek
   office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he
   carries entire scenes without a word. HO
   Rex

22/42 Paris, Texas (1984)

   The title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both
   a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean
   Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek
   to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious
   to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window.
   Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it's a
   mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will
   twang its way into your soul. PS

23/42 Synedoche, New York (2008)

   It’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman
   identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a
   lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a
   play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie
   Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love,
   death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a
   shattering experience for the faithful. PS
   Sony Pictures Classics

24/42 Before Midnight (2013)

   Céline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since
   the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before
   Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their
   lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly
   pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film
   squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term
   relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting
   the course. PS

25/42 Le Mépris (1963)

   Other Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But
   this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of
   filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on
   Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell
   art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his
   beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an
   incessant, pained ballet. PS

26/42 Casablanca (1942)

   Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca’s quality
   bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two
   former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them
   apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of
   cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an
   iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable
   cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO

27/42 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)

   On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all
   sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing
   and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an
   undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter
   as it is sugary; and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little
   Christmas” is anything but merry. PS
   Rex

28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902)

   Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects
   techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever
   since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this
   turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the
   strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of
   story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later,
   and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still
   beautifully designed and executed. HO
   Rex Features

29/42 Out of the Past (1947)

   Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques
   Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who
   can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the
   doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka
   Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas
   as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS

30/42 His Girl Friday (1940)

   A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front
   Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it
   works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a
   moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht,
   who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary
   Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter
   trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year,
   remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged.
   HO

31/42 The Conversation (1974)

   Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking
   eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a
   career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself
   morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no
   other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in
   between the first two Godfathers. PS
   Paramount Pictures

32/42 Blow Out (1981)

   John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night,
   accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination.
   Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this
   stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's élan but also
   harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most
   delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s
   played for keeps. PS
   Filmways Pictures

33/42 City of God (2002)

   There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait
   of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and
   teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed
   in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and
   take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director
   Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity
   and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still
   shocks. HO

34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)

   The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara
   Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael
   Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a
   midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of
   disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It
   hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PS
   Rex

35/42 Raising Arizona (1987)

   The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style
   with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in
   a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being
   both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely
   couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes
   all hell to break loose. PS
   20th Century Fox

36/42 Caché (2005)

   This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s
   exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more
   about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian
   family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their
   lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading
   patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own
   past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are
   few to match it. HO
   Rex

37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004)

   Straight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help
   but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s
   phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for
   minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.
   Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action
   movie of the present millennium. PS

38/42 The General (1926)

   Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy
   might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s
   Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he
   and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union
   spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy
   of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if
   movies even need sound. HO
   Rex

39/42 The Babadook (2014)

   The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your
   door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him.
   Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his
   book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman)
   before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast
   of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks.
   PS

40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989)

   Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is
   according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic
   New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner
   and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody
   Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating
   ("I'll have what she's having"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy
   Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers.
   Columbia Pictures

41/42 Inside Out (2015)

   Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best
   opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s
   head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a
   family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure
   through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely
   separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on
   a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think
   and feel. It’s wonderful.
   Getty

42/42 True Romance (1993)

   Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called
   The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born
   Killers – Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a
   damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based
   on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on
   the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash
   – and totally brilliant.
   Rex

1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)

   With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven
   Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically
   perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out
   of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s
   casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's
   finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot,
   interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still
   inspires. HO

2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997)

   Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the
   darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped
   Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a
   leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes
   the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the
   Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart
   out at the end. PS
   Miramax Films

3/42 Spirited Away (2001)

   Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with
   their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines
   (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest,
   especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job
   in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her
   parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted
   interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination
   with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s
   unparalleled. HO
   Toho

4/42 Un Chien Andalou (1928)

   Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this
   16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with
   the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and
   the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage,
   which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS

5/42 Avengers (2012)

   Yes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel
   risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice,
   something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the
   fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens
   look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear
   how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult
   it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this
   scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO
   Marvel Studios

6/42 The Shining (1980)

   Stanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible
   images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence
   stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is
   the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an
   isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly
   desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as
   delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin
   and stay there. HO
   Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

7/42 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)

   One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s
   beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller
   translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit
   of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious
   health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the
   hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS

8/42 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)

   Wes Anderson's meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are
   not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a
   more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene
   Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making
   one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in
   support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as
   family life itself. HO
   Buena Vista Pictures

9/42 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)

   David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a
   filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before
   starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles –
   notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll
   that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab
   characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling
   filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO
   Rex

10/42 Bicycle Thieves (1948)

   A devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s
   neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto
   Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a
   bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate
   measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in
   circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in
   compassion and empathy. HO
   Rex Features

11/42 Farewell My Concubine (1993)

   Spanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows
   two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the
   perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural
   Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the
   Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance
   both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and
   between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO
   Miramax Films

12/42 Brazil (1985)

   Originally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on
   Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point:
   one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s
   befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of
   retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the
   best sci-fi production design ever. PS
   20th Century Fox

13/42 Tokyo Story (1953)

   Pauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss
   bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that
   film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple
   story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to
   find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s
   also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the
   constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you
   watch it. HO
   Rex Features

14/42 Double Indemnity (1944)

   If we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts
   never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when
   Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara
   Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme
   gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s
   ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition
   as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO
   Rex Features

15/42 Days of Heaven (1978)

   Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a
   mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in
   1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and
   Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a
   rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding
   magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies
   heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PS
   Paramount Pictures

16/42 Citizen Kane (1941)

   The problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is
   that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the
   technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s
   masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s
   more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and
   the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it
   ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media
   manipulation all too believable. HO

17/42 Les Enfants du Paradis (1945)

   Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in
   Marcel Carné's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only
   represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a
   gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s
   peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll
   ever see. PS
   Rex Features

18/42 Rear Window (1954)

   Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or
   simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb
   example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s
   photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the
   lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually
   vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that
   simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the
   tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the
   lion’s mouth. HO

19/42 It Happened One Night (1934)

   Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his
   uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall
   for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the
   love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry,
   hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to
   hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of
   its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big
   five at the Oscars. PS

20/42 Hoop Dreams (1994)

   The trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us
   volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about
   the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of
   inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve
   James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports
   doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will
   never quite live down failing to nominate it. PS
   Kartemquin Films

21/42 The Apartment (1960)

   This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration
   of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into
   bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going.
   While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better,
   it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek
   office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he
   carries entire scenes without a word. HO
   Rex

22/42 Paris, Texas (1984)

   The title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both
   a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean
   Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek
   to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious
   to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window.
   Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it's a
   mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will
   twang its way into your soul. PS

23/42 Synedoche, New York (2008)

   It’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman
   identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a
   lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a
   play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie
   Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love,
   death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a
   shattering experience for the faithful. PS
   Sony Pictures Classics

24/42 Before Midnight (2013)

   Céline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since
   the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before
   Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their
   lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly
   pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film
   squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term
   relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting
   the course. PS

25/42 Le Mépris (1963)

   Other Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But
   this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of
   filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on
   Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell
   art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his
   beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an
   incessant, pained ballet. PS

26/42 Casablanca (1942)

   Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca’s quality
   bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two
   former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them
   apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of
   cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an
   iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable
   cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO

27/42 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)

   On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all
   sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing
   and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an
   undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter
   as it is sugary; and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little
   Christmas” is anything but merry. PS
   Rex

28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902)

   Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects
   techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever
   since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this
   turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the
   strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of
   story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later,
   and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still
   beautifully designed and executed. HO
   Rex Features

29/42 Out of the Past (1947)

   Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques
   Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who
   can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the
   doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka
   Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas
   as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS

30/42 His Girl Friday (1940)

   A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front
   Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it
   works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a
   moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht,
   who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary
   Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter
   trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year,
   remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged.
   HO

31/42 The Conversation (1974)

   Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking
   eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a
   career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself
   morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no
   other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in
   between the first two Godfathers. PS
   Paramount Pictures

32/42 Blow Out (1981)

   John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night,
   accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination.
   Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this
   stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's élan but also
   harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most
   delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s
   played for keeps. PS
   Filmways Pictures

33/42 City of God (2002)

   There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait
   of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and
   teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed
   in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and
   take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director
   Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity
   and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still
   shocks. HO

34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)

   The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara
   Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael
   Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a
   midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of
   disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It
   hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PS
   Rex

35/42 Raising Arizona (1987)

   The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style
   with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in
   a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being
   both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely
   couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes
   all hell to break loose. PS
   20th Century Fox

36/42 Caché (2005)

   This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s
   exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more
   about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian
   family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their
   lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading
   patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own
   past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are
   few to match it. HO
   Rex

37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004)

   Straight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help
   but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s
   phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for
   minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.
   Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action
   movie of the present millennium. PS

38/42 The General (1926)

   Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy
   might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s
   Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he
   and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union
   spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy
   of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if
   movies even need sound. HO
   Rex

39/42 The Babadook (2014)

   The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your
   door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him.
   Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his
   book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman)
   before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast
   of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks.
   PS

40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989)

   Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is
   according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic
   New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner
   and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody
   Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating
   ("I'll have what she's having"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy
   Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers.
   Columbia Pictures

41/42 Inside Out (2015)

   Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best
   opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s
   head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a
   family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure
   through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely
   separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on
   a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think
   and feel. It’s wonderful.
   Getty

42/42 True Romance (1993)

   Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called
   The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born
   Killers – Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a
   damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based
   on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on
   the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash
   – and totally brilliant.
   Rex

   With that in mind, should Avatar 2 and 3 struggle at the box office, it
   seems Cameron’s franchise might not have the ending he envisioned.

   Avatar 2 is set to premiere on December 18, 2020, and Avatar 3 will
   release a year later on December 17, 2021.

          Avatar 4 and 5: James Cameron sequels might not be happening

The final two films in the filmmaker's franchise were reportedly never certain

   James Cameron may be hard at work on his four Avatar sequels, however,
   the final two instalments might not even see the light of day.

   With production now complete on Avatar 2 and 3, it’s been revealed that
   Cameron is waiting to officially receive the go-ahead for Avatar 4 and
   5.

   Whether or not Cameron will be given free rein to see out his creative
   vision is said to become more apparent toward the end of the month,
   following the completion of the forthcoming Disney-Fox merger.

   Despite the four sequels being confirmed in 2017, CinemaBlend reports
   that Avatar 4 and 5 were never certain. Instead, Fox had decided to
   wait and see whether the second and third outings did well at the box
   office before permitting Cameron to direct any more.

     * James Cameron reveals why Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5 have taken so long
     * Avatar 2, 3, 4 & 5 officially start production with $1 billion
       budget

   Following the merger, that decision will fall to Disney. According to
   Geek Tyrant, this could help Cameron’s cause considering “Pandora – The
   World of Avatar” theme park is part of Walt Disney World.

   Analysts estimate Cameron will spend upwards of $1 billion if the
   fourth and fifth outings are confirmed.

   Previously talking about the project, Cameron said: “The thing is, my
   focus isn’t on Avatar 2. It’s on Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5 equally. That’s
   exactly how I’m approaching it.“

Films to watch before you die

   [Raiders-Of-The-Lost-Ark.jpg]
   With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven
   Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically
   perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out
   of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s
   casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's
   finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot,
   interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still
   inspires. HO
   [The-Wings-of-the-Dove-9.jpg]
   Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the
   darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped
   Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a
   leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes
   the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the
   Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart
   out at the end. PS
   [spirited-away.jpg]
   Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with
   their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines
   (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest,
   especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job
   in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her
   parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted
   interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination
   with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s
   unparalleled. HO
   [Un-Chien-Andalou.jpg]
   Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this
   16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with
   the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and
   the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage,
   which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS
   [the-shining-2.jpg]
   Stanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible
   images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence
   stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is
   the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an
   isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly
   desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as
   delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin
   and stay there. HO
   [Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers-poster.jpg]
   One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s
   beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller
   translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit
   of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious
   health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the
   hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS
   [The-Royal-Tenenbaums.jpg]
   Wes Anderson's meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are
   not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a
   more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene
   Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making
   one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in
   support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as
   family life itself. HO
   [pg-38-otoole-2-rex.jpg]
   David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a
   filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before
   starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles –
   notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll
   that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab
   characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling
   filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO
   [Farewell-My-Concubine.jpg]
   Spanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows
   two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the
   perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural
   Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the
   Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance
   both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and
   between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO
   [Brazil-1985.jpg]
   Originally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on
   Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point:
   one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s
   befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of
   retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the
   best sci-fi production design ever. PS
   [Tokyo-Story.jpg]
   Pauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss
   bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that
   film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple
   story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to
   find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s
   also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the
   constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you
   watch it. HO
   [Double-Indemnity.jpg]
   If we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts
   never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when
   Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara
   Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme
   gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s
   ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition
   as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO
   [Citizen-Kane.jpg]
   The problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is
   that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the
   technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s
   masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s
   more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and
   the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it
   ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media
   manipulation all too believable. HO
   [Les-Enfants-Du-Paradis.jpg]
   Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in
   Marcel Carné's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only
   represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a
   gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s
   peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll
   ever see. PS
   [Rear-Window.jpg]
   Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or
   simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb
   example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s
   photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the
   lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually
   vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that
   simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the
   tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the
   lion’s mouth. HO
   [It-Happened-One-NighT.jpg]
   Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his
   uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall
   for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the
   love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry,
   hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to
   hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of
   its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big
   five at the Oscars. PS
   [The-Apartment.jpg]
   This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration
   of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into
   bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going.
   While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better,
   it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek
   office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he
   carries entire scenes without a word. HO
   [Paris-Texas.jpg]
   The title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both
   a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean
   Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek
   to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious
   to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window.
   Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it's a
   mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will
   twang its way into your soul. PS
   [Synedoche-New-York.jpg]
   It’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman
   identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a
   lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a
   play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie
   Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love,
   death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a
   shattering experience for the faithful. PS
   [Before-Midnight.png]
   Céline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since
   the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before
   Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their
   lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly
   pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film
   squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term
   relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting
   the course. PS
   [casablanca.jpg]
   Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca’s quality
   bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two
   former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them
   apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of
   cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an
   iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable
   cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO
   [Meet-Me-In-St-Louis.jpg]
   On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all
   sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing
   and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an
   undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter
   as it is sugary; and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little
   Christmas” is anything but merry. PS
   [A-Trip-To-The-Moon.jpg]
   Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects
   techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever
   since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this
   turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the
   strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of
   story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later,
   and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still
   beautifully designed and executed. HO
   [Out-of-the-Past.jpg]
   Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques
   Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who
   can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the
   doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka
   Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas
   as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS
   [The-Conversation.png]
   Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking
   eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a
   career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself
   morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no
   other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in
   between the first two Godfathers. PS
   [Blow-Out.jpg]
   John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night,
   accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination.
   Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this
   stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's élan but also
   harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most
   delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s
   played for keeps. PS
   [City-of-God-poster.jpg]
   There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait
   of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and
   teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed
   in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and
   take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director
   Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity
   and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still
   shocks. HO
   [Hannah-And-Her-Sisters.jpg]
   The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara
   Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael
   Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a
   midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of
   disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It
   hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PS
   [cache-film.jpg]
   This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s
   exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more
   about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian
   family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their
   lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading
   patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own
   past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are
   few to match it. HO
   [The-Bourne-Supremacy.jpg]
   Straight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help
   but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s
   phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for
   minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.
   Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action
   movie of the present millennium. PS
   [The-General-1926.jpg]
   Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy
   might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s
   Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he
   and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union
   spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy
   of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if
   movies even need sound. HO
   [the-babadook-poster.jpeg]
   The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your
   door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him.
   Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his
   book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman)
   before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast
   of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks.
   PS
   [Inside-Out.jpg]
   Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best
   opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s
   head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a
   family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure
   through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely
   separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on
   a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think
   and feel. It’s wonderful.
   [true-romance-2.jpg]
   Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called
   The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born
   Killers – Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a
   damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based
   on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on
   the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash
   – and totally brilliant.

   With that in mind, should Avatar 2 and 3 struggle at the box office, it
   seems Cameron’s franchise might not have the ending he envisioned.

   Avatar 2 is set to premiere on December 18, 2020, and Avatar 3 will
   release a year later on December 17, 2021.
