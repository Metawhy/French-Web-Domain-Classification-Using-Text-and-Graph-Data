All-new Toyota Corolla hybrid

   Stylish, efficient and a joy to drive, the new Corolla is an icon for
   the modern age. Whatever your lifestyle and whichever body type you
   choose, you'll benefit from self-charging hybrid powertrains.This is
   the first time Toyota has offered a choice of two Hybrid engines - a
   1.8 litre Hybrid and a 2.0 litre Hybrid Dynamic Force engine - for the
   same model. With all the advantages of the Toyota New Global
   Architecture (TNGA) platform, Corolla takes you on a spirited drive.
   Watch video

The start of an exciting new era for the world’s best-selling car.

   Enjoy the car that makes driving fun. Feel the difference as soon as
   you get behind the wheel, with its stylish interior, excellent handling
   and stability making the drive even more rewarding.
     * 01

Built to deliver more
       At Toyota, we’re committed to making ever better cars. Corolla is
       built on Toyota’s advanced new TNGA engineering platform,
       delivering a truly satisfying drive. A more rigid body and low
       centre of gravity come together to reduce body roll when cornering,
       while the double wishbone suspension absorbs shocks more
       effectively, for a smoother ride.
     * 02

Designed to impress
       The first thing you notice about the new Corolla is its bold and
       dynamic exterior, which can be made even more eye-catching with a
       selection from our bi-tone paint options. An attractive low bonnet,
       a striking wide grille and distinctive all-LED headlamps gives it a
       sleek profile, which is enhanced by sporty 18" alloy wheels.
     * 03

A sense of style
       Our designers have chosen a combination of high quality materials
       that look stunning together – and also provide a pleasing variety
       of textures. An all-black look gives the interior a sporty feel, or
       you can choose a cool grey that underlines the spacious and
       uncluttered design. Stylish sport seats complete the look
       perfectly.

Discover the world's best-selling car

   An exciting journey lies ahead, as an icon becomes a hybrid.
   You'll love the spirited drive of the new Corolla

You'll love the spirited drive of the new Corolla

   Toyota Hybrids are a pleasure to drive. Spirited and responsive in the
   city, the 1.8 litre Hybrid engine provides a relaxed drive. The new 2.0
   litre Hybrid Dynamic Force engine delivers even more power without
   compromising on the smooth drive. Whichever you choose, both save fuel
   and reduce emissions, falling to zero when you drive on electric power
   alone.
   Sit back and relax

Sit back and relax

   The cabin of the new Corolla has been designed around your comfort.
   Sport seats wrap around you to hold you firmly in place, keeping you
   comfortable on long journeys. The steering position has been designed
   to feel as natural as possible, helping to avoid fatigue.
   Steering-wheel mounted switches for driving, infotainment and audio
   controls let you keep your hands in one place, while a steering wheel
   heater keeps them warm on cold days.
   Safety is never just an option – it’s standard

Safety is never just an option – it’s standard

   Toyota Safety Sense is standard across every Corolla, because your
   safety is essential. This unique safety system includes an array of
   updated safety features that makes driving easier, while keeping you

FLOW THROUGH URBAN LIFE

   Created by engineers with racing spirit in their veins, the Toyota C-HR
   responds with the agility of a dynamic hatchback with the comforts of
   an SUV. Step on the gas and immediately feel the acceleration; turn the
   wheel and Toyota C-HR’s response and linearity is tangible; and with
   Toyota Safety Sense technologies, you'll feel protected no matter the
   conditions.

CRAFTED AROUND YOU

   Leather seats, premium finish – every part of the Toyota C-HR’s
   interior is totally unique and every part flows beautifully into the
   next. The cabin silhouettes extend seamlessly into the cockpit putting
   you in control. There’s just one focus inside the Toyota C-HR: you.

FLOW MOTION

   Flow intelligently through life with the smooth, efficient hybrid
   drive. With its ﬂuid and controlled responses, you’ll feel at one with
   the city.
