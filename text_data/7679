   Happy Earth Day! Itâ€™s time for a reality check. Polar expedition
   photographer @johnbozinov knows the Antarctic better than most and he
   can see climate change warming Antarctica at an accelerating rate
   before his eyes. The animals who live here are already living in the
   worldâ€™s most extreme environment, struggling to survive on the absolute
   edge of what life can tolerate. The added pressure of human-induced
   climate change is changing their environment at a rate that is too fast
   for them to adapt and many simply canâ€™t survive. The only way to fix
   the problem is to embrace renewable energy and radically transform our
   lifestyles. The tide is turning and itâ€™s time for change.

   The first ever image of a black hole was revealed this morning. Itâ€™s
   6.5 billion times the mass of the sun and over 55 million light-years
   from @earth. Black holes generate a gravity field so powerful that
   nothing can escape their pull â€“ including visible light. This photo
   shows the vortex of gas, dust, stars and light itself being sucked into
   the black hole to never emerge again.
