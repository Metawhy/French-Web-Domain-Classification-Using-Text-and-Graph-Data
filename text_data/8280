December Week 4: Pam Cooking Spray, Shortening

   This week's food storage items are:
   December Week 4: Pam cooking spray, shortening
   [food+storage+pam+004.JPG]
   If you use Pam (any of the varieties), figure out about what you might
   use in a year. Of course, this is only an estimate, but you can
   probably make a pretty educated guess. Do the same with shortening.
   Once you've come up a with a number for both items, write it on a
   shopping list, and go out in the next few days and pick up whatever you
   may need for the year. Once you have the items home, put them on your
   food storage shelves, and update your inventory sheet to reflect the
   new numbers.
   Now since there are 5-ish weeks in December, next week will be a rest
   (or catch up) week. And then, we'll start all over again with January.
   Remember, this is never a job that is completely done. To have a good
   food storage with little waste, you will be purchasing and rotating
   constantly. But really, who doesn't have 15 minutes a week to handle
   that? That literally is all it takes. 15 minutes. Sooooo do-able!
   And remember... we started working on the 72-hour kits. In about the
   middle of January, we'll continue on with the next step. For now, click
   on the 72-hour kit tab above to see where we are, and to catch up.
   There is still time, but try to get caught up by January 10 so you're
   ready for the next step.

   week's items. It also has the information as to how you can get a copy

December Week 3: Hand-crank radio

   This week's emergency prep item is:
   December Week 3: Hand-crank radio
   [hand-crank+radio+002.JPG]
   This is one of those great weeks where once you've got the item, it's
   done. Next year, when this week comes up again, you shouldn't have to
   rotate it or refill it. That's why I've put it on week 3 of December. I
   figured you just may have other things to do that week. :)
   There are several different types and price-ranges out there. I
   obviously haven't tried them all, so I can only go by what I've got for
   my own emergency supply. I already had a Voyager Dynamo & Solar V1
   Radio. It can be powered by battery, solar power, and/or by
   hand-cranking. It also has a bright LED flashlight. This year I bought
   another one that is a bit larger, and can also charge a cell phone. So,
   I'll keep one with my 72-hour kit, and the other in my emergency supply
   closet.
   The smaller one (shown in the above photo) was about $30.00.
   The specs are as follows:
   Solar / hand-cranking powered radio flashlight with a USB outlet for
   your electronic devices. The compact Voyager V1™ radio offers multiple
   benefits all bundled together. Get standard AM/FM stations as well as
   shortwave bands to receive stations from around the world. The built-in
   flashlight add additional convenience and functionality. A USB outlet
   powers many handheld electronics like most smart phones (does NOT
   charge Apple devices).
   Radio dimensions: 13 x 6 x 5 cm
     * 1 Minute of cranking powers up to 15 minutes of radio listening or
       1 hour of light
     * A built-in USB port lets you charge your small USB-rechargeable
       device like smart phones (Does NOT charge apple products)
     * Bands include AM/FM, and Shortwave
     * Super-bright, 3-LED flashlight
     * Built in HD speaker and earphone jack

   The Voyager V1 can be powered by multiple sources. You can recharge an
   internal Ni-MH battery via the built-in solar panel OR cranking dynamo.
   The battery can also be recharged by a USB outlet using a mini-USB to
   standard USB cable (not included). The V1 can also be powered by 3
   standard AAA batteries.
   And this is the larger one:
   [Solar%2Bpowered%2Bradio%2Band%2Bcharger.JPG]
   For the larger one, which was $45.00 on sale, the specs are:

     This radio is durable, yet lightweight with a rubberized body that is
   water resistant<./li>

     NOAA stands for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

     When using the NOAA Weather Alert, it is recommended that the radio
   is plugged into a power source through the USB Port (In) or AC Adapter
   3.5 mm jack (AC adapter not included)

     One minute of winding will give roughly 12 minutes of radio play

     The optional AA batteries cannot be recharged in the radio, only the
   internal Ni-MH battery is rechargeable.

     6 ways to power the Radio: Hand Crank Dynamo, Solar Panel, USB Power
   In, AC Power In, 3 AA Batteries, Built-in Rechargeable Ni-MH Battery.

     Red or Green LED lights on the front of the radio indicate when the
   radio is on or when the batteries are low

     3 lighting options: 5 LED reading lamp lights (under solar panel),
   white LED light, flashlight red S.O.S. LED for emergencies - See more

   Weight: 1.22 lbs. (19.5 oz.) Dimensions: 5.5” high x 8” wide x 2” thick
   Radio Size: 8” x 5” x 2.6” Radio Ports:
     * Earphone Jack
     * USB Port Charge Out (Many cellphones, mp3 player, etc.) Charge
       Built-in Battery
     * AC Adapter 3.5 mm Jack (adapter sold separately)

   Radio Reception:
     * AM: 520-1710 KHz
     * FM: 87.00-108.00 MHz

     * Weather Band: 7 Pre-set Channels

   http://beprepared.com/kaito-black-voyager.html#sthash.5i0IkbVt.dpuf
   I'm sure there are many different hand-crank radios on the market. It
   would be smart to do some research and find the one that best suits
   your needs.
   After I got mine and saw what a nice small size it is, I thought it
   would be a great idea for stocking stuffers for my married kids. Hmmmm.
   Once you've acquired your hand-crank radio, update your Inventory
   Sheets and then sit back and relax and enjoy your holiday. Remember,
   this is a week-by-week plan, so you can jump in whenever. I received an
   email from a reader last week asking if it started in January, and
   though the lists do go from January through December, you can start the
   plan anytime throughout the year without having to back up and "make up
   for lost time". It really is an easy, manageable plan that is
   completely do-able even for the busiest families. You can adjust it to
   your needs as your family's size changes. We have adjusted through the
   years quite easily. As you adjust and buy more or less what your family
   really uses in a year (and rotate, as planned), you will have less
   waste at the end of the year. Yay!

December Week 2: Popcorn - microwave and regular

   This week's food storage items are:
   December Week 2: Popcorn - microwave and regular kernels
   [food+storage+popcorn+001.JPG]
   You may be wondering... Why popcorn? I've purposely put popcorn in
   December because it makes it a very easy food storage week (which, for
   me, is a necessary thing in December). And if you don't really eat
   popcorn at all in your home, then you're free and easy this week. Which
   means you can do one of three things: scratch "food storage" off your
   list for the week, and just do Christmas shopping; or, you can catch up
   on a previous week that may not have been completed; or, you can take a
   few minutes to organize your food storage shelves.
   Now, if your family eats popcorn, then figure out what you use in a
   year's time and get to the store and pick up the popcorn. Then, add the
   popcorn to your food storage shelves, and update your inventory sheets.
   It's that simple!
   Before you completely dismiss popcorn as a food storage item, check out
   the article included below, from USA Emergency Supply. (to read the
   entire original article, click on USA Emergency Supply). Note also that
   popcorn, if stored properly, can last 10-15 years. You can buy it
   canned, online from food storage warehouses.
   "You may have considered popcorn to be junk-food. However, it actually
   supplies a lot of nutrition and is suggested as a snack by the National
   Cancer Institute (NCI), the American Dental Association (ADA) and the
   American Dietetic Association (ADA). Popcorn contains substantial
   amounts of carbohydrates, fiber, many of the B vitamins, Potassium,
   Phosphorus, Magnesium, Iron, Zinc, Pantothenic acid, Copper, Manganese,
   Linoleic acid and all the essential amino acids. And for how
   inexpensive popcorn is, popcorn will give you very good nutritional
   bang for the buck in your food storage or every-day eating. It's
   inexpensive, easy to pop and great fun to eat.
   Hints for getting the best popped corn: Don't pop popcorn in butter as
   the butter will burn before it can get hot enough. Popcorn pops best in
   temperatures of 400-460 degrees F. If your oil starts to smoke which
   happens at 500 degrees F, you've got it too hot. Any oil will work. Use
   enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. For your health, you should
   choose a light cooking oil or better yet, skip the oil all together and
   use an air popper. The movie houses use yellow dyed coconut oil which
   does a great job of popping the popcorn although there are healthier
   oils you can use than coconut oil. To see if you have the oil hot
   enough, drop a couple of kernels into the hot oil. If it's hot enough,
   they should pop in just a few seconds. If you don't have a popper, any
   thick bottomed, high walled pan will do. Popcorn can even be easily
   made in a Dutch oven over a camp fire. When your oil is the right
   temperature, pour in your popcorn, shaking the pan to cover all the
   seeds in oil. Do this with the lid on to prevent burns should the hot
   oil try to splash out of the pan. Using a lid helps the kernels to heat
   more evenly and keeps the popping corn from flying all over the place.
   (If you are using a popcorn popper, shaking it isn't necessary because
   of it's rounded bottom.) As it begins popping, it's important to
   continue to shake a flat-bottomed pan. This helps any un-popped kernels
   to settle to the bottom of the pan where they can pop. As soon as you
   hear the popcorn stop popping, pull the pan off the heat and pour the
   popcorn into another container. It will burn if you leave it in the hot
   pan."

December Week 1: Matches, 100 hour candles, 12 hour light sticks

   This week's food storage items are:
   December Week 1: Matches, 100 hour candles, 12 hour light sticks
   [food+storage+and+chipboard+letters+005.JPG]
   We are getting to the end of the year! Now for those of you who have
   been following, and thinking you'll start on January 1, that isn't how
   this plan works. Start today! You can start anywhere at all during the
   year, and continue through. It isn't a plan that actually has an end,
   since every week from here til kingdom come, you'll be checking on (and
   updating, if necessary) your food storage and emergency supply. It's
   the only way to have a supply that is current and isn't full of expired
   goods. Sooooo, get started this very week!
   This happens to be one of those weeks where once you have it done, you
   shouldn't have to rotate or replenish it (as long as you haven't used
   any of your stock). It's handy to have a week like this scheduled at
   the beginning of December when life is a tiny bit crazy.
   The large can in the photo is one of two emergency cooking candles that
   I made years ago at homemaking night (that tells you how long ago it
   was). I wish I had the instructions, but I wasn't teaching the class,
   so I just came home with the cooking candles. I can tell you that the
   candle is made of sawdust and wax (a messy process), and has a wick
   down the center of it. The theory is that you can use it to cook over
   in an emergency. I haven't had to use them yet, but they are there,
   waiting just in case!
   The other items I have are the 100-hour candles from Emergency
   Essentials (on line). They are around $5.00, which seems pretty
   affordable for 100 hours of light. I'm pretty sure that in an
   emergency, I would pay the $5.00 to have light that I could rely on. I
   like the idea of having those around.
   Don't forget the matches. Buy a few good-sized boxes and keep them with
   the candles on your emergency supply shelves.
   I also have some light sticks. I think these might come in handy in a
   lot of different ways. These are also available at Emergency
   Essentials.
   Since these are items that you won't rotate through, you'll need to
   think of them in a different way. How many do you think you'll need in
   an emergency situation? If you didn't have electricity for several days
   or weeks, what might you need on your shelves? It's difficult to guess,
   but at least get some of the items on your shelves, and you can add to
   them later on, if you feel the need.
   Now, I have seen a few other sources on Pinterest of ways to use
   household items as candles. This one, in particular, caught my eye.
   Since most of us have crayons somewhere in our homes, I thought this
   might be one to try out. In the particular Pin that I saw, it said that
   crayons will burn for 30 minutes. So, I figured it would be worth a
   try. I got a crayon, and secured it with a clothespin, and then put it
   in a pie tin.
   [food+storage+and+chipboard+letters+007.JPG]
   It took a few tries to get it to light, but it finally did light. And
   the flame actually grew to about 6" in height. (Yikes)
   [food+storage+and+chipboard+letters+009.JPG]
   Five minutes later, it went out in a flash.
   [food+storage+and+chipboard+letters+010.JPG]
   So, if you are relying on crayons for your emergency light source, you
   may have to buy several boxes of them, since the flame only lasts for
   about 5 minutes.
   I think I'll stick with the 100-hour candles. :)

Week-By-Week Food Storage Plan: Bye Week

   This is one of those rare weeks (4 times a year) that you will have
   nothing new to do. There are only 4 weekly assignments per month, so
   there are times when there is an extra week with nothing to do. Yay!
   Use this week to get caught up on previous weeks, or to straighten up
   your storage closet. Or do nothing at all. Next week we start with
   December, and we're in the home stretch!

  November Week 4: Potatoes: buds, pearls, scalloped, etc.

   This week's food storage items are:
   November Week 4: Potatoes: buds, pearls, scalloped, etc.
   [Christmas+stockings,+etc+008.JPG]
   Let's first talk about long-term storage. The potato flakes you see in
   the can in the photo, are from the Family Home Storage Center, and I
   dry-packed them myself. They last 30+ years. You add milk, butter and
   salt, as well as hot water, but since I have all of those items in
   long-term storage, it should work out just fine. I like these potatoes
   really well, so we are able to use them in a pinch. But, since they
   have such a long shelf life, there really isn't much need to rotate
   through them at this point. You can order these by the 6-can case by
   clicking here.
   The other package is also from the Family Home Storage Center, but
   these already have the milk and butter incorporated into them. You only
   have to add hot water to them. Since they have the fats in them, they
   have a much shorter shelf life. These generally last a year or so. That
   means that these ones I definitely have to rotate through. Again, they
   make a good mashed potato, and I generally would much rather whip up a
   batch of these than go through the rigors of making mashed potatoes
   from scratch. But that's just me.
   Also, if you use any other sort of potato that is boxed, such as
   scalloped, this would be the time that you would re-stock your shelves.
   These have a shorter shelf life as well, so take that into
   consideration.
   Now, decide your family's needs for potatoes. If you have a Family Home
   Storage Center nearby (to locate the Centers, click here), I would
   encourage you to make a visit. You can buy the instant potatoes there
   easily, and sometimes they even have some Potato Flakes canned and
   ready for the taking. Even if you have to can your own, it is a quick
   and fun process to learn. To see an order form of all that is available
   at the center when you visit, click here.
   If you don't have access to a Center nearby, you can look into
   Emergency Essentials, or any other on-line provider of food storage
   items. I haven't ever ordered potatoes from any of them, so you're on
   your own with that venture.
   Otherwise, you can do a shorter term storage and be sure to rotate
   through before they expire in a year's time. After you have your list
   of items to purchase, buy them the next time you are in a grocery
   store, and get the items on your shelves. Update your Inventory Sheets,
   and sit back and enjoy Thanksgiving with your family!
