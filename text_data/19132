Fieldwork Fail: When Science Goes Messy by Jim Jourdane

   Posted on May 8, 2019 by ELA teacher

   You can buy this book for 75% off. See details below.

   This is the end ‚Äì I‚Äôm stopping selling Fieldwork Fail !

   The book ¬´ Fieldwork Fail ¬ª was a huge success. Hundreds of people from
   more than 50 country ‚Äì you ‚Äì made this beautiful project happen. Word
   to mouth is excellent and many people from dozens of countries told me
   they love the book.

   Still I have an issue right now :/

   I need to close my shop, where I was selling the book. With my books
   still in it.

   After the crowdfunding, I wanted the book available later on for more
   people.

   To distribute them, finding a publisher could have been a choice. But
   talking with them made me remember why I had avoided them in the first
   place‚Ä¶

   Another possibility could have been to sell directly on Amazon. As a
   customer, Amazon makes things easy, reliable and fast.

   But there were some points I had issues with: Amazon is in monopoly
   situation and strangle independant book stores, the company doesn‚Äôt
   even pay its taxes, the working conditions of employees are poor, and
   as a seller Amazon is complex and bureaucratic.

   So, that wasn‚Äôt my favorite model either. Was any alternative possible?
   Amazon seems to be difficult to avoid when you talk about selling
   books, but I decided to run an alternative anyway, ¬´ for a couple of
   months ¬ª.

   I opened a website, makisapa.com, and connected the store to an
   independant fulfillment company. I shipped a palet of books in USA and
   in UK so that people there could get the book faster in these
   countries, but with also the possibility to ship the book anywhere in
   the world. So when you ordered a book in my store, a guy in USA or UK
   was shipping the book directly to your address, and I could focus on
   other projects instead of having to ship myself books every two days.

   This alternative that was just an experiment worked actually for one
   year and a half! Hundreds of people bought the book in this shop.

   Ok, it worked with the exception that for many other people, there is
   nothing outside Amazon. Your book doesn‚Äôt seem to even have an
   existence if it‚Äôs not listed in their platform.

   So, after this experience, is it possible to make a book ignoring
   Amazon?

   It is but it‚Äôs difficult. This independant distribution worked well for
   selling the book ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù but killed the idea of promoting it
   outside this word-of-mouth area.

   Still, this independant distribution was effective, and allowed to
   hundreds of people to order the book !

   ‚Ä¶Just enough to make me do a second print.

   A few months later, the sales of the store were just covering the
   storage fees.

   I could live with the status quo, but the fulfillment company contacted
   me two weeks ago.

   What is worse than having a huge pile of books on your hands ?

   Having a big pile of books on your hands‚Ä¶ thousands of miles away,
   without any places to store them. And with a countdown!

   Sure, there are others fulfillment companies, but in the long term, I‚Äôm
   not sure that the sales will cover the storage and others fees anyway.

   I contacted again publishers.

   Printing wasn‚Äôt that expensive but it was great quality, printed in
   Belgium ‚Äì the specialists of comic books in Europe. As the Kickstarter
   was successful, I made sure to have the best printing quality I could
   get. And I don‚Äôt regret it, they made an awesome work!

   The only conclusion right now: I have the urgent need to reduce this
   huge supply of quality-printed books to make everything easier to
   handle!

   To do so, I will sell the english version of Fieldwork Fail, during the
   next 10 days, with a 75% discount, on my store.

   Thereafter, I will close my shop, end international shipping, and will
   just keep some copies (at the regular price) in Amazon.com (not many
   alternatives ‚Äì I want to keep the book available and show that it does
   exist! If you have an Amazon account, of course don‚Äôt hesitate to leave
   a comment about the book.

   So, if you know colleagues, friends who could be interested, if you
   have a point of sale and want to sell the book, if you want to offer a
   copy to your school‚Äôs library or at the cafeteria of your university‚Ä¶
   The book is available for 10 days for just a quarter of the original
   price.

   Shipping won‚Äôt be free but will be the same whatever the number of
   copies.

   I want to finish with better news üôÇ

   I may have been a bit too optimistic or ambitious on the English
   version but all other versions of the book are doing great!

   ‚Äì The book in France is simpler to manage! Here too, I printed a lot of
   copies, but as they have been distributed in book stores with a proper
   release, unlike his English-speaking cousin, new readers are buying the
   book over time, month after month, thanks to a great media coverage and
   excellent word of mouth. It‚Äôs the opposite: I arrive soon at the end of
   the stock and need now to make a new print!

   The book has even been selected for two French awards: La Science se
   Livre and Le Gout des Sciences. Ok, eventually I didn‚Äôt get these
   awards but it was already awesome to be selected ‚Äì the book was even
   finalist in these two prizes!

   ‚Äì The book is now in german and portuguese! Published by Verlag Ludwig
   in Germany and Blutcher in Brazil. That makes an happy family of books!

   Also, I have several ongoing projects that I will likely talk about in
   the next news.

   Thank you for reading me this far!

4 Mistakes I Made Trying to Raise a Middle School Reader by Kari Ness Riedel

   Posted on February 10, 2019 by ELA teacher

   As a self-proclaimed book lover, raising kids who love to read is a
   high priority. As soon as my son, Gabe, was born, snuggling up with a
   book at bedtime became an important ritual for us. He was an early
   reader, and throughout elementary school, he spent hours poring over
   books every week. When he entered middle school, however, his interest
   in reading for fun declined dramatically.

   Here are a few mistakes I‚Äôve made in my efforts to ensure he continues
   to read for pleasure as he gets older ‚Äî and some adjustments that our
   family is making together to correct them.

   Mistake #1: Not making time for reading.
   Like many kids today, Gabe is busy. He plays competitive baseball,
   he‚Äôll soon be a Kuk Sool Won black belt, and he has a considerable
   amount of homework every night. These passions and interests make him
   happy, but they‚Äôre time-consuming. It seems like there‚Äôs little time
   left for reading, especially since ‚Äúread for 20 minutes‚Äù is no longer
   in his evening homework assignment as it was in elementary school.

   My mistake was in accepting this busyness and not encouraging him to
   find the time to read. Recently, we did a family assessment of what we
   value and compared it with how we spend our time. Reading and learning
   about the world were at the top of our values list, so we looked more
   closely at Gabe‚Äôs schedule to see where he could find extra time to
   read. Those 15 minutes on Instagram, the 45 minutes watching baseball
   videos on YouTube, that half-hour waiting for his brother to finish
   practice ‚Äî all were potential opportunities to read. We now help Gabe
   identify those windows of time and use them to work in additional
   reading.

   Mistake #2: Pushing my literary interests instead of his.
   Gabe and I shared a love of the Harry Potter series, so I assumed he
   would jump on my recommendation to read The Mysterious Benedict
   Society. Um, no. He became interested in that book only when his friend
   told him about it. For a while, I pushed classics and other books I
   wanted him to read, but was continually met with disinterest and even
   opposition in return. Wrong approach. What does work is making time for
   him to browse the shelves at our local bookstore and library and
   encouraging him to talk with friends about what they‚Äôre reading. Also,
   honoring his interests and what he wants to read ‚Äî dystopian sci-fi and
   magazines like Sports Illustrated Kids, for example ‚Äî has gotten better
   results than my pushing him toward books I think he should read. Seeing
   the power of peer recommendations even led me to create Bookopolis, a
   digital platform where kids can swap book recommendations with friends
   and explore peer reviews to find books they are excited to read.

   Mistake #3: Not reading aloud to a child who knows how to read.
   Before my son could read independently, read-aloud time with Mom was as
   important as tooth-brushing to our evening routine. We went through
   hundreds and hundreds of picture and chapter books. As Gabe learned to
   read, I initially rejoiced in my moments of freedom while he read
   alone. But when he stopped choosing reading as an activity to do on his
   own, I realized that, in addition to giving us precious family bonding
   time, reading together had actually increased his personal enthusiasm
   for books. Starting a book together was often the hook he needed to get
   sufficiently interested in the characters and the plot to then read the
   rest of the story on his own.

   Mistake #4: Valuing tidiness over access to books.
   I hate clutter. A couple of years ago, in an attempt to clean up, I
   moved every ‚Äúkid book‚Äù in the house to one bookshelf in my children‚Äôs
   bedroom. The living room and the dining room were neater, but I found
   this actually reduced my kids‚Äô reading. The ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moment came when I
   was running a used book drive for our school. We had several messy,
   overflowing boxes of books in our living room. My son would plop down
   on the couch, peer into the box, pull something out ‚Ä¶ and start
   reading!

   We know that access to books is crucial for children‚Äôs development, and
   getting books to lower-income families who can‚Äôt afford them and to
   rural kids who live far from libraries should be a major public
   priority. But we can also make ‚Äúaccess‚Äù to books a priority within our
   own homes ‚Äî and this was a form of access I could influence. Needless
   to say, reading material is no longer limited to one room, but instead
   lives in every corner of our house so that my kids can find it and
   peruse it whenever (and wherever!) the mood strikes.

John Green launches Crash Course: Navigating Digital Information

   Posted on January 21, 2019 by ELA teacher

   ANUARY 17, 2019 BY JOYCE VALENZA L
   On behalf of my library/educator colleagues, thank you, John Green.

   Thank you, John, for offering us a new tool in introducing media
   literacy and credibility awareness with our learning communities. Thank
   you for lending your honest voice and passion to this mission.

   John recently introduced a new 10-episode Crash Course series,
   Navigating Digital Information, developed in partnership with
   MediaWise‚Äìa project of the Poynter Institute, funded by Google, with
   curriculum developed by the Stanford History Education Group who gave
   us several important research projects, including the well-known study,
   Evaluating Information: The Cornerstone of Civic Online Reasoning, with
   its bleak wake-up call.

   In the introduction, John discusses the importance of how the quality
   of the information we meet online shapes our understanding of the
   universe and our place in that universe.

   as we allow ourselves to fall into the vast endlessness of passive
   scrolling, we allow the information we ingest, and the algorithms
   feeding us that information, to shape who we are as people‚Äìto shape how
   we think, what we value, whom we trust, and what we do. Much attention
   has rightly been paid to the ways that misinformation and
   disinformation are shaping our political and social discourse, but they
   are also shaping us‚Äìas individuals and as communities. Getting better
   at evaluating information means becoming a better citizen of the
   communities where you live; it also means become a better informed and
   more engaged person.

   In the second episode, The Facts about Fact Checking: Crash Course
   Navigating Digital Information, John Green takes us to fact-checking
   school, sharing the importance of interrogating the information we
   discover online, encouraging us to work out our information analyzing
   muscles because,

   better information leads to better decision-making, which leads to a
   better world.

   He suggests three questions:

   Screen Shot 2019-01-17 at 9.35.24 AMWho is behind the information?
   Why are they sharing the information?
   What types of claims are being made? Are those claims backed up by
   reliable evidence and what do others say about the claims?
   Using a Thought Bubble example of a tweet advocating for steel straws,
   John demonstrates the need to have discussions with real data, to
   engage in cost-benefit analysis, and he shares the importance of
   understanding the fine line between being skepticism and cynicism. John
   also explores echo chambers and filter bubbles. Using a personal,
   real-life hypothetical sports example about a horrible football club,
   he shows how your inner skeptic might speak up mostly when you see
   information that seems like it must be wrong to you because it does not
   align with your pre-existing worldview.

   Here‚Äôs the plan for the full 10-episode series:Screen Shot 2019-01-17

DIY Book Trading Cards

   Posted on January 13, 2019 by ELA teacher

   DIY Book Trading Cards
   JANUARY 9, 2019 BY KAREN JENSEN, TLT LEAVE A COMMENT
   tradingcard

   My family traveled over the holidays and at one point, we saw a TSA
   agent with a K9 dog. Thing 2 pointed and said, ‚Äúlook, there‚Äôs a dog,‚Äù
   which prompted the TS-9 to hand her a trading card made about the dog,
   whose name was Hilbert. It was a genius marketing strategy to make kids
   comfortable and satisfy their curiosity while maintaining their
   distance and prevent them from approaching or petting the working dogs.

   tradingcards7 tradingcards8I kept thinking about this K9 trading card
   and all the fun marketing potential it has. So the other day I tweeted
   and said, what if we made book trading cards? I liked the idea so much
   that I then started obsessively figuring out ways to make trading cards
   and exploring the best tools, as I have a tendency to do. Here‚Äôs a look
   at 5 tools I used, the trading cards I created using them, and then at
   the end of this post I have a few ideas for ways that we can use the
   idea of trading cards to promote reading, programs and libraries in
   school and public libraries.

   Instax Mini Trading Cards

   tradingcards6

   As regular readers know, I am recently obsessed with the Instax Mini
   camera. I like the wide variety of things you can do with it AND the
   fact that you get an instant picture. Patience is not a virtue I have
   and I don‚Äôt have a lot of art or tech skills. You can buy a variety of
   Instax Mini sticker frames, which have a piece that goes on the back of
   your photo, which helps make this project work. This back sticker makes
   it so that you can use both sides of the photograph to make quick and
   easy trading cards. Use a Sharpie marker (I found the Extra Fine tip
   worked the best) to write on the front and back of your instant photo.
   You can also use metallic silver Sharpies to write directly on the
   black back if you don‚Äôt have sticker frames. I wrote various facts and
   gave a rating for my book in the margins of the photo. Here I did an
   example using the upcoming book Dig by A. S. King.

   tradingcards3

   The benefit to this method is that it is seriously quick and easy. The
   drawback, of course, is that you have to have a couple of Instax Mini
   cameras on hand, which I recommend. (Did I mention I am a huge fan?)
   Film is not, however, cheap and I haven‚Äôt found it for less than around
   $0.68 a picture. So though it may be quick, easy and kind of low tech,
   it‚Äôs not in-expensive. The Instax Mini is a fun device, with immediate
   results and most tweens and teens I know are currently really
   interested in this device. This is a good starting place if you want
   easy and immediate results.

   Sports Card Pro App

   tradingcards2

   The trading card that you see in the upper right hand card was made
   using the Sports Card Pro app, which I downloaded for free. It has in
   app purchases, but the initial app download is free. I made no
   additional purchases to create my trading card so the entire product
   was free to me.

   Where you see the rocket ship in the left hand corner the Sports Card
   Pro app gives you a choice of various sports balls to put in that
   corner. This didn‚Äôt really work for me so I saved my picture and opened
   it in another app, Candy Camera, to add the rocket ship. But if you
   want a sports theme, you can do it all in this app and pretty quickly.
   I made the example you see in this picture in about 2 minutes while
   laying in bed with the TV on in the background and no real experience
   with the app. I tell you this because I want you to understand how
   quick and easy it was.

   One of the things I liked about this app is how much focus it put on
   the picture, but that left less room for text. It has rigidly set text
   boxes and design elements, so it doesn‚Äôt allow for a lot of
   personalization or moving elements around. Some people would like this,
   but I found it frustrating as I wanted to move certain elements
   slightly in one direction or another and it just doesn‚Äôt give you that
   freedom of design. You could get around this problem by doing the most
   basic design in this app, saving your card and then uploading it into
   another app ‚Äì like Over or PS Express ‚Äì to add more design elements,
   but that‚Äôs a lot of additional steps and requires some additional
   knowledge.

   Because this is a mobile device app, you have to be able to print
   wirelessly to some type of device. Because I knew I wanted a small,
   trading card size, I used the Print to Size app on my cell phone which
   allows you better control over sizing as opposed to simply printing
   from a mobile device to a wireless printer. I printed to both a regular
   printer and a Selphy photo printer, which I discuss more at the end of
   this post.

   So while this is a good app for designing a sports themed card, it‚Äôs
   not necessarily good for other themes. It was quick and easy, but not
   very versatile.

   Trading Card Creator at ReadThinkWrite

   tradingcards5 tradingcards4

   This is a free online program that has an educational focus, so it has
   a lot more room for text. You can include facts about the book, main
   characters, setting, etc. After you go through the generator ‚Äì which is
   an easy to fill out step by step form ‚Äì you download your card as a
   .pdf and it prints on a piece of letter size paper. Adobe is required
   to run the program.

   When you print out your page it comes with instructions that tell you
   to cut it out, fold it, and tape it closed. It prints in color, but I
   accidentally printed mine in black and white. If you choose the ‚ÄúMake
   Your Own‚Äù option it allows you to put in your own category headings.
   Otherwise, the big section headings are pre-programmed, which can be a
   great feature for younger or newer users. However, it does not seem to
   allow you to move the various elements or text boxes around, so format
   wise there isn‚Äôt a lot of versatility here either. This is a quick and
   easy tool, but if you want more personalization or versatility, this
   isn‚Äôt the best tool for you. It‚Äôs a really great starting place and
   will work really well in most school or library settings.

   Freehand Design Tools: Microsoft Publisher, Google Draw and Canva

   tradingcards1

   I used the format presented in the ReadWriteThink card and a sports
   trading card I had at home for inspiration to try my final option:
   Microsoft Publisher, Canva and Google Draw. Each of these programs are
   publishing programs that allow you the greatest amount of freedom and
   versatility in how you design and where you place your various trading
   card elements. You can see the results in the bottom left hand corner
   of the picture above. Both Canva and Google Draw are basically no or
   low cost programs that allow you to do freehand design. Microsoft
   Publisher requires the purchase of a yearly license and it is costly.
   All three design programs require a certain amount of skill, which most
   people get just by tinkering around in the programs. I am least well
   versed in Google Draw and abandoned that medium pretty quickly for
   something more familiar. I use Publisher and Canva pretty frequently so
   I was able to produce something I liked pretty quickly and without a
   lot of difficulty. The final product you see in the picture above was
   made using Publisher, which I am most comfortable with and, I feel,
   gives you the most freedom. The Teen and many of the teens I work with,
   however, are much more familiar with Google Draw and would probably
   prefer it.

   After completing my card design I grouped all my design elements, right
   clicked on my trading card, saved it as a .jpeg and printed it to size.
   I was able to print 6 cards per one letter size sheet of card stock
   paper. Saving it as a .jpeg also allows you to upload it and share it
   on social media or easily transfer it from one device to another, like
   from my laptop to my cell phone. There are some real advantages to
   having a .jpeg file versus a .pdf file.

   Printing My Trading Cards

   All of the options allow you to save and print your trading card in one
   fashion or another. If you use a freehand graphics program you can save
   as a .jpg and print on card stock. You‚Äôll want to use card stock to
   give it the heft of a trading card. If you have the option, I would
   print to photo paper to give it that glossy trading card look. Although
   I liked the look of the curved edges for the trading card design, it
   requires some additional cutting which was harder to make look nice
   with my questionable scissor skills. I liked the straight lines because
   I could use a paper cutter and get nice, straight edges. Your mileage
   may vary.

   selphy4

   If printing from a handheld device I would recommend using the Print to
   Size app and printing 2 trading cards side by side on one postcard
   using the Selphy printer and cutting them apart. This was the method of
   printing I used in the very first picture of this post. Printing with a
   Selphy printer or onto photo paper using a traditional printer gives
   you that glossy trading card resembling finish. If you‚Äôre not familiar
   with the Selphy photo printer, it‚Äôs a tool I highly recommend for
   anyone wanting to print photos from a mobile device. It‚Äôs small,
   portable and has its own built in wi-fi so you can take it with you on
   outreach events and print immediately from a smart phone or tablet. I
   reviewed the Selphy printer here if you would like more information.

   Things to Include on a Book Trading Card

   Title
   Author
   Setting
   A catchphrase or brief descriptive phrase
   Fun facts like characters, themes
   If you like X, read this statements . . .
   A star rating
   What to Do with Book Trading Cards?

   At it‚Äôs most basic, libraries could make book trading cards for our
   favorite or most recent YA titles and hand them out during book talks
   or at outreach events. Imagine book talking a book then handing each
   tween or teen a card with a picture of the book cover and a few basic
   facts about the book so they could remember to ask for it. Wouldn‚Äôt it
   be great to have teens come into the library after a day of booktalking
   and just hand staff a book trading card instead of trying to remember
   details about the book you booktalked that they want and hoping that
   staff can get enough details to get the right book into their hands?

   This would also be a great marketing tool for the library itself or for
   specific programs. For example, during National Library Week
   multi-branch systems could make cards for each branch with basic facts
   about the branch and hand them out to visitors. Libraries could host
   some type of challenge inviting patrons to visit as many branches as
   possible during National Library Week and offering an entry into a
   prize for patrons who get one card from X number of branches.

   Beyond using book trading cards as a promotional tool, we could also
   get tools into the hands of tweens and teens and encourage them to make
   their own. This activity combines reading/literacy with making, helping
   us achieve more of our goals. Have a program day where you provide a
   couple of Instax Mini cameras and some Sharpies and challenge teens to
   make their own trading cards. Or set up an ongoing station in the
   corner of your library and make a trading card wall to display teen
   created book trading cards. Teens could stop in during lunch, study
   hall or after school and make a quick book trading card and put it on
   your wall recommending books to their peers.

   Learning how to use a good graphics program is a valuable skill for
   anyone, so don‚Äôt be afraid to have some in-depth sessions where you
   teach teens how to use Publisher, Canva or Google Draw and challenge
   them to design their own book trading cards. Many schools and libraries
   have tech training labs and this would be a fun project to teach design
   basics with some set parameters. I have found that many people want
   some concrete guidelines and examples to begin learning design with and
   here we would have a built in template to help guide us.

   And don‚Äôt forget that if you want an easy to use template, you can have
   tweens and teens use the ReadWriteThink trading card creator. Print two
   of each card, one for participants to take home and one to display on
   an RA wall or book display. Or print 3 ‚Äì so they can trade!

   Some Final Thoughts and Perspectives

   Depending on what you need, there are pros and cons to each of the
   various methods used above. Most school and public libraries are
   already set up to use something like the ReadWriteThink trading card
   creator and print. This is probably a really good starting point.

   I highly recommend purchasing a smart phone/tablet and Selphy printer
   for any teen library space that wants to do a lot of photo based making
   and programming, but it does require some initial financial investment
   and the ongoing cost of the specific Selphy paper. You would need
   multiple devices to have a program, though you can connect multiple
   devices to one Selphy printer. Or you can set up a small maker station
   using one device and one printer and allow teens to create as they
   wanted. Not every teen area or school library has the space or the
   staff, but if you do a small maker station is a good idea.

   And in my ideal world, I would write a grant to get 5 to 10 Instax Mini
   cameras for a teen space or program to do a wide variety of programming
   things there. You could also just have one and have teens share or set
   up a maker station using this method as well.

   Don‚Äôt forget to create a hashtag so you can encourage tweens and teens
   to share their book trading cards online.

   I made a wide variety of trading cards using all 5 methods over a
   two-day period. I spent all in all about 3 hours making trading cards.
   Again, I am a pretty proficient user of both Publisher and Canva so I
   didn‚Äôt have to learn the basics. Each method has its pros and cons and
   really all of them work pretty well. I liked the Sports Card Pro app
   the least, mainly because I was not making a sports themed trading card
   and it required some work around to get rid of the sports themes. As
   you can see, for my examples I used Thing 2‚Äôs Operation BB as a theme
   for my example cards, mainly because I had those photos readily
   available on my phone. We did, in fact, print out several of the cards
   we liked best ‚Äì the one made in Publisher ‚Äì and handed them out as a
   promotional tool and people thought they were very cool. I also
   uploaded it to the Operation BB social media page. These will, in fact,
   work really well as fun promotional tools. I had a lot of fun making
   the trading cards and highly recommend it.

   So now it‚Äôs your turn. Make a trading card for your favorite book or
   book character and sharing it with us in the comments or on social
   media using the hasthag #BookTradingCard. I would love to see what
   everyone is creating (and reading!)
