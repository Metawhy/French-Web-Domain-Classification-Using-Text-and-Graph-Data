What is BookCrossing?

     * if you love your books, let them go- The New York Times
     * an unlikely global sociology experiment- Book Magazine
     * a modern-day message in a bottle- San Francisco Chronicle

   BookCrossing is the act of releasing your books "into the wild" for a
   stranger to find, or via "controlled release" to another BookCrossing
   member, and tracking where they go via journal entries from around the
   world. Our community of 1,957,112 passionate, generous book-lovers is
   changing the world and touching lives, one traveling book at a time. We
   hope you join us!

Pardon Our English, we're translating as fast as we can.

   There are currently over 20 languages that are being translated and
   will be ready for the site very soon! We will make announcements as
   each becomes ready.

   Current language setting: en-US

   You are currently viewing BookCrossing.com in English.

   You are viewing BookCrossing.com in English because
     * your browser's language preference is set to English
          or
     * you have selected English as preferred language in your profile
          or
     * you have overriden any previous setting by selecting a language
       from this page.

   If you wish to view BookCrossing.com in another of the supported
   languages listed below you can either:
     * Select that language in your profile. That would be a permanent
       selection (until you change it again, that is) but of course would
       be only effective while you are logged in.
          or
     * Change it with the form below. This will override any other
       language setting but when you close your browser it will be removed
       and reverted to standard (it's stored in a “session cookie”).

   Note: Some languages which are not fully translated yet you may be able
   to select only on this page but not in your profile settings.
