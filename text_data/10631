   Because of an unexpected error in Google's spreadsheet access service
   on 29 April 2019, many timelines stopped working. At this time, we
   believe the issues have been resolved.

   TimelineJS is an open-source tool that enables anyone to build visually
   rich, interactive timelines. Beginners can create a timeline using
   nothing more than a Google spreadsheet, like the one we used for the
   Timeline above. Experts can use their JSON skills to create custom
   installations, while keeping TimelineJS's core functionality.

   Knight Lab Watch this brief video for an overview of how to make a
   timeline.

Tips & tricks

    1. Keep it short. We recommend not having more than 20 slides for a
       reader to click through.
    2. Pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative. It does
       not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.
    3. Write each event as a part of a larger narrative.
    4. Include events that build up to major occurrences — not just the
       major events.

Media sources

   TimelineJS can pull in media from a variety of sources. Twitter,
   Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Dailymotion, Google Maps, Wikipedia,
   SoundCloud, Document Cloud and more!

Make a Timeline

   TimelineJS works on any site or blog. Make your own in four easy steps.
   Having trouble? Watch our video, or see the help section below.
    1.

Create your spreadsheet
       Build a new Google Spreadsheet using our template. You'll need to
       copy the template to your own Google Drive account by clicking the
       "Make a Copy" button.
       Drop dates, text and links to media into the appropriate columns.
       For more about working with our template, see our help docs.
       Get the Spreadsheet Template
       Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and
       don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
    2.

Publish to the web
       Under the File menu, select “Publish to the Web.”
       [publish_to_web_small.png]
       In the next window, click the blue "publish" button. When asked,
       "Are you sure…?" click OK.
       Now, copy the URL that appears in the center of the window. You'll
       use this in the next step.
       [publish_to_web_button_small.png] [publish_to_web_url_small.png]
       The following has changed as of 18 July 2017!
       Close the 'Publish to the web' window. Copy the URL for your
       Timeline from the browser's address bar. It should look something
       like this:
       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xuY4upIooEeszZ_lCmeNx24eSFW
       e0rHe9ZdqH2xqVNk/edit#gid=0
       Disregard the URL that appears in the "publish to the web" window.
       It used to be used below, but changes to Google mean that you'll
       get an error if you use it now.
    3.

Generate your timeline
       Copy/paste spreadsheet URL into the box below to generate your
       timeline. (Make sure you've published the spreadsheet.)
       Google Spreadsheet URL ____________________
       Width 100%________________

Map Type
       Currently all Google's base maps are supported. When creating a
       Google map, style it the way you would like it to appear, and then
       paste the resulting link into your Google Spreadsheet.

Default start slide
       Slide 0___________________
       You can tell TimelineJS to start at a specific slide number.

Initial zoom level
       Zoom Level 2___________________
       The zoom level at which the timeline portion of TimelineJS will
       display on load. Specify a value from 0-10 (default is 2). Smaller
       numbers show a greater span of time.

Misc
       [ ] Start at the end
       Begins the timeline on the last slide.
       [ ] Show nav on top
       Switches the vertical order of the timeline navigation and the
       media.
       [ ] Debug
       In debug mode, the JavaScript console will display logging
       messages.
       [ ] Use hash bookmarks
       Assigns a hash bookmark to each slide's URL, allowing deep linking
       to slides. (For directly linked Timelines only -- does not work for
       iframe embeds)

    4.

Share your timeline

Share Link
       Use this to link directly to your timeline.
       If you're embedding on Medium.com or other oembed-aware services,
       just paste this link on a line by itself where you want your
       timeline to appear.

Frequently asked questions

     * [X]
    How do I edit my timeline?
       Once you've created a timeline, you can make changes by going back
       to your Google spreadsheet. Changes you make to the spreadsheet are
       automatically available to your Timeline—you don't need to repeat
       the 'publish to the web' step (step #2). If you want to make
       changes to the optional settings, you will need to update your
       embed code, but if you are only changing content in the
       spreadsheet, then there's nothing else to do.
     * [X]
    What web browsers does TimelineJS work with?
       Our primary development and testing browser is Google Chrome. We
       adhere closely to web standards, so we believe that TimelineJS
       should work effectively in all modern web browsers. TimelineJS is
       known to not work with Internet Explorer versions before IE10.
     * [X]
    What are my options for changing how my Timeline looks?
       First, make sure you know everything you can do in the spreadsheet
       configuration, like background colors and images. Also, check out
       the optional settings part of 'step 3' of the authoring tool. You
       can change the fonts, the position of the timeline navigation, and
       the initial zoom level. If you still want to do more, there are
       some configuration options available. Most of those are for fine
       tuning, but some of them may be helpful.
     * [X]
    There aren't enough options. I want more control over the [font
       size/color/etc]. Can I change things using CSS?
       Because there are so many details to the styling, this is not
       exactly simple, but, if you have some technical capacity, you can
       override TimelineJS's CSS rules and have complete control over the
       look of the timeline. For details, see Using the TimelineJS CSS
       selectors. You will need to be able to instantiate the Timeline in
       javascript on your own page. (There is no way to override the CSS
       using the iframe embed.) Then, either in <style> tags in that page,
       or in an external stylesheet, you can specify CSS rules changing
       some or all of TimelineJS's default presentation. The basis of
       TimelineJS's styles are in these files, which use the Less CSS
       preprocessor.
     * [X]
    How can I categorize or group my events?
       Every event in a timeline can have a group property. Events with
       the same group are shown in the same row or adjacent rows, and the
       common value of their group property is used as a label at the left
       edge of the timeline. Groups can be set using the 'group' column in
       the Google Spreadsheet or the 'group' property of a JSON slide
       object. TimelineJS does not support any other special styling for
       events in the same group.
     * [X]
    The first slide in my timeline isn't the first chronologically. Why
       did this happen?
       When using the Google Spreadsheet to configure your timeline, if
       you put the word title in the type column, that slide will be put
       at the front, regardless of the values in the date columns. See the
       Google Spreadsheet documentation for more information.
     * [X]
    Can I make media images clickable?
       No. Many of TimelineJS's media types are interactive, and so would
       not be able to handle a link, and other of TimelineJS's media types
       have terms of service which require a link back to the source of
       the media. As an alternative, consider using HTML to add links in
       the caption, credit, or text for the slide.
     * [X]
    How can I format text (add line breaks, bold, italics)?
       TimelineJS's text fields (headline, text, caption, and credit) all
       accept HTML markup. A full tutorial on HTML is outside the scope of
       this FAQ, but here are a few basics:
          + Wrap paragraphs in <p></p> tags to create line breaks.
          + Wrap text in <b></b> tags for bold text and <i></i> for
            italics
     * [X]
    How do I enter BCE dates?
       To enter dates before the common era, just use a negative value for
       the year. Of course, you can also enter month and date if you need
       them.
     * [X]
    How do I create very ancient dates?
       Generally, you don't have to think about it -- just enter the dates
       you want. Timeline can handle dates literally to the beginning of
       time. For dates more than about 250,000 years ago, only the year is
       usable. Support for those older dates is still relatively new, so
       if anything seems off, visit our tech support site.
     * [X]
    Who can access the data in my Google spreadsheet?
       You must make the data public to the web to use TimelineJS with a
       Google Spreadsheet as the data source. Normally, the data is still
       only visible to people who know the link, so if you publish a
       timeline privately, outsiders are unlikely to see the data.
       However, it is still public, so you must decide if that is
       acceptable.
     * [X]
    Privacy is very important to me. How should I use TimelineJS?
       If you want complete control over who can see the information in
       your timeline, you cannot use Google Spreadsheets, and you cannot
       use our standard iframe embed code. Instead, you must use JSON
       format for the data and instantiate the timeline directly using
       javascript. You can then use standard web server security measures
       to control who has access to your timeline and the data used to
       create it.
     * [X]
    Will my spreadsheet get picked up by search engines?
       Under normal circumstances, Google tells search engines not to
       index spreadsheets which are published to the web. Of course, if
       the page is public on the web, it is possible that a search engine
       will disregard those instructions.
     * [X]
    Can I use TimelineJS with Wordpress?
       It depends. TimelineJS does not work with Wordpress.com sites. We
       are researching ways to address this.
       If you are able to install plugins to your Wordpress installation,
       we have a Wordpress plugin for Timeline. It supports embedding
       Timelines with Wordpress "shortcode", and as of version 3.3.14.0,
       it also has experimental "oembed" support. That means that you can
       take a direct URL to a timeline (like you get with the "get link to
       preview" button) and put it in a post on a line by itself, and it
       should be embedded. (Make sure you've updated the plugin before you
       try it.)
     * [X]
    Is TimelineJS free for commercial use?
       TimelineJS is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL),
       version 2.0. That means that TimelineJS is free to "use, reproduce,
       make available, modify, display, perform, distribute" or otherwise
       employ. You don't need our permission to publish stories with
       TimelineJS and you don't need to pay us any fees or arrange any
       further license beyond the MPL. To read more about what you can do
       with TimelineJS, read our license page.

Frequently asked questions

     * [X]
    How do I edit my timeline?
       Once you've created a timeline, you can make changes by going back
       to your Google spreadsheet. Changes you make to the spreadsheet are
       automatically available to your Timeline—you don't need to repeat
       the 'publish to the web' step (step #2). If you want to make
       changes to the optional settings, you will need to update your
       embed code, but if you are only changing content in the
       spreadsheet, then there's nothing else to do.
     * [X]
    What web browsers does TimelineJS work with?
       Our primary development and testing browser is Google Chrome. We
       adhere closely to web standards, so we believe that TimelineJS
       should work effectively in all modern web browsers. TimelineJS is
       known to not work with Internet Explorer versions before IE10.
     * [X]
    What are my options for changing how my Timeline looks?
       First, make sure you know everything you can do in the spreadsheet
       configuration, like background colors and images. Also, check out
       the optional settings part of 'step 3' of the authoring tool. You
       can change the fonts, the position of the timeline navigation, and
       the initial zoom level. If you still want to do more, there are
       some configuration options available. Most of those are for fine
       tuning, but some of them may be helpful.
     * [X]
    There aren't enough options. I want more control over the [font
       size/color/etc]. Can I change things using CSS?
       Because there are so many details to the styling, this is not
       exactly simple, but, if you have some technical capacity, you can
       override TimelineJS's CSS rules and have complete control over the
       look of the timeline. For details, see Using the TimelineJS CSS
       selectors. You will need to be able to instantiate the Timeline in
       javascript on your own page. (There is no way to override the CSS
       using the iframe embed.) Then, either in <style> tags in that page,
       or in an external stylesheet, you can specify CSS rules changing
       some or all of TimelineJS's default presentation. The basis of
       TimelineJS's styles are in these files, which use the Less CSS
       preprocessor.
     * [X]
    How can I categorize or group my events?
       Every event in a timeline can have a group property. Events with
       the same group are shown in the same row or adjacent rows, and the
       common value of their group property is used as a label at the left
       edge of the timeline. Groups can be set using the 'group' column in
       the Google Spreadsheet or the 'group' property of a JSON slide
       object. TimelineJS does not support any other special styling for
       events in the same group.
     * [X]
    The first slide in my timeline isn't the first chronologically. Why
       did this happen?
       When using the Google Spreadsheet to configure your timeline, if
       you put the word title in the type column, that slide will be put
       at the front, regardless of the values in the date columns. See the
       Google Spreadsheet documentation for more information.
     * [X]
    Can I make media images clickable?
       No. Many of TimelineJS's media types are interactive, and so would
       not be able to handle a link, and other of TimelineJS's media types
       have terms of service which require a link back to the source of
       the media. As an alternative, consider using HTML to add links in
       the caption, credit, or text for the slide.
     * [X]
    How can I format text (add line breaks, bold, italics)?
       TimelineJS's text fields (headline, text, caption, and credit) all
       accept HTML markup. A full tutorial on HTML is outside the scope of
       this FAQ, but here are a few basics:
          + Wrap paragraphs in <p></p> tags to create line breaks.
          + Wrap text in <b></b> tags for bold text and <i></i> for
            italics
     * [X]
    How do I enter BCE dates?
       To enter dates before the common era, just use a negative value for
       the year. Of course, you can also enter month and date if you need
       them.
     * [X]
    How do I create very ancient dates?
       Generally, you don't have to think about it -- just enter the dates
       you want. Timeline can handle dates literally to the beginning of
       time. For dates more than about 250,000 years ago, only the year is
       usable. Support for those older dates is still relatively new, so
       if anything seems off, visit our tech support site.
     * [X]
    Who can access the data in my Google spreadsheet?
       You must make the data public to the web to use TimelineJS with a
       Google Spreadsheet as the data source. Normally, the data is still
       only visible to people who know the link, so if you publish a
       timeline privately, outsiders are unlikely to see the data.
       However, it is still public, so you must decide if that is
       acceptable.
     * [X]
    Privacy is very important to me. How should I use TimelineJS?
       If you want complete control over who can see the information in
       your timeline, you cannot use Google Spreadsheets, and you cannot
       use our standard iframe embed code. Instead, you must use JSON
       format for the data and instantiate the timeline directly using
       javascript. You can then use standard web server security measures
       to control who has access to your timeline and the data used to
       create it.
     * [X]
    Will my spreadsheet get picked up by search engines?
       Under normal circumstances, Google tells search engines not to
       index spreadsheets which are published to the web. Of course, if
       the page is public on the web, it is possible that a search engine
       will disregard those instructions.
     * [X]
    Can I use TimelineJS with Wordpress?
       It depends. TimelineJS does not work with Wordpress.com sites. We
       are researching ways to address this.
       If you are able to install plugins to your Wordpress installation,
       we have a Wordpress plugin for Timeline. It supports embedding
       Timelines with Wordpress "shortcode", and as of version 3.3.14.0,
       it also has experimental "oembed" support. That means that you can
       take a direct URL to a timeline (like you get with the "get link to
       preview" button) and put it in a post on a line by itself, and it
       should be embedded. (Make sure you've updated the plugin before you
       try it.)
     * [X]
    Is TimelineJS free for commercial use?
       TimelineJS is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL),
       version 2.0. That means that TimelineJS is free to "use, reproduce,
       make available, modify, display, perform, distribute" or otherwise
       employ. You don't need our permission to publish stories with
       TimelineJS and you don't need to pay us any fees or arrange any
       further license beyond the MPL. To read more about what you can do

   Because of an unexpected error in Google's spreadsheet access service
   on 29 April 2019, many timelines stopped working. At this time, we
   believe the issues have been resolved.

   IFRAME:
   https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source

   TimelineJS is an open-source tool that enables anyone to build visually
   rich, interactive timelines. Beginners can create a timeline using
   nothing more than a Google spreadsheet, like the one we used for the
   Timeline above. Experts can use their JSON skills to create custom
   installations, while keeping TimelineJS's core functionality.

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/143407878

   Knight Lab Watch this brief video for an overview of how to make a
   timeline.

Tips & tricks

    1. Keep it short. We recommend not having more than 20 slides for a
       reader to click through.
    2. Pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative. It does
       not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.
    3. Write each event as a part of a larger narrative.
    4. Include events that build up to major occurrences — not just the
       major events.

Media sources

   TimelineJS can pull in media from a variety of sources. Twitter,
   Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Dailymotion, Google Maps, Wikipedia,
   SoundCloud, Document Cloud and more!

Make a Timeline

   TimelineJS works on any site or blog. Make your own in four easy steps.
   Having trouble? Watch our video, or see the help section below.
    1.

Create your spreadsheet
       Build a new Google Spreadsheet using our template. You'll need to
       copy the template to your own Google Drive account by clicking the
       "Make a Copy" button.
       Drop dates, text and links to media into the appropriate columns.
       For more about working with our template, see our help docs.
       Get the Spreadsheet Template
       Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and
       don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
    2.

Publish to the web
       Under the File menu, select “Publish to the Web.”
       [publish_to_web_small.png]
       In the next window, click the blue "publish" button. When asked,
       "Are you sure…?" click OK.
       Now, copy the URL that appears in the center of the window. You'll
       use this in the next step.
       [publish_to_web_button_small.png] [publish_to_web_url_small.png]
       The following has changed as of 18 July 2017!
       Close the 'Publish to the web' window. Copy the URL for your
       Timeline from the browser's address bar. It should look something
       like this:
       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xuY4upIooEeszZ_lCmeNx24eSFW
       e0rHe9ZdqH2xqVNk/edit#gid=0
       Disregard the URL that appears in the "publish to the web" window.
       It used to be used below, but changes to Google mean that you'll
       get an error if you use it now.
    3.

Generate your timeline
       Copy/paste spreadsheet URL into the box below to generate your
       timeline. (Make sure you've published the spreadsheet.)
       Google Spreadsheet URL ____________________

       usable. Support for those older dates is still relatively new, so
       if anything seems off, visit our tech support site.
     * [X]
    Who can access the data in my Google spreadsheet?
       You must make the data public to the web to use TimelineJS with a
       Google Spreadsheet as the data source. Normally, the data is still
       only visible to people who know the link, so if you publish a
       timeline privately, outsiders are unlikely to see the data.
       However, it is still public, so you must decide if that is
       acceptable.
     * [X]
    Privacy is very important to me. How should I use TimelineJS?
       If you want complete control over who can see the information in
       your timeline, you cannot use Google Spreadsheets, and you cannot
       use our standard iframe embed code. Instead, you must use JSON
       format for the data and instantiate the timeline directly using
       javascript. You can then use standard web server security measures
       to control who has access to your timeline and the data used to
       create it.
     * [X]
    Will my spreadsheet get picked up by search engines?
       Under normal circumstances, Google tells search engines not to
       index spreadsheets which are published to the web. Of course, if
       the page is public on the web, it is possible that a search engine
       will disregard those instructions.
     * [X]
    Can I use TimelineJS with Wordpress?
       It depends. TimelineJS does not work with Wordpress.com sites. We
       are researching ways to address this.
       If you are able to install plugins to your Wordpress installation,
       we have a Wordpress plugin for Timeline. It supports embedding
       Timelines with Wordpress "shortcode", and as of version 3.3.14.0,
       it also has experimental "oembed" support. That means that you can
       take a direct URL to a timeline (like you get with the "get link to
       preview" button) and put it in a post on a line by itself, and it
       should be embedded. (Make sure you've updated the plugin before you
       try it.)
     * [X]
    Is TimelineJS free for commercial use?
       TimelineJS is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL),
       version 2.0. That means that TimelineJS is free to "use, reproduce,
       make available, modify, display, perform, distribute" or otherwise
       employ. You don't need our permission to publish stories with
       TimelineJS and you don't need to pay us any fees or arrange any

     * Help

   Because of an unexpected error in Google's spreadsheet access service
   on 29 April 2019, many timelines stopped working. At this time, we
   believe the issues have been resolved.

   IFRAME:
   https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source

   TimelineJS is an open-source tool that enables anyone to build visually
   rich, interactive timelines. Beginners can create a timeline using
   nothing more than a Google spreadsheet, like the one we used for the
   Timeline above. Experts can use their JSON skills to create custom
   installations, while keeping TimelineJS's core functionality.

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/143407878

   Knight Lab Watch this brief video for an overview of how to make a
   timeline.

Tips & tricks

    1. Keep it short. We recommend not having more than 20 slides for a
       reader to click through.
    2. Pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative. It does
       not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.
    3. Write each event as a part of a larger narrative.
    4. Include events that build up to major occurrences — not just the
       major events.

Media sources

   TimelineJS can pull in media from a variety of sources. Twitter,
   Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Dailymotion, Google Maps, Wikipedia,
   SoundCloud, Document Cloud and more!

Make a Timeline

   TimelineJS works on any site or blog. Make your own in four easy steps.
   Having trouble? Watch our video, or see the help section below.
    1.

Create your spreadsheet
       Build a new Google Spreadsheet using our template. You'll need to
       copy the template to your own Google Drive account by clicking the
       "Make a Copy" button.
       Drop dates, text and links to media into the appropriate columns.
       For more about working with our template, see our help docs.
       Get the Spreadsheet Template
       Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and
       don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
    2.

Publish to the web
       Under the File menu, select “Publish to the Web.”
       [publish_to_web_small.png]
       In the next window, click the blue "publish" button. When asked,
       "Are you sure…?" click OK.
       Now, copy the URL that appears in the center of the window. You'll
       use this in the next step.
       [publish_to_web_button_small.png] [publish_to_web_url_small.png]
       The following has changed as of 18 July 2017!
       Close the 'Publish to the web' window. Copy the URL for your
       Timeline from the browser's address bar. It should look something
       like this:
       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xuY4upIooEeszZ_lCmeNx24eSFW
       e0rHe9ZdqH2xqVNk/edit#gid=0
       Disregard the URL that appears in the "publish to the web" window.
       It used to be used below, but changes to Google mean that you'll
       get an error if you use it now.
    3.

Generate your timeline
       Copy/paste spreadsheet URL into the box below to generate your
       timeline. (Make sure you've published the spreadsheet.)
       Google Spreadsheet URL ____________________
       Width 100%________________
       Height 650_________________

Map Type
       Currently all Google's base maps are supported. When creating a
       Google map, style it the way you would like it to appear, and then
       paste the resulting link into your Google Spreadsheet.

Default start slide
       Slide 0___________________
       You can tell TimelineJS to start at a specific slide number.

Initial zoom level
       Zoom Level 2___________________
       The zoom level at which the timeline portion of TimelineJS will
       display on load. Specify a value from 0-10 (default is 2). Smaller
       numbers show a greater span of time.

Misc
       [ ] Start at the end
       Begins the timeline on the last slide.
       [ ] Show nav on top
       Switches the vertical order of the timeline navigation and the
       media.
       [ ] Debug
       In debug mode, the JavaScript console will display logging
       messages.
       [ ] Use hash bookmarks
       Assigns a hash bookmark to each slide's URL, allowing deep linking
       to slides. (For directly linked Timelines only -- does not work for
       iframe embeds)

    4.

Share your timeline

Share Link
       Use this to link directly to your timeline.
       If you're embedding on Medium.com or other oembed-aware services,

Frequently asked questions

     * [X]
    How do I edit my timeline?
       Once you've created a timeline, you can make changes by going back
       to your Google spreadsheet. Changes you make to the spreadsheet are
       automatically available to your Timeline—you don't need to repeat
       the 'publish to the web' step (step #2). If you want to make
       changes to the optional settings, you will need to update your
       embed code, but if you are only changing content in the
       spreadsheet, then there's nothing else to do.
     * [X]
    What web browsers does TimelineJS work with?
       Our primary development and testing browser is Google Chrome. We
       adhere closely to web standards, so we believe that TimelineJS
       should work effectively in all modern web browsers. TimelineJS is
       known to not work with Internet Explorer versions before IE10.
     * [X]
    What are my options for changing how my Timeline looks?
       First, make sure you know everything you can do in the spreadsheet
       configuration, like background colors and images. Also, check out
       the optional settings part of 'step 3' of the authoring tool. You
       can change the fonts, the position of the timeline navigation, and
       the initial zoom level. If you still want to do more, there are
       some configuration options available. Most of those are for fine
       tuning, but some of them may be helpful.
     * [X]
    There aren't enough options. I want more control over the [font
       size/color/etc]. Can I change things using CSS?
       Because there are so many details to the styling, this is not
       exactly simple, but, if you have some technical capacity, you can
       override TimelineJS's CSS rules and have complete control over the
       look of the timeline. For details, see Using the TimelineJS CSS
       selectors. You will need to be able to instantiate the Timeline in
       javascript on your own page. (There is no way to override the CSS
       using the iframe embed.) Then, either in <style> tags in that page,
       or in an external stylesheet, you can specify CSS rules changing
       some or all of TimelineJS's default presentation. The basis of
       TimelineJS's styles are in these files, which use the Less CSS
       preprocessor.
     * [X]
    How can I categorize or group my events?
       Every event in a timeline can have a group property. Events with
       the same group are shown in the same row or adjacent rows, and the
       common value of their group property is used as a label at the left
       edge of the timeline. Groups can be set using the 'group' column in
       the Google Spreadsheet or the 'group' property of a JSON slide
       object. TimelineJS does not support any other special styling for
       events in the same group.
     * [X]
    The first slide in my timeline isn't the first chronologically. Why
       did this happen?
       When using the Google Spreadsheet to configure your timeline, if
       you put the word title in the type column, that slide will be put
       at the front, regardless of the values in the date columns. See the
       Google Spreadsheet documentation for more information.
     * [X]
    Can I make media images clickable?
       No. Many of TimelineJS's media types are interactive, and so would
       not be able to handle a link, and other of TimelineJS's media types
       have terms of service which require a link back to the source of
       the media. As an alternative, consider using HTML to add links in
       the caption, credit, or text for the slide.
     * [X]
    How can I format text (add line breaks, bold, italics)?
       TimelineJS's text fields (headline, text, caption, and credit) all
       accept HTML markup. A full tutorial on HTML is outside the scope of
       this FAQ, but here are a few basics:
          + Wrap paragraphs in <p></p> tags to create line breaks.
          + Wrap text in <b></b> tags for bold text and <i></i> for
            italics
     * [X]
    How do I enter BCE dates?
       To enter dates before the common era, just use a negative value for
       the year. Of course, you can also enter month and date if you need
       them.
     * [X]
    How do I create very ancient dates?
       Generally, you don't have to think about it -- just enter the dates
       you want. Timeline can handle dates literally to the beginning of
       time. For dates more than about 250,000 years ago, only the year is
       usable. Support for those older dates is still relatively new, so
       if anything seems off, visit our tech support site.
     * [X]
    Who can access the data in my Google spreadsheet?
       You must make the data public to the web to use TimelineJS with a
       Google Spreadsheet as the data source. Normally, the data is still
       only visible to people who know the link, so if you publish a
       timeline privately, outsiders are unlikely to see the data.
       However, it is still public, so you must decide if that is
       acceptable.
     * [X]
    Privacy is very important to me. How should I use TimelineJS?
       If you want complete control over who can see the information in
       your timeline, you cannot use Google Spreadsheets, and you cannot
       use our standard iframe embed code. Instead, you must use JSON
       format for the data and instantiate the timeline directly using
       javascript. You can then use standard web server security measures
       to control who has access to your timeline and the data used to
       create it.
     * [X]
    Will my spreadsheet get picked up by search engines?
       Under normal circumstances, Google tells search engines not to
       index spreadsheets which are published to the web. Of course, if
       the page is public on the web, it is possible that a search engine
       will disregard those instructions.
     * [X]
    Can I use TimelineJS with Wordpress?
       It depends. TimelineJS does not work with Wordpress.com sites. We
       are researching ways to address this.
       If you are able to install plugins to your Wordpress installation,
       we have a Wordpress plugin for Timeline. It supports embedding
       Timelines with Wordpress "shortcode", and as of version 3.3.14.0,
       it also has experimental "oembed" support. That means that you can
       take a direct URL to a timeline (like you get with the "get link to
       preview" button) and put it in a post on a line by itself, and it
       should be embedded. (Make sure you've updated the plugin before you
       try it.)
     * [X]
    Is TimelineJS free for commercial use?
       TimelineJS is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL),
       version 2.0. That means that TimelineJS is free to "use, reproduce,
       make available, modify, display, perform, distribute" or otherwise
       employ. You don't need our permission to publish stories with
       TimelineJS and you don't need to pay us any fees or arrange any

   Having trouble? Watch our video, or see the help section below.
    1.

Create your spreadsheet
       Build a new Google Spreadsheet using our template. You'll need to
       copy the template to your own Google Drive account by clicking the
       "Make a Copy" button.
       Drop dates, text and links to media into the appropriate columns.
       For more about working with our template, see our help docs.
       Get the Spreadsheet Template
       Don't change the column headers, don't remove any columns, and
       don't leave any blank rows in your spreadsheet.
    2.

Publish to the web
       Under the File menu, select “Publish to the Web.”
       [publish_to_web_small.png]
       In the next window, click the blue "publish" button. When asked,
       "Are you sure…?" click OK.
       Now, copy the URL that appears in the center of the window. You'll
       use this in the next step.
       [publish_to_web_button_small.png] [publish_to_web_url_small.png]
       The following has changed as of 18 July 2017!
       Close the 'Publish to the web' window. Copy the URL for your
       Timeline from the browser's address bar. It should look something
       like this:
       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xuY4upIooEeszZ_lCmeNx24eSFW
       e0rHe9ZdqH2xqVNk/edit#gid=0
       Disregard the URL that appears in the "publish to the web" window.
       It used to be used below, but changes to Google mean that you'll
       get an error if you use it now.
    3.

Generate your timeline
       Copy/paste spreadsheet URL into the box below to generate your
       timeline. (Make sure you've published the spreadsheet.)

Map Type
       Currently all Google's base maps are supported. When creating a
       Google map, style it the way you would like it to appear, and then
       paste the resulting link into your Google Spreadsheet.

Default start slide
       Slide 0___________________
       You can tell TimelineJS to start at a specific slide number.

Initial zoom level
       Zoom Level 2___________________
       The zoom level at which the timeline portion of TimelineJS will
       display on load. Specify a value from 0-10 (default is 2). Smaller
       numbers show a greater span of time.

Misc
       [ ] Start at the end
       Begins the timeline on the last slide.
       [ ] Show nav on top
       Switches the vertical order of the timeline navigation and the
       media.
       [ ] Debug
       In debug mode, the JavaScript console will display logging
       messages.
       [ ] Use hash bookmarks
       Assigns a hash bookmark to each slide's URL, allowing deep linking
       to slides. (For directly linked Timelines only -- does not work for
       iframe embeds)

Frequently asked questions

     * [X]
    How do I edit my timeline?
       Once you've created a timeline, you can make changes by going back
       to your Google spreadsheet. Changes you make to the spreadsheet are
       automatically available to your Timeline—you don't need to repeat
       the 'publish to the web' step (step #2). If you want to make
       changes to the optional settings, you will need to update your
       embed code, but if you are only changing content in the
       spreadsheet, then there's nothing else to do.
     * [X]
    What web browsers does TimelineJS work with?
       Our primary development and testing browser is Google Chrome. We
       adhere closely to web standards, so we believe that TimelineJS
       should work effectively in all modern web browsers. TimelineJS is
       known to not work with Internet Explorer versions before IE10.
     * [X]
    What are my options for changing how my Timeline looks?
       First, make sure you know everything you can do in the spreadsheet
       configuration, like background colors and images. Also, check out
       the optional settings part of 'step 3' of the authoring tool. You
       can change the fonts, the position of the timeline navigation, and
       the initial zoom level. If you still want to do more, there are
       some configuration options available. Most of those are for fine
       tuning, but some of them may be helpful.
     * [X]
    There aren't enough options. I want more control over the [font
       size/color/etc]. Can I change things using CSS?
       Because there are so many details to the styling, this is not
       exactly simple, but, if you have some technical capacity, you can
       override TimelineJS's CSS rules and have complete control over the
       look of the timeline. For details, see Using the TimelineJS CSS
       selectors. You will need to be able to instantiate the Timeline in
       javascript on your own page. (There is no way to override the CSS
       using the iframe embed.) Then, either in <style> tags in that page,
       or in an external stylesheet, you can specify CSS rules changing
       some or all of TimelineJS's default presentation. The basis of
       TimelineJS's styles are in these files, which use the Less CSS
       preprocessor.
     * [X]
    How can I categorize or group my events?
       Every event in a timeline can have a group property. Events with
       the same group are shown in the same row or adjacent rows, and the
       common value of their group property is used as a label at the left
       edge of the timeline. Groups can be set using the 'group' column in
       the Google Spreadsheet or the 'group' property of a JSON slide
       object. TimelineJS does not support any other special styling for
       events in the same group.
     * [X]
    The first slide in my timeline isn't the first chronologically. Why
       did this happen?
       When using the Google Spreadsheet to configure your timeline, if
       you put the word title in the type column, that slide will be put
       at the front, regardless of the values in the date columns. See the
       Google Spreadsheet documentation for more information.
     * [X]
    Can I make media images clickable?
       No. Many of TimelineJS's media types are interactive, and so would
       not be able to handle a link, and other of TimelineJS's media types
       have terms of service which require a link back to the source of
       the media. As an alternative, consider using HTML to add links in
       the caption, credit, or text for the slide.
     * [X]
    How can I format text (add line breaks, bold, italics)?
       TimelineJS's text fields (headline, text, caption, and credit) all
       accept HTML markup. A full tutorial on HTML is outside the scope of
       this FAQ, but here are a few basics:
          + Wrap paragraphs in <p></p> tags to create line breaks.
          + Wrap text in <b></b> tags for bold text and <i></i> for
            italics
     * [X]
    How do I enter BCE dates?
       To enter dates before the common era, just use a negative value for
       the year. Of course, you can also enter month and date if you need
       them.
     * [X]
    How do I create very ancient dates?
       Generally, you don't have to think about it -- just enter the dates
       you want. Timeline can handle dates literally to the beginning of
       time. For dates more than about 250,000 years ago, only the year is
       usable. Support for those older dates is still relatively new, so
       if anything seems off, visit our tech support site.
     * [X]
    Who can access the data in my Google spreadsheet?
       You must make the data public to the web to use TimelineJS with a
       Google Spreadsheet as the data source. Normally, the data is still
       only visible to people who know the link, so if you publish a
       timeline privately, outsiders are unlikely to see the data.
       However, it is still public, so you must decide if that is
       acceptable.
     * [X]
    Privacy is very important to me. How should I use TimelineJS?
       If you want complete control over who can see the information in
       your timeline, you cannot use Google Spreadsheets, and you cannot
       use our standard iframe embed code. Instead, you must use JSON
       format for the data and instantiate the timeline directly using
       javascript. You can then use standard web server security measures
       to control who has access to your timeline and the data used to
       create it.
     * [X]
    Will my spreadsheet get picked up by search engines?
       Under normal circumstances, Google tells search engines not to
       index spreadsheets which are published to the web. Of course, if
       the page is public on the web, it is possible that a search engine
       will disregard those instructions.
     * [X]
    Can I use TimelineJS with Wordpress?
       It depends. TimelineJS does not work with Wordpress.com sites. We
       are researching ways to address this.
       If you are able to install plugins to your Wordpress installation,
       we have a Wordpress plugin for Timeline. It supports embedding
       Timelines with Wordpress "shortcode", and as of version 3.3.14.0,
       it also has experimental "oembed" support. That means that you can
       take a direct URL to a timeline (like you get with the "get link to
       preview" button) and put it in a post on a line by itself, and it
       should be embedded. (Make sure you've updated the plugin before you
       try it.)
     * [X]
    Is TimelineJS free for commercial use?
       TimelineJS is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL),
       version 2.0. That means that TimelineJS is free to "use, reproduce,
       make available, modify, display, perform, distribute" or otherwise
       employ. You don't need our permission to publish stories with
       TimelineJS and you don't need to pay us any fees or arrange any
       further license beyond the MPL. To read more about what you can do
       with TimelineJS, read our license page.
