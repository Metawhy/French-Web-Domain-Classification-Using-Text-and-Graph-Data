   ISNI Identification

International Standard Name Identifier (ISO 27729)

   ISNI is the ISO certified global standard number for identifying the
   millions of contributors to creative works and those active in their
   distribution, including researchers, inventors, writers, artists,
   visual creators, performers, producers, publishers, aggregators, and
   more. It is part of a family of international standard identifiers that
   includes identifiers of works, recordings, products and right holders
   in all repertoires, e.g. DOI, ISAN, ISBN, ISRC, ISSN, ISTC, and ISWC.

   The mission of the ISNI International Authority (ISNI-IA) is to assign
   to the public name(s) of a researcher, inventor, writer, artist,
   performer, publisher, etc. a persistent unique identifying number in
   order to resolve the problem of name ambiguity in search and discovery;
   and diffuse each assigned ISNI across all repertoires in the global
   supply chain so that every published work can be unambiguously
   attributed to its creator wherever that work is described.

   By achieving these goals the ISNI will act as a bridge identifier
   across multiple domains and become a critical component in Linked Data
   and Semantic Web applications.
