Perform Media Privacy Notice

Perform Media Privacy Notice

1. Introduction

   Perform Media (“we”, “us” or “Perform Media”) is a business division of
   the Perform Group, headquartered in the UK.  Perform Media is a group
   of companies within the Perform Group which own, operate (either for
   ourselves or on behalf of third-parties) or represent a number of
   free-to-use digital sports media properties, which are either websites
   or mobile applications.  We also operate a video-content streaming
   service called ePlayer, which allows third-party digital publishers to
   stream sports video content on their own digital platforms.  In this
   notice, each of the properties and ePlayer platforms is referred to as
   a “platform”.  When we refer to the “Service” in this Privacy Notice,
   this means the provision of the content on the platforms to the user.

   This notice explains why Perform Media collects information concerning
   the users of the platforms (each a “user”, “you” or “your”), what type
   of information we collect and how we use that information.  This
   Privacy Notice applies to any such information collected via any
   platform which displays it (or a link to it).

   Additional information for users located in the European Economic Area
   (“EEA”), Switzerland and the UK about their rights and other
   information can be found in the Annex to this Privacy Notice.

   This notice has been last updated on 25 May 2018.

 2. What data we collect

   When a user interacts with any of the platforms, Perform Media may
   collect certain data about that user.  This data falls into 2 broad
   categories: (i) data about a user themselves, which the user gives us;
   and (ii) data about the user, or the way a user interacts with the
   platforms or Services, which is collected by us electronically
   (collectively “User Information”).

   We collect the following User Information in accordance with applicable
   law:
    1. information that users provide to us, directly or via a third-party
       registration service for the purpose of registering with us or our
       group companies;
    2. a user’s entry details for a competition or promotion;
    3. information users provide to us when users interact with our
       customer service team;
    4. information users provide when users participate in our surveys or
       marketing promotions; and
    5. information from a user’s social media profile to populate their
       profile on our platforms, and where the users chooses to register
       with us using their social media login(s);
    6. information users provide relating to reviews or ratings, favourite
       sports, tournaments, teams, events or personalities, and/or other
       subjects of interest to sports fans.
    7. information about user interactions with our platforms, and any
       direct communications the user receives from us (such as emails);
    8. device IDs or unique identifiers, location data, device and
       software characteristics (such as type and configuration),
       connection information, statistics on page views, referral URLs, ad
       data, website and app navigation, IP address and standard web log
       information;
    9. the language choices made by users in relation to their use of the
       Service, which may include information relating to their location
       when using the Service;
   10. the details of any third-party digital property (such as a website)
       that referred or linked a user to the platforms, together with
       information about how a user interacted with any online and email
       marketing campaigns related to the Service;
   11. information and communications on forums on the platforms,
       including chat rooms and message boards;
   12. information about how users behave on our platforms (such as the
       type of content they view, how frequently, at what times etc).

   We may also collect personal information from a variety of third-party
   sources.  These include social networks (subject to the user’s privacy
   settings and the privacy policy of the social network, and adopting a
   “two-click” solution where required), service providers which allow us
   to verify, enhance or supplement the User Information collected on our
   platforms, and business partners to whom we are offering a service.

3. How & why we use the data we collect

   We use the User Information for three main purposes: (i) to operate and
   improve the platforms and to ensure that we can provide the Services;
   (ii) to optimise the content on the platforms; and (iii) send marketing
   and show advertising to our users.

   More specifically, we will use the User Information to do one or more
   of the following things:
    1. administer our platforms;
    2. provide the Service requested by the user;
    3. improving the browsing experience by personalizing the Service to
       the user;
    4. recommend goods, services or promotions which may be of interest to
       the user or contact users in order to conduct market research (with
       the consent of the user, where necessary). For these purposes, we
       will create a profile about your interests and preferences which
       will enable us to increase our advertising and communication
       relevance;
    5. prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal
       activities, including fraud, cheating, and money laundering  and
       enforce our terms;
    6. to notify users about changes to our Service;
    7. send out email alerts, text messages notifications or device
       notifications in relation to our Service;
    8. send users prizes won via the platforms, and supply services
       purchased via our platforms;
    9. send notices and invoices to users, and collect payments from them;
   10. provide third parties such as our third-party digital publishers
       who deploy ePlayer with statistical and other information about our
       users as required to operate the platforms or Services;
   11. deal with enquiries and complaints;
   12. provide our commercial partners with information about users’ use
       of co-branded services, including historical use data;
   13. comply with any legal or regulatory requirements and otherwise to
       any respond to any relevant regulator or competent authority as
       required by law;
   14. understand user trends and patterns; and
   15. develop aggregate analysis in respect of our users and business
       intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed
       decisions and report on the performance of our business.

   The digital sports media platforms we operate are designed to attract
   as many users as possible.  In our case, our users are typically sports
   fans or interested in sports news and other sports-related content.
   The creation of this content, and the work that goes into ensuring that
   the platforms continue to be class-leading digital sports destinations,
   are funded by advertising revenues which we receive as a result of
   showing users advertising or other sponsored or branded content on the
   platforms.  We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that we deliver
   this advertising in a responsible way, and in allowing us to deliver it
   to the users most likely to be interested in it, and in doing so we
   employ User Information, such as the user’s location, how the user
   engages with the platforms and the content that the user views.

   More specifically, in relation to advertising:
    1. we employ User Information to select and deliver advertising that
       appears on our platforms, and to allow third-parties (such as ad
       servers) to do this on our behalf;
    2. we employ User Information to select and deliver advertising to
       users based on the way the user has interacted with our platforms,
       and to share that information with third-parties to allow them to
       do so;
    3. we may pass User Information to service providers, such as Oracle
       or Google, to allow them to provide services on our behalf or to
       partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising
       partners;
    4. we may pass User Information to advertisers or third-party
       publishers who display the ePlayer, to allow us to report on the
       advertising displayed to our users and how users interacted with
       it;
    5. we will not employ User Information to make qualitative judgments
       about individual users, nor make automated decisions in relation to
       users which could have a significant or legal effect on them, nor
       will we knowingly engage any third-party to do so.

4. Cookies

   Much of the User Information that we collect, and most of the
   information we employ in connection with advertising, is obtained via
   the use of cookies and similar technologies.  Cookies are usually a
   string of numbers and/or letters that a website transfers to a User’s
   hard drive. Similar technologies include pixel tags and web storage and
   other technologies, and we refer to all these things as “cookies” in
   this section. The cookies enable the platforms to “remember” you,
   either for the duration of your visit (session cookies) or for repeat
   visits (persistent cookies).

   On this platform, we use the following types of cookies:
    1. Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies are essential to enable
       the user to navigate around the platform securely and to provide
       the user with Services they have specifically requested.
    2. Functionality cookies – These cookies enhance the functionality of
       the platforms by storing user preferences. For instance, they can
       remember your name and location, if you provide this information
       and the types of content you are interested in.
    3. Performance cookies – These cookies improve the performance of the
       platforms. For instance, they help pages load quicker.
    4. Analytics cookies – We may use third party analytics services such
       as Google Analytics and others. Your IP address and other
       information will be collected by automated means to evaluate your
       use of the website, compile reports on website activity, identify
       user patterns and provide related services. For more information
       about how Google Analytics uses your information please click here.
       In addition, authentication and tracking logs will be used to
       compile user statistics.
    5. Targeting/advertising – These cookies help us serving of relevant
       advertisements and implement frequency capping procedures.

   These types of cookies may also be placed on the platform by our
   business partners or service providers.

   If you register with us or if you continue to use our platforms, you
   agree to our use of cookies. In some cases, when you arrive on our
   platform a pop-up message will appear asking for your consent to place
   advertising cookies on your device as required by applicable law.  In
   order to provide your consent, please click ‘OK’. Once your consent has
   been provided, this message will not appear again when you revisit,
   unless you delete cookies via your browser settings or otherwise.

   Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you
   can change your browser to prevent that, or opt-out as explained below.
   You may not be able to take full advantage of our platforms or use
   certain functions if you disable cookies.

5. Disclosure of User Information

   We may share User Information with any member of the Perform group
   (www.performgroup.com) where this is necessary for business
   administration purposes in accordance with applicable law.  We may also
   allow other members of the Perform group to contact users with relevant
   offers, competitions and latest news (where they have consented to
   doing so, if required by applicable laws).

   We may also share User Information with selected third parties
   including:
    1. business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors in connection with
       providing Services to our users.
    2. advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to
       select and serve relevant adverts to the user.
    3. analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the
       improvement and optimisation of the platforms.
    4. if we decide to sell the business operating the Service or it is
       integrated with another business, we may disclose User Information
       to our advisers and any prospective buyer’s advisers as well as to
       the new owners of the business.
    5. if we are under a duty to disclose or share a user’s personal
       information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in
       order to enforce or apply our terms;
    6. in order to prevent fraud, cheating and money laundering we may
       disclose User Information and betting and gaming history to third
       parties including, but not limited to, any relevant regulator,
       gaming and sporting bodies, financial institutions and law
       enforcement agencies or any other body that deals with the
       investigation of alleged offences.

   Where relevant, we will disclose User Information and anonymized
   information associated with a user’s use of and interaction with the
   platforms to the partner on whose behalf we operate that platform, for
   the purposes of marketing and advertising, and to promote their own
   products and services.

6. Your right to opt-out

   If you would like us to stop sending you marketing communications you
   may use the opt-out link here, the unsubscribe link in our marketing
   communications or by amending your App settings. Although we encourage
   you to use the opt-out link and App settings because it is automated,
   you may also contact us here.

   If you, or another user of your device, wish to withdraw your cookies
   consent at any time, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies
   by modifying your browser setting. You may also go
   to www.allaboutcookies.org or www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are in
   Europe, or to www.aboutads.info/choices if you are anywhere else for
   instructions on how to disable cookies. You may opt-out from Google
   Analytics here. In some instances, when you opt-out, a new cookie
   (Opt-Out-Cookie) is placed in your web browser. This tells the third
   party provider to cease data collection from your browser and prevents
   advertisements from being delivered to you.

7. Security

   We understand that the security of your User Information is important
   to you.  When handling User Information, security is paramount and we
   seek to ensure that User Information is protected through appropriate
   technical and organisational measures.

   We use reasonable administrative, logical and physical controls,
   including password protection, to safeguard your User Information
   against loss, theft and unauthorised access, use or modification.
   Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
   completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your User
   Information in accordance with applicable law, we cannot guarantee the
   security of your User Information.

8. International data transfers

   Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and
   transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order
   to enable us to use the information in accordance with this notice.

   Information which you provide may be transferred to our group
   companies, commercial partners, suppliers or agents located outside
   your country as set out in paragraph 5 above. We will ensure adequate
   protection of personal data transferred outside of your country as
   required under applicable laws. For example, if you are located in the
   EEA, Swiss or in the UK, we may enter into model clauses with the
   recipient. You may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we
   have put in place to protect your personal data in these circumstances.

   In addition, personal information that you submit for publication on
   the platforms will be published on the internet and may be available,
   via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use or misuse
   of such information by others.

9. Parents and guardians

   Our platforms are not directly intended for children and should not be
   used by them unless supervised by a parent or guardian.

10. Contact

   Questions, comments and requests regarding this Privacy Notice are
   welcomed and should be addressed to customerservices@performgroup.com

11. Changes

   We reserve the right to change the practices described in this Privacy
   Notice at any time by posting an updated Privacy Notice.  Please check
   here periodically.  If we amend this notice, your continued use of our
   platforms will amount to your acknowledgement of the amended notice.

   ANNEX TO PRIVACY NOTICE – INFORMATION FOR EEA, SWISS AND UK INDIVIDUALS

   In order to comply with data privacy regulations in the EEA,
   Switzerland and the UK, Perform Media provides additional information
   to its EEA, Switzerland and UK based users.

   What is personal data?

   “Personal data” is information about you (a “data subject”) the use of
   which is governed by applicable data protection laws. It will include
   any information from which you can be identified, directly or
   indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as your
   name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or
   other information about your identity. Most User Information will
   constitute personal data.

   Who is responsible for your personal data?

   If you use our Service, the Data Controller is:

   Perform Media Services Ltd
   Sussex House
   Plane Tree Crescent
   Feltham
   TW13 7HE
   United Kingdom

   Perform Media Services Ltd is registered as a data controller with the
   Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK (registration number
   ZA188575).

   What is the legal basis on which Perform relies to process your
   personal data?

   On some occasions, we process your personal data with your consent (for
   example, when you agree to participate in our surveys and other
   activities or when you give us consent to send you marketing
   communications (adopting a “double-opt-in” where required) or to deal
   with your enquiries, as set out in paragraph 3 letter (d)).

   On other occasions, we process your personal data when we need to do
   this in order to fulfil a contract with you (for example, to make
   available to you the requested content or for billing purposes) or in
   order to take steps prior to entering into a contract (for example,
   verifying your information), as set out in paragraph 3 letters (a),
   (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k).

   We also process your personal data when it is in our legitimate
   interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by
   your data protection rights, as set out in paragraph 3 letters (c),
   (e), (j), (k), (l), (n) and (o). For example, we may process your
   personal data in our legitimate interests to ensure that our platforms
   and Services are provided efficiently and in an user-friendly and
   personalised manner taking into account user feedback, data and
   profiles, unless consent is required for any such processing under
   applicable law. We will process personal data to ensure the security of
   our business and the information of our users, and to ensure the proper
   and efficient administration of our business. You may contact us for
   further information.

   Finally, we will process your personal data where we are required to do
   this by law (for example, where we have to fulfil anti-money laundering
   requirements or disclose information under a court order), as set out
   in paragraph 3 letters (f), (g), (k) and (m).

   How long does Perform keep data?

   Perform Media keeps your data for only as long as required to provide
   you with the necessary Services and to carry out the processing set out
   in this notice, and in line with its obligation under applicable law.
   This means that we will generally not keep your personal information
   for longer than six years following your last interaction with us, and
   the retention period will often be shorter. For example, we may keep
   your information for marketing purposes for a period of 3 years
   following the termination or expiry of our relationship, or your last
   contact with us.

   Your rights

   Data subjects may ask us for a copy of their information, to correct
   it, erase it or to transfer it to other organisations at their request.
   Data subjects also have rights to object to some processing including
   profiling and, where we have asked for their consent to process the
   data subject’s data, to withdraw this consent. In particular, data
   subjects have the right to object to direct marketing at any time.
   Where a data subject withdraws their consent, this will not affect the
   legitimacy of the processing conducted prior to your request.  Where we
   process data because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (as
   explained above), the data subject has a right to object to this. Where
   we make a decision based solely on automated processing which
   significantly affects the data subject, he or she may have the right to
   contest the decision, express his or her point of view and obtain human
   intervention.

   These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we
   can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data.

   Please use the contact information set out in our Contact section
   above. We will aim to acknowledge your enquiries within 72 hours and
   respond within one month, unless otherwise required by law.

   We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we
   process your data. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also
   have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.
