Exclusive: Quentin Tarantino Tells Us How and Why He Created ‘The Hateful
Eight’ Miniseries for Netflix

   Posted on Wednesday, May 1st, 2019 by Chris Evangelista

   hateful eight netflix mini-series

   A month ago, word arrived that an extended version of Quentin
   Tarantino‘s 2015 Western The Hateful Eight would be arriving on
   Netflix. Many (including this writer) assumed this was going to be the
   Roadshow Cut – a cut that played in limited theatrical release, and was
   never released on home video. But that’s not what happened.

   Instead, The Hateful Eight arrived on Netflix broken into a miniseries,
   consisting of four episodes. How, and why, did this happen? And was
   Tarantino involved? It turns out he was. The filmmaker curated and
   oversaw the new miniseries cut himself.

   Tarantino spoke to /Film exclusively about how the Hateful Eight
   Netflix miniseries came together. The filmmaker also spoke of a new
   director’s cut of another one of his films, and whether or not he’s
   going to make that rumored Star Trek movie.

   So I guess my two big questions on this are how and why; how did this
   come about and how much input did you have into it? And what was the
   genesis of it, breaking it up into these episodes?

   Well, we finished the whole run of the movie. And I had no reason at
   this time to put the Roadshow version out; because that was [its own
   thing]…it was about that 70 millimeter screening. So as far as
   [releasing] the whole prologue and the intermission, that didn’t seem
   to really make much sense, unless it was playing on TCM Roadshow week
   or something.

   So Netflix came to us and said, “Hey, look, if you’d be interested–if
   there’s even more footage, [and] if you’d be interested in putting it
   together in a way that we could show it as three or four episodes,
   depending on how much extra footage you have, we’d be willing to do
   that.”

   And I thought, wow, that’s really intriguing. I mean, the movie exists
   as a movie, but if I were to use all the footage we shot, and see if I
   could put it together in episode form, I was game to give that a shot.

   So about a year after it’s released, maybe a little less, me and my
   editor, Fred Raskin, we got together and then we worked real hard. We
   edited the film down into 50 minute bits, and we very easily got four
   episodes out of it. We didn’t re-edit the whole thing from scratch, but
   we did a whole lot of re-editing, and it plays differently. Some
   sequences are more similar than others compared to the film, but it has
   a different feeling. It has a different feeling that I actually really
   like a lot. And there was [already] a literary aspect to the film
   anyway, so it definitely has this “chapters unfolding” quality.

   There’s been some debate about whether or not there’s new footage–

   Yeah, it’s really frustrating that on one hand, it seems like every
   website in the world wants to write about it, but no one wants to
   actually watch it. So they could actually see for themselves if it’s
   different. Like, 42 different websites would rather speculate on if
   it’s different rather than just watch it. So it’s all this
   misconception. “Oh, they’re just replaying the credits…it’s just only
   what was in the roadshow version.” No! I don’t know [an exact] timeline
   as far as how much new footage is in it, but it’s something like about,
   like, 25 minutes if not more.

   And there are sequences that play very different. You know, one of the
   things in it that I like a lot, and it was one of the things [that]
   didn’t quite work in the feature, we had moved on, but in this kind of
   situation it was different. Have you seen the movie?

   Yes.

   Okay. So when you have the situation where the four passengers come in,
   and take over the place and kill everybody, and they kind of set up the
   place for when the stagecoach arrives.

   Well, the way it’s in the [original] movie is, instead of me saying,
   “But then when John Ruth and Daisy arrived…”, that’s when we cut out of
   that sequence, and go back….What we’re able to do in this version, is
   John Ruth and Daisy now enter the place, and you see the entire
   sequence again. John Ruth and Daisy enter Minnie’s Haberdashery, except
   now it’s not told from John Ruth and Daisy’s perspective. It’s told
   from the killers’ perspective…We know what they’ve done, and we know
   how they set up, and we know Daisy knows who they are…So we see how Tim
   Roth and how Michael Madsen and how Daisy are reacting to each other,
   while John Ruth is oblivious.

   the hateful eight extended version

   I have a question just about the movie itself. I’m wondering if you
   yourself think this movie came out like a year or two early. I remember
   this came out Christmas 2015 and I remember there was this – I loved
   the movie, first of all, I think it’s fantastic. But it’s a really
   brutal movie. It deals with misogyny and racism, and obviously those
   things aren’t new. They’ve always been there, but it seems like a year
   later, you know, we had the election and all this…all this ugly stuff
   that I feel like a lot of Americans thought was buried came out again,
   in full force. And when that happened, it made me think of this movie a
   lot because I feel like the movie is dealing with that in some way.

   Yeah, they’re still fighting the war…in their own racist terms.

   It felt like if this had come out in 2016 instead of 2015 the reaction
   would have been so much different, just because that ugliness was at
   the forefront again.

   Well, just so you’ll know, I read your piece. I was really taken with
   it. I really liked it. I, uh, I appreciate you calling us prescient. I
   have to say…I didn’t really think about it [at the time]. Like I knew I
   had made an ugly little movie. And if you make an ugly little movie
   people might not respond so great, okay, that goes with wanting to make
   something, uh, this rancid. But I love it…but I can understand it’s not
   really a dish for everybody but the truth of the matter is, I didn’t
   think about any of that. I just thought it was just the nature of the
   beast. But when I read your piece, I was like, “Hey, he might have a
   point.”

   So going back to the Netflix element, would you want to do something
   like this again, for like, say, [Kill Bill] The Whole Bloody Affair? Or
   is this a one time thing for you?

   [There’s] the idea that now you can make a movie, and the movie is the
   movie, and the movie has all the limitations that the movie has that a
   novel doesn’t have, that’s the way it is. But the idea that after that,
   after that is done, after that movie is said and done, not that that’s
   just some ghost or some weird little version, but the idea that you
   could have a fuller version come out, after the fact, that’s kind of
   exciting. That’s kind of interesting. Now, in the case of Kill Bill the
   Whole Bloody Affair, Kill Bill is the one movie I’ve made where
   everything I shot is in the movie, because we had two movies.

   But for instance, take Django [Unchained], I’ve actually cut a
   director’s cut of Django. That’s about like three hours and 15 minutes,
   or three hours and 20 minutes, something like that. That’s one I
   wouldn’t do as a miniseries, because it would just be better [as a
   movie]. I thought about that idea, but that would just work better as
   one movie. Just a longer one as far as I was concerned. So I’ve
   actually done that. We’re just kind of waiting some time after Once
   Upon A Time in Hollywood, and we’ll release that eventually.

   And what’s the status of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood?

   I’m on the mix-stage right now.

   I feel like I have to ask this even though I don’t know if you’ll want
   to answer. But are you going to make a Star Trek movie? Is there any
   truth to that?

   It’s a very big possibility. I haven’t been dealing with those guys for
   a while cause I’ve been making my movie. But we’ve talked about a story
   and a script. The script has been written and when I emerge my head
   like Punxsutawney Phil, post-Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, we’ll pick
   up talking about it again.

   With the Hateful Eight Netflix cut, what would you say to interest
   people; to tell them this is something new instead of just what they’ve
   seen before?

   Well if you like the movie, the movie is a movie, and I worked really
   hard [on it]. So even if I come out with a version that has more stuff
   in it, that doesn’t invalidate the first version.

   The first version is what we chose to be the movie. But now if you’ve
   seen that, and you like that, and you want more, this version gives you
   more…and it gives you more in a slightly different format. The movie
   doesn’t necessarily need to be like one longer movie. It was a pretty
   long movie [to begin with]. But this gave me an opportunity to, rather
   than just make a super duper epic, I could actually use all of my
   ideas…my scripts are always told with really complex narrative ideas…

   Now, in the course of editing a movie, a lot of those ideas go by the
   wayside, because ultimately it’s not serving your purpose for making a
   linear movie. But in this case, I was able to put it all back in. And
   if you’re just watching it like a chapter at a [time], which is
   basically 50 minutes at a time, then you’re able to absorb it. And in a
   fun way, you’re able to look at it slightly differently. Do you want to
   keep watching it? You can, but you don’t have to. Each episode ends it
   an emotional place and you’re also able to see the whole original
   narrative complexity of the whole piece.

   This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

‘It: Chapter Two’ Director Andy Muschietti on His “Definitive” Cut of the
‘It’ Saga, Designing Creepy Creatures, and More [Spoiler Interview]

   Posted on Friday, September 6th, 2019 by Ben Pearson

   It Chapter 2 spoilers

   After breaking out with his low-budget horror film Mama in 2013,
   director Andy Muschietti rocketed to the big time by directing 2017’s
   It, which adapted the child-centric storyline in Stephen King’s
   sprawling 1986 novel. That film was a box office juggernaut, and now
   he’s back with It: Chapter Two, a sequel that picks up 27 years after
   the original and sees the Losers’ Club reunite in Derry, Maine to
   battle Pennywise (Bill Skarsgärd) once again.

   I spoke with Muschietti about his rumored supercut that would combine
   the two films, the new footage he would add to that, his intention
   behind some of this movie’s creepiest creatures, putting his own touch
   on King’s source material, and much more.

   Warning: Spoilers ahead.

It Chapter 2 Spoilers with Andy Muschietti

   Congratulations on the movie.

   Thanks, did you enjoy it?

   I did. I’m a huge fan of the book and I know that you are too, and my
   first question is, how do you distinguish between moments of this movie
   that need to be adapted directly and areas where you have the freedom
   to put your own touches on it?

   I identified what makes a good film experience or not, because it’s
   basically adapting to a different language. So we took the pieces of
   the story that actually can be translated and there’s a space for new
   events that basically turn the screws of tension a little more, and
   make all the events more consequential. So there was a big space for
   creating those events. When you read the book, all that section happens
   in a longer time, it’s not necessarily consequential even though
   there’s a clear goal. But it’s also interrupted by flashbacks that last
   for chapters and interludes from Mike, so when you translate it to a
   film experience, you basically make everything consequential, make
   those adjustments so it’s an escalation, and crank up the tension.
   That’s the criteria, basically.

   The creature designs seem to be an area where you can inject some of
   your own twisted imagery. For those aspects, are you trying to capture
   imagery that disturbs you personally?

   You couldn’t say it better. Yeah. Absolutely. It all comes from the
   inside. I have to design creatures that would scare me if I saw the for
   the first time.

   I think the bug with a baby’s head in the Jade of the Orient sequence
   is going to mess up some kids who see this movie a few years earlier
   than they should.

   I know, I know. The baby bug is not something that you see in the book.
   It’s like a weird hybrid of imagination that’s pretty cool and
   disturbing, because it’s a horrible blend. It taps a little bit into
   the fact that nobody had babies, so it’s something that’s wedged in
   there, a theme. None of them had babies. Why? Because they had to stay
   children to access the power of belief. So I tossed the baby face on
   the bug, and it’s so disturbing. It doesn’t really need an explanation,
   because Pennywise is trying to generate chaos and fear. So I kept the
   eyeball that I really liked from the book, but then there’s a bat wing
   (laughs), that doesn’t need further explanation because it’s so fucking
   creepy. And then the floating heads of the kids that are still singing
   this Chinese restaurant tune. It’s chaos more than anything.

   Tell me about the scene with Bill having his vision, seeing the origins
   of It. That stuff is pretty wild in the novel – how did you go about
   creating that scene visually?

   One of the events in the original book is this psychoactive trip the
   kids have when they go to the smoke house. But there wasn’t really a
   place in the first movie to put it, starting with the fact that the
   first movie was – well, we had budget limitations and wanted to make a
   contained movie. I wanted to put the smoke house in the first one, but
   I couldn’t do it. But because it’s an event that I think people really
   remember, that vision of It coming to Earth for the first time millions
   of years go, sort of in the shape of an asteroid crashing to Earth.

   So we managed to find a place for that, and the whole Ritual of Chud
   was, the function of it was giving Mike something to lie about. Because
   Mike ultimately wants to use the only weapon that the Losers Club has,
   which is the power of belief. These characters are not children
   anymore, so they don’t have that. They don’t have the imagination or
   the innocence to believe in things that don’t exist. So he lies to them
   (laughs), invokes this thing that is basically mythological, that
   apparently worked before in the past, but it’s bullshit. It’s something
   that actually never worked. But it doesn’t matter, because if you
   believe, it will work. The piece of information that Mike has from the
   first movie – many people don’t remember this, but when they’re
   confronting Pennywise and Bill is holding this stun bolt gun that isn’t
   loaded, and all the kids think there’s a load there, and the only one
   that doesn’t is Mike. He’s like, ‘It’s unloaded, it’s unloaded!’ and
   all the kids are like, ‘Kill it, kill it, kill it!’ When Bill fires,
   they draw a big hole on Pennywise’s face. That was an indication for
   Mike that the power of unified belief is a weapon. After years and
   years of doing research, he comes to a dead end, he notices that
   there’s nothing…except for the element, which is belief. Pennywise uses
   that as a weapon, because he makes kids believe. But the truth is, it’s
   a weapon that can be turned against him.

   The Adrian Mellon scene is one of the most vicious things in the entire
   movie, and while a lot of the film’s violence is heightened, the
   violence inflicted on him is sadly something that still happens
   regularly in real life. I’ve heard you say that that’s why it was
   important to include, but were you ever concerned with the idea of
   portraying that realistic type of violence?

   No, I think it had to be realistic to show that the brutality of It is
   something that comes from human perversion, from human cruelty, and I
   didn’t want to hold back on that. Even Stephen King, when he included
   this in his story, it’s because it happened in his town. The murder of
   Charlie Howard in 1984. He was already making a story about the cruelty
   of humans in a small American town. It was very important for him, and
   very important for me, also. I think it’s relevant to a time when these
   things are still happening, you know?

   Yes. One of the things that is so present throughout the novel and the
   first movie is how the town of Derry has a sickness, almost like an
   infection because of It’s presence. Aside from the Adrian sequence,
   that element of the story doesn’t really come into play very much in
   Chapter Two. Were there additional scenes you shot that continued that
   thread for this movie?

   Of adults being evil?

   Yeah, and the town itself.

   Well, it’s established in the first one. I had a movie that was four
   hours, my first cut, so I had to basically lift some things that were
   secondary to the main plot. I think people that have the first movie
   fresh, they already have a feeling of how adults are. In fact, in the
   second movie you can still feel – you go back to a flashback with
   Beverly where we see her dad and his twisted way in which he abuses
   her. We learn a little more about it. We know where that comes from,
   spraying perfume on her, trying to recreate his dead wife.

   You mentioned your first cut was four hours. Was that just an assembly
   cut, or was that actually something that you would have been happy with
   audiences watching?

   No, no, not at all. That was an editorial cut, which is the thing you
   see when you finish shooting. So as you’re shooting, your editor is
   sort of assembling the movie with all the things that you shot,
   basically, all the scenes unaltered. That was four hours. After that, I
   started my director’s cut, which was three hours and twenty-five
   minutes. It’s tighter, I had the scenes the way I wanted them. But
   then, of course, 3:25, even though we did a test screening with that
   version that had a surprisingly high score, which is 82, that’s
   definitely a tribute to the audience’s love for the first one. But
   there were opportunities there to trim it, to refine it into a better
   film experience for the audience. And that’s what we did.

   There have been lots of stories about a potential supercut, and while I
   know that hasn’t been confirmed yet, could you tell me about some of
   the new material you would want to include if that ends up happening?

   Well, I can’t talk about it because I want to keep it under wraps a
   little bit. But one of them is something from the book, and the other
   is a thing that is new. It’s related to a resolution of the
   perpetrators of Adrian Mellon’s beating.

   Oh, OK. I was wondering about that.

   Bringing some justice.

   If you had your way, would that supercut version be something people
   could watch in a theater, or would that be designed specifically for a
   home video release?

   It feels more like a home video release. People won’t sit in a cinema
   for more than three hours, but on the other hand, they would binge
   [things] in their home for hours. I really don’t know what form it will
   have on home video, whether you buy it as six episodes, or what. It’s
   the same. At the end, it’s the same, because people that want to keep
   going, they will keep going. But it’s definitely, without shooting
   another movie, it’s a definitive, global edition of the whole story, so
   that’s why I wanted to include a couple of scenes that were not shot.
   Sort of like what Spielberg did with, not that it was two parts, but
   the special edition of Close Encounters. They released it, he shot
   more, then they rereleased it, and people poured to the cinema to see
   what that extra footage was.

   I want to ask you about It: Chapter Two specifically. What is the
   element that you are most proud of when you look back on the making of
   this movie?

   I think apart from the new spectacle that Chapter Two brings compared
   to the first one, the scope, scale, bigger canvas, I’m proud of the
   emotional journey. I’m proud of the emotional conclusion to this story,
   probably because it’s the thing that still gets me when I see the movie
   after watching it like 200 times. I still see the things that get me,
   like Richie holding Eddie in the cavern, the guys in the quarry, in the
   water at the end holding each other as a group. These bits still get
   me, and I think they work because it was well built throughout the two
   movies. I think there was an emotional engagement that was achieved. I
   see it in people, I see people coming out of the theater with teary
   eyes, and that’s the greatest reward.

   There was a report earlier this summer that you were in talks to direct
   The Flash. I don’t even want to get into the specifics of that with
   you, but I just want to ask hypothetically speaking, what would you
   like to see in a Flash movie?

   Well, I would be revealing too much, maybe. (laughs) I can’t talk about
   it yet, because we’re still in the beginning phase of that. But it’s
   very exciting. That I can tell you.

   It: Chapter Two is in theaters now.

‘Pelican Blood’ Review: A Powerful Portrait of Sacrifice and Motherhood
[Fantastic Fest 2019]

   Posted on Thursday, October 3rd, 2019 by Marisa Mirabal

   One of the defining traits of a mother is her unconditional love. No
   matter how rotten a child can be, a mother’s love can be undying and
   never waiver through troubled waters. It is both a blessing and a curse
   – this endless devotion and sacrifice that comes with being a parent.
   But just how far does that love go? How much can one parent give and
   risk in order to help a child that is seemingly hopeless?

   In her sophomore feature Pelican Blood, writer/director Katrin Gebbe
   captures the immense dedication that mothers can exude despite the most
   defiant and dangerous kids they try to nurture and protect.

‘Zombi Child’ Review: A Chilling and Wholly Unique Take on the Walking Dead
[NYFF 2019]

   Posted on Thursday, October 3rd, 2019 by Caroline Cao

   Zombi Child Review

   A pufferfish is sliced. Poison is stashed into a shoe. An unwitting
   victim (Mackenson Bijou) puts on that shoe and walks the street of 1962
   Haiti. Then he falls dead. He is buried. The corpse appears to hear the
   beat of dirt shoving on his casket. Inexplicably, the scene cuts to the
   walking corpse being dragged to a sugarcane farm. Now a “zombi,” he is
   forced into slavery with others like him. As automation with head
   bowed, the zombi slaves have no will to break from orders. Until one
   day, when the zombi breaks from slave labor and watches his
   civilization from the distance.

   This tale is lifted from the strange case of Clairvius Narcisse, a
   real-life documented “zombi”, a man who was buried alive before he
   returned to his society. (His tale also inspired Wes Craven’s The
   Serpent and the Rainbow). “Zombi” is the Haitian-French original
   spelling of the widely-known “Zombie.” And the “Zombi” of Zombi Child
   isn’t your conventional Hollywood walking dead. While Clairvius moans,
   elicit glassy stares, and gaits with bodily convulsions, Clairvius’s
   zombi form bears flesh that looks healthy on the outside rather than
   visibly torn. But his pain is inward, a starving for release from an
   ache he cannot articulate even when he finds the will to depart from
   the grueling labor.

‘Wrinkles the Clown’ Director Michael Beach Nichols on Internet Urban Legends
and Why We’re Afraid of Clowns [Interview]

   Posted on Thursday, October 3rd, 2019 by Rafael Motamayor

   Wrinkles the Clown Trailer

   Right in-between Pennywise the Dancing Clown and Joaquin Phoenix’ Clown
   Prince of Crime, a different type of clown wants to make it to the big
   screen – Wrinkles the Clown. Director Michael Beach Nichols takes a
   hard look at one of the most fascinating Internet legends of the past
   few years, a clown that is apparently hired by parents to scare their
   kids. As Marisa Mirabal wrote for the site, Wrinkles the Clown is an
   intriguing magic trick of a film, and it’s true, Nichols takes a simple
   premise – investigating the story behind a viral 2014 YouTube video
   that showed a sinister clown mask-wearing individual emerging from
   underneath a child’s bed – and evolves it into an exploration of the
   internet itself and its ability to spread wild tales and why we love to
   feel scared.

   I had the opportunity to interview the man behind the documentary,
   director Michael Beach Nichols, at Fantastic Fest and talk about the
   film, its big twist, the internet and more. For clarity and
   spoilers-sake, the interview has been edited so as to not ruin the
   surprise, and believe me – you’ll want to experience the insanity that
   is Wrinkles The Clown yourself when it arrives on October 4, 2019.

Exclusive: Quentin Tarantino Tells Us How and Why He Created ‘The Hateful
Eight’ Miniseries for Netflix

   Posted on Wednesday, May 1st, 2019 by Chris Evangelista

   hateful eight netflix mini-series

   A month ago, word arrived that an extended version of Quentin
   Tarantino‘s 2015 Western The Hateful Eight would be arriving on
   Netflix. Many (including this writer) assumed this was going to be the
   Roadshow Cut – a cut that played in limited theatrical release, and was
   never released on home video. But that’s not what happened.

   Instead, The Hateful Eight arrived on Netflix broken into a miniseries,
   consisting of four episodes. How, and why, did this happen? And was
   Tarantino involved? It turns out he was. The filmmaker curated and
   oversaw the new miniseries cut himself.

   Tarantino spoke to /Film exclusively about how the Hateful Eight
   Netflix miniseries came together. The filmmaker also spoke of a new
   director’s cut of another one of his films, and whether or not he’s
   going to make that rumored Star Trek movie.

   So I guess my two big questions on this are how and why; how did this
   come about and how much input did you have into it? And what was the
   genesis of it, breaking it up into these episodes?

   Well, we finished the whole run of the movie. And I had no reason at
   this time to put the Roadshow version out; because that was [its own
   thing]…it was about that 70 millimeter screening. So as far as
   [releasing] the whole prologue and the intermission, that didn’t seem
   to really make much sense, unless it was playing on TCM Roadshow week
   or something.

   So Netflix came to us and said, “Hey, look, if you’d be interested–if
   there’s even more footage, [and] if you’d be interested in putting it
   together in a way that we could show it as three or four episodes,
   depending on how much extra footage you have, we’d be willing to do
   that.”

   And I thought, wow, that’s really intriguing. I mean, the movie exists
   as a movie, but if I were to use all the footage we shot, and see if I
   could put it together in episode form, I was game to give that a shot.

   So about a year after it’s released, maybe a little less, me and my
   editor, Fred Raskin, we got together and then we worked real hard. We
   edited the film down into 50 minute bits, and we very easily got four
   episodes out of it. We didn’t re-edit the whole thing from scratch, but
   we did a whole lot of re-editing, and it plays differently. Some
   sequences are more similar than others compared to the film, but it has
   a different feeling. It has a different feeling that I actually really
   like a lot. And there was [already] a literary aspect to the film
   anyway, so it definitely has this “chapters unfolding” quality.

   There’s been some debate about whether or not there’s new footage–

   Yeah, it’s really frustrating that on one hand, it seems like every
   website in the world wants to write about it, but no one wants to
   actually watch it. So they could actually see for themselves if it’s
   different. Like, 42 different websites would rather speculate on if
   it’s different rather than just watch it. So it’s all this
   misconception. “Oh, they’re just replaying the credits…it’s just only
   what was in the roadshow version.” No! I don’t know [an exact] timeline
   as far as how much new footage is in it, but it’s something like about,
   like, 25 minutes if not more.

   And there are sequences that play very different. You know, one of the
   things in it that I like a lot, and it was one of the things [that]
   didn’t quite work in the feature, we had moved on, but in this kind of
   situation it was different. Have you seen the movie?

   Yes.

   Okay. So when you have the situation where the four passengers come in,
   and take over the place and kill everybody, and they kind of set up the
   place for when the stagecoach arrives.

   Well, the way it’s in the [original] movie is, instead of me saying,
   “But then when John Ruth and Daisy arrived…”, that’s when we cut out of
   that sequence, and go back….What we’re able to do in this version, is
   John Ruth and Daisy now enter the place, and you see the entire
   sequence again. John Ruth and Daisy enter Minnie’s Haberdashery, except
   now it’s not told from John Ruth and Daisy’s perspective. It’s told
   from the killers’ perspective…We know what they’ve done, and we know
   how they set up, and we know Daisy knows who they are…So we see how Tim
   Roth and how Michael Madsen and how Daisy are reacting to each other,
   while John Ruth is oblivious.

   the hateful eight extended version

   I have a question just about the movie itself. I’m wondering if you
   yourself think this movie came out like a year or two early. I remember
   this came out Christmas 2015 and I remember there was this – I loved
   the movie, first of all, I think it’s fantastic. But it’s a really
   brutal movie. It deals with misogyny and racism, and obviously those
   things aren’t new. They’ve always been there, but it seems like a year
   later, you know, we had the election and all this…all this ugly stuff
   that I feel like a lot of Americans thought was buried came out again,
   in full force. And when that happened, it made me think of this movie a
   lot because I feel like the movie is dealing with that in some way.

   Yeah, they’re still fighting the war…in their own racist terms.

   It felt like if this had come out in 2016 instead of 2015 the reaction
   would have been so much different, just because that ugliness was at
   the forefront again.

   Well, just so you’ll know, I read your piece. I was really taken with
   it. I really liked it. I, uh, I appreciate you calling us prescient. I
   have to say…I didn’t really think about it [at the time]. Like I knew I
   had made an ugly little movie. And if you make an ugly little movie
   people might not respond so great, okay, that goes with wanting to make
   something, uh, this rancid. But I love it…but I can understand it’s not
   really a dish for everybody but the truth of the matter is, I didn’t
   think about any of that. I just thought it was just the nature of the
   beast. But when I read your piece, I was like, “Hey, he might have a
   point.”

   So going back to the Netflix element, would you want to do something
   like this again, for like, say, [Kill Bill] The Whole Bloody Affair? Or
   is this a one time thing for you?

   [There’s] the idea that now you can make a movie, and the movie is the
   movie, and the movie has all the limitations that the movie has that a
   novel doesn’t have, that’s the way it is. But the idea that after that,
   after that is done, after that movie is said and done, not that that’s
   just some ghost or some weird little version, but the idea that you
   could have a fuller version come out, after the fact, that’s kind of
   exciting. That’s kind of interesting. Now, in the case of Kill Bill the
   Whole Bloody Affair, Kill Bill is the one movie I’ve made where
   everything I shot is in the movie, because we had two movies.

   But for instance, take Django [Unchained], I’ve actually cut a
   director’s cut of Django. That’s about like three hours and 15 minutes,
   or three hours and 20 minutes, something like that. That’s one I
   wouldn’t do as a miniseries, because it would just be better [as a
   movie]. I thought about that idea, but that would just work better as
   one movie. Just a longer one as far as I was concerned. So I’ve
   actually done that. We’re just kind of waiting some time after Once
   Upon A Time in Hollywood, and we’ll release that eventually.

   And what’s the status of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood?

   I’m on the mix-stage right now.

   I feel like I have to ask this even though I don’t know if you’ll want
   to answer. But are you going to make a Star Trek movie? Is there any
   truth to that?

   It’s a very big possibility. I haven’t been dealing with those guys for
   a while cause I’ve been making my movie. But we’ve talked about a story
   and a script. The script has been written and when I emerge my head
   like Punxsutawney Phil, post-Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, we’ll pick
   up talking about it again.

   With the Hateful Eight Netflix cut, what would you say to interest
   people; to tell them this is something new instead of just what they’ve
   seen before?

   Well if you like the movie, the movie is a movie, and I worked really
   hard [on it]. So even if I come out with a version that has more stuff
   in it, that doesn’t invalidate the first version.

   The first version is what we chose to be the movie. But now if you’ve
   seen that, and you like that, and you want more, this version gives you
   more…and it gives you more in a slightly different format. The movie
   doesn’t necessarily need to be like one longer movie. It was a pretty
   long movie [to begin with]. But this gave me an opportunity to, rather
   than just make a super duper epic, I could actually use all of my
   ideas…my scripts are always told with really complex narrative ideas…

   Now, in the course of editing a movie, a lot of those ideas go by the
   wayside, because ultimately it’s not serving your purpose for making a
   linear movie. But in this case, I was able to put it all back in. And
   if you’re just watching it like a chapter at a [time], which is
   basically 50 minutes at a time, then you’re able to absorb it. And in a
   fun way, you’re able to look at it slightly differently. Do you want to
   keep watching it? You can, but you don’t have to. Each episode ends it
   an emotional place and you’re also able to see the whole original
   narrative complexity of the whole piece.

   This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

‘It: Chapter Two’ Director Andy Muschietti on His “Definitive” Cut of the
‘It’ Saga, Designing Creepy Creatures, and More [Spoiler Interview]

   Posted on Friday, September 6th, 2019 by Ben Pearson

   It Chapter 2 spoilers

   After breaking out with his low-budget horror film Mama in 2013,
   director Andy Muschietti rocketed to the big time by directing 2017’s
   It, which adapted the child-centric storyline in Stephen King’s
   sprawling 1986 novel. That film was a box office juggernaut, and now
   he’s back with It: Chapter Two, a sequel that picks up 27 years after
   the original and sees the Losers’ Club reunite in Derry, Maine to
   battle Pennywise (Bill Skarsgärd) once again.

   I spoke with Muschietti about his rumored supercut that would combine
   the two films, the new footage he would add to that, his intention
   behind some of this movie’s creepiest creatures, putting his own touch
   on King’s source material, and much more.

   Warning: Spoilers ahead.

It Chapter 2 Spoilers with Andy Muschietti

   Congratulations on the movie.

   Thanks, did you enjoy it?

   I did. I’m a huge fan of the book and I know that you are too, and my
   first question is, how do you distinguish between moments of this movie
   that need to be adapted directly and areas where you have the freedom
   to put your own touches on it?

   I identified what makes a good film experience or not, because it’s
   basically adapting to a different language. So we took the pieces of
   the story that actually can be translated and there’s a space for new
   events that basically turn the screws of tension a little more, and
   make all the events more consequential. So there was a big space for
   creating those events. When you read the book, all that section happens
   in a longer time, it’s not necessarily consequential even though
   there’s a clear goal. But it’s also interrupted by flashbacks that last
   for chapters and interludes from Mike, so when you translate it to a
   film experience, you basically make everything consequential, make
   those adjustments so it’s an escalation, and crank up the tension.
   That’s the criteria, basically.

   The creature designs seem to be an area where you can inject some of
   your own twisted imagery. For those aspects, are you trying to capture
   imagery that disturbs you personally?

   You couldn’t say it better. Yeah. Absolutely. It all comes from the
   inside. I have to design creatures that would scare me if I saw the for
   the first time.

   I think the bug with a baby’s head in the Jade of the Orient sequence
   is going to mess up some kids who see this movie a few years earlier
   than they should.

   I know, I know. The baby bug is not something that you see in the book.
   It’s like a weird hybrid of imagination that’s pretty cool and
   disturbing, because it’s a horrible blend. It taps a little bit into
   the fact that nobody had babies, so it’s something that’s wedged in
   there, a theme. None of them had babies. Why? Because they had to stay
   children to access the power of belief. So I tossed the baby face on
   the bug, and it’s so disturbing. It doesn’t really need an explanation,
   because Pennywise is trying to generate chaos and fear. So I kept the
   eyeball that I really liked from the book, but then there’s a bat wing
   (laughs), that doesn’t need further explanation because it’s so fucking
   creepy. And then the floating heads of the kids that are still singing
   this Chinese restaurant tune. It’s chaos more than anything.

   Tell me about the scene with Bill having his vision, seeing the origins
   of It. That stuff is pretty wild in the novel – how did you go about
   creating that scene visually?

   One of the events in the original book is this psychoactive trip the
   kids have when they go to the smoke house. But there wasn’t really a
   place in the first movie to put it, starting with the fact that the
   first movie was – well, we had budget limitations and wanted to make a
   contained movie. I wanted to put the smoke house in the first one, but
   I couldn’t do it. But because it’s an event that I think people really
   remember, that vision of It coming to Earth for the first time millions
   of years go, sort of in the shape of an asteroid crashing to Earth.

   So we managed to find a place for that, and the whole Ritual of Chud
   was, the function of it was giving Mike something to lie about. Because
   Mike ultimately wants to use the only weapon that the Losers Club has,
   which is the power of belief. These characters are not children
   anymore, so they don’t have that. They don’t have the imagination or
   the innocence to believe in things that don’t exist. So he lies to them
   (laughs), invokes this thing that is basically mythological, that
   apparently worked before in the past, but it’s bullshit. It’s something
   that actually never worked. But it doesn’t matter, because if you
   believe, it will work. The piece of information that Mike has from the
   first movie – many people don’t remember this, but when they’re
   confronting Pennywise and Bill is holding this stun bolt gun that isn’t
   loaded, and all the kids think there’s a load there, and the only one
   that doesn’t is Mike. He’s like, ‘It’s unloaded, it’s unloaded!’ and
   all the kids are like, ‘Kill it, kill it, kill it!’ When Bill fires,
   they draw a big hole on Pennywise’s face. That was an indication for
   Mike that the power of unified belief is a weapon. After years and
   years of doing research, he comes to a dead end, he notices that
   there’s nothing…except for the element, which is belief. Pennywise uses
   that as a weapon, because he makes kids believe. But the truth is, it’s
   a weapon that can be turned against him.

   The Adrian Mellon scene is one of the most vicious things in the entire
   movie, and while a lot of the film’s violence is heightened, the
   violence inflicted on him is sadly something that still happens
   regularly in real life. I’ve heard you say that that’s why it was
   important to include, but were you ever concerned with the idea of
   portraying that realistic type of violence?

   No, I think it had to be realistic to show that the brutality of It is
   something that comes from human perversion, from human cruelty, and I
   didn’t want to hold back on that. Even Stephen King, when he included
   this in his story, it’s because it happened in his town. The murder of
   Charlie Howard in 1984. He was already making a story about the cruelty
   of humans in a small American town. It was very important for him, and
   very important for me, also. I think it’s relevant to a time when these
   things are still happening, you know?

   Yes. One of the things that is so present throughout the novel and the
   first movie is how the town of Derry has a sickness, almost like an
   infection because of It’s presence. Aside from the Adrian sequence,
   that element of the story doesn’t really come into play very much in
   Chapter Two. Were there additional scenes you shot that continued that
   thread for this movie?

   Of adults being evil?

   Yeah, and the town itself.

   Well, it’s established in the first one. I had a movie that was four
   hours, my first cut, so I had to basically lift some things that were
   secondary to the main plot. I think people that have the first movie
   fresh, they already have a feeling of how adults are. In fact, in the
   second movie you can still feel – you go back to a flashback with
   Beverly where we see her dad and his twisted way in which he abuses
   her. We learn a little more about it. We know where that comes from,
   spraying perfume on her, trying to recreate his dead wife.

   You mentioned your first cut was four hours. Was that just an assembly
   cut, or was that actually something that you would have been happy with
   audiences watching?

   No, no, not at all. That was an editorial cut, which is the thing you
   see when you finish shooting. So as you’re shooting, your editor is
   sort of assembling the movie with all the things that you shot,
   basically, all the scenes unaltered. That was four hours. After that, I
   started my director’s cut, which was three hours and twenty-five
   minutes. It’s tighter, I had the scenes the way I wanted them. But
   then, of course, 3:25, even though we did a test screening with that
   version that had a surprisingly high score, which is 82, that’s
   definitely a tribute to the audience’s love for the first one. But
   there were opportunities there to trim it, to refine it into a better
   film experience for the audience. And that’s what we did.

   There have been lots of stories about a potential supercut, and while I
   know that hasn’t been confirmed yet, could you tell me about some of
   the new material you would want to include if that ends up happening?

   Well, I can’t talk about it because I want to keep it under wraps a
   little bit. But one of them is something from the book, and the other
   is a thing that is new. It’s related to a resolution of the
   perpetrators of Adrian Mellon’s beating.

   Oh, OK. I was wondering about that.

   Bringing some justice.

   If you had your way, would that supercut version be something people
   could watch in a theater, or would that be designed specifically for a
   home video release?

   It feels more like a home video release. People won’t sit in a cinema
   for more than three hours, but on the other hand, they would binge
   [things] in their home for hours. I really don’t know what form it will
   have on home video, whether you buy it as six episodes, or what. It’s
   the same. At the end, it’s the same, because people that want to keep
   going, they will keep going. But it’s definitely, without shooting
   another movie, it’s a definitive, global edition of the whole story, so
   that’s why I wanted to include a couple of scenes that were not shot.
   Sort of like what Spielberg did with, not that it was two parts, but
   the special edition of Close Encounters. They released it, he shot
   more, then they rereleased it, and people poured to the cinema to see
   what that extra footage was.

   I want to ask you about It: Chapter Two specifically. What is the
   element that you are most proud of when you look back on the making of
   this movie?

   I think apart from the new spectacle that Chapter Two brings compared
   to the first one, the scope, scale, bigger canvas, I’m proud of the
   emotional journey. I’m proud of the emotional conclusion to this story,
   probably because it’s the thing that still gets me when I see the movie
   after watching it like 200 times. I still see the things that get me,
   like Richie holding Eddie in the cavern, the guys in the quarry, in the
   water at the end holding each other as a group. These bits still get
   me, and I think they work because it was well built throughout the two
   movies. I think there was an emotional engagement that was achieved. I
   see it in people, I see people coming out of the theater with teary
   eyes, and that’s the greatest reward.

   There was a report earlier this summer that you were in talks to direct
   The Flash. I don’t even want to get into the specifics of that with
   you, but I just want to ask hypothetically speaking, what would you
   like to see in a Flash movie?

   Well, I would be revealing too much, maybe. (laughs) I can’t talk about
   it yet, because we’re still in the beginning phase of that. But it’s
   very exciting. That I can tell you.

   *****

   It: Chapter Two is in theaters now.

‘Pelican Blood’ Review: A Powerful Portrait of Sacrifice and Motherhood
[Fantastic Fest 2019]

   Posted on Thursday, October 3rd, 2019 by Marisa Mirabal

   One of the defining traits of a mother is her unconditional love. No
   matter how rotten a child can be, a mother’s love can be undying and
   never waiver through troubled waters. It is both a blessing and a curse
   – this endless devotion and sacrifice that comes with being a parent.
   But just how far does that love go? How much can one parent give and
   risk in order to help a child that is seemingly hopeless?

   In her sophomore feature Pelican Blood, writer/director Katrin Gebbe
   captures the immense dedication that mothers can exude despite the most
   defiant and dangerous kids they try to nurture and protect.

‘Zombi Child’ Review: A Chilling and Wholly Unique Take on the Walking Dead
[NYFF 2019]

   Posted on Thursday, October 3rd, 2019 by Caroline Cao

   Zombi Child Review

   A pufferfish is sliced. Poison is stashed into a shoe. An unwitting
   victim (Mackenson Bijou) puts on that shoe and walks the street of 1962
   Haiti. Then he falls dead. He is buried. The corpse appears to hear the
   beat of dirt shoving on his casket. Inexplicably, the scene cuts to the
   walking corpse being dragged to a sugarcane farm. Now a “zombi,” he is
   forced into slavery with others like him. As automation with head
   bowed, the zombi slaves have no will to break from orders. Until one
   day, when the zombi breaks from slave labor and watches his
   civilization from the distance.

   This tale is lifted from the strange case of Clairvius Narcisse, a
   real-life documented “zombi”, a man who was buried alive before he
   returned to his society. (His tale also inspired Wes Craven’s The
   Serpent and the Rainbow). “Zombi” is the Haitian-French original
   spelling of the widely-known “Zombie.” And the “Zombi” of Zombi Child
   isn’t your conventional Hollywood walking dead. While Clairvius moans,
   elicit glassy stares, and gaits with bodily convulsions, Clairvius’s
   zombi form bears flesh that looks healthy on the outside rather than
   visibly torn. But his pain is inward, a starving for release from an
   ache he cannot articulate even when he finds the will to depart from
   the grueling labor.

‘Wrinkles the Clown’ Director Michael Beach Nichols on Internet Urban Legends
and Why We’re Afraid of Clowns [Interview]

   Posted on Thursday, October 3rd, 2019 by Rafael Motamayor

   Wrinkles the Clown Trailer

   Right in-between Pennywise the Dancing Clown and Joaquin Phoenix’ Clown
   Prince of Crime, a different type of clown wants to make it to the big
   screen – Wrinkles the Clown. Director Michael Beach Nichols takes a
   hard look at one of the most fascinating Internet legends of the past
   few years, a clown that is apparently hired by parents to scare their
   kids. As Marisa Mirabal wrote for the site, Wrinkles the Clown is an
   intriguing magic trick of a film, and it’s true, Nichols takes a simple
   premise – investigating the story behind a viral 2014 YouTube video
   that showed a sinister clown mask-wearing individual emerging from
   underneath a child’s bed – and evolves it into an exploration of the
   internet itself and its ability to spread wild tales and why we love to
   feel scared.

   I had the opportunity to interview the man behind the documentary,
   director Michael Beach Nichols, at Fantastic Fest and talk about the
   film, its big twist, the internet and more. For clarity and
   spoilers-sake, the interview has been edited so as to not ruin the
   surprise, and believe me – you’ll want to experience the insanity that
   is Wrinkles The Clown yourself when it arrives on October 4, 2019.

‘His Dark Materials’ Thickens the Plot in the Exposition-Heavy “The Spies”

   Posted on Monday, November 18th, 2019 by Hoai-Tran Bui

   his dark materials the spies review

   It took long enough, but it finally feels like we’ve gotten to the plot
   of His Dark Materials. It was partly on the fault of the series, for
   taking the Game of Thrones approach that unwisely split up our
   disparate storylines to give the impression of an epic, sprawling saga.

   But for the first time, His Dark Materials feels focused toward an end
   goal that unites our two biggest groups of characters: Lyra and the
   Gyptians. It was a major misstep to separate these two storylines in
   the first place – the familiarity with which Lyra greets the Gyptians
   in the third episode of His Dark Materials, “The Spies,” feels out of
   step with the cushy isolation that she existed in before. But now that
   Lyra and the Gyptians’ storylines are united, His Dark Materials
   finally feels like it’s settling into itself.

J.J. Abrams Says ‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ Didn’t Have to Change
Leia’s Story Due to Carrie Fisher’s Death

   Posted on Monday, November 18th, 2019 by Ethan Anderton

   Carrie Fisher in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker

   With just one month to go until Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker hits
   theaters, the publicity blitz for the final chapter of the Skywalker
   saga is really heating up. Director J.J. Abrams and the key cast
   members have been featured in various interviews across the web, and
   little details of what fans can expect from the end of the primary Star
   Wars saga have been coming to the surface.

   Unfortunately, the late Carrie Fisher can’t be part of these
   proceedings. The Star Wars legend has been said to get sent off in “a
   really beautiful way,” and if J.J. Abrams is to be believed, the
   passing of Carrie Fisher didn’t have an impact on the story they would
   have crafted for General Leia Organa. That’s interesting, because it
   appears to be in direct opposition to what Colin Trevorrow said when he
   was still attached to direct the sequel. Read More »

Marvel’s ‘Runaways’ Season 3 Trailer Gives a New Look at the Show’s Final
Season

   Posted on Monday, November 18th, 2019 by Ben Pearson

   Runaways season 3 trailer

   Runaways, the teen-centric superhero series that’s been chugging along
   on Hulu since 2017, is coming to an end – but there are still ten new
   episodes left. Hulu just dropped the trailer for the show’s upcoming
   third and final season, and while much of it looks pretty dour, at
   least Elizabeth Hurley seems to be having an absolute blast playing the
   evil sorceress Morgan le Fay. Read More »

‘Roma’ Becomes the First Netflix Film to Join the Criterion Collection

   Posted on Monday, November 18th, 2019 by Chris Evangelista

   Roma Blu-ray

   While a few original Netflix shows have received Blu-ray releases,
   Netflix movies tend not to get the same treatment. But that’s about to
   change – in a big way. Roma, the Netflix movie that scored several
   Oscar nominations and took home Best Foreign Language Film, is getting
   a Blu-ray release – and not just any old Blu-ray release, either. We’re
   talking The Criterion Collection here, which is about as fancy as you
   can get in the Blu-ray world.

With the Removal of a Historic Court Ruling, the Movie Landscape as We Know
It Might Change Forever

   Posted on Monday, November 18th, 2019 by Ben Pearson

   paramount consent decrees

   According to the Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is moving
   to completely wipe out the Paramount consent decrees, a ruling which,
   for the past 70 years, has regulated how movie studios distribute films
   to movie theaters. If those decrees are indeed overturned (and it looks
   like they will be), it could have devastating consequences to the
   theater industry as we know it, and the entire movie landscape could
   shift as a result. Here’s what this means in practical terms.

‘Waves’ Director Trey Edward Shults and His Cast on Their Brutal, Brilliant
New Drama [Interview]

   Posted on Monday, November 18th, 2019 by Steven Prokopy

   waves trailer new

   For his third feature in a row, writer/director Trey Edward Shults
   (Krisha, It Comes at Night) dives back into the subject of a family in
   crisis with Waves. This time around, he sets his drama in South Florida
   to trace the epic emotional journey of a suburban African-American
   family, led by Ronald (Sterling K. Brown), a well-intentioned father
   who puts a great deal of pressure on his high school athlete son Tyler
   (Kelvin Harrison Jr., from Luce, last year’s Monsters and Men, and
   Shults’ It Comes At Night), while tending to ignore his quiet, studious
   daughter Emily (newcomer Taylor Russell).

   When tragedy strikes, the family—who also includes stepmom Catharine
   (Renée Elise Goldsberry)—has to find the strength to regroup and
   forgive flaws even in the darkest times they have every faced. Emily is
   able to find some kind of solace with the help of a new boyfriend Luke
   (Lucas Hedges). Waves is a sometimes uncomfortably real and emotionally
   raw experience, in which all of the characters find very different
   paths through suffering and recovery, but it’s the journey that Shults
   paves for his characters that makes the film such a worthy and
   fulfilling experience.

   /Film spoke with Shults, Harrison, and Russell in Chicago recently
   during the Chicago International Film Festival, where they discussed
   the very personal events that led to the screenplay, and the ways in
   which the actors found their way into their very different characters,
   and the way Shults represented each with unique visual languages. Waves
   is currently in limited release, opening in top markets on November 22,
   and continuing to rollout throughout the holiday season.
