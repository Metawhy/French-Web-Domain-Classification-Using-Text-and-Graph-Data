A smarter way to
store everything you want.

One home for all your stuff

   Upthere Home, the first app for Upthere, is designed to be the one home
   for all of your photos, videos, music, and documents. Everything is
   safely and privately stored directly in the Upthere cloud, so you’re
   not limited by the space on your phone or computer. Learn more about
   our technology.

Anytime, anywhere

   Upthere Home is made for your multi-device life. Access and share the
   files you need, when and where you need them, in their original
   quality.

Find anything instantly

   Storing your stuff is important but you also need to quickly access
   it. Upthere gives you the tools to find exactly what you need, when you
   need it.

Search the way you think

   Upthere auto-categorizes your stuff by photos, videos, music, and
   documents. Super fast search makes it all searchable by time, location,
   or type.

Stay in the Loop

   When you need to manually organize your stuff, make a Loop. Loops are a
   quick and intuitive way to keep things together.

Sharing made easy

   Upthere is the easiest way to privately share anything with friends and
   family, no matter what device they use. Share any mix of files, no
   matter how many or how large. Everything is always shared in its full,
   original quality.

A private place

   Create privately shared Loops for trips, celebrations, or whatever
   works for you. Just choose some stuff, pick some people, and everyone
   can start sharing!

A living place

   Shared Loops are ongoing relationships. Anyone can invite people, add
   content, and comment.
