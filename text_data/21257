Sport Touring diagonal motorbike tyres

   Race bikers need a tyre that offers the highest level of safety – even
   if they ride with high speeds. Then a sport touring diagonal motorbike
   tyre is needed to offer them maximum adherence even on wet roads, and
   maintain the motorbike stable when turning. Despite this extreme
   exposure, bikers expect the tyres to have a long life. Well-known tyre
   producers like Michelin or Pirelli know the demands of their customers
   and offer appropiate sport touring diagonal motorbike tyres - diagonal
   tyres are still available, even if, radial tyres have a better speed
   performance and are preferred by most bikers.

What are diagonal tyres?

   Especially elderly bikers still use this type of tyres, while modern
   bikes are usually fitted with radial tyres. The steel wires of the
   casing's layers on diagonal tyres are crossed obliquely - for race
   motorbike tyres the angle is also narrower. The sport touring diagonal
   motorbike tyres have specific dimensions , e.g. 6.40-15. 6.40 is the
   tyre's width in inches, 15 is for the tyres's diameter in inches. On
   eiretyres.com you will find diagonal motorbike tyres in different
   dimensions.

Sport Touring Radial Motorcycle Tires

   Tour tires are motorcycle tires, which are long lasting in spite of
   sporty driving. This is a big challenge because normally when the tires
   are highly stressed, for example by rapid stops over and over again,
   they wear off quickly. But few motorcyclists refuse to fully utilize
   the capabilities of their machine. So they choose Sport Touring
   Motorcycle Tires - Radial tires are so popular, that their durability
   is higher than that of conventional Diagonal tires. The wet grip and
   cornering ability are better - qualities that are a good buying
   criteria for the Tour athletes. Therefore eiretyres.com offers a wide
   range of sport touring radial motorcycle tires.

What are radial tires?

   The steel cord filaments of the tires carcass plies are radially
   arranged. The cords are laid in Direction of the Tyre’s movement in the
   right Wimkel in the carcass. Directly under the tread of the radial
   motorcycle tire is a stable layer that leads around like a belt, which
   is why they are also called Belt tires called. They are now used in
   most motorcycles and cars.

Goodyear tyres – impressive quality for your car

   The brand Goodyear doesn’t need much introduction. It’s one of the
   household names in the automotive industry. It was founded by Frank
   Seiberling in 1898. It has manufactured tyres for motorcycles,
   automobiles, SUVs, airplanes, race cars and trucks. If you’re not
   familiar with the Goodyear brand, you may be familiar with Charles
   Goodyear, the man who invented vulcanised rubber and revolutionised the
   industry. Goodyear tyres can be found all over the world, and they are
   among the most qualitative ones.

Goodyear tyres – smooth ride all year round

   Goodyear tyres can be found nearly anywhere on the globe. The Goodyear
   logo is instantly recognisable, proof that it has done an excellent job
   throughout the years. These tyres are made in concordance with the
   highest criteria of quality and performance. They have proved to
   improve fuel efficiency, and the adherence on slippery roads and to
   decrease the external noise. There are no less than 15 criteria of
   performance and 50 tests that a tyre is subjected to before it is
   released on the market, a clear sign that Goodyear doesn’t make any
   compromises.
   Instead of purchasing faulty tyres that may have never been inspected
   in the first place, rely on Goodyear ones. You’ll be 100% sure that
   you’re completely safe and your car will run smoothly without any
   problems whatsoever. Search for Goodyear tyres on eiretyres.com and
   choose the products that are the most suitable for your vehicle.
