Modern Kitchen Project

   We recently updated a kitchen. To keep the cost down, we are leaving
   the countertop and appliances as is. We replaced the flooring, added a
   backsplash and painted the cabinets white. This is what the kitchen
   looked like before...

New JCP Home

   I got a chance to pop in to the new and improved JCP home to check out
   the collaboration they made with Jonathan Adler, Martha Stewart and
   Michael Graves. They are not completely done. But most of the products
   seen online are now available at the store. I took these pictures with
   my blackberry phone. Plus the lighting in the store are not very good.
   So the pictures don't do the justice. They look better in person.

Laura's Telephone Chair

   Laura just recently shared a before and after picture of a telephone
   chair she restored using SS Mum fabric and this is what she said,
   "I purchased a piece of your mum fabric over the summer and just wanted
   to share the finished product.  It's a family piece; vintage telephone
   table that has been refinished due to cigarette smoke in the wood and a
   need for new reupholstering.  Your fabric added the perfect touch.
   thanks so much! And I love that you are sustainable!"

Jim Thompson Fabric

   My sis-in-law gave me this beautiful Jim Thompson silk butterfly pillow
   cover over the holiday and Mila claimed it right away. "For my room!"
   she said. It goes very well with her new bedding and SS Raindrops
   pillow.

   Jim Thomspon produces the most beautiful silk and fabric. Do you know
   he also carry children's clothing line? Their fabric is very soft. The
   prints are super fun and colorful. Their elephant print is their
   signature. I was hoping they are available in the US.

Love and Thanks

   I was browsing through the two & from: Valentine edition this morning
   and came across this print from SS Print Shop.
   [300.jpg]
   I really like her version of the Love print. I was hoping it comes in
   different colors. These are my favorites too.

Mila's Abstract Art

   While most young girls like pink and purple, Mila's favorite color is
   Green! She has been asking to repaint her room green or replacing the
   headboard green or how about just the button on the headboard. Well, I
   told her that we can add green colors to her room in form of artworks
   and objects for her built-ins. So I have been saving these finger
   painting arts she did a while back and I got a chance to purchase these
   green Ikea frames over the weekend. She helped me putting them up and
   to see that huge smile on her face afterwards....is priceless.

Featured Designer: Lee Broom

   When I look at this London based designer, Lee Broom's product designs,
   they remind me of Jaime Hayon's, my all time favorite designer. With
   his background in Fashion, his design is edgy and unique. These are my
   favorites...
