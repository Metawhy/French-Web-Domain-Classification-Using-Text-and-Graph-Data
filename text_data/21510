Media Matrix Completes Museum Installations in Oklahoma and Oregon with
Alcorn McBride Technology

   Media Matrix Completes Museum Installations in Oklahoma and Oregon with
   Alcorn McBride Technology

   Orlando, FL, USA — Media Matrix has completed two new museum
   installations with the support of audio and video equipment from Alcorn
   McBride.  The company tapped Alcorn McBride’s DVM8500 Digital Video
   Machine for the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma Capitol Museum and both a
   DVM8500 and AM4  (Professional Digital Audio Player) for the US Bureau
   of Land Management’s (BLM) Nature Center in Southern Oregon.

   “Alcorn McBride is my go to company for audio and video delivery,” says
   Vinnie Cavarra, owner of Media Matrix in Coos Bay.  “Their products are
   top notch and the people couldn’t be better to work with.”

   Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma Capitol Museum

   The new “Choctaw Basketry Exhibit” was designed and built by Ko-Kwow
   LLC, a Coos Bay, Oregon exhibit design/build company.  It examines the
   tribe’s renowned basket weaving skills, which have been passed down
   from generation to generation.

   Cavarra served as the exhibit’s media consultant and installer. The
   exhibits are fully constructed at the Coos Bay/North Bend Ko-Kwow
   facilities, disassembled, then reassembled on site in Tuskahoma, where
   the museum is located.  Cavarra selected Alcorn’s DVM8500 to play back
   a short film on basket weaving.  The film is activated when visitors
   press a button; a screensaver is displayed at other times.

   In 2013, Cavarra had deployed an Alcorn McBride DVM8500 for the
   Museum’s exhibit on the Choctaw Codetalkers of World War I. “For the
   basketry exhibit, I again chose the Digital Video Machine because of
   its reliability and ease of operation,” says Cavarra.  “It’s a turnkey
   system for the client: No maintenance is required – it just works!”

   Exhibits at New River Visitor Center

   US Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Nature Center

   The BLM’s Nature Center is the visitors’ center at the New River Area
   of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), located in the Coos Bay
   District of Southern Oregon.  The area is dedicated almost entirely to
   watchable wildlife with short, rustic, self-guided loop trails through
   the New River estuary.  The Nature Center offers an exhibit with a
   virtual walk-through of the flora and fauna indigenous to the area.

   The exhibit features a large mural with a screen in the center that
   plays a 10-minute looped slide show accompanied by natural sounds
   reflecting the changing seasons.  Cavarra chose a DVM8500 to play back
   the video content. The mural also features a series of buttons that
   visitors can press to listen to an animal soundtrack, which is
   generated by an AM4 digital audio player.

   Another station in the exhibit uses an AM4 to play back oral histories
   of the original landowners. Among the original landowners were Nancy
   and Ann Wilson of the band Heart, who had donated their property to the
   BLM to safeguard the New River estuary for future generations.

   Design development and fabrication of the BLM exhibit was also by
   Ko-Kwow.

   “Alcorn McBride is a company that truly partners with me on these
   projects,” concludes Cavarra.  “Director of Sales, Scott Harkless is
   very supportive, and Product Manager, Mike Polder is great with
   technical solutions. They’re great people, very willing and available
   to help with set up and trouble-shooting.  They’re absolutely
   phenomenal to work with.”

VIDEO AND ARTWORK: Avatar Theme Park Concept Art Revealed at D23 Japan

   Oct 14, 2013 Joe Kleiman News, Theme Parks, Uncategorized Comments Off
   on VIDEO AND ARTWORK: Avatar Theme Park Concept Art Revealed at D23
   Japan
     __________________________________________________________________

   AVATAR-Inspired Land Coming to Disney’s Animal Kingdom

   Tokyo, Japan — On Saturday, October 12, 2013, Walt Disney Parks and
   Resorts Chairman Tom Staggs introduced original concept art for the new
   “Pandora” land to be constructed at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park
   at Florida’s Walt Disney World Resort.  What follows is the text of
   Stagg’s post on the Disney Parks Blog, the artwork as presented in high
   resolution to InPark Magazine by Walt Disney World, and a video of
   Avatar director James Cameron and Walt Disney Imagineering’s Joe Rohde
   introducing the new land to attendees at Japan’s first D23 convention.
    Click on the pictures for a larger image.

   From the moment AVATAR was released, people were captivated by the
   mythical world of Pandora. When we announced that we’d be working with
   James Cameron and Lightstorm Entertainment to bring this world to life
   in our parks, we felt certain that this partnership and combination of
   talent and imagination would produce an experience unlike any other
   ever created.

   AVATAR-Inspired Land Coming to Disney’s Animal Kingdom

   Our combined team has taken huge steps forward in “imagineering”
   Pandora as a real place for our guests to see, hear and touch. At the
   first-ever D23 Expo in Japan, we shared an early glimpse of the plans
   for AVATAR at Disney’s Animal Kingdom park and I wanted to share some
   of these breathtaking images and a short preview of what’s to come with
   all of you.

   AVATAR-Inspired Land Coming to Disney’s Animal Kingdom

   As these concept renderings show in epic scale, in the world of AVATAR
   guests will encounter awe-inspiring floating mountains and wander
   through a nighttime jungle of bioluminescent plants that are alive with
   light and sound. Guests will also discover what it feels like to soar
   into the sky riding a Banshee.

   And the new AVATAR-inspired land won’t be the only change coming to
   Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

   DisneyÕs Animal Kingdom Theme Park Expands

   As part of the largest expansion in the history of the park, we’ll be
   adding all-new entertainment experiences, including a new nighttime
   spectacular where live music, floating lanterns, water screens and
   swirling animal imagery all combine to bring a show to Discovery River
   that will delight our guests and truly cap off their day at Disney’s
   Animal Kingdom. The park will introduce more nighttime entertainment as
   well, including live performers on Discovery Island (pictured above)
   and a new nighttime version of the Kilimanjaro Safaris.

   Shaping a Future Land at DisneyÕs Animal Kingdom

   As the world of AVATAR becomes real at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, the
   energy and passion shared by our Imagineers and the Lightstorm team for
   this monumental task continues to be remarkable. I can’t wait to see
   the reactions of our guests as they step into a world that until now
   has only existed on the screen.
