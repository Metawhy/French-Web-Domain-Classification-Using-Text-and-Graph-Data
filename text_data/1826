     History books sometime call it The Longest Day, while some simply
     refer to it by a general operation term ’D-Day’ but Operation
     Overlord was the turning of the tide for the European war in the
     West.

     Overlord might be the greatest battle, with all things considered,
     in the history of the modern world. Everyone knew it was coming.
     According to a joke of the time, the sheer concrete evidence of the
     impending invasion weighed so heavily on the British Isles that it
     should have sunk into the sea, if only they had not been held up by
     masses of barrage balloons.

     In hundreds of hedge-bordered English fields, by late spring, were
     parks of camouflaged tanks, trucks, bulldozers, ducks, jeeps and
     self-propelled guns. Dozens of airfields were jammed to the fences
     with planes lined up beside the runways–more than 10,000 aircraft in
     all. Dozens of ports large and small were jammed with shipping–well
     over 5000 ships and landing crafts, including six battleships,
     twenty-two cruisers, and hundreds of destroyers, gunboats, corvettes
     and other fire-support crafts of what would become known as the
     Matchbox Fleet. More than 1 million troops especially trained for
     Overlord, half of them American and a half a mix of British or
     Canadian, organized in thirty-seven divisions for the amphibious
     assault.

     It was an unprecedented concentration of power, and those who
     witnessed it happening believed it to be a manifestation of what
     would be by far the most complicated plan ever made for a single
     operation of war. And it was.

     The invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 proved to be a complete
     tactical surprise. Rommel, the Allies soon learned after gaining
     control of the beaches, had not even been in France during the
     beginning of the twenty-four hours he had said would be decisive for
     the war. On the assumption that the predicted weather would make a
     cross-Channel operation impossible, he had returned to Germany on 4
     June for his wife’s birthday and to confer with Hitler. He did not
     arrive back to his HQ until six o'clock that evening of D-Day.

     Some 156,000 Allied troops had established themselves on nearly
     eighty square miles of Normandy soil at a casualty cost of around
     11,000; and Allies dominance (or rather, supremacy) of the skies,
     immediate shipping capacity, and prepared build up made it unlikely
     that the Germans could push back the Overlord forces.

     The feel of the war had changed. It was the Allies who were
     continually making gains, in both Europe and the Pacific, and the
     Axis who were suffering catastrophic losses.

   The Holocaust’s Death Rate Has Been Underestimated, Study Finds

     The Nazi Holocaust killed almost 1.5 million Jews in just three
     months in 1942, according to a study of archival German railroad
     records. That’s an even higher death rate than previously suspected
     for the largest murder campaign of World War II.

     Some 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust by the Nazi regime
     and its collaborators during the war. Operation Reinhard, the
     deadliest murder campaign in the racist genocide of these people,
     killed roughly 1.7 million Jews from 1942 to 1943, largely in three
     large death camps in western Poland.
