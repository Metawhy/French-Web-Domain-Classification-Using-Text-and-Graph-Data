Be an Artist-in-Residence

   Artists have created art in national parks since the late 19th century
   when famed Hudson River School painters captured the majestic views of
   our nation's western parks. Today, the sights and sounds in national
   parks continue to inspire artists in more than 50 residency programs
   across the country.
   Whether staying in a remote wilderness cabin at Denali National Park
   and Preserve in Alaska or contemplating history at Herbert Hoover
   National Historic Site in Iowa or working in a contemporary studio
   overlooking the stone-lined fields at Weir Farm National Historic Site
   in Connecticut, these programs provide artists with unique
   opportunities to create works of art in varied natural and cultural
   settings.
   There are programs for visual artists, writers, musicians, and other
   creative media. Programs vary, but residencies are typically 2 to 4
   weeks in length and most include lodging. Often artists are invited to
   participate in park programs by sharing their art with the public.

North Rim

North Rim Information On This Page Navigation


   Visitors at overlook on the left looking out across Grand Canyon at
   three temples. View of Deva, Brahma, and Zoroaster Temples as seen from
   Grand Canyon Lodge

The North Rim is Open for the Season, May 15th


   Visitors sitting on the veranda of the North Rim Lodge looking out at
   Grand Canyon On the patio of Grand Canyon Lodge

Introduction

   Lodging and restaurants are open May 15 through Oct. 15.

   A worthwhile trip for those who enjoy the road less traveled, the North
   Rim, or "other side" of Grand Canyon is visited by only 10% of all
   Grand Canyon visitors.
   - The North Rim is over 8000 feet/2438 m. in elevation
   - There is one lodge, Grand Canyon Lodge.
   - and one campground, operated by the NPS.
   Reservations for Lodging and the North Rim Campground are highly
   recommended.
   During winter months, the North Rim closes because of snow.

   Flight of stairs leads up to front entrance of rustic North Rim visitor
   center. The North Rim Visitor Center is adjacent to Grand Canyon Lodge
   The hike across the canyon from South Rim to North Rim is 21 miles (34
   km). However, driving from the South Rim to the North Rim by automobile
   requires a 4.5 hour drive of 220 miles (354 km). Driving directions to
   the North Rim.

   The North Rim Visitor Center, located adjacent to the parking lot for
   Grand Canyon Lodge and Bright Angel Point, provides park and regional
   information, maps, brochures, exhibits, and a bookstore.
   During the season, the Visitor Center is open May 15 through October 15
   from 8 am to 6 pm daily.
   Interpretive ranger programs are offered daily during the season.
   Public restrooms and outdoor exhibits are located behind the building.

   recedes into the distance; tiny people walking on trail. Left: main
   entrance to Grand Canyon Lodge. Right: walking the trail out to Bright
   Angel Point from the lodge.

Bright Angel Point

   For classic North Rim views, start at the Grand Canyon Lodge patio,
   then walk the paved trail out to Bright Angel Point.
   From the main parking area it is a relatively short, easy walk to Lodge
   itself. The lodge is wheelchair accessible.
   From the lodge the paved, 0.5 mile (0.8 km) round-trip trail leads out
   the spine of the ridge to Bright Angel Point. This trail is steep in
   places, with drop-offs and stairs, but provides dramatic views into
   Roaring Springs and Bright Angel Canyons.

North Rim Pocket Map and Services Guide

   In place of a newspaper, the North Rim Pocket Map and Services Guide is
   now being distributed at entrance stations, visitor centers, lodges,
   campgrounds, stores, and out-of-park locations. Download it here...

   Graphic shows front (listing of services) and back (maps) of North Rim
   Pocket Map - the PDF version is accessible. Front and back sides of the

   nearby formations. Right: A jagged narrow ridgeline leading down and to
   the right, then widening at the base of massive flat-topped Wotan's
   Throne. Left: view of Mt. Hayden from Point Imperial, highest overlook
   in the park at 8,803 feet (2,683 meters). Right: view from Cape Royal
   across to Wotan's Throne.

North Rim Scenic Drive

   Point Imperial and Cape Royal are reached via a winding scenic drive.
   The trip to both points, with short walks at each and several stops at
   pullouts along the way, can easily take half a day.

   Point Imperial, the highest point on the North Rim at 8,803 feet (2,683
   meters), overlooks the Painted Desert and the eastern end of Grand
   Canyon. Here the canyon transforms as the narrow walls of Marble
   Canyon, visible only as a winding gash, open dramatically to become
   "grand." Layers of red and black Precambrian rocks, not visible at
   Bright Angel Point, add contrast and color. Part of the viewpoint is
   accessible.

   Cape Royal provides a panorama up, down, and across the canyon. With
   seemingly unlimited vistas to the east and west, it is popular for both
   sunrise and sunset. The sweeping turn of the Colorado River at Unkar
   Delta is framed through the natural arch of Angels Window. Look for the
   Desert View Watchtower across the canyon on the South Rim. This popular
   viewpoint is accessible via a paved, level trail.
     __________________________________________________________________


Winter Camping with a Backcountry Permit

   North Rim roads are closed to vehicles between December 1st and May
   15th, and no visitor services are available. During these winter months
   backpackers, snowshoers, and cross-country skiers are permitted to use
   the North Rim Campground, provided a backcountry use permit has been
   obtained in advance. – These permits are available through the South
   Rim Backcountry Information Center. (e-mail us or call 928-638-7875)
   The closest place to park during this time is Jacob Lake. The hike
   through the snow from Jacob Lake to the North Rim Campground is around
   45 miles. Hikers, snowshoers, and cross-country skiers will need to
   remain off the closed road (per Superintendent's Compendium re: safety
   from snowplows) and forge a path through the snow.

     * Note about Snowmobiles: Snowmobiles are not permitted within the
       park.
     * Note about the Yurt: The North Rim yurt was removed because of
       safety issues and is no longer available.

   Duration:
          8 minutes, 21 seconds

   There is something about the North Rim of Grand Canyon that invokes a
   sense of solitude and serenity. This is a place that invites you to
   slow down, to ponder, to feel your own innate creativity, and to fall
   in love with landscape.

   An audio described version of this video is available here.
