New-old book from Andy Weir, illustrated by Sarah Andersen!
Cheshire Crossing Graphic Novel on Kindle, Audiobook or Paperback.

     #1 New York Times bestselling author Andy Weir and acclaimed
     illustrator Sarah Andersen tackle what transpires after “happily
     ever after.” What happens to Alice when she comes back from
     Wonderland? Wendy from Neverland? Dorothy from Oz?

     The three meet here, at Cheshire Crossing—a boarding school where
     girls like them learn how to cope with their supernatural
     experiences and harness their magical world-crossing powers.

     But the trio—now teenagers, who’ve had their fill of meddling
     authority figures—aren’t content to sit still in a classroom. Soon
     they’re dashing from one universe to the next, leaving havoc in
     their wake—and, inadvertently, bringing the Wicked Witch and Hook
     together in a deadly supervillain love match.

     To stop them, the girls will have to draw on all of their powers …
     and marshal a team of unlikely allies from across the magical
     multiverse.

     Written by the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Martian,
     Andy Weir, and illustrated by beloved Sarah’s Scribbles creator,
     Sarah Andersen, Cheshire Crossing is a funny, breakneck, boundlessly
     inventive journey through classic worlds as you’ve never seen them
     before.

The Martian review

     The Martian by Andy Weir

     Rating: ★★★★★

     I watched the movie a few years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I
     assumed I would enjoy the book just as much. And I was right! This
     book was absolutely incredible. I was on the edge of my seat the
     entire time.

     This is story of survival against all odds as Mark Watney, an
     astronaut on Mars, is left behind by his crew after a freak accident
     during their emergency departure leaves Mark injured and presumably
     dead. It’s only by sheer dumb luck that he survived (which became a
     theme throughout the book as well. While he’s clever, he also
     survives on luck as well as his own resourcefulness.)

     Right off the bat, we realize just how screwed Mark is. He himself
     realizes this as well. In fact, the very first line of the book
     is “I’m pretty much fucked.” It seems as everything is working
     against him, and Mark has nothing but his brain and the collection
     of equipment for a Mars mission to help him out of this impossible
     scenario. This book really nails home just how smart and versatile
     astronauts have to be in order to survive in space and on other
     planets.

     Mark is incredibly intelligent (obviously, if he was chosen to be an
     astronaut on a Mars mission), resourceful, creative, and hilarious.
     This book was primarily written in the style of Mark’s mission log
     book entries, and the author took full advantage of this. It could
     have easily become a very dull, dry account of everything, but
     instead, the author let Mark’s humor and wit shine through. Even
     though there were parts of the log book that were very
     science/math/tech-heavy, Mark almost always boiled it down into
     laymen’s terms so the reader could follow along easily enough.

     Mark’s smart-assery and humor kept this book from getting to dark,
     and it was a method he used to keep himself from despairing as he
     was trapped all by himself on a barren, desolate planet that is a
     perfect death-trap. He is such a charming character that you can’t
     help but root for him and fall utterly in love with him.

     This book was such a page turner. I stayed up much later than I
     should have to finish it, but it was totally worth it. On one hand,
     I didn’t want it to end because it was such an entertaining story.
     But on the other, I wanted it to end because that meant Mark was
     safely rescued and on his way home.

     This book is definitely one that I would enjoy rereading in the
     future and comes with my highest recommendation for anyone who is a
     fan of dark comedy and extremely realistic science fiction.

     ANDY WEIR built a career as a software engineer until the success of
     his first published novel, THE MARTIAN, allowed him to live out his
     dream of writing full time. He is a lifelong space nerd and a
     devoted hobbyist of subjects such as relativistic physics, orbital
     mechanics, and the history of manned spaceflight. He also mixes a
     mean cocktail. He lives in California. Moderated by Jason Gessner.

   Anonymous asked:

   Is your url a reference to the martian?
   [avatar_6e1b73557466_96.pnj]

   hes-a-steely-eyed-missile-man Answer:

   the fact that someone got the reference pleases me immensely!

   the martian is, of course, one of the greatest books/films to ever have
   been written so kudos to you for having the good taste to have
   seen/read it.

   i actually found out afterwards that ‘steely-eyed-missile-man’ is NASA
   slang term for an astronaut/engineer who comes up with a clever
   solution to a problem under a lot of pressure. apparently it originated
   with John Aaron in the ‘60s: he was on the Apollo 12 mission when it
   was struck by lightning barely 30 seconds after launch. all of the
   telemetry equipment started bugging out however he had seen a similar
   occurence before and advised houston (who had no idea tf he was talking
   about) on what to do, which flipped the readings back to normal again.
   the only reason he knew how to do so was that he had chased up an
   anomaly on telemetry readings on a test at Kennedy a year earlier of
   his own volition. it basically saved apollo 12 and since then he was
   referred to as a ‘steely-eyed-missile-man’.

   it gives a cool little backstory to rich purnell’s assigned nickname in
   the martian so i’d advise you to read the apollo 12 section of Aaron’s
   wikipedia article

   BRAND NEW paperback of the martian by andy weir - never read, in
   pristine condition - bundle to save!!! summary: Six days ago, astronaut
   Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s
   sure he’ll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly
   kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark
   finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal
   Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies
   would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. But Mark isn’t ready
   to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and
   a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one
   seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. #fiction #book #books

     Raven’s Reviews
     Time for another book off my top 10 list!
     The Martian by Andy Weir
     Category: Funniest

     This book puts the science back in science fiction. Astronaut Mark
     Watney is part of the first manned expedition to Mars. A massive
     storm forces the team to evacuate. During the evacuation Mark is
     clobbered by flying debris, leading his team to assume he is dead
     and abandon him on Mars.
     Mark faces the monumental task of communicating with earth and
     planning his own rescue, all while dealing with the harsh conditions
     of a literally alien environment.
     I love this book so much. One part survival story, one part science
     fiction, Andy Weir explores human endurance and ingenuity.Mark is a
     clever, hilariously sarcastic narrator who uses black humour to cope
     with his situation. Andy Weir worked with NASA and did the math for
     every scenario Mark goes through. That’s dedication.
