   A man broke into the offices of Valve Software in September, and did
   away with $40,000 worth equipment and game keys. He was caught on
   camera trying to sell these keys at a Game Stop store. 32-year-old
   Shawn Shaputis already had six warrants for his arrest out on him when
   he broke into the Bellevue WA offices of one of the world's largest
   game distribution companies. The suspect is still at large, and is
   summoned to appear before court. Should he fail to show up, additional
   warrants for arrest will be put out. Valve Software owns Steam, the
   world's largest online game distribution platform.

Blizzard Employees Protest Company's Blitzchung Ban

   Today, 08:14 Discuss (10 Comments)
   Blizzard employees protested the company's decision to ban Hearthstone
   player "Blitzchung" from an event for his opinions on the ongoing
   situation in Hong Kong SAR. Some employees covered up a portion of a
   floor decal in the company's office that read "Think Globally," and
   "Every Voice Matters," in protest. Blizzard's MMORPGs are "massively"
   popular in China, with Chinese Internet giant Tencent holding an equity
   stake. Some see the move to ban "Blitzchung" as the company "bending
   the knee" to China by taking a position on the situation in Hong Kong,
   instead of remaining neutral. The picture of a ruled piece of paper
   covering up the company floor decal with duct tape was tweeted by
   former Blizzard employee and eSports industry observer Kevin Hovdestad.

Micron Tapes Out 128-layer 3D NAND Flash Memory

   by

   Today, 07:59 Discuss (0 Comments)
   Micron Technology has taped out its 4th generation 3D NAND flash memory
   with 128 layers. This paves the way for mass production and product
   implementations in 2020. The 4th gen 3D NAND by Micron continues to use
   a CMOS-under-array design, but with Replacement Gate (RG) Technology
   instead of Floating Gate, which Micron and the erstwhile IMFlash
   Technology had been using for years. Micron is currently mass-producing
   96-layer 3D NAND flash, and TLC remains the prominent data-storage
   physical layer despite the advent of QLC (4 bits per cell).
   Micron comments that this 4th gen 128-layer 3D NAND will be a stopgap
   restricted to a select few applications, and may not see the kind of
   adoption as its current 96-layer chips. The company appears to be more
   focused on its evolution, possibly the 5th generation 3D NAND, which
   are expected to bring tangible cost-per-bit gains for the company, as
   it transitions to a newer silicon fabrication node, and implements even
   newer technologies besides RG. "We achieved our first yielding dies
   using replacement gate or "RG" for short. This milestone further
   reduces the risk for our RG transition. As a reminder, our first RG
   node will be 128 layers and will be used for a select set of products.
   We don't expect RG to deliver meaningful cost reductions until FY2021
   when our second-generation RG node is broadly deployed. Consequently,
   we are expecting minimal cost reductions in NAND in FY2020. Our RG
   production deployment approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND
   capital investments," said Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO and president of
   Micron.

AMD Launches Ryzen 9 3900 and Ryzen 5 3500X Processors

   by


    btarunr

   Today, 07:21 Discuss (6 Comments)
   AMD Tuesday expanded its 3rd generation Ryzen desktop processor lineup
   with two new product additions, the 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 3900, and
   the 6-core/12-thread Ryzen 5 3500X. Both chips are particularly
   interesting given their naming. The 3900 is a slightly subdued twin of
   the company's current flagship, the 3900X, with a small amount of clock
   speed traded off for a huge drop in TDP. This chip ticks at 3.10 GHz
   with 4.30 GHz boost, compared to 3.80/4.60 GHz frequencies of the
   3900X. Its TDP, however, is rated at just 65 W, compared to 105 W of
   the 3900X. You get 512 KB of dedicated L2 cache per core, and 64 MB of
   L3 cache.
   The Ryzen 5 3500X is another interesting part, in which the "X" makes a
   world of difference from the Ryzen 5 3500. Whilst the 3500 is a
   6-core/6-thread part devoid of SMT, the 3500X is 6-core/12-thread
   (features SMT), has the same exact 3.60 GHz nominal clocks as the
   popular Ryzen 5 3600, but a slightly lower 4.10 GHz boost frequency,
   compared to 4.20 GHz of the 3600. The Ryzen 5 3500X is expected to be
   marginally cheaper than the 3600, at around $189, and is currently only
   being offered to OEMs and system integrators in China. The company
   hasn't finalized pricing for the 3900, yet.

   The 650 W FSP Dagger Pro cannot compare to the SFX competition because
   its performance is not on par with the EVGA 650 GM, which is also based
   on an FSP platform and costs the same as the Dagger. As such, you

   In heartbreaking news to slayers prepping for the hotly anticipated
   addition to the franchise, DOOM Eternal, id Software announced that the
   game's release has been delayed to the 20th of March, 2020, from its
   earlier 22nd November 2019 release. In its announcement, id Software
   put quality-assurance as the main reason behind the delay. The
   developer assured gamers that the game will be worth the additional 5
   months of wait. id also announced a few updates, namely Invasion Mode,
   a gameplay mode that allows you to "invade" another player's game as a
   playable demon, a Nintendo Switch version that follows the other
   platforms, and the availability of DOOM 64 on Xbox One, PlayStation 4
   and PC.

   Yesterday, 17:57 Discuss (21 Comments)
   Noctua today introduced the long awaited all-black versions of its
   award-winning NH-D15, NH-U12S and NH-L9i CPU coolers. Staying true to
   the successful formula of the original models, the new chromax.black
   versions with their black fans and black coated heatsinks combine the
   same signature quiet cooling performance with a sleek stealth look. The
   NH-D15 chromax.black and NH-U12S chromax.black will initially be
   exclusively available in a Linus Tech Tips limited edition that
   includes extra orange anti-vibration pads and custom fan stickers.
   "Our customers have been asking us for all-black coolers for a long
   time, but we're soldering the fins to the heatpipes in order to
   guarantee optimal performance over many years of usage and this
   production process is difficult to combine with coatings," explains
   Roland Mossig (Noctua CEO). "It took a lot of time and engineering work
   to find an appropriate coating material and production process that
   gave us satisfactory thermal performance and consistent visual
   appearance. Now, we're proud with the end result and confident that the
   new chromax.black coolers will meet the high standards Noctua users
   have come to expect."

The End of a Collaboration: Intel Announces Discontinuation of Kaby Lake-G
with AMD Radeon Vega Graphics

   by


    Raevenlord

   Yesterday, 17:42 Discuss (11 Comments)
   The marriage of Intel and AMD IPs in the form of the Kaby Lake-G
   processors was met with both surprised grunts from the company and a
   sense of bewilderment at what could come next. Well, we now know what
   came next: Intel hiring several high-level AMD employees on the
   graphics space and putting together its own motley crew of discrete GPU
   developers, who should be putting out Intel's next-gen high-performance
   graphics accelerators sometime next year.
   The Kaby Lake-G processors, however, showed promise, pairing both
   Intel's (at the time) IPC dominance and AMD's graphics IP performance
   and expertise on a single package by placing the two components in the
   same substrate and connecting them via a PCIe link. A new and succinct
   Intel notice on the Kaby Lake-G page sets a last order time (January
   31, 2020, as the last date for orders, and July 31, 2020, as the date
   of last shipments), and explains that product market shifts have moved
   demand from Kaby Lake-G products "to other Intel products". Uptake was
   always slow on this particular collaboration - most of it, we'd guess,
   because of the chips' strange footprint arrangement for embedding in
   systems, which required custom solutions that had to be designed from
   scratch. And with Intel investing into their own high-performance
   graphics, it seems clear that there is just no need to flaunt their
   previous collaborations with other companies in this field. Farewell,
   Intel-AMD Kaby Lake-G. We barely knew you.

XFX Launches the Radeon RX 5700 XT THICC III Ultra

   Yesterday, 16:54 Discuss (22 Comments)
   XFX today finally launched their thick, custom version of the AMD
   Navi-powered RX 5700 XT. The new RX 5700 XT THICC III Ultra features a
   triple-slot (well, 2.7 slots, but who's counting but we?) cooling
   solution with three cooling fans, thus upping the ante compared to
   previous XFX THICC graphics cards. XFX boasts hat their THICC III Ultra
   features a peak Boost clock of 2025 MHz, and typical Boosts in the area
   of 1935 MHz (a 10.3% increase compared to AMD's reference specs).
   The THICC design philosophy stands the test of time here, with the card
   mainly being black colored, with some silver accents. A thick aluminium
   fin-stack fed by a copper baseplate and copper heat pipes ensure a
   constant heat transfer from the GPU chip to the fin-stack array, which
   now sees three fans working overtime to dissipate all that
   framerate-produced heat - fed by a pair of 8-pin connectors.

TechPowerUp GPU-Z v2.26.0 Released

   Yesterday, 15:34 Discuss (6 Comments)
   Today we released the latest version of TechPowerUp GPU-Z, the popular
   graphics subsystem information, monitoring, and diagnostic utility.
   Version 2.26.0 adds support for new GPUs, introduces new features, and
   fixes problems with existing ones. To begin with, support is added for
   AMD Radeon RX 5500 and RX 5500M, TU104-based NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060
   (non-Super), and Quadro P520. Fake detection has been added for various
   "Kepler" based GTX 10-series knockoffs.
   With this release we fixed an application crash during BIOS extraction
   on nearly all NVIDIA GPUs. Another crash that appears when the
   application is launched on machines with AMD "Navi" GPUs without
   drivers installed. The ASUS ROG skin has been fixed to properly show
   the "Close" button in the bottom. We also improved the memory junction
   temperature tooltip on AMD "Navi" to denote that the hottest chip's
   junction temperature is being reported, and not an average across all
   chips. Last version's AMD Navi fan-stop fix has been reverted since AMD
   fixed the issue since their 19.9.1 drivers. PCIe and CrossFire state
   detection has been fixed for AMD "Navi" and "Vega 20" based graphics
   cards. Grab it from the link below.

   this new products tries to introduce the concept of modular computing,
   where you can basically swap out parts and replace them with ease, to
   users of PCs who wanted this to happen for a long time.
   If anyone remembers Razer's project Christine, which unfortunately
   didn't take off, this product should be of no surprise to them. The
   Element is a complete PC consisting out of CPU, RAM and Storage, with a
   PCIe slot attached to it. Featuring plenty of IO options like
   Thunderbolt, HDMI, Ethernet, USB, and Wi-Fi, The Element is a complete
   solution for computing. For the demo Intel soldered a BGA Xeon CPU with
   room for two SODIMM slots for memory and two M.2 ports for storage
   expansion, all cooled by a blower fan directly cooling the CPU
   heatsink. Power is supplied from PCIe slot (75 Watts) and 8 pin
   connector which would come from a regular PSU. There is also an option
   for the card to be powered by a 19 V power source if external power

   Intel Monday revised prices of select 9th generation Core "Coffee Lake
   Refresh" desktop processor models. These price cuts target the "F" and
   "KF" brand extensions, which denote a lack of integrated graphics. The
   price cuts range from 5 percent to 20 percent, and cover key
   fast-moving SKUs popular with the DIY gaming PC crowd that likes to
   pair these chips with discrete graphics cards. The entry-level Core
   i3-9100F gets the biggest cut of the lot. The 4-core/4-thread chip is
   now selling for USD $97, a 20 percent cut from its $122 MSRP.
   Other noteworthy cuts include the popular Core i5-9400F 6-core/6-thread
   processor, which is now going for $157, compared to its $182 original
   price. This chip has seen sub-$160 pricing in promotional sales on
   popular e-tailers such as Newegg. The Core i7-9700F and i7-9700KF are
   the other popular SKUs among the premium gaming PC build crowd. The two
   8-core/8-thread chips are now priced at $298 and $349, respectively.
   Leading the pack is the Core i9-9900KF, which is going for $463, a
   small 5% saving over the i9-9900K which you can spend elsewhere, such
   as slightly faster RAM.

Intel Marketing Tries to Link Stability to Turbo Boost

   by


    btarunr

   Monday, 17:17 Discuss (28 Comments)
   There is no correlation between CPU frequency boosting behavior and
   system stability. Intel today launched its "10th generation" Core X
   HEDT processors, with core-counts ranging between 10 to 18, priced
   between $590 and $978. Based on the 14 nm "Cascade Lake-X" silicon,
   these chips have the same exact IPC as "Skylake" circa 2015, but offer
   nearly double the number of cores to the Dollar compared to the 9th
   generation Core X series; and add a couple of useful instruction sets
   such as DLBoost, which accelerates DNN training/building; a few more
   AVX-512 instructions, and an updated Turbo Boost Max 3.0 algorithm. The
   chips offer clock-speed bumps over the previous generation.
   Intel's main trade-call for these processors? Taking another stab at
   AMD for falling short on boost frequency in the hands of consumers.
   "The chip that hits frequency benchmarks as promised, our new #CoreX
   -series processor, provides a stable, high-performance platform for
   visual creators everywhere," reads the Intel tweet, as if to suggest
   that reaching the "promised" clock speed results in stability. AMD was
   confronted with alarming statistics of consumers whose 3rd generation
   Ryzen processors wouldn't reach their advertised boost frequencies. The
   company released an updated AGESA microcode that fixed this.

   Monday, 16:32 Discuss (7 Comments)
   Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a world leader in advanced semiconductor
   technology, today announced that it has developed the industry's first
   12-layer 3D-TSV (Through Silicon Via) technology. Samsung's new
   innovation is considered one of the most challenging packaging
   technologies for mass production of high-performance chips, as it
   requires pinpoint accuracy to vertically interconnect 12 DRAM chips
   through a three-dimensional configuration of more than 60,000 TSV
   holes, each of which is one-twentieth the thickness of a single strand
   of human hair.
   The thickness of the package (720 µm) remains the same as current
   8-layer High Bandwidth Memory-2 (HBM2) products, which is a substantial
   advancement in component design. This will help customers release
   next-generation, high-capacity products with higher performance
   capacity without having to change their system configuration designs.
   In addition, the 3D packaging technology also features a shorter data
   transmission time between chips than the currently existing wire
   bonding technology, resulting in significantly faster speed and lower
   power consumption.

AMD Zen 3 Could Bid the CCX Farewell, Feature Updated SMT

   Updated by


    btarunr

   Monday, 06:54 Updated: Monday, 08:22 Discuss (26 Comments)
   With its next-generation "Zen 3" CPU microarchitecture designed for the
   7 nm EUV silicon fabrication process, AMD could bid the "Zen" compute
   complex or CCX farewell, heralding chiplets with monolithic last-level
   caches (L3 caches) that are shared across all cores on the chiplet. AMD
   embraced a quad-core compute complex approach to building multi-core
   processors with "Zen." At the time, the 8-core "Zeppelin" die featured
   two CCX with four cores, each. With "Zen 2," AMD reduced the CPU
   chiplet to only containing CPU cores, L3 cache, and an Infinity Fabric
   interface, talking to an I/O controller die elsewhere on the processor
   package. This reduces the economic or technical utility in retaining
   the CCX topology, which limits the amount of L3 cache individual cores
   can access.
   This and more juicy details about "Zen 3" were put out by a leaked
   (later deleted) technical presentation by company CTO Mark Papermaster.
   On the EPYC side of things, AMD's design efforts will be spearheaded by
   the "Milan" multi-chip module, featuring up to 64 cores spread across
   eight 8-core chiplets. Papermaster talked about how the individual
   chiplets will feature "unified" 32 MB of last-level cache, which means
   a deprecation of the CCX topology. He also detailed an updated SMT
   implementation that doubles the number of logical processors per
   physical core. The I/O interface of "Milan" will retain PCI-Express gen
   4.0 and eight-channel DDR4 memory interface.

NVIDIA Could Launch Next-Generation Ampere GPUs in 1H 2020

   by


    AleksandarK

   Monday, 06:00 Discuss (30 Comments)
   According to the sources over at Igor's Lab, NVIDIA could launch its
   next generation of GPUs, codenamed "Ampere", as soon as first half of
   the 2020 arrives. Having just recently launched GeForce RTX Super
   lineup, NVIDIA could surprise us again in the coming months with
   replacement for it's Turing lineup of graphics cards. Expected to
   directly replace high-end GPU models that are currently present, like
   GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 2080 Super, Ampere should bring many
   performance and technology advancements a new graphics card generation
   is usually associated with.
   For starters, we could expect a notable die shrink to take place in
   form of 7 nm node, which will replace the aging 12 nm process that
   Turing is currently being built on. This alone should bring more than
   50% increase in transistor density, resulting in much more performance
   and lower power consumption compared to previous generation. NVIDIA's
   foundry of choice is still unknown, however current speculations are
   predicting that Samsung will manufacture Ampere, possibly due to
   delivery issues that are taking place at TSMC. Architectural
   improvements should take place as well. Ray tracing is expected to
   persist and get enhanced with possibly more hardware allocated for it,
   along with better software to support the ray tracing ecosystem of
   applications.

                Micron Tapes Out 128-layer 3D NAND Flash Memory

   Micron Technology has taped out its 4th generation 3D NAND flash memory
   with 128 layers. This paves the way for mass production and product
   implementations in 2020. The 4th gen 3D NAND by Micron continues to use
   a CMOS-under-array design, but with Replacement Gate (RG) Technology
   instead of Floating Gate, which Micron and the erstwhile IMFlash
   Technology had been using for years. Micron is currently mass-producing
   96-layer 3D NAND flash, and TLC remains the prominent data-storage
   physical layer despite the advent of QLC (4 bits per cell).
   Micron comments that this 4th gen 128-layer 3D NAND will be a stopgap
   restricted to a select few applications, and may not see the kind of
   adoption as its current 96-layer chips. The company appears to be more
   focused on its evolution, possibly the 5th generation 3D NAND, which
   are expected to bring tangible cost-per-bit gains for the company, as
   it transitions to a newer silicon fabrication node, and implements even
   newer technologies besides RG. "We achieved our first yielding dies
   using replacement gate or "RG" for short. This milestone further
   reduces the risk for our RG transition. As a reminder, our first RG
   node will be 128 layers and will be used for a select set of products.
   We don't expect RG to deliver meaningful cost reductions until FY2021
   when our second-generation RG node is broadly deployed. Consequently,
   we are expecting minimal cost reductions in NAND in FY2020. Our RG
   production deployment approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND
   capital investments," said Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO and president of
   Micron.

   AMD Tuesday expanded its 3rd generation Ryzen desktop processor lineup
   with two new product additions, the 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 3900, and
   the 6-core/12-thread Ryzen 5 3500X. Both chips are particularly
   interesting given their naming. The 3900 is a slightly subdued twin of
   the company's current flagship, the 3900X, with a small amount of clock
   speed traded off for a huge drop in TDP. This chip ticks at 3.10 GHz
   with 4.30 GHz boost, compared to 3.80/4.60 GHz frequencies of the
   3900X. Its TDP, however, is rated at just 65 W, compared to 105 W of
   the 3900X. You get 512 KB of dedicated L2 cache per core, and 64 MB of
   L3 cache.
   The Ryzen 5 3500X is another interesting part, in which the "X" makes a
   world of difference from the Ryzen 5 3500. Whilst the 3500 is a
   6-core/6-thread part devoid of SMT, the 3500X is 6-core/12-thread
   (features SMT), has the same exact 3.60 GHz nominal clocks as the
   popular Ryzen 5 3600, but a slightly lower 4.10 GHz boost frequency,
   compared to 4.20 GHz of the 3600. The Ryzen 5 3500X is expected to be
   marginally cheaper than the 3600, at around $189, and is currently only
   being offered to OEMs and system integrators in China. The company
   hasn't finalized pricing for the 3900, yet.

The End of a Collaboration: Intel Announces Discontinuation of Kaby Lake-G with

   The marriage of Intel and AMD IPs in the form of the Kaby Lake-G
   processors was met with both surprised grunts from the company and a
   sense of bewilderment at what could come next. Well, we now know what
   came next: Intel hiring several high-level AMD employees on the
   graphics space and putting together its own motley crew of discrete GPU
   developers, who should be putting out Intel's next-gen high-performance
   graphics accelerators sometime next year.
   The Kaby Lake-G processors, however, showed promise, pairing both
   Intel's (at the time) IPC dominance and AMD's graphics IP performance
   and expertise on a single package by placing the two components in the
   same substrate and connecting them via a PCIe link. A new and succinct
   Intel notice on the Kaby Lake-G page sets a last order time (January
   31, 2020, as the last date for orders, and July 31, 2020, as the date
   of last shipments), and explains that product market shifts have moved
   demand from Kaby Lake-G products "to other Intel products". Uptake was
   always slow on this particular collaboration - most of it, we'd guess,
   because of the chips' strange footprint arrangement for embedding in
   systems, which required custom solutions that had to be designed from
   scratch. And with Intel investing into their own high-performance
   graphics, it seems clear that there is just no need to flaunt their
   previous collaborations with other companies in this field. Farewell,
   Intel-AMD Kaby Lake-G. We barely knew you.

   The THICC design philosophy stands the test of time here, with the card
   mainly being black colored, with some silver accents. A thick aluminium
   fin-stack fed by a copper baseplate and copper heat pipes ensure a
   constant heat transfer from the GPU chip to the fin-stack array, which
   now sees three fans working overtime to dissipate all that
   framerate-produced heat - fed by a pair of 8-pin connectors.

   There is no correlation between CPU frequency boosting behavior and
   system stability. Intel today launched its "10th generation" Core X
   HEDT processors, with core-counts ranging between 10 to 18, priced
   between $590 and $978. Based on the 14 nm "Cascade Lake-X" silicon,
   these chips have the same exact IPC as "Skylake" circa 2015, but offer
   nearly double the number of cores to the Dollar compared to the 9th
   generation Core X series; and add a couple of useful instruction sets
   such as DLBoost, which accelerates DNN training/building; a few more
   AVX-512 instructions, and an updated Turbo Boost Max 3.0 algorithm. The
   chips offer clock-speed bumps over the previous generation.
   Intel's main trade-call for these processors? Taking another stab at
   AMD for falling short on boost frequency in the hands of consumers.
   "The chip that hits frequency benchmarks as promised, our new #CoreX
   -series processor, provides a stable, high-performance platform for
   visual creators everywhere," reads the Intel tweet, as if to suggest
   that reaching the "promised" clock speed results in stability. AMD was
   confronted with alarming statistics of consumers whose 3rd generation

           AMD Zen 3 Could Bid the CCX Farewell, Feature Updated SMT

   Updated by

   Monday, 06:54 Updated: Monday, 08:22 Discuss (26 Comments)

   With its next-generation "Zen 3" CPU microarchitecture designed for the
   7 nm EUV silicon fabrication process, AMD could bid the "Zen" compute
   complex or CCX farewell, heralding chiplets with monolithic last-level
   caches (L3 caches) that are shared across all cores on the chiplet. AMD
   embraced a quad-core compute complex approach to building multi-core
   processors with "Zen." At the time, the 8-core "Zeppelin" die featured
   two CCX with four cores, each. With "Zen 2," AMD reduced the CPU
   chiplet to only containing CPU cores, L3 cache, and an Infinity Fabric
   interface, talking to an I/O controller die elsewhere on the processor
   package. This reduces the economic or technical utility in retaining
   the CCX topology, which limits the amount of L3 cache individual cores
   can access.
   This and more juicy details about "Zen 3" were put out by a leaked
   (later deleted) technical presentation by company CTO Mark Papermaster.
   On the EPYC side of things, AMD's design efforts will be spearheaded by
   the "Milan" multi-chip module, featuring up to 64 cores spread across
   eight 8-core chiplets. Papermaster talked about how the individual
   chiplets will feature "unified" 32 MB of last-level cache, which means
   a deprecation of the CCX topology. He also detailed an updated SMT
   implementation that doubles the number of logical processors per
   physical core. The I/O interface of "Milan" will retain PCI-Express gen
   4.0 and eight-channel DDR4 memory interface.

   he broke into the Bellevue WA offices of one of the world's largest
   game distribution companies. The suspect is still at large, and is
   summoned to appear before court. Should he fail to show up, additional
   warrants for arrest will be put out. Valve Software owns Steam, the

   Blizzard employees protested the company's decision to ban Hearthstone
   player "Blitzchung" from an event for his opinions on the ongoing
   situation in Hong Kong SAR. Some employees covered up a portion of a
   floor decal in the company's office that read "Think Globally," and
   "Every Voice Matters," in protest. Blizzard's MMORPGs are "massively"
   popular in China, with Chinese Internet giant Tencent holding an equity
   stake. Some see the move to ban "Blitzchung" as the company "bending
   the knee" to China by taking a position on the situation in Hong Kong,
   instead of remaining neutral. The picture of a ruled piece of paper
   covering up the company floor decal with duct tape was tweeted by
   former Blizzard employee and eSports industry observer Kevin Hovdestad.

Micron Tapes Out 128-layer 3D NAND Flash Memory

   by

   Today, 07:59 Discuss (0 Comments)
   Micron Technology has taped out its 4th generation 3D NAND flash memory
   with 128 layers. This paves the way for mass production and product
   implementations in 2020. The 4th gen 3D NAND by Micron continues to use
   a CMOS-under-array design, but with Replacement Gate (RG) Technology
   instead of Floating Gate, which Micron and the erstwhile IMFlash
   Technology had been using for years. Micron is currently mass-producing
   96-layer 3D NAND flash, and TLC remains the prominent data-storage
   physical layer despite the advent of QLC (4 bits per cell).
   Micron comments that this 4th gen 128-layer 3D NAND will be a stopgap
   restricted to a select few applications, and may not see the kind of
   adoption as its current 96-layer chips. The company appears to be more
   focused on its evolution, possibly the 5th generation 3D NAND, which
   are expected to bring tangible cost-per-bit gains for the company, as
   it transitions to a newer silicon fabrication node, and implements even
   newer technologies besides RG. "We achieved our first yielding dies
   using replacement gate or "RG" for short. This milestone further
   reduces the risk for our RG transition. As a reminder, our first RG
   node will be 128 layers and will be used for a select set of products.
   We don't expect RG to deliver meaningful cost reductions until FY2021
   when our second-generation RG node is broadly deployed. Consequently,
   we are expecting minimal cost reductions in NAND in FY2020. Our RG
   production deployment approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND
   capital investments," said Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO and president of
   Micron.

AMD Launches Ryzen 9 3900 and Ryzen 5 3500X Processors

   Today, 07:21 Discuss (6 Comments)
   AMD Tuesday expanded its 3rd generation Ryzen desktop processor lineup
   with two new product additions, the 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 3900, and
   the 6-core/12-thread Ryzen 5 3500X. Both chips are particularly
   interesting given their naming. The 3900 is a slightly subdued twin of
   the company's current flagship, the 3900X, with a small amount of clock
   speed traded off for a huge drop in TDP. This chip ticks at 3.10 GHz
   with 4.30 GHz boost, compared to 3.80/4.60 GHz frequencies of the
   3900X. Its TDP, however, is rated at just 65 W, compared to 105 W of
   the 3900X. You get 512 KB of dedicated L2 cache per core, and 64 MB of
   L3 cache.
   The Ryzen 5 3500X is another interesting part, in which the "X" makes a
   world of difference from the Ryzen 5 3500. Whilst the 3500 is a
   6-core/6-thread part devoid of SMT, the 3500X is 6-core/12-thread
   (features SMT), has the same exact 3.60 GHz nominal clocks as the
   popular Ryzen 5 3600, but a slightly lower 4.10 GHz boost frequency,
   compared to 4.20 GHz of the 3600. The Ryzen 5 3500X is expected to be
   marginally cheaper than the 3600, at around $189, and is currently only
   being offered to OEMs and system integrators in China. The company
   hasn't finalized pricing for the 3900, yet.

The End of a Collaboration: Intel Announces Discontinuation of Kaby Lake-G
with AMD Radeon Vega Graphics

   by


    Raevenlord

   Yesterday, 17:42 Discuss (11 Comments)
   The marriage of Intel and AMD IPs in the form of the Kaby Lake-G
   processors was met with both surprised grunts from the company and a
   sense of bewilderment at what could come next. Well, we now know what
   came next: Intel hiring several high-level AMD employees on the
   graphics space and putting together its own motley crew of discrete GPU
   developers, who should be putting out Intel's next-gen high-performance
   graphics accelerators sometime next year.
   The Kaby Lake-G processors, however, showed promise, pairing both
   Intel's (at the time) IPC dominance and AMD's graphics IP performance
   and expertise on a single package by placing the two components in the
   same substrate and connecting them via a PCIe link. A new and succinct
   Intel notice on the Kaby Lake-G page sets a last order time (January
   31, 2020, as the last date for orders, and July 31, 2020, as the date
   of last shipments), and explains that product market shifts have moved
   demand from Kaby Lake-G products "to other Intel products". Uptake was
   always slow on this particular collaboration - most of it, we'd guess,
   because of the chips' strange footprint arrangement for embedding in
   systems, which required custom solutions that had to be designed from
   scratch. And with Intel investing into their own high-performance
   graphics, it seems clear that there is just no need to flaunt their
   previous collaborations with other companies in this field. Farewell,
   Intel-AMD Kaby Lake-G. We barely knew you.

   features a peak Boost clock of 2025 MHz, and typical Boosts in the area
   of 1935 MHz (a 10.3% increase compared to AMD's reference specs).
   The THICC design philosophy stands the test of time here, with the card
   mainly being black colored, with some silver accents. A thick aluminium
   fin-stack fed by a copper baseplate and copper heat pipes ensure a
   constant heat transfer from the GPU chip to the fin-stack array, which
   now sees three fans working overtime to dissipate all that
   framerate-produced heat - fed by a pair of 8-pin connectors.

   Today we released the latest version of TechPowerUp GPU-Z, the popular
   graphics subsystem information, monitoring, and diagnostic utility.
   Version 2.26.0 adds support for new GPUs, introduces new features, and
   fixes problems with existing ones. To begin with, support is added for
   AMD Radeon RX 5500 and RX 5500M, TU104-based NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060
   (non-Super), and Quadro P520. Fake detection has been added for various
   "Kepler" based GTX 10-series knockoffs.
   With this release we fixed an application crash during BIOS extraction
   on nearly all NVIDIA GPUs. Another crash that appears when the
   application is launched on machines with AMD "Navi" GPUs without
   drivers installed. The ASUS ROG skin has been fixed to properly show
   the "Close" button in the bottom. We also improved the memory junction
   temperature tooltip on AMD "Navi" to denote that the hottest chip's
   junction temperature is being reported, and not an average across all
   chips. Last version's AMD Navi fan-stop fix has been reverted since AMD
   fixed the issue since their 19.9.1 drivers. PCIe and CrossFire state
   detection has been fixed for AMD "Navi" and "Vega 20" based graphics
   cards. Grab it from the link below.

   Yesterday Intel hosted an event in London, where it held a presentation
   and demonstration of new concept product. Simply called "The Element",
   this new products tries to introduce the concept of modular computing,
   where you can basically swap out parts and replace them with ease, to
   users of PCs who wanted this to happen for a long time.
   If anyone remembers Razer's project Christine, which unfortunately
   didn't take off, this product should be of no surprise to them. The
   Element is a complete PC consisting out of CPU, RAM and Storage, with a
   PCIe slot attached to it. Featuring plenty of IO options like
   Thunderbolt, HDMI, Ethernet, USB, and Wi-Fi, The Element is a complete
   solution for computing. For the demo Intel soldered a BGA Xeon CPU with
   room for two SODIMM slots for memory and two M.2 ports for storage
   expansion, all cooled by a blower fan directly cooling the CPU
   heatsink. Power is supplied from PCIe slot (75 Watts) and 8 pin
   connector which would come from a regular PSU. There is also an option
   for the card to be powered by a 19 V power source if external power
   brick is provided.

Intel Marketing Tries to Link Stability to Turbo Boost

   by


    btarunr

   Monday, 17:17 Discuss (28 Comments)
   There is no correlation between CPU frequency boosting behavior and
   system stability. Intel today launched its "10th generation" Core X
   HEDT processors, with core-counts ranging between 10 to 18, priced
   between $590 and $978. Based on the 14 nm "Cascade Lake-X" silicon,
   these chips have the same exact IPC as "Skylake" circa 2015, but offer
   nearly double the number of cores to the Dollar compared to the 9th
   generation Core X series; and add a couple of useful instruction sets
   such as DLBoost, which accelerates DNN training/building; a few more
   AVX-512 instructions, and an updated Turbo Boost Max 3.0 algorithm. The
   chips offer clock-speed bumps over the previous generation.
   Intel's main trade-call for these processors? Taking another stab at
   AMD for falling short on boost frequency in the hands of consumers.
   "The chip that hits frequency benchmarks as promised, our new #CoreX
   -series processor, provides a stable, high-performance platform for
   visual creators everywhere," reads the Intel tweet, as if to suggest
   that reaching the "promised" clock speed results in stability. AMD was
   confronted with alarming statistics of consumers whose 3rd generation
   Ryzen processors wouldn't reach their advertised boost frequencies. The
   company released an updated AGESA microcode that fixed this.

   Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a world leader in advanced semiconductor
   technology, today announced that it has developed the industry's first
   12-layer 3D-TSV (Through Silicon Via) technology. Samsung's new
   innovation is considered one of the most challenging packaging
   technologies for mass production of high-performance chips, as it
   requires pinpoint accuracy to vertically interconnect 12 DRAM chips
   through a three-dimensional configuration of more than 60,000 TSV
   holes, each of which is one-twentieth the thickness of a single strand
   of human hair.
   The thickness of the package (720 µm) remains the same as current
   8-layer High Bandwidth Memory-2 (HBM2) products, which is a substantial
   advancement in component design. This will help customers release
   next-generation, high-capacity products with higher performance
   capacity without having to change their system configuration designs.
   In addition, the 3D packaging technology also features a shorter data
   transmission time between chips than the currently existing wire
   bonding technology, resulting in significantly faster speed and lower
   power consumption.

AMD Zen 3 Could Bid the CCX Farewell, Feature Updated SMT

   Updated by

   Monday, 06:54 Updated: Monday, 08:22 Discuss (26 Comments)
   With its next-generation "Zen 3" CPU microarchitecture designed for the
   7 nm EUV silicon fabrication process, AMD could bid the "Zen" compute
   complex or CCX farewell, heralding chiplets with monolithic last-level
   caches (L3 caches) that are shared across all cores on the chiplet. AMD
   embraced a quad-core compute complex approach to building multi-core
   processors with "Zen." At the time, the 8-core "Zeppelin" die featured
   two CCX with four cores, each. With "Zen 2," AMD reduced the CPU
   chiplet to only containing CPU cores, L3 cache, and an Infinity Fabric
   interface, talking to an I/O controller die elsewhere on the processor
   package. This reduces the economic or technical utility in retaining
   the CCX topology, which limits the amount of L3 cache individual cores
   can access.
   This and more juicy details about "Zen 3" were put out by a leaked
   (later deleted) technical presentation by company CTO Mark Papermaster.
   On the EPYC side of things, AMD's design efforts will be spearheaded by
   the "Milan" multi-chip module, featuring up to 64 cores spread across
   eight 8-core chiplets. Papermaster talked about how the individual
   chiplets will feature "unified" 32 MB of last-level cache, which means
   a deprecation of the CCX topology. He also detailed an updated SMT
   implementation that doubles the number of logical processors per
   physical core. The I/O interface of "Milan" will retain PCI-Express gen
   4.0 and eight-channel DDR4 memory interface.

NVIDIA Could Launch Next-Generation Ampere GPUs in 1H 2020

   by


    AleksandarK

   Monday, 06:00 Discuss (30 Comments)
   According to the sources over at Igor's Lab, NVIDIA could launch its
   next generation of GPUs, codenamed "Ampere", as soon as first half of
   the 2020 arrives. Having just recently launched GeForce RTX Super
   lineup, NVIDIA could surprise us again in the coming months with
   replacement for it's Turing lineup of graphics cards. Expected to
   directly replace high-end GPU models that are currently present, like
   GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 2080 Super, Ampere should bring many
   performance and technology advancements a new graphics card generation
   is usually associated with.
   For starters, we could expect a notable die shrink to take place in
   form of 7 nm node, which will replace the aging 12 nm process that
   Turing is currently being built on. This alone should bring more than
   50% increase in transistor density, resulting in much more performance
   and lower power consumption compared to previous generation. NVIDIA's
   foundry of choice is still unknown, however current speculations are
   predicting that Samsung will manufacture Ampere, possibly due to
   delivery issues that are taking place at TSMC. Architectural
   improvements should take place as well. Ray tracing is expected to
   persist and get enhanced with possibly more hardware allocated for it,
   along with better software to support the ray tracing ecosystem of
   applications.

   A man broke into the offices of Valve Software in September, and did
   away with $40,000 worth equipment and game keys. He was caught on
   camera trying to sell these keys at a Game Stop store. 32-year-old
   Shawn Shaputis already had six warrants for his arrest out on him when
   he broke into the Bellevue WA offices of one of the world's largest
   game distribution companies. The suspect is still at large, and is
   summoned to appear before court. Should he fail to show up, additional
   warrants for arrest will be put out. Valve Software owns Steam, the
   world's largest online game distribution platform.

   Blizzard employees protested the company's decision to ban Hearthstone
   player "Blitzchung" from an event for his opinions on the ongoing
   situation in Hong Kong SAR. Some employees covered up a portion of a
   floor decal in the company's office that read "Think Globally," and
   "Every Voice Matters," in protest. Blizzard's MMORPGs are "massively"
   popular in China, with Chinese Internet giant Tencent holding an equity
   stake. Some see the move to ban "Blitzchung" as the company "bending
   the knee" to China by taking a position on the situation in Hong Kong,
   instead of remaining neutral. The picture of a ruled piece of paper
   covering up the company floor decal with duct tape was tweeted by
   former Blizzard employee and eSports industry observer Kevin Hovdestad.

                Micron Tapes Out 128-layer 3D NAND Flash Memory

   by


    btarunr

   Today, 07:59 Discuss (0 Comments)

   Micron Technology has taped out its 4th generation 3D NAND flash memory
   with 128 layers. This paves the way for mass production and product
   implementations in 2020. The 4th gen 3D NAND by Micron continues to use
   a CMOS-under-array design, but with Replacement Gate (RG) Technology
   instead of Floating Gate, which Micron and the erstwhile IMFlash
   Technology had been using for years. Micron is currently mass-producing
   96-layer 3D NAND flash, and TLC remains the prominent data-storage
   physical layer despite the advent of QLC (4 bits per cell).
   Micron comments that this 4th gen 128-layer 3D NAND will be a stopgap
   restricted to a select few applications, and may not see the kind of
   adoption as its current 96-layer chips. The company appears to be more
   focused on its evolution, possibly the 5th generation 3D NAND, which
   are expected to bring tangible cost-per-bit gains for the company, as
   it transitions to a newer silicon fabrication node, and implements even
   newer technologies besides RG. "We achieved our first yielding dies
   using replacement gate or "RG" for short. This milestone further
   reduces the risk for our RG transition. As a reminder, our first RG
   node will be 128 layers and will be used for a select set of products.
   We don't expect RG to deliver meaningful cost reductions until FY2021
   when our second-generation RG node is broadly deployed. Consequently,
   we are expecting minimal cost reductions in NAND in FY2020. Our RG
   production deployment approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND
   capital investments," said Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO and president of
   Micron.

             AMD Launches Ryzen 9 3900 and Ryzen 5 3500X Processors

   Today, 07:21 Discuss (6 Comments)

   AMD Tuesday expanded its 3rd generation Ryzen desktop processor lineup
   with two new product additions, the 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 3900, and
   the 6-core/12-thread Ryzen 5 3500X. Both chips are particularly
   interesting given their naming. The 3900 is a slightly subdued twin of
   the company's current flagship, the 3900X, with a small amount of clock
   speed traded off for a huge drop in TDP. This chip ticks at 3.10 GHz
   with 4.30 GHz boost, compared to 3.80/4.60 GHz frequencies of the
   3900X. Its TDP, however, is rated at just 65 W, compared to 105 W of
   the 3900X. You get 512 KB of dedicated L2 cache per core, and 64 MB of
   L3 cache.
   The Ryzen 5 3500X is another interesting part, in which the "X" makes a
   world of difference from the Ryzen 5 3500. Whilst the 3500 is a
   6-core/6-thread part devoid of SMT, the 3500X is 6-core/12-thread
   (features SMT), has the same exact 3.60 GHz nominal clocks as the
   popular Ryzen 5 3600, but a slightly lower 4.10 GHz boost frequency,
   compared to 4.20 GHz of the 3600. The Ryzen 5 3500X is expected to be
   marginally cheaper than the 3600, at around $189, and is currently only
   being offered to OEMs and system integrators in China. The company
   hasn't finalized pricing for the 3900, yet.

   Noctua today introduced the long awaited all-black versions of its
   award-winning NH-D15, NH-U12S and NH-L9i CPU coolers. Staying true to
   the successful formula of the original models, the new chromax.black

   NH-D15 chromax.black and NH-U12S chromax.black will initially be
   exclusively available in a Linus Tech Tips limited edition that
   includes extra orange anti-vibration pads and custom fan stickers.
   "Our customers have been asking us for all-black coolers for a long
   time, but we're soldering the fins to the heatpipes in order to
   guarantee optimal performance over many years of usage and this
   production process is difficult to combine with coatings," explains
   Roland Mossig (Noctua CEO). "It took a lot of time and engineering work
   to find an appropriate coating material and production process that
   gave us satisfactory thermal performance and consistent visual
   appearance. Now, we're proud with the end result and confident that the
   new chromax.black coolers will meet the high standards Noctua users
   have come to expect."

The End of a Collaboration: Intel Announces Discontinuation of Kaby Lake-G with
                            AMD Radeon Vega Graphics

   Yesterday, 17:42 Discuss (11 Comments)

   The marriage of Intel and AMD IPs in the form of the Kaby Lake-G
   processors was met with both surprised grunts from the company and a
   sense of bewilderment at what could come next. Well, we now know what
   came next: Intel hiring several high-level AMD employees on the
   graphics space and putting together its own motley crew of discrete GPU
   developers, who should be putting out Intel's next-gen high-performance
   graphics accelerators sometime next year.
   The Kaby Lake-G processors, however, showed promise, pairing both
   Intel's (at the time) IPC dominance and AMD's graphics IP performance
   and expertise on a single package by placing the two components in the
   same substrate and connecting them via a PCIe link. A new and succinct
   Intel notice on the Kaby Lake-G page sets a last order time (January
   31, 2020, as the last date for orders, and July 31, 2020, as the date
   of last shipments), and explains that product market shifts have moved
   demand from Kaby Lake-G products "to other Intel products". Uptake was
   always slow on this particular collaboration - most of it, we'd guess,
   because of the chips' strange footprint arrangement for embedding in
   systems, which required custom solutions that had to be designed from
   scratch. And with Intel investing into their own high-performance
   graphics, it seems clear that there is just no need to flaunt their
   previous collaborations with other companies in this field. Farewell,
   Intel-AMD Kaby Lake-G. We barely knew you.

   XFX today finally launched their thick, custom version of the AMD
   Navi-powered RX 5700 XT. The new RX 5700 XT THICC III Ultra features a
   triple-slot (well, 2.7 slots, but who's counting but we?) cooling
   solution with three cooling fans, thus upping the ante compared to
   previous XFX THICC graphics cards. XFX boasts hat their THICC III Ultra
   features a peak Boost clock of 2025 MHz, and typical Boosts in the area
   of 1935 MHz (a 10.3% increase compared to AMD's reference specs).
   The THICC design philosophy stands the test of time here, with the card
   mainly being black colored, with some silver accents. A thick aluminium
   fin-stack fed by a copper baseplate and copper heat pipes ensure a
   constant heat transfer from the GPU chip to the fin-stack array, which
   now sees three fans working overtime to dissipate all that
   framerate-produced heat - fed by a pair of 8-pin connectors.

   Today we released the latest version of TechPowerUp GPU-Z, the popular
   graphics subsystem information, monitoring, and diagnostic utility.
   Version 2.26.0 adds support for new GPUs, introduces new features, and
   fixes problems with existing ones. To begin with, support is added for
   AMD Radeon RX 5500 and RX 5500M, TU104-based NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060
   (non-Super), and Quadro P520. Fake detection has been added for various
   "Kepler" based GTX 10-series knockoffs.
   With this release we fixed an application crash during BIOS extraction
   on nearly all NVIDIA GPUs. Another crash that appears when the
   application is launched on machines with AMD "Navi" GPUs without
   drivers installed. The ASUS ROG skin has been fixed to properly show
   the "Close" button in the bottom. We also improved the memory junction
   temperature tooltip on AMD "Navi" to denote that the hottest chip's
   junction temperature is being reported, and not an average across all
   chips. Last version's AMD Navi fan-stop fix has been reverted since AMD
   fixed the issue since their 19.9.1 drivers. PCIe and CrossFire state
   detection has been fixed for AMD "Navi" and "Vega 20" based graphics
   cards. Grab it from the link below.

             Intel Marketing Tries to Link Stability to Turbo Boost

   There is no correlation between CPU frequency boosting behavior and
   system stability. Intel today launched its "10th generation" Core X
   HEDT processors, with core-counts ranging between 10 to 18, priced
   between $590 and $978. Based on the 14 nm "Cascade Lake-X" silicon,
   these chips have the same exact IPC as "Skylake" circa 2015, but offer
   nearly double the number of cores to the Dollar compared to the 9th
   generation Core X series; and add a couple of useful instruction sets
   such as DLBoost, which accelerates DNN training/building; a few more
   AVX-512 instructions, and an updated Turbo Boost Max 3.0 algorithm. The
   chips offer clock-speed bumps over the previous generation.
   Intel's main trade-call for these processors? Taking another stab at
   AMD for falling short on boost frequency in the hands of consumers.
   "The chip that hits frequency benchmarks as promised, our new #CoreX
   -series processor, provides a stable, high-performance platform for
   visual creators everywhere," reads the Intel tweet, as if to suggest
   that reaching the "promised" clock speed results in stability. AMD was
   confronted with alarming statistics of consumers whose 3rd generation
   Ryzen processors wouldn't reach their advertised boost frequencies. The
   company released an updated AGESA microcode that fixed this.

   Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a world leader in advanced semiconductor
   technology, today announced that it has developed the industry's first
   12-layer 3D-TSV (Through Silicon Via) technology. Samsung's new
   innovation is considered one of the most challenging packaging
   technologies for mass production of high-performance chips, as it
   requires pinpoint accuracy to vertically interconnect 12 DRAM chips
   through a three-dimensional configuration of more than 60,000 TSV
   holes, each of which is one-twentieth the thickness of a single strand
   of human hair.
   The thickness of the package (720 µm) remains the same as current
   8-layer High Bandwidth Memory-2 (HBM2) products, which is a substantial
   advancement in component design. This will help customers release
   next-generation, high-capacity products with higher performance
   capacity without having to change their system configuration designs.
   In addition, the 3D packaging technology also features a shorter data
   transmission time between chips than the currently existing wire
   bonding technology, resulting in significantly faster speed and lower
   power consumption.

           AMD Zen 3 Could Bid the CCX Farewell, Feature Updated SMT

   Updated by

   Monday, 06:54 Updated: Monday, 08:22 Discuss (26 Comments)

   With its next-generation "Zen 3" CPU microarchitecture designed for the
   7 nm EUV silicon fabrication process, AMD could bid the "Zen" compute
   complex or CCX farewell, heralding chiplets with monolithic last-level
   caches (L3 caches) that are shared across all cores on the chiplet. AMD
   embraced a quad-core compute complex approach to building multi-core
   processors with "Zen." At the time, the 8-core "Zeppelin" die featured
   two CCX with four cores, each. With "Zen 2," AMD reduced the CPU
   chiplet to only containing CPU cores, L3 cache, and an Infinity Fabric
   interface, talking to an I/O controller die elsewhere on the processor
   package. This reduces the economic or technical utility in retaining
   the CCX topology, which limits the amount of L3 cache individual cores
   can access.
   This and more juicy details about "Zen 3" were put out by a leaked
   (later deleted) technical presentation by company CTO Mark Papermaster.
   On the EPYC side of things, AMD's design efforts will be spearheaded by
   the "Milan" multi-chip module, featuring up to 64 cores spread across
   eight 8-core chiplets. Papermaster talked about how the individual
   chiplets will feature "unified" 32 MB of last-level cache, which means
   a deprecation of the CCX topology. He also detailed an updated SMT
   implementation that doubles the number of logical processors per
   physical core. The I/O interface of "Milan" will retain PCI-Express gen
   4.0 and eight-channel DDR4 memory interface.

VIA CenTaur Develops a Multi-core x86 Processor for Enterprise with in-built
AI Hardware

   Today, 04:10 Discuss (9 Comments)
   Tasting Intel's blood in the water with AMD's return to
   competitiveness, dormant x86 licensee VIA wants to take another swing
   at the market, this time with a multi-core processor targeted at
   enterprises and possibly workstations, developed by its subsidiary
   CenTaur. The company appears to want to cash in on the AI boom, and
   could develop turnkey facial-recognition CCTV solutions with the chip.
   CenTaur is ready with a working prototype. It features eight 64-bit x86
   CPU cores, and an on-die "AI co-processor" named NCORE. A ringbus
   connects the eight CPU cores and the NCORE with the processor's other
   components. The processor features 16 MB of shared L3 cache, a
   quad-channel DDR4-3200 memory interface, and a 44-lane PCI-Express gen
   3.0 root-complex, along with a fully integrated southbridge, making it
   an SoC. It also appears to be multi-socket capable, although VIA didn't
   detail the interconnect in use.
   The NCORE is a PCI-mapped device to the software, which provides
   functions such as DNN building and training acceleration. From the
   looks of it, there's more to NCORE than simply a fixed-function
   hardware that multiplies matrices. Its developers state that the device
   accelerates AI at a rate of "20 trillion AI operations/sec with 20
   terabytes/sec memory bandwidth." The CPU cores on the processor tick at
   2.50 GHz, and while VIA hasn't made any IPC claims, it has mentioned
   support for the cutting-edge AVX-512 instruction-set, something even
   "Zen 2" lacks, which possibly indicates a powerful FPU. The silicon
   measures 195 mm², and has been built on 16 nm FinFET node at TSMC. VIA
   will demonstrate the unnamed processor and its testbed at ISC East
   2019, held on November 20 and 21.

   DeepCool rolled out the GH-01, a graphics card reinforcement stand that
   you install inside your tower-type case, to minimize PCB bending over
   time (a vastly exaggerated phenomenon). But wait, it does more: the
   stand has an RGB LED embellishment along its length, and has space to
   route your graphics card's power cables. Up to two 8-pin PCIe power
   cables can be routed. You use a thumb-screw and notches to adjust the
   GH-01's VGA support height from 47.2 mm to 154 mm. The stand itself
   measures 52.6 mm x 60.6 mm x 163.73 mm (WxDxH). It can bear a load of
   up to 5 kg. There are two sub-variants of the GH-01 based on the
   illumination type. The GH-01 RGB uses old-school RGB lighting through
   12 V 4-pin RGB control. The GH-01 LED, on the other hand, uses more
   modern 5 V addressable-RGB over a 3-pin connector. The company didn't
   reveal pricing.

HP Rejects Acquisition Offer from Xerox

   On Sunday, HP Inc. released a letter from its board of directors
   stating that it rejects acquisition offer from Xerox Corporation
   pointing out that: "We have great confidence in our strategy and our
   ability to execute to continue driving sustainable long-term value at
   HP. In addition, the Board and management team continue to take actions
   to enhance shareholder value including the deployment of our strong
   balance sheet for increased repurchases of our significantly
   undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A."
   This decision shows a strong will from the folks over at HP to continue
   their business in the way they usually done for many years.
   Additionally, HP stated the following: "We recognize the potential
   benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there
   is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential
   combination with Xerox. However, as we have previously shared in
   connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental
   questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox. We note
   the decline of Xerox's revenue from $10.2 billion to $9.2 billion (on a
   trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant
   questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future
   prospects.", showing the downsides of the potential merger and
   questioning abilities of Xerox to manage two companies.

MATLAB MKL Codepath Tweak Boosts AMD Ryzen MKL Performance Significantly

   by


    btarunr

   Yesterday, 10:53 Discuss (48 Comments)
   MATLAB is a popular math computing environment in use by engineering
   firms, universities, and other research institutes. Some of its
   operations can be made to leverage Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library),
   which is poorly optimized for, and notoriously slow on AMD Ryzen
   processors. Reddit user Nedflanders1976 devised a way to restore
   anywhere between 20 to 300 percent performance on Ryzen and Ryzen
   Threadripper processors, by forcing MATLAB to use advanced
   instruction-sets such as AVX2. By default, MKL queries your processor's
   vendor ID string, and if it sees anything other than "GenuineIntel...,"
   it falls back to SSE, posing a significant performance disadvantage to
   "AuthenticAMD" Ryzen processors that have a full IA SSE4, AVX, and AVX2
   implementation.
   The tweak, meant to be manually applied by AMD Ryzen users, forces MKL
   to use AVX2 regardless of the CPU Vendor ID query result. The tweak is
   as simple as it is powerful. A simple 4-line Windows batch file with a
   set of arguments starts MKL in AVX2 mode. You can also make the tweak
   "permanent" by creating a system environment variable. The environment
   variable will apply to all instances of MATLAB, and not just those
   spawned by the batch file. Nedflanders1976 also posted a benchmark
   script that highlights the performance impact of AVX2, however you can
   use your own scripts and post results.

Desktop AMD Radeon RX 5300 XT Rears its Head in HP Specs Sheet

    btarunr

   Yesterday, 07:32 Discuss (8 Comments)
   A desktop variant of the AMD Radeon RX 5300 XT graphics card surfaced
   in a specs sheet of an upcoming HP Pavilion desktop model
   (TP01-0004ng). The listing describes the RX 5300 XT as featuring 4 GB
   of GDDR5 memory. This is the first instance of an RX 5300 XT in the
   wild. An older report citing driver files pointed to there being only
   two RX 5300-series products, the RX 5300 (desktop), and the mobile RX
   5300M. The "XT" brand extension could denote a higher CU count than the
   RX 5300, although the series is still differentiated from the RX
   5500-series with cheaper GDDR5 memory.
   The RX 5300 series and RX 5500 series are based on a common silicon,
   the 7 nm "Navi 14," featuring up to 24 RDNA compute units (up to 1,536
   stream processors), and a 128-bit wide memory interface that supports
   up to 8 GB of GDDR6 or GDDR5 memory. AMD hopes to phase out its 14 nm
   and 12 nm "Polaris 10" and "Polaris 30" chips with "Navi 14." It's
   possible that the RX 5300 XT is OEM-only, just like the other key
   component in this HP desktop, the Ryzen 5 3500 6-core/6-thread
   processor.

   For those wanting 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 on their desktops without an M.2
   E-key slot on their motherboards, ASUS came up with the PCE-AX3000, a
   low-profile capable (half-height) NIC that provides up to 3000 Mbps
   (2.4 Gbps over 5 GHz and 600 Mbps over 2.4 GHz) wireless connectivity,
   and the added convenience of Bluetooth 5.0 for short-range
   communications. A set of MU-MIMO antennae come included. Besides
   MU-MIMO, the card supports OFDMA for better collision-prevention with
   other devices in the same channel, and WPA3 security protocol. The NIC
   is essentially a PCI-Express 3.0 x1 add-on card with an M.2 E-key slot
   that holds an Intel AX200 "Cyclone Peak" WLAN card. We expect the
   AX3000 to be priced well under $50 given that the "Cyclone Peak" card
   at the heart of it costs just $10-17 in volume pricing.

MSI Prepares Another Version of AMD Radeon RX 580 Armor Graphics Card

   Friday, 20:26 Discuss (30 Comments)
   While AMD is giving all signs of being preparing to release their
   latest entries into the midrange graphics card market in the form of
   the RX 5500 and RX 5300 series of graphics cards based on Navi, AMD's
   AIB partners are giving the slow burn on existing inventories of AMD's
   Polaris graphics chips. MSI, in this case, seems to have bet on a
   slight redesign of their previously-released RX 580 Armor and Armor
   MK2.
   Changed is the color scheme - MSI went full black on this one. There's
   also a redesigned PCB, a redesigned I/O bracket (which keeps four
   display connectors), and a new cooler shroud. The heatsink's surface
   area also seems to have been increased, which should provide lower
   operating temperatures (anything beyond that, such as higher
   overclockability and longer lifespan, are speculations). The redesigned
   Armor keeps the single 8-pin PCIe power connector. No other details are
   available at time of writing.

Curiously Named "Athlon Gold" Surfaces on Geekbench Database

   by


    btarunr

   Friday, 18:24 Discuss (13 Comments)
   A Geekbench database submission from an HP "17-ca2xxx" laptop (likely a
   prototype), spilled the beans on an upcoming AMD Athlon Gold 3150U
   processor, with nomenclature that looks inspired from the Pentium Gold.
   Intel uses the "Gold" and "Silver" brand extensions to distinguish
   processors based on its performance microarchitectures from those based
   on its low-power microarchitectures (eg: a "Skylake" based Pentium
   Gold, and a "Goldmont" based Pentium Silver). The addition of "Gold" to
   the Athlon brand could denote performance rivaling mobile versions of
   Pentium Gold found in entry-level full-size notebooks.
   Moving on to the test itself, and we see the Athlon Gold 3150U being
   listed as a "Raven Ridge" derivative featuring a 2-core/4-thread CPU
   and Radeon graphics (likely "Vega 3" as with its desktop counterpart).
   The CPU is shown having a 2.40 GHz base frequency, and 3.30 GHz boost,
   512 KB L2 cache per core, and 4 MB shared L3 cache. The chip scores
   3,559 single-core points, and 7,336 points multi-core, comparable to
   entry-level dual-core processors from this generation. This makes us
   wonder what the Athlon "Silver" could be, and whether AMD is working on
   a new low-power microarchitecture in the near future.

   damage to components from overheating when your GPU still works well
   under that scenario. GIGABYTE graphics cards are a good choice for

Intel Recalls Boxed Xeon E-2274G Processors Due to Inadequate Stock Cooler
Effectiveness

   Intel issued a product change notification (PCN) dated November 13,
   calling for a recall of boxed Xeon E-2274G processors from customers
   and distributors. The boxed SKU of the E-2274G, which includes a stock
   cooling solution, has been marked as "discontinued" and "end of life."
   Intel is offering an E-2274G tray processor (chip-only) as replacement
   for the returned inventory. The cause for the recall is the cooling
   solution included in the boxed SKU, which has been found to be
   insufficient to cool the E-2274G, a 4-core/8-thread processor based on
   the 14 nm++ "Coffee Lake" microarchitecture, with a rated TDP of 88 W.
   The E973708-003 fan-heatsink included with boxed Xeon E-2274G
   processors is supplied by Foxconn, and has been known to be bundled
   with Intel's entry-level client-segment processors, such as the Pentium
   Gold series and Core i3 series (chips with TDP typically rated 65 W or
   less). It features a thin, circular, all-aluminium heatsink, which
   lacks a copper core that certain other LGA115x-compatible stock coolers
   by Intel have. The heatsink makes contact with the CPU over pre-applied
   TIM on an aluminium surface, with spirally-projecting fins dissipating
   heat under the fan's airflow. It could be been an oversight bundling
   such an underpowered cooler with an 88 W TDP processor that's designed
   for the rigors of mission-critical use-cases such as workstations and
   small-business servers.

NVIDIA "Ampere" Successor Reportedly Codenamed "Hopper"

   NVIDIA has reportedly codenamed a future GPU architecture "Hopper," in
   honor of Grace Hopper, an eminent computer scientist who invented one
   of the first linkers, and programmed the Harvard Mark I computer that
   aided the American war efforts in World War II. This came to light as
   Twitter user "@kopite7kimi," who's had a fairly high hit-rate with
   NVIDIA info tweeted not just the codename, but also a key NVIDIA
   product design change. The tweets were later deleted, but not before
   3DCenter.org reported on them. To begin with, "Hopper" is reportedly
   succeeding the upcoming "Ampere" architecture slated for the first half
   of 2020.
   "Hopper" is also rumored to introduce MCM (multi-chip module) GPU
   packages, which are packages with multiple GPU dies. Currently, GPU
   MCMs are packages that have one GPU die surrounded by memory dies or
   stacks. This combination of GPU dies could make up "giant cores," at
   least in the higher end of the performance spectrum. NVIDIA reserves
   MCMs for only its most expensive Tesla family of compute accelerators,
   or Quadro professional graphics cards, and seldom offers client-segment
   GeForce products.
