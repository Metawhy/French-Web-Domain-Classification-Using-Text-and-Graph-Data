Baked Pumpkin Donuts

   I've never made successful baked pumpkin donuts before this year, so
   I'm very excited to share this recipe with you today. Using the batter
   from pumpkin cheesecake muffins, make homemade pumpkin donuts with
   brown sugar icing for fall breakfast or snack-time. This brown sugar
   icing sets, so the donuts are easy to stack and transport! Read more

Best Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies

   I'm confident you'll love these pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. I
   worked hard to create a soft and chewy pumpkin cookie that's not cakey
   like most pumpkin cookie recipes. Omitting the egg, using melted
   butter, and blotting the pumpkin guarantee these pumpkin cookies taste
   like our favorite chewy chocolate chip cookies-- and with brilliant
   pumpkin spice flavor. They're a MUST try this fall season. read more
