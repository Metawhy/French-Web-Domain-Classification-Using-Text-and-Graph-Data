IPDPS 2020 VENUE

   New Orleans is one of the most eccentric and lively cities in the
   world. Whatever your interests are, New Orleans has you covered. From
   its diverse culture, distinctive cuisine, rich history, colorful
   celebrations, live music, vibrant nightlife, and world-class
   restaurants, there is something for everyone. It is home to a number of
   engaging museums, including the World War II Museum, the New Orleans
   Museum of Art, the Historic Voodoo Museum, Mardi Gras World, and the
   Pharmacy Museum. A visit wouldn’t be complete without a swamp tour,
   Mississippi river cruise and a stop at Café du Monde for beignets. Join
   IPDPS in 2020 to find out what makes New Orleans so unique and special.
