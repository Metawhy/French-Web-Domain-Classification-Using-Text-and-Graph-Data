This island is going trash free—by recycling all of its waste

The Danish island of Bornholm has an aging incinerator that will soon need
replacement. Instead, the local government is adopting a totally new system.

     Society.

   Imagine a whole community reusing or recycling every last scrap of
   waste. That may sound utopian, but perhaps not on the Danish island of
   Bornholm.

   By 2032 all waste on Bornholm will be treated as resources, say
   officials. Garbage sorting, recycling, minimizing waste, and a lot of
   new technology are the tools envisioned to turn Bornholm into one of
   the first garbage-free communities on the planet.

   Bornholm, the easternmost island of Denmark, is a 227 square-mile (588
   square-kilometer) granite rock jutting out of the Baltic Sea. Known for
   its quaint fishing villages and sunny climate, it is a popular vacation
   destination with a permanent population of 40,000 and another 600,000
   annual visitors.

   “By 2032 we aim to reuse or recycle everything,” says Jens
   Hjul-Nielsen, CEO of BOFA, the island’s waste management company and
   key architect behind the garbage-free vision. “How we get to that point
   is an exciting process, because there is so much we don’t yet know. We
   have a vision, but no clear-cut plan on how to get there.”

   As the island’s only waste-incineration facility is wearing out, the
   bold decision was made last December to close it down in 2032 and make
   the transition towards a garbage-free society.

   “Operating a waste management company on such a small scale as we do
   here has its challenges, so instead of investing in a new incineration
   facility, we decided to simply eliminate landfill and incineration as
   waste management options. We wanted to try something different and
   utilize that we are a society in miniature, complete with businesses,
   private households and tourism, where we can experiment and gain
   knowledge that later may be scaled up to a national or even a global
   level,” explains Hjul-Nielsen.

The vision

   In BOFA’s vision of the future, the citizens of Bornholm will sort all
   their waste into different fractions, easy to collect and use in new
   resource loops. Metal, plastics, glass, paper, and cardboard are widely
   recycled, and new waste fractions such as fishing nets and insulation
   materials will be added to the sorting and recycling system. Meanwhile,
   organic waste will be converted into energy together with green garden
   and park waste, while the nutrient-rich residue from the energy
   extraction is used as fertilizer in fields, parks and gardens, writes
   BOFA.

   In this circular economy, the inhabitants will reuse everything from
   furniture to children’s clothing and make use of sharing economy
   services—for instance lending, renting, or bartering goods through the
   internet or peer communities.

   In elementary schools children will be educated as “resource heroes”
   with practical lessons in waste, resources, the environment, and
   nature. And a university research center on models of green transition
   and the circular economy will be established on Bornholm.

The “Green Island”

   It was a unanimous municipal council that decided to close the
   incineration facility and embrace this bold vision back in December.

   But a green mind-set is not new to the local government. The
   municipality already adopted a “Bright Green Island” strategy to
   position itself as a leader in sustainable development, aiming to be
   CO2-neutral by 2025, convert to green energy sources, and expand the
   island’s organic farm land.

   “Yet, in the waste area we were lagging behind, so it was important for
   us to move ahead in this sector as well,” says Anne Thomas, the deputy
   mayor of Bornholm.

   “As a first-mover in this kind of area, you can benefit from
   development funding from national and international sources like the
   EU,” she adds. “As a last-mover you benefit from all the
   trial-and-error that has gone before, and the technology is far cheaper
   to implement. Being in the middle field is the really heavy place to
   be. For us, the decision to be first-movers here was not a difficult
   one.”

The transition

   Today, Bornholm recycles 39 percent of its household waste. The first
   step to becoming garbage-free is to increase this number, so that far
   more waste is sorted, recycled, and reused. That is in itself a huge
   task, “yet we know how to do all of this,” says Thomas.

   “The really exciting stuff comes in the second phase where we shall be
   exploring new ways of working with companies, changing production
   processes, engaging the population, and testing new methods for waste
   management.”

   Looking ahead to the final phase of transition, things become more
   uncertain, notes Hjul-Nielsen. “After all, we don’t even know what kind
   of waste there will be in the future—some types of material that need
   special handling now may be banned by then, or new materials may have
   been invented. The door can swing both ways, making our work easier or
   harder,” he says.

   New technology will play an important part in meeting those challenges.
   BOFA is counting on attracting companies interested in testing new
   technology in a small arena like Bornholm before rolling it out on a
   larger scale—for instance new methods of breaking down and treating
   materials that are not available today. “And just four months in, we
   are already seeing an interest from some really major companies,” says
   the CEO.

The people

   Even so, new technology alone will not drive the change.

   The involvement and good will of the population will be a critical
   factor, emphasizes Jens Hjul-Nielsen. “As the interest in
   sustainability is gaining ground we are already on the winning team, as
   long as it doesn’t become expensive or difficult for people to deal
   with in their everyday lives. If it does, we might lose them.”

   As it is now, the citizens of Bornholm pay a waste disposal tax to the
   municipality of approximately 3000 Danish kroner ($454 USD) a year per
   household for all waste management, including a weekly collection and
   treatment service (if you have less waste, you may opt for a
   fortnightly service).

   To finance the first step of extending the sorted waste to seven
   fractions—food, glass, metal, paper, cardboard, plastic, and wood—the
   local government has approved a waste disposal tax increase of 15
   percent, adding $68 USD to each household’s annual tax from 2022. This
   step is in compliance with a nationwide policy that 50 percent of all
   household waste must be sorted into the seven fractions for recycling
   by 2022.

   “The next step of becoming fully garbage-free is to be funded by
   internal reprioritization as well as external sources and
   collaborators. If this doesn’t suffice, we are budgeting with a maximal
   additional tax increase of one to two percent annually, or about $4.5
   to $11 USD per household,” says Hjul-Nielsen.

   BOFA is involved in an array of projects to engage the general public
   and the private sector in the transition. For example, one project is
   looking at different types of households—a fishing village with many
   tourists, a complex of townhouses, a small farming village—to
   understand the challenges of sorting and minimizing waste in different
   living situations and find the best solutions and ways of motivating
   people.

   Other projects aim to encourage the production of goods with
   replaceable parts and reduce packaging, produce information material
   and explore—in dialogue with the tourist industry—the best ways to help
   visitors understand and use the sorting system.

Leading the way

   “I meet a keen interest in correct waste management out there. A lot of
   villages and communities on Bornholm are already working towards a
   greener future and sharing their ideas with each other,” says the
   deputy mayor. “Transitioning to a circular economy is not just a
   question of buying more garbage cans, it’s about new methods and new
   behavior, a whole new way of thinking.”

   But what if the island hasn’t realized its goal of being entirely
   garbage-free by 2032—is there a plan B?

   We are committed to the long-term goal, even if it takes slightly
   longer to get there than planned, says Jens Hjul-Nielsen. “If we still
   have a small amount of residual waste left by 2032, well, then we will
   send that for incineration at a facility off island and that will be
   the project to solve for 2033—but we will still have taken a huge step
   forward compared to where we are today.”

How ‘Ugly’ Fruits and Vegetables Can Help Solve World Hunger

About a third of the planet’s food goes to waste, often because of its looks.
That’s enough to feed two billion people.

   PUBLISHED March 2016

   Tristram Stuart has 24 hours to produce a restaurant meal for 50
   people—to plan a menu, gather food, then welcome guests to a venue in a
   city not his own. Complicating what sounds like a reality-show contest
   is a singular rule: Nearly all the ingredients must be sourced from
   farms and vendors intending to throw them out.

   After racing back to New York City from a New Jersey farm where he
   gleaned 75 pounds of crookneck squash deemed by the farmers too crooked
   to sell, Stuart bolts from a car creeping through traffic and darts
   into a Greenwich Village bakery. Tall and blond, with a posh English
   accent, he launches into his ten-second spiel: “I run an organization
   that campaigns against food waste, and I’m pulling together a feast
   tomorrow made with food that won’t be sold or donated to charity. Do
   you have any bread that we could use?” The bakery doesn’t, but the
   clerk hands him two broken chocolate-chip cookies as consolation.

   Stuart flings himself into the car. His next stop: the Union Square
   farmers market, where he spies a chef wrapping fish in squares of
   brioche dough, then trimming them into half circles. “Can I have your
   corners?” Stuart asks, with a meant-to-be-charming smile. The chef,
   uncharmed, declines. He’s going to make use of this dough himself.
   Undaunted, Stuart sails on through the market, delivering his pitch and
   eventually procuring discarded beet greens, wheatgrass, and apples.

   Near Apartadó, Colombia, activist Tristram Stuart examines bananas too
   short, long, or curved for the European market. Locals consume some
   rejected bananas, but growers in the region annually dump millions of
   tons of edible fruit.

   Eighteen hours later scores of chefs, food-recovery experts, and
   activists talk shop over chef Celia Lam’s squash tempura, turnip and
   tofu dumplings, and spiralized zucchini noodles. Stuart himself had
   cooked very little, but he had, without a single formal meeting,
   ensorcelled a half dozen people to devise a menu, gather ingredients,
   and then prep, cook, serve, and clean up a meal for little more than
   the chance to be associated with one of the most compelling figures in
   the international fight against food waste.

   Across cultures, food waste goes against the moral grain. After all,
   nearly 800 million people worldwide suffer from hunger. But according
   to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we
   squander enough food—globally, 2.9 trillion pounds a year—to feed every
   one of them more than twice over. Where’s all that food—about a third
   of the planet’s production—going? In developing nations much is lost
   postharvest for lack of adequate storage facilities, good roads, and
   refrigeration. In comparison, developed nations waste more food farther
   down the supply chain, when retailers order, serve, or display too much
   and when consumers ignore leftovers in the back of the fridge or toss
   perishables before they’ve expired.

   Wasting food takes an environmental toll as well. Producing food that
   no one eats—whether sausages or snickerdoodles—also squanders the
   water, fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, fuel, and land needed to grow it.
   The quantities aren’t trivial. Globally a year’s production of uneaten
   food guzzles as much water as the entire annual flow of the Volga,
   Europe’s most voluminous river. Growing the 133 billion pounds of food
   that retailers and consumers discard in the United States annually
   slurps the equivalent of more than 70 times the amount of oil lost in
   the Gulf of Mexico’s Deepwater Horizon disaster, according to American
   Wasteland author Jonathan Bloom. These staggering numbers don’t even
   include the losses from farms, fishing vessels, and slaughterhouses. If
   food waste were a country, it would be the third largest producer of
   greenhouse gases in the world, after China and the U.S. On a planet of
   finite resources, with the expectation of at least two billion more
   residents by 2050, this profligacy, Stuart argues in his book Waste:
   Uncovering the Global Food Scandal, is obscene.

   At a Paris feast chefs simmer cosmetically challenged veggies—gleaned
   or donated—into a curry for 6,100 anti-waste enthusiasts.

   Others have been making similar arguments for years, but reducing food
   waste has become a matter of international urgency. Some U.S. schools,
   where children dump up to 40 percent of their lunches into the trash,
   are setting up sharing tables, letting students serve themselves
   portions they know they’ll eat, allotting more time for lunch, and
   scheduling it after recess—all proven methods of boosting consumption.
   Countless businesses, such as grocery stores, restaurants, and
   cafeterias, have stepped forward to combat waste by quantifying how
   much edible food isn’t consumed, optimizing their purchasing, shrinking
   portion sizes, and beefing up efforts to move excess to charities.
   Stuart himself has made a specialty of investigating conditions farther
   up the supply chain, where supermarket standards and ordering practices
   lead to massive, but mostly hidden, dumps of edible food.

   Fifty miles north of Lima, Peru, in the farming town of Huaral, Stuart
   sips a glass of freshly squeezed satsuma juice with Luis Garibaldi,
   whose Fundo Maria Luisa is the largest grower of mandarins in the
   country. Pitched forward in his seat under a poolside pergola, Stuart
   asks: How much do you export? How much is rejected? For what reason?
   And what happens to those discards? Seventy percent of his crop,
   Garibaldi says, is exported to the European Union and North America.
   But 30 percent won’t be the right size, color, or sweetness, or it
   might have blemishes, scars, scratches, sunburn, fungus, or spiders. To
   local markets most of these rejects go, netting Garibaldi just
   one-third the price of the exports.

   Stuart works through a ladder of queries that lead to a general thesis:
   Supermarkets’ cosmetic standards are crazily exacting—until supply
   shrinks, at which point they crumble like a chocolate lattice.
   Lost En Route
   Every year some 2.9 trillion pounds of food—about a third of all that
   the world produces—never get consumed. Along the supply chain fruits
   and vegetables are lost or wasted at higher rates than other foods.
   Easily bruised and vulnerable to temperature swings en route from farm
   to table, they’re also usually the first to get tossed at home.

   “So grocers purchase this slightly imperfect fruit, and consumers still
   buy it?” Stuart asks.

   “Yes,” Garibaldi says, nodding.

   In the fragrant orchard, which lies in a valley under the parched
   crenellations of the Cordilleran foothills, Stuart plucks a mandarin
   unfit for any market but stops short of eating it. “I don’t mind
   maggots, actually, but that one was fermented,” he says, choosing
   instead a fruit with two tiny brown spots. Fundo Maria Luisa, it turns
   out, generates relatively little waste, thanks to its U.K.
   representative, who examines shipments and negotiates with any buyers
   poised to reject fruit for specious reasons. Often, Garibaldi says, a
   supermarket’s rejection of food for cosmetic reasons is merely a
   cover-up for its inaccurate forecasts or an unexpected drop in sales.
   Either way, the grower is expected to eat the loss.

   Thirty percent of the mandarin crop in Huaral, Peru, won’t meet
   exacting export standards. Most of the rejects will be eaten locally.
   Globally 46 percent of fruits and vegetables never make it from farm to
   fork.

   We drive 200 miles south, past tall sand dunes and wind-eroded ridges.
   All is ocher and dust until we reach valleys suddenly verdant with
   irrigated farmland—a consequence of foreign investment, favorable trade
   agreements, cheap labor, a warm climate, and a once bountiful aquifer.
   In the Ica Region, Stuart interviews a farmer who annually abandons in
   his fields millions of stalks of asparagus too thin or too curved or
   with bud tips slightly too open to export. Next a producer tells him
   that he dumps more than a thousand tons of infinitesimally imperfect
   Minneola tangelos and a hundred tons of grapefruit a year into a
   sandpit behind his packhouse.

   Grade standards—industry driven and voluntary—were devised long ago to
   provide growers and buyers with a common language for evaluating
   produce and mediating disputes. They also can help reduce food waste.
   If growers can sort their asparagus or tangelos into established
   grades, they stand a better chance of finding markets for their
   “seconds.” Supermarkets have always been free to set their own
   standards, of course, but in recent years upscale grocers have started
   running their produce departments like beauty pageants, responding to
   customers, they say, who expect only platonically ideal produce: apples
   round and shiny, asparagus straight and tightly budded.

   “It’s all about quality and appearance,” says Rick Stein, vice
   president of fresh foods at the Food Marketing Institute. “And only the
   best appearance will capture share of the consumer’s wallet.” Some of
   the produce that doesn’t capture share will be donated to food banks or
   chopped up and used in a supermarket’s prepared meals or salad bar, but
   most of U.S. grocers’ excess food is neither donated nor recycled.
   Stuart applauds some U.S. and EU supermarkets’ recent campaigns to sell
   “ugly” produce at a discount, but he prefers a systemic fix. “It would
   be far better to simply relax the standards,” he says, surveying a sea
   of abandoned Peruvian citrus for which no secondary market—ugly or
   otherwise—exists.

   Gleaning for Good

   In the Picardy region of France a volunteer helps glean 1,100 pounds of
   potatoes too small to harvest mechanically. The potatoes will join
   carrots, eggplants, and other gleaned and donated vegetables at Paris’s
   Place de la République. There volunteers allied with Stuart’s group
   Feedback will chop this bounty into a meal for 6,100 diners. Feedback
   has helped organize more than 30 of these public feasts around the
   world to raise awareness of food waste and inspire local solutions.

   For seven days Stuart traipses around farms and packhouses, runs
   through his questions, gathers data, and samples rejects. Between
   visits he folds himself like a fruit bat into the backseat of a crowded
   car and types. Tap, tap. He’s working out logistics for his next
   research trip, then accepting a drinks invitation from the general
   manager of the Food Bank of Peru. Tap, tap. An appointment with a food
   rescuer who just flew up from Santiago, Chile. Everywhere he goes, it
   seems, people want to tell Stuart an egregious story about food waste.

   Sleep-deprived, unshaven, and sometimes hungover—what’s the point of
   being in a new country if you can’t sample what’s locally
   fermented?—Stuart remains focused. In fume-choked traffic he arranges
   to meet with a Peruvian congressman trying to overturn tax laws that
   incentivize dumping excess food over donating it. As we careen down a
   serpentine road, he taps out revisions to a proposed
   food-waste-reduction bill in the U.K. Parliament and a letter in
   support of expanding the authority of the U.K.’s Groceries Code
   Adjudicator. Next he floats to colleagues the idea of a Lima “disco
   soup”—a communal meal of rejected food, similar to the feast in New
   York City—to be held in four days for 50 to 100 people.

   Reducing Waste: How You Can Help

   Developed countries are responsible for most of the food left uneaten
   on grocery-store shelves, on restaurant plates, and in home
   refrigerators. Here are some tips to reduce your waste footprint.

   AT A STORE

   AT A RESTAURANT

   Make careful decisions about what and how much you buy at the grocery
   store.

   • Shop at stores that offer misshapen food at a discount.

   • Purchase prepared meals at the deli or salad bar, which allows
   supermarkets to make use of imperfect produce.

   • Buy frozen foods, which suffer fewer losses from farm to shelf.

   • Shop often. Start with a large trip and then make smaller follow-ups
   to buy a few days’ worth of produce at a time.

   • Buy fresh food at local farmers markets.

   Americans spend about as much at restaurants as they do at grocery
   stores.

   • Skip the cafeteria tray. Diners who use trays waste 32 percent more
   than those who carry their plates in their hands.

   • Take home leftovers.

   • Share side dishes to keep portions under control.

   • Ask the waiter to hold extras such as bread and butter you don’t plan
   to eat.

   • Encourage restaurants and caterers to donate leftovers.

   AT HOME

   IN YOUR COMMUNITY

   Small changes in the kitchen can reduce the amount of food your
   household throws out.

   • Use FoodKeeper or other apps for food-expiration reminders.

   • Switch to smaller dishes to control portions. The standard plate is
   36 percent larger than it was 50 years ago.

   • Eat leftovers on a regular night each week.

   • Give uneaten food a second chance. Freeze or can extras. Blend
   bruised fruit into smoothies.

   • Try not to waste water-intensive foods like meat.

   Businesses, schools, nonprofits, and governments can all find ways to
   dump less food.

   • Bring back home economics classes to teach cooking, canning, and
   storage basics.

   • Get your school to join the USDA Food Waste Challenge.

   • Ask your local government for a curbside food-scrap collection
   service like that provided in roughly 200 U.S. communities.

   • Share the bounty of your home garden with your community through
   ampleharvest.org.

   • Use FoodKeeper or other apps for food-expiration reminders.

   • Switch to smaller dishes to control portions. The standard plate is
   36 percent larger than it was 50 years ago.

   • Eat leftovers on a regular night each week.

   • Give uneaten food a second chance. Freeze or can extras. Blend
   bruised fruit into smoothies.

   • Try not to waste water-intensive foods like meat.

   Businesses, schools, nonprofits, and governments can all find ways to
   dump less food.

   • Bring back home economics classes to teach cooking, canning, and
   storage basics.

   • Get your school to join the USDA Food Waste Challenge.

   • Ask your local government for a curbside food-scrap collection
   service like that provided in roughly 200 U.S. communities.

   • Share the bounty of your home garden with your community through
   ampleharvest.org.

   MANUEL CANALES, NGM STAFF

   The possibility spurs a series of calls to his newest friends. “You are
   totally awesome,” he says, hyperenunciating. “Do you think we might be
   able to … It’s outrageous of me to ask but …” What’s the goal of the
   disco soup, besides rescuing food? Raising awareness and building
   community. This squishy stuff works. While gleaning, dicing, and
   dining, chefs from Lima to London have connected with charities hungry
   for their excess; California entrepreneurs have hatched schemes to
   rescue wonky-looking fruit from burial; civil society groups have
   fomented plans for a Kenyan food-rescue network; a Belgian brewer has
   been emboldened to convert stale bread into salable beer.

   A disco soup in Lima seems harebrained, given that Stuart is five hours
   from the city, has a looming appointment at a Colombian banana
   plantation, controls neither a dining room nor a kitchen, and has no
   budget and no food. But history suggests he will probably succeed.

   Stuart, now 38, was born in London, the last of three boys. He lived in
   the city part-time but at 14 took up full-time residence with his
   father in rural East Sussex, where the family kept a large house in
   Ashdown Forest, the model for Winnie-the-Pooh’s Hundred Acre Wood. Just
   across the valley lay what had been his grandparents’ estate, a
   sprawling property with enough farm staff during World War II to field
   a cricket team against the local village. Stuart’s father, Simon, had
   grown up there, and his stories about the farm’s bounty bewitched his
   youngest son.

   Simon Stuart was a talented teacher of English and an outstanding
   naturalist. “We could never learn everything he knew,” Tristram
   recalls. “So my brothers and I split it up. One did birds, another did
   dragonflies, and I did mushrooms.” (Dining on a $22 pizza topped with
   “wild” mushrooms the night before his New York City feast, Stuart
   lights into the waiter. “Your menu is s---. I’m a forager. I know what
   wild mushrooms look like, and these are from a shop.”)

   Salvaging Scraps

   For more than 50 years RC Farms has been collecting Las Vegas kitchen
   waste and plate scrapings, like these zucchini sticks and fries from
   the coffee shop at Jerry’s Nugget Casino. Hauled a short distance to
   Bob and Janet Combs’s third-generation farm, the food scraps will be
   sterilized and fed to 2,500 pigs, replacing more than 800 tons of swine
   feed a year. Portions in U.S. restaurants have increased significantly
   in recent decades, contributing to obesity and food waste.

   Living miles from the nearest town but psychologically close to his
   grandparents’ self-sufficient farm defined Stuart. His father tended a
   large vegetable garden, and Stuart added pigs and chickens to the mix.
   In exchange for manure, Simon gave Tristram his vegetable trimmings.
   “So I had eggs and meat, and I’d go out with my ferrets to catch
   rabbits and shoot deer,” Stuart says. The larder was almost complete.
   Stuart had begun selling pork and eggs to the parents of his
   schoolmates, but he quickly realized that buying animal feed would
   bankrupt him. He started a swill route: collecting misfit potatoes and
   stale cakes from local shops and his school kitchen. He bred his sow,
   Gudrun, and he learned how much edible food the community daily
   discarded.

   Stuart’s environmental consciousness was expanding. At 12, he’d written
   a paper likening the burning of fossil fuels to smoking cigarettes—both
   were self-destructive and addictive. After spending part of a year on a
   French cattle farm, he entered the University of Cambridge, where he
   studied English literature and experienced a cruel uprooting from his
   agro-ecological heaven. The school food was produced “with no attention
   to sustainable criteria,” he says. In response he joined other campus
   activists who were dining on food they’d liberated from supermarket
   Dumpsters. He also drank cider pressed from strangers’ apples, shared
   the roasted brains, rolled spleens, and crisped ears of Gudrun’s many
   offspring, and—after learning they were tasty—slurped snails from
   friends’ gardens.

   It’s not surprising to learn that Stuart once dabbled in theater. “I
   quite liked it,” he says, though it eventually threatened to “get in
   the way of the really important work of saving the planet.” He was
   sufficiently self-aware to realize that privileged students plucking
   unopened tubs of ricotta from rubbish bins had great rhetorical
   potential. At that time, he says, neither supermarkets nor government
   agencies had any overt policies on food waste. That was about to
   change.

   An employee at Las Vegas’s Aria Resort and Casino sorts the edible from
   the inedible. Feeding the scraps to nonruminant animals, such as pigs,
   recycles their nutrients and eliminates some of the methane that food
   would generate in a landfill.

   By 2002 Stuart’s bin diving had attracted enough attention for him to
   help produce a food-waste documentary for a BBC politics show, and
   activists around the world were reaching out to him to partner on food
   rescues. (He was living then in London.) With enough data on where and
   precisely why food was lost throughout the food chain, he realized, he
   might actually be able to do something about it. Thus were sown the
   seeds of his book Waste, in which he investigated the causes and
   environmental toll of food waste around the globe.

   Waste was critically acclaimed, but Stuart knew the data-heavy book
   wouldn’t be read by millions, and he desperately wanted millions to
   support his cause. “Hence, Feeding the 5,000,” he says, echoing Jesus’
   instruction in John 6:12 to “gather the pieces that are left over. Let
   nothing be wasted.” Launched in 2009, Feeding the 5,000 would become
   Stuart’s flagship event—a free public feast made entirely of orphaned
   food. These gatherings have now been replicated in more than 30 cities.
   Thousands partake of the meals, reams of ink and pixels follow, and
   public outcry is amplified. Soon Stuart was giving speeches around the
   world and sharply criticizing the food industry’s most powerful actors,
   many of whom he put on the defensive with his polemics. Supermarkets,
   in turn, considered him “a pain in the ass,” he says. “And I was.”

   From whence does Stuart’s formidable self-confidence spring? One hardly
   knows where to begin. Stuart is ambitious, aggressive, and
   narcissistic. But he’s also eloquent, amusing, and supremely
   knowledgeable on his central topic. “When he speaks, you want to join
   him,” says Dana Gunders, a food-waste specialist with the Natural
   Resources Defense Council who authored the Waste Free Kitchen Handbook.
   “He’s really good at not only kindling that passion in others but
   maintaining it, adding to the army of passionate people who want to do
   something about food waste.”

   At RC Farms, just ten or so miles from the Las Vegas Strip, hogs
   convert surplus potatoes from a local food processor into protein that
   may eventually find its way onto our plates.

   Stuart takes every opportunity to eat low on the hog—the better to keep
   what’s uncoveted from rubbish bins and to model positive behavior. On
   his first morning in Peru he breakfasts on congealed chicken blood.
   “I’ve never had that before,” he says, happily. At lunch he exults in
   guinea pig. On day two he orders beef tripe; on day three, tongue and a
   great deal of pisco. Such is his macho carnivorism that when Stuart
   tells me he’s procured “fried balls” for a hasty airport lunch, I
   assume he’s talking about testicles. They turn out to be relatives of
   the potato knish.

   The protein seems to fortify Stuart for farm and packhouse
   conversations that quickly grow weedy with numbers. Kilos, tons,
   containers, pallets, percentages rejected, recovered, left for dead.
   His stomach for such minutiae is large. “I want to be able to tell
   Europeans that their preference for a closed tip on their asparagus
   equals X million acres of land, X million gallons of water, and X
   million pounds of fertilizer wasted.” He takes a breath. “I need to
   make a headline, to tell people in a concise way that their choices
   matter.”

   Indeed they do. With governments fretting over how to feed more than
   nine billion people by 2050, a dominant narrative calls for increasing
   global food production by 70 to 100 percent. But agriculture already
   represents one of the greatest threats to planetary health. It is
   responsible for 70 percent of the planet’s freshwater withdrawals, 80
   percent of the world’s tropical and subtropical deforestation, and 30
   to 35 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. As the
   population grows and emerging economies develop a taste for meat and
   dairy products, which require huge inputs of grain and other resources
   for relatively little caloric gain, this toll will worsen. But
   converting more wildlands to farm fields may not be necessary, some
   experts say. If we slash waste, change our diet to eat less meat and
   dairy, divert fewer food crops to biofuels, and boost yields on
   underperforming acres, we may be able to feed more than nine billion
   people a healthy diet without trashing more rain forests, plowing up
   more prairies, or wiping out more wetlands.

   Selling Surplus

   Staggered to learn that the U.S. wastes 30 to 40 percent of its food
   while one in seven people suffers from food insecurity, Doug Rauch,
   former president of Trader Joe’s, opened a nonprofit supermarket in
   Dorchester, Massachusetts. Called Daily Table, the supermarket sells
   discounted fruits and vegetables that are about to be discarded because
   they’re too close to peak freshness; it also sells inexpensive surplus
   goods and prepares healthy to-go meals. “Hunger and wasted food,” Rauch
   says, “are two problems that can have one solution.”

   Stuart never loses sight of this big picture, but he knows that
   paradigm changes are incremental. And so he stands in the desert behind
   an Ica packinghouse, hammering away at Luis Torres, general manager of
   Shuman Produce Peru. Lacking a local market for what he cannot export,
   Torres annually dumps 3.5 million pounds of small or imperfectly
   spherical onions. But he’s reluctant to blame buyers for this loss.

   “If I complain, the supermarket will find a new farmer,” he says,
   shrugging. “I am a practical person. I can do nothing to change the
   rules.”

   Standing with his feet spread and arms crossed, Stuart replies, “I
   can.”

   Three years ago Stuart spent a week running around the Kenyan
   countryside, hunting down ingredients for a formal dinner in Nairobi
   where the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) would highlight
   the problem of food waste. A hundred miles from the capital, he met a
   farmer forced by European cosmetic standards to reject 40 tons a week
   of green beans, broccoli, sugar snap peas, and runner beans—enough food
   to serve 250,000 people. Within a year Stuart and a camera crew
   returned to Kenya and discovered that farmers were grading out nearly
   half of their harvest in fields and packhouses, with green bean farmers
   losing even more product by trimming both the tips and the tails of
   each surviving bean. Supermarkets also routinely canceled orders at the
   last minute without compensating the farmers. After Feedback publicized
   images of the rejected beans and accused major supermarket chains of
   transferring their costs to relatively powerless growers, U.K. grocers
   were ready to talk. They eventually agreed to bear the cost of order
   cancellations and to expand the length of their packaging, which
   allowed green beans to be trimmed at only one end. Not only would less
   food and fewer resources be wasted, but farmers might also be able to
   plant fewer acres.

   “Tristram identified a problem, and he did something about it,” says
   Clementine O’Connor, a consultant on sustainable food to the UNEP.
   “He’s been a lone voice defending farmers from unfair trading
   practices, identifying barriers, and catalyzing action, often in cases
   where supermarkets and governments were not aware of the problem.”

   Eating Ugly

   Imperfect, a start-up based in Emeryville, California, buys
   outré-looking produce from farmers and delivers it, at low cost, to
   more than a thousand San Francisco Bay Area subscribers. U.S. and
   European retail chains also have had success selling odd-looking fruits
   and vegetables at discount. “We’re redefining beauty, not taste,” says
   Ron Clark, an Imperfect founder.

   Feedback’s 2015 report on Kenyan green beans was just one achievement
   in a watershed year. By the end of 2015 the UN and the U.S. had pledged
   to halve food waste by 2030. The exact mechanisms of this ambitious
   goal haven’t been spelled out. But already countries and companies are
   devising and adopting standardized metrics to quantify waste. If the
   target is met, enough food could be saved to feed at least one billion
   people.

   On an overcast Thursday afternoon in September, Stuart strides through
   a muddy field in northern France. He plunges his hands into a mound of
   soil and extracts several thin-skinned potatoes, which, being the size
   of thimbles and thumbs, had slipped through the mechanical harvester’s
   grasp. For the next hour and a half he and a team of gleaners comb
   through the soil. The goal is to gather 1,100 pounds of spuds for
   Sunday’s Feeding the 5,000 event, to be held in Paris’s locus of civic
   activism, the stately Place de la République. The next day Stuart and
   another team of volunteers from partner organizations wash their
   enormous haul in a ramshackle squat in the 12th arrondissement.
   Standing shirtless in a cluttered room redolent of sweat and pot, with
   music blasting, Stuart scolds a woman for wasting time by scrubbing the
   potatoes twice. Feeling bullied, she blurts a two-word vulgarism.
   Stuart crows, “That’s what everyone says to me!”

   On Saturday it’s time to chop. Gathering at rows of plastic tables in
   the square, hundreds of volunteers come and go over a period of four
   hours, dicing roughly 3,900 pounds of potatoes, eggplants, carrots, and
   red peppers—some gleaned from farms, some donated by the Rungis
   wholesale market. Mostly veterans of mass production, the helpers
   shuttle produce from crates to giant plastic bowls and then to blue
   plastic bags. At 5 a.m. on Sunday the chef, Peter O’Grady, a Hare
   Krishna who runs a charity kitchen in London, tips those bags into
   chest-high metal tanks atop gas burners.

   As midday approaches, the park grows crowded. Musicians perform
   onstage, and two-legged carrots and eggplants parade and chant, “No
   more vegetable waste!” Stuart is absent, his presence superfluous. As
   6,100 diners begin to queue up, the servers don gloves, hats, and
   aprons. At noon Stuart materializes. He mounts the stage and grabs the
   mike. He thanks everyone who made the banquet possible, calls food
   waste a scandal, briefly links agriculture to climate change, then
   withdraws from the stage. But not before shouting, “Bon appétit.”

   Feeding a Need

   At the Benning Park Community Center in Washington, D.C., third-grader
   Kevin Boyd eats an after-school dinner provided by DC Central Kitchen,
   a nonprofit that trains chefs and provides 11,000 meals a day in
   shelters, schools, and other locations. Almost half these meals come
   from food that would otherwise have gone to waste. At the center the
   students do their homework and learn how to make healthy meals, such as
   smoothies and homemade granola. “I always tell him, Don’t say you don’t
   like it until you try it,” says Kevin's mother, Antoinette Boyd.

One million species at risk of extinction, UN report warns

A landmark global assessment warns that the window is closing to safeguard
biodiversity and a healthy planet. Yet solutions are in sight.

   5 Minute Read

   PUBLISHED May 6, 2019

   The bonds that hold nature together may be at risk of unraveling from
   deforestation, overfishing, development, and other human activities, a
   landmark United Nations report warns. Thanks to human pressures, one
   million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years, with
   serious consequences for human beings as well as the rest of life on
   Earth.

   “The evidence is crystal clear: Nature is in trouble. Therefore we are
   in trouble,” said Sandra Díaz, one of the co-chairs of the Global
   Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. A 40-page
   “Summary for Policy Makers” of the forthcoming full report (expected to
   exceed 1,500 pages) was released May 6 in Paris.

   Based on a review of about 15,000 scientific and government sources and
   compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries, the global report is
   the first comprehensive look in 15 years at the state of the planet’s
   biodiversity. This report includes, for the first time, indigenous and
   local knowledge as well as scientific studies. The authors say they
   found overwhelming evidence that human activities are behind nature’s
   decline. They ranked the major drivers of species decline as land
   conversion, including deforestation; overfishing; bush meat hunting and
   poaching; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species.

   The tremendous variety of living species—at least 8.7 million, but
   possibly many more—that make up our “life-supporting safety net”
   provide our food, clean water, air, energy, and more, said Díaz, an
   ecologist at the National University of Cordoba in Argentina, in an
   interview. “Not only is our safety net shrinking, it’s becoming more
   threadbare and holes are appearing.”

A world of green slime?

   In parts of the ocean, little life remains but green slime. Some remote
   tropical forests are nearly silent as insects have vanished, and
   grasslands are increasingly becoming deserts. Human activity has
   resulted in the severe alteration of more than 75 percent of Earth’s
   land areas, the Global Assessment found. And 66 percent of the oceans,
   which cover most of our blue planet, have suffered significant human
   impacts. This includes more than 400 dead zones—where scant life can
   survive—that collectively would cover the state of Oregon or Wyoming.

   The new report paints “an ominous picture” of the health of ecosystems
   rapidly deteriorating, said Sir Robert Watson, Chair of the
   Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services (IPBES), which conducted the global assessment. IPBES is often
   described as the equivalent of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate
   Change for biodiversity and does scientific assessments on the status
   of the non-human life that makes up the Earth’s life-support system.

   “We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods,
   food security, health, and quality of life worldwide,” Watson said in a
   statement.

   “My biggest personal concern is the state of the oceans,” Watson told
   National Geographic. “Plastics, dead zones, overfishing,
   acidification... We’re really screwing up the oceans in a big way.”

Saving more species

   Protecting nature and saving species is all about securing the land and
   water plants and animals need to survive, said Jonathan Baillie,
   executive vice president and chief scientist of the National Geographic
   Society. Protecting half of the planet by 2050, with an interim target
   of 30 percent by 2030, is the only way to meet the Paris climate
   targets or achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for the
   world, Baillie said.

   Forests, oceans, and other parts of nature soak up 60 percent of global
   fossil fuel emissions every year, the report found. “We need to secure
   the biosphere to protect the climate and help buffer us from extreme
   weather events,” Baillie said.

   Coral reefs and mangroves protect coastal areas from storms such as
   hurricanes. Wetlands reduce flooding by absorbing heavy rainfall. Yet
   each of these ecosystems has declined dramatically, with wetlands down
   to less than 15 percent of what they were 300 years ago and coral reefs
   facing a global bleaching crisis.

   Nearly 100 groups around the world (including the National Geographic
   Society and the Wyss Campaign for Nature) have endorsed the goal of
   protecting half of the planet by 2050. Recently, 19 of the world’s
   leading scientists published a study to make a science-backed plan for
   an interim step that would protect 30 percent by 2030 under what’s
   called a Global Deal for Nature. The proposed protection does not mean
   “no go” areas, but rather areas protected from resource extraction and
   land conversion. Sustainable uses would be permitted in all but the
   most sensitive areas, the groups wrote.

   “The international community has both the time and the tools to
   safeguard nature and slow the ongoing wildlife extinction crisis,”
   Brian O’Donnell, director of the Wyss Campaign for Nature, said in a
   statement.

   National Geographic Society and the Wyss Campaign for Nature are
   working together to inspire the protection of 30 percent of the planet
   by 2030.

   Such tools were under discussion during the week-long negotiations by
   IPBES country members who debated the key messages and policy options
   to be published in the “Summary for Policymakers.” The full Global
   Assessment report will be published later this year.

   “The main message of our report is that transformative change is
   urgently needed. There are no other options” said David Obura, a marine
   biologist at the Coastal Oceans Research and Development – Indian Ocean
   in Mombasa, Kenya. “There’s so little time left to save corals. If we
   can save corals we could save everything.”

Value nature not stuff

   In order to safeguard a healthy planet, society needs to shift from a
   sole focus on chasing economic growth, the summary report concludes.
   That won’t be easy, the report acknowledges. But it could get easier if
   countries begin to base their economies on an understanding that nature
   is the foundation for development. Shifting to nature-based planning
   can help provide a better quality of life with far less impact.

   Putting that concept into practical terms, the report says countries
   need to reform hundreds of billions in dollars in subsidies and
   incentives that are currently given to the energy, fishing,
   agricultural, and forestry sectors. Instead of driving additional
   exploitation of the world’s natural resources, those monies should be
   shifted to incentivize protection and restoration of nature—such as
   underwriting new reserves or reforestation programs, the report said.

   “We need to change what we value: nature, ecosystems, social equity,
   not growing the GDP,” Obura said.
   Three New Marine Parks Protect Stunning Biodiversity

   The other evidence gathered by IPBES shows that nature managed by
   indigenous peoples and local communities is in generally better health
   than nature managed by national or corporate institutions, despite
   increasing pressures, said Joji Cariño, a senior policy advisor at the
   Forest Peoples Programme, a human rights organization.

   At least a quarter of the global land area is traditionally owned,
   managed, used, or occupied by indigenous peoples. However, their land
   tenure and other rights are not always protected or recognized by all
   countries. Nor is their deep knowledge of the land and their values
   often considered in policies and decisions by governments. That needs
   to change, the Global Assessment noted.

   “Indigenous peoples are key partners in the global transformation
   that’s needed,” said Cariño.

   Yet countries still are slow to recognize this, she adds. As an
   example, she points to the Philippines. Forty years ago, indigenous
   people there stopped construction of dams on the Chico River because
   they were concerned about impacts on their land. Yet those dams are now
   being built by China under their trillion-dollar Belt and Road
   infrastructure initiative.

   China has an important role to play in global discussions around
   biodiversity, because the country will host a major United Nations
   conference called the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in late
   2020. Scientists hope a new, ambitious international agreement to
   protect the planet could happen there, akin to the Paris agreement
   around climate.

   Assessment co-chair Díaz doesn’t yet know if a global agreement will
   arise as bold as protecting 30 percent by 2030. “If it were easy it
   would have already happened,” Diaz said.

   “However, the evidence is clear: the future will be bad for us if we
   don’t act now. There is no future for us without nature.”

This island is going trash free—by recycling all of its waste

The Danish island of Bornholm has an aging incinerator that will soon need
replacement. Instead, the local government is adopting a totally new system.

     Society.

   Imagine a whole community reusing or recycling every last scrap of
   waste. That may sound utopian, but perhaps not on the Danish island of
   Bornholm.

   By 2032 all waste on Bornholm will be treated as resources, say
   officials. Garbage sorting, recycling, minimizing waste, and a lot of
   new technology are the tools envisioned to turn Bornholm into one of
   the first garbage-free communities on the planet.

   Bornholm, the easternmost island of Denmark, is a 227 square-mile (588
   square-kilometer) granite rock jutting out of the Baltic Sea. Known for
   its quaint fishing villages and sunny climate, it is a popular vacation
   destination with a permanent population of 40,000 and another 600,000
   annual visitors.

   “By 2032 we aim to reuse or recycle everything,” says Jens
   Hjul-Nielsen, CEO of BOFA, the island’s waste management company and
   key architect behind the garbage-free vision. “How we get to that point
   is an exciting process, because there is so much we don’t yet know. We
   have a vision, but no clear-cut plan on how to get there.”

   As the island’s only waste-incineration facility is wearing out, the
   bold decision was made last December to close it down in 2032 and make
   the transition towards a garbage-free society.

   “Operating a waste management company on such a small scale as we do
   here has its challenges, so instead of investing in a new incineration
   facility, we decided to simply eliminate landfill and incineration as
   waste management options. We wanted to try something different and
   utilize that we are a society in miniature, complete with businesses,
   private households and tourism, where we can experiment and gain
   knowledge that later may be scaled up to a national or even a global
   level,” explains Hjul-Nielsen.

The vision

   In BOFA’s vision of the future, the citizens of Bornholm will sort all
   their waste into different fractions, easy to collect and use in new
   resource loops. Metal, plastics, glass, paper, and cardboard are widely
   recycled, and new waste fractions such as fishing nets and insulation
   materials will be added to the sorting and recycling system. Meanwhile,
   organic waste will be converted into energy together with green garden
   and park waste, while the nutrient-rich residue from the energy
   extraction is used as fertilizer in fields, parks and gardens, writes
   BOFA.

   In this circular economy, the inhabitants will reuse everything from
   furniture to children’s clothing and make use of sharing economy
   services—for instance lending, renting, or bartering goods through the
   internet or peer communities.

   In elementary schools children will be educated as “resource heroes”
   with practical lessons in waste, resources, the environment, and
   nature. And a university research center on models of green transition
   and the circular economy will be established on Bornholm.

The “Green Island”

   It was a unanimous municipal council that decided to close the
   incineration facility and embrace this bold vision back in December.

   But a green mind-set is not new to the local government. The
   municipality already adopted a “Bright Green Island” strategy to
   position itself as a leader in sustainable development, aiming to be
   CO2-neutral by 2025, convert to green energy sources, and expand the
   island’s organic farm land.

   “Yet, in the waste area we were lagging behind, so it was important for
   us to move ahead in this sector as well,” says Anne Thomas, the deputy
   mayor of Bornholm.

   “As a first-mover in this kind of area, you can benefit from
   development funding from national and international sources like the
   EU,” she adds. “As a last-mover you benefit from all the
   trial-and-error that has gone before, and the technology is far cheaper
   to implement. Being in the middle field is the really heavy place to
   be. For us, the decision to be first-movers here was not a difficult
   one.”

The transition

   Today, Bornholm recycles 39 percent of its household waste. The first
   step to becoming garbage-free is to increase this number, so that far
   more waste is sorted, recycled, and reused. That is in itself a huge
   task, “yet we know how to do all of this,” says Thomas.

   “The really exciting stuff comes in the second phase where we shall be
   exploring new ways of working with companies, changing production
   processes, engaging the population, and testing new methods for waste
   management.”

   Looking ahead to the final phase of transition, things become more
   uncertain, notes Hjul-Nielsen. “After all, we don’t even know what kind
   of waste there will be in the future—some types of material that need
   special handling now may be banned by then, or new materials may have
   been invented. The door can swing both ways, making our work easier or
   harder,” he says.

   New technology will play an important part in meeting those challenges.
   BOFA is counting on attracting companies interested in testing new
   technology in a small arena like Bornholm before rolling it out on a
   larger scale—for instance new methods of breaking down and treating
   materials that are not available today. “And just four months in, we
   are already seeing an interest from some really major companies,” says
   the CEO.

The people

   Even so, new technology alone will not drive the change.

   The involvement and good will of the population will be a critical
   factor, emphasizes Jens Hjul-Nielsen. “As the interest in
   sustainability is gaining ground we are already on the winning team, as
   long as it doesn’t become expensive or difficult for people to deal
   with in their everyday lives. If it does, we might lose them.”

   As it is now, the citizens of Bornholm pay a waste disposal tax to the
   municipality of approximately 3000 Danish kroner ($454 USD) a year per
   household for all waste management, including a weekly collection and
   treatment service (if you have less waste, you may opt for a
   fortnightly service).

   To finance the first step of extending the sorted waste to seven
   fractions—food, glass, metal, paper, cardboard, plastic, and wood—the
   local government has approved a waste disposal tax increase of 15
   percent, adding $68 USD to each household’s annual tax from 2022. This
   step is in compliance with a nationwide policy that 50 percent of all
   household waste must be sorted into the seven fractions for recycling
   by 2022.

   “The next step of becoming fully garbage-free is to be funded by
   internal reprioritization as well as external sources and
   collaborators. If this doesn’t suffice, we are budgeting with a maximal
   additional tax increase of one to two percent annually, or about $4.5
   to $11 USD per household,” says Hjul-Nielsen.

   BOFA is involved in an array of projects to engage the general public
   and the private sector in the transition. For example, one project is
   looking at different types of households—a fishing village with many
   tourists, a complex of townhouses, a small farming village—to
   understand the challenges of sorting and minimizing waste in different
   living situations and find the best solutions and ways of motivating
   people.

   Other projects aim to encourage the production of goods with
   replaceable parts and reduce packaging, produce information material
   and explore—in dialogue with the tourist industry—the best ways to help
   visitors understand and use the sorting system.

Leading the way

   “I meet a keen interest in correct waste management out there. A lot of
   villages and communities on Bornholm are already working towards a
   greener future and sharing their ideas with each other,” says the
   deputy mayor. “Transitioning to a circular economy is not just a
   question of buying more garbage cans, it’s about new methods and new
   behavior, a whole new way of thinking.”

   But what if the island hasn’t realized its goal of being entirely
   garbage-free by 2032—is there a plan B?

   We are committed to the long-term goal, even if it takes slightly
   longer to get there than planned, says Jens Hjul-Nielsen. “If we still
   have a small amount of residual waste left by 2032, well, then we will
   send that for incineration at a facility off island and that will be
   the project to solve for 2033—but we will still have taken a huge step
   forward compared to where we are today.”

How ‘Ugly’ Fruits and Vegetables Can Help Solve World Hunger

About a third of the planet’s food goes to waste, often because of its looks.
That’s enough to feed two billion people.

   PUBLISHED March 2016

   Tristram Stuart has 24 hours to produce a restaurant meal for 50
   people—to plan a menu, gather food, then welcome guests to a venue in a
   city not his own. Complicating what sounds like a reality-show contest
   is a singular rule: Nearly all the ingredients must be sourced from
   farms and vendors intending to throw them out.

   After racing back to New York City from a New Jersey farm where he
   gleaned 75 pounds of crookneck squash deemed by the farmers too crooked
   to sell, Stuart bolts from a car creeping through traffic and darts
   into a Greenwich Village bakery. Tall and blond, with a posh English
   accent, he launches into his ten-second spiel: “I run an organization
   that campaigns against food waste, and I’m pulling together a feast
   tomorrow made with food that won’t be sold or donated to charity. Do
   you have any bread that we could use?” The bakery doesn’t, but the
   clerk hands him two broken chocolate-chip cookies as consolation.

   Stuart flings himself into the car. His next stop: the Union Square
   farmers market, where he spies a chef wrapping fish in squares of
   brioche dough, then trimming them into half circles. “Can I have your
   corners?” Stuart asks, with a meant-to-be-charming smile. The chef,
   uncharmed, declines. He’s going to make use of this dough himself.
   Undaunted, Stuart sails on through the market, delivering his pitch and
   eventually procuring discarded beet greens, wheatgrass, and apples.

   Near Apartadó, Colombia, activist Tristram Stuart examines bananas too
   short, long, or curved for the European market. Locals consume some
   rejected bananas, but growers in the region annually dump millions of
   tons of edible fruit.

   Eighteen hours later scores of chefs, food-recovery experts, and
   activists talk shop over chef Celia Lam’s squash tempura, turnip and
   tofu dumplings, and spiralized zucchini noodles. Stuart himself had
   cooked very little, but he had, without a single formal meeting,
   ensorcelled a half dozen people to devise a menu, gather ingredients,
   and then prep, cook, serve, and clean up a meal for little more than
   the chance to be associated with one of the most compelling figures in
   the international fight against food waste.

   Across cultures, food waste goes against the moral grain. After all,
   nearly 800 million people worldwide suffer from hunger. But according
   to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we
   squander enough food—globally, 2.9 trillion pounds a year—to feed every
   one of them more than twice over. Where’s all that food—about a third
   of the planet’s production—going? In developing nations much is lost
   postharvest for lack of adequate storage facilities, good roads, and
   refrigeration. In comparison, developed nations waste more food farther
   down the supply chain, when retailers order, serve, or display too much
   and when consumers ignore leftovers in the back of the fridge or toss
   perishables before they’ve expired.

   Wasting food takes an environmental toll as well. Producing food that
   no one eats—whether sausages or snickerdoodles—also squanders the
   water, fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, fuel, and land needed to grow it.
   The quantities aren’t trivial. Globally a year’s production of uneaten
   food guzzles as much water as the entire annual flow of the Volga,
   Europe’s most voluminous river. Growing the 133 billion pounds of food
   that retailers and consumers discard in the United States annually
   slurps the equivalent of more than 70 times the amount of oil lost in
   the Gulf of Mexico’s Deepwater Horizon disaster, according to American
   Wasteland author Jonathan Bloom. These staggering numbers don’t even
   include the losses from farms, fishing vessels, and slaughterhouses. If
   food waste were a country, it would be the third largest producer of
   greenhouse gases in the world, after China and the U.S. On a planet of
   finite resources, with the expectation of at least two billion more
   residents by 2050, this profligacy, Stuart argues in his book Waste:
   Uncovering the Global Food Scandal, is obscene.

   At a Paris feast chefs simmer cosmetically challenged veggies—gleaned
   or donated—into a curry for 6,100 anti-waste enthusiasts.

   Others have been making similar arguments for years, but reducing food
   waste has become a matter of international urgency. Some U.S. schools,
   where children dump up to 40 percent of their lunches into the trash,
   are setting up sharing tables, letting students serve themselves
   portions they know they’ll eat, allotting more time for lunch, and
   scheduling it after recess—all proven methods of boosting consumption.
   Countless businesses, such as grocery stores, restaurants, and
   cafeterias, have stepped forward to combat waste by quantifying how
   much edible food isn’t consumed, optimizing their purchasing, shrinking
   portion sizes, and beefing up efforts to move excess to charities.
   Stuart himself has made a specialty of investigating conditions farther
   up the supply chain, where supermarket standards and ordering practices
   lead to massive, but mostly hidden, dumps of edible food.

   Fifty miles north of Lima, Peru, in the farming town of Huaral, Stuart
   sips a glass of freshly squeezed satsuma juice with Luis Garibaldi,
   whose Fundo Maria Luisa is the largest grower of mandarins in the
   country. Pitched forward in his seat under a poolside pergola, Stuart
   asks: How much do you export? How much is rejected? For what reason?
   And what happens to those discards? Seventy percent of his crop,
   Garibaldi says, is exported to the European Union and North America.
   But 30 percent won’t be the right size, color, or sweetness, or it
   might have blemishes, scars, scratches, sunburn, fungus, or spiders. To
   local markets most of these rejects go, netting Garibaldi just
   one-third the price of the exports.

   Stuart works through a ladder of queries that lead to a general thesis:
   Supermarkets’ cosmetic standards are crazily exacting—until supply
   shrinks, at which point they crumble like a chocolate lattice.
   Lost En Route
   Every year some 2.9 trillion pounds of food—about a third of all that
   the world produces—never get consumed. Along the supply chain fruits
   and vegetables are lost or wasted at higher rates than other foods.
   Easily bruised and vulnerable to temperature swings en route from farm
   to table, they’re also usually the first to get tossed at home.

   “So grocers purchase this slightly imperfect fruit, and consumers still
   buy it?” Stuart asks.

   “Yes,” Garibaldi says, nodding.

   In the fragrant orchard, which lies in a valley under the parched
   crenellations of the Cordilleran foothills, Stuart plucks a mandarin
   unfit for any market but stops short of eating it. “I don’t mind
   maggots, actually, but that one was fermented,” he says, choosing
   instead a fruit with two tiny brown spots. Fundo Maria Luisa, it turns
   out, generates relatively little waste, thanks to its U.K.
   representative, who examines shipments and negotiates with any buyers
   poised to reject fruit for specious reasons. Often, Garibaldi says, a
   supermarket’s rejection of food for cosmetic reasons is merely a
   cover-up for its inaccurate forecasts or an unexpected drop in sales.
   Either way, the grower is expected to eat the loss.

   Thirty percent of the mandarin crop in Huaral, Peru, won’t meet
   exacting export standards. Most of the rejects will be eaten locally.
   Globally 46 percent of fruits and vegetables never make it from farm to
   fork.

   We drive 200 miles south, past tall sand dunes and wind-eroded ridges.
   All is ocher and dust until we reach valleys suddenly verdant with
   irrigated farmland—a consequence of foreign investment, favorable trade
   agreements, cheap labor, a warm climate, and a once bountiful aquifer.
   In the Ica Region, Stuart interviews a farmer who annually abandons in
   his fields millions of stalks of asparagus too thin or too curved or
   with bud tips slightly too open to export. Next a producer tells him
   that he dumps more than a thousand tons of infinitesimally imperfect
   Minneola tangelos and a hundred tons of grapefruit a year into a
   sandpit behind his packhouse.

   Grade standards—industry driven and voluntary—were devised long ago to
   provide growers and buyers with a common language for evaluating
   produce and mediating disputes. They also can help reduce food waste.
   If growers can sort their asparagus or tangelos into established
   grades, they stand a better chance of finding markets for their
   “seconds.” Supermarkets have always been free to set their own
   standards, of course, but in recent years upscale grocers have started
   running their produce departments like beauty pageants, responding to
   customers, they say, who expect only platonically ideal produce: apples
   round and shiny, asparagus straight and tightly budded.

   “It’s all about quality and appearance,” says Rick Stein, vice
   president of fresh foods at the Food Marketing Institute. “And only the
   best appearance will capture share of the consumer’s wallet.” Some of
   the produce that doesn’t capture share will be donated to food banks or
   chopped up and used in a supermarket’s prepared meals or salad bar, but
   most of U.S. grocers’ excess food is neither donated nor recycled.
   Stuart applauds some U.S. and EU supermarkets’ recent campaigns to sell
   “ugly” produce at a discount, but he prefers a systemic fix. “It would
   be far better to simply relax the standards,” he says, surveying a sea
   of abandoned Peruvian citrus for which no secondary market—ugly or
   otherwise—exists.

   Gleaning for Good

   In the Picardy region of France a volunteer helps glean 1,100 pounds of
   potatoes too small to harvest mechanically. The potatoes will join
   carrots, eggplants, and other gleaned and donated vegetables at Paris’s
   Place de la République. There volunteers allied with Stuart’s group
   Feedback will chop this bounty into a meal for 6,100 diners. Feedback
   has helped organize more than 30 of these public feasts around the
   world to raise awareness of food waste and inspire local solutions.

   For seven days Stuart traipses around farms and packhouses, runs
   through his questions, gathers data, and samples rejects. Between
   visits he folds himself like a fruit bat into the backseat of a crowded
   car and types. Tap, tap. He’s working out logistics for his next
   research trip, then accepting a drinks invitation from the general
   manager of the Food Bank of Peru. Tap, tap. An appointment with a food
   rescuer who just flew up from Santiago, Chile. Everywhere he goes, it
   seems, people want to tell Stuart an egregious story about food waste.

   Sleep-deprived, unshaven, and sometimes hungover—what’s the point of
   being in a new country if you can’t sample what’s locally
   fermented?—Stuart remains focused. In fume-choked traffic he arranges
   to meet with a Peruvian congressman trying to overturn tax laws that
   incentivize dumping excess food over donating it. As we careen down a
   serpentine road, he taps out revisions to a proposed
   food-waste-reduction bill in the U.K. Parliament and a letter in
   support of expanding the authority of the U.K.’s Groceries Code
   Adjudicator. Next he floats to colleagues the idea of a Lima “disco
   soup”—a communal meal of rejected food, similar to the feast in New
   York City—to be held in four days for 50 to 100 people.

   Reducing Waste: How You Can Help

   Developed countries are responsible for most of the food left uneaten
   on grocery-store shelves, on restaurant plates, and in home
   refrigerators. Here are some tips to reduce your waste footprint.

   AT A STORE

   AT A RESTAURANT

   Make careful decisions about what and how much you buy at the grocery
   store.

   • Shop at stores that offer misshapen food at a discount.

   • Purchase prepared meals at the deli or salad bar, which allows
   supermarkets to make use of imperfect produce.

   • Buy frozen foods, which suffer fewer losses from farm to shelf.

   • Shop often. Start with a large trip and then make smaller follow-ups
   to buy a few days’ worth of produce at a time.

   • Buy fresh food at local farmers markets.

   Americans spend about as much at restaurants as they do at grocery
   stores.

   • Skip the cafeteria tray. Diners who use trays waste 32 percent more
   than those who carry their plates in their hands.

   • Take home leftovers.

   • Share side dishes to keep portions under control.

   • Ask the waiter to hold extras such as bread and butter you don’t plan
   to eat.

   • Encourage restaurants and caterers to donate leftovers.

   AT HOME

   IN YOUR COMMUNITY

   Small changes in the kitchen can reduce the amount of food your
   household throws out.

   • Use FoodKeeper or other apps for food-expiration reminders.

   • Switch to smaller dishes to control portions. The standard plate is
   36 percent larger than it was 50 years ago.

   • Eat leftovers on a regular night each week.

   • Give uneaten food a second chance. Freeze or can extras. Blend
   bruised fruit into smoothies.

   • Try not to waste water-intensive foods like meat.

   Businesses, schools, nonprofits, and governments can all find ways to
   dump less food.

   • Bring back home economics classes to teach cooking, canning, and
   storage basics.

   • Get your school to join the USDA Food Waste Challenge.

   • Ask your local government for a curbside food-scrap collection
   service like that provided in roughly 200 U.S. communities.

   • Share the bounty of your home garden with your community through
   ampleharvest.org.

   The possibility spurs a series of calls to his newest friends. “You are
   totally awesome,” he says, hyperenunciating. “Do you think we might be
   able to … It’s outrageous of me to ask but …” What’s the goal of the
   disco soup, besides rescuing food? Raising awareness and building
   community. This squishy stuff works. While gleaning, dicing, and
   dining, chefs from Lima to London have connected with charities hungry
   for their excess; California entrepreneurs have hatched schemes to
   rescue wonky-looking fruit from burial; civil society groups have
   fomented plans for a Kenyan food-rescue network; a Belgian brewer has
   been emboldened to convert stale bread into salable beer.

   A disco soup in Lima seems harebrained, given that Stuart is five hours
   from the city, has a looming appointment at a Colombian banana
   plantation, controls neither a dining room nor a kitchen, and has no
   budget and no food. But history suggests he will probably succeed.

   Stuart, now 38, was born in London, the last of three boys. He lived in
   the city part-time but at 14 took up full-time residence with his
   father in rural East Sussex, where the family kept a large house in
   Ashdown Forest, the model for Winnie-the-Pooh’s Hundred Acre Wood. Just
   across the valley lay what had been his grandparents’ estate, a
   sprawling property with enough farm staff during World War II to field
   a cricket team against the local village. Stuart’s father, Simon, had
   grown up there, and his stories about the farm’s bounty bewitched his
   youngest son.

   Simon Stuart was a talented teacher of English and an outstanding
   naturalist. “We could never learn everything he knew,” Tristram
   recalls. “So my brothers and I split it up. One did birds, another did
   dragonflies, and I did mushrooms.” (Dining on a $22 pizza topped with
   “wild” mushrooms the night before his New York City feast, Stuart
   lights into the waiter. “Your menu is s---. I’m a forager. I know what
   wild mushrooms look like, and these are from a shop.”)

   Salvaging Scraps

   For more than 50 years RC Farms has been collecting Las Vegas kitchen
   waste and plate scrapings, like these zucchini sticks and fries from
   the coffee shop at Jerry’s Nugget Casino. Hauled a short distance to
   Bob and Janet Combs’s third-generation farm, the food scraps will be
   sterilized and fed to 2,500 pigs, replacing more than 800 tons of swine
   feed a year. Portions in U.S. restaurants have increased significantly
   in recent decades, contributing to obesity and food waste.

   Living miles from the nearest town but psychologically close to his
   grandparents’ self-sufficient farm defined Stuart. His father tended a
   large vegetable garden, and Stuart added pigs and chickens to the mix.
   In exchange for manure, Simon gave Tristram his vegetable trimmings.
   “So I had eggs and meat, and I’d go out with my ferrets to catch
   rabbits and shoot deer,” Stuart says. The larder was almost complete.
   Stuart had begun selling pork and eggs to the parents of his
   schoolmates, but he quickly realized that buying animal feed would
   bankrupt him. He started a swill route: collecting misfit potatoes and
   stale cakes from local shops and his school kitchen. He bred his sow,
   Gudrun, and he learned how much edible food the community daily
   discarded.

   Stuart’s environmental consciousness was expanding. At 12, he’d written
   a paper likening the burning of fossil fuels to smoking cigarettes—both
   were self-destructive and addictive. After spending part of a year on a
   French cattle farm, he entered the University of Cambridge, where he
   studied English literature and experienced a cruel uprooting from his
   agro-ecological heaven. The school food was produced “with no attention
   to sustainable criteria,” he says. In response he joined other campus
   activists who were dining on food they’d liberated from supermarket
   Dumpsters. He also drank cider pressed from strangers’ apples, shared
   the roasted brains, rolled spleens, and crisped ears of Gudrun’s many
   offspring, and—after learning they were tasty—slurped snails from
   friends’ gardens.

   It’s not surprising to learn that Stuart once dabbled in theater. “I
   quite liked it,” he says, though it eventually threatened to “get in
   the way of the really important work of saving the planet.” He was
   sufficiently self-aware to realize that privileged students plucking
   unopened tubs of ricotta from rubbish bins had great rhetorical
   potential. At that time, he says, neither supermarkets nor government
   agencies had any overt policies on food waste. That was about to
   change.

   An employee at Las Vegas’s Aria Resort and Casino sorts the edible from
   the inedible. Feeding the scraps to nonruminant animals, such as pigs,
   recycles their nutrients and eliminates some of the methane that food
   would generate in a landfill.

   By 2002 Stuart’s bin diving had attracted enough attention for him to
   help produce a food-waste documentary for a BBC politics show, and
   activists around the world were reaching out to him to partner on food
   rescues. (He was living then in London.) With enough data on where and
   precisely why food was lost throughout the food chain, he realized, he
   might actually be able to do something about it. Thus were sown the
   seeds of his book Waste, in which he investigated the causes and
   environmental toll of food waste around the globe.

   Waste was critically acclaimed, but Stuart knew the data-heavy book
   wouldn’t be read by millions, and he desperately wanted millions to
   support his cause. “Hence, Feeding the 5,000,” he says, echoing Jesus’
   instruction in John 6:12 to “gather the pieces that are left over. Let
   nothing be wasted.” Launched in 2009, Feeding the 5,000 would become
   Stuart’s flagship event—a free public feast made entirely of orphaned
   food. These gatherings have now been replicated in more than 30 cities.
   Thousands partake of the meals, reams of ink and pixels follow, and
   public outcry is amplified. Soon Stuart was giving speeches around the
   world and sharply criticizing the food industry’s most powerful actors,
   many of whom he put on the defensive with his polemics. Supermarkets,
   in turn, considered him “a pain in the ass,” he says. “And I was.”

   From whence does Stuart’s formidable self-confidence spring? One hardly
   knows where to begin. Stuart is ambitious, aggressive, and
   narcissistic. But he’s also eloquent, amusing, and supremely
   knowledgeable on his central topic. “When he speaks, you want to join
   him,” says Dana Gunders, a food-waste specialist with the Natural
   Resources Defense Council who authored the Waste Free Kitchen Handbook.
   “He’s really good at not only kindling that passion in others but
   maintaining it, adding to the army of passionate people who want to do
   something about food waste.”

   At RC Farms, just ten or so miles from the Las Vegas Strip, hogs
   convert surplus potatoes from a local food processor into protein that
   may eventually find its way onto our plates.

   Stuart takes every opportunity to eat low on the hog—the better to keep
   what’s uncoveted from rubbish bins and to model positive behavior. On
   his first morning in Peru he breakfasts on congealed chicken blood.
   “I’ve never had that before,” he says, happily. At lunch he exults in
   guinea pig. On day two he orders beef tripe; on day three, tongue and a
   great deal of pisco. Such is his macho carnivorism that when Stuart
   tells me he’s procured “fried balls” for a hasty airport lunch, I
   assume he’s talking about testicles. They turn out to be relatives of
   the potato knish.

   The protein seems to fortify Stuart for farm and packhouse
   conversations that quickly grow weedy with numbers. Kilos, tons,
   containers, pallets, percentages rejected, recovered, left for dead.
   His stomach for such minutiae is large. “I want to be able to tell
   Europeans that their preference for a closed tip on their asparagus
   equals X million acres of land, X million gallons of water, and X
   million pounds of fertilizer wasted.” He takes a breath. “I need to
   make a headline, to tell people in a concise way that their choices
   matter.”

   Indeed they do. With governments fretting over how to feed more than
   nine billion people by 2050, a dominant narrative calls for increasing
   global food production by 70 to 100 percent. But agriculture already
   represents one of the greatest threats to planetary health. It is
   responsible for 70 percent of the planet’s freshwater withdrawals, 80
   percent of the world’s tropical and subtropical deforestation, and 30
   to 35 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. As the
   population grows and emerging economies develop a taste for meat and
   dairy products, which require huge inputs of grain and other resources
   for relatively little caloric gain, this toll will worsen. But
   converting more wildlands to farm fields may not be necessary, some
   experts say. If we slash waste, change our diet to eat less meat and
   dairy, divert fewer food crops to biofuels, and boost yields on
   underperforming acres, we may be able to feed more than nine billion
   people a healthy diet without trashing more rain forests, plowing up
   more prairies, or wiping out more wetlands.

   Selling Surplus

   Staggered to learn that the U.S. wastes 30 to 40 percent of its food
   while one in seven people suffers from food insecurity, Doug Rauch,
   former president of Trader Joe’s, opened a nonprofit supermarket in
   Dorchester, Massachusetts. Called Daily Table, the supermarket sells
   discounted fruits and vegetables that are about to be discarded because
   they’re too close to peak freshness; it also sells inexpensive surplus
   goods and prepares healthy to-go meals. “Hunger and wasted food,” Rauch
   says, “are two problems that can have one solution.”

   Stuart never loses sight of this big picture, but he knows that
   paradigm changes are incremental. And so he stands in the desert behind
   an Ica packinghouse, hammering away at Luis Torres, general manager of
   Shuman Produce Peru. Lacking a local market for what he cannot export,
   Torres annually dumps 3.5 million pounds of small or imperfectly
   spherical onions. But he’s reluctant to blame buyers for this loss.

   “If I complain, the supermarket will find a new farmer,” he says,
   shrugging. “I am a practical person. I can do nothing to change the
   rules.”

   Standing with his feet spread and arms crossed, Stuart replies, “I
   can.”

   Three years ago Stuart spent a week running around the Kenyan
   countryside, hunting down ingredients for a formal dinner in Nairobi
   where the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) would highlight
   the problem of food waste. A hundred miles from the capital, he met a
   farmer forced by European cosmetic standards to reject 40 tons a week
   of green beans, broccoli, sugar snap peas, and runner beans—enough food
   to serve 250,000 people. Within a year Stuart and a camera crew
   returned to Kenya and discovered that farmers were grading out nearly
   half of their harvest in fields and packhouses, with green bean farmers
   losing even more product by trimming both the tips and the tails of
   each surviving bean. Supermarkets also routinely canceled orders at the
   last minute without compensating the farmers. After Feedback publicized
   images of the rejected beans and accused major supermarket chains of
   transferring their costs to relatively powerless growers, U.K. grocers
   were ready to talk. They eventually agreed to bear the cost of order
   cancellations and to expand the length of their packaging, which
   allowed green beans to be trimmed at only one end. Not only would less
   food and fewer resources be wasted, but farmers might also be able to
   plant fewer acres.

   “Tristram identified a problem, and he did something about it,” says
   Clementine O’Connor, a consultant on sustainable food to the UNEP.
   “He’s been a lone voice defending farmers from unfair trading
   practices, identifying barriers, and catalyzing action, often in cases
   where supermarkets and governments were not aware of the problem.”

   Eating Ugly

   Imperfect, a start-up based in Emeryville, California, buys
   outré-looking produce from farmers and delivers it, at low cost, to
   more than a thousand San Francisco Bay Area subscribers. U.S. and
   European retail chains also have had success selling odd-looking fruits
   and vegetables at discount. “We’re redefining beauty, not taste,” says
   Ron Clark, an Imperfect founder.

   Feedback’s 2015 report on Kenyan green beans was just one achievement
   in a watershed year. By the end of 2015 the UN and the U.S. had pledged
   to halve food waste by 2030. The exact mechanisms of this ambitious
   goal haven’t been spelled out. But already countries and companies are
   devising and adopting standardized metrics to quantify waste. If the
   target is met, enough food could be saved to feed at least one billion
   people.

   On an overcast Thursday afternoon in September, Stuart strides through
   a muddy field in northern France. He plunges his hands into a mound of
   soil and extracts several thin-skinned potatoes, which, being the size
   of thimbles and thumbs, had slipped through the mechanical harvester’s
   grasp. For the next hour and a half he and a team of gleaners comb
   through the soil. The goal is to gather 1,100 pounds of spuds for
   Sunday’s Feeding the 5,000 event, to be held in Paris’s locus of civic
   activism, the stately Place de la République. The next day Stuart and
   another team of volunteers from partner organizations wash their
   enormous haul in a ramshackle squat in the 12th arrondissement.
   Standing shirtless in a cluttered room redolent of sweat and pot, with
   music blasting, Stuart scolds a woman for wasting time by scrubbing the
   potatoes twice. Feeling bullied, she blurts a two-word vulgarism.
   Stuart crows, “That’s what everyone says to me!”

   On Saturday it’s time to chop. Gathering at rows of plastic tables in
   the square, hundreds of volunteers come and go over a period of four
   hours, dicing roughly 3,900 pounds of potatoes, eggplants, carrots, and
   red peppers—some gleaned from farms, some donated by the Rungis
   wholesale market. Mostly veterans of mass production, the helpers
   shuttle produce from crates to giant plastic bowls and then to blue
   plastic bags. At 5 a.m. on Sunday the chef, Peter O’Grady, a Hare
   Krishna who runs a charity kitchen in London, tips those bags into
   chest-high metal tanks atop gas burners.

   As midday approaches, the park grows crowded. Musicians perform
   onstage, and two-legged carrots and eggplants parade and chant, “No
   more vegetable waste!” Stuart is absent, his presence superfluous. As
   6,100 diners begin to queue up, the servers don gloves, hats, and
   aprons. At noon Stuart materializes. He mounts the stage and grabs the
   mike. He thanks everyone who made the banquet possible, calls food
   waste a scandal, briefly links agriculture to climate change, then
   withdraws from the stage. But not before shouting, “Bon appétit.”

   Feeding a Need

   Kevin Boyd eats an after-school dinner provided by DC Central Kitchen,
   a nonprofit that trains chefs and provides 11,000 meals a day in
   shelters, schools, and other locations. Almost half these meals come
   from food that would otherwise have gone to waste. At the center the
   students do their homework and learn how to make healthy meals, such as
   smoothies and homemade granola. “I always tell him, Don’t say you don’t
   like it until you try it,” says Kevin's mother, Antoinette Boyd.

One million species at risk of extinction, UN report warns

A landmark global assessment warns that the window is closing to safeguard
biodiversity and a healthy planet. Yet solutions are in sight.

   5 Minute Read
     __________________________________________________________________

   By Stephen Leahy

   PUBLISHED May 6, 2019

   The bonds that hold nature together may be at risk of unraveling from
   deforestation, overfishing, development, and other human activities, a
   landmark United Nations report warns. Thanks to human pressures, one
   million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years, with
   serious consequences for human beings as well as the rest of life on
   Earth.

   “The evidence is crystal clear: Nature is in trouble. Therefore we are
   in trouble,” said Sandra Díaz, one of the co-chairs of the Global
   Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. A 40-page
   “Summary for Policy Makers” of the forthcoming full report (expected to
   exceed 1,500 pages) was released May 6 in Paris.

   Based on a review of about 15,000 scientific and government sources and
   compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries, the global report is
   the first comprehensive look in 15 years at the state of the planet’s
   biodiversity. This report includes, for the first time, indigenous and
   local knowledge as well as scientific studies. The authors say they
   found overwhelming evidence that human activities are behind nature’s
   decline. They ranked the major drivers of species decline as land
   conversion, including deforestation; overfishing; bush meat hunting and
   poaching; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species.

   The tremendous variety of living species—at least 8.7 million, but
   possibly many more—that make up our “life-supporting safety net”
   provide our food, clean water, air, energy, and more, said Díaz, an
   ecologist at the National University of Cordoba in Argentina, in an
   interview. “Not only is our safety net shrinking, it’s becoming more
   threadbare and holes are appearing.”

A world of green slime?

   In parts of the ocean, little life remains but green slime. Some remote
   tropical forests are nearly silent as insects have vanished, and
   grasslands are increasingly becoming deserts. Human activity has
   resulted in the severe alteration of more than 75 percent of Earth’s
   land areas, the Global Assessment found. And 66 percent of the oceans,
   which cover most of our blue planet, have suffered significant human
   impacts. This includes more than 400 dead zones—where scant life can
   survive—that collectively would cover the state of Oregon or Wyoming.

   The new report paints “an ominous picture” of the health of ecosystems
   rapidly deteriorating, said Sir Robert Watson, Chair of the
   Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services (IPBES), which conducted the global assessment. IPBES is often
   described as the equivalent of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate
   Change for biodiversity and does scientific assessments on the status
   of the non-human life that makes up the Earth’s life-support system.

   “We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods,
   food security, health, and quality of life worldwide,” Watson said in a
   statement.

   “My biggest personal concern is the state of the oceans,” Watson told
   National Geographic. “Plastics, dead zones, overfishing,
   acidification... We’re really screwing up the oceans in a big way.”

Saving more species

   Protecting nature and saving species is all about securing the land and
   water plants and animals need to survive, said Jonathan Baillie,
   executive vice president and chief scientist of the National Geographic
   Society. Protecting half of the planet by 2050, with an interim target
   of 30 percent by 2030, is the only way to meet the Paris climate
   targets or achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for the
   world, Baillie said.

   Forests, oceans, and other parts of nature soak up 60 percent of global
   fossil fuel emissions every year, the report found. “We need to secure
   the biosphere to protect the climate and help buffer us from extreme
   weather events,” Baillie said.

   Coral reefs and mangroves protect coastal areas from storms such as
   hurricanes. Wetlands reduce flooding by absorbing heavy rainfall. Yet
   each of these ecosystems has declined dramatically, with wetlands down
   to less than 15 percent of what they were 300 years ago and coral reefs
   facing a global bleaching crisis.

   Nearly 100 groups around the world (including the National Geographic
   Society and the Wyss Campaign for Nature) have endorsed the goal of
   protecting half of the planet by 2050. Recently, 19 of the world’s
   leading scientists published a study to make a science-backed plan for
   an interim step that would protect 30 percent by 2030 under what’s
   called a Global Deal for Nature. The proposed protection does not mean
   “no go” areas, but rather areas protected from resource extraction and
   land conversion. Sustainable uses would be permitted in all but the
   most sensitive areas, the groups wrote.

   “The international community has both the time and the tools to
   safeguard nature and slow the ongoing wildlife extinction crisis,”
   Brian O’Donnell, director of the Wyss Campaign for Nature, said in a
   statement.

   National Geographic Society and the Wyss Campaign for Nature are
   working together to inspire the protection of 30 percent of the planet
   by 2030.

   Such tools were under discussion during the week-long negotiations by
   IPBES country members who debated the key messages and policy options
   to be published in the “Summary for Policymakers.” The full Global
   Assessment report will be published later this year.

   “The main message of our report is that transformative change is
   urgently needed. There are no other options” said David Obura, a marine
   biologist at the Coastal Oceans Research and Development – Indian Ocean
   in Mombasa, Kenya. “There’s so little time left to save corals. If we
   can save corals we could save everything.”

Value nature not stuff

   In order to safeguard a healthy planet, society needs to shift from a
   sole focus on chasing economic growth, the summary report concludes.
   That won’t be easy, the report acknowledges. But it could get easier if
   countries begin to base their economies on an understanding that nature
   is the foundation for development. Shifting to nature-based planning
   can help provide a better quality of life with far less impact.

   Putting that concept into practical terms, the report says countries
   need to reform hundreds of billions in dollars in subsidies and
   incentives that are currently given to the energy, fishing,
   agricultural, and forestry sectors. Instead of driving additional
   exploitation of the world’s natural resources, those monies should be
   shifted to incentivize protection and restoration of nature—such as
   underwriting new reserves or reforestation programs, the report said.

   “We need to change what we value: nature, ecosystems, social equity,
   not growing the GDP,” Obura said.
   Three New Marine Parks Protect Stunning Biodiversity

   The other evidence gathered by IPBES shows that nature managed by
   indigenous peoples and local communities is in generally better health
   than nature managed by national or corporate institutions, despite
   increasing pressures, said Joji Cariño, a senior policy advisor at the
   Forest Peoples Programme, a human rights organization.

   At least a quarter of the global land area is traditionally owned,
   managed, used, or occupied by indigenous peoples. However, their land
   tenure and other rights are not always protected or recognized by all
   countries. Nor is their deep knowledge of the land and their values
   often considered in policies and decisions by governments. That needs
   to change, the Global Assessment noted.

   “Indigenous peoples are key partners in the global transformation
   that’s needed,” said Cariño.

   Yet countries still are slow to recognize this, she adds. As an
   example, she points to the Philippines. Forty years ago, indigenous
   people there stopped construction of dams on the Chico River because
   they were concerned about impacts on their land. Yet those dams are now
   being built by China under their trillion-dollar Belt and Road
   infrastructure initiative.

   China has an important role to play in global discussions around
   biodiversity, because the country will host a major United Nations
   conference called the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in late
   2020. Scientists hope a new, ambitious international agreement to
   protect the planet could happen there, akin to the Paris agreement
   around climate.

   Assessment co-chair Díaz doesn’t yet know if a global agreement will
   arise as bold as protecting 30 percent by 2030. “If it were easy it
   would have already happened,” Diaz said.

   “However, the evidence is clear: the future will be bad for us if we
   don’t act now. There is no future for us without nature.”

   Fueling Agriculture to Fuel Humans

   Of the less than 1 percent of freshwater available for human use, a
   whopping 70 percent goes toward growing food and raising animals.

   Your diet is probably the biggest slice of your water footprint,
   especially if you eat meat from cows and other animals fed with
   water-intensive crops, such as corn. Cutting consumption of animal
   products in half would reduce the U.S.’s dietary requirements of water
   by 37 percent. The average U.S. diet currently takes 1,320 gallons
   (4,997 liters) of water a day to produce.

   Food is also a means by which water is moved, or imported and exported,
   around the world. You may find that the rice you bought today was grown
   in a dry region of Jordan with the help of highly engineered, but not
   always very efficient, irrigation systems. For example, northern China
   annually exports to south China about 1.8 trillion cubic feet (52
   billion cubic meters) of water indirectly through foodstuffs and other
   products.

   In areas where food is not taken for granted—often the same areas where
   droughts and flooding hit the hardest—there are 850 million people
   annually suffering from malnutrition. As water becomes less accessible,
   so does food.

Fast Facts

     * More efficient irrigation practices, such as drip and
       micro-sprinklers, can reduce the volume of water applied to
       agricultural fields by 30-70 percent and can increase crop yields
       by 20-90 percent.

     * Drip irrigation is used on less than 2 percent of irrigated land
       worldwide.

     * Reducing U.S. irrigation demands by even 10 percent could free up
       enough freshwater to meet the new urban and industrial water
       demands anticipated for 2025.
