About

   —

   At the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists we want to
   inspire and cultivate a global community of reporters and readers who
   believe journalism can bring about positive change.

   —

   ICIJ is a unique organization. A U.S.-based nonprofit, we are both a
   small, resourceful newsroom with our own reporting team, as well as a
   global network of reporters and media organizations who work together
   to investigate the most important stories in the world.

   Our network of trusted members encompasses 249 of the best
   investigative reporters from more than 90 countries and territories. We
   also partner with more than 100 media organizations, from the world’s
   most renowned outlets, including the BBC, the New York Times, the
   Guardian and the Asahi Shimbun, to small regional nonprofit
   investigative centers.

   Drawing on the expertise and reach of our network, we collaborate on
   groundbreaking investigations that expose the truth and hold the
   powerful accountable, while also adhering to the highest standards of
   fairness and accuracy.

   The ICIJ core team is small, but ambitious. We want to empower our
   readers to engage with their local communities about issues of global
   importance, such as broken systems and abuses of power. And we want to
   do that by harnessing the enormous strength of our extensive network.

   In addition to our U.S. staff, we have team members in Australia,
   France, Costa Rica, Spain, Hungary, Germany and England.

   We are passionate about the power of journalism and provide the tools
   and guidance needed to successfully pull off unprecedented reporting
   collaborations.

   Over the years, ICIJ has released dozens of investigations – including
   the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers – and we have won many awards
   for our work.

   ICIJ is fully funded by donations. You can read more about our
   supporters here, and explore the impact of our work here.

   ICIJ encourages tips, leaks and story ideas from the public,
   whistleblowers, as well as from outstanding investigative journalists
   interested in collaborating with us. Please don’t hesitate to contact
   us with your ideas.

   If you are a journalist and want to be considered for ICIJ membership
   please send us your CV and clips.
