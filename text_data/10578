Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's New Nanny Is a 'Blessing,' Source Says

   Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are happy with their current nanny for
   their son, 3-month-old Archie, a royal source tells ET.

   ET learned in July that the couple hired a new nanny for Archie after
   the first two didn't work out. According to our source, the recent hire
   is a woman and she's been "a blessing" so far. The new nanny was seen
   accompanying Meghan and Harry on their recent getaway to their good
   friend, Elton John's, chateau in France, and is expected to accompany
   the couple on their upcoming royal tour of South Africa in the fall.

   As for why 38-year-old Meghan and 34-year-old Harry are on their third
   nanny, the source says that the first nanny was let go for a "lapse in
   professional duties" and parted ways with the couple very quickly.
   Meanwhile, the second nanny was actually a night nurse and was not
   living in the home, the source explains.

   But a new nanny isn't the only new face on Meghan and Harry's team. The
   source says that the couple has been beefing up their staff with
   multiple new appointments as they get ready for a busy fall and
   Meghan’s return from maternity leave, including a new private secretary
   replacing trusted aide Samantha Cohen.

   Ahead of Archie's birth, ET learned that Meghan and Harry had recruited
   a reputable London agency to assist them in finding them a nanny to
   help raise their child. The source noted at the time that the couple
   wasn't opposed to an American nanny and simply wanted "what's best for
   their child."

   In June, royal expert Katie Nicholl told ET that the then-nanny to the
   Duke and Duchess of Sussex "had to sign quite an extensive
   nondisclosure agreement." She also said that despite the help from a
   nanny, it doesn't mean that Meghan isn't facing the same sleepless
   nights any new mother faces.

   "Meghan's been up in the night nursing, feeding on demand every few
   hours," Nicholl said. "Apparently he's a hungry little baby."

Serena Williams Opens Up About Helping Plan Meghan Markle's Baby Shower: 'I'm
a Perfectionist'

   By Scott Baumgartner‍ ‍ 5:18 PM PDT, April 23, 2019

   When Serena Williams hosts a baby shower, it is THE baby shower!

   The 23-time tennis champ recently sat down for an interview
   with Business of Fashion where she opened up about putting together her
   friend Meghan Markle's shower to celebrate the arrival of her first
   child with Prince Harry, who should be arriving "any day" now.

   "Planning something like that takes a lot of effort. I'm a
   perfectionist, so I'm like, 'Let's make it perfect,'" she relayed to
   the publication. "It's been a lot the last few days."

   But that wasn't the only thing she was dealing with that week in
   February. It just so happens that she was also slated to introduce Best
   Picture nominee A Star Is Born at the 2019 Academy Awards.

   Serena Williams, then read the full interview with the world-class
   tennis player, in which she talks about her love of fashion, her
   previous challenges in the space and how on-court successes and
   setbacks have helped prepare her for entrepreneurship. [Link in bio]

   A post shared by The Business of Fashion (@bof) on Apr 23, 2019 at
   3:13am PDT

   Nonetheless, according to our royal insider, the 37-year-old pro
   athlete's party went off without a hitch! The gathering at The Mark
   Hotel in New York was attended by close friends of Meghan's like Amal
   Clooney, Gayle King and Abigail Spencer. She also had some help from
   Meghan's pal Genevieve Hillis and the duchess' wedding planner Jennifer
   Zabinski, who reportedly coordinated the event.

   Gifts were placed in a decorated crib as they entered the bash and
   guests enjoyed cuisine by Michelin star Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
   A flower-arranging session was set up alongside snacks including cotton
   candy machines, which had blue and pink colors available.

   The source added that Williams paid close attention to details and made
   sure it was a special day for the mother-to-be. There was also
   reportedly a harpist playing at the gathering.

   "A good time was had by all. That's what I'll say," King coyly shared
   on CBS News afterward.

   "If I told you, you know, I'd have to kill you," she playfully added.
   "She didn't open any of the gifts because she wants to do that when she
   and Harry are back together. So I really don't know what everybody got.
   I think I got something I think is very nice."

   As the world anxiously awaits for the latest addition to the royal
   family, new rumors are surfacing that Meghan and Harry are considering
   foregoing their new home nearby Windsor Castle in favor of Africa.

   Buckingham Palace has released a statement addressing the rumors,
   noting that "any future plans" for Meghan and Harry are "speculative at
   this stage," and "no decision has been taken about future roles."  They
   do not, however, completely deny the report.

Samuel L. Jackson Teases Nick Fury's Backstory and Captain Marvel's Ability
to Time Travel (Set Visit)

   By John Boone‍ 9:05 AM PST, January 8, 2019
   Courtesy of Marvel Studios

   A mannequin head sits outside a trailer on the Sony lot, propped up on
   a stick and with a curly, black wig atop it, a crewmember carefully
   blotting the wig with a towel in the warm afternoon heat. This is Nick
   Fury's wig, and it's how the iconically bald Samuel L. Jackson is
   transforming into his Marvel alter-ego some 20 years in the past in
   Captain Marvel.

   That, plus a series of dots mapped across the actor's face, is used to
   pull off an uncanny de-aging and bring Fury to life decades before he
   would begin recruiting Avengers in 2008's Iron Man. A group of
   reporters has gathered with a bewigged, eyepatch-less Jackson on the
   set to discuss what this iteration of Nick Fury is like.

   "You trying to get me fired?" he deadpans incredulously. This being
   Jackson's ninth appearance in Marvel's cinematic universe, he knows
   better than anyone what lengths the studio goes to in order to protect
   its secrets. (And it's ironic, then, that soon after he's the one who
   drops a potentially massive clue for Avengers: Endgame.) "What am I
   allowed to say?" he asks a nearby publicist, who reassures Jackson that
   he is allowed to share Fury's basic backstory.

   "Really?! S**t," he says, though he thoughtfully parses out his words,
   nonetheless. "I've been riding a desk at..." S.H.I.E.L.D.? "So, you
   don't need me," Jackson chuckles. "I've been riding a desk at
   S.H.I.E.L.D. and trying to figure out where the next threat will be
   coming from, dealing with NSA and all these other people, never
   thinking that there were extra terrestrials. This is the first time
   that I encountered them and form a belief that those people are out
   there, and that there are people who have extraordinary abilities that
   can help us combat them."

   Personality-wise, how is Fury in the '90s different than the Fury we
   know from Iron Man on?

   Probably not as cynical just yet. Things are changing. The world is
   changing for him, how he views it in terms of who we are in respect to
   the rest of the galaxy and there [being] a much greater thing out there
   than who we are and what we are -- and that they pose a greater threat
   than anyone even knows and we literally have no defenses against them.

   [Producer] Jonathan Schwartz said that this movie is a two-hander that
   features Nick Fury prominently. What do we learn about Fury that we
   haven't over the course of this last decade of him popping in and out
   of movies?

   You'll see, specifically, the origin of what happened to his eye.
   You'll find out that he does have a family, that's referenced. You
   don't see them, but they are referenced in another way. There are
   things we talk about in his backstory that haven't been talked about
   before -- where he's from, what he's done. There are times when he
   actually, humanly reacts to things with fear and awe, instead of the
   stone face that he normally has, before he learns to control his
   emotions in another way.

   We don't talk about none of his war experiences. We talk about him
   being in the war, leaving the war, being a spy and some of the things
   he did when he was a spy that got him to this particular place. So, we
   get more of a backstory, and we get more of what turns him into this
   person that you originally meet in Iron Man.

   Did you know all of that, about his backstory, before you started
   filming? Or was this movie a discovery for you, too, in terms of this
   character?

   There are specific things that are documented about his backstory, back
   when he was a white guy fighting in the war. [Laughs] I've been reading
   Nick Fury since I was a kid, so there are a lot of things that I know
   about him and about his origin story and the people that he fought with
   and who he knew before all that happened. And then by the time we got
   to the Ultimates Nick Fury, all of a sudden [he] turns into me, out of
   nowhere, because of [comic book writer] Mark Millar, and we start a
   whole new kind of backstory timeline.

   What was one specific fact that you learned about him on this film?

   That everybody calls him Fury, even his mother.

   Can you tell us more about the scene you're filming? They told us
   you're on a Kree ship.

   Well, that's what they wanted you to know! You're trying to get me
   fired again.

   He's dealing with the Flerken for the first time, and it looks like
   this is his first time seeing the Tesseract.

   He who? He me? I've heard the cat referred to as a Flerken. I didn't
   know what that meant, so I vaguely have an idea now what that means.
   And we're actually entering a ship that belonged to a doctor from Carol
   Danvers' past. She's trying to find some answers to what happened, why
   he was on Earth and what that whole power core thing-- Seems like the
   Tesseract has been the constant in all these movies.
   [captain-marvel-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson.jpg]

   What is Fury and Carol's dynamic like when they first cross paths with
   each other?

   Well, when they first cross paths, she's just a crazy lady that broke
   into Blockbuster. She's standing there telling me that she came from
   some planet and she's got on strange clothes and she's saying there are
   these shape-shifting people that have infiltrated Earth. And we're kind
   of looking at her like a normal person would look at a person who tells
   you something like that. You kind of go, Yeah, right. Then she runs
   away and later on, I discover, OK! She might have been telling the
   truth. So, that changes that dynamic for the next time we see each
   other.

   Clark Gregg is also back as Phil Coulson. Is your relationship dynamic
   new here?

   He's brand new. He's just joined S.H.I.E.L.D., so he's a rookie and I
   have to ask his name at a certain point. Who are you again? Yeah, he's
   brand new.

   What has it been like working with Brie?

   It's my third time with Brie. I did Kong with her and then she directed
   me in her own movie, Unicorn Store, and now we're here. We're very good
   friends. We work well together. We laugh together. We sing together. We
   developed a really, really great relationship when we were on Kong,
   traveling all over the world doing that thing and she was running back
   and forth to all her award shows being lauded. You know, it's fun to be
   in the saddle with her, and I think it's comforting for her to have
   someone around like me, that's actually been a part of this Marvel
   universe for a while, who understands the largeness and the
   expectations that are there, so that she doesn't feel pressure.

   I understand that there are some things that go with that -- you being
   a new character that's being introduced, wanting to be as dynamic as
   all those other characters you've seen. It's kind of crazy to go to
   something like Avengers and Black Panther before you start shooting,
   and you look at it and you go, Oh my god, what do I have to do? Part of
   my job being with her is to tell her, "Look, create this character that
   you want and make her as dynamic as you want her to be. And Marvel
   takes care of the rest." They're responsible for marketing and making
   it all those other things. But we got a good script, she's a good
   actress, I'm OK. [Laughs] You know, we got things going on. It's like
   we always said about Kong. We're there, yeah, but it's so much about
   those other things.

   This is Marvel’s first female-led superhero film. Why do you think
   Captain Marvel is the right character to headline her own movie?

   She’s pretty much the strongest character -- in terms of someone with
   powers are able to do things -- in the Marvel universe. So, for Carol
   Danvers to be that person and for Brie to become that person, it's
   gonna be a dynamite thing. I mean, [the Avengers] are up against some
   really, really tough odds right now -- we saw throughout Infinity War
   -- so now we know that we need something that's as powerful as Thanos.
   And at some point, we'll find out how powerful she is and all the
   things that she's capable of. She's one of the few people in the Marvel
   universe that can time travel, so...

   Having known Brie for a while now, what is it about her that you think
   makes her the perfect Captain Marvel?

   She has a lot of compassion, for one. She’s a very principled
   individual, as you can see from her IG. She champions all of the right
   causes. She's very aware of who she is and her place in the universe,
   in terms of what she is as a person of influence [being] an actress and
   her voice being used in the right way. She has the strength and
   determination that, for a person her age-- There are all the kinds of
   things she could have done aside from putting herself through six
   months of torture to get ready to do this role.

   If you see her workouts -- she sends me videos of her workouts -- she's
   working very hard. Her body is incredible now from all the stuff she's
   done. She's down to, like, five percent body fat, maybe. She's all
   muscle. She couldn't do push-ups when they started. She can do lots of
   push-ups now. She pushes Jeeps uphill as part of her training. She's
   totally dedicated to making this something, and the way she empowers
   women already, you know that she is going to give this character the
   qualities that will make any woman, young girl, anybody looking at this
   wish they could be her or feel like they could, because they have the
   ability.

   Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's New Nanny Is a 'Blessing,' Source Says
   Antoinette Bueno‍
   9:40 AM PDT, August 28, 2019

   Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are happy with their current nanny for
   their son, 3-month-old Archie, a royal source tells ET.

   ET learned in July that the couple hired a new nanny for Archie after
   the first two didn't work out. According to our source, the recent hire
   is a woman and she's been "a blessing" so far. The new nanny was seen
   accompanying Meghan and Harry on their recent getaway to their good
   friend, Elton John's, chateau in France, and is expected to accompany
   the couple on their upcoming royal tour of South Africa in the fall.

   As for why 38-year-old Meghan and 34-year-old Harry are on their third
   nanny, the source says that the first nanny was let go for a "lapse in
   professional duties" and parted ways with the couple very quickly.
   Meanwhile, the second nanny was actually a night nurse and was not
   living in the home, the source explains.

   But a new nanny isn't the only new face on Meghan and Harry's team. The
   source says that the couple has been beefing up their staff with
   multiple new appointments as they get ready for a busy fall and
   Meghan’s return from maternity leave, including a new private secretary
   replacing trusted aide Samantha Cohen.

   Ahead of Archie's birth, ET learned that Meghan and Harry had recruited
   a reputable London agency to assist them in finding them a nanny to
   help raise their child. The source noted at the time that the couple
   wasn't opposed to an American nanny and simply wanted "what's best for
   their child."

   In June, royal expert Katie Nicholl told ET that the then-nanny to the
   Duke and Duchess of Sussex "had to sign quite an extensive
   nondisclosure agreement." She also said that despite the help from a
   nanny, it doesn't mean that Meghan isn't facing the same sleepless
   nights any new mother faces.

   "Meghan's been up in the night nursing, feeding on demand every few
   hours," Nicholl said. "Apparently he's a hungry little baby."
