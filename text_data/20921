Egg Tacos with Roasted Poblano and Corn Salsa + Excellent Mail-Order Flour
Tortillas

   September 18, 2019
   A plate of an egg taco topped with roasted vegetable salsa.

   Good tortillas are hard to find. Flour tortillas can be gummy; corn
   tortillas often taste like sawdust. The corn-flour hybrids, I think,
   are the best. A few years ago, I discovered one from Whole Foods, which
   I loved: it had a soft texture and nice corn flavor. But the formula,
   as far as I can ...

French Apple Tart, Revisited

   September 13, 2019
   Just baked French apple tart on sheet pan.

   A few weeks ago I came across a photo of an apple tart in Sarah
   Copeland's Every Day is Saturday that stopped me in my tracks. For one,
   it was stunning. But two, the apples had their skins on! I am always
   peeling apples for pies, tarts, galettes, and the like, but maybe, I
   wondered, I didn't have ...

Israeli-Spiced Tomato and Chickpea Salad with Yogurt Sauce

   September 10, 2019
   A platter of Israeli spiced tomato salad with cucumber yogurt sauce and
   chickpeas.

   I grew up eating meat with tzatziki, a garlicky, lemony-yogurt sauce.
   Most often it was aside this chicken souvlaki, a favorite summer meal,
   but in addition to mint sauce, it often was on the table with lamb,
   too. In recent years, I've learned I love yogurt sauce just as much
   with vegetables — I ...

Chatting Tomatoes, Corn, Zucchini & More with Margaret Roach

   August 31, 2019
   A bowl of Julia Moskin's Best Spanish Gazpacho.

   Funny story: My aunt Marcy (the one with the dogs in Vermont) came to
   visit me on Tuesday. She arrived with a bag of special Vermont plums
   (delicious!), a tub of pineapple tomatillos (irresistible!), and a
   glass pitcher filled with an orange-y hued purée I recognized instantly
   as Julia Moskin's ...

Spicy, Blistered Green Beans with Sizzling Garlic and Capers

   August 9, 2019
   A plate of spicy, blistered green beans with garlic.

   I've had this Bon Appetit recipe bookmarked since April, when I first
   read about it Carla Lalli Music's Wednesday newsletter.* The recipe is
   a spin on the Sichuan "dry-fried" preparation for string beans.
   Dry-frying, if you are unfamiliar, is a complete misnomer — classic
   recipes call for ...

Cookbook

   Sometimes all you want is a no-frills stuffing: bread tossed with
   seasoning, mixed with copious amounts of butter, onions, and celery.
   But sometimes you want a stuffing studded with dried cranberries and
   chestnuts, laced with sweet onions (also sautéed in copious amounts of
   butter), strewn with kale that crisps up like chips as irresistible as
   the crusty cubes it surrounds. You can have both In this Bread Toast
   Crumbs Cookbook. // alexandracooks.com

   Instagram post 2145336477055579723_3120146 Spicy, smoky vegetarian
   chili to curl up to all fall⁣ 🌶🍃🍁🍃🌶🍃🍁⁣After four of my Greek cousins
   confessed (at Greek Easter while staring at the lamb turning around the
   spit) that they had become (nearly) vegetarians and were no longer
   adding meat to my favorite chili recipe, I had to take action. ⁣This is
   the result: a mix of beans and bulgur, a heap of vegetables, spices,
   and a number of umami-rich pantry staples. I find it deeply comforting,
   and I hope you will, too.⁣⁣Recipe linked in profile, how-to in stories⁣

   Instagram post 2140955653640169913_3120146 For years, my biggest tip
   for making exceptional chocolate chip cookies every time was to ...⁣
   🍪🍪🍪⁣... refrigerate the portioned (weighed!) dough balls for at least a
   day (preferably longer) before baking.⁣⁣But I recently learned 2 more
   tips from @jeffreylarsen_foodstylist ’s Gluten Free Baking at Home that
   are blowing my mind 🤯🤯:⁣1. Use clarified butter. Butter has a ton of
   water, and when you clarify it, you remove the water (and milk solids),
   leaving the butter fat behind. Without all that water in the mix, the
   cookies won’t spread as much. 👍🏽👍🏽⁣2. Freeze the dough and bake
   straight from the freezer, no need to adjust the time. Frozen cookies
   bake more gradually, so there’s less spread and a higher
   rise👍🏽👍🏽⁣Friends, @jeffreylarsen_foodstylist #glutenfreebakingathome
   made its way into the world yesterday, and it is a beauty, filled with
   nuggets for bakers of all kind, gluten-free or otherwise.⁣⁣His
   #glutenfree chocolate chip cookies are exceptional, and the recipe is
