8. Your rights

     * 8.1 In this section , we have summarised the rights that you have
       under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not
       all of the details have been included in our summaries.
       Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from
       the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
     * 8.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:

     * (a) the right to access;
     * (b) the right to rectification;
     * (c) the right to erasure;
     * (d) the right to restrict processing;
     * (e) the right to object to processing;
     * (f) the right to data portability;
     * (g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
     * (h) the right to withdraw consent.

     8.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we
   process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal
   data, together with certain additional information. That additional
   information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the
   categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the
   personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not
   affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first
   copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be
   subject to a reasonable fee. You can access your personal data by
   visiting Account Settings when logged into our website.

     8.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you
   rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to
   have any incomplete personal data about you completed.

     8.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your
   personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the
   personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for
   which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent
   to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain
   rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct
   marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully
   processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The
   general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for
   exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for
   compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise
   or defence of legal claims.

     8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the
   processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest
   the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you
   oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of
   our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment,
   exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to
   processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where
   processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store
   your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with
   your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
   claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
   person; or for reasons of important public interest.

     8.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
   data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the
   extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing
   is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public
   interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or
   the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
   party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the
   personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
   grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and
   freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or
   defence of legal claims.

     8.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
   data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct
   marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to
   process your personal data for this purpose.

     8.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal
   data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
   purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the
   processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for
   reasons of public interest.

     8.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
   personal data is:
     * (a) consent; or
     * (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a
       contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your
       request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is
       carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your
       personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
       machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where
       it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

     8.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information
   infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a
   complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.
   You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your
   place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.

     8.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
   personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that
   consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
   processing before the withdrawal.

     8.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal
   data by contacting us using the details outlined in Section 14.
