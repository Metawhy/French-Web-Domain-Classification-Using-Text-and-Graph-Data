     * Cloud scraping
       runs entirely in the cloud. No need to download software, maintain
       servers or install updates.
     * High availability
       With Extracty you don't need to worry about scaling, infrastructure
       or security. Just deploy your endpoints and relax.
     * Rapid Development
       Your scrapers are already 99% done. All that's missing is a bit of
       JavaScript to select the elements you need.

Scrape anything on demand.

   Extracty extracts the data when you need it. After creating an endpoint
   you can call the url and always get the latest data back.
     * Specify extraction selectors and action flows.
       Simply click the elements you want to extract and Extracty will
       generate a matching selector for you. Specify actions to be
       executed on the result.
     * Update the code and add business logic.
       Extracty lets you update the code it generated to give you full
       control. This lets you add custom logic and change the output to
       the format you want.
     * Create your API and start rocking!
       Currently Extracty supports accessing the latest data through a
       clean JSON API. You can even see analytics how often your endpoint
       was called!
