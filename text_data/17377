   The Responsible Flannel gives you everything you want in your favorite
   shirt, without compromising the earth. That means a fabrication made up
   of organic and recycled materials. Buttons made with corozo nuts. All
   constructed in a factory that’s GOTS certified, which means it meets
   the strictest of social and environmental criteria. And to top it all
   off, it just may be the most comfortable flannel ever made.

   After combining recycled polyester from REPREVE™ (a North
   Carolina-based factory that transforms recycled plastic water bottles
   into yarn) and organic cotton sourced by our manufacturer in China, The
   Responsible Flannel is dyed organically. This means the process avoids
   chemicals that are bad for the environment, bad for the workers, and
   bad for your health. Our manufacturer is OCS certified, GOTS certified,
   and a member of the Fair Wear Foundation; these third-party
   verifications make sure the factory’s environmental and social
   conditions meet the highest standards.
