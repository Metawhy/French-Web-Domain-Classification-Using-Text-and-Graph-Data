   Schefter: Gordon is close to ending holdout (1:02)

   Adam Schefter discusses the timeline of when Melvin Gordon might end

   Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon could soon be moving up
   his reporting date, though no final decisions have been made, league
   sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

   Gordon had previously planned to return at some point in October, but
   circumstances have changed and Gordon senses the best way to show his
   value is on the field, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson.

   He must report no later than Nov. 29 to play in 2019 and accrue credit
   for this season toward becoming a free agent in the offseason.

   Without Gordon, the Chargers (1-2) rank 13th in the NFL with 111.7
   rushing yards per game. Austin Ekeler (160 yards this season) and
   Justin Jackson (142) have combined to fill the void.

   Gordon, 26, continues to hold out because of a contract impasse with
   the Chargers. Gordon's representation was granted permission by the
   Chargers to pursue a trade, but so far no deal has materialized.

   Gordon is scheduled to make $5.605 million in the final season of his
   rookie deal. Just before the season, Chargers general manager Tom
   Telesco announced that the team had postponed negotiations with Gordon
   until after the season. If Gordon chooses to report, he will play under
   his current contract.

   Gordon wants a contract extension that will compensate him similarly to
   top backs Todd Gurley, David Johnson and Le'Veon Bell, who earn an
   average of $13 million to $14 million annually. During training camp,
   the Chargers offered Gordon a new contract that would double his salary
   at roughly $10 million annually.

   The former first-round draft pick has rushed for 3,628 yards and has
   1,577 receiving yards with 38 total touchdowns in his first four
   seasons.

   ESPN's Eric D. Williams contributed to this report.

   ATLANTA -- It happened again. And this time it was in a postseason
   game.

   Atlanta Braves center fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. failed to run out a ball
   he hit off the wall in right field, settling for just a single. The
   last time it happened, in August, he was benched. This time, he was
   called out by his teammates after the Braves lost 7-6 to the St. Louis
   Cardinals in Game 1 of their best-of-five National League Division
   Series on Thursday.

   "Yeah, it's frustrating," Braves star first baseman Freddie Freeman
   said. "But I think you have that conversation once. It's kind of
   beating a dead horse after that if you keep having the same
   conversation over and over again. You have to know that was a mistake."

   Acuna connected off Cardinals reliever John Brebbia in the seventh, and
   right-fielder Dexter Fowler played it off the wall. By the time he
   turned to throw the ball back in, Acuna was just getting to first base.
   He didn't have much of an explanation for not running.

   "Things happen. Stuff like this doesn't happen to the one who is
   sitting on the bench," Acuna told ESPN's Enrique Rojas. "It could have
   been a double, but things happen. I didn't speak with the manager about
   it. I just went out to enjoy the game. I always try to give my best,
   but these are things that sometimes get away from me. They are not
   things I want to do. As players, we always try to give our best effort,
   but we make mistakes, we are human."

    'Best ever'? It sounds absurd, but Ronald Acuna Jr. isn't far off

   The inning could have turned out differently if Acuna was at second
   base. An Ozzie Albies groundout would have gotten him to third instead
   of second. He was eventually doubled off the bag when Josh Donaldson
   lined out to shortstop. In a one-run loss, the mistake loomed large.

   "He probably scores in that inning if he's on second base," Albies
   said. "It's a big deal. He knows he needs to do better there."

   The lack of hustle overshadowed Acuna's fantastic night at the plate,
   which included a walk and three hits, including a ninth-inning home
   run. But even the home run irked some; Cardinals reliever Carlos
   Martinez, who surrendered it, was upset at Acuna's home run trot.

   "I simply want him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran
   player," Martinez told reporters. "That's it. Just play the game."

   But in the Braves clubhouse, the focus was on the seventh-inning play.

   "He should have been on second," manager Brian Snitker said. "And we're
   kind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there. You hate to
   see that happen."

   Snitker pulled Acuna from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on
   Aug. 18, trying to make the point to the young star that running out
   every ball is important, even more so in October.

   "That can't happen in the playoffs," Freeman said. "Can't happen in the
   regular season. Unfortunately that happened tonight."

   Teammates didn't say anything publicly that they didn't say to Acuna
   first.

   "A couple guys told him, 'Yeah, just run out of the box,'" Albies
   relayed. "It's something you should do."

   Acuna was asked if he had another chance, would he do things
   differently.

   "Absolutely," he said. "I mean, I was trying to give my best effort and
   those are those things that just kind of get away from you. So,
   obviously, I would've loved to have a double, if I could take it back."

Two die in avalanche in the Tetons

   Two well-known backcountry skiers were killed on Wednesday in Wyoming's
   Grand Teton National Park. Park rangers found the bodies of Jackson
   Hole Mountain Resort employee Chris Onufer and ski mountaineer and
   blogger Steve Romeo on Thursday.

   Grand Teton National Park rangers and Teton County Search and Rescue
   initiated the search after being notified that two skiers failed to
   return home on Wednesday. They found the car of the missing skiers late
   Wednesday night in a trailhead parking lot 10 miles north of Moran
   Junction. They began an aerial reconnaissance flight to Ranger Peak at
   sunrise on Thursday.

   They located a large avalanche debris field on the slope of 11,355-foot
   Ranger Peak just before 9 a.m. and searchers aboard the helicopter
   received signals from two avalanche beacons. A physical search of the
   debris turned up the two missing skiers.

   According to a release from Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, Onufer began
   working at the ski area in 1993 and most recently worked as the manager
   of the tram maintenance department and was an integral figure in the
   development and installation of the new tram, which opened in December
   2008. "A class act and a quiet leader, Chris was humble and let his
   work and achievements speak for themselves, he will be missed by all at
   the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort and in the greater Jackson Hole and
   Teton Valley Communities," states the release.

   Steve Romeo was an avid ski mountaineer and randonee racer who ran a
   popular backcountry skiing blog, TetonAT.com. "There were two things
   that made Steve Romeo tick -- skiing and the Tetons," Romeo's friend
   and ski partner Zahan Billimoria told ESPN. "He was the consummate
   skier whose whole life revolved around making turns. It was really the
   wildness that I think he loved in the whole thing, the liberty to put
   your track wherever you want, to make your own choice about how to
   approach mountains. He made backcountry skiing cool. And if you were a
   Teton skier -- then he really made you feel the pride."

   The avalanche danger was listed as moderate on Wednesday afternoon,
   according to the Bridger-Teton National Forest avalanche center. This
   tragedy brings the avalanche fatality number for the U.S. to 27 for
   this season.

   "Our thoughts and prayers go out to Chris and Steve's family and
   friends," said the release from Jackson Hole. "Please keep them in your
   thoughts."

Can the resourceful Rays really slay the mighty Astros?

   Tampa Bay played giant killer in cutting down Justin Verlander, and
   while the wild-card Rays face another tall task, it's hard to bet
   against them.

   MILWAUKEE -- A young and eager Giannis Antetokounmpo sat down to clack
   out a tweet.

   "I'll never leave the team and the city of Milwaukee till we build the
   team to a championship level ...," he wrote.

   It was the summer of 2014, and Antetokounmpo was a gangly, doe-eyed
   19-year-old who spent the year videotaping himself drinking smoothies
   for the first time and building muscle. He had finished seventh in
   Rookie of the Year voting.

   Fast forward five years: Antetokounmpo has blossomed into a physically
   imposing player and MVP favorite who led his team to the best record in
   the NBA.

   The Bucks had lived a charmed existence most of the 2018-19 season.
   They waltzed out to 60 wins, secured the 1-seed and bulldozed the
   Detroit Pistons in the first round of the playoffs.

   Milwaukee's first real trial was supposed to come against the Boston
   Celtics in the semifinals. Instead, the Bucks -- after dropping Game 1
   -- rattled off four consecutive wins to advance to the Eastern
   Conference finals for the first time since 2001.

   Then came the Raptors.

   After jumping out to a 2-0 series lead in the conference finals, the
   Bucks crumbled. Milwaukee lost four consecutive games and fell in six.

   In what would be their final game of the season Saturday, the Bucks led
   most of the game before unraveling late in the third quarter. The
   Raptors tied the game on a Serge Ibaka dunk with 10 minutes, 31 seconds
   left in the fourth quarter while Antetokounmpo was on the bench.

   Brook Lopez hit two free throws with 29.6 seconds remaining to make it
   97-94, but the Raptors finished it out at the free throw line to pull
   out a 100-94 victory and advance to their first NBA Finals, against the
   Golden State Warriors.

   Now, Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry and general manager Jon Horst are headed
   into an extraordinarily busy summer. The contracts of three starters --
   Khris Middleton, Lopez and Malcolm Brogdon -- need to be addressed. And
   they'll have to decide on the futures of George Hill and Nikola
   Mirotic, two key bench players, as they attempt to construct an even
   better team around their superstar.

   This week, Antetokounmpo qualified for a five-year, $247.3 million
   supermax extension, the largest in NBA history, by earning All-NBA
   honors for the second consecutive season. He can't accept that
   agreement until next summer, once he has seven years of NBA experience,
   a timeline that clearly puts Milwaukee on the clock this summer.

   Antetokounmpo has consistently made public proclamations of his love
   for Milwaukee, as he grew up and became acclimated to American culture
   in Cream City after moving from Greece. Antetokounmpo adores the Bucks
   medical staff. His mother moved to Milwaukee. But he is all about
   winning. In more concrete terms, a source close to Antetokounmpo said
   that getting to the NBA Finals is not just an ambition, it could tip
   the scales as he weighs his contractual future.

   And if they can reach the NBA Finals next season, the Bucks can improve
   their chances of signing Antetokounmpo to the supermax in the summer of
   2020.

   unrestricted free agent this summer, and bringing him back will be a
   priority for the Bucks. Gary Dineen/NBAE via Getty Images

   This season, the Bucks were built to win.

   Horst hired ex-Hawks head coach Mike Budenholzer on May 17, 2018. Horst
   upgraded the center position by replacing Thon Maker and John Henson
   with Lopez, a 3-point shooting 7-footer who could space the floor. He
   also signed Pat Connaughton, another shooter who could add depth to the
   Bucks' bench.

   At the Bucks coaches' summer retreat, Budenholzer laid out his vision
   for the season: Do everything to accentuate Antetokounmpo's strengths.
   Nix Middleton's long 2s in favor of 3s. Instruct Eric Bledsoe and
   Brogdon to shoot more 3s. Maintain spacing on the perimeter to allow
   for Antetokounmpo's dominance in the paint.

   "We really drilled that stuff," Lopez told ESPN in April. "Our offense
   is predicated on shooting."

   Horst also traded for Hill and Mirotic -- shooters with playoff
   experience.

   The Bucks finished the regular season No. 1 in defensive rating and No.
   4 in offensive rating. They attempted and made the second-most
   3-pointers per game in the league, and Antetokounmpo led the league in
   dunks.

   The Bucks didn't lose back-to-back games until March 2 and 4. They lost
   a close game to the Jazz in Utah, then dropped a game on the road to
   the Phoenix Suns. The locker room was glum after both losses, but
   Antetokounmpo vowed that his team would be better.

    The NBA's supermax contract is working ... just not like fans expected

   Determined not to lose three games in a row, the Bucks bounced back
   against the Pacers in Indianapolis on March 7.

   Antetokounmpo was issued a technical foul early on for being
   uncharacteristically vocal with the referees. Antetokounmpo credited
   his teammates with keeping control of the game when he lost his cool.

   "That's the guys you want to play with," Antetokounmpo said. "They know
   their role, and they try to do the best job they can every single
   night. You could feel it, we didn't want to lose a third game in a
   row."

   But which teammates will continue with Antetokounmpo in the Bucks'
   quest for a Finals appearance who could affect whether they keep their
   superstar when he's eligible for free agency in 2021?

   The Bucks likely will pay Middleton. After signing Bledsoe to a
   four-year, $70 million contract in March, retaining Brogdon would come
   with a hefty price that could send the Bucks into the luxury tax.
   Milwaukee also will need to choose among Mirotic, Hill and Lopez. It is
   unlikely that all three will be retained.

   Re-signing Lopez, league sources said, is a priority.

   Here's what lies ahead for the Bucks this summer. ESPN Stats &
   Information

   Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals was the team's first real test
   of the playoffs. The series was tied. The Bucks were back on their home
   court. It was a crucial game.

   After the Bucks squandered a 12-point lead with 7:43 left in the third,
   it came down to the final two minutes.

   Trailing by three with 1:12 to go in the game, Antetokounmpo rolled his
   ankle and Budenholzer pulled him from the game. Rather than take a seat
   on the bench, Antetokounmpo leaned up against the scorer's table and
   watched as Kawhi Leonard went to the line and split two free throws.

   This would have been a logical time for Budenholzer to call a timeout
   and reinsert his franchise player. Instead, the game went on without
   Antetokounmpo.

   When Antetokounmpo checked back in, the Bucks trailed 100-97 with 34.7
   seconds left, and it wouldn't get any closer.

   A deflated Antetokounmpo exited the court with a towel draped over his
   head. He sat in front of his locker munching on a postgame snack.
   Twenty minutes later, he explained that he was "pissed" and
   "frustrated" but vowed this wouldn't be the end for the Bucks.

   "We're the best team in the league," Antetokounmpo said. "We are not
   going to fold."

   The Bucks might have been the best team in the league during the
   regular season, but the Raptors were right behind them and ultimately
   proved to be superior in the postseason.

   Milwaukee made major strides this season and still has time to reach a
   Finals with Antetokounmpo. Even so, given Antetokounmpo's intense
   desire to win and his looming contract decision, the expectations and
   pressure are bound to increase next season.

   Schefter: Gordon is close to ending holdout (1:02)

   Adam Schefter discusses the timeline of when Melvin Gordon might end
   his holdout and return to the Chargers. (1:02)

   Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon could soon be moving up
   his reporting date, though no final decisions have been made, league
   sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

   Gordon had previously planned to return at some point in October, but
   circumstances have changed and Gordon senses the best way to show his
   value is on the field, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson.

   He must report no later than Nov. 29 to play in 2019 and accrue credit
   for this season toward becoming a free agent in the offseason.

   Without Gordon, the Chargers (1-2) rank 13th in the NFL with 111.7
   rushing yards per game. Austin Ekeler (160 yards this season) and
   Justin Jackson (142) have combined to fill the void.

   Gordon, 26, continues to hold out because of a contract impasse with
   the Chargers. Gordon's representation was granted permission by the
   Chargers to pursue a trade, but so far no deal has materialized.

   Gordon is scheduled to make $5.605 million in the final season of his
   rookie deal. Just before the season, Chargers general manager Tom
   Telesco announced that the team had postponed negotiations with Gordon
   until after the season. If Gordon chooses to report, he will play under
   his current contract.

   Gordon wants a contract extension that will compensate him similarly to
   top backs Todd Gurley, David Johnson and Le'Veon Bell, who earn an
   average of $13 million to $14 million annually. During training camp,
   the Chargers offered Gordon a new contract that would double his salary
   at roughly $10 million annually.

   The former first-round draft pick has rushed for 3,628 yards and has
   1,577 receiving yards with 38 total touchdowns in his first four
   seasons.

   ESPN's Eric D. Williams contributed to this report.

   ATLANTA -- It happened again. And this time it was in a postseason
   game.

   Atlanta Braves center fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. failed to run out a ball
   he hit off the wall in right field, settling for just a single. The
   last time it happened, in August, he was benched. This time, he was
   called out by his teammates after the Braves lost 7-6 to the St. Louis
   Cardinals in Game 1 of their best-of-five National League Division
   Series on Thursday.

   "Yeah, it's frustrating," Braves star first baseman Freddie Freeman
   said. "But I think you have that conversation once. It's kind of
   beating a dead horse after that if you keep having the same
   conversation over and over again. You have to know that was a mistake."

   Acuna connected off Cardinals reliever John Brebbia in the seventh, and
   right-fielder Dexter Fowler played it off the wall. By the time he
   turned to throw the ball back in, Acuna was just getting to first base.
   He didn't have much of an explanation for not running.

   "Things happen. Stuff like this doesn't happen to the one who is
   sitting on the bench," Acuna told ESPN's Enrique Rojas. "It could have
   been a double, but things happen. I didn't speak with the manager about
   it. I just went out to enjoy the game. I always try to give my best,
   but these are things that sometimes get away from me. They are not
   things I want to do. As players, we always try to give our best effort,
   but we make mistakes, we are human."

    'Best ever'? It sounds absurd, but Ronald Acuna Jr. isn't far off

   1 Related

   The inning could have turned out differently if Acuna was at second
   base. An Ozzie Albies groundout would have gotten him to third instead
   of second. He was eventually doubled off the bag when Josh Donaldson
   lined out to shortstop. In a one-run loss, the mistake loomed large.

   "He probably scores in that inning if he's on second base," Albies
   said. "It's a big deal. He knows he needs to do better there."

   The lack of hustle overshadowed Acuna's fantastic night at the plate,
   which included a walk and three hits, including a ninth-inning home
   run. But even the home run irked some; Cardinals reliever Carlos
   Martinez, who surrendered it, was upset at Acuna's home run trot.

   "I simply want him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran
   player," Martinez told reporters. "That's it. Just play the game."

   But in the Braves clubhouse, the focus was on the seventh-inning play.

   "He should have been on second," manager Brian Snitker said. "And we're
   kind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there. You hate to
   see that happen."

   Snitker pulled Acuna from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on
   Aug. 18, trying to make the point to the young star that running out
   every ball is important, even more so in October.

   "That can't happen in the playoffs," Freeman said. "Can't happen in the
   regular season. Unfortunately that happened tonight."

   Teammates didn't say anything publicly that they didn't say to Acuna
   first.

   "A couple guys told him, 'Yeah, just run out of the box,'" Albies
   relayed. "It's something you should do."

   Acuna was asked if he had another chance, would he do things
   differently.

   "Absolutely," he said. "I mean, I was trying to give my best effort and
   those are those things that just kind of get away from you. So,
   obviously, I would've loved to have a double, if I could take it back."

Two die in avalanche in the Tetons

   Two well-known backcountry skiers were killed on Wednesday in Wyoming's
   Grand Teton National Park. Park rangers found the bodies of Jackson
   Hole Mountain Resort employee Chris Onufer and ski mountaineer and
   blogger Steve Romeo on Thursday.

   Grand Teton National Park rangers and Teton County Search and Rescue
   initiated the search after being notified that two skiers failed to
   return home on Wednesday. They found the car of the missing skiers late
   Wednesday night in a trailhead parking lot 10 miles north of Moran
   Junction. They began an aerial reconnaissance flight to Ranger Peak at
   sunrise on Thursday.

   They located a large avalanche debris field on the slope of 11,355-foot
   Ranger Peak just before 9 a.m. and searchers aboard the helicopter
   received signals from two avalanche beacons. A physical search of the
   debris turned up the two missing skiers.

   According to a release from Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, Onufer began
   working at the ski area in 1993 and most recently worked as the manager
   of the tram maintenance department and was an integral figure in the
   development and installation of the new tram, which opened in December
   2008. "A class act and a quiet leader, Chris was humble and let his
   work and achievements speak for themselves, he will be missed by all at
   the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort and in the greater Jackson Hole and
   Teton Valley Communities," states the release.

   Steve Romeo was an avid ski mountaineer and randonee racer who ran a
   popular backcountry skiing blog, TetonAT.com. "There were two things
   that made Steve Romeo tick -- skiing and the Tetons," Romeo's friend
   and ski partner Zahan Billimoria told ESPN. "He was the consummate
   skier whose whole life revolved around making turns. It was really the
   wildness that I think he loved in the whole thing, the liberty to put
   your track wherever you want, to make your own choice about how to
   approach mountains. He made backcountry skiing cool. And if you were a
   Teton skier -- then he really made you feel the pride."

   The avalanche danger was listed as moderate on Wednesday afternoon,
   according to the Bridger-Teton National Forest avalanche center. This
   tragedy brings the avalanche fatality number for the U.S. to 27 for
   this season.

   "Our thoughts and prayers go out to Chris and Steve's family and
   friends," said the release from Jackson Hole. "Please keep them in your
   thoughts."

   MILWAUKEE -- A young and eager Giannis Antetokounmpo sat down to clack
   out a tweet.

   "I'll never leave the team and the city of Milwaukee till we build the
   team to a championship level ...," he wrote.

   It was the summer of 2014, and Antetokounmpo was a gangly, doe-eyed
   19-year-old who spent the year videotaping himself drinking smoothies
   for the first time and building muscle. He had finished seventh in
   Rookie of the Year voting.

   Fast forward five years: Antetokounmpo has blossomed into a physically
   imposing player and MVP favorite who led his team to the best record in
   the NBA.

   regular-season record in the NBA. AP Photo/Morry Gash

   The Bucks had lived a charmed existence most of the 2018-19 season.
   They waltzed out to 60 wins, secured the 1-seed and bulldozed the
   Detroit Pistons in the first round of the playoffs.

   Milwaukee's first real trial was supposed to come against the Boston
   Celtics in the semifinals. Instead, the Bucks -- after dropping Game 1
   -- rattled off four consecutive wins to advance to the Eastern
   Conference finals for the first time since 2001.

   Then came the Raptors.

   After jumping out to a 2-0 series lead in the conference finals, the
   Bucks crumbled. Milwaukee lost four consecutive games and fell in six.

   In what would be their final game of the season Saturday, the Bucks led
   most of the game before unraveling late in the third quarter. The
   Raptors tied the game on a Serge Ibaka dunk with 10 minutes, 31 seconds
   left in the fourth quarter while Antetokounmpo was on the bench.

   Brook Lopez hit two free throws with 29.6 seconds remaining to make it
   97-94, but the Raptors finished it out at the free throw line to pull
   out a 100-94 victory and advance to their first NBA Finals, against the
   Golden State Warriors.

   Now, Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry and general manager Jon Horst are headed
   into an extraordinarily busy summer. The contracts of three starters --
   Khris Middleton, Lopez and Malcolm Brogdon -- need to be addressed. And
   they'll have to decide on the futures of George Hill and Nikola
   Mirotic, two key bench players, as they attempt to construct an even
   better team around their superstar.

   This week, Antetokounmpo qualified for a five-year, $247.3 million
   supermax extension, the largest in NBA history, by earning All-NBA
   honors for the second consecutive season. He can't accept that
   agreement until next summer, once he has seven years of NBA experience,
   a timeline that clearly puts Milwaukee on the clock this summer.

   Antetokounmpo has consistently made public proclamations of his love
   for Milwaukee, as he grew up and became acclimated to American culture
   in Cream City after moving from Greece. Antetokounmpo adores the Bucks
   medical staff. His mother moved to Milwaukee. But he is all about
   winning. In more concrete terms, a source close to Antetokounmpo said
   that getting to the NBA Finals is not just an ambition, it could tip
   the scales as he weighs his contractual future.

   And if they can reach the NBA Finals next season, the Bucks can improve
   their chances of signing Antetokounmpo to the supermax in the summer of
   2020.

   unrestricted free agent this summer, and bringing him back will be a
   priority for the Bucks. Gary Dineen/NBAE via Getty Images

   This season, the Bucks were built to win.

   Horst hired ex-Hawks head coach Mike Budenholzer on May 17, 2018. Horst
   upgraded the center position by replacing Thon Maker and John Henson
   with Lopez, a 3-point shooting 7-footer who could space the floor. He
   also signed Pat Connaughton, another shooter who could add depth to the
   Bucks' bench.

   At the Bucks coaches' summer retreat, Budenholzer laid out his vision
   for the season: Do everything to accentuate Antetokounmpo's strengths.
   Nix Middleton's long 2s in favor of 3s. Instruct Eric Bledsoe and
   Brogdon to shoot more 3s. Maintain spacing on the perimeter to allow
   for Antetokounmpo's dominance in the paint.

   "We really drilled that stuff," Lopez told ESPN in April. "Our offense
   is predicated on shooting."

   Horst also traded for Hill and Mirotic -- shooters with playoff
   experience.

   The Bucks finished the regular season No. 1 in defensive rating and No.
   4 in offensive rating. They attempted and made the second-most
   3-pointers per game in the league, and Antetokounmpo led the league in
   dunks.

   The Bucks didn't lose back-to-back games until March 2 and 4. They lost
   a close game to the Jazz in Utah, then dropped a game on the road to
   the Phoenix Suns. The locker room was glum after both losses, but
   Antetokounmpo vowed that his team would be better.

   Determined not to lose three games in a row, the Bucks bounced back
   against the Pacers in Indianapolis on March 7.

   Antetokounmpo was issued a technical foul early on for being
   uncharacteristically vocal with the referees. Antetokounmpo credited
   his teammates with keeping control of the game when he lost his cool.

   "That's the guys you want to play with," Antetokounmpo said. "They know
   their role, and they try to do the best job they can every single
   night. You could feel it, we didn't want to lose a third game in a
   row."

   But which teammates will continue with Antetokounmpo in the Bucks'
   quest for a Finals appearance who could affect whether they keep their
   superstar when he's eligible for free agency in 2021?

   The Bucks likely will pay Middleton. After signing Bledsoe to a
   four-year, $70 million contract in March, retaining Brogdon would come
   with a hefty price that could send the Bucks into the luxury tax.
   Milwaukee also will need to choose among Mirotic, Hill and Lopez. It is
   unlikely that all three will be retained.

   Re-signing Lopez, league sources said, is a priority.

   Here's what lies ahead for the Bucks this summer. ESPN Stats &
   Information

   Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals was the team's first real test
   of the playoffs. The series was tied. The Bucks were back on their home
   court. It was a crucial game.

   After the Bucks squandered a 12-point lead with 7:43 left in the third,
   it came down to the final two minutes.

   Trailing by three with 1:12 to go in the game, Antetokounmpo rolled his
   ankle and Budenholzer pulled him from the game. Rather than take a seat
   on the bench, Antetokounmpo leaned up against the scorer's table and
   watched as Kawhi Leonard went to the line and split two free throws.

   This would have been a logical time for Budenholzer to call a timeout
   and reinsert his franchise player. Instead, the game went on without
   Antetokounmpo.

   When Antetokounmpo checked back in, the Bucks trailed 100-97 with 34.7
   seconds left, and it wouldn't get any closer.

   A deflated Antetokounmpo exited the court with a towel draped over his
   head. He sat in front of his locker munching on a postgame snack.
   Twenty minutes later, he explained that he was "pissed" and
   "frustrated" but vowed this wouldn't be the end for the Bucks.

   "We're the best team in the league," Antetokounmpo said. "We are not
   going to fold."

   The Bucks might have been the best team in the league during the
   regular season, but the Raptors were right behind them and ultimately
   proved to be superior in the postseason.

   Milwaukee made major strides this season and still has time to reach a
   Finals with Antetokounmpo. Even so, given Antetokounmpo's intense
   desire to win and his looming contract decision, the expectations and
   pressure are bound to increase next season.

Martinelli 9/10, Tierney 7/10 as newcomers shine for Arsenal in Europe

   [share-icon-fb.png] [share-icon-tw.png] [wapp.png]

   Arsenal romped to their second win of the Europa League group stage
   with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Standard Liege at the Emirates.
   Gabriel Martinelli scored twice inside 20 minutes, followed by goals by
   Joe Willock (22nd minuted) and Dani Ceballos (57th minute).

Positives

   There were first European starts of the season for Kieran Tierney and
   Hector Bellerin, with both putting in good showings, while young
   Martinelli looks a real find. The Brazilian was clinical in front of
   goal, and will be knocking on Unai Emery's door for some Premier League
   game time sooner rather than later.

Negatives

   There will be tougher tests to come for this Arsenal side on their
   quest for European glory, and the feeble threat offered by the Belgians
   meant some of the Gunners didn't even need to break sweat, which
   perhaps isn't ideal when it comes to gaining genuine match sharpness.

Manager rating out of 10

   7 -- Emery chose the right time to introduce Tierney and Bellerin, and
   his selection of a hungry front three paid dividends with a blistering
   attacking display, particularly in the first half.

Player ratings (1-10; 10 = best, players introduced after 70 minutes get no
rating)

   GK Emiliano Martinez, 6 -- Got away with some poor decision-making in
   the first half when engaging with some awkward crosses, but was never
   forced to make any testing saves against a blunt Liege attack.

   DF Hector Bellerin, 7 -- The Spaniard made his first start following a
   lengthy injury layoff, and was keen to get involved with his side's
   attacking play, while being completely untested in his own defensive
   third.

   DF Shkodran Mustafi, 6 -- One loose pass in the first half went
   unpunished in what was the only blemish on a comfortable evening. Three
   clean sheets in three appearances this season for the German.

   DF Rob Holding, 6 -- The centre-back was a virtual bystander for the
   duration as Liege offered close to no attacking threat.

   DF Kieran Tierney, 7 -- Brilliant work down the left and a great cross
   provided Martinelli with the ammunition to head home the Arsenal
   opener, in what was an impressive European bow for his new employers.

   MF Dani Ceballos, 7 -- The Real Madrid loanee knitted play together
   nicely in the final third and occasionally dropped deep to pick up the
   ball from the back four. Finally, capped off a good display with an
   easy tap-in to put his side four up.

   MF Lucas Torreira, 6 -- The Uruguayan returned to his preferred central
   role in the Arsenal midfield but was guilty of one or two sloppy
   moments in possession. Failed to make the Liege goalkeeper work with a
   free kick on the edge of the box.

   MF Joe Willock, 7 -- The academy graduate reacted quickly to set
   himself and glide the ball home to put the game to bed midway through
   the first half. Brought off for Matteo Guendouzi for the final 16
   minutes.

   MF Ainsley Maitland-Niles, 6 -- The 22-year-old was given a chance in
   his favoured right-wing role, but will be disappointed he couldn't have
   the same impact as the rest of his attacking colleagues. Released
   Martinelli in the penalty area on the way to Arsenal's fourth and was
   replaced by Nicolas Pepe in the 66th minute.

   MF Reiss Nelson, 7 -- Did well to work space out wide to supply the
   pass to Martinelli for Arsenal's second, and played his part in the
   third as his blocked shot fell to the feet of goalscorer Willock.
   Replaced in the 79th minute by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

   FW Gabriel Martinelli, 9 -- The 18-year-old got off the mark with an
   instinctive glancing header after 13 minutes, and followed it up with a
   superbly arrowed strike through a crowd of Liege bodies in the penalty
   area just minutes later. The Brazilian wasn't done there, providing a
   lovely dinked cross for Ceballos to poke home Arsenal's fourth.

Substitutes

   Nicolas Pepe, 6 -- Got himself involved with Arsenal's attacking play
   but was unable to add to the scoring.

   Matteo Guendouzi, N/R -- Slotted into the Arsenal midfield to keep play
   ticking over.

   Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, N/R -- The Gunners' supreme marksman didn't
   have quite enough time to get himself on the scoresheet in his brief
   cameo, but came close with a half-volley in the box in the closing
   stages.

RB Gordon could soon end holdout, sources say

   [ ]


   ESPNSep 25, 20192 Minute Read

Schefter: Gordon is close to ending holdout

   Adam Schefter discusses the timeline of when Melvin Gordon might end
   his holdout and return to the Chargers.

   Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon could soon be moving up
   his reporting date, though no final decisions have been made, league
   sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

   He must report no later than Nov. 29 to play in 2019 and accrue credit
   for this season toward becoming a free agent in the offseason.

   Without Gordon, the Chargers (1-2) rank 13th in the NFL with 111.7
   rushing yards per game. Austin Ekeler (160 yards this season) and
   Justin Jackson (142) have combined to fill the void.

   Gordon, 26, continues to hold out because of a contract impasse with
   the Chargers. Gordon's representation was granted permission by the
   Chargers to pursue a trade, but so far no deal has materialized.

   Gordon is scheduled to make $5.605 million in the final season of his
   rookie deal. Just before the season, Chargers general manager Tom
   Telesco announced that the team had postponed negotiations with Gordon
   until after the season. If Gordon chooses to report, he will play under
   his current contract.

   Gordon wants a contract extension that will compensate him similarly to
   top backs Todd Gurley, David Johnson and Le'Veon Bell, who earn an
   average of $13 million to $14 million annually. During training camp,
   the Chargers offered Gordon a new contract that would double his salary
   at roughly $10 million annually.

   Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon could soon be moving up
   his reporting date, though no final decisions have been made, league
   sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

   Gordon had previously planned to return at some point in October, but
   circumstances have changed and Gordon senses the best way to show his
   value is on the field, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson.

   He must report no later than Nov. 29 to play in 2019 and accrue credit
   for this season toward becoming a free agent in the offseason.

   Without Gordon, the Chargers (1-2) rank 13th in the NFL with 111.7
   rushing yards per game. Austin Ekeler (160 yards this season) and
   Justin Jackson (142) have combined to fill the void.

   Gordon, 26, continues to hold out because of a contract impasse with
   the Chargers. Gordon's representation was granted permission by the
   Chargers to pursue a trade, but so far no deal has materialized.

   Gordon is scheduled to make $5.605 million in the final season of his
   rookie deal. Just before the season, Chargers general manager Tom
   Telesco announced that the team had postponed negotiations with Gordon
   until after the season. If Gordon chooses to report, he will play under
   his current contract.

   Gordon wants a contract extension that will compensate him similarly to
   top backs Todd Gurley, David Johnson and Le'Veon Bell, who earn an
   average of $13 million to $14 million annually. During training camp,
   the Chargers offered Gordon a new contract that would double his salary
   at roughly $10 million annually.

   The former first-round draft pick has rushed for 3,628 yards and has
   1,577 receiving yards with 38 total touchdowns in his first four
   seasons.

Braves critical of Ronald Acuna Jr. for not running out hit in loss

   [ ]


   Jesse RogersESPN Staff WriterOct 3, 20193 Minute Read

Acuna responds to lack of hustle criticism

   Ronald Acuna Jr. addresses the concern around his lack of hustle, and
   Freddie Freeman admits Acuna not running out of the box in the seventh
   was frustrating.

   ATLANTA -- It happened again. And this time it was in a postseason
   game.

   "Yeah, it's frustrating," Braves star first baseman Freddie Freeman
   said. "But I think you have that conversation once. It's kind of
   beating a dead horse after that if you keep having the same
   conversation over and over again. You have to know that was a mistake."

   Acuna connected off Cardinals reliever John Brebbia in the seventh, and
   right-fielder Dexter Fowler played it off the wall. By the time he
   turned to throw the ball back in, Acuna was just getting to first base.
   He didn't have much of an explanation for not running.

   "Things happen. Stuff like this doesn't happen to the one who is
   sitting on the bench," Acuna told ESPN's Enrique Rojas. "It could have
   been a double, but things happen. I didn't speak with the manager about
   it. I just went out to enjoy the game. I always try to give my best,
   but these are things that sometimes get away from me. They are not
   things I want to do. As players, we always try to give our best effort,
   but we make mistakes, we are human."

   The inning could have turned out differently if Acuna was at second
   base. An Ozzie Albies groundout would have gotten him to third instead
   of second. He was eventually doubled off the bag when Josh Donaldson
   lined out to shortstop. In a one-run loss, the mistake loomed large.

   "He probably scores in that inning if he's on second base," Albies
   said. "It's a big deal. He knows he needs to do better there."

   "I simply want him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran
   player," Martinez told reporters. "That's it. Just play the game."

   But in the Braves clubhouse, the focus was on the seventh-inning play.

   "He should have been on second," manager Brian Snitker said. "And we're
   kind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there. You hate to
   see that happen."

   Snitker pulled Acuna from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on
   Aug. 18, trying to make the point to the young star that running out
   every ball is important, even more so in October.

   "That can't happen in the playoffs," Freeman said. "Can't happen in the
   regular season. Unfortunately that happened tonight."

   Teammates didn't say anything publicly that they didn't say to Acuna
   first.

   "A couple guys told him, 'Yeah, just run out of the box,'" Albies
   relayed. "It's something you should do."

   Acuna was asked if he had another chance, would he do things
   differently.

   "Absolutely," he said. "I mean, I was trying to give my best effort and
   those are those things that just kind of get away from you. So,
   obviously, I would've loved to have a double, if I could take it back."

   ATLANTA -- It happened again. And this time it was in a postseason
   game.

   Atlanta Braves center fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. failed to run out a ball
   he hit off the wall in right field, settling for just a single. The
   last time it happened, in August, he was benched. This time, he was
   called out by his teammates after the Braves lost 7-6 to the St. Louis
   Cardinals in Game 1 of their best-of-five National League Division
   Series on Thursday.

   "Yeah, it's frustrating," Braves star first baseman Freddie Freeman
   said. "But I think you have that conversation once. It's kind of
   beating a dead horse after that if you keep having the same
   conversation over and over again. You have to know that was a mistake."

   Acuna connected off Cardinals reliever John Brebbia in the seventh, and
   right-fielder Dexter Fowler played it off the wall. By the time he
   turned to throw the ball back in, Acuna was just getting to first base.
   He didn't have much of an explanation for not running.

   "Things happen. Stuff like this doesn't happen to the one who is
   sitting on the bench," Acuna told ESPN's Enrique Rojas. "It could have
   been a double, but things happen. I didn't speak with the manager about
   it. I just went out to enjoy the game. I always try to give my best,
   but these are things that sometimes get away from me. They are not
   things I want to do. As players, we always try to give our best effort,
   but we make mistakes, we are human."

    'Best ever'? It sounds absurd, but Ronald Acuna Jr. isn't far off

   The inning could have turned out differently if Acuna was at second
   base. An Ozzie Albies groundout would have gotten him to third instead
   of second. He was eventually doubled off the bag when Josh Donaldson

   "He probably scores in that inning if he's on second base," Albies
   said. "It's a big deal. He knows he needs to do better there."

   The lack of hustle overshadowed Acuna's fantastic night at the plate,
   which included a walk and three hits, including a ninth-inning home
   run. But even the home run irked some; Cardinals reliever Carlos
   Martinez, who surrendered it, was upset at Acuna's home run trot.

   "I simply want him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran
   player," Martinez told reporters. "That's it. Just play the game."

   But in the Braves clubhouse, the focus was on the seventh-inning play.

   "He should have been on second," manager Brian Snitker said. "And we're
   kind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there. You hate to

   those are those things that just kind of get away from you. So,
   obviously, I would've loved to have a double, if I could take it back."
