Transcript

   This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

   AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and
   Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue the hour with
   world-renowned linguist, political dissident Noam Chomsky, who spoke
   last night here in Boston at the Old South Church.

     NOAM CHOMSKY: I want to make a couple of remarks below about the
     severe difficulty of maintaining and instituting democracy, the
     powerful forces that have always opposed it, the achievements of
     somehow salvaging and enhancing it, and the significance of that for
     the future. But first, a couple of words about the challenges that
     we face, which you heard enough about already and you all know
     about. I don’t have to go into them in detail. To describe these
     challenges as “extremely severe” would be an error. The phrase does
     not capture the enormity of the kinds of challenges that lie ahead.
     And any serious discussion of the future of humanity must begin by
     recognizing a critical fact, that the human species is now facing a
     question that has never before arisen in human history, question
     that has to be answered quickly: Will human society survive for
     long?

     Well, as you all know, for 70 years we’ve been living under the
     shadow of nuclear war. Those who have looked at the record can only
     be amazed that we’ve survived this far. Time after time it’s come
     extremely close to terminal disaster, even minutes away. It’s kind
     of a miracle that we’ve survived. Miracles don’t go on forever. This
     has to be terminated, and quickly. The recent Nuclear Posture Review
     of the Trump administration dramatically increases the threat of
     conflagration, which would in fact be terminal for the species. We
     may remember that this Nuclear Posture Review was sponsored by Jim
     Mattis, who was regarded as too civilized to be retained in the
     administration—gives you a sense of what can be tolerated in the
     Trump-Pompeo-Bolton world.

     Well, there were three major arms treaties: the ABM Treaty,
     Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty; the INF Treaty, Intermediate Nuclear
     Forces; the New START treaty.

     The U.S. pulled out of the ABM Treaty in 2002. And anyone who
     believes that anti-ballistic missiles are defensive weapons is
     deluded about the nature of these systems.

     The U.S. has just pulled out of the INF Treaty, established by
     Gorbachev and Reagan in 1987, which sharply reduced the threat of
     war in Europe, which would very quickly spread. The background of
     that signing of that treaty was the demonstrations that you just saw
     depicted on the film. Massive public demonstrations were the
     background for leading to a treaty that made a very significant
     difference. It’s worth remembering that and many other cases where
     significant popular activism has made a huge difference. The lessons
     are too obvious to enumerate. Well, the Trump administration has
     just withdrawn from the INF Treaty; the Russians withdrew right
     afterwards. If you take a close look, you find that each side has a
     kind of a credible case saying that the opponent has not lived up to
     the treaty. For those who want a picture of how the Russians might
     look at it, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the major journal on
     arms control issues, had a lead article a couple weeks ago by
     Theodore Postol pointing out how dangerous the U.S. installations of
     anti-ballistic missiles on the Russian border—how dangerous they are
     and can be perceived to be by the Russians. Notice, on the Russian
     border. Tensions are mounting on the Russian border. Both sides are
     carrying out provocative actions. We should—in a rational world,
     what would happen would be negotiations between the two sides, with
     independent experts to evaluate the charges that each is making
     against the other, to lead to a resolution of these charges, restore
     the treaty. That’s a rational world. But it’s unfortunately not the
     world we’re living in. No efforts at all have been made in this
     direction. And they won’t be, unless there is significant pressure.

     Well, that leaves the New START treaty. The New START treaty has
     already been designated by the figure in charge, who has modestly
     described himself as the greatest president in American history—he
     gave it the usual designation of anything that was done by his
     predecessors: the worst treaty that ever happened in human history;
     we’ve got to get rid of it. If in fact—this comes up for renewal
     right after the next election, and a lot is at stake. A lot is at
     stake in whether that treaty will be renewed. It has succeeded in
     very significantly reducing the number of nuclear weapons, to a
     level way above what they ought to be but way below what they were
     before. And it could go on.

     Well, meanwhile, global warming proceeds on its inexorable course.
     During this millennium, every single year, with one exception, has
     been hotter than the last one. There are recent scientific papers,
     James Hansen and others, which indicate that the pace of global
     warming, which has been increasing since about 1980, may be sharply
     escalating and may be moving from linear growth to exponential
     growth, which means doubling every couple of decades. We’re already
     approaching the conditions of 125,000 years ago, when the sea level
     was about roughly 25 feet higher than it is today, with the melting,
     the rapid melting, of the Antarctic, huge ice fields. We might—that
     point might be reached. The consequences of that are almost
     unimaginable. I mean, I won’t even try to depict them, but you can
     figure out quickly what that means.

     Well, meanwhile, while this is going on, you regularly read in the
     press euphoric accounts of how the United States is advancing in
     fossil fuel production. It’s now surpassed Saudi Arabia. We’re in
     the lead of fossil fuel production. The big banks, JPMorgan Chase
     and others, are pouring money into new investments in fossil fuels,
     including the most dangerous, like Canadian tar sands. And this is
     all presented with great euphoria, excitement. We’re now reaching
     energy independence. We can control the world, determine the use of
     fossil fuels in the world.

     Barely a word on what the meaning of this is, which is quite
     obvious. It’s not that the reporters, commentators don’t know about
     it, that the CEO of the banks don’t know about it. Of course they
     do. But these are kind of institutional pressures that just are
     extremely hard to extricate themselves from. You can put yourself in
     the—try to put yourself in the position of, say, the CEO of JPMorgan
     Chase, the biggest bank, which is spending large sums in investment
     in fossil fuels. He certainly knows everything that you all know
     about global warming. It’s no secret. But what are the choices?
     Basically he has two choices. One choice is to do exactly what he’s
     doing. The other choice is to resign and be replaced by somebody
     else who will do exactly what he’s doing. It’s not an individual
     problem. It’s an institutional problem, which can be met, but only
     under tremendous public pressure.

     And we’ve recently seen, very dramatically, how it can—how the
     solution can be reached. A group of young people, Sunrise Movement,
     organized, got to the point of sitting in in congressional offices,
     aroused some interest from the new progressive figures who were able
     to make it to Congress. Under a lot of popular pressure, Alexandria
     Ocasio-Cortez, joined by Ed Markey, actually placed the Green New
     Deal on the agenda. That’s a remarkable achievement. Of course, it
     gets hostile attacks from everywhere: It doesn’t matter. A couple of
     years ago it was unimaginable that it would be discussed. As the
     result of the activism of this group of young people, it’s now right
     in the center of the agenda. It’s got to be implemented in one form
     or another. It’s essential for survival, maybe not in exactly that
     form, but some modification of it. Tremendous change achieved by the
     commitment of a small group of young people. That tells you the kind
     of thing that can be done.

     Meanwhile, the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
     last January was set at two minutes to midnight. That’s the closest
     it’s been to terminal disaster since 1947. The announcement of the
     settlement—of the setting mentioned the two major familiar threats:
     the threat of nuclear war, which is increasing, threat of global
     warming, which is increasing further. And it added a third for the
     first time: the undermining of democracy. That’s the third threat,
     along with global warming and nuclear war. And that was quite
     appropriate, because functioning democracy offers the only hope of
     overcoming these threats. They are not going to be dealt with by
     major institutions, state or private, acting without massive public
     pressure, which means that the means of democratic functioning have
     to be kept alive, used the way the Sunshine Movement did it, the way
     the great mass demonstration in the early ’80s did it, and the way
     we continue today.
