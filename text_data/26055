   I discovered @stationhq last night and loved it so much I‚Äôve been
   recommending it to my team, friends, former co-workers, etc. So far
   everyone has absolutely loved it. It‚Äôs making my work sooooo much
   easier!

   Did @stationhq just integrate @notionhq?! Hint: Yes, it's truly a GAME
   CHANGER. But really, these two tools that have changed my work over the
   last few months. Would recommend. 10/10

   If you use a computer for work and use web apps (think Google Suite, MS
   Office, Atlassian, etc.), please check out @stationhq - it has made my
   workflow sooo much faster & easier, and it uncluttered my browser

   Absolutely loving @stationhq on macOS thus far. Brings everything work
   related across disparate apps onto a single, tabbed window. Very
   responsive. UI/UX little rough on edges but shows great promise.
   Already a daily driver for work! #workflow

   As a developer I like @stationhq because they are developing their
   product with eagerness. As updates come once a week, it has improved in
   no time. It's my great inspiration for developing an iOS app in a short
   term.
