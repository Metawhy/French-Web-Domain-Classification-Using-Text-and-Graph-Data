Artistic Pratice Catalog

Artistic Practice Department

   The Artistic Practice Department is made up of 26 studios run by École
   faculty members, all renowned artists. The studio is a space for
   practice, experimentation, creation; also for debate, exchange and
   critique.

   And at certain moments of the year — student evaluations and graduation
   — it becomes an exhibition space.

   Students must enroll in an Artistic Practice studio each and every
   semester. First-year and other new students are encouraged to meet with
   several studio artist-professors at the beginning of the school year
   before choosing their studio, with studio professor’s agreement.
   Students may remain in the same studio throughout the five years or
   change studios depending on the direction their work is taking and with
   the agreement of the professors in charge.

   The studio is both a physical and mental space for art training.
   Students of all levels—first to fifth year—cohabit in it, usually
   practicing pluridisciplinary creation techniques. Studio teaching
   methods combine personalized attention and the collective dimension of
   exchange; the aim is to foster students’ individual commitment to their
   art by helping them gradually to construct a personal artistic
   language. Theoretical, critical and technical knowledge and know-how
   intersect and mutually enrich students’ art work while helping each to
   situate himself or herself within a network of meanings and
   interpretations.

   Interstudio relations are developed through joint temporary hangings
   and critique sessions, which increase opportunities for dialogue and
   nourish students’ thinking. Often studio  professors invite other
   artists to the studio. Studio groups may also travel abroad, usually to
   one of the École’s partner art schools. Studio professors also organize
   conferences and develop collective exhibition projects in collaboration
   with other institutions.
   These experiences give students opportunities to tackle the matters of
   positioning their creations in space, communication, diffusion and
   publication.
