Our Verdict

   F1 2019 retains immaculate handling and visuals while adding cinematic
   spectacle and junior series racing.

NEED TO KNOW

   What is it? The latest licensed F1 racer, now with added cutscenes.

   It seems so obvious now in retrospect. The best way for an annualised,
   licensed motorsport game to stay fresh every summer, clearly, is to
   chuck in an entirely different racing series as well. With the
   inclusion of the 2018 F2 championship, F1 2019 feels, for the first
   time in the series, like a wider world of motorsport. It offers that
   irresistible rags-to-riches journey in career mode, and a handling
   model all of its own to master.

   It makes a lot of sense. Codemasters has had the handling down for
   years now. It's twitchy and frightening, and gives you just the right
   amount of rumble in your hands as you wrestle your car implausibly fast
   over an impeccably rendered apex. It feels in this game, as it has for
   many prior instalments, like a carefully struck balance between
   detailed physics modelling and 'sim-cade' accessibility.

   But the developers needed to add something more than a few handling
   tweaks, and that's a story-driven career mode. Elsewhere in sports
   gaming, this kind of ascendancy through the junior ranks up to the big
   league is becoming de rigeur. And for the twelve other people who play
   the underrated MotoGP series as religiously as this one (see you at the
   next bridge game, folks) it's deliciously ironic to see Codemasters
   borrow an idea from Milestone for a change—Moto2 and Moto3 categories
   have formed the entry point for MotoGP's own career mode for many years
   now.

   F1 2019's career mode is a bit of a surprise, though. Rather than a
   full season of F2 racing, it's a scripted sequence of condensed race
   highlights akin to Codemasters' beloved TOCA: Race Driver, and it
   serves as a prelude to your F1 career. Fictionalised drivers Lukas
   Weber and Devon Butler mix with familiar names like Russell, Norris and
   Ghiotto, and the former are very much cut from the 'broadly drawn
   racing stereotype' cloth. Cocksure English villain with waggly
   eyebrows: step forward, Devon. Bavarian stickler for rules and
   procedure: take a bow, Mr Weber.

   That's not necessarily to the detriment of this potted F2 season
   matinee. What is, however, is the fact it's over so quickly. Barely
   half an hour passes before you're spat out of the other side of F2 and
   picking an F1 team. Granted, not everyone wants to get stuck into a
   full race calendar—and indeed it’s possible to do so in a separate F2
   season mode which has no bearing on your career, but it would have been
   nice to have the option of working a bit harder for your F1 race seat.
   As it is, choosing your F2 team determines the level of interest you'll
   receive from various F1 teams, so your choice does at least feeling
   meaningful even if the season's fleeting.

   When you graduate to the big cars, the career mode format takes on a
   familiar complexion from last year’s game. It's once again gratifying
   to earn the trust of your team by hitting their performance targets. As
   you move forward you gain access to the RPG-like car upgrade tree and
   spend points to improve your car. My Williams was in dire need of aero
   upgrades in my debut season for example, whereas the Renault-powered
   teams need to find engine performance to bridge the gap to Mercedes.
   That kind of granular detail in its simulation of the sport has long
   separated the F1 series from other licensed racers, and it remains
   impressive in this game.

     Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
     hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   That’s the format. But there’s a twist in the tale: Lukas Weber and
   Devon Butler graduate to F1 along with you, replacing two real drivers
   and popping up in cutscenes which amp up the sense of rivalry (and, to
   be honest, am-dram theatre). Butler and Weber are free to drive
   wherever the game takes them. They might even become your team-mate at
   some point.

   Yes, it all seems very silly if you sit watching the cutscenes like
   Roger Ebert expecting Oscar-worthy spectacle. But this rivals plotline
   really does work: you feel motivated not just to win a contract with
   the race-winning teams, but now to do so before your contemporaries.
   Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
   hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   Changes are afoot over in multiplayer too, with a focus on visual
   customisation. Custom car liveries have been introduced, along with
   team-agnostic overalls and gloves. So rather than each multiplayer
   event being a game of F1 cosplay you’re free to express yourself—if you
   can afford the cosmetic items. Most are possible to unlock by spending
   in-game currency accrued elsewhere, but a few appear to be
   microtransaction-only affairs. At the time of writing, we’re unable to
   click through to the Steam Store to see how they’re priced.

   A new leagues system and improved race highlights mode both bolster F1
   2019’s eSports cred, which is good news for pro sim racers and those
   aspiring to be the next Brendon Leigh alike. I’m still not totally sold
   on the virtual stewards and how they dole out penalties, but I’ve yet
   to play a racing sim online that has cracked that particular nut
   agreeably.

   This isn’t a tangible leap forward in the fundamentals of the F1
   series—the handling and visuals remain roughly where they were last
   year, which is to say: excellent. What Codemasters have managed to add
   into the series in an impressively short span though is a wealth of new
   solo content that enriches career mode and offers a totally different
   challenge outside it. Many more hours of online racing will be needed
   before the strength of its infrastructure can be commented on—but at
   release, F1 2019 is generous, stable, and thrilling as ever.

   Correction: A previous version of this review implied that drivers
   wouldn't change teams. In fact, driver transfers are fully supported.

   Breezy fun that also rewards combo-chasing mastery. Barrel through the
   story once for a laugh, then replay the best levels until you are John
   Wick on a skateboard.

   The gamers running at me have swords, because all gamers own swords, I
   guess. They also have Monty Python Dark Souls cosplay armor, but it
   can't save them from the shotgun blasts that reduce them to lumps at my
   feet. I'm out of ammo before I'm out of gamers, the last one charging
   with sword held high. But any object you kick is a one-shot kill in
   this game, and dead gamer lumps are kickable objects.

   There are more impressive gun-fu stunts in My Friend Pedro than
   breaking somebody's neck by kicking their dead friend's torso at them,
   but this moment of improvisation is typical of what happens between
   gif-able highlights. Once or twice per level I'll do something like
   skateboard through a window and then kick that skateboard at someone
   while shooting someone else, or I'll throw a frying pan into the air
   and then ricochet bullets off it to clear a room.

   But the meat and potatoes of My Friend Pedro isn't these set pieces.
   It's jumping in and relying on the combination of a generous slow-mo
   meter, physics objects, and a lot of bullets to see you through.

This shit is bananas

   I should mention the talking banana. His name is Pedro and he's full of
   potassium and advice on how to kill people, whether retired mafiosi or
   Christmas-themed bounty hunters or gamers driven to madness by violent
   videogames. There's a story in My Friend Pedro but a minimal one—it
   feels like the plot of another hyperviolent Devolver game, Ruiner, only
   told on fast-forward. Pedro is there to explain things, but more
   importantly he appears in the corner of the screen when you pull off a
   high-scoring combo and tells you what rank you got at the end of a
   level.

   It's a score-attack game, with bonus points for chaining together kills
   in combos. There are leaderboards, and I have replayed several levels
   just to get a higher rank than James. (Suck it, James.) Chasing high
   scores makes me look ahead at a level and think things like, "I should
   ride the barrel onto that guy then jump off while dual-wielding and
   split my fire so I can shoot that one and the other before I land."

   Split-fire looked neat in the gifs Pedro's designer showed off during
   development, but I was worried it would feel rough in play. I was super
   wrong. It's easy: right-click on one dude and hold to lock him in, and
   then for every left-click shot, no matter where it's aimed, the
   right-click guy gets a bullet as well. Levels that drop you down shafts
   with enemies on both sides, or have doors full of goons opening around
   you, are built for this. I never stopped enjoying it.

   IFRAME: https://gfycat.com/ifr/bravecarefreedouglasfirbarkbeetle

   These are also fine moments for dodging by pressing W, which sends you
   into a bulletproof pirouette. Shooting while dodging sends bullets
   flying in whichever direction your guns happen to be pointing during
   that part of the animation, wild sprays flying around as you whirl
   about like a dog in a tumble dryer. Again: enjoyable.

   Later levels reduce the number of physics objects like skateboards,
   basketballs, and knives, as well as goons to fling them at, in favor of
   mines, lasers, spinning platforms, and traps that require more
   perfectionist play. There's not as much freedom to rack up combos and a
   lot more falling to your death. They're less fun to replay, and I wish
   there were notes in the level select screen that said "this level is
   cool and has a skateboard" or "this one has too many lasers". There's
   one in the dream-like midsection with no enemies, a pure platforming
   challenge that doesn't play to My Friend Pedro's strengths.

   So some levels are weaker, but before long there's always a refresher
   level that plays completely differently, a motorbike chase or a
   freefall or a boss fight. To pay My Friend Pedro the highest
   compliment, its boss fights didn't annoy me. They're bombastic,
   inventive, and they're over fast.

   Along with the score, at the end of every level Pedro gives you a gif
   of a highlight to save or share. Postcards from murderland, they slice
   My Friend Pedro into a handful of enjoyable seconds. Its take on
   bullet-time is fun for more than seconds, though. Unlike Superhot or
   Max Payne I never got tired of its bullet-time thanks to short levels,
   high variety, and a storyline that's purest nonsense.

Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers review

The next expansion in Square Enix's MMO is easily the best yet.

Our Verdict

   Coupled with a striking new world to explore, Shadowbringers' poignant
   and character-driven story is one of the best in the entire series.

Need to know

   What is it? A bleak and story-heavy expansion to Square Enix's great
   MMO.

   Nearly a month ago I wrote that Final Fantasy 14 was my favorite MMO
   that I hate to recommend. Playing it requires an enormous investment of
   time—at least a few hundred hours—and even though I love it, I worried
   that others might ultimately find that long journey boring and
   unsatisfying. But after beating Shadowbringers, Final Fantasy 14's
   latest expansion, those worries are gone.

   Shadowbringers is the Avengers: Endgame of Final Fantasy 14, an
   emotionally stirring climax that draws on six years of character
   development, storytelling, and worldbuilding to weave an epic,
   dimension-spanning story rooted in the relationships of its chief
   characters.

Paint it black

     It's these long and meandering character arcs that make my
     adventures feel so epic in scale, like if Game of Thrones was a
     high-fantasy anime.

   If you're not familiar with Final Fantasy 14's story, it's difficult to
   describe Shadowbringers' premise without spoiling everything that comes
   before. With three expansions and hundreds of hours of story under its
   belt, the world of Final Fantasy 14 is so complicated and nuanced you
   should be able to get a degree in its history. It's intimidating to
   newcomers—especially because the first part of Final Fantasy 14's
   overarching story is a slow burn—but as a long-time player I love how
   rich and vast the world and its characters have become.

   The gist is that, after the events of Stormblood, the world of Hydaelyn
   is on the precipice of an apocalyptic war orchestrated by the evil
   Ascians, immortal beings who want to see the world plunged into chaos
   as a means to revive their dark god. To help tip the first domino, the
   Ascians are hoping to cause an apocalypse in an alternate dimension
   that'll cascade into Hydaelyn itself. My companions and I have to
   adventure to this alternate dimension, called The First, to save it and
   in turn save Hydaelyn. It's exactly the sort of plot you'd expect from
   Brainiac, Dr. Doom, or Thanos, only wrapped up in an anime-inspired
   high-fantasy aesthetic.

   But unlike Hydaelyn, where I'm constantly fighting the forces of
   darkness, The First has the opposite problem: A century earlier
   darkness was defeated, giving rise to an abundance of primordial light
   that has almost wiped out the entire planet and spawned an army of
   divine monsters called Sin Eaters. To save The First, I have to swap
   sides and become the Warrior of Darkness, a quest that explores the
   powers of light and darkness beyond whether they are merely good or
   evil.

   Shadowbringers' success is, in part, owed to the way Square Enix has
   carefully built the world of Final Fantasy 14 over these past six
   years. Though previous expansions have always been a direct
   continuation of the main story, the scope of Shadowbringers is almost
   dizzying by comparison. Characters, lore, and story beats that have
   been left to simmer for years suddenly boil over in dramatic narrative
   twists and turns that make this 50-hour journey an absolute
   rollercoaster.

   When the hero Arbert first appeared all the way back in Heavensward as
   a minor character, for example, I never could have imagined the pivotal
   role he would grow to have in Shadowbringers. It's these long and
   meandering character arcs that make my adventures feel MMO-sized, like
   if Game of Thrones was a high-fantasy anime.

   Despite being an MMO, Shadowbringers does a remarkable job of emulating
   that golden era of JRPGs through well-written dialogue and evocative
   cutscenes. If you hate fetch quests in MMOs, Shadowbringers
   unfortunately has those in spades but I hardly cared because the
   context of those quests—and the cutscenes that often followed—were so
   enticing.

   Shadowbringers' eclectic cast is one of its best strengths.

     Emet Selch could easily be the best nemesis of any Final Fantasy
     game since FF6's Kekfa.

   The writing and voice acting has been steadily improving since A Realm
   Reborn, but the bleakness of Shadowbringers casts the drama in a much
   more mature, and at times disturbing, new light. One early quest led me
   to a sanitorium full of people who had been infected with the light
   and, in time, would turn into Sin Eaters. Without a cure, the
   caretakers' only option was to delay the inevitable and then euthanize
   them. Elsewhere, the city Eulmore is full of upper-class elite living
   in excess as they wait for the impending apocalypse while, just outside
   the walls, the poor, sick, and starving waste away.

   Shadowbringers addresses these heavy subjects well in the face of Final
   Fantasy's extensive melodrama, but my favorite part of the story is how
   much depth it adds to my cast of longtime companions. Thancred's story
   is especially gut-wrenching and brings a bittersweet end to one of
   FF14's longest character arcs.

   Even better was Shadowbringers' ploy to have the MMO's grand villain,
   Emet Selch, tag along for most of the adventure. Few stories ever
   manage to make me sympathize with a villain while still retaining what
   makes them detestable, but Emet Selch could be the best Final Fantasy
   nemesis since FF6's Kekfa. He's batshit crazy but so charismatic and
   likeable that I wish we didn't have to be enemies.

Black in action

   Though its story is the best reason to play, Shadowbringers adds a lot
   of other neat features. The new Gunbreaker and Dancer are both fun new
   jobs (FF14 parlance for classes) that each have a distinct playstyle
   and the new bunny-like Vi and tiger-esque Hrothgar character races are
   natural additions to the world (though I hate how many bikini-clad Vi
   I'm seeing everywhere now).

   (Image credit: Square Enix)

   These features are less exciting only because they so closely follow
   the same template that Square Enix has laid out since Heavensward.
   Instead of overhauling core game systems with each expansion like World
   of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14 tends to play it safe. While that makes
   the addition of new jobs, raids, and other features feel somewhat
   predictable, I don't mind since everything is consistently good and
   fun—especially the new dungeons, which are some of my favorite out of
   any expansion so far.

   The story tees up each dungeon and single-boss raid (called Trials) so
   well, turning each one into a climactic finale for each zone-specific
   questline. After spending so long in the barren, gritty deserts of
   Stormblood's areas, the dungeons and zones of Shadowbringers are a
   visual feast. Il Mheg and its accompanying dungeon of Dohn Mheg are my
   two favorites.

   The former is an entire area stripped straight out of The Dark Crystal,
   an enchanting land full of playful fairies and a colony of talking
   dog-birds ruled over by a fairy king who also happens to be a Sin
   Eater. To supplant her, I had to complete the dungeon of Dohn Mheg, a
   vibrant underwater dreamland ruled over by a top-hat wearing frog
   spirit.

   It's unlike anything else in Final Fantasy 14, but instead of clashing
   with the bleak story of Shadowbringers' other areas, it ends up being a
   welcome reprieve capped off with a grueling battle against the fairy
   king herself. Shadowbringers continues FF14's legacy for astounding
   music and flashy spell effects that make each boss fight memorable and
   thrilling.

   If there's one area that Final Fantasy 14 is struggling with, it's in
   job balance and design, though. Shadowbringers reworked nearly every
   job, pruning old abilities while also adding some new ones. Most of the
   damage-dealing jobs are improved by these changes, but as a White Mage
   it's disappointing to see some of my favorite spells taken away and
   replaced with a new healing system that doesn't add any complexity to
   combat. Instead, I'm just waiting for a meter to slowly fill so I can
   cast the associated spell.

   That isn't to say combat in Shadowbringers isn't fun. Shadowbringers'
   new raid bosses are still the best out of any MMO—demanding excellent
   team coordination while delivering an explosive spectacle that makes
   each fight feel tense and exciting.

   Since Final Fantasy 14 relaunched six years ago, Square Enix has also
   kept up a good tempo of major updates every three or four months.
   Assuming Shadowbringers continues that template I'm excited to see
   where it goes next. But its main story is already so good that
   Shadowbringers is worth playing even if you have no intention of
   committing hundreds of more hours grinding raid bosses for loot drops.
   Final Fantasy 14 is quietly one of the best games in the series, but
   Shadowbringers elevates it even further by telling a bleak and
   heartfelt tale that generously rewards the investment made by its most
   hardcore fans.

The Verdict

Final Fantasy 14

   Coupled with a striking new world to explore, Shadowbringers' poignant
   and character-driven story is one of the best in the entire series.

Our Verdict

   A flexible roguelike with more than enough playstyles to keep you
   coming back.

Need to Know

   What is it? A chaotic rogue-like with endless player choice.
   Expect to pay: $20 / £15.50
   Developer: Matt Dabrowski
   Publisher: tinyBuild
   Reviewed on: i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050Ti, 8GB RAM
   Multiplayer: Up to four-player co-op, both online and local
   Link: Official Site

   On my first run, I'm an assassin, backstabbing enemies and slinging
   shuriken. Then I'm a jock, barrelling through walls and swinging a
   baseball bat. Next, I'm a gorilla, flanked by three other primates,
   tearing scientists apart with my bare hands in the middle of downtown.
   Somehow, I avoid the patrolling cops on that last one, probably because
   I’d injected two of my companions with an invisibility serum—plus,
   there was a riot in the streets, turning the level into a mosh pit of
   gang fights, enraged shop owners, and firefighters whacking office
   workers with axes.

   In the brilliant, bananas 2D roguelike Streets of Rogue, you play as
   one of 26 characters, killing targets and stealing macguffins from
   guarded buildings. After you finish all your missions you take the
   elevator to the next procedurally-generated floor, and keep going until
   you die or reach the end. Missions are formulaic and repeat often, and
   the world doesn’t feel all that different between stages despite a few
   new buildings and NPC types, but what makes Streets of Rogue special,
   and unpredictable, is the unique traits of each character, which
   constantly create new, surprising interactions with the world.

Cannibals and vampires

   Streets of Rogue is designed in the style of an immersive sim, in that
   each character has multiple ways to approach any given situation. As
   the hacker, I’m asked to kill a member of the blue gang, the Crepes.
   He’s surrounded by buddies, and as a scrawny nerd I’m no good with my
   fists or a pistol. There are no nearby turrets I can program to target
   him and no computers to blow up in his face, which are two of my usual
   tricks. Instead, I hire him as a bodyguard for the rest of the level,
   walk to the other side of town, and dive into a den of red gang Blahds,
   who gun him down without blinking. Job done.

   After a zombie infestation special event cuts that run short, I choose
   the cannibal, who regenerates health by munching corpses. On the third
   floor, I have to steal a wallet from a chest in the back room of a bar.
   But bartenders don’t like cannibals, and if I try to walk in I’ll be
   bounced out by him and his customers. I could blow a hole in the wall
   with a grenade, but everyone outside will see. Instead, I pour a vial
   of a mystery liquid into the air filtration system, which saps their
   strength. I burst through the door and beat them bloody, gorge on their
   bodies, and help myself to the wallet, ignoring the wailing camera on
   the wall.

   (Image credit: Matt Dabrowski/tinyBuildE)

     It’s a build-your-own roguelike, basically, and you can make it as
     hard or as easy as you like.

   As well as randomised missions, each character has their own optional
   ‘big quest’, and if you complete its task on each of a run’s 15 levels
   you receive a new permanent ability for that class. They’re often the
   highlight of a run. The bartender has to make and serve three drinks to
   different NPCs on each level, and each recipe has its own effect on the
   drinker, enraging them, poisoning them, or making them super fast. The
   firefighter’s big quest is to extinguish fires set by arsonists, who
   only appear if you choose that character.

   These quests, and the unique traits of each character, make picking a
   new class feel like playing a completely different game. With the
   assassin, who can go invisible and chain stab enemies, I’m playing a
   slow-burn stealth game. With the soldier and their machinegun, it’s a
   top-down shooter. Streets of Rogue is not groundbreaking as either, but
   being able to choose between 26 different playstyles makes it hard to
   stop playing. I still have a handful of characters to unlock, including
   a vampire who must kill a hidden werewolf on each level.

   And after 15 hours, I’m still finding new ways to use characters I
   thought I’d mastered. I only just realised, for example, that hackers
   can hack fridges to make them literally ‘run’ (geddit?), flattening
   anyone in their path and then bursting open to reveal the food inside,
   which restores HP. I also just discovered eating burnt bodies restores
   more HP as the cannibal, so I buy a flamethrower whenever I can.

Mutations

   Even if you stick with one character, each run takes on its own
   personality thanks to the items you find in shops, chests and safes, as
   well as the traits you pick up between levels. Finishing a floor lets
   you choose a trait from a list of three, and you can push for a
   specific playstyle by picking traits that match. I pair a trait that
   lets me recruit extra followers with one that gives followers more
   health to start a roving gang that can win almost any fight.

   Streets of Rogue also boasts a huge list of custom rules, called
   mutators, that you can toggle on and off, and you can decide exactly
   which traits and items appear in the unlock pool. It’s a build-your-own
   roguelike, basically, and you can make it as hard or as easy as you
   like. After a series of slower runs I turned on bigger bullets,
   exploding bodies, and faster move speed. It’s utter chaos.

   (Image credit: Matt Dabrowski/tinyBuildE)

     I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a comedian can do if you
     give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and an inventory full of
     bacon cheeseburgers.

   There are a few things I find bothersome. Commanding your companions is
   fiddly, but if you don’t micromanage them they’ll run off and get
   themselves killed. It’s too easy to get into buildings by knocking on
   the door, waiting for the person to answer and ducking inside as soon
   as they turn around. As I mentioned, the levels are uninspiring—each
   three-floor stage has a different skin, but the changes never really
   affect the action. And the four-player co-op isn’t much fun with
   strangers because distractions scatter players in different
   directions.

   The inclusion of slavery feels entirely out of place, too. Most levels
   have slavemasters that you can buy slaves from, and you can unlock the
   slavemaster as a playable character. In a game with a caricatured world
   where chicken nuggets are a black market currency, the inclusion of
   slavery is jarring, especially when the slaves make jokes (“Hey,
   remember when you literally owned me? Wow, those were the days…”).

   Those sticking points aside, Streets of Rogue is absolutely worth
   playing, and once you start, it’s hard to stop. It gives you more
   freedom than almost any roguelike, and its varied cast of characters,
   combined with the randomness of traits and mutators, mean no two runs
   play out the same way.

   Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a
   comedian can do if you give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and
   an inventory full of bacon cheeseburgers.

Dicey Dungeons forges one RNG to rule them all.

Our Verdict

   Endearing, compulsive, and just weird enough to want to keep exploring.

Need to know

   What is it? A crossbreed of CCG and roguelike dungeon-crawling.
   Expect to pay: $15/£11.39
   Developer: Terry Cavanagh
   Publisher: Terry Cavanagh
   Reviewed on: i5 6500, RTX 2080 TI, 32GB RAM
   Multiplayer? None
   Link: Official site

   Dicey Dungeons rolls you a few dice, presents you with cards which
   harness those dice in damage-dealing or character-buffing fashion, and
   pits you against a series of opponents in an offbeat dungeon-crawling
   RPG setting. It feels vaguely like playing a CCG while wearing x-ray
   specs.

   The roguelikes and card games Dicey Dungeons is referencing with its
   art and design would hide away their RNG elements, but Terry Cavanagh’s
   new game puts the dice under a spotlight. Quite literally: the setup is
   that of a gameshow, so while you’re fighting sneezy hedgehogs and
   sharply dressed hammerhead sharks there’s a studio audience gasping and
   cheering over it all. They ooh and aah when you open chests in its
   simple dungeon maps. There’s even a wheel of fortune. Those disparate
   elements—rolling dice, D&D-inspired questing, and the gameshows of
   yesteryear—shouldn’t gel together, but somehow it all feels like the
   most natural thing in the world while you’re playing.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

   Cavanagh’s previous games, VVVVVV and Super Hexagon, were about
   attritional runs against a conceptually simple but supremely demanding
   challenge. This—well, this is not. It’s actually all rather friendly,
   starting you off with a tutorial and building on itself very gradually
   with each encounter. And sure, rolling two dice and dragging them over
   into two weapon card slots to deal damage might not sound captivating
   on paper, but every new element it introduces makes you stop for a
   second and re-evaluate where this is all leading.

   Within the opening hour you’re dealing out shock, fire, and freezing
   damage, locking opponents’ dice, and firing off double-attacks when
   your limit break bar fills up from taking damage. And crucially, you
   feel like some kind of mastermind tactician while you do it.

   That’s the trick in Dicey Dungeons. You’re always being given the
   chance to make a smart decision, whether it’s holding off on doing
   damage to pool some dice into a healing card—these are activated on
   hitting a certain high number, say 16—or using buffs to hit exact
   numbers required by status effect cards. I’m convinced there’s still
   another layer of RNG beneath the hood that makes for the most
   entertaining fights—I mean, the Loud Bird I encountered at level 5
   rolled one double, an even and two dice under 5 every round when I
   fought him—but with the information you have, there are always
   opportunities to pull off something that feels clever.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

     At some point you’re certain to pause and wonder how you ended up
     putting such brainpower into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   At the end of each dungeon run is a boss and a new unlockable
   character. Bosses offer surprisingly little challenge though, and are
   sometimes outmatched by one or two of the enemies you had to best on
   the way to them. It's unusually lenient from the developer who made
   surviving for ten seconds in Super Hexagon feel like a
   once-in-a-lifetime feat of skill. Nevertheless, with the boss roasted
   and a new character for the taking, it’s back to the dungeons for a
   series of ever-escalating challenges.

   There’s a deceptively massive chunk of game here, and if the likes of
   Hearthstone or Gwent never clicked with you it’s an easy way to slide
   into the world of agonising over deck builds. You only have space for a
   handful of cards, but striking the right balance between attack,
   defense, and modifiers is just as engrossing. At some point you’re
   certain to pause and wonder how you ended up putting such brainpower
   into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

   Like an over-eager Tinder date, the vibe is very much casual and
   lighthearted at first, but before too long you’re made aware that the
   expectation is absolutely that of a long-term prospect. Unlike a
   stranger you swiped on the internet though, Dicey Dungeons doesn’t keep
   liking your Instagram posts months after you stop playing it.

   And, to jettison that analogy entirely before it’s stretched well
   beyond its limit, it does a surprisingly good job of world-building.
   When you fight a Baby Squid, its attacks involve squirting ink which
   blinds you to some of your dice. Hedgehogs use a lot of spikes. The
   aforementioned Loud Bird uses sound to its advantage. This is all via
   the medium of dice rolls, you understand, but it’s easy to be pulled
   into the surreal ‘90s cartoon-like world just the same.

   Longer term play is limited by the absence of multiplayer, but as a
   slice of solo deck-building Dicey Dungeons is engrossing, not to
   mention buoyed by great art and presentation. I do feel that faint itch
   to just load up Gwent and tend to my decks there instead when I play,
   but Gwent doesn’t look anywhere near as much like Ren & Stimpy as this.

F1 2019 review

With scripted drama and F2 racing, F1 2019 tells a compelling motorsport
story.

Our Verdict

   F1 2019 retains immaculate handling and visuals while adding cinematic
   spectacle and junior series racing.

NEED TO KNOW

   What is it? The latest licensed F1 racer, now with added cutscenes.
   Reviewed on i5 8600k, RTX 2080 ti, 16GB RAM
   Expect to pay $60 / £45
   Developer Codemasters
   Publisher Codemasters
   Multiplayer Up to 20 players
   Link Official site

   It seems so obvious now in retrospect. The best way for an annualised,
   licensed motorsport game to stay fresh every summer, clearly, is to
   chuck in an entirely different racing series as well. With the
   inclusion of the 2018 F2 championship, F1 2019 feels, for the first
   time in the series, like a wider world of motorsport. It offers that
   irresistible rags-to-riches journey in career mode, and a handling
   model all of its own to master.

   It makes a lot of sense. Codemasters has had the handling down for
   years now. It's twitchy and frightening, and gives you just the right
   amount of rumble in your hands as you wrestle your car implausibly fast
   over an impeccably rendered apex. It feels in this game, as it has for
   many prior instalments, like a carefully struck balance between
   detailed physics modelling and 'sim-cade' accessibility.

   But the developers needed to add something more than a few handling
   tweaks, and that's a story-driven career mode. Elsewhere in sports
   gaming, this kind of ascendancy through the junior ranks up to the big
   league is becoming de rigeur. And for the twelve other people who play
   the underrated MotoGP series as religiously as this one (see you at the
   next bridge game, folks) it's deliciously ironic to see Codemasters
   borrow an idea from Milestone for a change—Moto2 and Moto3 categories
   have formed the entry point for MotoGP's own career mode for many years
   now.

   F1 2019's career mode is a bit of a surprise, though. Rather than a
   full season of F2 racing, it's a scripted sequence of condensed race
   highlights akin to Codemasters' beloved TOCA: Race Driver, and it
   serves as a prelude to your F1 career. Fictionalised drivers Lukas
   Weber and Devon Butler mix with familiar names like Russell, Norris and
   Ghiotto, and the former are very much cut from the 'broadly drawn
   racing stereotype' cloth. Cocksure English villain with waggly
   eyebrows: step forward, Devon. Bavarian stickler for rules and
   procedure: take a bow, Mr Weber.

   That's not necessarily to the detriment of this potted F2 season
   matinee. What is, however, is the fact it's over so quickly. Barely
   half an hour passes before you're spat out of the other side of F2 and
   picking an F1 team. Granted, not everyone wants to get stuck into a
   full race calendar—and indeed it’s possible to do so in a separate F2
   season mode which has no bearing on your career, but it would have been
   nice to have the option of working a bit harder for your F1 race seat.
   As it is, choosing your F2 team determines the level of interest you'll
   receive from various F1 teams, so your choice does at least feeling
   meaningful even if the season's fleeting.

   When you graduate to the big cars, the career mode format takes on a
   familiar complexion from last year’s game. It's once again gratifying
   to earn the trust of your team by hitting their performance targets. As
   you move forward you gain access to the RPG-like car upgrade tree and
   spend points to improve your car. My Williams was in dire need of aero
   upgrades in my debut season for example, whereas the Renault-powered
   teams need to find engine performance to bridge the gap to Mercedes.
   That kind of granular detail in its simulation of the sport has long
   separated the F1 series from other licensed racers, and it remains
   impressive in this game.

     Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
     hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   That’s the format. But there’s a twist in the tale: Lukas Weber and
   Devon Butler graduate to F1 along with you, replacing two real drivers
   and popping up in cutscenes which amp up the sense of rivalry (and, to
   be honest, am-dram theatre). Butler and Weber are free to drive
   wherever the game takes them. They might even become your team-mate at
   some point.

   Yes, it all seems very silly if you sit watching the cutscenes like
   Roger Ebert expecting Oscar-worthy spectacle. But this rivals plotline
   really does work: you feel motivated not just to win a contract with
   the race-winning teams, but now to do so before your contemporaries.
   Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
   hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   Changes are afoot over in multiplayer too, with a focus on visual
   customisation. Custom car liveries have been introduced, along with
   team-agnostic overalls and gloves. So rather than each multiplayer
   event being a game of F1 cosplay you’re free to express yourself—if you
   can afford the cosmetic items. Most are possible to unlock by spending
   in-game currency accrued elsewhere, but a few appear to be
   microtransaction-only affairs. At the time of writing, we’re unable to
   click through to the Steam Store to see how they’re priced.

   A new leagues system and improved race highlights mode both bolster F1
   2019’s eSports cred, which is good news for pro sim racers and those
   aspiring to be the next Brendon Leigh alike. I’m still not totally sold
   on the virtual stewards and how they dole out penalties, but I’ve yet
   to play a racing sim online that has cracked that particular nut
   agreeably.

   This isn’t a tangible leap forward in the fundamentals of the F1
   series—the handling and visuals remain roughly where they were last
   year, which is to say: excellent. What Codemasters have managed to add
   into the series in an impressively short span though is a wealth of new
   solo content that enriches career mode and offers a totally different
   challenge outside it. Many more hours of online racing will be needed
   before the strength of its infrastructure can be commented on—but at
   release, F1 2019 is generous, stable, and thrilling as ever.

   Correction: A previous version of this review implied that drivers
   wouldn't change teams. In fact, driver transfers are fully supported.

Our Verdict

   Breezy fun that also rewards combo-chasing mastery. Barrel through the
   story once for a laugh, then replay the best levels until you are John
   Wick on a skateboard.

   The gamers running at me have swords, because all gamers own swords, I
   guess. They also have Monty Python Dark Souls cosplay armor, but it
   can't save them from the shotgun blasts that reduce them to lumps at my
   feet. I'm out of ammo before I'm out of gamers, the last one charging
   with sword held high. But any object you kick is a one-shot kill in
   this game, and dead gamer lumps are kickable objects.

   There are more impressive gun-fu stunts in My Friend Pedro than
   breaking somebody's neck by kicking their dead friend's torso at them,
   but this moment of improvisation is typical of what happens between
   gif-able highlights. Once or twice per level I'll do something like
   skateboard through a window and then kick that skateboard at someone
   while shooting someone else, or I'll throw a frying pan into the air
   and then ricochet bullets off it to clear a room.

   But the meat and potatoes of My Friend Pedro isn't these set pieces.
   It's jumping in and relying on the combination of a generous slow-mo
   meter, physics objects, and a lot of bullets to see you through.

This shit is bananas

   I should mention the talking banana. His name is Pedro and he's full of
   potassium and advice on how to kill people, whether retired mafiosi or
   Christmas-themed bounty hunters or gamers driven to madness by violent
   videogames. There's a story in My Friend Pedro but a minimal one—it
   feels like the plot of another hyperviolent Devolver game, Ruiner, only
   told on fast-forward. Pedro is there to explain things, but more
   importantly he appears in the corner of the screen when you pull off a
   high-scoring combo and tells you what rank you got at the end of a
   level.

   It's a score-attack game, with bonus points for chaining together kills
   in combos. There are leaderboards, and I have replayed several levels
   just to get a higher rank than James. (Suck it, James.) Chasing high
   scores makes me look ahead at a level and think things like, "I should
   ride the barrel onto that guy then jump off while dual-wielding and
   split my fire so I can shoot that one and the other before I land."

   Split-fire looked neat in the gifs Pedro's designer showed off during
   development, but I was worried it would feel rough in play. I was super
   wrong. It's easy: right-click on one dude and hold to lock him in, and
   then for every left-click shot, no matter where it's aimed, the
   right-click guy gets a bullet as well. Levels that drop you down shafts
   with enemies on both sides, or have doors full of goons opening around
   you, are built for this. I never stopped enjoying it.

   IFRAME: https://gfycat.com/ifr/bravecarefreedouglasfirbarkbeetle

   These are also fine moments for dodging by pressing W, which sends you
   into a bulletproof pirouette. Shooting while dodging sends bullets
   flying in whichever direction your guns happen to be pointing during
   that part of the animation, wild sprays flying around as you whirl
   about like a dog in a tumble dryer. Again: enjoyable.

   Later levels reduce the number of physics objects like skateboards,
   basketballs, and knives, as well as goons to fling them at, in favor of
   mines, lasers, spinning platforms, and traps that require more
   perfectionist play. There's not as much freedom to rack up combos and a
   lot more falling to your death. They're less fun to replay, and I wish
   there were notes in the level select screen that said "this level is
   cool and has a skateboard" or "this one has too many lasers". There's
   one in the dream-like midsection with no enemies, a pure platforming
   challenge that doesn't play to My Friend Pedro's strengths.

   So some levels are weaker, but before long there's always a refresher
   level that plays completely differently, a motorbike chase or a
   freefall or a boss fight. To pay My Friend Pedro the highest
   compliment, its boss fights didn't annoy me. They're bombastic,
   inventive, and they're over fast.

   Along with the score, at the end of every level Pedro gives you a gif
   of a highlight to save or share. Postcards from murderland, they slice
   My Friend Pedro into a handful of enjoyable seconds. Its take on
   bullet-time is fun for more than seconds, though. Unlike Superhot or
   Max Payne I never got tired of its bullet-time thanks to short levels,
   high variety, and a storyline that's purest nonsense.

Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers review

The next expansion in Square Enix's MMO is easily the best yet.

Our Verdict

   Coupled with a striking new world to explore, Shadowbringers' poignant
   and character-driven story is one of the best in the entire series.

Need to know

   What is it? A bleak and story-heavy expansion to Square Enix's great
   MMO.
   Expect to pay: $40 + $15/mo subscription fee
   Developer: Square Enix
   Publisher: Square Enix
   Reviewed on: Windows 10, Core i7-8700, 32GB RAM, GeForce RTX 2070
   Multiplayer: MMO
   Link: https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/shadowbringers/

   Nearly a month ago I wrote that Final Fantasy 14 was my favorite MMO
   that I hate to recommend. Playing it requires an enormous investment of
   time—at least a few hundred hours—and even though I love it, I worried
   that others might ultimately find that long journey boring and
   unsatisfying. But after beating Shadowbringers, Final Fantasy 14's
   latest expansion, those worries are gone.

   Shadowbringers is the Avengers: Endgame of Final Fantasy 14, an
   emotionally stirring climax that draws on six years of character
   development, storytelling, and worldbuilding to weave an epic,
   dimension-spanning story rooted in the relationships of its chief
   characters.

Paint it black

     It's these long and meandering character arcs that make my
     adventures feel so epic in scale, like if Game of Thrones was a
     high-fantasy anime.

   If you're not familiar with Final Fantasy 14's story, it's difficult to
   describe Shadowbringers' premise without spoiling everything that comes
   before. With three expansions and hundreds of hours of story under its
   belt, the world of Final Fantasy 14 is so complicated and nuanced you
   should be able to get a degree in its history. It's intimidating to
   newcomers—especially because the first part of Final Fantasy 14's
   overarching story is a slow burn—but as a long-time player I love how
   rich and vast the world and its characters have become.

   The gist is that, after the events of Stormblood, the world of Hydaelyn
   is on the precipice of an apocalyptic war orchestrated by the evil
   Ascians, immortal beings who want to see the world plunged into chaos
   as a means to revive their dark god. To help tip the first domino, the
   Ascians are hoping to cause an apocalypse in an alternate dimension
   that'll cascade into Hydaelyn itself. My companions and I have to
   adventure to this alternate dimension, called The First, to save it and
   in turn save Hydaelyn. It's exactly the sort of plot you'd expect from
   Brainiac, Dr. Doom, or Thanos, only wrapped up in an anime-inspired
   high-fantasy aesthetic.

   But unlike Hydaelyn, where I'm constantly fighting the forces of
   darkness, The First has the opposite problem: A century earlier
   darkness was defeated, giving rise to an abundance of primordial light
   that has almost wiped out the entire planet and spawned an army of
   divine monsters called Sin Eaters. To save The First, I have to swap
   sides and become the Warrior of Darkness, a quest that explores the
   powers of light and darkness beyond whether they are merely good or
   evil.

   Shadowbringers' success is, in part, owed to the way Square Enix has
   carefully built the world of Final Fantasy 14 over these past six
   years. Though previous expansions have always been a direct
   continuation of the main story, the scope of Shadowbringers is almost
   dizzying by comparison. Characters, lore, and story beats that have
   been left to simmer for years suddenly boil over in dramatic narrative
   twists and turns that make this 50-hour journey an absolute
   rollercoaster.

   When the hero Arbert first appeared all the way back in Heavensward as
   a minor character, for example, I never could have imagined the pivotal
   role he would grow to have in Shadowbringers. It's these long and
   meandering character arcs that make my adventures feel MMO-sized, like
   if Game of Thrones was a high-fantasy anime.

   Despite being an MMO, Shadowbringers does a remarkable job of emulating
   that golden era of JRPGs through well-written dialogue and evocative
   cutscenes. If you hate fetch quests in MMOs, Shadowbringers
   unfortunately has those in spades but I hardly cared because the
   context of those quests—and the cutscenes that often followed—were so
   enticing.

   Shadowbringers' eclectic cast is one of its best strengths.

     Emet Selch could easily be the best nemesis of any Final Fantasy
     game since FF6's Kekfa.

   The writing and voice acting has been steadily improving since A Realm
   Reborn, but the bleakness of Shadowbringers casts the drama in a much
   more mature, and at times disturbing, new light. One early quest led me
   to a sanitorium full of people who had been infected with the light
   and, in time, would turn into Sin Eaters. Without a cure, the
   caretakers' only option was to delay the inevitable and then euthanize
   them. Elsewhere, the city Eulmore is full of upper-class elite living
   in excess as they wait for the impending apocalypse while, just outside
   the walls, the poor, sick, and starving waste away.

   Shadowbringers addresses these heavy subjects well in the face of Final
   Fantasy's extensive melodrama, but my favorite part of the story is how
   much depth it adds to my cast of longtime companions. Thancred's story
   is especially gut-wrenching and brings a bittersweet end to one of
   FF14's longest character arcs.

   Even better was Shadowbringers' ploy to have the MMO's grand villain,
   Emet Selch, tag along for most of the adventure. Few stories ever
   manage to make me sympathize with a villain while still retaining what
   makes them detestable, but Emet Selch could be the best Final Fantasy
   nemesis since FF6's Kekfa. He's batshit crazy but so charismatic and
   likeable that I wish we didn't have to be enemies.

Black in action

   Though its story is the best reason to play, Shadowbringers adds a lot
   of other neat features. The new Gunbreaker and Dancer are both fun new
   jobs (FF14 parlance for classes) that each have a distinct playstyle
   and the new bunny-like Vi and tiger-esque Hrothgar character races are
   natural additions to the world (though I hate how many bikini-clad Vi
   I'm seeing everywhere now).

   (Image credit: Square Enix)

   These features are less exciting only because they so closely follow
   the same template that Square Enix has laid out since Heavensward.
   Instead of overhauling core game systems with each expansion like World
   of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14 tends to play it safe. While that makes
   the addition of new jobs, raids, and other features feel somewhat
   predictable, I don't mind since everything is consistently good and
   fun—especially the new dungeons, which are some of my favorite out of
   any expansion so far.

   The story tees up each dungeon and single-boss raid (called Trials) so
   well, turning each one into a climactic finale for each zone-specific
   questline. After spending so long in the barren, gritty deserts of
   Stormblood's areas, the dungeons and zones of Shadowbringers are a
   visual feast. Il Mheg and its accompanying dungeon of Dohn Mheg are my
   two favorites.

   The former is an entire area stripped straight out of The Dark Crystal,
   an enchanting land full of playful fairies and a colony of talking
   dog-birds ruled over by a fairy king who also happens to be a Sin
   Eater. To supplant her, I had to complete the dungeon of Dohn Mheg, a
   vibrant underwater dreamland ruled over by a top-hat wearing frog
   spirit.

   It's unlike anything else in Final Fantasy 14, but instead of clashing
   with the bleak story of Shadowbringers' other areas, it ends up being a
   welcome reprieve capped off with a grueling battle against the fairy
   king herself. Shadowbringers continues FF14's legacy for astounding
   music and flashy spell effects that make each boss fight memorable and
   thrilling.

   If there's one area that Final Fantasy 14 is struggling with, it's in
   job balance and design, though. Shadowbringers reworked nearly every
   job, pruning old abilities while also adding some new ones. Most of the
   damage-dealing jobs are improved by these changes, but as a White Mage
   it's disappointing to see some of my favorite spells taken away and
   replaced with a new healing system that doesn't add any complexity to
   combat. Instead, I'm just waiting for a meter to slowly fill so I can
   cast the associated spell.

   That isn't to say combat in Shadowbringers isn't fun. Shadowbringers'
   new raid bosses are still the best out of any MMO—demanding excellent
   team coordination while delivering an explosive spectacle that makes
   each fight feel tense and exciting.

   Since Final Fantasy 14 relaunched six years ago, Square Enix has also
   kept up a good tempo of major updates every three or four months.
   Assuming Shadowbringers continues that template I'm excited to see
   where it goes next. But its main story is already so good that
   Shadowbringers is worth playing even if you have no intention of
   committing hundreds of more hours grinding raid bosses for loot drops.
   Final Fantasy 14 is quietly one of the best games in the series, but
   Shadowbringers elevates it even further by telling a bleak and
   heartfelt tale that generously rewards the investment made by its most
   hardcore fans.

Our Verdict

   A flexible roguelike with more than enough playstyles to keep you
   coming back.

Need to Know

   What is it? A chaotic rogue-like with endless player choice.
   Expect to pay: $20 / £15.50
   Developer: Matt Dabrowski
   Publisher: tinyBuild
   Reviewed on: i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050Ti, 8GB RAM
   Multiplayer: Up to four-player co-op, both online and local
   Link: Official Site

   On my first run, I'm an assassin, backstabbing enemies and slinging
   shuriken. Then I'm a jock, barrelling through walls and swinging a
   baseball bat. Next, I'm a gorilla, flanked by three other primates,
   tearing scientists apart with my bare hands in the middle of downtown.
   Somehow, I avoid the patrolling cops on that last one, probably because
   I’d injected two of my companions with an invisibility serum—plus,
   there was a riot in the streets, turning the level into a mosh pit of
   gang fights, enraged shop owners, and firefighters whacking office
   workers with axes.

   In the brilliant, bananas 2D roguelike Streets of Rogue, you play as
   one of 26 characters, killing targets and stealing macguffins from
   guarded buildings. After you finish all your missions you take the
   elevator to the next procedurally-generated floor, and keep going until
   you die or reach the end. Missions are formulaic and repeat often, and
   the world doesn’t feel all that different between stages despite a few
   new buildings and NPC types, but what makes Streets of Rogue special,
   and unpredictable, is the unique traits of each character, which
   constantly create new, surprising interactions with the world.

Cannibals and vampires

   Streets of Rogue is designed in the style of an immersive sim, in that
   each character has multiple ways to approach any given situation. As
   the hacker, I’m asked to kill a member of the blue gang, the Crepes.
   He’s surrounded by buddies, and as a scrawny nerd I’m no good with my
   fists or a pistol. There are no nearby turrets I can program to target
   him and no computers to blow up in his face, which are two of my usual
   tricks. Instead, I hire him as a bodyguard for the rest of the level,
   walk to the other side of town, and dive into a den of red gang Blahds,
   who gun him down without blinking. Job done.

   After a zombie infestation special event cuts that run short, I choose
   the cannibal, who regenerates health by munching corpses. On the third
   floor, I have to steal a wallet from a chest in the back room of a bar.
   But bartenders don’t like cannibals, and if I try to walk in I’ll be
   bounced out by him and his customers. I could blow a hole in the wall
   with a grenade, but everyone outside will see. Instead, I pour a vial
   of a mystery liquid into the air filtration system, which saps their
   strength. I burst through the door and beat them bloody, gorge on their
   bodies, and help myself to the wallet, ignoring the wailing camera on
   the wall.

     It’s a build-your-own roguelike, basically, and you can make it as
     hard or as easy as you like.

   As well as randomised missions, each character has their own optional
   ‘big quest’, and if you complete its task on each of a run’s 15 levels
   you receive a new permanent ability for that class. They’re often the
   highlight of a run. The bartender has to make and serve three drinks to
   different NPCs on each level, and each recipe has its own effect on the
   drinker, enraging them, poisoning them, or making them super fast. The
   firefighter’s big quest is to extinguish fires set by arsonists, who
   only appear if you choose that character.

   These quests, and the unique traits of each character, make picking a
   new class feel like playing a completely different game. With the
   assassin, who can go invisible and chain stab enemies, I’m playing a
   slow-burn stealth game. With the soldier and their machinegun, it’s a
   top-down shooter. Streets of Rogue is not groundbreaking as either, but
   being able to choose between 26 different playstyles makes it hard to
   stop playing. I still have a handful of characters to unlock, including
   a vampire who must kill a hidden werewolf on each level.

   And after 15 hours, I’m still finding new ways to use characters I
   thought I’d mastered. I only just realised, for example, that hackers
   can hack fridges to make them literally ‘run’ (geddit?), flattening
   anyone in their path and then bursting open to reveal the food inside,
   which restores HP. I also just discovered eating burnt bodies restores
   more HP as the cannibal, so I buy a flamethrower whenever I can.

Mutations

   Even if you stick with one character, each run takes on its own
   personality thanks to the items you find in shops, chests and safes, as
   well as the traits you pick up between levels. Finishing a floor lets
   you choose a trait from a list of three, and you can push for a
   specific playstyle by picking traits that match. I pair a trait that
   lets me recruit extra followers with one that gives followers more
   health to start a roving gang that can win almost any fight.

   Streets of Rogue also boasts a huge list of custom rules, called
   mutators, that you can toggle on and off, and you can decide exactly
   which traits and items appear in the unlock pool. It’s a build-your-own
   roguelike, basically, and you can make it as hard or as easy as you
   like. After a series of slower runs I turned on bigger bullets,
   exploding bodies, and faster move speed. It’s utter chaos.

     I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a comedian can do if you
     give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and an inventory full of
     bacon cheeseburgers.

   There are a few things I find bothersome. Commanding your companions is
   fiddly, but if you don’t micromanage them they’ll run off and get
   themselves killed. It’s too easy to get into buildings by knocking on
   the door, waiting for the person to answer and ducking inside as soon
   as they turn around. As I mentioned, the levels are uninspiring—each
   three-floor stage has a different skin, but the changes never really
   affect the action. And the four-player co-op isn’t much fun with
   strangers because distractions scatter players in different
   directions.

   The inclusion of slavery feels entirely out of place, too. Most levels
   have slavemasters that you can buy slaves from, and you can unlock the
   slavemaster as a playable character. In a game with a caricatured world
   where chicken nuggets are a black market currency, the inclusion of
   slavery is jarring, especially when the slaves make jokes (“Hey,
   remember when you literally owned me? Wow, those were the days…”).

   Those sticking points aside, Streets of Rogue is absolutely worth
   playing, and once you start, it’s hard to stop. It gives you more
   freedom than almost any roguelike, and its varied cast of characters,
   combined with the randomness of traits and mutators, mean no two runs
   play out the same way.

   Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a
   comedian can do if you give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and
   an inventory full of bacon cheeseburgers.

Our Verdict

   Endearing, compulsive, and just weird enough to want to keep exploring.

Need to know

   What is it? A crossbreed of CCG and roguelike dungeon-crawling.
   Expect to pay: $15/£11.39
   Developer: Terry Cavanagh
   Publisher: Terry Cavanagh
   Reviewed on: i5 6500, RTX 2080 TI, 32GB RAM
   Multiplayer? None
   Link: Official site

   Dicey Dungeons rolls you a few dice, presents you with cards which
   harness those dice in damage-dealing or character-buffing fashion, and
   pits you against a series of opponents in an offbeat dungeon-crawling
   RPG setting. It feels vaguely like playing a CCG while wearing x-ray
   specs.

   The roguelikes and card games Dicey Dungeons is referencing with its
   art and design would hide away their RNG elements, but Terry Cavanagh’s
   new game puts the dice under a spotlight. Quite literally: the setup is
   that of a gameshow, so while you’re fighting sneezy hedgehogs and
   sharply dressed hammerhead sharks there’s a studio audience gasping and
   cheering over it all. They ooh and aah when you open chests in its
   simple dungeon maps. There’s even a wheel of fortune. Those disparate
   elements—rolling dice, D&D-inspired questing, and the gameshows of
   yesteryear—shouldn’t gel together, but somehow it all feels like the
   most natural thing in the world while you’re playing.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

   Cavanagh’s previous games, VVVVVV and Super Hexagon, were about
   attritional runs against a conceptually simple but supremely demanding
   challenge. This—well, this is not. It’s actually all rather friendly,
   starting you off with a tutorial and building on itself very gradually
   with each encounter. And sure, rolling two dice and dragging them over
   into two weapon card slots to deal damage might not sound captivating
   on paper, but every new element it introduces makes you stop for a
   second and re-evaluate where this is all leading.

   Within the opening hour you’re dealing out shock, fire, and freezing
   damage, locking opponents’ dice, and firing off double-attacks when
   your limit break bar fills up from taking damage. And crucially, you
   feel like some kind of mastermind tactician while you do it.

   That’s the trick in Dicey Dungeons. You’re always being given the
   chance to make a smart decision, whether it’s holding off on doing
   damage to pool some dice into a healing card—these are activated on
   hitting a certain high number, say 16—or using buffs to hit exact
   numbers required by status effect cards. I’m convinced there’s still
   another layer of RNG beneath the hood that makes for the most
   entertaining fights—I mean, the Loud Bird I encountered at level 5
   rolled one double, an even and two dice under 5 every round when I
   fought him—but with the information you have, there are always
   opportunities to pull off something that feels clever.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

     At some point you’re certain to pause and wonder how you ended up
     putting such brainpower into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   At the end of each dungeon run is a boss and a new unlockable
   character. Bosses offer surprisingly little challenge though, and are
   sometimes outmatched by one or two of the enemies you had to best on
   the way to them. It's unusually lenient from the developer who made
   surviving for ten seconds in Super Hexagon feel like a
   once-in-a-lifetime feat of skill. Nevertheless, with the boss roasted
   and a new character for the taking, it’s back to the dungeons for a
   series of ever-escalating challenges.

   There’s a deceptively massive chunk of game here, and if the likes of
   Hearthstone or Gwent never clicked with you it’s an easy way to slide
   into the world of agonising over deck builds. You only have space for a
   handful of cards, but striking the right balance between attack,
   defense, and modifiers is just as engrossing. At some point you’re
   certain to pause and wonder how you ended up putting such brainpower
   into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

   Like an over-eager Tinder date, the vibe is very much casual and
   lighthearted at first, but before too long you’re made aware that the
   expectation is absolutely that of a long-term prospect. Unlike a
   stranger you swiped on the internet though, Dicey Dungeons doesn’t keep
   liking your Instagram posts months after you stop playing it.

   And, to jettison that analogy entirely before it’s stretched well
   beyond its limit, it does a surprisingly good job of world-building.
   When you fight a Baby Squid, its attacks involve squirting ink which
   blinds you to some of your dice. Hedgehogs use a lot of spikes. The
   aforementioned Loud Bird uses sound to its advantage. This is all via
   the medium of dice rolls, you understand, but it’s easy to be pulled
   into the surreal ‘90s cartoon-like world just the same.

   Longer term play is limited by the absence of multiplayer, but as a
   slice of solo deck-building Dicey Dungeons is engrossing, not to
   mention buoyed by great art and presentation. I do feel that faint itch
   to just load up Gwent and tend to my decks there instead when I play,
   but Gwent doesn’t look anywhere near as much like Ren & Stimpy as this.

Our Verdict

   An atmospheric, brilliantly written and acted detective thriller that
   tells a compelling story in a unique way.

Need to know

   What is it? An investigative thriller set on a computer desktop.
   Developer Furious Bee, Sam Barlow
   Publisher Annapurna Interactive
   Reviewed on GTX 1080, Intel i5-6600K, 16GB RAM
   Buy it Steam

   Telling Lies is a series of one-sided conversations. You play as a
   woman whose motives are initially unclear, who has been given access to
   an archive of secretly recorded video calls taken from the laptops and
   mobile phones of four very different people. When the game begins you
   know nothing about them. These troubled souls are complete strangers to
   you, their lives a mystery.

   But by the end you'll know them intimately, and will have uncovered a
   series of shocking truths about their lives. Well, in theory. Because
   some of these people are, as the title suggests, liars. Separating fact
   from fiction is at the heart of this new 'desktop adventure' from the
   creator of narrative experiment Her Story. Like that game, your
   interpretation of the plot is determined by which clips you discover
   and the order you view them in.

   As you search the database you'll see clips of a father reading his
   daughter a bedtime story, a couple watching a movie together, and other
   snippets of people just living their lives. But then you'll hear
   something that piques your curiosity. A reference to a mysterious
   incident, a name, or a place. And you'll search for these things in the
   database, unravelling yet more intriguing threads, slowly revealing an
   intricate, labyrinthine story that takes place across two years. The
   game's blend of the blandly domestic and the thrilling is an effective
   one, setting the everyday lives of the characters against a bubbling
   plot of conspiracy and duplicity.

     Something a character has said about themselves could be (and often
     is) a lie

   I'm being vague here, but that's because even telling you the
   characters' names would spoil the experience. Discovering these things
   yourself by paying close attention to the dialogue, and sometimes the
   environment, is part of what makes Telling Lies such a rewarding
   detective game. Especially when you realise that something a character
   has said about themselves could be (and often is) a lie, encouraging
   you to find more clips buried in the database to reveal the truth.
   Starting the game with literally nothing, and ending it with a complex
   story mapped out in your head, is an immensely satisfying experience.

   It almost felt like a personal betrayal when I learned something about
   a character that contradicted everything I thought I knew about them,
   which reflects the experience of some of the characters in the story.
   Telling Lies is incredibly absorbing, especially if you play at night,
   in a dimly lit room, with headphones on. The moody, almost neo-noir
   atmosphere, and a gorgeous, cinematic score—composed by Nainita Desai,
   performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra—makes it a game you can
   really lose yourself in.

   Telling Lies is a lot of things at once, skipping between moods,
   themes, and genres. One minute it's a family drama, the next it's a
   tense crime thriller. And it's all brilliantly acted, with a cast of
   established film and TV actors providing some impressively
   natural-sounding dialogue. Logan Marshall-Green was the highlight for
   me, playing his duplicitous, conflicted character with real depth. But
   the whole cast is great, and the production values are excellent
   throughout—which is just as well, because 99% of the game is watching
   videos.

   (Image credit: Future)

     You aren't just watching a story play out in Telling Lies: you're
     constructing one

   That doesn't mean this is a passive experience, though. Far from it.
   You aren't just watching a story play out in Telling Lies: you're
   constructing one. A seemingly throwaway word in a conversation—the name
   of a city, perhaps, or even something more subtle than that—can be
   massively important, opening up a whole new winding subplot that
   totally transforms your understanding of the story. This means you have
   to be constantly engaged with the characters and what they're saying,
   and if you're anything like me, taking pages of notes.

   The game takes place entirely within the desktop of a PC. There are
   some clues scattered around here—documents, images, notes—that give you
   an idea of who you are and what you're looking for. You can drag
   windows around, write things down in a notes app, and even play a spot
   of solitaire if your brain needs a rest. The whirr of the PC's fans,
   the churn of the hard drive as you access video files, and the moving
   reflection of your face in the smudgy sheen of the monitor makes
   interacting with the computer feel wonderfully tactile.

   Occasionally, and I could never figure out if this was random or
   triggered by something specific, the reflection in the monitor will
   become clearer and you'll see something happening in the woman's
   apartment. One of these moments in particular is very clever, and made
   me jump because I was so engrossed in the story. But again, it's best
   if you discover it yourself. There are a lot of nice, mischievous
   little details in Telling Lies, like how your vision blurs if you stare
   at the screen for too long without moving the cursor—simulating the
   fact that you're supposed to be looking through these video clips in
   the wee hours.

   (Image credit: Future)

     You can bookmark important clips and view a log of all your searches

   It's also something of a stroke of genius to only show you one side of
   each conversation, leaving you to fill in the blanks or do some
   database hunting to find the other half. Wondering what the person is
   reacting to, or what the other person is saying, gives the game an
   extra layer of mystery. This also means that, in a lot of the videos,
   you'll just be watching the subject sitting in silence, listening to
   the unheard person on the other end of the call. But thankfully you can
   scrub through any clip you find, rewinding, pausing, and
   fast-forwarding at your leisure. You can also bookmark important clips
   and view a log of all your searches.

   One thing I miss from Her Story, however, is the database tracker. This
   lets you know how many clips you've found, and how many remain
   undiscovered, and I found it a useful way to get an idea of how
   complete a picture I had of the story. Telling Lies is much more opaque
   in comparison, by design, but the completionist in me was left with the
   feeling that I hadn't seen everything. A report at the end of the game
   gives you a vague idea of how many you found (in my first playthrough
   it said 'just under half'), but I'd have liked a more explicit
   visualisation of how much of the narrative I had left to uncover. This
   hardly dampened my enjoyment of the game, but it's one thing I wish had
   made it over from Her Story.

   Because the conversations you're watching and listening to are so
   private, I experienced a really powerful connection to the characters
   in Telling Lies—almost feeling like I knew them by the end. But this
   also made me feel like a creepy voyeur, seeing things I had no right
   to. There's something uneasy about listening to a couple talking
   intimately about their relationship, or watching a little girl in bed
   listening to her dad tell her a story. But I get the feeling that's
   what I was supposed to feel like, and if that was the case, well, it
   worked. However, my desire to know more about the characters and story
   always took precedent, and the deeper I got tangled up in their lives,
   the more I fell in love with them, and the game.

   (Image credit: Future)

   If you played Her Story, Telling Lies will be instantly familiar. It
   even has the same limit of only showing you five clips from any given
   search term, the explanation for which is a little more tortured this
   time around. Essentially this is Her Story with a bigger budget, a much
   more sprawling story, and a surprisingly huge cast. Outside of the four
   main characters there are dozens of minor and background characters,
   and a few supporting characters who are just as fascinating as the
   stars of the show. So, in many ways, Telling Lies feels more like a
   refinement of what was established in Her Story, rather than a bold new
   experiment in storytelling.

   But that's fine, because the core concept—an open-ended story that's
   revealed in a different way to every person who plays the game—is still
   enormously compelling, and only possible in this medium. You might find
   a clip in your first ten minutes that I found three hours in, and it's
   fascinating to think about how that would completely skew your
   perception of the story. But even with all this randomness, it's
   amazing how the game almost feels like it was paced and structured by
   hand. Her Story pulled the same trick, but the greater variety of
   stories here only heightens that sense of mystery, discovery, shock,
   and revelation.

   At its best when the screen is full of enemies, Amid Evil is a badass
   monster mash.

Need to know

   What is it? An FPS inspired by Raven Software classics Hexen and

   Amid Evil's worst weapon is a staff that shoots blue homing
   blobs—pathetic water balloons that splash against low-poly demons, many
   of whom look like what you'd get if you coated a bunch of triangles
   with super glue and threw them in a dryer. It's worth using during the
   most annoying encounters, when a projectile-lobbing enemy is perched
   high above and is hard to hit with anything else. I don't like it or
   the moments when I resort to it, but I can also use the entire earth as
   a grenade, which more than evens things out. Amid Evil is good.

   It's a throwback FPS like Dusk, but rather than hitscan pistol
   headshots, Amid Evil recalls Heretic and Hexen's magical weapons. The
   staff sucks, but there's also a magic sword, a grenade launcher that
   shrinks and fires random planets (like the earth), a spike-firing
   morningstar, a lightning trident, plus your default axe and a
   geometrically-unreasonable purple thing that clears rooms like Doom's
   BFG.

   Most of the weapons are fun, but the Star of Torment, which pins
   enemies to walls like FEAR's stake gun, or can be used to homer them
   out of the level entirely like they've been slapped by a god, is Amid
   Evil's pièce de résistance—I can never tire of it.

Pushing buttons

   Part of Amid Evil's appeal is that it ignores certain annoying,
   speed-hindering FPS conventions scaffolded onto shooters since the
   '90s. There's no fall damage. You can breathe underwater. Elevators
   won't crush you if they catch your shoulder on the way down. They'll
   just clip through you as they should. Accidental deaths have their
   place in games, especially when they're comedic, but here they'd only
   get in the way of the fun and the speed. They aren't missed.

     I love that there's no fall damage, but sometimes it's a curse.

   Amid Evil falls prey to other genre foibles, though. Getting out of
   water is a pain in the ass, because you have to convince the game that
   you're a dolphin and deserve to majestically leap over the lip of the
   pool when what it really wants is for you to ineffectually bob
   side-to-side.

   And then there's the platforming, and you probably already know the
   type: Here's a game about running very fast all the time because
   there's a mob of demons chasing you, so how about you climb spiraling,
   ultra-narrow balance beams and leap between platforms that disappear on
   a timer?

   If you thrive on precarious ledges, you should definitely play Amid
   Evil—it'll make for impressive speed runs—but I took to quicksaving
   constantly so that if I tripped up and stumbled down three-quarters of
   a level I could reload and try again without having to climb all the
   way back up. I love that there's no fall damage, but sometimes it's a
   curse.

   Also slowing things down are the gods' button-centric architectural
   designs. You're the latest mortal champion taking a stab at cleaning up
   their evil-infested lands, and except for the boss stages, every level
   is a button hunt. Body-check one of the big blue switches, and
   something about the level changes: an elevator activates, a door opens,
   the water level rises. And then you go find the next button to walk
   face-first into until you eventually find a key to open up the next big
   area, just like in the classics.

   That's not really why I liked the classics. I love Amid Evil's big open
   levels—the way some of them fit together, especially the one made of
   moving gears, boggles me—and they're full of secret areas to discover.
   But kicking around demon guts as I retrace my steps to try to figure
   out which damn pathway the last button opened up isn't as fun as
   pinning demons to walls with the Star of Torment, which is very fun.

Soul sacrifice

   Most of my 'buts' about Amid Evil go in the other direction. Some of
   the levels are tedious, sure, but I always wanted to see what strange
   machines and inadvisable architecture lay around the next corner.
   Anti-aliasing is off by default (I turned it on for these screenshots),
   and I might prefer it that way—the glittering jaggies give Amid Evil
   the look of a rare foil baseball card, and it's more endearing than
   garish. It's beautiful all smoothed out, too. The opening scene,
   overlooking a church at the bottom of a cavern, drew me in like a
   siren.

   And some of the enemies are boring, but one time I fought two giant
   space serpents while suspended in a glob of water floating in the
   astral plane. Some of the demon spawn are just green triangles that
   rush at you, but in one part there are giant laser monsters that come
   across like Angels from Neon Genesis Evangelion.

   When I'm just tearing through evil knights and stone giants and weird
   heads with flamethrower mouths, and I'm more kite than man, Amid Evil
   shines like the best of Quake and Serious Sam. My second-favorite
   weapon, the sword Whisper's Edge, slings waves of green energy that can
   clip multiple enemies. I could spend all day circle strafing around
   courtyards, slicing the heads off of the chain of grunts following me
   and flinging the occasional wave at the flying artillery above.

     I kind of wanted to go kill the gods I was doing all this dirty work
     for afterward. How were they gonna stop me?

   My favorite thing about Amid Evil is that while its Hard Mode is
   challenging, just about every bad situation is salvageable—it feels
   nearly ideal to me, as difficulty modes go. I've mentioned quicksaving,
   which is one useful tool, and secret areas with big heath boosts are
   also helpful. There's also the part where you can go super saiyan.

   Slain enemies drop souls, and if you fill a meter with them, you can
   activate Soul Mode, which turns all of your weapons into fire hoses of
   death. The Star of Torment fires clumps of homing crystals that one-hit
   just about anything and explode outward on contact to clean up nearby
   grunts. Whisper's Edge fires bigger waves that always pierce enemies
   and bounce off walls. The BFG-like Aeturnum, which often saved my ass
   in normal mode when I needed to vaporize a room without a real fight,
   fires black holes.

   Soul Mode is not nerfed at all against bosses. I took the first of them
   down with a soul'd up Star of Torment like he was nothing. Though the
   final boss was tougher, it only took me a couple tries, and the first
   was just to figure out the concept. Would I have felt more satisfaction
   had it been harder? I don't know, but I didn't feel unsatisfied. I kind
   of wanted to go kill the gods I was doing all this dirty work for
   afterward. How were they gonna stop me?

   (Image credit: New Blood)

   My only complaint is that I didn't need Soul Mode enough. I'd hold onto
   a full meter for ages, thinking I'd surely encounter an untenable
   situation where I'd release it and mop up Hell's minions like a spill
   on aisle 666. But in some levels I never even thought about using it,
   and when I did I'd obliterate what was in front of me so quickly that
   I'd desperately sprint around looking for more stone giants or creepers
   or flame spirits to devour and find none. That's helped a little by
   playing the hardest difficulty, Evil Mode. It's semi-hidden, but I'm
   sure the brave will find it.

   There are quiet moments in Amid Evil, too, and not just when I get lost
   looking for a button. As I took a breather from the carnage in one of
   the final levels, a faint, bumbling trumpet unexpectedly cut through
   the ominous vocal 'ahhs' and synthy moans, as if one of the orchestra
   members was bleeding out in the astral plane somewhere outside the
   level. I was moved by a game about slaughtering low-poly demons, it's
   true.

   The pithy signs around the levels aren't especially original as far as
   godly decrees go (and are hard to read because the font for everything
   in Amid Evil is awful), but they do evoke a curious universe that could
   live in the pages of old fantasy quarterlies. Despite barely telling a
   story, Amid Evil made me wonder if the gods might be the real
   assholes—they were the ones who put buttons everywhere, after all—and
   when it was over I lingered for a long time before letting it end. I
   want more.

Our Verdict

   A triumphant remake of Yakuza 2, full of fun diversions and featuring
   one of the series' best stories.

Need to know

   What is it? A remake of Yakuza 2, a game about punching a lot of
   people.
   Reviewed on:  GeForce GTX 1070, 16GB RAM, i5-6600k
   Price: $30/£25
   Release date: May 9
   Publisher: Sega
   Developer: In-house
   Multiplayer: Two players, local, in Virtua Fighter 2.
   Link: Official site

   Welcome back to Kamurocho. Things are different here now. The Tojo Clan
   is in disarray after the events of Yakuza Kiwami, Virtua Fighter 2 has
   been installed in the Sega Arcade, and Majima has started a
   construction company—tearing down the homeless camp of West Park in
   preparation for the Kamurocho Hills office complex. But more dramatic
   than any of these small developments is Yakuza Kiwami 2's big change:
   the series' new Dragon engine, and the many improvements and changes it
   brings.

   Yakuza is an economical series that rarely reinvents the wheel. It
   often reuses assets and animations, because the focus is always on the
   same handful of districts, and the small ways they change over the
   course of decades. Kiwami 2 is still a Yakuza game, which means it's a
   crime drama interspersed by fights, exploration, minigames and
   substories full of ridiculous slice-of-life character moments that help
   humanise protagonist Kiryu—making him more than the hardboiled
   stereotype he could so easily have been. It's also a remake of 2006's
   Yakuza 2, which, despite looking significantly better, features mostly
   shot-for-shot recreations of its cutscenes.

   Still, the changes Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio bring to the Dragon engine
   offer a significant shift in style and systems. You can now seamlessly
   enter buildings, for instance, and brawls that start on the street can
   even spill into shops. It makes the city feel more cohesive and
   connected, and the game as a whole feels more modern—up to a point. I
   slightly prefer Yakuza 0's combat, which felt crisper and more arcadey
   in a way that made fights more enjoyable. But overall, the enhancements
   are a success.

   It looks nicer, too. Kiwami 2 takes place in both Kamurocho and
   Sotenbori, the two locations from Yakuza 0, and in both the streets
   feel wider and more detailed. Just standing in them, Kiryu feels
   smaller, which helps better convey the scale of the city. Once again,
   Sotenbori—based on Osaka's Dotonbori—is the standout. Its main street
   is a beautiful explosion of billboards, flags, lanterns and mechanised
   signs. Kiwami 2 does a particularly good job of highlighting the
   differences between its two locations. Everything about them has a
   different flavour, from the type of substories that Kiryu encounters to
   the music that plays during a fight.

East vs West

   Those differences help contextualise the story. When hitmen from
   Osaka's Omi Alliance assassinate the Tojo Clan's fifth chairman, Kiryu
   is dragged back into Japan's underworld on a mission to stop the two
   cities' main gangs from descending into open war. In his way is Ryuji
   Goda, the Dragon of Kansai. In Ryuji's mind the world isn't wide enough
   for both Kiryu, the Dragon of Dojima, and him. From their first
   meeting, it's clear the two are on a collision course, and that
   inevitability adds great tension to the events as they unfold.

   Kiwami 2 is also about the relationship between Kiryu and detective
   Kaoru Sayama, who places Kiryu under protective custody in an effort to
   prevent his showdown with Ryuji. Despite the differences between
   them—and Sayama's hatred of yakuza generally and the Tojo Clan
   specifically—the two grow closer over the course of the game. Outside
   of the main story, Kiryu has an almost childlike naivety about sex and
   romance. But his growing relationship with Sayama adds depth to the
   character, and is heartwarming to see.

   While the story isn't quite as tight as Yakuza 0—suffering from the
   occasional tangent, lull and contrived twist —it's still one of the
   strongest of the series. And elsewhere, Kiwami 2 is packed full of
   interesting diversions. There's a return of Yakuza 0's cabaret club
   storyline, which picks up some of the same story threads. There's a
   strange RTS minigame featuring Majima's construction company that is
   admittedly more functional than enjoyable, but offers lots of fun
   character moments. There's bouncer missions, gambling, the colosseum,
   street bosses, golf, men in diapers, and loads more. There's even a
   couple of minigames about pissing.

   Where Yakuza Kiwami felt like an expansion to Yakuza 0, Kiwami 2 is
   larger, fuller and more varied than Yakuza 6, its Dragon engine
   predecessor (which isn't available on PC—the series seemingly being
   ported in order of storyline). While I still slightly prefer Yakuza 0,
   this is well worth your time.

Mordhau review

Hacking and slashing in this highly skill-dependent medieval melee game.

Our Verdict

   High skill cap melee combat is equally rewarding and daunting, though
   the archery and support roles could use some work.

NEED TO KNOW

   What is it? A complex, twitch-based multiplayer melee combat game.

   1070
   Price $30/£23.79
   Release date Out now
   Developer Triternion
   Publisher In-house
   Multiplayer: Up to 64 Online
   Link: Official site

   Most games that hand you a sword and point you in the direction of a
   battalion of foes feel empowering and heroic. After a few rounds of
   Mordhau, the prospect of heading once more into the breach seemed more
   terrifying than anything else. Of all the multiplayer melee games I’ve
   played over the years, this one has decidedly the highest skill cap and
   the least patience for those who haven’t taken the time to learn its
   complex, twitch-based combat. The upside to that is when you do go on a
   hot streak, you feel like way more of a badass than any of those more
   forgiving games can ever let you feel.

   The basic premise is pretty simple. In the default Frontline mode, you
   take up arms as a rugged warrior from one of nine classes (or you can
   design your own) and rush into the fray in up to 32-v-32,
   objective-based skirmishes on attractive, realistically-structured
   medieval battlefields. Then, you probably die pretty quickly to someone
   a bit quicker or more experienced than you and respawn, hopefully
   having learned something to take forward into your next brawl.

   Each clash of swords can look deceptively simple, but is actually
   highly complex in the huge variety of attacks, parries, and counters
   available to you. A well-scripted and straightforward tutorial will run
   you through the fundamentals, but it’s another matter entirely to
   execute the correct moves at the right time. It takes many hours just
   to start feeling competent, but the satisfaction of growing confidence
   as your execution improves is something no numerical progression system
   can really replicate. It reminded me a lot of Sekiro, in that I started
   out as an absolute scrub and eventually started to think of myself as a
   badass swordsman. I mean, at least sometimes.

Swift as a coursing river

   Everything you do in melee is highly dependent on split-second timing,
   so sloppy or indecisive swordplay will be punished heavily by
   experienced players. You can’t hold down block while brandishing a
   sword, for instance. Left-click executes a timed parry that only works
   for about a second, so you need to sync it up with your opponent’s
   movements. And almost any defensive measure you deploy has an
   equivalent counter that will slap it aside with ease, so most duels
   will favor whichever player can read their opponent and react quickly
   and aggressively.

   It is a bit of a bummer that there’s not a lot you can do when you’re
   just learning the ropes and want to take a more relaxed, support role.
   There is an engineer class who can shake things up by deploying siege
   weapons and the like, but I often found my contributions in this area
   were relatively small and easily undone by the other classes. In other
   multiplayer games like Battlefield 5 and Overwatch, I can focus on
   reviving teammates or locking down a point if I want a little bit of a
   break from high-intensity combat, and Mordhau doesn’t support that
   playstyle especially well.

   Even with its early success, I worry that this will shrink the number
   of players who can really get into Mordhau. If I want to invite my
   younger cousin who isn’t up to Murderlord level in melee action games
   into a match, there would be comparatively less for him to do that
   might make him feel useful. Even the most hardened swordsman has to
   admit that giving less twitch skilled players something meaningful to
   do only helps fill the servers and give us more fresh meat to beat up
   on. That doesn’t work if they all get frustrated and leave.

   Archery, too, I found a bit disappointing. Mordhau has gone the route
   of making arrows very powerful, but very difficult to land a hit with.
   Drawing back the bow requires about a second in which your crosshair
   moves in a semicircle, making it almost impossible to aim, then gives
   you a couple seconds of a steady hand before you start to wobble and
   lose your aim. The projectiles themselves are fairly slow and
   experience significant drop-off after leaving the string. This comes
   across as very realistic, but not especially fun, and it makes becoming
   an even somewhat effective archer even more difficult than getting the
   hang of melee.

   The root of the problem is trying to simulate realistic archery in what
   are, ultimately, pretty unrealistic conditions. You didn’t see a lot of
   medieval battles with a couple dozen guys in armor darting around in
   loose formation, changing direction on a dime, jumping over logs and
   intermingling with each other’s troops. It’s chaos, usually leaving
   archers vulnerable on the sidelines to skirmish and try to take
   1000-to-1 shots of opportunity at individual targets. In reality, these
   types of troops would only have been deployed en masse to fire at
   stationary formations. The one place it does work kind of decently is
   on maps with walls or a palisade where archers can take shots at
   advancing enemies from a position of safety. But on bigger, open
   battlefields, what’s the point?

   Mordhau also features two other gameplay modes: an at this point almost
   ubiquitous Battle Royale and a player vs AI Horde mode. I didn’t like
   either of them as much as the default Frontline, but Horde can be a fun
   way to learn the ropes with the help of some more skilled players
   without having to worry too much about being skewered by those same
   veterans.

   In Horde, you start with no equipment and have to kill waves of AI
   attackers to get money to buy better stuff. The baddies will keep pace
   with you, however, gaining better equipment and coming in greater
   numbers from one wave to the next. Their combat ability is
   significantly inferior to a skilled player's, but they have a tendency
   to mob up on any solo fighters they can single out. It becomes
   important to stick together and use formations and natural choke points
   to survive. Overall, it’s not as much a test of the things Mordhau does
   best as the PvP modes, but it’s still a fair bit of fun.

   Battle Royale is my least preferred of Mordhau’s modes. Like Horde, you
   start with no equipment and have to scramble for randomized loot from
   chests scattered across the map. It’s a familiar song and dance from
   there, as the playable area will slowly shrink to force confrontations
   and the last one standing wins. Having played other Battle Royales, I
   didn’t find anything spectacular about it that would convince me to
   come back when there are so many existing options for battle royale and
   Mordhau’s other modes are more entertaining.

   It's also not the best fit for newer players. If you haven’t really
   mastered the melee systems yet, you’re likely to die quickly and then
   sit around for several minutes while the match finishes or requeue and
   wait for a new round, which may take a while itself depending on how
   the servers are behaving. Either way, you don’t get thrown back into
   the action as quickly like in Frontline, which means fewer chances to
   learn from your mistakes and test out new tactics. I’d therefore
   recommend avoiding it until you’re already finishing in the top half in
   Frontline matches.

Class conscious

More on Mordhau

   Take your Mordhau mercenary skills to the next level with our builds
   guide and tier list. Or, if you really want to be a jerk, learn how to
   play Mordhau like a right bastard. You can also read our general tips
   if you need some help staying alive during the melee.

   Mordhau’s kit design and progression system is very in-depth and
   interesting, aside from the odd fact that you get the choice between
   several skin colors that are all just different shades of white. This
   isn’t supported by history to begin with, but Mordhau also doesn’t seem
   to be trying to simulate any real-life historical factions or events,
   which makes it especially weird.

   There are a lot of meaningful equipment options, which let you be
   anything from a lightly-armored berserker with a big, eff off axe to a
   tanky knight of the realm with full plate and a deadly mace. New visual
   and mechanical options unlock as you level up your profile from one
   match to the next, so there’s always something shiny and new to look
   forward to.

   My biggest complaint is online stability. The matchmaking sometimes
   doesn’t even work at all (though I had very few problems joining
   matches from the server browser), and there were times when I spent
   over two hours in a queue without successfully getting into a match.
   That experience wasn’t super common, but random lag spikes and even
   getting booted from a game due to connection issues were. Performance
   was also very inconsistent on some maps even with a GTX 1070. The devs
   are aware of these issues and it has seemingly been getting better over
   the last couple weeks, thankfully. But I still haven’t successfully
   queued for Frontline through the matchmaking even once, so you’ll want
   to use the server browser for that mode.

   If you’ve got the patience and dexterity to take full advantage of its
   melee combat, Mordhau can be a real treat. Especially in the Frontline
   mode, slashing and stabbing across its beautiful and well-designed maps
   was really entertaining once I got my feet under me. The high skill cap
   and lack of good supporting roles can make it feel tiring at times, but
   it’s mostly worth it for the satisfaction that comes with increasing
   mastery.

Mordhau

   High skill cap melee combat is equally rewarding and daunting, though
   the archery and support roles could use some work.

Our Verdict

   Heaven's Vault communicates the beauty of assigning meaning to symbols,
   and thus the people who wrote them.

NEED TO KNOW

   What is it? An archaeological code-breaking mystery.

   Heaven's Vault is exquisite. I've finished my first playthrough of the
   archaeological sci-fi adventure, so the main narrative mysteries like
   "What happened to roboticist Janniqi Renba?" and "What exactly is
   Heaven's Vault?" are known. The reason I immediately headed into New
   Game Plus is that the real puzzle at the heart of Heaven's Vault is
   translating the world's Ancient hieroglyphics. That's still unfolding
   and it's absolutely stunning.

   As archaeologist Aliya Elasra I've sailed the cosmic rivers of the
   Nebula in my wooden spaceboat. I've docked at distant moons, pottered
   around farms and markets, and chatted with a varied cast of characters,
   including many little exchanges with my companion robot, Six. (Don't
   ask what happened to One through Five). The story mysteries provide a
   structure to guide your explorations but for me they were always
   secondary to the joy of collecting new text fragments and teasing out
   new meanings.

   Finding text fragments happens in a number of ways. There are artefacts
   with carved inscriptions—weapons, oil burners, lintels, sculptures…
   There are fragments of books. There is graffiti. There are murals. Some
   are obvious thanks to the UI immediately marking them out on the screen
   as areas to interact with. Others only appear if you explore the nooks
   and crannies of an area.

   When you find one you'll see it laid out on the screen as a string of
   symbols. The raw form is scripta continua—there are no spaces to
   separate words—so part of the puzzle is actually affixing meaning to
   particular groups of symbols and part of it is figuring out how to
   apply those symbols.

   To give you an example in English, say you had a string of text with no
   spaces which included the letters: "... T O G E T H E R…" Part of
   decoding the meaning is figuring out if those should be read as
   "together" or "to get her".

   At first context clues will be your main guide. If Aliya describes an
   artifact as also featuring the sign of the Empire, the word Emperor or
   Empress might appear. If the object has an obvious function, like a
   place of worship or a weapon, that might help too. You might also just
   look at the options the game provides and try to make the most
   natural-sounding sentence out of those.

   If your translation makes sense in multiple contexts Aliya will change
   it from a speculative meaning to a definite translation in her
   dictionary. These come in really handy because when you're dealing with
   unfamiliar words the game will show you words with similar symbols from
   your dictionary which might be related.

   One of the many things I love about this system is that it works on two
   levels. On one, you can pick your way through the game's language using
   approaches like context clues, educated guesses, and by matching the
   shapes of words you already know to new fragments until the game tells
   you you've worked out where the breaks between words are.

   For the hardcore grammar/linguistics/logic nerds (HOLLER!) you can grab
   your notebook and deduce more nuanced systems. At one point I took a
   break from visiting locations to pick through my dictionary and
   established that there are markers denoting the past-tense, signaling
   adjectives and verbs, and indicating that two concepts are tied to one
   another. My most insufferably smug moment was being able to translate
   fragments which Heaven's Vault wouldn't let Aliya decipher in-game
   yet.

   New Game Plus allowed me to start again but keep my existing
   dictionary. To keep up with my expanded knowledge the fragments are
   longer and more involved this time which is exciting! I'm also playing
   as more of a jerk so my interactions and choices are a little
   different.

   Heaven's Vault is not perfect. Sometimes info added to the in-game
   historical timeline is a little out of sync with what the character has
   learned from the conversation. The river is clunky to navigate and
   sometimes tells you you've gone the wrong way despite following Six's
   directions. Character reactions don't always make emotional sense. The
   camera settles in odd places. Aliya's knowledge of Ancient feels too
   small at the start. Walking around the moon of Elboreth is annoying.
   Oh, and sometimes trawling for artefacts feels very pixel-hunty. For me
   none of these are more than minor irritants, but I know others found
   them more abrasive.

   There's also the animation system. I really like it but I know that's
   not universal. If you stand still and then start walking again you'll
   see a ghostly image of Aliya in the spot where you paused for a second
   or two before it fades. To me that's a nod to the game's archaeology
   theme. Aliya's presence leaves imprints in the world, perhaps footprint
   or scent. They fade fast, but they're on the same spectrum as the
   artefacts.

   Heaven's Vault does a beautiful job of letting you unlock a language,
   and thus a dialogue of sorts, with the past, via a wonderfully engaging
   protagonist.
