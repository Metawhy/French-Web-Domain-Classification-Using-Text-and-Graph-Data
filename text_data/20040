   Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is proud to announce the birth of
   two Snow Leopard cubs on May 22.

   When they were one month old, the male and female cubs weighed just
   over five pounds. The cubs’ parents are Rosemary and Pasha. Rosemary is
   5-years-old, weighs approximately 78 pounds, and has lived at the Zoo
   since 2015. Pasha is 10-years-old, weighs approximately 106 pounds, and
   arrived at the Zoo in 2012.

   Dad can currently be seen by guests in the Asian Highlands exhibit.
   This pair also had a cub named Victoria in 2017. Victoria recently went
   to live at the Binder Park Zoo near Battle Creek, Michigan.

   Snow Leopards are listed as “Vulnerable” by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature’s Red List. There are only an estimated 2,700 -
   3,300 Snow Leopards left in the world. The main threats facing them
   include loss of habitat, retaliatory killing from predation on
   livestock, and illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts.

   Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is a dedicated member of the Snow
   Leopard Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program that works to maintain a
   genetically stable assurance population of Snow Leopards in zoos.
   Research conducted by the Zoo’s nutrition and reproductive physiology
   departments has provided valuable information to the Snow Leopard SSP
   that is helping to improve the care and management of these amazing
   cats around the world.

   In addition to efforts taking place on Zoo grounds, Omaha’s Zoo and
   Aquarium supports the Snow Leopard Trust, an organization working out
   in the field within Snow Leopard habitat. Snow Leopard Trust focuses
   primarily on community education directed toward improving the
   relationships between herders and big cats by creating incentives for
   the community to protect Snow Leopards and their ecosystem. To learn
   more about Snow Leopard Trust’s mission, visit: www.snowleopard.org

Germany's First Giant Panda Cubs Born at Zoo Berlin

September 22, 2019

   Erstversorgung Panda-Zwillinge_Zoo Berlin_2019

   Behind the scenes in the Panda Garden at Zoo Berlin, first-time Giant
   Panda mom Meng Meng snuggles her tiny newborns into the warm, soft fur
   of her face. On August 31, Berlin’s Panda population doubled as Germany
   welcomed its first-ever Panda offspring – two of them!

   The past month at Zoo Berlin has been particularly tense and exciting,
   with plenty of waiting and crossed fingers. Finally, on August 31 at
   6:54 p.m., the moment everyone had been waiting for arrived: following
   a gestation period of 147 days, female Panda Meng Meng, 6, gave birth
   to her very first cub. The joyous event came just one week after
   experts from Zoo Berlin and the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife
   Research (IZW) were able to perform an ultrasound scan that determined
   Meng Meng was indeed pregnant.

   Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew just what to do:
   she placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it
   lovingly with her big paws, warm breath, and the soft fur of her
   cheeks. But mother and child weren’t alone for long, as at 7:42 p.m. –
   just under an hour later – a second cub was born!

   “Meng Meng and her two cubs coped well with the birth and are all in
   good health,” reports Zoo Director Dr. Andreas Knieriem. “Even though
   these are the first offspring born to our young female Panda, she is
   already doing a wonderful job as a mum. In the beginning, the young
   have to feed roughly every two to three hours and are dependent on the
   body heat of their mother to keep warm.”

   Like all baby Giant Pandas, Germany’s first Panda cubs were born pink
   with fine white down and a disproportionately large tail. Though they
   are helpless, the youngsters came out with strong lungs and immediately
   put them to good use. Meng Meng responds to their loud squeaks by
   carefully guiding the little ones to her teats to feed. As Pandas that
   give birth to twins usually only raise one of the cubs, in close
   cooperation with Chinese experts of the Chengdu Research Base of Giant
   Panda Breeding Zoo Berlin has decided to actively support Meng Meng in
   the rearing process to ensure the survival of both cubs.

   “There are only 1,864 adult Giant Pandas currently living in their
   natural habitat,” says Knieriem. “As a result, every single new cub
   represents an important contribution to the conservation of the
   species.” The young Pandas are therefore currently on alternating,
   two-to-three-hour shifts with their mother, and are otherwise being
   cared for in a cozy warm incubator by the Chinese breeding experts.
   Vets have even managed to conduct an initial examination – with
   promising results. At two weeks old, the cubs had more than doubled
   their birth weights to 431 grams (about one pound) and 343 grams
   (roughly 12 ounces). They are nursing so well from Meng Meng that
   supplemental bottle feedings are no longer needed. The cubs’ genders
   have not been determined yet.

   The young Panda family will stay behind the scenes for a while and will
   not be on view to Zoo visitors until further notice. For Panda dad Jiao
   Qing, 9, on the other hand, life goes on as normal. Male Pandas are not
   involved in the rearing of their young, so he can be found relaxing and
   munching on bamboo in the Panda Garden.

   See more photos of Meng Meng and her babies below.

Little Geckos Will Become 'Giants'

September 21, 2019

   DSC_9382

   Two baby Madagascar Giant Day Geckos (Phelsuma grandis) hatched last
   month from eggs laid by adults currently living in the rainforest
   habitat at the Tennessee Aquarium.

   In spite of their name, the babies are only a few inches long right
   now. The Aquarium's experts are caring for these tiny reptiles behind
   the scenes in a special Gecko nursery.

   The Aquarium’s herpetology team says the pair are currently growing
   well and “eating like champs.”

   The Madagascar Giant Day Gecko has a bright green body with brilliant
   red markings. The red markings fade as the Gecko ages, so the adults
   are mostly green in color. In the wild, these Geckos feed on insects,
   small reptiles, nectar and pollen. Adults can grow to around 12 inches
   in length.

   Geckos are a type of Lizard. Madagascar Giant Day Geckos are native to
   the tropical forests of northern Madagascar, and a few other locations
   to which they have been introduced by humans.

   Madagascar Giant Day Geckos are rumored to be the inspiration for the
   Geico Gecko of advertising fame.

Delightful Duo of Red Panda Cubs for Chester Zoo

September 20, 2019

   1_Adorable red panda twins born at Chester Zoo have first health check
   up (11)

   Chester Zoo’s two Red Panda cubs have been revealed as a boy and a
   girl, during their first ever health check-up.

   The precious twelve-week-old twins, classed by conservationists as
   endangered in the wild, were born on June 22 to mum, Nima, and dad,
   Koda, who have kept them tucked up in their nest boxes since birth.

   Now, specialist vets and keepers have had their very first look at the
   delightful duo, examining the pair during the health check, where they
   were weighed, sexed and vaccinated. Each of the fluffy youngsters was
   given a full, clean bill of health.

   James Andrewes, Assistant Team Manager at the zoo, said, “These Red
   Panda twins are wonderful, important new additions to the carefully
   managed breeding programme for the species, which is working to
   increase the safety-net population in Europe as numbers in the wild
   continue to decline. Happily, both cubs are developing very well indeed
   and the health MOTs we’ve been able to perform confirmed that mum Nima
   is clearly doing a great job of caring for them.”

   James continued, “We also discovered the genders of each of the cubs -
   one male and one female - and returned them to their mum as soon as
   we’d finished giving them a quick once over. Nima took them straight
   back to her nest and it’ll be a few weeks now until the cubs start to
   develop the confidence to come out and explore by themselves. Before
   they’re able to stand on their own feet, it is though possible that
   some lucky people will have the occasional glimpse of Nima carrying
   them from nest to nest by the scruffs of their necks.”

   Red Pandas are found in the mountainous regions of Nepal, India,
   Bhutan, Myanmar and southern China where their wild number is estimated
   at fewer than 10,000 – a 40% decline over the past 50 years.

   This decrease is a direct result of human actions, such as widespread
   habitat destruction, trapping for the illegal pet trade and poaching
   for their iconic red fur – which in some countries is used to make hats
   for newly-weds as a symbol of happy marriage.

   Conservationists at Chester Zoo have called on the public help to fight
   the illegal wildlife trade that is driving species to extinction around
   the world. People can report any suspicious activity they may spot,
   online or on holiday, via the zoo’s online illegal wildlife trade
   reporting form: www.chesterzoo.org/illegalwildlifetrade

   In recent years, Chester Zoo has been fighting for the future of the
   Red Panda through habitat-focused conservation projects in the Sichuan
   Mountains of China, where they can be found among the bamboo forests.

‘The Wilds’ Sees Greater One-horned Rhino Birth

September 19, 2019

   1_Greater One-Horned Rhino Calf 1642 - Amanda Carberry Columbus Zoo and
   Aquarium

   The Wilds, in Cumberland, OH, proudly welcomed a Greater One-horned
   Rhinoceros calf on August 24.

   The female calf is receiving excellent care from her mother and is the
   eighth Greater One-horned Rhino to be born at The Wilds. The birth is a
   significant achievement as the species nearly went extinct during the
   20th century.

   The calf and mom, Sanya, are doing well and have been bonding in
   pasture on The Wilds property. The Animal Management team has been
   monitoring the pair closely and has not needed to provide any immediate
   assistance, as Sanya is an experienced mother and the calf appears to
   be strong and healthy. Calves usually weigh more than 100 pounds at
   birth and gain a few pounds every day. An adult Greater One-horned
   Rhino can reach weights of approximately 4,000 to 6,000 pounds.

   Sanya, born at the Toronto Zoo in 1999, has now given birth to five
   calves since arriving at The Wilds in 2004. The calf’s father, Jahi,
   was born at Zoo Tampa in 2011, moved to the Central Florida Zoo in 2013
   and then arrived at The Wilds in 2017 as per a breeding recommendation
   through the Species Survival Plan® (SSP), a program coordinated by the
   Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) to maintain genetic diversity
   of threatened and endangered species in human care. This newborn is
   Jahi’s first offspring.

   The Wilds, home to three Greater One-horned Rhinos, is one of only 30
   facilities in North America to care for this species. The Wilds is also
   home to 15 Southern White Rhinos. In total, more than 500 animals
   representing 28 species from around the world make up the animal
   population at the open-range, natural landscape at The Wilds.

   Once listed as an endangered species, the Greater One-horned Rhino
   (Rhinoceros unicornis) has seen a steady population increase thanks to
   strict government protection and is now listed by the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species
   as “Vulnerable”. According to the World Wildlife Fund, there were only
   600 individuals surviving in their native ranges of India and Nepal by
   1975. Since then, researchers estimate the population has grown to
   exceed 3,000 Greater One-horned Rhinos living in these areas.

   “We are thrilled to welcome this little rhinoceros into our Wilds
   family! Every rhinoceros is important to the survival of his or her
   species. While there has been some success in rhinoceros conservation
   recently, unfortunately, there are still threats to all rhino species.
   They are being poached for their horn, even though it is made only of
   keratin— the equivalent of fingernails—and they are facing habitat
   destruction in their native ranges. We are proud to be able to
   contribute to rhino conservation by welcoming this incredible new
   arrival, as the calf represents hope for future generations of Greater
   One-horned Rhinos,” said Dr. Jan Ramer, vice president of The Wilds.

   The new calf may be visible to guests during either an Open-Air Safari
   or Wildside Tour. For more information about The Wilds or to book your
   visit, please visit www.TheWilds.org .

Female White Rhino for Dubbo Zoo

September 18, 2019

   1_White Rhino calf - 5 days old

   Taronga Western Plains Zoo has welcomed a female White Rhino calf!

   The calf was born, behind-the-scenes, in the early hours of August 18
   to mother, Mopani, at 16 months gestation. The new baby weighed in at
   74kgs.

   “The calf required some initial veterinary assistance over the first
   two days of her life, but being a very strong calf went from strength
   to strength,” said Keeper Supervisor Pascale Benoit.

   “The calf is the third offspring for experienced mother Mopani, sired
   by White Rhino bull, Khulu who sadly passed away earlier this year.
   This birth heralds another breeding achievement for the rhino
   conservation breeding programs at Taronga Western Plains Zoo,” said
   Pascale.

   Pascale continued, “The team is thrilled to welcome another precious
   White Rhino. Being a female, this little one will one day play an
   important role in the regional breeding program, hopefully creating a
   new genetic bloodline.”

   Both Mopani and her calf are now on exhibit, along with two other
   females in the herd. Mopani is a very protective and caring mother and
   has bonded well with her calf. She is taking motherhood in her stride
   again.

   “We are really proud of Mopani and the maternal behaviors we are
   observing. She is very protective of her calf and is keeping the other
   herd members at a distance at present,” said Pascale.

   NSW Environment Minister, Matt Kean, thanked all the zoo staff for
   their incredible care for the new calf, as well as all the animals at
   Taronga Western Plains Zoo.

   “With about 19,000 White Rhinos left in the wild, every rhino birth is
   vital. It shows how critical the conservation work undertaken by
   Taronga is – not just for rhinos but our native animals that are also
   under threat. These conservation efforts wouldn’t be possible without
   the dedication from zoo staff.”

   The White Rhino calf is yet to be named. Taronga Western Plains Zoo is
   planning to run a naming competition on its Facebook page to help find
   a name for the newest member of the White Rhino herd.

   Taronga actively supports conservation efforts for wild rhinos in
   Africa, Indonesia and India, including providing funds and support for
   habitat and reforestation, anti-poaching and rhino protection units and
   reduction of human-animal conflict. Taronga is also a founding member
   of the International Rhino Foundation.

Paradise Park Hatches First Caribbean Flamingo

September 17, 2019

   1_Flamingo chick with egg at Paradise Park in Hayle Cornwall

   Staff at Paradise Park are thrilled at the hatching of their first
   Caribbean Flamingo chick!

   Director Alison Hales commented, “We love our flamingo group, and were
   delighted when two eggs were laid this summer. However one egg was
   infertile and then the second pair stopped incubating about a week too
   early. Keepers decided to put the egg in an incubator, not knowing if
   it would hatch, but within days the egg started chirping! The chick
   hatched successfully on 19th August – it’s early days but, so far, it’s
   growing well on two-hourly feeds of a special ‘fish soup’ prepared by
   Keeper Becky.”

   Keeper Becky Waite explained, “We are so excited to have a Caribbean
   Flamingo chick. Our flock was very small until last summer, when five
   arrived from Slimbridge Wetland Centre. With a bigger flock size, we
   were in a stronger position to achieve breeding success. One pair did
   lay an egg earlier in the summer, which sadly was not fertile. But this
   did trigger the flock to build nests. The shallow pond area is an ideal
   location as the mud is the perfect building material.”

   Becky continued, “Both parents were hatched at Chester Zoo in July
   2002, so are 17-years-old. They came to Paradise Park in 2004. This egg
   was laid on 20th July and hatched on 19th August, so took 31 days to
   incubate. Due to the parents having stopped incubating the egg a few
   days before it was due to hatch, we stepped in and put the egg in an
   incubator. For the first few days, I am feeding the chick every two
   hours between 6am and 10pm.”

   Flamingos form strong pair bonds, and just one egg is laid, with both
   male and female feeding the chick on a special ‘crop milk’. They are
   long-lived birds that can reach the age of 40, and are able to breed
   starting from age six.

   Paradise Park would like visitors to note that, at this time, the chick
   is not on display.

New Ibex Kids Explore at Hellabrunn Zoo

September 16, 2019

   1_Alpine Ibex_Hellabrunn_2019_Daniela Hierl (2)

   The Alpine Ibex enclosure at Hellabrunn Zoo gained two new
   members…Trapattoni and Theo. Born in late May and June, the two kids
   are said to be enthusiastically exploring the rocky terrain in their
   exhibit.

   Hellabrunn / Daniela Hierl

   Within just one hour after birth, an Alpine Ibex kid is able to follow
   its mother on rock cliffs. As they grow, so will their horns, which
   will reach over 1 meter long by the time they become adults. Large and
   backwards-curving, male horns are used to defend their territory and
   compete for the right to breed with available females. During fight
   rituals a male will challenge his rival by rearing up on his hind legs
   and using his horns to ram his opponent with great force.

   It will still be a while before the young Ibex at Hellabrunn are ready
   to assert their authority, but visitors will be able to see them
   practicing with their horns, which at present are only a few
   centimeters long.

   "A visit to the Alpine Ibex enclosure is definitely worthwhile,” said
   Rasem Baban, zoological director at Hellabrunn Zoo. “It’s always
   interesting to watch the little kids test their courage and try new
   things."

   In the mid-19th century, the Alpine Ibex (Capra ibex) was on the verge
   of extinction, primarily due to the demand for their curved horns and
   fur as coveted hunting trophies. Less than 100 individuals remained, at
   that time, and were only to be found in the Gran Paradiso National Park
   in northern Italy. The population has since recovered thanks to
   conservation efforts over the years. Today, the species is no longer
   classified as endangered.

   There are currently five populations of Alpine Ibex in Germany,
   including the regions of Bayrischzell, the Allgäu Alps, and the
   Benediktenwand.

   Hellabrunn Zoo is currently home to nine Alpine Ibex. In addition to
   the two kids and their mothers, there are four more females and one
   breeding male.

   The Alpine Ibex enclosure at the Zoo is located halfway between the
   Isar entrance and the new Mühlendorf village.

Lion Cubs Roar Into Woburn Safari

September 15, 2019

   69030329_10156787017053877_2443900296242397184_n

   Woburn Safari Park announced the arrival of two African Lion cubs,
   which were born to parents Zuri and Joco in late July. The cubs spend
   most of their time in the den with their mother but are expected to
   move into the Lion exhibit later this month.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpO-XPZG-CI

   Keepers have already spotted the youngsters playing with each other and
   with their mom’s tail and they are looking stronger on their legs every
   day. Born weighing just over two pounds each, the cubs will begin to be
   weaned from their mother onto meat at around 10-12 weeks old and will
   be fully weaned by the time they are 6-8 months old.

   Lioness Zuri, 5, is extremely protective of her new young, and
   naturally can become aggressive if disturbed. Keepers prepared for the
   birth by creating a secluded den in one compartment of the Lion house
   for Zuri and her cubs, so they can enjoy bonding in a quiet, private
   area. In the wild, a Lioness will give birth and keep her cubs in a den
   of thick dense cover, like acacia bushes, so keepers have tried to
   replicate this environment as much as possible.

   Keepers are feeding Zuri five days out of every seven, monitoring how
   much she eats each day to decide when she is fed. Normally the Lions
   are fed large meals every four days to mimic wild hunting patterns,
   including feast days and fast periods.

   Craig Lancaster, Team Leader for Carnivores at Woburn Safari Park,
   said, “It’s hugely exciting to have new Lion cubs at the Park and we
   are so pleased that they seem to be settling in so well. They aren’t
   crying a lot and are already looking chunky and healthy, which
   indicates that they are feeding well and are content in their
   surroundings.

   “The public will be able to view the cubs in the side pen after all
   their vaccinations are up to date in late September. We will ensure the
   vets are happy with their progress before they are moved into the main
   Lion enclosure later on in the year.”

   Once ranging across most of Africa, the Middle East, and southwestern
   Asia, Lions have suffered drastic population declines in the past 50
   years. Most of the 20,000-50,000 Lions remaining in Africa reside in
   protected areas such as parks and reserves. Tourism, and the revenue it
   creates, is a strong incentive for Lion conservation. These majestic
   Cats are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature.

Red Panda Triplets Born at Virginia Zoo

September 14, 2019

   Virginia Zoo Red Panda 4

   The Virginia Zoo announced the birth of triplet Red Panda cubs to Masu,
   a three-year-old female, and four-year-old dad Timur. The three cubs,
   two males and one female, were born off-exhibit at the Zoo’s Animal
   Wellness Campus on June 18, 2019. Red Panda cubs weigh approximately
   five ounces at birth, and by two months of age, the cubs each weighed
   just over one pound. The zoo announced the births in late August.

   “Having Red Panda triplets is a unique situation,” said Dr. Colleen
   Clabbers, the Zoo’s Veterinarian. “It’s a lot of work for mom to care
   for three newborns, but Masu is doing a great job caring for
   the triplets and all three have been thriving.”

   Masu, who had her first litter of cubs last year, gave birth in an
   indoor, climate-controlled den where she has been nursing and bonding
   with her cubs in this quiet environment. The den is not viewable by zoo
   guests and is monitored by Zoo Keepers and Animal Care Staff. Red Panda
   cubs typically remain in the nest with mom for about three months, even
   in the wild.

   Masu and the cubs will move back to the Red Panda exhibit later this
   fall when Keepers feel the little ones can confidently navigate the
   trees and other exhibit features.

   “Our Animal Care team had a great strategy last year in moving Masu to
   the Animal Wellness Campus while she was still pregnant, providing
   privacy for her first birth experience. She took great care of her cubs
   last year, which is why we opted to do the same thing again this time
   around,” said Greg Bockheim, Executive Director of the Virginia Zoo.

   The zoo auctioned naming rights for the cubs, but they have not yet
   announced the names.

   Red Pandas are tree-dwelling animals found in forested mountain habitat
   in Myanmar, Nepal, India, Bhutan, Tibet and China. While they share the
   same name as Giant Pandas, the two species are not closely related. Red
   Pandas are the only living member of their taxonomic family. Slightly
   larger than a domestic Cat and with markings similar to a Raccoon, Red
   Pandas have soft, dense reddish-brown and white fur. They feed mainly
   on bamboo, but also eat plant shoots, leaves, fruit and insects. Red
   Pandas are shy and solitary except when mating or raising offspring.

   Red Pandas are listed as Endangered by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature. Habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and
   inbreeding due to isolated populations contribute to the decline. There
   are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals estimated to remain in the
   wild.
