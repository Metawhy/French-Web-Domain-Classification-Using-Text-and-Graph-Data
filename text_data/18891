   A new world record has been achieved - the fastest descent of the
   highest mountain in Western Europe - the undeniably massive Mont Blanc.
   On September 4th, Nicolas Blanchard and David Bozon - two professional
   paragliders from Chamonix and creators of the EpicTV Chamonix Airways
   series - took on the challenge to descend Mont Blanc in the fastest
   time possible in hopes of beating the then-current 32-minute world
   record held by skiers Antoine Montegani and Nicolas Anthonioz. The two
   paragliders summited Mont Blanc and hastily set up their speed flying
   kit. They took off, flew in a straight line to the paragliding landing
   field of the Savoy, raced to their bikes, hopped on and made it to the
   church in the centre of Chamonix in just over 15 minutes. This is the
   video of their amazing feat. Can they be beaten? They don't think so.
   But that remains to be seen... New Speed World Record on Mont Blanc -
   Summit to Chamonix Centre in 15 Minutes! | EpicTV
