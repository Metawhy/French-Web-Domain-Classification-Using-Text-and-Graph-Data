DIY STRING LIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE

   Christmas trees, what’s not to love? But sadly, living in a small
   apartment doesn’t allow me to partake in a 3 metre high tree with all
   the trimmings, unless Ben and I want to sleep out in the liftwell.
   Instead, in the last few years we’re usually forced to find an
   alternative, with varying levels of success (post it note one was ok
   although a bit wonky, book shelf one didn’t work that well). This year,
   I decided to step up to the plate on the
   Christmas-tree-for-a-small-apartment front. Armed with one of the new
   Bosch IXO cordless screwdrivers I decided to combine a few of my
   favourite things – getting crafty, pine wood and fairy/string lights.
   Enter, the minimalist light tree, perfectly 2D for those of you with
   space constraints, and with all the drama of an actual Christmas tree,
   but without the messy clean up. Read on to see how.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNTc4JTJGMjMzODY2ND
   IxMzFfOTUzN2NmMTZhOF9iLmpwZw==?checksum=9a6bc7164a91034ec6b0bb8dc63c5e1
   b60aeee2a&amp;format=j]

   You need:
     * A piece of pine, mine was 1 metre x 2 metres (1.1 yards x 2.2
       yards) but you can make it as big or small as you want.
     * Bosch IXP cordless screwdriver
     * Around 25 2.5 cm screws
     * Fairy lights (we used a 5m long string)
     * Twine
     * Pencil
     * Measuring tape

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNjgyJTJGMjI4MzkzMj
   E0MTRfZTkyYjM2NGJkM19iLmpwZw==?checksum=595379e8d98c74ca8db8520d6d0b61f
   6fa147151&amp;format=j]

   How to

   1. Work out where the top of your tree will sit – I measured about 30cm
   (12 in) down from the top edge of the pine and used the measuring tape
   to find the middle point. Drill in a screw here.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNzE3JTJGMjMxNzE4Nz
   M2NDBfZDJiZDA0NzEyNl9iLmpwZw==?checksum=0f9248828878623e1aa54ff176917dc
   ef12bcefd&amp;format=j]

   2. Using your twine, work out the shape of your tree. Add two screws at
   the bottom and tie the triangle tree shape to use as a guide when you
   add the rest of your screws.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNjU2JTJGMjMxNzE4Nz
   M1MzBfODI2YWIxMjk4N196LmpwZw==?checksum=3dbbce178fc03bf6f1bf76da0769c1a
   ef4c1d38e&amp;format=j]

   3. Drill the screws in down the sides of the triangle shape around 10cm
   (4 in) apart. You’ll want to do one side first, and then move over to
   the other side, placing those screws roughly between the ones on the
   other side so the zig zag of the string lights will work. It would be a
   pretty daunting task if you were nailing them in (although still
   completely do-able), but the drill had me finished in 5 minutes.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNTc1JTJGMjM0Njc2Nj
   c2MDVfNDc3OWVhYTM0N196LmpwZw==?checksum=04ab343502734cc7f8d737f959b8302
   c6a69220e&amp;format=j]

   4. The finished screws should look like this.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtNi5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNTgwNiUyRjIzMzg1MT
   Q5NjcxXzA5YzRhZWVlZGVfei5qcGc=?checksum=2440c32a34bb62648704e819a9fa16f
   7e08bb980&amp;format=j]

   5. Take your string lights and, starting from the top, wind the cord
   around the outside of the screws.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNzQxJTJGMjI4MzkzMj
   E2MjRfMGYwODRlODBjOF96LmpwZw==?checksum=b7a26729ab4530dcdf337d32e2230c0
   52194b8d3&amp;format=j]

   6. Go all the way down to the bottom.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNzM0JTJGMjI4NDA5OD
   YxNjNfNWU1ZWU3M2ZhN19iLmpwZw==?checksum=e47d8dcc7eeb1ce50f432c4e8ba4c84
   88184e9ff&amp;format=j]

   7. Tuck the cord to the back of the piece of pine, and plug it into a
   socket. We used an extension cord to do this.

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtNi5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNTcwOCUyRjIzMzYwND
   I5NjUyXzZjOWY1NWYzNzFfYi5qcGc=?checksum=78848279cb90fe880ce24f665d3ef43
   d5f36839a&amp;format=j]

   Turn on the lights and PING!

   [aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZmYXJtMS5zdGF0aWNmbGlja3IuY29tJTJGNTc5JTJGMjM0Njc2Nj
   gwNjVfYzA0NTUwNTJkN19iLmpwZw==?checksum=7ab447623437b63d74129ad7412a172
   e8d5de029&amp;format=j]

   Stay tuned for lots more home projects, this Bosch cordless screwdriver
   has so many great attachments including for the home, office, on a boat
   or really wherever! I can’t wait to experiment more.

   2. Using your twine, work out the shape of your tree. Add two screws at
   the bottom and tie the triangle tree shape to use as a guide when you
   add the rest of your screws.

   3. Drill the screws in down the sides of the triangle shape around 10cm
   (4 in) apart. You’ll want to do one side first, and then move over to
   the other side, placing those screws roughly between the ones on the
   other side so the zig zag of the string lights will work. It would be a
   pretty daunting task if you were nailing them in (although still
   completely do-able), but the drill had me finished in 5 minutes.

   4. The finished screws should look like this.

   5. Take your string lights and, starting from the top, wind the cord
   around the outside of the screws.

   6. Go all the way down to the bottom.

   7. Tuck the cord to the back of the piece of pine, and plug it into a
   socket. We used an extension cord to do this.

   Turn on the lights and PING!
