Preschool Sticker Stories

   A month ago, I purchased a bunch of sticker books at A.C. Moore. I
   wasn't really sure what my plan for them was, but they were cute and
   cheap.
   One afternoon I needed to get a rambunctious group of boys to settle
   down and called them to the table. I grabbed my set of "Big Rig" truck
   stickers. I told them I was going to give them each a truck sticker,
   but first they had to draw a road to put their truck on. As the boys
   added to their pictures, I gave them more stickers: traffic cones,
   signs, and more trucks. They were all working so hard on their
   pictures, but I quickly realized that more importantly they were
   storytelling.  I also asked them what the weather was for their trucks.
   Some added suns and some added storms. Several of them had elaborate
   stories about their trucks having to go through the cones and the storm
   and more.
   I was pretty proud to see the rich language that came from that
   impromptu activity.
   Several weeks later I decided to try it again, but this time I wanted
   to record their stories. I chose pirate stickers this time. What I love
   the most about these stickers is that they had both girl and boy
   pirates (as it should be).  I worked with them in a similar way. As
   they added to their picture I would hand them another sticker. Here's a
   monkey, so now you might need to draw a tree.  Here's a whale can you
   draw some waves for him.
   This was a younger group (ages 2.5 to 3.5) and their "maps" didn't look
   like much,
   but they had quite the stories to tell.
   In January, we are working on building language and storytelling and
   I am excited to see what other stories they come up with during this
   month.

                                   [IMG_20190104_104232.jpg]
      The monkey is heading to the water and the ship is steering. The
                        captain is driving the ship.
           The whale is doing a backflip and a fo-fish and diving.
    The pirate is a diver. And the telescope is looking for the treasure.
                    The monkey is heading to the jungle.

                          [IMG_20190104_104217.jpg]

                                  [IMG_20190104_104210_1.jpg]
     The pirate is going to the treasure. And the pirate is going in the
                                    boat.
                     The pirate is going to the jungle.

                                    [IMG_20190104_104153.jpg]
    He is supposed to go to the ship and he's going to the deep deep dark
                                in the woods.
       In the jungle. He's going to the boat with his steering wheel.

                                     [IMG_20190104_103624.jpg]
   The pirate can't find the treasure. That stops the pirate from danger.
                 These things are water that gets the fire.
    The fire is getting closer to the pirate. But it's not getting closer
                               to the parrot.
             So the parrot is following the way to the treasure.

                                     [IMG_20190104_103241.jpg]
   The monkey was driving the boat and then he sinked in the boat. Then he
                                  realized
      the pirate came and saved him. And then a crocodile ate them. The
                                monkey found
   the treasure and the man came looking for him but the alligator ate him
                                 too quick.
              And then he went to bed and had a dream about it.

                                   [IMG_20190104_102757.jpg]
      The pirate is looking for treasure and a parrot. And the whale is
                        looking for an elephant seal.
   She misses her little pet seal. She's looking for that trap so she can
                                recognize it.

Here We Grow Again

   [IMG_20181213_174350.jpg]
   So I visit my here often. I look back. I reflect. I share these ideas
   from many years ago.
   There have been so many changes over the past several years, but the
   basis for this blog remains the same. Inch By Inch Preschool is focused
   on creating a sense of community through nature, play and friendship.
   I have recently decided to bring back this special place where I used
   to store and share all my thoughts.
   I would like to share my top five favorite posts (in no particular
   order) from the past and then I would like to move forward with a new
   journey. Please visit us on Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest.
   Thank you!

Friendship Soup 2015

   Every child brought an ingredient of their choice in to share. We all
   worked together to prepare the soup and then had a feast. The children
   were very proud!

Joining Hands (and Hearts) as Professionals: Part 2

   A couple months ago I posted Joining Hands as Professionals about a new
   adventure in my learning journey
   On September 19th five amazing people, Kimberley, Jerome, Annette, Amy,
   and Sally adventured here as "Team Maine" from England and I got to
   watch months of planning become real. My experience at the Play
   Iceland 2014 conference played a huge role in how I chose to plan and
   organize this next step of the journey.  I knew the importance of
   visiting different settings, but also ensuring there was time to
   reflect and compare notes with others at the end of each day.

                     [IMG_20150927_122751806_HDR.jpg]
               When we work together, we can climb mountains.

   The knowledge and experiences I gained from this would make a list far
   too long to share. I think overall the highlights of the experience
   were meeting, sharing, and collaborating with new early childhood
   practitioners from both near and far! I was able to reach out to and
   visit new settings and have visitors in my setting who had different
   perspectives. Forming a unique bond with a small group of individuals
   who can now extend the knowledge we gained back into other early years
   opportunities. I strongly believe we all grew as professionals and
   advocates for childhood, but also as individuals.
   The group that was formed was an international one, but this type of
   professional development could be easily planned with a local group of
   providers.
   My planning process and suggestions:
   The Planning
   I reached out to programs in a more populated area of my state. They
   were far enough away from my setting that there was not as much worry
   about being the competition. I think some of the appeal was having
   visitors from England visit their school, but there is no reason you
   can't form a small group of practitioners (or even just yourself) to
   visit other early childhood programs. It was easier for me to connect
   with these programs, because I was organizing for an outside group, but
   realized what a valuable experience this would be for anybody to do.
   These are beautiful programs right here at home, that I would never
   have experienced on my own and I had to ask myself "Why?"
   [received_10153608488463006.jpeg]
   I met several of the people in person ahead of time. It seems to be a
   growing trend that daycare providers and directors form small groups to
   meet with once a month to network and share ideas. I was able to sit in
   on one of these meetings in the area we would be visiting. I became
   familiar with many of the providers that we would be visiting.
   I set up specific dates and times with the programs during a three day
   period. And made sure that I was clear what type of involvement they
   wanted us to have while we were visiting. Some of the programs allowed
   us to be involved with the children's activities, while others
   preferred we sit quietly and take notes. Some allowed photos with
   children and others asked us to take photos without. We visited in
   pairs, so that we wouldn't overwhelm the staff or children, but would
   still be able to reflect with somebody after the visit.
   [20151007_141622.jpg]
   The Visits
   The team made time at the end of each day to discuss how our visits
   went and what we were going to take back to our own classrooms. It was
   so helpful to have a the small group of people to reflect with about
   the visits. I am happy that we mostly visited settings in pairs, so
   that we came to the "table" with more than one perspective on each
   setting.
   [20151007_141818.jpg]
   [20151007_142000.jpg]
   Reflection
   One of the directors (The Children's Center) was so enthusiastic about
   our visits that she and I planned an evening mixer where we could meet
   with her staff and have a chance to talk. "Team Maine" shared a video
   presentation of their settings at Child First Day Nurseries. It was a
   magical evening filled with inspiration and like-minded individuals who
   all shared the same passion for working with children.
   [254.JPG]
   [256.JPG]
   Hosting Visitors
   Another important part of the experience was having visitors observe
   and spend time with me at my preschool. They were able to share ideas,
   suggestions and feedback on our philosophies and daily routines. The
   relationships that were formed during our week together made it so easy
   to have them come into my classroom. I was so worried about the way the
   children would respond to so many new adult faces. Everybody was so
   comfortable with being there together. The children still ask about
   them and we have a picture hanging in our classroom. The impact that
   they left on us teachers and the children will never be forgotten.
   [20150923_190440.jpg]
   The Grand Finale: Joining Hands
   At the end of the week, I hosted a free event at my preschool and
   invited about 15 other practitioners to attend. The attendees were Team
   Maine, teachers from the some of the settings we had spent time in and
   also colleagues of mine from another state who were able to share
   photos and information about their settings.
   [FB_IMG_1445909028491.jpg]
    I had a tie-dyeing activity available in the middle of the day to give
   people a chance to be creative and to continue their discussions during
   a break. Everybody brought food to contribute for lunch.
   [FB_IMG_1445909034719.jpg]
   We had three different speakers and time in between to talk and
   share. I asked that people bring any paperwork they were willing to
   share including: handbooks, assessments, planning sheets, etc. We had
   time scheduled in for small group discussions and brainstorming, but
   unfortunately ran out of time. I think in the future two speakers would
   be sufficient at this type of workshop.
   There is just something about a room full of people talking about their
   love for children that will stick in your heart for a long time.
   Everybody just seemed so relaxed and happy to be there together sharing
   conversations about why we do what we do!

   change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." -Margaret
   Mead
   A special THANK YOU! to all the people who were involved in this
   amazing experience, including Tom Shea, Team Maine, all the settings
   that welcomed visitors into your programs, our wonderful speakers, and
   all of the teachers and providers who joined us in the evening and on a
   Saturday to share your passion!

All About Me: BIG and SMALL

   This week our intern Lacey planned a week of "All About Me," for her
   class. For today's activity each child had a turn to get traced and
   then paint themselves. It was a lot of fun and fascinating to see all
   their individual artistic styles through the way they decorated
   themselves.
   [IMG_20151020_095444643.jpg]
   Once the children were given the paint, we did not interfere with how
   they wanted to decorate their people.
   To some of them it was simply a giant piece of paper and they were not
   going to let that person outline get in the way of their painting.
   [IMG_20151020_101251674.jpg]
    For others it was a template for making a face and hair and a colorful
   outfit.
   [IMG_20151020_104618535_TOP.jpg]
   Some started with a face and hair, but enjoyed using the paint so much
   they painted right over the face when they ran out of blank space
   elsewhere.
   [IMG_20151020_102850954.jpg]
   Some chose to stay in the lines and others used the WHOLE paper. Some
   of them traced the outline with paint, while others made a few very
   intentional blobs of color and stated, "I'm done."
   [IMG_20151020_095406055.jpg]
   No matter their styles, they all really enjoyed having a turn being
   traced and seeing their "big" selves on the paper. They also loved
   having a large piece of space to create all on their own.
   [IMG_20151020_102519860.jpg] [IMG_20151020_102315490.jpg]
   [IMG_20151020_101101982_TOP.jpg]
   [IMG_20151020_094352106.jpg]
   We also have mini-me versions of everyone that they like to carry
   around and play with. This week we taped them upright on to blocks to
   encourage even more play with the photos.

                                  [IMG_20151020_130054765.jpg]
     I'm realizing right now that these are all girls in this picture. I
     just went to check and one (or more) of the children seemed to have
   created a boy shelf and a girl shelf. Not sure if it was intentional or
                           not. Very interesting!

                                  [IMG_20150916_094452258.jpg]
     This is such a fun way to get a group photo when everybody has such
                            different schedules.
