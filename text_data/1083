   Introduction

   The International Association of Privacy Professionals is a
   professional membership association for people who work in the field of
   information privacy and data protection. We do not knowingly attempt to
   solicit or receive information from children.

   We understand that you are aware of and care about your own personal
   privacy interests, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Notice
   describes the IAPP’s policies and practices regarding its collection
   and use of your personal data, and sets forth your privacy rights. We
   recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so
   we will from time to time update this Privacy Notice as we undertake
   new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.

   Data Protection Officer

   The IAPP is headquartered in New Hampshire, in the United States. The
   IAPP has appointed an internal data protection officer for you to
   contact if you have any questions or concerns about the IAPP’s personal
   data policies or practices. The IAPP’s data protection officer’s name
   and contact information are as follows:

   Rita Heimes
   IAPP
   75 Rochester Avenue
   Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA
   dpo@iapp.org
   +1 603-427-9200
   arrow_upward Back to top
   How we collect and use (process) your personal information

   The IAPP collects personal information about its members and other
   customers. With a few exceptions, this information is limited to the
   kinds of information that can be found on a business card: first name,
   last name, job title, employer name, work address, work email, and work
   phone number. We use this information to provide members and customers
   with goods and services, including membership services, privacy and
   data protection content, certification, training, and the like. We do
   not sell personal information to anyone and only share it with third
   parties who are facilitating the delivery of IAPP services.
   How we collect and use (process) your personal information close
    1. Personal information you give to us:
         1. Membership
            When you become an IAPP member, we collect information about
            you including (but not limited to) your name, your employer’s
            name, your work address (including your country location), and
            your email address. We may also collect your personal email
            address, a personal mailing address, and a mobile phone
            number. We ask members to voluntarily provide additional
            information in their membership profile, such as information
            about their educational background, number of years in
            privacy, and the like. Members may edit their profile at any
            time to change, add, or remove personal information.
            We process your personal information for membership
            administration, to deliver member benefits to you, and to
            inform you of IAPP-related events, content, and other benefits
            or opportunities associated with your IAPP membership. The
            IAPP may also use this information to help the IAPP understand
            our members’ needs and interests to better tailor our products
            and services to meet your needs.
            Members often participate in local KnowledgeNet chapter
            meetings. These meetings are organized by volunteers
            (KnowledgeNet chapter chairs) and take place at various
            locations that donate their space for the meetings. The IAPP
            collects registration information from IAPP members and their
            guests, which it shares with the KnowledgeNet chapter chairs
            and location hosts for purposes of verifying registration and
            to ensure only registered guests are allowed attendance.
            The IAPP relies on fulfillment of contract as the lawful basis
            under GDPR Article 6 for processing members’ personal
            information.
         2. Live events and web conferences
            The IAPP hosts many events throughout the year. These include
            in-person conferences like the Global Privacy Summit and the
            Data Protection Congress, for example, as well as live web
            conferences (collectively “events”). If you register for one
            of our events and you are a member, we will access the
            information in your member account to provide you with
            information and services associated with the event. If you are
            not a member and you register for one of our events, we will
            collect your name and contact information, which we will store
            in our database(s) and use to provide you with information and
            services associated with the event. We process this
            information to fulfill the order you have made to receive the
            event or web conference services.
            If you are a presenter at one of our events, we will collect
            information about you including your name, employer and
            contact information, and photograph, and we may also collect
            information provided by event attendees who evaluated your
            performance as a presenter. We may also make and store a
            recording of your voice and likeness in certain instances. The
            IAPP relies on a legitimate interest basis for collecting,
            storing and processing this information.
            We keep a record of your participation in IAPP events as an
            attendee or presenter. This information may be used to provide
            you with membership and certification services (such as, for
            example, keeping track of your Continuing Privacy Education
            (CPE) credits, or to tell you about other events and
            publications). It may also be used to help the IAPP understand
            our members’ needs and interests to better tailor our products
            and services to meet your needs.
            In association with attending one or more of our conferences,
            you will have the option to download the “IAPP Events App” to
            help you navigate the conference and plan your schedule. The
            IAPP Events App may require the device identifier associated
            with your device but does not collect or use any other
            personal data.
            Some of our events are sponsored. The IAPP provides an
            attendee list to sponsors, co-sponsors and exhibitors of our
            events. The IAPP may also allow sponsors, co-sponsors and/or
            exhibitors to send you material by mail once per sponsored
            event, in which case the IAPP engages a third-party mailing
            house and does not share your mailing address directly with
            the sponsor/exhibitor. If you do not wish to have your
            information included in an attendee list or to receive
            information from sponsors, co-sponsors and/or exhibitors, you
            can express your preferences when you register for events or
            you may contact the IAPP directly at dpo@iapp.org. Sharing
            your personal information with a sponsor allows you to receive
            the content for free. We do give attendees a choice not to
            receive marketing messages from the sponsor or from the IAPP.
            Exhibitors at IAPP events may wish to scan your badge so they
            can contact you with more information. The IAPP uses Expo
            Logic to provide badge scanning services to exhibitors who
            request it. By allowing an exhibitor to scan your badge you
            are consenting to have Expo Logic provide the exhibitor with
            your contact information, and thereafter you may be contacted
            by the exhibitor post-event. If you do not wish the exhibitor
            to contact you, please communicate this directly with the
            exhibitor at the event or thereafter.
         3. Publications
            The IAPP offers a great deal of content for our members. In
            addition to producing original content, the IAPP also
            subscribes to news feeds and blogs produced by others, which
            we often link to from our website. This means you may find
            yourself on the IAPP website or reading an email from the IAPP
            publications team and we will offer you a link to another
            organization’s website where you will find content on privacy
            or data protection that we find relevant and useful to you. At
            these times, you will be leaving the IAPP website. The IAPP is
            not responsible or liable for content provided by these third
            party websites or personal information they may happen to
            gather from you.
            You may wish to subscribe to the IAPP’s publications without
            becoming a member of the IAPP. For example, many people sign
            up to receive the IAPP’s Daily Dashboard even though they are
            not IAPP members. To receive IAPP newsletters by email, you
            will need to create a “profile” with us which involves
            providing the IAPP with at least your first name and last
            name, an email address, and the country in which you live. The
            IAPP does not share this information with any third party
            other than to store the information in our cloud-hosted
            databases. We rely on a contract basis to process your
            personal information for purposes of fulfilling your request
            to receive our publications. You may at your own option choose
            to subscribe to IAPP News and updates which may be considered
            direct marketing.
            You may manage your IAPP subscriptions by subscribing or
            unsubscribing at any time. Please note that if you have set
            your browser to block cookies, this may have an impact on your
            ability to unsubscribe. If you have any difficulties managing
            your email or other communication preferences with the IAPP,
            please contact us at dpo@iapp.org.
            The IAPP uses Google Analytics to track how often people gain
            access to or read our content. We use this information in the
            aggregate to understand what content our members find useful
            or interesting, so we can produce the most valuable content to
            meet your needs.
            We also conduct surveys that we use to produce original
            research on the privacy profession. We do not track
            individuals but look at information in the aggregate only.
            Participation in surveys is voluntary.
         4. Training
            If you participate in IAPP training, you may sign up directly
            through the IAPP in which case we collect your name and
            contact information directly from you. You may, alternatively,
            sign up for training – or be signed up for training – by or
            through a third party such as one of our training partners, or
            your own employer. We may also use independent contractors to
            conduct the training and third parties to provide the training
            venue. Your personal information will be stored in our
            database (hosted by a cloud service provider) and may also be
            shared with our training partners, trainers, and/or the venue
            hosting the event (to verify your identity when you arrive).
            The IAPP uses a third-party data hosting service to transfer
            the information from training partners to the IAPP. The IAPP’s
            training partners, trainers, training venue hosts, and data
            transfer hosts have agreed not to share your information with
            others and not to use your personal information other than to
            provide you with IAPP products and services. The IAPP relies
            on fulfillment of a contract to process personal data
            associated with providing training services.
         5. Certification
            When you sign up to take one of the IAPP’s certification
            exams, we will collect your name and contact information. We
            will also collect and store information you provide to us
            about your need for special accommodations. This information
            may be shared with our computer-based exam hosting service.
            The computer-based exam hosting service may also share with us
            information you provide to them to verify your identity in
            taking the exam. The IAPP will collect your exam results and,
            in conjunction with maintaining your certification(s), your
            record of participation in continuing privacy education. Only
            authorized employees within the IAPP have access to your
            certification exam scores and personal information pertaining
            to any special accommodations you may request. The IAPP relies
            upon a contract fulfillment basis to process personal data
            associated with providing certification services.
         6. Your correspondence with the IAPP
            If you correspond with us by email, the postal service, or
            other form of communication, we may retain such correspondence
            and the information contained in it and use it to respond to
            your inquiry; to notify you of IAPP conferences, publications,
            or other services; or to keep a record of your complaint,
            accommodation request, and the like. As always, if you wish to
            have the IAPP “erase” your personal information or otherwise
            refrain from communicating with you, please contact us at
            dpo@iapp.org.
            Note: if you ask the IAPP not to contact you by email at a
            certain email address, the IAPP will retain a copy of that
            email address on its “master do not send” list in order to
            comply with your no-contact request.
            The IAPP has a legitimate interest in maintaining personal
            information of those who communicate voluntarily with the
            IAPP.
         7. Purposes for processing your data
            As explained above, the IAPP processes your data to provide
            you with the goods or services you have requested or purchased
            from us, including membership services, events, publications
            and other content, certification, and training. We use this
            information to refine our goods and services to better tailor
            them to your needs and to communicate with you about other
            services the IAPP offers that may assist you in your career or
            otherwise help you do your job as a privacy professional. Most
            of the time, the IAPP needs to process your personal data to
            fulfill an order for goods or services – including membership
            services, with all the attendant benefits and professional
            opportunities the IAPP provides. Sometimes the IAPP has a
            legitimate interest in processing data to better understand
            the needs, concerns, and interests of IAPP members and
            customers so the IAPP can operate optimally as an association
            and as a business. And sometimes, the IAPP relies upon your
            consent, in which case we will keep a record of it and honor
            your choices.
         8. Payment card information
            You may choose to purchase goods or services from the IAPP
            using a payment card. Typically, payment card information is
            provided directly by users, via the IAPP website, into the
            PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the IAPP
            subscribes, and the IAPP does not, itself, process or store
            the card information. Occasionally, members or customers ask
            IAPP employees to, on their behalf, enter payment card
            information into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing
            service to which the IAPP subscribes. We strongly encourage
            you not to submit this information by email. When IAPP
            employees receive payment card information from customers or
            members by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as
            instructed and then deleted or destroyed.
    2. Personal information we get from third parties
       From time to time, the IAPP receives personal information about
       individuals from third parties. This may happen if your employer is
       a corporate member of the IAPP and signs you up for training,
       certification, or membership. One of our third-party training
       partners may also share your personal information with the IAPP
       when you sign up for training, certification or membership through
       that training partner.
    3. What happens if you don’t give us your data
       You can enjoy many of the IAPP’s services without giving us your
       personal data. Much of the information on our website is available
       even to those who are not IAPP members. You can even enter only the
       minimal amount of information (name and contact information) to
       your IAPP member profile if you wish, and you can edit your profile
       at any time. Some personal information is necessary so that the
       IAPP can supply you with the services you have purchased or
       requested, and to authenticate you so that we know it is you and
       not someone else. You may manage your IAPP subscriptions and you
       may opt-in or opt-out of receiving marketing communication at any
       time.

       The IAPP makes available a comprehensive Cookie Notice that
       describes the cookies used on the IAPP website and provides
       information on how users can accept or reject them. To view the

     * Do not track
       The IAPP tracks users when they cross from our primary public
       website (iapp.org) to our “IAPP community” portion of the site
       (my.iapp.org) by logging in with their user name and password, as
       well as when visitors to our website enter through a marketing
       landing page (pages.iapp.org). The IAPP also keeps a record of
       third party websites accessed when a user is on the IAPP site and
       clicks on a hyperlink. But the IAPP does not track users to
       subsequent sites and does not serve targeted advertising to them.
       The IAPP does not, therefore, respond to Do Not Track (DNT)
       signals.

   Transferring personal data from the EU to the US

   The IAPP has its headquarters in the United States. Information we
   collect from you will be processed in the United States. The United
   States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the
   European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. The IAPP relies on
   derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the
   GDPR. In particular, the IAPP collects and transfers to the U.S.
   personal data only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you;
   or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of the IAPP in a manner
   that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. The IAPP endeavors to
   apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your
   personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with
   the IAPP and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. The IAPP
   also enters into data processing agreements and model clauses with its
   vendors whenever feasible and appropriate.

   Data subject rights

   This Privacy Notice is intended to provide you with information about
   what personal data the IAPP collects about you and how it is used. If
   you have any questions, please contact us at dpo@iapp.org.

   If you wish to confirm that the IAPP is processing your personal data,
   or to have access to the personal data the IAPP may have about you,
   please contact us at dpo@iapp.org.
   Data subject rights close

   The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and other
   countries’ privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects. A
   good explanation of them (in English) is available on the website of
   the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office.

   This Privacy Notice is intended to provide you with information about
   what personal data the IAPP collects about you and how it is used. If
   you have any questions, please contact us at dpo@iapp.org.

   If you wish to confirm that the IAPP is processing your personal data,
   or to have access to the personal data the IAPP may have about you,
   please contact us at dpo@iapp.org.

   You may also request information about: the purpose of the processing;
   the categories of personal data concerned; who else outside the IAPP
   might have received the data from the IAPP; what the source of the
   information was (if you didn’t provide it directly to the IAPP); and
   how long it will be stored. You have a right to correct (rectify) the
   record of your personal data maintained by the IAPP if it is
   inaccurate. You may request that the IAPP erase that data or cease
   processing it, subject to certain exceptions. You may also request that
   the IAPP cease using your data for direct marketing purposes. In many
   countries, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate
   data protection authority if you have concerns about how the IAPP
   processes your personal data. When technically feasible, the IAPP
   will—at your request—provide your personal data to you or transmit it
   directly to another controller.

   Reasonable access to your personal data will be provided at no cost to
   IAPP members, conference attendees and others upon request made to the
   IAPP at dpo@iapp.org. If access cannot be provided within a reasonable
   time frame, the IAPP will provide you with a date when the information
   will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, the IAPP will
   provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.

   information you transmit through use of this Site, we maintain
   physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test
   our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your

   Data storage and retention

   Your personal data is stored by the IAPP on its servers, and on the
   servers of the cloud-based database management services the IAPP
   engages, located in the United States. The IAPP retains data for the
   duration of the customer’s or member’s business relationship with the
   IAPP and for a period of time thereafter to allow members to recover
   accounts if they decide to renew, to analyze the data for IAPP’s own
   operations, and for historical and archiving purposes associated with
   IAPP’s history as a membership association. For more information on
   where and how long your personal data is stored, and for more
