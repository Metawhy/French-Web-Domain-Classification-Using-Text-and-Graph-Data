Mother's Day Ideas and a {FREEBIE}!

   Hi Friends!
      Let me start by saying Happy Teacher's Appreciation!!  It's that
   time of year when everything starts piling up, and it's really hard to
   keep up with it all!
      With field day, end of year testing, paperwork, report cards, and of
   course, TEACHING, it gets a little overwhelming! On top of that,
   Mother's Day is this weekend, and sometimes we found ourselves
   scrounging for something to do that's, easy, cute and heartfelt.
      Here are some things I've done in the past, and I thought I'd pass
   along some ideas that worked for me.
   [Picture6.png]
   Last year and this year, we made these adorable clay fingerprint
   necklaces.  I got the idea from the fabulous Lory Evans, and they were
   a huge hit. The kids and the mommas absolutely loved them!!
   You get Sculpey Oven-Bake Clay (one box will be plenty!). Roll it out
   like dough, and use a heart-shaped cookie cutter.  Cut out the hearts,
   and have students use their pointer finger to make two fingerprints to
   make a heart.
   Make sure you put the hole in it while the clay is still pliable.  Bake
   at 275 degrees for 15 minutes. Paint with acrylic pant, let dry, string
   and VOILA!
   {You can also use colored Sculpey clay and avoid the painting if you
   would like}
   [Picture5.png]
    A couple years ago, we made these super cute tea towels.  You get
   really heavy grit sandpaper (40 grit, no more than 60), and flour sack
   tea towels. You can find all this at WalMart for pretty cheap.  The
   kids will draw a SIMPLE picture on the sandpaper. *The image needs to
   be the mirror of what you want it to look like on the towel*
   Lay the tea towel down on an ironing board, then put the sand paper
   drawing face down onto the tea towel. Place an old towel in between the
   sand paper and your iron and press.  You will leave your iron for a few
   seconds until it's hot enough and the image will transfer onto the
   towel.
   Throw the towels into the dryer for 1-2 minutes to set, and you're
   done!  I have former parents that STILL have these towels and they've
   washed them successfully.  Big hit!
   {The sandpaper EATS the crayons, so be prepared to go through a bunch
   while doing this!}
   [Picture3.png]
    Handprint bags!   I grabbed these totes for about 50 cents a piece at
   Garden Ride (At Home, now).  It's pretty self explanatory, but I just
   painted their little hands, and placed around a circle in the middle of
   the bag.  The kids then painted the stem, and we laid them out to dry.
    Easy peasy, lemon squeezy!
   [Picture4.png]
   Lastly, we are making these cute little booklets for our mama's this
   year. My kids are so excited about their little cupcake books, and I
   wanted to share them with you, too!!

   the happiest of Teacher Appreciation Weeks, too!  I hope you all have a
   moment this week when you realize just how much of a difference you
   make each and every day.  As always, thanks for stopping by!!

Hands-On Double Digit Addition: Good Times!

   Hi Friends!
       We began our state standardized testing today, and that means my
   little first graders were all out of sorts.  I am so thankful that we
   don't have to test in the lower grades, but splitting classes, schedule
   changes, and all that other craziness has us trying to keep busy and
   engaged!
        I have been teaching double digit addition & subtraction for 15
   years, and it's always so boring...to me AND the kids.  Today, I tried
   something a little different, and I'm so glad I did!
   [Picture1.png]
   The kids have been working on double digit addition for a few days, and
   I wanted to do something that would get them UP and moving while still
   practicing the skill.
   I found some old dominoes on the game shelf & with the line right down
   the middle to divide the tens and ones, I knew they'd be perfect!
   [Picture2.png]
   I went through them and found pairs that would not require regrouping.
   I put each pair in a snack size baggie, and labeled each one with a
   letter.  *I always use letters in math to try and keep the confusion at
   bay*
   I ended up with 24 pairs, which was perfect for my class.  I put one
   set at each desk around the room and even at my kidney table.
   [Picture4.png]
   We've played SCOOT games before, so we just ran through a few practice
   runs of which direction to "scoot" and got started.
   [Picture5.png]
   At each "station", the kids took the two dominoes out of the baggie and
   created their own double digit addition problem.  They then had to
   write the problem and solve!
   [Picture6.png]
   I put the letters in random order so they had to pay attention to their
   baggie & make sure to record their problem in the correct square..
   [Picture7.png]
   They did such a great job lining up the tens and ones and creating
   their problems!  I started the game off with about 2 minutes on the
   timer, but as they got the hang of it, I went to 1 minute per problem,
   and it was perfect.
   [Picture9.png]
   The timer would go off, and the whole class would (whisper) yell,
   "SCOOT!" and move around the room.  It was so much fun!
   It took a total of about 35 minutes to go through all the stations, but
   I was able to walk around and see who really "got it" and who needed
   some extra help.  Plus, it kept the kids busy & engaged...keeping me
   very happy!! :)
   [Picture8.png]
   Just a quick and easy game to play to practice this {sometimes} boring
   skill!
    If you want a grab a copy of the recording sheet & give it a try in
   your room, click {HERE} to get the freebie. It's nothing fancy, but it
   works!  Every lesson isn't pretty, but I think that is totally okay!
   As always, thanks for stopping by!
    I hope your week is going well...and you're on the countdown to
   summer. 23 left for us!
    How about you? :)

Teaching Compare & Contrast: An Easier Way

   Hi Friends!
       Long time, no see! If you're like me, this year has just been
   flying by, and I can hardly believe we are in the final 6 weeks of
   school.  It's insane!  I feel like I still have SO much to do, and so
   little time to get it all done.
       Lately, we have been working on comparing and contrasting.
   Teaching this skill to first graders is usually the source of a lot of
   grey hair for me. It can be so abstract to six year olds, and I end up
   beating my head against the wall.
       We've discussed comparing and contrasting throughout the year in
   whole group reading lessons, and while my kids "kinda" get it, they
   weren't showing a lot of mastery.
       I decided to try a different approach, and implemented some small
   group skill instruction in my Guided Reading groups.
   [1.png]
        I started with a mini lesson to review what we already know about
   Compare and Contrast. Using these posters, I started by having the kids
   tell me what it means to compare and give me some examples of the
   similarities in the picture.
   [2.png]
   Coming up with similarities always seems easier than identifying
   differences, so we practiced with this card, and then came up some
   examples at our small group.
   Next, we moved on to contrasting.  Using the same format, the children
   identified the differences they could SEE in the picture.
   [3.png]
    I then led a discussion about what differences we might not be able to
   see.  We have been doing a lot of inferencing, so I wanted to tie that
   into our skill lesson.
    We reviewed the vocabulary, and then discussed how we can use a Venn
   Diagram to organize our information. In former lessons, we used giant
   sorting circles to create Venn Diagrams on the floor, so this was a bit
   of a review, but I really wanted the kids to have a visual for our
   activity.
   [5.png]
   After the mini lesson, we moved onto to our guided practice.  The kids
   read passages that discussed the similarities and differences of two
   familiar things, like cars and airplanes for this group.  {Other groups
   had different topics}
   [6.png]
   Next, they sorted phrases related to the topic (and found in the
   passage) for their Venn Diagram. [7.png]
   Here are some examples from my others groups.
   They were reading about bats and birds...
   [8.png]
   and spiders and insects!
   [9.png]
   I just loved seeing them go back and actually LOOK FOR and FIND the
   information!!  Yay, the reading strategies are working!! :)
   With my lower group, we used highlighters during our guided practice to
   locate the similarities and differences.  I read the story aloud, then
   we choral read for understanding.  Next, we read each phrase and
   highlighted it to determine where it belonged in our Venn Diagram.
   Last, we cut and paste!
   [11.png]
   It was a huge success!!  We've been working through more passages all
   week!
    Lately, I have been reading a lot about implementing skill groups into
   small group instruction, and I have to say, I'm loving it!  I have
   "Reading Groups" where we work on reading strategies, fluency and
   comprehension, and now I'm working with skill groups, too!
   I really look forward to figuring out a great way to mesh the two, but
   for right now, I'll do what's working :)

   sample {here}.

      As always, thanks for stopping by!!  I hope you can use these
   activities, or create your own! It's the best way I've found for
   teaching this skill, and the kids really loved it!! (and not to
   mention, we got to practice those cut and paste skills, too!)  Happy
   Day!

It's Okay to "Just Read" to Your Students!

   I wanted to be a teacher my entire life. I honestly can't remember a
   time when I didn't want to teach, and in all those years, there was
   this image in my head of sitting in a big ole rocking chair reading to
   my students while they hung on every word, eyes lit up with excitement
   and wonder, and smiles as wide as the room!
   Fast forward to the actual job of teaching, and often times, we see
   children sitting on the carpet for Story Time and that sparkle and
   curiosity is dim.  Not at all like in the idealistic pictures of my
   youth.
   Some years ago, I was calling my first graders to the carpet for a
   lesson using one of my favorite books.  I hear a collective "ugh" from
   several of my kiddos. Now, this wasn't a groan I heard very often, so I
   had to investigate.
   I asked, "Why the groaning? You don't want to listen to a great
   story?"
   The response?  "Every time you read to us, we have to DO something".
   My first reaction was to assume the kids didn't want to do the work.
   And then I really got to thinking about it.  Why is it that every
   single time we, as teachers, bring a book out, it's followed by an
   activity, a test, or some other assignment?  When did we stop JUST
   READING to our kids?
   [Just%2BRead1.png]
   I realized that there are children that view books and stories
   negatively because there was always "work" attached to it.
   There was always a catch!  "I'll read you a great story, but you're
   going to have to work when we're finished!"
   Many children had never had the opportunity to just listen to and
   immerse themselves in a story.  It made me sad, and I knew that as much
   as I loved my teachers reading to me as a kid, I wanted to pass that
   along.
   I know with all of the standards we have to teach, and the push to
   maintain the integrity of our instructional time that we are left with
   very little "extra" time.  I also know that there are those who believe
   that read alouds with no assignment are a waste of time, or "fluff" as
   I was once told.
   I disagree.
   How can teaching children the love of reading and books be fluff or a
   waste of time?  As a first grade teacher, that is one of my most
   important jobs...to instill a lifelong love of learning.
   [Just%2BRead%2B2.png]
   A gift.  Don't you just love the thought of that?  With each story
   read, you are giving a gift to your students.  That idea just makes me
   happy.
   Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge proponent of incorporating
   literature into every area of my teaching and into all subject areas.
   Most of the books in my classroom library are tied to a lesson that I
   will teach at some point, and all of those lessons involve an activity
   or assignment for my kids. Close Reading is one of the best things I
   have done in my classroom, and I am a huge supporter of teaching kids
   to THINK about text; however, I think we need to find some balance,
   too.
   I read this quote by the wonderful Mem Fox, as she was talking about
   speaking to parents about reading. She said "When I say to a parent
   'read to a child', I don't want it to sound like medicine, I want it to
   sound like chocolate".
    I want that too.  I want kids to think of books like I think of
   chocolate... perfect and wonderful...and something I can't wait to get
   my hands on!
   So, I say, it's okay to JUST READ.
   Because it teaches children to JUST listen, JUST imagine, JUST dream,
   JUST wonder, JUST think, JUST love books.
    What do you think?

Penguin Prefixes & Suffixes

   Hi Y'all!
      Happy New Year!!  I hope you all had a wonderful holiday, and the
   new year is already off to a great start! I've been MIA for a little
   while with the craziness of the holidays and then I moved over the
   break, which just added to the mania.  I'm back, though, and excited to
   start sharing with you again. :)
      We started back to school on Tuesday and we've spent the last few
   days reviewing material and...if we are keeping it real here... doing
   some of the things that honestly just didn't get done before the
   break.
       In language arts, we have been working with prefixes and suffixes.
   Our standard is to be able to identify root words, and use inflectional
   endings appropriately, but I always like to go ahead & introduce
   prefixes  during this unit.
   [Picture1.png]
    The kids helped me make the anchor chart over a couple days after we
   had really gone over the material in depth.  The inflectional endings
   we focus on are -s, -ed, and -ing for verbs and -s, -es, and -ies for
   nouns.  We also look at -ies for one syllable verbs that end in y like
   "cry", "fly" and "try".
   [Picture2.png]
      Here is our flip flap book for suffixes -s, -ed, and -ing.  The kids
   circle the root word and highlight the suffix. Then, they cut and paste
   them under the correct flip flap.
   Root words and inflectional endings are always a little tricky for my
   first graders, so I like to keep our weekly activities pretty
   consistent. It helps with reinforcing the material, and it makes my job
   of explaining the activity even easier!!
   [Picture3.png]
    So, we did the same kind of books each day to go with our focus.
   The kids really loved them & I noticed how much better they understood
   the material.
   If you would like a copy of all three flip flap books, click {HERE} for
   the FREEBIE.
   Since we've been studying penguins this week, I had to incorporate them
   into our little unit, too!
   [Picture4.png]
    For our Ticket-Out-The-Door summarizer, I passed out sticky notes with
   words using all of the suffixes and prefixes we have studied this
   week.  They had to circle the root word, box the suffix or prefix, and
   then come up to the board and stick it under the correct penguin.
   They did such a great job!
   [Picture5.png]
   To assess the kiddos, they did like quick little cut & paste
   activity.
   Circle the root word & paste it under the correct heading. Easy peasy!
   [Picture6.png]
    I have updated this document & you can grab this little assessment by
   clicking the picture below.
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0oeFcRnEpI9Z091YnhaSURVd0E/view?usp=s
   haring
   So, that's it folks. Just a regular week in the classroom just trying
   to get back into the swing of things! I hope you can use some of these
   resources and, as always, thanks for stopping by!! :)

Pinterest Pick 3 Linky: November

   November? Seriously?  It feels like we just started school, and it's
   already time for all things holiday, beginning with so many fun things
   to do for Thanksgiving.
   Today, I am linking up with some fabulous bloggers to share my top 3
   favorite Pins for the month of November.
   [Pick%2B3%2BNovember.jpg]
   What did we do before Pinterest?  I remember the old days of scrounging
   through MailBox magazines and Teachers Helper to come up with great
   ideas for each month. Now, it's all at my fingertips and I absolutely
   love it. Pinterest has definitely broadened the horizons of ideas for
   so many teachers, including me!
   Here are my Top 3 faves this month that I can't wait to use in my
   classroom!
   [When%2Byou%2Bdo%2Bit%2Bfor%2Bme..jpg]
   One of my favorite Thanksgiving books is Twas' the Night Before
   Thanksgiving.  It is such a fun and cute story and the kids always love
   the end. If you haven't read it, I won't spoil the ending, but this is
   such a cute craft & writing activity to go along with the story. I
   can't wait to use it with my first graders. Do you see the little
   feathers hanging out?
   https://www.pinterest.com/pin/55872851604315633/
   [2nov.JPG]
    Who doesn't love a cute turkey?
   These cuties from Cara at The First Grade Parade are to die for.
   Look at those eyes! I know my kids will just love these, and I'm always
   looking for a cute hallway display, and anything to accompany good
   writing!
   https://www.pinterest.com/pin/55872851604315632/
   [3%2Bnov.JPG]
   While I obviously love all things turkey this time of year, I also like
   to spend some time teaching my first graders about the real reason we
   celebrate Thanksgiving...about the Pilgrims and Native Americans & that
   treacherous journey to find a new home.
   I found this pin from First Grade a la Carte and knew that this would
   be a great way to teach my firsties about the first Thanksgiving.
   https://www.pinterest.com/pin/55872851604315701/
   You make the bracelets to go along with the story.
   Such a fun and age-appropriate way to do this, and the kids get
   practice retelling, too!
   https://www.pinterest.com/pin/55872851604315732/
   I hope you found something you can use this month!  For more ideas,
   check out these other bloggers who have linked up with their favorite
   pins! The linky is open for the month, so if you have something you'd
   like to share, please do!  As always, thanks for stopping by! :)

4 Types of Sentences: Mummy Style! {freebie}

   Hi Y'all!  Well, it's a wrap...well, almost.  October is almost over,
   and we are soaking up all things spooky in first grade.With a full
   moon, Red Ribbon Week, Halloween, and super crazy rain, we are working
   hard on staying engaged while celebrating all the fun this week has to
   offer!
    So, speaking of wrap, today I wanted to share a super fun activity we
   did while learning about the four types of sentences.
   [Picture1.png]
   Since it's Halloween week, I love digging through all my fun books to
   find texts that lend themselves to our language arts skills.  Our focus
   has been on the 4 Types of Sentences & Where's My Mummy? was absolutely
   perfect for this lesson!! It has all four types of sentences in the
   story & the kids were able to identify them as we read.
   We started with our anchor chart, where the kids gave me examples of
   each type of sentence
   [Picture2.png]
   We practiced acting out each type with some motions.
   Declarative:  I like pizza. (stomp for the period)
   Interrogative:  Can you help me? (Hands up and out for the question
   mark)
   Exclamatory: This is so much fun!  (Hands straight up in the air like a
   cheer for the exclamation point)
   Imperative: Stop running! (Pointing straight out like Uncle Sam for the
   exclamation point for period)
   Then, we moved on to reading our story & making our mummies!
   Each child got a mummy template (actually a gingerbread man, but hey,
   it worked!).
   [Picture3.png]
   I ran the templates on black construction paper & then outlined in
   white crayon for those that needed help seeing where to cut.
   Then, I laid out a bunch of pre-cut white strips on each table.
   The kids just glued down the strips to cover up their mummy. Then, they
   turned their mummies over & cut around the edges to remove the excess
   white paper from the strips.
   [Picture4.png]

   We glued some crazy colored googly eyes to each mummy to complete the
   craft.
   Each student was then given four speech bubbles, and they have to write
   an example of each on the correct speech bubble.  When they were
   finished, we glued it all down to a piece of construction paper!
   [Picture5.png]
   And Voila!  Easy peasy, lemon squeezy!  The kids loved it & it was
   really a great way to reinforce our learning of the 4 types of
   sentences!
   So, that's a wrap.. Yeah, yeah, I know.  If you'd like a copy of the
   speech bubbles & the mummy template, just click {here}.  I've also
   provided pre-made sentences to cut & paste onto each speech bubble for
   those learners who need some extra assistance.
   Well, that's it for me. As always, thanks for stopping by!  I hope you
   are all having a great week!
