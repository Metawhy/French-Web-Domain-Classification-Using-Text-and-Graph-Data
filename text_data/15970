How To Use Twitter Likes With Ethics

   Posted on September 8, 2016 by webmaster

   On the Internet, so many things can be misinterpreted or misconstrued
   because it lacks the personal touch of a voice or facial expressions to
   accompany what you meant to say. Using social media functions such as
   twitter likes and Facebook emotions can somewhat help you with that.

   Having said that, there is some unspoken rule of thumb when it comes to
   expressing your thoughts and feelings when you’re online. Twitter
   likes, for example, shouldn’t be used to spam every tweet of someone
   you like or adore. Flooding his or her twitter with likes can come
   across as stalk-ish so you may want to choose which tweet you like best
   even though you feel the person writes great things.

   You can use likes to get someone’s attention on twitter, but if you’re
   not too shy, mentioning them would be a better way because most of the
   time, a user don’t check the other user’s account simply because he or
   she liked a tweet. Basically, it’s a good idea to space out the number
   of likes you place on another user’s account.

Use of Social Media Ads To Get Free Likes.

   Posted on September 8, 2016 by webmaster

   The use of pinned social media Ads is the sure way of getting targeted
   free likes to your page. With the benefits that come with them,
   spending some amount to run the ads is not a big deal because there is
   a guaranteed profit in future when the numbers will be converted into
   real sales. The targeted ads are ideal because you get attention from
   most users who were not aware of your page in the first instance. It is
   a technique used to take advantage of friends of your existing
   followers to lure them to like your page since their friend is already
   on that particular page.

   With their friend already on that particular page, they are likely to
   be encouraged to proceed and like it even without reading the content
   posted there or going through the profile. They get convinced just
   because a friend they know is already following. Because of your
   existing followers, you just got more free likes from their friends who
   were not even aware of your current page. It is a sure way of getting
   targeted audience.

Why You Should Avoid Posting Controversial Content To Your Free Followers.

   Posted on September 8, 2016 by webmaster

   The content you are posting on your page determines the rate at which
   you will attract and keep free followers as you seek to build your
   online presence. Every moment counts and you should take advantage of
   it to stay ahead of your competitors. However, be cautious of the
   content you choose to post because it can make or break the reputation
   you have taken the time to build. You can start right but deviate along
   the way because of poor planning and running out of content earlier
   than anticipated.


   Always go for standard debatable topics with little or no controversy
   at all to prevent your existing followers from taking sides and
   unhealthy stands. Always avoid these two subjects; politics and
   religion. It ‘s nice to have conversations and ongoing engagements but
   don’t build on those two topics because in most instances the come to a
   dead end with disagreements. You cannot attract a diverse niche of free
   followers if you build on such topics. Any shared content causing
   friction or a discomfort to certain sections should be avoided.

4 Twitter Rules that attract more Likes you should know about

   Posted on August 31, 2016 by webmaster

   For most people, building a twitter account to attract more than 100
   followers was about trial and error. It was about watching and learning
   what gets popular people many twitter likes with their posts.
   Fortunately for you, here are some rules that can guarantee you more
   attention and followers even though you might not be a popular person.
   To start with, know that the use of hash tags is an art. You don’t just
   pick any of them, and neither can you use too many of them.

   On the other hand, share quality posts, but be consistent at it. Don’t
   bombard your followers with very many tweets, or your twitter likes
   could start to dwindle down soon. If you are a company on the other
   hand, always use the first person plural. And note, don’t push your
   brand to the people. First entertain and inform them, ask them to buy
   your products later. When it comes to engagement with your twitter
   panel, answer their queries as soon as you can, and also ensure that
   you appreciate those who share and like your posts.
