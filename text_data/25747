Green Hotspots in New York City

   Urban Jungle Bloggers in NYC #urbanjunglebloggers #hotspot #nyc Ok
   let‚Äôs be frank: New York is always worth a trip! No matter your
   interests, your likings, your plans. The city that never sleeps offers
   it all ‚Äì for everybody. So if you are a plant freak like us, you will
   enjoy the city to the max too. Just like we did a few weeks ago when we
   went to New York City for an exciting upcoming plant project (stay
   tuned). We snapped away with our smartphones and brought back some of
   our favorite green tips for New York ‚Äì bookmark these if you plan a
   visit and love plants. Let‚Äôs roll! Let‚Äôs first start with some plant
   shopping. It‚Äôs very easy to find some nice plants in the Big Apple! You
   can go to the Chelsea Flower Market, or visit one of the cool urban
   plant shops in town. Our list was long and between meetings‚Ä¶

Sleeping with Plants

   Every time we post a picture on Instagram of a beautiful bedroom filled
   with plants, we get some concerned comments from people that believe
   sleeping in a bedroom with plants is not healthy. We don‚Äôt agree with
   them and here is why: plants respire as humans do, emitting carbon
   dioxide at night as a reverse response to photosynthesis and
   converting carbon dioxide to oxygen during the day. Carbon dioxide and
   carbon monoxide are often confused. The names sound the same, they both
   are colorless and odorless gases, and at high concentrations, both can
   be deadly. In small amounts carbon dioxide is relatively harmless,
   while carbon monoxide is extremely dangerous. Maybe that‚Äôs where the
   confusion arises? Good to know, is that the amount of CO2 most plants
   produce at night is far less than humans and pets do. You could even
   say that sleeping with someone, in the same room or bed‚Ä¶

Urban Jungle Book Launch in Paris

   Almost one year after we launched our Urban Jungle book in English and
   German in the Botanical Garden in Munich, we were very happy to finally
   present our book in French! In the past months we received so many
   messages from French speaking plant lovers asking for our book in
   French, that we‚Äôre delighted that it‚Äôs finally here! We worked with the
   team of Editions Eyrolles to translate our book into French and make
   sure it would look pixel perfect. They did an excellent job and holding
   our book en fran√ßais (and seeing it in French bookshops!) really makes
   our heart skip a beat. As you know, we both have a very special bond
   with France üòâ Last Thursday we presented our book to French press and
   bloggers at the perfect Urban Jungle Bloggers location: Mama Petula, a
   botanical concept store in the 14th arrondissement in Paris. It‚Äôs a

A plantshelfie with the FENCY from Tolhuijs

   13 December 201623 December 2016

   Urban Jungle Bloggers - Fency Tolhuijs plantshelfie

   It‚Äôs one of our favorite plant styling ideas: the plantshelfie. The
   plantshelfie is a real Urban Jungle Bloggers classic and has been the
   monthly topic not once, but even twice before. Bloggers from all over
   the world joined in and styled their shelfie with plants in their own
   specific way. From a simple ledge, to a String shelfie or a bookcase:
   the fun of a nice plantshelfie lays in the unlimited styling
   opportunities. Personal photos, travel souvenirs, art, trinkets,
   sculptures, gems, decor objects‚Ä¶ and at least one plant.

   Urban Jungle Bloggers - Fency Tolhuijs plantshelfie

   Recently we were approached by Tolhuijs Design because they wanted to
   introduce us to their latest design: the FENCY. Before watching into
   the details, we thought: plantshelfie! But the FENCY is more than just
   a shelf system:  it is a design object with a story: all materials from
   the grid structure and the wooden shelves are so called: waste
   upgrading. The grid structure is made of sturdy festival fences. They
   are upcycled: cleaned, stripped, cut into the right dimensions,
   polished and powder coated in white, black or a beautiful mint green
   Urban Jungle Bloggers colour. All of this work isn‚Äôt done by regular
   carpenters but by people in prisons and social work places. Working
   helps to give these people a purpose and responsibility in their daily
   lives which contributes to a better society. FENCY is social
   responsible!

   Urban Jungle Bloggers - Fency Tolhuijs plantshelfie

   The wooden shelves of the FENCY are made from pressed wooden pallets
   and can be attached to the grid with 2 simple hooks. These allow you to
   place them exactly where you like them: on top, a bit more to the left
   or to the right. Very versatile and so much fun to play around with!
   And if your plants (or your collection of props) grow bigger, simply
   adjust the position of the shelves.

   Urban Jungle Bloggers - Fency Tolhuijs plantshelfie

   Another cool idea would be to use parts of the FENCY as a trellis for
   crawling or climbing plants, like Devil‚Äôs ivy (pothos), Hedera (ivy),
   and Passiflora.

   Urban Jungle Bloggers - Fency Tolhuijs plantshelfie

   The FENCY comes in different shapes and sizes: it is a cool wall
   structure to organize kitchen utensils or to keep your work tools at
   hand in the home office. Use it to display your favorite clothes in
   your bedroom or artwork in the living room. We couldn‚Äôt help ourselves
   and turned it into a plant display and included our Urban Jungle book:

   Urban Jungle Bloggers - Fency Tolhuijs plantshelfie

   Single, double, triple or quatro shelves from pressed wooden pallets
   can be used to display a group or one singular plant, like the Alo√´
   below:

   We have a little bonus for you, if you wish to order your own FENCY:
   until December 19th 2016 you get 25% off if you use the code
   ‚Äúurbanjungleblog‚Äù. Go ahead, get yourself a FENCY and happy plant
   styling!
