Mt. Everest has around 200 dead bodies (pics)

     Mt. Everest has around 200 dead bodies on the mountain. It is nearly
     impossible for recovery of a body off the mountain. Most of the
     bodies are in the same exact position they were when they died.
     Perfectly preserved in time because of the cold. Along the route up
     to the summit climbers will pass all these bodies. There are bodies
     over 50 years old that look like they were placed there yesterday.
     The "death zone" is 26,000 feet. Air is so thin that there is no
     margin for error. Immediate frostbite will happen. Lack of oxygen
     leaves climber bewildered and weak. Cost for one to go on a trip is
     $25,000.
     Several bodies are given names. This one is "green boots". Many of
     the bodies are now landmarks along the way up. "green Boots" has
     been there since 1996.
     �PLEASE don�t leave me,� the dying woman cried.
     There was an American flag placed on this woman years later and a
     note from her family. Two people found the woman alone and barely
     alive but could do nothing to help her. They thought about that
     moment everyday and saved up all their money for 8 years to make a
     return trip and give her a proper "burial".
     Here's one of George Mallory where he has lain since falling to his
     death in 1924
     Bodies lay exactly where the climber last took a "rest". Most of the
     time they take a rest and dont wake up.

     I imagine K2 is just as bad. The stats regarding the number of
     people that begin an ascent and don't make it back are ridiculous.

     WINTER IS COMING
     Next meet: October?
     Squat - 350 (Goal: 405) - Bench - 245 (Goal: 260) - Deadlift - 500
     (Goal: 550) - OHP - 175 (Goal: 185) Total: 1085 (Goal: 1200)

     I think they all know the consequences when they decide to go up

     No, not mad.

     I think if they are above the "dead zone" they are preserved very

     I really really want to see what Gregory Mallory's face looks like,
     him being from 1924 and all just blows my mind.

     For those interested check out the book Into Thin Air by Jon
     Krakauer. True story of an expidition he went on in the 90's to
     climb Everest and several seasoned climbers were lost. One of the
     best books ever.

     im not wealthy enough to afford a climb and i probably never will be
     feelsbadman.
     $25k for climb
     $60k for sherpas
     I read on a website you need to obtain some expensive pass before
     they even let you climb.

     Yep i can remember watching this on national geographic, there was
     some lady who was dieing, and everyone just walks past her while she
