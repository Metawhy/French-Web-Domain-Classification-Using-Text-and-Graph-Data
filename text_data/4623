   Car Talk uses Discourse as a forum for their thousands of loyal
   listeners and readers. We dare you to come up with a question about
   cars that can not be answered on their forum of experts & avid
   hobbyists.

   Discourse is flat out amazing. It’s powerful, reliable, and flexible.
   We transitioned from another provider a year ago and never looked back.
   We’ve only just started to tap into its versatility. And— oh, the best
   part? They're great folks who are smart and listen to our needs. (Thank
   you, Jeff and Neil!)

   Frostbite is a game engine originally developed by EA DICE for its
   Battlefield series. Frostbite uses Discourse as a private forum to
   discuss company-specific internal technologies and toolsets.

   Traditionally, most of our communication has been done via mailing
   lists, but as our community has grown over the past few years the
   mailing list model has increasingly become a hurdle for us for many
   types of communication, for a variety of reasons. This topic on Meta
   gives a nice overview of why a particular sub-community inside
   Frostbite really prefers Discourse over mailing lists.

   Western Digital uses Discourse as a public support forum for their
   product line.

   (...) The more we get to know the Discourse platform, the more we fall
   in love with it. It’s simple and intuitive, but much more powerful than
   you imagine. We don’t know how many times we got lost cruising around
   checking out all the features. And, as a plus, we really enjoy working
   with the Discourse team.

   Code School uses Discourse as a commenting platform for all of their
   courses, helping learners easily get in touch with their peers and
   mentors.

   Discourse is used by Code School users' when they have questions about
   courses and coding challenges. We're not a games company, but we do try
   to gamify the coding learning experience to make it more enjoyable and
   sticky. A lot of our users still reach out to Support when they have
   questions about code, but we try to push them to ask the forum for help
   with those kind of things.

   CCP Games uses Discourse for EVE Online. There, EVE gamers can follow

   Excellent API support, comfortable to manage, extendable through
   plugins and very easy in use
