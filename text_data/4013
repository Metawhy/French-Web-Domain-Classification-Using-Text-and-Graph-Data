Multi-Select & Bulk Editing

   Multi-Select is amazing. With Divi, you can press Cmd or Ctrl and click
   to select multiple elements on the page at once. You can then edit
   these elements at the same time, changing their style and content
   together or moving them to different locations on the page as a group.
   Learn More Play Video

Find & Replace Styles

   Make sweeping changes across your entire page instantly, saving you
   hours upon hours of editing time. Using find and replace allows you to
   change any design value, such as colors or fonts, across the entire
   page or within specific locations. Instead of opening up each element
   individually and changing colors over and over again, just find and
   replace across the entire document. It's incredible.
   Learn More Play Video

Magic Color Manager

   Divi automatically remembers your recently used colors and stores them
   for easy access. It also displays your own customizable color pallet.
   In addition, Divi creates a unique extended color pallet using advanced
   color theory to give you a range of suggested colors that will look
   great on your page.
   Learn More Play Video

Copy & Paste Styles

   The ability to copy and paste styles across elements is an absolute
   game changer. In Divi, anything can be copied from one element and
   pasted onto another. You can copy individual settings, groups of
   settings or even copy an element's entire design and transfer it to
   another element on the page. No need to open up design settings and
   edit things over and over again. Just copy and paste.
   Learn More Play Video

Extend-able Styles

   Divi's extend styles functionality brings design efficiency to a whole
   new level. If you have a design style that you just created, and you
   want to use that elsewhere on the page, or even across the entire page,
   you can simply extend that style automatically to your desired
   location. Update hundreds of elements at once! Control exactly where
   and to which elements your styles should be extended to. For example,
   let's say you just crafted the perfect box shadow and border style for
   your images, but you have dozens of images on the page. You can extend
   that style to the rest of your images instantly!

Divi Quick Actions

   The Divi quick action system is an all-in-one finder and doer. Need
   help finding a setting? Looking for some clarification on how something
   works in the builder? Just type to search through our help videos and
   all available Divi options. Perform advanced actions like adding
   elements or loading layouts. Quickly jump to different parts of the
   builder with a few keystrokes, or even jump to different pages and
   different WordPress admin areas. It's super fast and a huge time saver.

   instantly and appear inside your design! Drag and drop entire Divi
   layouts to import them directly. Drag in new web fonts, text files,

Keyboard Shortcuts

   Keyboard shorcuts are the key to ultimate efficiency. Divi comes with a

   up their work flow significantly. Once you get the hang of using
   shortcuts, you will wonder how you ever lived without them!

   Divi Keyboard Shortcuts

Quick Access To Element Styling

   Divi elements come with a huge array of design settings. However, Divi
   also makes it easy to search and filter through these settings and to
   quickly jump to your already-modified settings. Viewing modified styles
   gives you a list of all settings that are currently active so that you
   don't have to hunt through the full array of options. It's very similar
   to Google Chrome's "view computer styles" filter.
   Learn More Play Video

Search-able Settings

   All Divi settings are search-able. Instead of hunting through different
   options groups to find the particular option you are looking for, you
   can just start typing when you open a settings pop-up and the results
   will be filtered accordingly. Even if you know where to find an option,
   searching for it is faster. No need to click into different tabs and
   groups. If you want to edit your background color just type "background
   color" and the option will appear right away.
   Learn More Play Video

Filterable Settings & Search

   Settings within Divi are also filterable. Applying different search
   filters will trim down the results and help you find what you are
   looking for. Search results can be filtered to organize settings into
   different groups such as modified styles, responsive styles, and hover
   styles.

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

     “When Divi came out, it was a game-changer for me. It allowed me to
     become familiar with one theme and learn how to do anything I could
     possibly think of with that one theme. Divi has allowed me to be the
     freelancer I always wanted to be. Now my entire business is shaped
     around being a Divi designer.”

   "Our firm has used Divi as the base framework for over 40 client
   websites and we continue to use Divi on a regular basis due to the
   amazing flexibility that Divi provides our clients. As a web design
   firm we (Valorous Circle) can work with most any theme or design; we
   work with Divi because it saves us time and that translates into
   savings for our clients. Our clients love Divi because they have the
   ability to create amazing web page layouts using the Divi Page Builder
   without needing to understand the complexities of CSS, HTML or PHP. All
   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."
   Loretta Gale

   "We started our Small Business Initiative program to help Small
   Businesses get online in August 2013. When Divi was released in
   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."
   Andrew Palmer

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 10 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

Perfect in product and support

   The Themes Divi and Extra are really professional and easy to use. But
   simply the best is the support. Always friendly, highest quality
   solutions and fast in requests. Perfect to work with. Thanks.

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

     “When Divi came out, it was a game-changer for me. It allowed me to
     become familiar with one theme and learn how to do anything I could
     possibly think of with that one theme. Divi has allowed me to be the
     freelancer I always wanted to be. Now my entire business is shaped
     around being a Divi designer.”

   "Our firm has used Divi as the base framework for over 40 client
   websites and we continue to use Divi on a regular basis due to the
   amazing flexibility that Divi provides our clients. As a web design
   firm we (Valorous Circle) can work with most any theme or design; we
   work with Divi because it saves us time and that translates into
   savings for our clients. Our clients love Divi because they have the
   ability to create amazing web page layouts using the Divi Page Builder
   without needing to understand the complexities of CSS, HTML or PHP. All
   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."

   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."
   Andrew Palmer

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 11 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.

Multi-Select & Bulk Editing

   Multi-Select is amazing. With Divi, you can press Cmd or Ctrl and click
   to select multiple elements on the page at once. You can then edit
   these elements at the same time, changing their style and content
   together or moving them to different locations on the page as a group.
   Learn More Play Video

Find & Replace Styles

   Make sweeping changes across your entire page instantly, saving you
   hours upon hours of editing time. Using find and replace allows you to
   change any design value, such as colors or fonts, across the entire
   page or within specific locations. Instead of opening up each element
   individually and changing colors over and over again, just find and
   replace across the entire document. It's incredible.
   Learn More Play Video

Magic Color Manager

   Divi automatically remembers your recently used colors and stores them
   for easy access. It also displays your own customizable color pallet.
   In addition, Divi creates a unique extended color pallet using advanced
   color theory to give you a range of suggested colors that will look
   great on your page.
   Learn More Play Video

Copy & Paste Styles

   The ability to copy and paste styles across elements is an absolute
   game changer. In Divi, anything can be copied from one element and
   pasted onto another. You can copy individual settings, groups of
   settings or even copy an element's entire design and transfer it to
   another element on the page. No need to open up design settings and
   edit things over and over again. Just copy and paste.
   Learn More Play Video

Extend-able Styles

   Divi's extend styles functionality brings design efficiency to a whole
   new level. If you have a design style that you just created, and you
   want to use that elsewhere on the page, or even across the entire page,
   you can simply extend that style automatically to your desired
   location. Update hundreds of elements at once! Control exactly where
   and to which elements your styles should be extended to. For example,
   let's say you just crafted the perfect box shadow and border style for
   your images, but you have dozens of images on the page. You can extend
   that style to the rest of your images instantly!

Divi Quick Actions

   The Divi quick action system is an all-in-one finder and doer. Need
   help finding a setting? Looking for some clarification on how something
   works in the builder? Just type to search through our help videos and
   all available Divi options. Perform advanced actions like adding
   elements or loading layouts. Quickly jump to different parts of the
   builder with a few keystrokes, or even jump to different pages and
   different WordPress admin areas. It's super fast and a huge time saver.

   shortcuts, you will wonder how you ever lived without them!

Quick Access To Element Styling

   Divi elements come with a huge array of design settings. However, Divi
   also makes it easy to search and filter through these settings and to
   quickly jump to your already-modified settings. Viewing modified styles
   gives you a list of all settings that are currently active so that you
   don't have to hunt through the full array of options. It's very similar
   to Google Chrome's "view computer styles" filter.
   Learn More Play Video

Search-able Settings

   All Divi settings are search-able. Instead of hunting through different
   options groups to find the particular option you are looking for, you
   can just start typing when you open a settings pop-up and the results
   will be filtered accordingly. Even if you know where to find an option,
   searching for it is faster. No need to click into different tabs and
   groups. If you want to edit your background color just type "background
   color" and the option will appear right away.
   Learn More Play Video

Filterable Settings & Search

   Settings within Divi are also filterable. Applying different search
   filters will trim down the results and help you find what you are
   looking for. Search results can be filtered to organize settings into
   different groups such as modified styles, responsive styles, and hover
   styles.

The best support I have ever had

   The best support I have ever had. Very quick to respond, usually in a
   couple of hours and always get a fix within a few attempts. Would
   recommend them highly.

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."

   "We started our Small Business Initiative program to help Small
   Businesses get online in August 2013. When Divi was released in
   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 10 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

I love the new support method

   makes it much easier to get support and speeds up time to get issues
   sorted. Thank you...Shows the value of experience on Support side and
   the value of going with a company that constantly develop, improve and

Perfect in product and support

   The Themes Divi and Extra are really professional and easy to use. But
   simply the best is the support. Always friendly, highest quality
   solutions and fast in requests. Perfect to work with. Thanks.

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

     “When Divi came out, it was a game-changer for me. It allowed me to
     become familiar with one theme and learn how to do anything I could
     possibly think of with that one theme. Divi has allowed me to be the
     freelancer I always wanted to be. Now my entire business is shaped
     around being a Divi designer.”

   "Our firm has used Divi as the base framework for over 40 client
   websites and we continue to use Divi on a regular basis due to the
   amazing flexibility that Divi provides our clients. As a web design
   firm we (Valorous Circle) can work with most any theme or design; we
   work with Divi because it saves us time and that translates into
   savings for our clients. Our clients love Divi because they have the
   ability to create amazing web page layouts using the Divi Page Builder
   without needing to understand the complexities of CSS, HTML or PHP. All
   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."
   Loretta Gale

   "We started our Small Business Initiative program to help Small
   Businesses get online in August 2013. When Divi was released in
   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."
   Andrew Palmer

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 11 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.

The best support I have ever had

   The best support I have ever had. Very quick to respond, usually in a
   couple of hours and always get a fix within a few attempts. Would
   recommend them highly.

Rock star support for a great product!

   Love Divi, and more importantly, love their support. They are
   constantly improving their product and always ready to assist. Rock
   stars!

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

Bloom

eMail Opt-In And Lead Generation Plugin For WordPress

   Live Demo

Grow Your Following!

Gain More Email Subscribers with BLOOM, an Email Opt-In Plugin for WordPress.

   Premade Layouts

Convert

Convert Visitors Into Loyal Followers

   Bloom gives you all the tools you need to turn your website's visitors
   into loyal followers and customers. Not only is Bloom going to convert
   extremely well, it's going to look great doing it.
   More Email Subscribers

More Email Subscribers

   Email marketing is extremely powerful. In fact, we see 20X the
   engagement from emails than we do from posts to our social media
   profiles.
   Targeted Content

Highly Targeted Content

   Bloom lets you target or exclude specific posts and pages and display
   unique forms with unique offers based on visitor location and
   interaction.
   Design Options

Elegant Design Options

   We have built over 100 amazing templates, each of which can be
   completely customized using Bloom's extensive design settings.

Display

Pick From 6 Different Display Types

Automatic Opt-In Pop-Up

   Bloom lets you create automatic opt-in pop-ups that can be triggered by
   timed delays, when a user reaches the bottom of a post or page, or even
   after they comment or purchase. This is an extremely effective way to
   generate and convert leads.
   Live Preview
   Automatic Opt-In Pop-Up

Automatic Opt-In Fly-Ins

   Similar to triggered pop-ups, fly-ins are another great way to grab
   your readers' attention. Again, these can be triggered by user
   interaction such as timed delays or at the end of a page.
   Live Preview
   Automatic Opt-In Fly-In

In-line Opt-In Forms

   Sometimes there is need for a more location specific approach than you
   can get with a global pop-up or fly-in. That's where inline opt-in
   forms come in. Simply configure your form, generate its shortcode, and
   place it inside the WordPress post editor.
   Live Preview
   Inline Opt-In Form

Below Content Opt-In Forms

   Perfect for blog posts and content heavy pages, Bloom allows you to
   automatically place opt-in forms below your post or page content,
   capturing the attention of your most engaged readers without upsetting
   their reading experience.
   Live Preview
   Below Content Opt-In Form

Widget Area Opt-In Forms

   Sidebars and footers are great places to add an opt-in box. Bloom makes
   it easy to add opt-ins to any widget-ready area using the Bloom widget.
   Create as many widgets as you like and add them to any widget-ready
   area on your website.
   Learn More
   Widget Area Opt-In Form

Require Opt-In To Unlock Content

   Requiring users to subscribe to your lists before gaining access to
   premium content is a great way to increase your subscriber count. Bloom
   can act as a pay-wall between your free resources and your visitors,
   quickly turning traffic into loyal followers.
   Live Preview
   Opt-In to Unlock Content

Trigger!

Automatic Pop-Up & Fly-In Triggers

   Not only do different websites, pages, and posts have different opt-in
   form needs, but sometimes you also want to direct specific forms and
   offers based on specific user interaction. The triggers below allow you
   to add this extra level of specificity to hone in on your audience and
   gain even higher conversion rates.

Timed Delay

   Choose a timed delay for your pop-ups and fly-ins so that they trigger
   after your readers have been on a page for a specific duration of time.

Bottom of Post

   Let Bloom auto detect when your readers reach the bottom of a post or
   page and give your readers a friendly reminder to opt-in.

After Scrolling

   Use this trigger to display your opt-in forms only after visitors
   scroll a defined percentage of the way down your page.

After Commenting

   Displaying opt-in forms to readers after commenting on a post or page
   is a sure way to target visitors who are clearly engaged with your
   content.

After Purchasing

   Offer updates on future products and promotions by triggering an opt-in
   form for purchasing visitors right after the checkout process.

After Inactivity

   If a user is inactive on your page for too long, Bloom can be triggered
   to re-catch your visitor's attention with a pop-up or fly-in.

Integrate

19 Email Marketing Integrations

   Bloom gives you the power to display opt-in forms using integrations of
   the most popular email marketing systems available. Bloom seamlessly
   obtains information about all of your lists and subscriber counts.
   Bloom Email Marketing Integrations

Design & Customize

Start From Any of 100+ Pre-made Templates Or Customize Your Own!

   Well-designed opt-in forms that look like they belong specifically to
   your website are key to creating trust. Bloom comes with a ton of
   different design settings, allowing you to adjust just about every
   aspect of your opt-in form.

   Targeted Display

Select from 3 Opt-In Form Orientations

   Depending on your opt-in's location and type, you may want to place
   your form below or on the side of your opt-in. Bloom gives you 3
   orientations to choose from: bottom, left, or right.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Customized Borders & Edges

   Select from Bloom's different border styles and choose which edges to
   apply them too. You can also define an edge style that separates your
   opt-in's content from its form fields.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Image Orientation Options

   You can add any image to your opt-in while also having the options to
   display it to the left, the right, above or below your opt-in's text
   content.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Unlimited Color Options

   In addition to border, edge, form field, and text content options, you
   also have full control over the colors that define these elements.
   Enjoy unlimited color options for all the elements within your opt-in
   forms.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Fully Responsive

   We know that your opt-in forms need to be readable and accessible from
   all devices, allowing visitors to opt-in no matter how they are viewing
   your site. Blooms opt-in forms and dashboard are fully responsive and
   look great all the way down to even the smallest mobile devices and
   highest resolution screens.
   Responsive Design

Target

Highly Targeted Display Settings

   Display settings are used to control where on your website your opt-in
   will appear, as well as when it will appear. You can choose to display
   your opt-in on your entire site, or you can choose to display you
   opt-in on individual posts or post types. Create unlimited opt-in forms
   and tailor them to specific pages and specific visitors to increase
   your conversion rates.

   Targeted Display

Automatic Fly-In and Pop-Up Triggers

   If you are creating a pop-up or fly-in you need to have full control
   over what triggers this automation. Bloom lets you trigger your opt-ins
   based on a timed delay, at the bottom of a post or page, after
   scrolling, after commenting, after purchasing, and/or after the user is
   inactive on your page for a defined amount of time.
   Optin Triggers

Target Specific Post Types and Categories

   Bloom's display settings give you global options for displaying your
   opt-in on selected post and page types, along with specific categories
   within them.
   Display Targeting

Refine on a Per Post or Page Level

   For an extra level of display targeting, you can even specify specific
   pages and posts to either display or not display an opt-in on.
   Display Targeting

Manage

The Bloom Dashboard

   Setting up and managing your Bloom settings is anything but
   complicated. We've created a custom panel in the WordPress dashboard
   for easy and intuitive access to your Bloom accounts, lists, opt-ins,
   conversion rates, and data.
   Bloom Dashboard

Increase Conversions With A/B Testing

   Split testing lets you compare the performance of multiple variations
   of the same opt-in form to help you figure out which one is the most
   effective. These different variations will be shown to different
   visitors, and their conversion rates will be compared to each other so
   you can see which one is the highest performing variation.
   Slplit Testing

Add, Modify, and Track Accounts

   You can add an unlimited number of email marketing accounts and Bloom
   will organize your accounts by provider and also aggregate the lists
   and subscriber counts that are associated with those accounts. When you
   are building opt-in forms you can then choose from any of these lists,
   or even setup an account on the fly.
   Email Optin Account Management

Conversion and Email List Statistics

   It is almost impossible to refine and improve the way you are targeting
   your visitors without actionable insights around when, where, and how
   your opt-ins are converting the best. That's why we've created a robust
   statistics dashboard to give you a real-time overview of Bloom's
   performance.
   Social Sharing and Following Statistics

Import and Export Bloom Data

   Bloom lets you easily import and export its data from one site to
   another. In addition to migration, this is also a great way to backup
   your Bloom settings and data on a regular basis.

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

Social Sharing

Over 20 Social Networks to Choose From

   Social Media is the lifeblood that keeps the internet glowing. Social
   Sharing lets you harness that activity and use it as a positive force
   for your business. Choose from more than 20 social sharing networks to
   display on your website to create a custom collection of sharing
   options for your visitors.
   Monarch Sharing Networks

Add Sharing Buttons in 5 Different Locations

   Different websites, pages, and posts have different social sharing
   needs. That's why we've included a large selection of locations you can
   choose to place sharing buttons.

Floating Sidebar

   A floating sidebar is a very common, effective, and sleek way to add
   social sharing icons to any page on your website. We've even included
   unique hover styles for the vertical and browser edge orientation of a
   social sidebar.
   Live Preview
   Floating Sidebar Share Icons

Above & or Below Content

   Perfect for blog posts and content heavy pages, Monarch allows you to
   place sharing buttons either above the content area, below the content
   area, or in both locations.
   Live Preview
   Inline Share Icons

On Images & Videos

   Media is arguably the most shared content on the web and Monarch makes
   media sharing even easier. When users hover over media elements within
   your content social sharing buttons fade in for quick and easy sharing.
   Live Preview
   Media Share Icons

Automatic Pop-Ups

   Monarch lets you create automatic sharing pop-ups that can be triggered
   by timed delays, such as when a user reaches the bottom of a post or
   page and even upon leaving a page. These are incredibly effective.
   Live Preview
   Popup Share Icons

Automatic Fly-ins

   Similar to triggered pop-ups, fly-ins are another great way to grab
   your readers' attention when they are most engaged. These can also be
   triggered by time delays, page location, or when the user's mouse is
   leaving the page.
   Live Preview
   Flyin Share Icons

Pop & Fly!

6 Automatic Pop-Up & Fly-In Triggers

   Pop-ups and Fly-ins can be triggered by unique user interactions. This
   allows you to capture your visitors' attention when they are most
   engaged or when they are in danger of leaving your page.

Timed Delay

   Choose a timed delay for your pop-ups and fly-ins so that they trigger
   after your readers have been on a page for a specific duration of time.

Bottom of Post

   Let Monarch auto detect when your readers reach the bottom of a post or
   page and give your readers a friendly reminder to opt-in.

After Commenting

   Displaying opt-in forms to readers after commenting on a post or page
   is a sure way to target visitors who are clearly engaged with your
   content.

Upon % Scroll

   Use this trigger to display your opt-in forms only after a visitor
   scrolls a defined percentage of the way down your page.

After Purchasing

   Offer updates on future products and promotions by triggering an opt-in
   form for purchasing visitors right after the checkout process.

After Inactivity

   If a user is inactive on your page for too long, Bloom can be triggered
   to re-catch your visitor's attention with a pop-up or fly-in.

Display

Build & Display Your Social Following

   Letting your users see your social networks profiles, follow counts,
   and easily become a follower is more than important for any business or
   individual. Monarch makes all of the above possible with just a few
   easy settings.

Over 35 Social Networks to Choose From

   Monarch lets you choose from over 30 social profiles and networks. Just
   supply your profile URL's and Monarch will display the network icons
   and even dynamically pull your existing follow counts if desired.
   Monarch Follow Networks

Place Follow Buttons in any Widget Area or Display With a Shortcode

   Displaying social follow links within your content is as simple as
   generating and pasting a shortcode within your content. Placing this
   shortcode inside of a Divi Text Module is a perfect way to take
   advantage of this feature.
   Monarch Follow Display Areas

Clean, Customizable Design

   We know that implementing plugin elements into your site can appear
   tacky and out of place, so we packed Monarch full of design options for
   seamless design integration.

Choose Button Shapes, Colors, & Hover Effects

   Monarch offers 3 button shapes, 5 sidebar button hover effects, and 4
   inline button hover effects. Combining these appearance options allows
   you to fit your social icons perfectly into the design of your theme.

Display Network Names & Social Counts

   For a more robust social link, you can display the network names and or
   the individual or total share or follow counts. No matter what
   information you choose to display, your social links will look great.

Pick Your Icon Orientation

   Being able to display the social network icon above or to the left of
   your share counts, follow counts and/or network name doubles the design
   opportunities available to you. Whether you are displaying your icons
   in a more vertical or horizontal orientation, this option lets you take
   advantage of the space.

Use Native Network Colors or Pick Your Own!

   By default, the button colors will be that of the native colors of each
   social network. For a more custom appearance, you can pick custom
   colors for the button and icon colors for both before and on hover.

Mobile Friendly

   We know that your opt-in forms need to be readable and accessible from
   all devices, allowing visitors to opt-in no matter how they are viewing
   your site. Monarch's opt-in forms and dashboard are fully responsive
   and look great all the way down to even the smallest mobile devices and
   highest resolution screens.

Manage

The Monarch Dashboard

   Setting up and managing your Monarch settings is anything but
   complicated. We've created a custom panel in the WordPress dashboard
   for easy and intuitive access to your Monarch settings, stats, and
   data.

Configure All of Your Display Settings

   In addition to basic appearance options Monarch also lets you refine
   your display settings to fit your every need. Lazy loading animations,
   share count display minimums, and column structures are just a few of
   the things you can control.

Check Your Statistics

   An overview of your Monarch statistics can be accessed at any time via
   the dashboard. Just click the stats icon in the upper right for
   statistics around your shares, follows, and likes.

Import and Export Monarch Data

   If you have multiple websites that you want to display similar Monarch
   configurations on, you can quickly and easily import and export Monarch
   settings from one WordPress site to another.

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

Perfect in product and support

   The Themes Divi and Extra are really professional and easy to use. But

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:
