Couverture Site Booster

   Pour booster la réception 3G+/4G dans vos locaux.

   installer, cette solution permet à vos collaborateurs de retrouver tout
   le confort du réseau 3G+ et 4G d'Orange sur votre site.

Couverture Site Express

   Couverture Site Express vous fait bénéficier d'une couverture mobile
   dans vos locaux, y compris dans les endroits difficiles (sous-sols,
   hangars, pièces aveugles, ...). Un boîtier femtocell agit comme une
   mini antenne : vos utilisateurs peuvent téléphoner et échanger des
   données. Compatible terminaux 3G/3G+, simple à installer.

Couverture Site Confort

   Une couverture 3G+ de qualité dans vos locaux.

   Couverture Site Confort propose jusqu’à 12 cellules femtocell 3G+ pour
   couvrir vos équipements mobiles dans vos locaux. Vos collaborateurs
   peuvent téléphoner et accéder à Internet en toute liberté, y compris
   les lieux mal couverts. Compatible avec une flotte 3G+ ou 4G, dans la
   limite de 500 terminaux, jusqu’à 10 niveaux et jusqu'à 10.000m².

Couverture Site sur mesure

   Une couverture 100% adaptée à vos besoins.

   Orange Business Services vous propose une solution sur mesure,
   répondant à vos besoins spécifiques, pour assurer la meilleure
   couverture indoor (3G+, 4G mono et multi opérateurs) quelle que soit la
   topologie de votre site : tour, campus ou site industriel.

     * tous vos appels sont facturés à l’identique La facturation des
       appels est à la minute et identique à celle des communications
       passées sur le réseau cellulaire (2G/3G). Le décompte dépend de
       votre plan tarifaire voix et ne distingue pas les communications
       passées depuis le réseau cellulaire ou depuis le réseau Wifi.

   Booster, Express, Confort ou sur mesure.

Couverture Site Booster

   Pour booster la réception 3G+/4G dans vos locaux.

   installer, cette solution permet à vos collaborateurs de retrouver tout
   le confort du réseau 3G+ et 4G d'Orange sur votre site.

Couverture Site Express

   Une meilleure couverture 3G+ jusqu'à 60 utilisateurs

   Couverture Site Express vous fait bénéficier d'une couverture mobile
   dans vos locaux, y compris dans les endroits difficiles (sous-sols,
   hangars, pièces aveugles, ...). Un boîtier femtocell agit comme une
   mini antenne : vos utilisateurs peuvent téléphoner et échanger des
   données. Compatible terminaux 3G/3G+, simple à installer.

Couverture Site Confort

   Une couverture 3G+ de qualité dans vos locaux.

   Couverture Site Confort propose jusqu’à 12 cellules femtocell 3G+ pour
   couvrir vos équipements mobiles dans vos locaux. Vos collaborateurs
   peuvent téléphoner et accéder à Internet en toute liberté, y compris
   les lieux mal couverts. Compatible avec une flotte 3G+ ou 4G, dans la
   limite de 500 terminaux, jusqu’à 10 niveaux et jusqu'à 10.000m².

Couverture Site sur mesure

   Orange Business Services vous propose une solution sur mesure,
   répondant à vos besoins spécifiques, pour assurer la meilleure
   couverture indoor (3G+, 4G mono et multi opérateurs) quelle que soit la
   topologie de votre site : tour, campus ou site industriel.

       appels est à la minute et identique à celle des communications
       passées sur le réseau cellulaire (2G/3G). Le décompte dépend de

       passées depuis le réseau cellulaire ou depuis le réseau Wifi.

Manage your cloud deployment


   Dynamic business models require flexibility across your organization
   IT teams need to work with many different business functions to develop
   new customer insight and innovative interaction channels. Service
   diversification and profitable growth objectives require new cloud
   computing services to be added and, for those that are outdated, to be
   removed with ease. While the ability to scale capacity on demand is
   essential for geographic expansion.

   Down times and data loss have a significant impact on your business
   Achieving high levels of cloud application availability and
   performance, combined with the need for access anywhere, is a
   significant challenge. Traditional IT security defenses are becoming
   less effective, increasing your chances of being hacked. Data privacy
   regulations are becoming more onerous, adding a further level of
   intricacy.

   Managing the lifecycle of heterogeneous IT landscapes is getting more
   complex
   CIOs need to overcome higher regulatory, security and operational
   hurdles to move IT workloads to the cloud. Employee productivity and
   customer experience are both heavily impacted by data silos between
   business applications and functions. Secure mobile access to cloud
   applications for employees and customers on the move is now an
   expectation.

   Digital transformation can be a real challenge, especially when it
   comes to security. And a multifaceted and fragmented technological
   landscape increases the challenge of keeping your data, intellectual
   property and brand image – your most valuable assets – safe.
   Our security services, powered by Orange Cyberdefense, support you to
   manage risks across the digital life-cycle.

Your environment requires a strong defense line

   Tackle the threats
   Everything valuable must be protected while ensuring availability to
   the organization and third parties as defined by you. Any downtime
   could have a direct impact on revenue and a negative effect on your
   brand image. Detection and reaction to threats in real-time is as
   essential to your organization as your managed security infrastructure.

   Evaluate your options and your choices
   Your growing cloud applications and data must be as secure as your
   on-premise equipment. The diversity of technologies within your
   infrastructure, from mobile to broadband, makes it hard to ensure the
   appropriate levels of security. It’s essential to protect your
   activities from Internet attacks and your internal network at the
   perimeter. Being tied to any one particular vendor or technology can be
   hazardous in the fast-paced environment of security.

   Never forget the human factor
   Security solutions should be user friendly with no impact on anyone’s
   productivity. They should be easy to manage for your IT security
   teams and provide secure access to your corporate resources and cloud
   applications. Your mobile fleet needs protection from the many emerging
   forms of attack that only an advanced detection mobile solution can
   provide.

   The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly simplifying our daily
   lives. It’s also reshaping the way companies are doing business. Like
   the shift to computers and the shift to mobiles, IoT is not just a
   trend, it’s a game changer, boosting efficiency, reducing costs and
   accelerating innovation.
   IoT can provide a wide range of improvements, from ensuring better
   control over production and costs to fostering the development of new
   offers. By enabling more proactive decision making, IoT takes business
   to the next level.

Obtain accurate and timely information about ongoing activities


   You can’t improve what you can’t measure. Getting relevant information
   first hand is the key to understanding the reality of an activity. And
   that can start by selecting the right objects in the field, the ones
   that will provide the data that matters.

   In the case of asset tracking, for instance, IoT enables you to know,
   when required and with fewer errors, where assets are and if they are
   functioning and being used properly. Locating and assessing assets
   manually is lengthy and costly and is no longer the only option.

   Datavenue Device Catalogue
   At Orange, we have extensive experience with devices and data: we

Become more flexible and highly adaptable


   400
   application developers working on over 1,000 software and integration
   projects.

   Business agility is a significant differentiator. Automation powered by
   IoT can make change happen fast, without intervention. And information
   from the field can quickly be made available to business owners for
   timely assessment and decision making.

   A few examples? With location trackers built into products, inventory
   managers are empowered to prevent stock shortages and overstocks and to
   keep tabs on the conditions of goods. With environmental monitoring –
   the remote and timely measuring of pressure, temperature, water, gas
   and electricity, to name a few – quality control is instantly enhanced.

   With our proven expertise in connectivity and specialized platforms, we
   enable our customers to manage their data and objects easily with
   integrated business applications. Every year, our 400 application
   developers work on over 1,000 software and integration projects.

Become more productive and remain cost efficient


   It’s an imperative to which any company can relate. How to do more with
   less is driving most corporate strategies in fast-paced and competitive
   environments. And the leaders of the pack are turning that constraint
   into opportunity.

   How can IoT help? Predictive maintenance is one way. Equipment failures
   require repairs, and unplanned downtime while production lines are
   slowed or stopped cost time and money. IoT can help predict and prevent
   these issues before they happen by monitoring asset status in near real
   time and factoring in historical data to anticipate repairs or
   replacement. The result: less downtime on production lines, lower
   emergency repair costs and better customer experience, which leads to
   better brand perception and real information on how to improve
   next-generation products.

   At Orange Business Services, we help you connect the dots between
   internal processes and customer experience for a real impact on your
   bottom line.
   An effective preventive maintenance program helps deliver savings of as
   much as 12% to 18% on average.

Security and reliability


   1,200
   cyber security experts within Orange Cyberdefense.

   When your business needs enhanced security, IoT can be the answer. For
   example, our geo-fencing service triggers an alert when a device
   crosses a predefined perimeter to prevent theft and misplacement.

   As useful as an IoT solution is, however, it has to be secure and
   reliable to provide results. The data sent by your connected objects
   must make it from the field to the intended recipient safely and
   reliably. And that means choosing the connectivity and security levels
   that are right for your business.

   At Orange Business Services, we know how to connect your objects
   safely, whatever your cost constraints, data volume or coverage needs
   may be. We employ 1,200 cyber security experts within our Orange
   Cyberdefense organization, and we partner with other security
   specialist providers who can add value to our offers.

A wide range of uses


   The possibilities for IoT are as endless as the business requirements:
   predictive maintenance and operations optimization in manufacturing;
   asset tracking in construction; product personalization in consumer
   markets; logistics optimization in travel and transport; energy
   management in utilities; public space security, traffic management,
   street lighting and waste collection in cities; remote patient
   monitoring in healthcare; yield optimization in agriculture; fleet
   management and over-the-air software updates in automotive…and many
   more.
