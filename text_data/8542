Bottom trawling

   Bottom trawling destroys far more ocean habitat than any other fishing
   practice on the West Coast. In this fishing method, large weighted nets
   are dragged across the ocean floor, clear-cutting a swath of habitat in
   their wake. Some of these scars will take centuries to heal, if ever.
   For example, hard corals in Alaska have been dated to be hundreds to
   thousands of years old, and radio carbon dating on the oldest known
   deep sea corals indicates they are 4,200 years in age. Yet, these
   pillars of the ecosystem can be destroyed by one swipe of a bottom
   trawl.

   A bottom trawl consists of a large tapered net with a wide mouth and a
   small enclosed end. The mouth of a trawl net has two weighted doors
   that serve not only to keep the net open, but also to keep the net on
   the ocean floor. These doors can weigh several tons. In addition to the
   heavy doors, the bottom of the net is a thick metal cable (footrope)
   studded with heavy steel balls or rubber bobbins that effectively crush
   everything in their path. As the net drags along the seafloor, living
   habitat in its path is crushed, ripped up, or smothered as the seabed
   is turned over.

   According to the National Academy of Sciences, bottom trawling reduces
   the complexity, productivity, and biodiversity of benthic
   habitats--damage is most severe in areas with corals and sponges. When
   disturbed by bottom trawling, as much as 90 percent of a coral colony
   perishes, and up to two-thirds of sponges are damaged. Additionally, in
   recent coldwater coral studies, a review of damaged areas seven years
   later revealed no new growth. Even in soft sediment habitats, bottom
   trawling can cause irreversible damage.  A study in 2012 entitled
   “Ploughing the deep sea floor” found that bottom trawling fundamentally
   altered the chemistry and geology of soft sediment habitats,
   permanently impacting the biological function and composition of these
   ecosystems.

   The damage from bottom trawling is not limited to habitat destruction.
   As the net drags along the seafloor, all creatures in its path—fish,
   animals, marine mammals, plants, and turtles—are scooped up along the
   way. The fishing vessel keeps the targeted commercial species and
   discards the remaining, unwanted fish and animals—virtually all of it
   dead or dying.

   Once coral and sponge communities are destroyed, commercial fish and
   other species dependent on them for spawning, shelter, nurseries,
   protection, and food, may also disappear. In addition, overfished
   species such as rockfish and crab may need corals and other seafloor
   structures to provide appropriate habitat for recovery.

   Continuing to implement conservation measures is needed and practicable
   to ensure bottom trawling does not destroy coral and sponge habitats.

BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Disaster by the Numbers

   Number 1 largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history.

   11 people were killed in the explosion.

   About 200 million gallons of oil was released into the Gulf of Mexico

   About 2 million gallons of chemical dispersants were used as part of
   the response effort.

   Oil flowed into the Gulf for 87 days before the spill was contained

   At times, the oil plume was up to 650 feet thick and over a mile wide

   The Deepwater Horizon spill was 18 times the size of the Exxon Valdez
   spill, previously the largest in U.S. history.

   At least 1,300 miles of shoreline was oiled.

   Killed tens of thousands of birds, sea turtles, dolphins and fish

   After the spill a Louisiana dolphin population had higher deaths were 5
   times more likely to have lung disease

   Deep-sea corals can live for 100s or 1,000s of years. After the spill
   some deep-sea coral colonies were damaged, sick and stressed. Some
   entire coral colonies were dead.

   At the height of the spill, 36% of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico
   were closed to fishing, an area of 86,985 square miles.
