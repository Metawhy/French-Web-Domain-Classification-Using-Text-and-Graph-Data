The Curator of Broken Things trilogy is available for preorder

   To me, this has to be one of the least traumatic and more productive
   month of December on record.  My novels are DONE !!! All 3 of them!
   Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

   And yet because the process happened so incrementally it feels natural.
   Normal.  A huge amount of mental preparation must be happening below
   the surface before a writer releases a book. Or 3. By release, what I
   mean is that the book stops being a private thing, and start belonging
   to everyone.

   Before releasing it, the book is pure play. Pure dream and creation.
   Pure potentiality.  Once it is released, who knows? There is aftermath.
   The beautiful secret you cherished for so long suddenly no longer
   belongs to you. It belongs to the readers who might love it, hate it,
   curse it, ignore it, and everything in between.

   The writer dreams of success -- which is, let's admit it, a dream of
   the book being loved by all and for all eternity no less--. But there
   is also the very real possibility of a flop.  That's because writers
   are, above all else, dreamers.  We not only dream up characters and
   plot. We dream that others will want to join us on the ride.

   The mental preparation happens over time, despite yourself, in the
   minutia of spell checks and page count. It is partly a mental
   separation. Like a parent sending a child off into the world. The
   parents has done absolutely everything within his or her power, and at
   some point must let go.

   THE CURATOR OF BROKEN THINGS TRILOGY
   ​The Curator of Broken Things is a family-saga trilogy that takes place
   over a century and across four continents. Multiple narrative threads
   take the reader through love, betrayal, and espionage in a story that
   spans from the last days of the Ottoman Empire to Paris of the Roaring
   Twenties to the prewar French Riviera to the World War II Allied
   landing in North Africa and to modern-day Paris and Los Angeles. In
   this trilogy, three generations of a family’s secrets are unearthed
   that might bring it together or tear it apart.

   The Curator of Broken Things kindle cover book 1
   Book 1: From Smyrna to Paris
   Everything Cassie believes about her father is turned on its head when
   she meets an estranged elderly aunt more than willing to expose family
   secrets that have created riffs across generations. From an ancient
   city in the Ottoman Empire to Paris in the Roaring Twenties to a
   desperate escape from Nazi annihilation, Cassie begins to unearth her
   family’s past and its impact on who she has become.

   The Curator of Broken Things kindle cover book 2
   Book2: Escape to the Côte d'Azur
   A family flees Paris at the dawn of the Second World War, haunted by
   secrets that threaten to rip them apart. Seventy years later, Cassie,
   in modern-day Paris, finds herself alone frantically trying to confront
   her hostile relatives. Meanwhile, puzzled by the advances of a charming
   Frenchman, she struggles to cope with the demands of her manipulative
   ex and gain an understanding of her true self.

   The Curator of Broken Things kindle cover book 3
   Book 3: Resistance in Algiers
   ​Amidst the chaos of the Second World War, and having taken refuge in
   North Africa, Cassie’s parents and grandparents enter the French
   Resistance. As the Nazi threat tightens its noose, they find love and
   risk their lives and one another’s. In modern-day Paris, Cassie, now on
   the cusp of a surprising and disorienting love interest, has to conquer
   her fear of failure and success. When the last shocking piece of her
   family’s puzzle comes into her possession, Cassie must unburden herself
   from several generations of family secrets.

   The ebooks are available for pre-order now. The paperback will be out
   before the end of the month.

So you think you have what it takes to be an audiobook reader?

   Many people are curious about becoming a voice actor, but it’s a skill.
   It’s acting and producing, recording, and editing. So, you can’t just
   be a pretty voice. You have to be an actor and a sound engineer too.
   This is why it was a challenge to find just the right voice actress to
   produce the audiobook for Hidden in Paris, someone who could juggle all
   these things and be able to pronounce French words correctly. In the
   end, I’m thrilled with my collaboration with Phe Caplan.  She was so
   easy to work with and she did a terrific job.

   I thought I would ask her about the process of voice acting and
   audiobook recording. Here is what she had to say:

   Corine: How has your background as an actress helped you with voice
   acting? How is that different from regular acting and how is it
   similar? Is voice acting more liberating or more restrictive?

   Phe: What I love about acting is being able to feel something that I
   may not get to actually experience in my real life. That can be
   exhilarating or painful, but I love the emotion of it all.  Everyday
   life is satisfying in its own way, but the drama and intensity of
   fiction is heightened. That’s why it’s written.  It’s a story that
   needs to be told.  And as an actress, I get to live that. Voice acting
   strips everything down to the bare bones of it all.  The emotion, the
   desires and the way the character views the world.  There are no
   costumes, no makeup, no sets. Just me, the words, and the story behind
   the words. In some ways, it’s not as much fun, and sometimes I have to
   work harder to give it breath, but it is liberating that I don’t have
   to be concerned with how it looks. I don’t have to break up a scene
   into minute details in order to get the right shot. I just have to
   relax, feel the moment, and let it go.

   Corine: You live parts of the year in Germany and you recorded on two
   continents while raising two young children. Besides the logistical and
   technical challenges this presented, how do you feel that your
   experience as a mother and part time expatriate informed how you chose
   to inhabit the characters?

   Phe: I had a deeper understanding of what it means to uproot and
   relocate.  There is a strange thing that happens when you move
   somewhere where you don’t speak the language. At first, there is this
   clinging to the familiar. Trying to make things exactly like they were
   at home. Then, as you begin to trust your new place, you begin to
   embrace the things that are different.  That’s where the growing
   starts. And allowing yourself to love both places is a big one, too. I
   knew that feeling that Annie had when she first moved to France. The
   question of, “What will I do now?” lingers for a while.  But then she,
   like I did, found things she loved about France (Berlin) and grabbed
   onto it.  She sunk her teeth into French more than I was able to with
   German, but the basic tenet is there. I think that goes for Lola and
   Althea too.  They came to France to try to get away from their lives in
   America. But it wasn’t until they were able to accept their new reality
   that they were able to grow and accept themselves, wherever they were.
   And being a mom puts a whole other level of importance on almost
   everything. Priorities shift from ‘what’s best for me’ to ‘what’s best
   for them’ and ‘what’s best for our family’. But it’s also important to
   not let the selflessness get in the way of your mental health and
   sanity. Moms have to be able to take care of themselves, so they are
   able to take care of their kids. Both Annie and Lola really come to
   understand that deeply.

   Corine: How were you able to get so well into the skin of male
   characters? Especially French men?

   Phe: I think the human condition is the same for both men and women,
   it’s just that men express themselves differently. I don’t know that I
   necessarily treated them differently.

   Corine: What parts of the book were the most fun to record, what were
   the most challenging?

   Phe: The beginning is always hardest, until I find my groove. I
   probably recorded and rerecorded the first chapter 10 times before I
   felt that I was ‘in the pocket’.  It’s also tough when a character is
   really crying hard.  It’s difficult to talk through the emotion
   sometimes. And since this is an audiobook, the words and the clarity
   are paramount to anything else, so finding the balance can be tricky.
   But those parts are also the most fun.  And describing the food was
   really fun, too. Especially speaking in French. Those words almost
   taste good in your mouth!

   Corine: Did you identify with a particular character in the novel?

   Phe: I definitely connected a lot with Annie. She and I are very
   similar in how we deal with things. Humor is important to her. And she
   wants to feel the truth of her pain but is afraid to move forward. When
   I was younger, I knew that feeling of the comfort of a deep sadness,
   because the other option, happiness, is sometimes too scary to imagine.
   That involves change, which is hard to do. But being on the other side
   of it now, I understand its importance.

Hidden in Paris as an audiobook!

   These days, I am more likely to listen to a book than to read one. It's
   a matter of time, decreased eyesight (combined with a stubborn refusal
   to wear glasses), and overall general laziness. Books are my first
   great love, but audiobooks are just so full of life and added
   dimension. And on long freeway commutes they appear to be the better
   options :-)

   I wanted Hidden in Paris to be turned into audiobook, so, armed with
   ignorance and a DIY mentality, I thought no big deal. I wrote the whole
   book, for heaven's sake: I'm pretty certain I can read it and record
   myself.

   Hmm. Non.

   I recorded myself and it was hilariously awful.  My French accent --the
   one that I have, for years, believed to be light and discreet --is in
   fact thick as sauce béarnaise. And, to my surprise, I can't seem to say
   three words without saying heuu (French equivalent of hmm) or my throat
   emitting clicking noises like some alien species straight out of Star
   Trek.

   My DIY ambitions were promptly abandoned.

   It was such a fun process, and relief, working with a Pro!  Phe
   Caplan is the voice actress and producer of the audiobook. Phe and I
   discussed the pronunciations of French words, how I envisioned the
   characters' voices and tones, and then she ran with it. She recorded,
   produced, and edited the audiofile, chapter by chapter, uploaded it to
   Audible.com. Her voices, without the slightest throat-clicking noise,
   flews through the characters' personalities, their accents, their
   genders. Phe was also lovely and easy to work with.  If you read this
   and are thinking of hiring a voice actress, she is your person! She can
   do sultry. She can do naive. She can do a 50 year old French man as
   easily as she can do a 25 year old American woman. (I asked her about
   her process and will put our discussion into another post soon.)

   Here is the Hidden in Paris audiobook trailer, please check it out and
   tell me what you think.  PS: my son did the music to the trailer, I
   love it!

To share or not to share

   I was thinking that the meaning of the verb sharing has changed
   dramatically. To share. Partager, in French.  It used to be that
   sharing was to have something and give a bit of it to someone else.
   Sharing was special. It meant something. In the process of sharing you
   became richer, more generous, more human.

   Now we share all the time. We are compelled to share. Society demands
   that we share. But are we sharing the right stuff?  I mean humans have
   grown so unbelievably selfish and insulated on the one hand (probably
   the result of being bombarded by information we cannot fully process),
   yet there are 'share' buttons everywhere. We share on twitter, we share
   on instagram, via email, on facebook. We share willy nilly things that
   weren't ours in the first place: a photograph, a post, a thought.  We
   don't even have to believe the thought. We don't even have to be
   thinking it. But we share it, perhaps in an effort to be relevant, to
   do something. To be something.

   And so it goes full circle. By sharing we add to overwhelming load of
   stuff thats that we human are supposed to process through a day but
   can't. I mean if you are on twitter and instagram, and whatnot, you are
   pulled in so many direction, how can you cope? How can you even find
   the time and sanity required to tie your show laces? Everyone is
   sharing, no one is listening, or caring. Everyone is overwhelmed. There
   is no time. People are counting their followers and their retweets,
   which have become the yardsticks of popularity. If your tweet aren't
   retweeted, and your facebook posts not liked, do you even exist?

   There is apparenly something invented for the occasion called FOMO
   (that's fear of missing out for those of us over the age of 30). We
   don't want to MO (Miss Out ?), but MO on what? On more tweets, more
   facebook posts? More things to rev us up and distract us from any kind
   of depth?

   In the early days of blogging, it felt as though you could make friends
   that way. The world was a gigantic place but through blogging, a few
   people discovered your existence and you discovered theirs, and that
   was really nice. No one was selling anything. Blogs were not platform
   for something else. They weren't glorified sales pitches. Blogging
   wasn't networking, it wasn't working, it wasn't branding. What it was,
   was good old-fashion oversharing.

   And oversharing I did! And promptly got into a heap of trouble with
   friends and family. Oh the delights in hitting that publish button! Oh
   the humanity when you did so on impulse and without measuring the
   effect it might have on your life and other people's.

   So I got a bit scared of it. It became easier to share less of myself
   and more of other people: their thoughts, their ideas, their photos.
   Tweet it, facebook it, instagram it and voila, you had blogged.

   This is a strange time we are in. It's hard to remember what has
   meaning these days. We don't know what is true.  Or deep down we do,
   but we are assailed by everyone's 140 characters opinions smothered in
   a thick sauce of disinformation, so we are not sure we should believe
   our instinct. The new kind of sharing happens at supersonic speed. We
   see something that sounds interesting, or wrong, or worth being on high
   alert and we share it, quick. We want to be the first ones. Also, by
   doing so, we are not taking much of a risk. After all, it isn't our own
   thinking we are messing with. Our own thinking is safe. Or non-existent
   at this point.

   So this is what I want to try to do on this blog: do a little thinking
   of my own and hopefully connect with readers in a meaningful way. Thank
   you for reading all 677 words of this post. I bet not many people will
   have the energy required. Feel free to 'share' your thoughts.

   And then please share :-)

Snow in Paris!

   We interrupt our regular schedule of not posting at all to bring you:
   Snow in Paris!

   I've experienced it only a few times in my life and each time it was
   the most magical thing ever.

   This morning my husband said, "now that it's summer we could-- "  and
   he interrupted himself realizing that this is February. I know it's
   hard to feel sorry for us in Southern California when you live in Fargo
   or something but, believe it or not, 80 degrees in February sucks. I
   crave winter -- and Paris-- with all my being. I want mittens and hot
   coco at Angelina's, and the crunch-crunch sound of my boots on a
   snow-covered Place du Tertre.

Is my blog dead?

   Hello. Hello... hello... hello....?

   That's the cavernous echo of my voice as it calls out to past readers
   of my blog. How many of you are still there?

   For the last few years, I have followed the advice I once heard to
   "keep the drama to the page."

   We all have drama. Okay, maybe me more than you. But there is such
   thing as a drama quota. When I write fiction, I tend to overshare less.
   The sad stuff, the rebellions, the failures, the hopes, the losses, the
   injustices, the heartaches, the gut-wrenching election-induced nuits
   blanches are hopefully transmogrified into decent fiction.

   But now the book is done (books! actually it's 3 books. My spawn is a
   trilogy; it's historical fiction, it's romance, it's the last 5 years
   of my life). What do I do with all the drama? I dump it in the blog,
   that's what.

   So, here I am, putting the finishing touches on the trilogy -- and
   trying to give this blog mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

   Are there any readers left out there? This feels a lot like a bottle in
   the sea.

Hidden in Paris in Bulgarian! Убежище в Париж

   Soon I will return to full-on Blogging. But not now, not quite yet.
   Cause I'm busy. My new book is happening soon I promise. Or should I
   say booksss. It's a trilogy people!

   But today I wanted to share this news: Hidden in Paris was published by
   Colibri in the Bulgarian language!

   Here is my little stash. So pretty. And the recipes are published after
   the story, which I love.

   IMG_3834

   There are very nice reviews here and here.  and jasmin did an interview
   in both Bulgarian and English.  Here is an exterpt of the Interview, go
   here to read the whole thing. They asked me about the secret to a good
   marriage. You know I will have an opinion about that. And about
   everything. Being the queen of unsolicited opinion they did not have to
   twist my arm very long.

   English version of the interview

   Your main character Annie is a woman who has left her home country to
   follow her loved one and start a family across an ocean. I couldn’t
   help but notice that this resembles your own story – moving from France
   to the USA for the family life. Do the other two women characters, Lola
   and Althea, resemble women you know or their life stories are more a
   creation of your imagination?

   I have known women who faced difficult life circumstances such as an
   eating disorder, the death of a spouse, depression, a bad relationship,
   difficult children, but they did not react the way my characters do
   when faced with those situations.

   Fictional characters have their own way of handling things that
   surprise me sometimes. For example I have known women in bad marriage
   who could have and should have ran away but did not. So writing the
   novel was a little bit like me whispering in their ear: Go for it!   In
   the end, the events and the people in the book are not real, but the
   emotion always is.

   Do you think that there is a secret ingredient to a good marriage? If
   yes – what do you think that is?

   I have been married for 28 years and my marriage is surprisingly loving
   and supportive considering that we are both opinionated, stubborn,
   emotional people.

   This might not be something you want to put in your blog, but the
   number one ingredient, I think, is physical attraction. That goes away
   with resentment, unfortunately.

   Often one of the partners can’t be intimate when he or she is mad, and
   the other cannot stop being mad until he or she gets intimate. That’s a
   bad loop.

   The other secrets are this: detect and eradicate any expression of
   contempt for the other. Contempt is subtle but a real killer.

   And the third secret is that you can be right, or you can be happy. Not
   both. If the real goal for both partners is to be happy (not to be
   right), then it’s easy to extend an olive branch after a fight.  Every
   day is an opportunity to create trust and good will, which are the
   foundation of a good relationship.

   The foundation that is built on many little kindnesses and attentions

   happy. You have to look at the situation and be honest with yourself.
