Makeover Madness: TPT {Seller} Challenge

   Linking up with Teach Create Motivate, Peppy Zesty Teacherista,Third in
   Hollywood, and Sparkling in Second Grade for the #tptsellerchallenge!
   I'm glad the girls came up with this because I have been needing some
   motivation to get back into the TPT swing of things.
   https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Complete-K-3-Common-Core-Wr
   iting-Rubrics-and-Checklists-1132347
   I did a big overhaul on my Common Core Writing Rubrics & Checklists! If
   you own these, please go back and re-download!
   What's New?
     * I changed the scales from 0-3 to 1-4, I needed it this way and some
       customers indicated they preferred it because it aligned with
       Marzano's scales. Nobody wants to get a score of 0.  The rubrics
       are scored as "Needs Development" "Approaching" "Proficient" and
       "Exemplary"
     * New fonts-- nothing too cutesy but freshened up :)
     * BONUS: I included Writing Progress Checklists in each of them!

   And it is your lucky day because for just a HOT SECOND you can get the
   bonus Writing checklists for free in my store----with one condition---
   you follow my TPT shop there! It's only a click. :)
   I love using these fast, easy assessments to stick in the report card.
   Check, check, check, boom the parents are informed. ((If you miss the
   freebie they are included in each of my rubric packs))

   ogress-Writing-Checklists-1911411https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Pr
   oduct/BONUS-HOT-SECOND-FREEBIE-Progress-Writing-Checklists-1911411
   Does Common Core not apply to you? Comment which state standards you
   need Writing Rubrics/Checklists for below and I'll add it to my list.
   Ohio is next, then Florida...
   What else do you need teacher-friends?

Football Learning Resources!

   TOUCHDOWN!
    In working on my "Football Science" mini-unit I have come across a
   bunch of helpful, engaging resources on the topic of FOOTBALL for the
   classroom! I will go over them in this post!
   [Football%2BLearning%2BResources.png]
   NBC Learn: Science of Football They recommend this site for grades 6-9,
   however I found that the videos "Geometric Shapes" and "Hydration and
   Health" could be understood and cool for the younger (1st-5th) grades
   since they will be learning about those topics. The videos are about 5
   minutes long and are very well done!
   [NBC%2BLEARN%2B2.png]
   Funbrain Math Football Game This game is super cool because it is so
   easy to differentiate! (SCORE!) You choose an operation (addition,
   subtraction, division, multiplication, or all) and a level of
   difficulty (easy, medium, hard, superbrain) and the kids play
   "football" by solving math facts. This would be an awesome center
   choice in math or great site to recommend for at home learning.
   Tackle Math Football- Math Game for Ipad/Computer  Recommended for
   grades 2-4, can play 5 or 10 minute games human vs. computer or human
   vs. human! Cool for an ipad lab classroom!
   Fun (& Free) Ideas to Involve Football:
     * Have a favorite team? Is there a big game coming up? You could give
       homework passes for a win or maybe "fun homework."
     * Graph your favorite teams. Have students create "teacher questions"
       about the graph results.
     * Writing Prompt: If you could have a job related to a professional
       football team (player, coach, trainer, marketing, agent,
       cheerleader, manager), what would it be? Why?
     * Predator Vs. Prey: analyze match ups of mascots. Who would really
       win? For example: Dolphins vs. Jaguars. Which animal would survive?
       Have students research the animals and describe which animal would
       win in a real life battle.
     * Character Education writing prompt: Why is it important for
       athletes to show good sportsmanship? What does good sportsmanship
       look like?
     * Prediction: Connect making predictions in a story to making
       predictions in a football game
     * If your district has access to Brainpop, there is a football
       learning video on there as well! (Also quiz, vocabulary, all the
       good stuff!)


   Here's a sneak peak of my Football Reading & Science Activities
   Mini-Unit:
   Pulse Investigation: Fun science & math activity to see how your pulse
   changes with different activities.
   [Slide6.PNG] Shape Investigation:
   Studentes will explore with different ball types to see which is the
   best for different categories.
   [Slide3.PNG]
   Two Non-Fiction Mini-Books (with picture directions on how to make
   them)
   [Slide5.PNG]
   Fun Creative & Higher Order Thinking Project: Students create their own
   professional football team.

  October Currently!

   I love Fall! I'm so excited for October to be here! I'm linking up
   Farley from Oh' Boy 4th Grade!
   [currently%2Boctober.png]
   LISTENING: Yes, I'm watching the Muppets in Space movie while blogging
   and working on my computer on a Saturday night. Don't start feeling bad
   for me. I have had a very amazing week. My boyfriend surprised me to
   see David Gray on Tuesday night, which allowed me to check that off my
   Concert Bucket List. Last night we went and saw Citizen Cope and that
   was super awesome.
   LOVING: I took some time out of the classroom this fall to focus on my
   writing and I was working with a company in private schools that
   provided intervention to kids below grade level. This was really nice
   for flexibility and for my writing. However, then I have decided that I
   want to move back to Ohio. I miss my family so so much and that's
   driving my decision. I'm pulling a Lebron in spring 2015 and headed
   back.  In light of that, I need a little bit more savings to be ready
   for the big move.  As fate would have it, a fabulous school I
   interviewed with this summer called and asked if I was interested in
   covering a Gifted Kindergarten maternity leave from October- February.
   I am soooo excited to work with this grade level and to be able to save
   a little bit so I can move to Columbus. I prefer second, and first
   grade, but I am really excited to add some more kindergarten experience
   to my repertoire!
   Any Ohio Bloggers out there? Leave me a note in the comments!
   THINKING: Like many of you, I am a pumpkin-aholic. Does it have pumpkin
   in it? Okay I'm in.  Last year I even made a pumpkinbucketlist.
   (Interested? Find the link in the "Treat" section coming up). Sooooooo
   the other day I went to Starbucks (if you've read my post "How Getting
   Kicked Out of Starbucks Helped My Kids Put Their Names on Their Papers"
   this should not come as a shock) and as I was checking out I saw these
   cute little cake pops in packages of two. The boyfriend and I were
   driving to make a delivery for his work and the cake pops seemed like a
   nice treat for the drive. They were salted caramel and they were
   INCREDIBLE. At my favorite local coffee shop the owner boasts about
   their salted caramel gelato...so I think I'm shifting my fall flavor
   focus to salted caramel. So that's that.
   WANTING: My Giveaway Groupies Linky will go LIVE tomorrow and I would
   LOVE if people would link up! It should be nice and easy and fun! You
   will GIVE an idea, GIVE some love, GIVE me a break, and GIVEAWAY!
   Pretty please with sugar on top, link up with me tomorrow. Thanks!
   NEEDING: to make some new clip art. My 2 month old computer crashed two
   weeks ago (Yes, I lost 2 months of work- don't get me started) and now
   it is back from the shop! Yay! That means I'm ready to crank out some
   new clip art sets!  My favorites so far are my Monster Clip Art, Owl
   Clip Art, and Halloween Clip Art. What should I make next? Open to
   suggestions!

Technology Thursday! Website Week- NBC LEARN

   Hi there! Linking up with Teaching Trio for Website Week in the
   Technology Thursday Link Up!
   [Tech%2BThursday%2BButton-NEW.png]
   This linky is an awesome one to keep up with to learn about new
   technology resources!
   [NBC%2BLEARN%2B2.png]
   A new resource that I have come across is NBC Learn. There are oodles
   of high interest videos that could be incorporated in the classroom.
   What caught my eye to this site in the first place is the Science of
   Football section. I have been working on a little "Football Science"
   mini-unit and came across this site while working on it. The Science of
   Football section has information about force, motion, healthy eating,
   and more! Also, with each video are lesson ideas! Coolness. This could
   be a great introduction or review of science topics.
   #reallifeapplicationsrule
   [NBC%2BLEARN.png] Another section that I particularly like is the
   "Writers Speak to Kids" section. Numerous authors have little videos
   about the craft of writing. Mo Willems is on there (um hello, awesome!)
   Judy Schachner, Ridley Pearson, Doreen Cronin, these are authors of the
   books you use to teach to the craft of writing, how cool is a live
   interview talking about the process? This is a great resource for
   Writing Workshop and I'm totally pumped to implement it!
   Have you heard of or used NBC Learn before? If so, let me know in the
   comments! If you know of another killer resource, let me know too! I
   LOVE hearing from you!
