   It’s been a full two decades since the US National Park Service decided
   to reintroduce wolves into Yellowstone National Park. We spoke with
   Doug Smith, senior wildlife biologist at the park and the man who has
   been there since the start.

   At 54 years of age, Doug has been working with wolves for 36 years. And
   now in his 21st year at Yellowstone, he can look down with pride on an
   operation that sees 11 packs roaming free.

   Wolves were pretty much hunted to extinction in the 1800s and early
   1900s, leaving the whole park largely void of what is now its most
   iconic animal from 1926 to 1995. No more.

   Tracking the 100 wild wolves incessantly, his team collar up to 20 a
   year, keeping tabs on the animals’ movement, hunting habits, pack
   traits, biology and disease.

   With prey including elk, deer and bison also monitored and tracked,
   it’s a mammoth operation and one which relies on swathes of data,
   dozens of pairs of eyes, helicopter flights and a radio frequency with
   a troubled history.

   But for Doug, a life’s work is a life’s work.

   “Our goal is to protect them,” he says. “That’s the goal of the US
   National Parks Service, to provide a sanctuary for animals, plants and
   geology.”

   By checking bloods regularly, and ensuring every pack is accounted for,
   Doug and his team’s work is aiding conservation and reintroduction
   efforts globally.

   You could say it’s the most extensive wolf research operation on
   Earth. “I would say intensive,” he interrupts.

   “Intensive and extensive are different things. We may be the most
   extensive too, but… Yellowstone is big, but it’s not that big.”

   Doug feels he is working with the most in-depth data on wolves anywhere
   in the world, thanks to a range of techniques.

   Around 40pc of the park’s animals are situated along the road network
   that traverses the park – which helps researchers observe their ways –
   with constant flights in helicopters allowing broader views of what’s
   going on.

   Elk in Yellowstone are prey for wolves

   Then there are the collars, which aren’t as straightforward a tool as
   they may seem. GPS collars yield far better data for research, for
   example, but they are less reliable than basic tracking collars, don’t
   last as long and can break at any moment.

   “So we use other collars, too, that we can track,” says Doug, adding
   that these work as a safety net.

   Another safety net is the need to collar more than one wolf per pack,
   with a number of reasons causing the devices to lose their usefulness
   at any moment.

   “We collar two or three per pack. We’ve collared over 500 since the
   programme began. Wolves die, they leave the pack… these things happen,”
   he says.

All we hear is radio ga ga

   Other ‘things that happen’, surprisingly, are issues with radio
   frequency contracts – something Doug and his fellow researchers
   discovered to their cost recently.

   In what was not much more than an oversight, the frequency used at
   Yellowstone on the tracking collars was bought by a private company
   after park staff didn’t realise the contract had expired.

   “It was one of those things we just didn’t think about,” he says. “We
   lost our licence unbeknownst to me or anybody else, we never thought of
   it. So that frequency band went up for sale and an energy company
   purchased it and started using it.”

   This could have proved monumentally costly, with the collars becoming
   relatively useless as interference made the tracking pretty difficult
   to achieve – one option discussed was to recapture all the tracked
   animals and reapply new collars, something that would have set the team
   back an age.

Compromise is key

   That was not feasible, though, and luckily an agreement was reached
   whereby Doug – who put his own name on a new radio licence (the
   previous one was under a now-retired staff member, thus the confusion)
   – helped negotiate an agreement to make the particular frequency
   workable with the park until the collars expire in 3-5 years’ time.

   “The company that bought the licence turned down their frequency… I
   don’t know the science behind that side of things,” he says. “It’s a
   pain, but it’s a switch over that takes time and effort.”

   Although it seems like this whole project boils down to time and
   effort. Every wolf that is caught – by tranquiliser, from the safety of
   a helicopter – has its blood taken to test for canine distemper and
   canine parvovirus.

   Park researchers also take bloods to learn how the wolves are evolving,
   how they adapt to Yellowstone and how they survive.

   “A lot of that is based on condition, but we also want to get
   information on disease. We have a robust disease-monitoring programme,”
   he says.

   “Disease interplays with condition, so we’re trying to develop measures
   to assess condition. Some animals live through disease better than
   others. We’re not sure why… but we think we know why, so we’re testing
   that.”

   The current tally of around 100 wolves is not a peak figure for the
   programme, with 174 in the park 12 years ago, but that was “a bit of an
   overshoot”, he says, with today’s figure more naturally sustainable in
   the park.

   And numbers are key. Yellowstone is designed for tourists, meaning any
   animal introduced into the park has to accept that it will interact
   with humans at some point.

   There’s a road network and hiking trails dotted around the near 3,500
   square miles of land. That means the animals must tolerate humans, “but
   not be habituated to them” says Doug. In instances like that, the
   animals are “hazed”.

   “We don’t want to bother them but if they walk up to people and beg for
   food, we have to haze them.”

   With so much work done on wolves, and so much experience garnered by
   Doug – just one member of the whole operation – it’s obvious why other
   efforts to manage wolf populations seek out Yellowstone for answers.

   Doug thinks many look towards Yellowstone for discoveries, “new
   things”, with him speaking to me soon after a conference call with one
   of the world’s top canid geneticists.

   “We probably know more about the genetic relationships and the disease
   dynamics of the wolves in Yellowstone then any other wolf population,”
   he says.

   “What we’re learning, other people rely on. We have a very in-depth
   knowledge of what wolves do to their prey. That’s a big question on
   management concern, I believe. A lot of people are looking to us for
   answers on that.”

   No better person to ask, so…

   Kelly McCabe from Scoil Carmel Junior National School in Firhouse,
   Dublin, will soon see her design grace the homepage of the world’s most
   popular search engine as the winner of the sixth annual Doodle 4 Google
   competition.

   Almost 2,400 students entered this year’s competition, whittled down to
   75 finalists by a panel of judges including Imaginosity marketing
   manager Ciara O’Shea, Irish artist Christine Crotty, and Jim
   Fitzpatrick, creator of the iconic red and black 1968 Che Guevara
   poster.

   These designs were then put up for a public vote, and over 120,000
   people chose their favourites from each category.

   It was then down to professional Doodler Katy Wu to crown the champion.
   “This is my first year to judge the Doodle 4 Google competition and I
   was blown away by the talent and creativity shown by the entries; it
   was a tough job trying to choose an overall winner,” she said. “Kelly’s
   Doodle stood out to me with its fun design and bright colours.”

   McCabe, who is just eight years old, was both surprised and delighted
   to have won the overall competition, and will take home a Chromebook
   plus a €5,000 scholarship while her school will receive a €10,000
   technology grant and teacher Teresa Lea also won a Chromebook.

   The prizes were presented today at Google’s EMEA headquarters in Dublin
   by Wu, who flew in from the company’s HQ in Mountain View.

   The theme for this year’s competition was ‘My Adventure’ and McCabe’s
   jungle adventure incorporating elephants, lions and snakes will appear
   on Google.ie on Wednesday March 26th.

   Describing her doodle, McCabe said, “The jungle is where you can find
   lots of exciting things, just like Google.”

   Scoil Carmel Junior National School in Firhouse, Dublin:

Media at the crossroads – embrace digital or die?

   Ireland’s US$4.8bn entertainment and media industries are set to enjoy
   a 2.7pc growth in 2012 after several years of decline, a global Media
   Outlook Study by PwC predicts. However, in reality the picture is not
   as rosy as it sounds – traditional media entities, such as newspapers,
   are in decline.

   In a market where fewer under-25s are buying newspapers than ever
   before (this writer knows 24-year-olds who have yet to buy their first
   newspaper), preferring to snack on content shared across social media
   available on their smartphones, the growth of media in Ireland in 2012
   will be predominantly driven by digital.

   In 2012, the Irish internet advertising market was valued at US$187m
   and is set to grow at an annual rate of 15.4pc to US$383m in 2016.

   This will position internet advertising as the largest advertising
   channel in Ireland, representing almost 30pc of the total 2016
   advertising market, PwC’s latest Global Entertainment & Media Outlook
   predicts.

   Other segments of the industry which are expected to perform well over
   the five-year period include internet access (9.1pc CAGR), TV
   subscriptions and licence fees (4.6pc CAGR) and video games (4.6pc
   CAGR).

   While newspaper publishing remains the largest segment in Ireland at
   US$902m in 2011, continued declines in print circulation and near-term
   decreases in print advertising will lead to a half of 1pc compound
   annual decrease during the next five years to US$878m in 2016.

   Book publishing, magazine publishing and filmed entertainment are also
   expected to see compound annual decreases during the next five years.

Writing on the wall – get with it or get out

   PwC’s Bartley O’Connor says that to survive Irish media will need to
   embed digital in their DNA. “It’s been going this way for awhile and
   they need to embrace the way the world is going; either get with it or
   get out. The writing has been on the wall.”

   O’Connor says that turning to digital isn’t an easy option for many
   traditional outlets and abandoning a long-standing model for new
   digital models doesn’t make sense and won’t work.

   “In reality the more progressive of the traditional media houses are
   trying to keep two models going – the existing traditional business
   that still commands loyalty as well as moving towards an integrated
   digital strategy.”

   O’Connor stresses that this move to digital is not just about
   processes, it will be about people, as well.

   “People in areas like broadcasting and newspapers will want to continue
   to do what they’ve always done, so not everyone is going to make the
   transition.”

   That transition involves accommodating new forms of media, such as
   video along with text, understanding metadata, developing a personal
   brand, engaging in social media strategies to encourage the sharing of
   stories and paying attention to analytics. It also means realising that
   readers will no longer communicate solely via ‘letters to the editor’
   but will stress their views rather loudly via social media platforms
   like Twitter or Facebook.

   “Younger people in these organisations, in particular, will embrace the
   changes, but the writer of a 20 or 30-year-old column mightn’t embrace
   the new work qualities and this is something they and their management
   will struggle with.

   “The reality is there is always going to be a need for quality
   journalism, especially if you can aggregate the views of people and get
   an understanding of the general mood around an issue, but media will
   need to realise it is no longer about sitting in a pulpit passing out
   your view on a topic.

   “You are going to see a transformation of journalism – the same skills
   will apply in terms of accurate reporting of the facts – but there will
   be a need for a different mindset. Good journalists, whatever the
   device or platform their creations are read over, the basis will be the
   same: if someone can report about a football match and manage to inform
   and entertain, it won’t matter whether it’s been read on a smartphone
   or an iPad.”

   However, the challenge is monetisation – if most newspaper and magazine
   content is available online for free why would consumers rush into a
   shop and hand over money?

   The answer appears to be somewhere in the middle – meeting the reader
   in the way they will consume and stay loyal to the product. Channels
   like Newsstand on the iPad have been readily embraced by brands like
   The Guardian and The New York Times, but are they the answer?

   “We did a significant piece of work with one of the leading global
   magazines,” O’Connor explains. “The CEO spoke about a survey of readers
   and one of the questions was, ‘how do you expect to consume our
   product?’ Eighty per cent of readers answered that today it will be the
   physical magazine. They were then asked how they expect to consume the
   product in three years and more than 30pc said they expect to consume
   the magazine via digital channels.

   “The customers are telling them they like what they have created, but
   want to be lead into the digital age. The balancing act is moving
   direction but not losing revenue along the way as they move from
   physical to digital. Virtually every single thing has to change – from
   how content is created, how it is priced, marketed and sold.

   “This is about technology, process and people – not just sticking a PDF
   on your website – you have to do it properly,” O’Connor warns.

Channelling change

   Video, O’Connor emphasises, is going to be of paramount importance in
   the years ahead because it will have the power to inform and
   communicate in a way that is beyond text.

   O’Connor points to a 2010 TED presentation by Chris Anderson (or see
   below) which demonstrated how children in Africa, the US and Asia are
   becoming popular media figures in their own rights, using smartphones
   to share dance moves, guitar lessons and more. “A kid in Kenya did his
   own TED presentation via smartphone. This shows that barriers are being
   broken down in a way that is faster than many in media can comprehend.

   “Linear TV is going to be fundamentally changed and this area could
   decline faster than newspapers so broadcasters face immense challenges
   re-orienting their offerings to the constantly connected consumer who
   wants content on-demand.

   “There is still work to be done in creating and aggregating quality
   content – that is the next chapter in where all of this is going.

   “Radio is still strong in Ireland, local radio stations, in particular,
   are holding up well.

   “The challenge will be meeting the consumer by understanding metadata,
   understanding their past behaviour and interests and weaving it all
   together.

   “There will be casualties – we’re calling this year’s report ‘End of
   the Digital Beginning’.

   “More companies in media get it that people are migrating to digital.
   There will be fallout, some people won’t adapt fast enough while others
   will and many will try and keep the two horses going at the same time
   while migrating to digital channels in a slow, measured way.

   “The bigger players in newspapers won’t be shutting down print titles.
   But, if you can’t downsize costs, if you have a cost base that isn’t
   flexible enough – expensive offices, for example – revenues will drop
   and won’t be maintained.

   “The trick will be managing people, processes and costs. The challenge
   will be to maintain something tangible in a world where content is
   everywhere. A brand like The Financial Times, for example, has
   succeeded in a creating physical and digital entity that is
   trustworthy, timely and offers greater insight than before,” O’Connor
   says.

Did you know there’s more than one type of imposter syndrome?

   by Jenny Darmody

   3 Jul 20182.33k Views

   Are you waiting to be ‘found out’ for the fraud you think you are?

   I’ve written about imposter syndrome before. It’s a topic I feel
   extremely strongly about because it can stand in the way of someone’s
   success. However, getting rid of it is easier said than done.

   Last year, I spoke to psychologist Gerry Hussey about what it is, why
   it exists, and how to manage and eradicate it.

   But that was imposter syndrome in the broadest possible sense. It’s the
   version we as a society have become most familiar with, and most of us
   can relate to it on some level.

   However, there is a number of different types of imposter syndrome that
   affect different people. Specific situations such as a promotion can
   also bring on feelings of self-doubt.

   Knowing and properly identifying with the right kind of imposter
   syndrome you currently suffer from could be the key to working through
   it a little more easily.

Different types of imposter syndrome

   Some estimates say that 70pc of the population experience imposter
   syndrome at some point in their lives, but not all experiences are the
   same.

   Fast Company had an excellent piece last year on the five types of
   imposter syndrome according to imposter syndrome expert Dr Valerie
   Young, including perfectionists, workaholics and so-called ‘natural
   geniuses’.

   In brief, perfectionists set ridiculously high standards for themselves
   and then feel like failures when they don’t reach them.

   The superman or superwoman of the office always feels like they’re
   playing catch-up with their other colleagues and therefore resorts to
   overworking.

   Natural geniuses are similar to perfectionists, with impossibly high
   standards. However, they also expect to get everything right on the
   first try.

   The individualist feels like they are an imposter if they need to ask
   for help.

   Finally, the expert is the one we are probably most familiar with:
   someone who believes they somehow tricked their employer into getting a
   job they have no right to because they never feel truly qualified
   enough.

Diversity and imposter syndrome

   We should all know by now the importance of diversity and inclusion in
   the workplace. Aside from the societal and representational importance
   of having a diverse set of voices, thought processes and opinions at
   the table, there is another side that must be addressed.

   Imposter syndrome can come into play in a very particular way for
   women, minorities or LGBTQ individuals. Someone who doesn’t match the
   majority of a group or culture can often succumb to imposter syndrome
   despite their qualifications and abilities.

   A lack of role models or mentors can play a part in this, as those in a
   minority who are wondering if they even deserve to be there have no one
   to turn to or look up to.

   Furthermore, negative stereotypes about diversity initiatives and
   gender quotas can lead people to believe that, despite all of their
   achievements, qualifications and experience, others will think they are
   there due to tokenism, and not based on merit.

   These negative connotations can often seep into their own mind and so,
   imposter syndrome begins to fester. In a feature written last year for
   ASBMB Today, two underrepresented minority students spoke about how the
   notion of being part of some sort of diversity quota led to both of
   them suffering from imposter syndrome.

Promotions

   What differentiates imposter syndrome from low self-esteem is the
   trajectory. The more successful you become and the higher up the career
   ladder you climb, the more likely imposter syndrome is to present
   itself.

   A promotion is one of the most common situations that can bring about a
   sudden wave of imposter syndrome, even if you hadn’t felt it up until
   that point.

   Once new responsibilities and jobs come into the fray, so too do new
   doubts, worries and feelings of inadequacy for the job at hand. ‘I was
   comfortable in my own job, I knew what I was doing. I had a manager to
   ask for help. Now, I am the manager and in way over my head.’ Sound
   familiar? That’s because you’re not alone.

   People who are promoted can often feel like they were simply in the
   right place at the right time, and that the promotion has nothing to do
   with merit. But the fact is, employers don’t promote someone simply
   because they’re the easiest choice. They still have to be the best
   choice.

   If you believe in your employer’s judge of character and their ability
   to do their job, then you must believe that you would not be able to
   pull the wool over their eyes and secure a promotion that you didn’t
   deserve. If you find it hard to trust that you’re good at your job, at
   least trust that they’re good at theirs.

Talk to your boss

   Whether it’s because you fall into one of the five common types of
   imposter syndrome sufferers listed above, or you feel your imposter
   syndrome is a product of a particular situation, it’s important not to
   let it fester.

   Feeling like an imposter is not just detrimental to your own mental
   health – side effects such as being afraid to make a mistake, speak up
   about an idea or ask for help are just some of the things that can
   really affect your performance at work.

   If you’re suffering from imposter syndrome, it’s a good idea to talk to
   your manager about it. Ask for guidance on elements of your job that
   specifically make you feel intimidated. It’s OK not to know what you’re
   doing all of the time.

   And, statistically speaking, it’s highly likely that your boss has
   experienced the same feeling at some point in their own career.

Meet Doug, the wolf watcher of Yellowstone National Park

   It’s been a full two decades since the US National Park Service decided
   to reintroduce wolves into Yellowstone National Park. We spoke with
   Doug Smith, senior wildlife biologist at the park and the man who has
   been there since the start.

   At 54 years of age, Doug has been working with wolves for 36 years. And
   now in his 21st year at Yellowstone, he can look down with pride on an
   operation that sees 11 packs roaming free.

   Wolves were pretty much hunted to extinction in the 1800s and early
   1900s, leaving the whole park largely void of what is now its most
   iconic animal from 1926 to 1995. No more.

   Tracking the 100 wild wolves incessantly, his team collar up to 20 a
   year, keeping tabs on the animals’ movement, hunting habits, pack
   traits, biology and disease.

   With prey including elk, deer and bison also monitored and tracked,
   it’s a mammoth operation and one which relies on swathes of data,
   dozens of pairs of eyes, helicopter flights and a radio frequency with
   a troubled history.

   But for Doug, a life’s work is a life’s work.

   “Our goal is to protect them,” he says. “That’s the goal of the US
   National Parks Service, to provide a sanctuary for animals, plants and
   geology.”

   By checking bloods regularly, and ensuring every pack is accounted for,
   Doug and his team’s work is aiding conservation and reintroduction
   efforts globally.

   You could say it’s the most extensive wolf research operation on
   Earth. “I would say intensive,” he interrupts.

   “Intensive and extensive are different things. We may be the most
   extensive too, but… Yellowstone is big, but it’s not that big.”

   Doug feels he is working with the most in-depth data on wolves anywhere
   in the world, thanks to a range of techniques.

   Around 40pc of the park’s animals are situated along the road network
   that traverses the park – which helps researchers observe their ways –
   with constant flights in helicopters allowing broader views of what’s
   going on.

   Elk in Yellowstone are prey for wolves

   Then there are the collars, which aren’t as straightforward a tool as
   they may seem. GPS collars yield far better data for research, for
   example, but they are less reliable than basic tracking collars, don’t
   last as long and can break at any moment.

   “So we use other collars, too, that we can track,” says Doug, adding
   that these work as a safety net.

   Another safety net is the need to collar more than one wolf per pack,
   with a number of reasons causing the devices to lose their usefulness
   at any moment.

   “We collar two or three per pack. We’ve collared over 500 since the
   programme began. Wolves die, they leave the pack… these things happen,”
   he says.

All we hear is radio ga ga

   Other ‘things that happen’, surprisingly, are issues with radio
   frequency contracts – something Doug and his fellow researchers
   discovered to their cost recently.

   In what was not much more than an oversight, the frequency used at
   Yellowstone on the tracking collars was bought by a private company
   after park staff didn’t realise the contract had expired.

   “It was one of those things we just didn’t think about,” he says. “We
   lost our licence unbeknownst to me or anybody else, we never thought of
   it. So that frequency band went up for sale and an energy company
   purchased it and started using it.”

   This could have proved monumentally costly, with the collars becoming
   relatively useless as interference made the tracking pretty difficult
   to achieve – one option discussed was to recapture all the tracked
   animals and reapply new collars, something that would have set the team
   back an age.

Compromise is key

   That was not feasible, though, and luckily an agreement was reached
   whereby Doug – who put his own name on a new radio licence (the
   previous one was under a now-retired staff member, thus the confusion)
   – helped negotiate an agreement to make the particular frequency
   workable with the park until the collars expire in 3-5 years’ time.

   “The company that bought the licence turned down their frequency… I
   don’t know the science behind that side of things,” he says. “It’s a
   pain, but it’s a switch over that takes time and effort.”

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/40304620

   Although it seems like this whole project boils down to time and
   effort. Every wolf that is caught – by tranquiliser, from the safety of
   a helicopter – has its blood taken to test for canine distemper and
   canine parvovirus.

   Park researchers also take bloods to learn how the wolves are evolving,
   how they adapt to Yellowstone and how they survive.

   “A lot of that is based on condition, but we also want to get
   information on disease. We have a robust disease-monitoring programme,”
   he says.

   “Disease interplays with condition, so we’re trying to develop measures
   to assess condition. Some animals live through disease better than
   others. We’re not sure why… but we think we know why, so we’re testing
   that.”
   Yellowstone wolves

   The current tally of around 100 wolves is not a peak figure for the
   programme, with 174 in the park 12 years ago, but that was “a bit of an
   overshoot”, he says, with today’s figure more naturally sustainable in
   the park.

   And numbers are key. Yellowstone is designed for tourists, meaning any
   animal introduced into the park has to accept that it will interact
   with humans at some point.

   There’s a road network and hiking trails dotted around the near 3,500
   square miles of land. That means the animals must tolerate humans, “but
   not be habituated to them” says Doug. In instances like that, the
   animals are “hazed”.

   “We don’t want to bother them but if they walk up to people and beg for
   food, we have to haze them.”

   With so much work done on wolves, and so much experience garnered by
   Doug – just one member of the whole operation – it’s obvious why other
   efforts to manage wolf populations seek out Yellowstone for answers.

   Doug thinks many look towards Yellowstone for discoveries, “new
   things”, with him speaking to me soon after a conference call with one
   of the world’s top canid geneticists.

   “We probably know more about the genetic relationships and the disease
   dynamics of the wolves in Yellowstone then any other wolf population,”
   he says.

   “What we’re learning, other people rely on. We have a very in-depth
   knowledge of what wolves do to their prey. That’s a big question on
   management concern, I believe. A lot of people are looking to us for
   answers on that.”

   No better person to ask, so…

   Kelly McCabe from Scoil Carmel Junior National School in Firhouse,
   Dublin, will soon see her design grace the homepage of the world’s most
   popular search engine as the winner of the sixth annual Doodle 4 Google
   competition.

   Almost 2,400 students entered this year’s competition, whittled down to
   75 finalists by a panel of judges including Imaginosity marketing
   manager Ciara O’Shea, Irish artist Christine Crotty, and Jim
   Fitzpatrick, creator of the iconic red and black 1968 Che Guevara
   poster.

   These designs were then put up for a public vote, and over 120,000
   people chose their favourites from each category.

   It was then down to professional Doodler Katy Wu to crown the champion.
   “This is my first year to judge the Doodle 4 Google competition and I
   was blown away by the talent and creativity shown by the entries; it
   was a tough job trying to choose an overall winner,” she said. “Kelly’s
   Doodle stood out to me with its fun design and bright colours.”

   McCabe, who is just eight years old, was both surprised and delighted
   to have won the overall competition, and will take home a Chromebook
   plus a €5,000 scholarship while her school will receive a €10,000
   technology grant and teacher Teresa Lea also won a Chromebook.

   The prizes were presented today at Google’s EMEA headquarters in Dublin
   by Wu, who flew in from the company’s HQ in Mountain View.

   The theme for this year’s competition was ‘My Adventure’ and McCabe’s
   jungle adventure incorporating elephants, lions and snakes will appear
   on Google.ie on Wednesday March 26th.

   Describing her doodle, McCabe said, “The jungle is where you can find
   lots of exciting things, just like Google.”

   Scoil Carmel Junior National School in Firhouse, Dublin:

Media at the crossroads – embrace digital or die?

   Ireland’s US$4.8bn entertainment and media industries are set to enjoy
   a 2.7pc growth in 2012 after several years of decline, a global Media
   Outlook Study by PwC predicts. However, in reality the picture is not
   as rosy as it sounds – traditional media entities, such as newspapers,
   are in decline.

   In a market where fewer under-25s are buying newspapers than ever
   before (this writer knows 24-year-olds who have yet to buy their first
   newspaper), preferring to snack on content shared across social media
   available on their smartphones, the growth of media in Ireland in 2012
   will be predominantly driven by digital.

   In 2012, the Irish internet advertising market was valued at US$187m
   and is set to grow at an annual rate of 15.4pc to US$383m in 2016.

   This will position internet advertising as the largest advertising
   channel in Ireland, representing almost 30pc of the total 2016
   advertising market, PwC’s latest Global Entertainment & Media Outlook
   predicts.

   Other segments of the industry which are expected to perform well over
   the five-year period include internet access (9.1pc CAGR), TV
   subscriptions and licence fees (4.6pc CAGR) and video games (4.6pc
   CAGR).

   While newspaper publishing remains the largest segment in Ireland at
   US$902m in 2011, continued declines in print circulation and near-term
   decreases in print advertising will lead to a half of 1pc compound
   annual decrease during the next five years to US$878m in 2016.

   Book publishing, magazine publishing and filmed entertainment are also
   expected to see compound annual decreases during the next five years.

Writing on the wall – get with it or get out

   PwC’s Bartley O’Connor says that to survive Irish media will need to
   embed digital in their DNA. “It’s been going this way for awhile and
   they need to embrace the way the world is going; either get with it or
   get out. The writing has been on the wall.”

   O’Connor says that turning to digital isn’t an easy option for many
   traditional outlets and abandoning a long-standing model for new
   digital models doesn’t make sense and won’t work.

   “In reality the more progressive of the traditional media houses are
   trying to keep two models going – the existing traditional business
   that still commands loyalty as well as moving towards an integrated
   digital strategy.”

   O’Connor stresses that this move to digital is not just about
   processes, it will be about people, as well.

   “People in areas like broadcasting and newspapers will want to continue
   to do what they’ve always done, so not everyone is going to make the
   transition.”

   That transition involves accommodating new forms of media, such as
   video along with text, understanding metadata, developing a personal
   brand, engaging in social media strategies to encourage the sharing of
   stories and paying attention to analytics. It also means realising that
   readers will no longer communicate solely via ‘letters to the editor’
   but will stress their views rather loudly via social media platforms
   like Twitter or Facebook.

   “Younger people in these organisations, in particular, will embrace the
   changes, but the writer of a 20 or 30-year-old column mightn’t embrace
   the new work qualities and this is something they and their management
   will struggle with.

   “The reality is there is always going to be a need for quality
   journalism, especially if you can aggregate the views of people and get
   an understanding of the general mood around an issue, but media will
   need to realise it is no longer about sitting in a pulpit passing out
   your view on a topic.

   “You are going to see a transformation of journalism – the same skills
   will apply in terms of accurate reporting of the facts – but there will
   be a need for a different mindset. Good journalists, whatever the
   device or platform their creations are read over, the basis will be the
   same: if someone can report about a football match and manage to inform
   and entertain, it won’t matter whether it’s been read on a smartphone
   or an iPad.”

   However, the challenge is monetisation – if most newspaper and magazine
   content is available online for free why would consumers rush into a
   shop and hand over money?

   The answer appears to be somewhere in the middle – meeting the reader
   in the way they will consume and stay loyal to the product. Channels
   like Newsstand on the iPad have been readily embraced by brands like
   The Guardian and The New York Times, but are they the answer?

   “We did a significant piece of work with one of the leading global
   magazines,” O’Connor explains. “The CEO spoke about a survey of readers
   and one of the questions was, ‘how do you expect to consume our
   product?’ Eighty per cent of readers answered that today it will be the
   physical magazine. They were then asked how they expect to consume the
   product in three years and more than 30pc said they expect to consume
   the magazine via digital channels.

   “The customers are telling them they like what they have created, but
   want to be lead into the digital age. The balancing act is moving
   direction but not losing revenue along the way as they move from
   physical to digital. Virtually every single thing has to change – from
   how content is created, how it is priced, marketed and sold.

   “This is about technology, process and people – not just sticking a PDF
   on your website – you have to do it properly,” O’Connor warns.

Channelling change

   Video, O’Connor emphasises, is going to be of paramount importance in
   the years ahead because it will have the power to inform and
   communicate in a way that is beyond text.

   O’Connor points to a 2010 TED presentation by Chris Anderson (or see
   below) which demonstrated how children in Africa, the US and Asia are
   becoming popular media figures in their own rights, using smartphones
   to share dance moves, guitar lessons and more. “A kid in Kenya did his
   own TED presentation via smartphone. This shows that barriers are being
   broken down in a way that is faster than many in media can comprehend.

   “Linear TV is going to be fundamentally changed and this area could
   decline faster than newspapers so broadcasters face immense challenges
   re-orienting their offerings to the constantly connected consumer who
   wants content on-demand.

   “There is still work to be done in creating and aggregating quality
   content – that is the next chapter in where all of this is going.

   “Radio is still strong in Ireland, local radio stations, in particular,
   are holding up well.

   “The challenge will be meeting the consumer by understanding metadata,
   understanding their past behaviour and interests and weaving it all
   together.

   “There will be casualties – we’re calling this year’s report ‘End of
   the Digital Beginning’.

   “More companies in media get it that people are migrating to digital.
   There will be fallout, some people won’t adapt fast enough while others
   will and many will try and keep the two horses going at the same time
   while migrating to digital channels in a slow, measured way.

   “The bigger players in newspapers won’t be shutting down print titles.
   But, if you can’t downsize costs, if you have a cost base that isn’t
   flexible enough – expensive offices, for example – revenues will drop
   and won’t be maintained.

   “The trick will be managing people, processes and costs. The challenge
   will be to maintain something tangible in a world where content is
   everywhere. A brand like The Financial Times, for example, has
   succeeded in a creating physical and digital entity that is
   trustworthy, timely and offers greater insight than before,” O’Connor
   says.

Did you know there’s more than one type of imposter syndrome?

   by Jenny Darmody

   3 Jul 20182.33k Views

   Are you waiting to be ‘found out’ for the fraud you think you are?

   I’ve written about imposter syndrome before. It’s a topic I feel
   extremely strongly about because it can stand in the way of someone’s
   success. However, getting rid of it is easier said than done.

   Last year, I spoke to psychologist Gerry Hussey about what it is, why
   it exists, and how to manage and eradicate it.

   But that was imposter syndrome in the broadest possible sense. It’s the
   version we as a society have become most familiar with, and most of us
   can relate to it on some level.

   However, there is a number of different types of imposter syndrome that
   affect different people. Specific situations such as a promotion can
   also bring on feelings of self-doubt.

   Knowing and properly identifying with the right kind of imposter
   syndrome you currently suffer from could be the key to working through
   it a little more easily.

Different types of imposter syndrome

   Some estimates say that 70pc of the population experience imposter
   syndrome at some point in their lives, but not all experiences are the
   same.

   Fast Company had an excellent piece last year on the five types of
   imposter syndrome according to imposter syndrome expert Dr Valerie
   Young, including perfectionists, workaholics and so-called ‘natural
   geniuses’.

   In brief, perfectionists set ridiculously high standards for themselves
   and then feel like failures when they don’t reach them.

   The superman or superwoman of the office always feels like they’re
   playing catch-up with their other colleagues and therefore resorts to
   overworking.

   Natural geniuses are similar to perfectionists, with impossibly high
   standards. However, they also expect to get everything right on the
   first try.

   The individualist feels like they are an imposter if they need to ask
   for help.

   Finally, the expert is the one we are probably most familiar with:
   someone who believes they somehow tricked their employer into getting a
   job they have no right to because they never feel truly qualified
   enough.

Diversity and imposter syndrome

   We should all know by now the importance of diversity and inclusion in
   the workplace. Aside from the societal and representational importance
   of having a diverse set of voices, thought processes and opinions at
   the table, there is another side that must be addressed.

   Imposter syndrome can come into play in a very particular way for
   women, minorities or LGBTQ individuals. Someone who doesn’t match the
   majority of a group or culture can often succumb to imposter syndrome
   despite their qualifications and abilities.

   A lack of role models or mentors can play a part in this, as those in a
   minority who are wondering if they even deserve to be there have no one
   to turn to or look up to.

   Furthermore, negative stereotypes about diversity initiatives and
   gender quotas can lead people to believe that, despite all of their
   achievements, qualifications and experience, others will think they are
   there due to tokenism, and not based on merit.

   These negative connotations can often seep into their own mind and so,
   imposter syndrome begins to fester. In a feature written last year for
   ASBMB Today, two underrepresented minority students spoke about how the
   notion of being part of some sort of diversity quota led to both of
   them suffering from imposter syndrome.

Promotions

   What differentiates imposter syndrome from low self-esteem is the
   trajectory. The more successful you become and the higher up the career
   ladder you climb, the more likely imposter syndrome is to present
   itself.

   A promotion is one of the most common situations that can bring about a
   sudden wave of imposter syndrome, even if you hadn’t felt it up until
   that point.

   Once new responsibilities and jobs come into the fray, so too do new
   doubts, worries and feelings of inadequacy for the job at hand. ‘I was
   comfortable in my own job, I knew what I was doing. I had a manager to
   ask for help. Now, I am the manager and in way over my head.’ Sound
   familiar? That’s because you’re not alone.

   People who are promoted can often feel like they were simply in the
   right place at the right time, and that the promotion has nothing to do
   with merit. But the fact is, employers don’t promote someone simply
   because they’re the easiest choice. They still have to be the best
   choice.

   If you believe in your employer’s judge of character and their ability
   to do their job, then you must believe that you would not be able to
   pull the wool over their eyes and secure a promotion that you didn’t
   deserve. If you find it hard to trust that you’re good at your job, at
   least trust that they’re good at theirs.

Talk to your boss

   Whether it’s because you fall into one of the five common types of
   imposter syndrome sufferers listed above, or you feel your imposter
   syndrome is a product of a particular situation, it’s important not to
   let it fester.

   Feeling like an imposter is not just detrimental to your own mental
   health – side effects such as being afraid to make a mistake, speak up
   about an idea or ask for help are just some of the things that can
   really affect your performance at work.

   If you’re suffering from imposter syndrome, it’s a good idea to talk to
   your manager about it. Ask for guidance on elements of your job that
   specifically make you feel intimidated. It’s OK not to know what you’re
   doing all of the time.

   And, statistically speaking, it’s highly likely that your boss has
   experienced the same feeling at some point in their own career.

Users are downloading Windows 10 whether they want to or not

   It turns out that, even if you hadn’t asked for it, the odds are your
   non-Apple computer has already downloaded Windows 10 — to save time.

   The automatic Windows 10 download can happen without you knowing, lying
   dormant on your machine until you seek to make the switch.

   The download is between 3.5Gb to 6Gb in size, creating a ‘$Windows.~BT’
   folder on your system, as revealed by The Inquirer.

   That kind of file size can cause problems if you’re running close to
   your capacity, or your computer only has, say, 32Gb to play with in the
   first place.

   But Microsoft claims this is for brevity, getting things in order for
   people to upgrade in a timely fashion.

   “For individuals who have chosen to receive automatic updates through
   Windows Update, we help upgradable devices get ready for Windows 10 by
   downloading the files they’ll need if they decide to upgrade,” said the
   company in a statement.

   “When the upgrade is ready, the customer will be prompted to install
   Windows 10 on the device.”

   It’s a little odd, in that automatic updates are usually reserved for
   patches and bug fixes. In this instance an entire OS is landing on your
   machine, lying in wait.

   Microsoft is understandably keen to see as many people upgrade to its
   new toy as possible, with 75m upgrading within a month.

   It has received largely favourable reviews, too, but it’s still awful
   presumptuous of Microsoft to think everyone will happily take the
   plunge.

   After the change between Windows 7 and Windows 8 became less and less
   appealing to users, blanket support for an immediate, unsolicited
   change vanished.

   It’s weird, although not as weird as the old way Microsoft encouraged
   you to upgrade:

   In his look back on the past week, Siliconrepublic editor John Kennedy
   concedes that from a social-media perspective, everything pales this
   week in comparison to the Irish financial bailout. Even the Beatles
   arriving on iTunes failed to move him.

   You know there’s a joke doing the rounds on Twitter this morning. It
   goes: "Breaking News: Steve Jobs is to buy Ireland to solve the debt
   problem. It will be rebranded iLand."

   Well, I suppose it’s better than the Iceland joke that did the rounds
   when the banking crisis began to unravel.

   Social media is really becoming the bellwether for people’s feelings,
   jocular or angry or otherwise, on the matter and during the times
   that’s in it let’s look at how people are tracking and handling it.

   It’s a pity not enough Irish politicians have embraced social media
   because if they really wanted to understand people’s mindsets around
   this time, Twitter and Facebook sum it up pretty well.

   On Twitter, hashtags such as #bailout and #imf give a fairly good
   picture but it’s usually during Prime Time (#rtept) that tempers really
   hot up. Seriously, it’s worth watching and contributing if you have
   something to say.

   On Facebook, the sudden omission of Vincent Browne’s questions on RTE
   last night apparently for technical reasons has led to the launch of a
   campaign against alleged censorship while another Facebook campaign
   calling for a general election has 10,000 fans and intends to reach
   50,000.

   While the drama of the EU/IMF bailout will no doubt unfold in
   newspapers and on our airwaves, it would be wise to start paying
   attention to what people are saying and thinking on forums like Twitter
   and Facebook; it is visceral and raw and the people commenting aren’t
   just technology people, they increasingly consist of well-known
   broadcasters, legal professionals and frankly, a broadening walk of
   life.

   So, where were you?

   Personally, I envy people who can spend long lengths of time on either
   Twitter or Facebook, I’m usually drawn between using it as a work tool
   for research and sharing stories.

   But keeping an eye on these forums in the midst of unprecedented
   historical events is also an opportunity to put a personal stamp on
   them, too.

   Facebook has in excess of 500 million users and Twitter has 160 million
   and counting. Who knows what social media platforms (will we even call
   them such) will dominate in the years to come as internet comes to TV
   and mobile devices take on the attributes of supercomputers. Some 1.3
   million Irish people are on Facebook and it emerged this morning that
   one-fifth of Irish people carry a smartphone. The opportunities to
   speak are accelerating in pace.

Watermark for our times

   But, as many of us who have felt the powerful impact of being able to
   check through the records of things like the 1901 census and seeing
   where and how relatives lived, signed their names and earned their
   livings, who’s to say that the views and opinions of people at a
   particular point in history can’t be found decades from now.

   People used to ask questions like, "Do you know what your grandparents
   were doing in 1916?" People used to say they would always remember
   where they were when JFK was shot or during the horrible events of 911.

   For better or worse, tools like Facebook or Twitter could give a nice
   insight into what people were saying and thinking during pivotal events
   like the EU/IMF intervention in the Irish economy. This could leave a
   valuable resource for future generations, it could be a call to action,
   but whatever it is, it’s as mesmerising as it is magical.

   I waited years for The Beatles to finally make it to iTunes, but
   frankly, I knew where my eyes were glued during a tumultuous week in
   Dublin in late November 2010.
