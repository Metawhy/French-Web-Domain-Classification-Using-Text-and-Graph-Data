   Senses is an ongoing research and performance project that brings
   together music- and movement-based improvisation with motion-sensitive
   live electronics. The goal of Senses is to produce performance
   environments that explore the relationships between movement and sound
   through human-human interaction and human-computer interaction.
   Variations of Senses have been performed with solo improvisors,
   dancer/musician duos, and small improvising chamber ensembles.

   Program notes:
   Naked to the Sky is a performance scored for circus artist, violin,
   saxophone, piano, percussion, and motion-sensitive live electronics.
   This work invistigates the fluctuation of identity, control, and
   influence. Through the use of movement-lead improvisation and motion
   sensors, analog and digital relationships are formed between the circus
   artist and the musicians, creating an inter-directed multi-dimensional
   force. Through these two dynamic connections, the choreographed
   movements of the artist will influence the musicians’ playing and the
   electronic manipulation of the acoustic sound. These connections evolve
   throughout of the piece, creating a complex cross-modal web of
   entanglements and ambiguities.

   Program note:
   Made from 100% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo grapes, grown in hillside
   vineyards near the Adriatic coast of Abruzzo. The grapes are harvested
   from August-September, de- stemmed, crushed, and fermented in stainless
   steel tanks to preserve juiciness and softness.
   Bright ruby-red in color, with delicious aromas of black cherries,
   strawberries, and herbs, the Bath Clown Duo is dry and mellow with
   concentrated structure. It is best enjoyed young, in order to fully
   appreciate its fruity varietal character. Enjoy with typical Italian
   dishes, red meats, pizza and cheese.

   (BUTTON) Filthy Peaks, for amplified violoncello and electronics, ca.
   11’ (click for video)

   Commissioned by Juan Sebastian Delgado
   Premiere: Juan Sebastian Delgado, Café Résonance, Montréal, Canada,
   April 28, 2015.
   Program note:
   Filthy Peaks is a composition in three main sections, with the second
   section serving as a transition between the first and the third.
   The first section consists of four loops. Here, the cellist performs
   similar gestures across each loop using four distinct objects to excite
   the instrument. They begin with pieces of wax paper, move on to
   chopsticks, later to a milk-frother, and finally, the bow. The
   soundworld is transformed as a byproduct of the unfolding relationship
   between the objects used to make the gestures and the physical gestures
   themselves.
   The final section recontextualizes the material presented in the first.
   Originally, the gesturally-rooted noise-based sounds of the first
   section are introduced in a non-pulsed environment, occupying the
   foreground of the sonic field. In the third section, they coalesce into
   techno-seque energy-charged grooves over which the cello plays
   virtuosically.

   Scott Rubin (b.1989) is a interdisciplinary musician and improvising
   violist whose work interrogates relationships between sound and
   movement through analog and digital means. His recent projects have
   involved interdisciplinary collaborations with musicians and dancers,
   often incorporating interactive acoustic/electronic improvisation,
   expanded performance practices, motion-sensors, and live video. In
   these projects, he engages themes of intimacy, control, and the
   sublime.
   Scott’s music has been played around the world by the Nouvel Ensemble
   Moderne, Ensemble Paramirabo, Quasar Quatuor de saxophones, Tenth
   Intervention, TAK Ensemble, UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra, cellist

   Collective, Inverted Space Ensemble, Eco Ensemble, Duo d’Entre Deux,
   Eventuell Saxophone Duo, Phoenix Quartet, Splinter Reeds, the Estrella
   Consort, Ensemble Gô, the McGill University Contemporary Music
   Ensemble, Ensemble Arkea, and the University of Illinois New Music
   Ensemble.
   Scott has collaborated with dancers/choreographers Yuri Shimaoka,
   Christine Bonansea, Sarah Xiao, Manu Cyr, Louis Barbier, and Shoshana
   Green on projects staged in Berlin, New York City, Hong Kong, Toronto,

   workshops with Neue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart, Klangforum Wien, Ensemble
   Intercontemporain, Ensemble Transmission, the Danish String Quartet,
   and Meitar Ensemble.
   Currently, Scott is a PhD student at the University of the California
   at Berkeley where he studies with Ken Ueno, Franck Bedrossian, Myra
   Melford, Edmund Campion, and Cindy Cox. He is an active researcher at
   the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies.
   He recently earned his masters degree studying with Philippe Leroux at
   McGill University in Montréal, Canada. Previously, he earned a Bachelor
   of Music in music composition and a Bachelor of Science in psychology
   at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where his primary
   teachers were Reynold Tharp, Philipp Blume, and Stephen Taylor. Scott
   was also a student in the Experimental Music Studios, under the
   tutelage of Scott A. Wyatt.
   At McGill, Scott worked as a composer for the Auditory Cognitive
   Neuroscience Lab under Robert Zatorre, where he composes music to be
   used in music cognition experiments. Scott has studied music cognition
   with Stephen McAdams and Caroline Palmer. He has also studied with Mark
   Jude Tramo at the Institute for Music and Brain Science.
   Scott is co-founder and co-organizer for the Montréal Contemporary
   Music Lab. This is a week-long performance and composition workshop
   that focuses on the creation of new music through fostering
   collaborative relationships between performers and composers. He also
   performs improvised guitar for Speakeasy Electro Swing Montreal.
   His awards include the McGill University Graduate Excellence
   Fellowship, the Florence Gould Foundation Scholarship from the European
