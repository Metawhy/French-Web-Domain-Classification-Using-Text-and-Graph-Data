   The Origin Point Of Antarctica's Blood Falls Has Been Revealed

   The Blood Falls of Antarctica are weird, but not inexplicable. Tumbling
   out of the Taylor Glacier, they aren’t a sign of the coming apocalypse
   or the Rapture – it’s a form of meltwater that is tainted by iron
   oxide, essentially rust, that ekes out of small fissures in the ice.

   The color was initially thought to have come from red algae, which
   certainly does exist – however, it could be explained by a strange
   quirk of geochemistry, where iron particles in unfrozen saltwater
   become oxidized when they flow up the surface and make contact with the
   atmosphere.

   The bewitching Blood Falls were discovered for the first time all the
   way back in 1911, but the genesis and the path of the source river
   remained shrouded in mystery for generations. The former, clearly, has
   been solved, and now it looks like the latter has been too.

   According to a new study in the Journal of Glaciology, it appears that
   the red river first emerges from a saltwater lake trapped beneath the
   1.5-4-million-year-old Taylor Glacier. The team led by Colorado College
   and the University of Alaska Fairbanks spotted the source of the
   crimson brine using penetrating radar methods to see through the thick
   layers of overlying ice.

   Far from there being just a single concealed river, it appears Taylor
   Glacier is sitting atop a complex network of them, all acting as a
   drainage system in unison. The brine appears to be injected into the
   ice, and forced up to the Blood Falls through cracks, under immense
   pressure.

   Saltwater has a lower freezing point than freshwater, but the glacier’s
   temperatures are so low that researchers have been puzzled as to how
   it’s managing to flow through it without solidifying. This new study
   explains that the saltwater releases latent heat as it freezes, which
   melts the surrounding ice and allows it to quickly flow through.

   This makes Taylor Glacier the coldest glacier on Earth to feature
   constantly flowing water. More significantly, this means that Blood
   Falls are at least a million years old, perhaps older.

   ^Modeling shows that the brine is forcing its way through the Taylor
   Glacier through multiple paths, all the way up to Blood Falls
   (magnified, inset). Badgeley et al./Journal of Glaciology

   Thanks to scientific curiosity, the mystery of Blood Falls is being
   stripped away year by year, but this peculiar phenomenon’s inherent
   weirdness looks set to become more pronounced over time. For example, a
   rather strange microbial system, one that makes use of the sulfates and
   iron oxides present in the water to produce energy, has also been
   detected in Blood Falls.

   Back in 2009, researchers clocked at least 17 different varieties of
   microbes all living in an essentially deoxygenated environment, and
   several of them use energy-production processes that were previously
   unknown to science. So Blood Falls, an extremely strange place, has
   actual extremophiles living in it.

   Great Apes Have Just Passed A Complex 'Theory Of Mind' Test

   What separates humans from “the beasts” of nature? One of the few
   standout features of human intelligence is often argued to be our
   ability to deeply understand the desires, knowledge, motives, and
   intents of others. Known as “theory of mind”, this ability allows us to
   understand and anticipate the thoughts of others, even when they are
   different or opposed to one’s own.

   Many have pushed the idea that humans are the only creatures to possess
   this complex ability, however, a new study on our closest evolutionary
   cousins is now shaking this longheld assumption.

   Reporting their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
   Sciences, an international team of researchers from Kyoto University in
   Japan, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in
   Germany, and the University of St Andrews in Scotland has demonstrated
   that other members of the great ape family – including chimpanzees,
   bonobos, and orangutans – appear to possess “theory of mind.”

   While this is not the first study to argue this, the new research
   builds on the team's previous work to provide some of the most
   convincing arguments yet.

   They reached this conclusion through a series of experiments on 47
   captive great apes – 29 chimpanzees, 14 bonobos, and four orangutans –
   at sanctuaries in Japan and Germany.

   In the first test, the ape observed a film that showed a human actor
   being tricked into thinking an object was hidden in a box. After the
   human watched the object be put in the box, they went behind a screen,
   after which the object was moved. So, the ape knew the object was not
   in the box, but the human still thought it was there. Using
   eye-tracking technology to record their gaze, it appeared that the ape
   anticipated the human’s false belief that the object was still in the
   box (even though they were aware it was not).

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/oPPloZynLNg

   To dig deeper into whether this displayed true “theory of mind”, they
   set up another scenario that was a little bit more confusing. The apes
   were randomly split into two groups and familiarized with one of two
   types of screen: a barrier made of an opaque material and a “trick”
   barrier (one which appears to be opaque from a distance but becomes
   transparent up close).

   The apes watched a new film with the same premise as the first, but
   with the two new screens at play. As expected, the apes who were used
   to the opaque barrier anticipated that the human would search for the
   object under the box where it was last seen. However, the other apes
   were able to anticipate that the human would go to neither location, as
   the object had been removed entirely, and both parties were aware of
   this.

   This sharp ability to predict the actions of someone else – even taking
   into account their different perspectives, knowledge, and intent –
   shows a remarkable level of intelligence and, according to the team,
   provides evidence that apes possess “theory of mind.”

   “We are excited to find that great apes actually passed this difficult
   test," study author Fumihiro Kano, of Kyoto University's Kumamoto
   Sanctuary and Primate Research Institute, said in a statement. "The
   results suggest that we share this ability with our evolutionary
   cousins. We plan to continue refining our methods to test further
   non-mentalistic alternatives to the theory of mind in nonhuman
   animals."

   More than a handful of muscles that "disappeared" more than 250 million
   years ago have been found – not in gym-buff humans but in embryos
   during their first couple of months curled in their mother's womb.
   Evolution is as complex as it is beautiful, but it is evidence likes
   this that points a finger to a legacy of changes throughout the history
   of life on Earth.

   The team managed to capture the process using a new technology that
   creates high-resolution 3D images from immunostained embryos and
   fetuses within the first trimester of gestation. They found that at 7
   weeks of gestation (when the fetus is the size of a blueberry), there
   are around 30 muscles in the hand. By week 13 (size of a lemon), 10 of
   them are fused and the number of muscles drop to 20. A select few of
   these even disappeared during the transition from reptiles to mammals.

   "It used to be that we had more understanding of the early development
   of fishes, frogs, chicken and mice than in our own species, but these
   new techniques allow us to see human development in much greater
   detail," said Dr Rui Diogo, from Howard University, in a statement.
   "What is fascinating is that we observed various muscles that have
   never been described in human prenatal development, and that some of
   these atavistic muscles were seen even in 11.5-week-old fetuses, which
   is strikingly late for developmental atavisms."

   The team were able to capture a detailed timetable of the appearance of
   these muscles, as well as their splitting, fusion, or loss during the
   growth and development of the embryo. The muscles that fused are called
   atavistic limb muscles, formed during early human development and then
   gone prior to our shrieking entrance into the world. It provides an
   interesting view on evolution – we often see ourselves as becoming
   progressively more complex, but some anatomical features streamline and
   become more simple.

   "It is in fact instead a story of anatomical simplification," Dr Diogo
   told IFLScience. "Mainly muscles are lost, bones are lost.. an adult
   human has in fact less muscles and bones in the body, in total, than an
   adult mice, or an adult lizard."

   "Interestingly, some of the atavistic muscles are found on rare
   occasions in adults, either as anatomical variations without any
   noticeable effect for the healthy individual, or as the result of
   congenital malformations," added Diogo, who is lead author of the study
   published in the journal Development.

   One example of an atavistic muscle found in adults is opponens digiti
   minimi of the foot. It is present in apes, helping them move their
   feet with a moble, precise big toe. Humans lost such a digit in
   evolution, but it's present in embryos and, on rare occasions, as an
   anomaly in humans.

   "This reinforces the idea that both muscle variations and pathologies
   can be related to delayed or arrested embryonic development, in this
   case perhaps a delay or decrease of muscle apoptosis, and helps to
   explain why these muscles are occasionally found in adult people. It
   provides a fascinating, powerful example of evolution at play."

   They also found “a striking difference” in the order of muscle
   development in the arms versus legs, suggesting the similarity is
   derived. "It means that what most people assume, that the similarities
   between the upper limb and lower limb are due to an ancestral
   similarity of these two regions of the body, is likely not true: the
   similarity of the upper and lower limbs actually became more prominent
   during the evolution of these limbs, than it was in the first fish with
   pectoral and pelvic fins, from which the upper and lower limbs arose,
   respectively."

   NASA Chief Scientist: “We’re Close To Finding Life On Mars But We’re
   Not Ready”

   Is there life on Mars? A question everyone from Carl Sagan to HG Wells
   to Bowie has sought the answer to – and we may finally be close to
   getting an answer, but the world is not ready for it, according to
   NASA’s chief scientist.

   Next year, two planned missions to send rovers to Mars will drill deep
   into the surface in the search for extraterrestrial life, which means
   we could find out the answer in the next couple of years. If we are
   successful it will be “revolutionary,” but we’re not prepared for this
   momentous occasion, Dr Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science
   Division, warned.

   “I’ve been worried about that because I think we’re close to finding it
   and making some announcements,” Dr Green said in an interview with The
   Sunday Telegraph. “It will start a whole new line of thinking. I don’t
   think we’re prepared for the results.”

   In 2020, Earth and Mars will be at a close approach, opening a prime
   window for mission launches, something that five space agencies are
   taking advantage of. China and the United Arabic Emirates are preparing
   for their first trips, launching an orbiter and rover, and an orbiter,
   respectively.

   NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with Russia’s
   Roscosmos are both sending rovers to drill for samples, hoping to find
   organic matter. NASA’s Mars 2020 rover will drill into rock formations
   to collect samples and send them back to Earth – the first time
   material from Mars will visit our planet. ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover
   will also drill for samples, crushing up and analyzing them in
   Roscosmos' stationary surface laboratory while there.

   Dr Green thinks both could be successful, and if they are it would be
   akin to Copernicus stating in the 1500s that Earth goes around the Sun,
   not the other way around, and how after that we had to reconsider
   everything we knew. Which is why he thinks Earth is not prepared for
   what happens if we do.

   “What happens next is a whole new set of scientific questions. Is that
   life like us? How are we related? Can life move from planet to planet
   or do we have a spark and just the right environment and that spark
   generates life – like us or not like us – based on the chemical
   environment that it is in?” he said.

   NASA’s Mars 2020 rover is due to land on the Red Planet's surface on
   February 18, 2021, with ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover arriving one
   month later in March 2021. Both are searching in the vicinity of an
   ancient lake or ocean bed that once held water – so crucial for life –
   and may now be rich in clay. NASA's chosen landing site is the Jezero
   Crater delta, a 49-kilometer-wide (30-mile) crater once thought to have
   been flooded with water, and now a clay-rich delta. The ExoMars mission
   hasn't finalized its landing site yet but it announced last year its
   preferred site is Oxia Planum, a site rich in iron-magnesium clay, a
   sign water was once present.

   Mars is not the only place with the potential to have once held
   water, including places scientists hadn't thought possible before. It
   was recently revealed that Venus, Earth's hellish twin, may have once
   had water 3 billion years ago before its atmosphere became incredibly
   dense and hot 700 million years ago.

   “There is no reason to think that there isn’t civilisations elsewhere,
   because we are finding exoplanets all over the place," Dr Green
   said. “This concept of what a ‘Goldilocks Zone’ looks like has to be
   modified.”

   The Origin Point Of Antarctica's Blood Falls Has Been Revealed

   The Blood Falls of Antarctica are weird, but not inexplicable. Tumbling
   out of the Taylor Glacier, they aren’t a sign of the coming apocalypse
   or the Rapture – it’s a form of meltwater that is tainted by iron
   oxide, essentially rust, that ekes out of small fissures in the ice.

   The color was initially thought to have come from red algae, which
   certainly does exist – however, it could be explained by a strange
   quirk of geochemistry, where iron particles in unfrozen saltwater
   become oxidized when they flow up the surface and make contact with the
   atmosphere.

   The bewitching Blood Falls were discovered for the first time all the
   way back in 1911, but the genesis and the path of the source river
   remained shrouded in mystery for generations. The former, clearly, has
   been solved, and now it looks like the latter has been too.

   According to a new study in the Journal of Glaciology, it appears that
   the red river first emerges from a saltwater lake trapped beneath the
   1.5-4-million-year-old Taylor Glacier. The team led by Colorado College
   and the University of Alaska Fairbanks spotted the source of the
   crimson brine using penetrating radar methods to see through the thick
   layers of overlying ice.

   Far from there being just a single concealed river, it appears Taylor
   Glacier is sitting atop a complex network of them, all acting as a
   drainage system in unison. The brine appears to be injected into the
   ice, and forced up to the Blood Falls through cracks, under immense
   pressure.

   Saltwater has a lower freezing point than freshwater, but the glacier’s
   temperatures are so low that researchers have been puzzled as to how
   it’s managing to flow through it without solidifying. This new study
   explains that the saltwater releases latent heat as it freezes, which
   melts the surrounding ice and allows it to quickly flow through.

   This makes Taylor Glacier the coldest glacier on Earth to feature
   constantly flowing water. More significantly, this means that Blood
   Falls are at least a million years old, perhaps older.

   ^Modeling shows that the brine is forcing its way through the Taylor
   Glacier through multiple paths, all the way up to Blood Falls
   (magnified, inset). Badgeley et al./Journal of Glaciology

   Thanks to scientific curiosity, the mystery of Blood Falls is being
   stripped away year by year, but this peculiar phenomenon’s inherent
   weirdness looks set to become more pronounced over time. For example, a
   rather strange microbial system, one that makes use of the sulfates and
   iron oxides present in the water to produce energy, has also been
   detected in Blood Falls.

   Back in 2009, researchers clocked at least 17 different varieties of
   microbes all living in an essentially deoxygenated environment, and
   several of them use energy-production processes that were previously
   unknown to science. So Blood Falls, an extremely strange place, has
   actual extremophiles living in it.

   Great Apes Have Just Passed A Complex 'Theory Of Mind' Test

   What separates humans from “the beasts” of nature? One of the few
   standout features of human intelligence is often argued to be our
   ability to deeply understand the desires, knowledge, motives, and
   intents of others. Known as “theory of mind”, this ability allows us to
   understand and anticipate the thoughts of others, even when they are
   different or opposed to one’s own.

   Many have pushed the idea that humans are the only creatures to possess
   this complex ability, however, a new study on our closest evolutionary
   cousins is now shaking this longheld assumption.

   Reporting their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
   Sciences, an international team of researchers from Kyoto University in
   Japan, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in
   Germany, and the University of St Andrews in Scotland has demonstrated
   that other members of the great ape family – including chimpanzees,
   bonobos, and orangutans – appear to possess “theory of mind.”

   While this is not the first study to argue this, the new research
   builds on the team's previous work to provide some of the most
   convincing arguments yet.

   They reached this conclusion through a series of experiments on 47
   captive great apes – 29 chimpanzees, 14 bonobos, and four orangutans –
   at sanctuaries in Japan and Germany.

   In the first test, the ape observed a film that showed a human actor
   being tricked into thinking an object was hidden in a box. After the
   human watched the object be put in the box, they went behind a screen,
   after which the object was moved. So, the ape knew the object was not
   in the box, but the human still thought it was there. Using
   eye-tracking technology to record their gaze, it appeared that the ape
   anticipated the human’s false belief that the object was still in the
   box (even though they were aware it was not).

   To dig deeper into whether this displayed true “theory of mind”, they
   set up another scenario that was a little bit more confusing. The apes
   were randomly split into two groups and familiarized with one of two
   types of screen: a barrier made of an opaque material and a “trick”
   barrier (one which appears to be opaque from a distance but becomes
   transparent up close).

   The apes watched a new film with the same premise as the first, but
   with the two new screens at play. As expected, the apes who were used
   to the opaque barrier anticipated that the human would search for the
   object under the box where it was last seen. However, the other apes
   were able to anticipate that the human would go to neither location, as
   the object had been removed entirely, and both parties were aware of
   this.

   This sharp ability to predict the actions of someone else – even taking
   into account their different perspectives, knowledge, and intent –
   shows a remarkable level of intelligence and, according to the team,
   provides evidence that apes possess “theory of mind.”

   “We are excited to find that great apes actually passed this difficult
   test," study author Fumihiro Kano, of Kyoto University's Kumamoto
   Sanctuary and Primate Research Institute, said in a statement. "The
   results suggest that we share this ability with our evolutionary
   cousins. We plan to continue refining our methods to test further
   non-mentalistic alternatives to the theory of mind in nonhuman
   animals."

   More than a handful of muscles that "disappeared" more than 250 million
   years ago have been found – not in gym-buff humans but in embryos
   during their first couple of months curled in their mother's womb.
   Evolution is as complex as it is beautiful, but it is evidence likes
   this that points a finger to a legacy of changes throughout the history
   of life on Earth.

   The team managed to capture the process using a new technology that
   creates high-resolution 3D images from immunostained embryos and
   fetuses within the first trimester of gestation. They found that at 7
   weeks of gestation (when the fetus is the size of a blueberry), there
   are around 30 muscles in the hand. By week 13 (size of a lemon), 10 of
   them are fused and the number of muscles drop to 20. A select few of
   these even disappeared during the transition from reptiles to mammals.

   "It used to be that we had more understanding of the early development
   of fishes, frogs, chicken and mice than in our own species, but these
   new techniques allow us to see human development in much greater
   detail," said Dr Rui Diogo, from Howard University, in a statement.
   "What is fascinating is that we observed various muscles that have
   never been described in human prenatal development, and that some of
   these atavistic muscles were seen even in 11.5-week-old fetuses, which
   is strikingly late for developmental atavisms."

   The team were able to capture a detailed timetable of the appearance of
   these muscles, as well as their splitting, fusion, or loss during the
   growth and development of the embryo. The muscles that fused are called
   atavistic limb muscles, formed during early human development and then
   gone prior to our shrieking entrance into the world. It provides an
   interesting view on evolution – we often see ourselves as becoming
   progressively more complex, but some anatomical features streamline and
   become more simple.

   "It is in fact instead a story of anatomical simplification," Dr Diogo
   told IFLScience. "Mainly muscles are lost, bones are lost.. an adult
   human has in fact less muscles and bones in the body, in total, than an
   adult mice, or an adult lizard."

   "Interestingly, some of the atavistic muscles are found on rare
   occasions in adults, either as anatomical variations without any
   noticeable effect for the healthy individual, or as the result of
   congenital malformations," added Diogo, who is lead author of the study
   published in the journal Development.

   One example of an atavistic muscle found in adults is opponens digiti
   minimi of the foot. It is present in apes, helping them move their
   feet with a moble, precise big toe. Humans lost such a digit in
   evolution, but it's present in embryos and, on rare occasions, as an
   anomaly in humans.

   "This reinforces the idea that both muscle variations and pathologies
   can be related to delayed or arrested embryonic development, in this
   case perhaps a delay or decrease of muscle apoptosis, and helps to
   explain why these muscles are occasionally found in adult people. It
   provides a fascinating, powerful example of evolution at play."

   They also found “a striking difference” in the order of muscle
   development in the arms versus legs, suggesting the similarity is
   derived. "It means that what most people assume, that the similarities
   between the upper limb and lower limb are due to an ancestral
   similarity of these two regions of the body, is likely not true: the
   similarity of the upper and lower limbs actually became more prominent
   during the evolution of these limbs, than it was in the first fish with
   pectoral and pelvic fins, from which the upper and lower limbs arose,
   respectively."

   NASA Chief Scientist: “We’re Close To Finding Life On Mars But We’re

   Is there life on Mars? A question everyone from Carl Sagan to HG Wells
   to Bowie has sought the answer to – and we may finally be close to
   getting an answer, but the world is not ready for it, according to
   NASA’s chief scientist.

   Next year, two planned missions to send rovers to Mars will drill deep
   into the surface in the search for extraterrestrial life, which means
   we could find out the answer in the next couple of years. If we are
   successful it will be “revolutionary,” but we’re not prepared for this
   momentous occasion, Dr Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science
   Division, warned.

   “I’ve been worried about that because I think we’re close to finding it
   and making some announcements,” Dr Green said in an interview with The
   Sunday Telegraph. “It will start a whole new line of thinking. I don’t
   think we’re prepared for the results.”

   In 2020, Earth and Mars will be at a close approach, opening a prime
   window for mission launches, something that five space agencies are
   taking advantage of. China and the United Arabic Emirates are preparing
   for their first trips, launching an orbiter and rover, and an orbiter,
   respectively.

   NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with Russia’s
   Roscosmos are both sending rovers to drill for samples, hoping to find
   organic matter. NASA’s Mars 2020 rover will drill into rock formations
   to collect samples and send them back to Earth – the first time
   material from Mars will visit our planet. ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover
   will also drill for samples, crushing up and analyzing them in
   Roscosmos' stationary surface laboratory while there.

   Dr Green thinks both could be successful, and if they are it would be
   akin to Copernicus stating in the 1500s that Earth goes around the Sun,
   not the other way around, and how after that we had to reconsider
   everything we knew. Which is why he thinks Earth is not prepared for
   what happens if we do.

   “What happens next is a whole new set of scientific questions. Is that
   life like us? How are we related? Can life move from planet to planet
   or do we have a spark and just the right environment and that spark
   generates life – like us or not like us – based on the chemical
   environment that it is in?” he said.

   NASA’s Mars 2020 rover is due to land on the Red Planet's surface on
   February 18, 2021, with ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover arriving one
   month later in March 2021. Both are searching in the vicinity of an
   ancient lake or ocean bed that once held water – so crucial for life –
   and may now be rich in clay. NASA's chosen landing site is the Jezero
   Crater delta, a 49-kilometer-wide (30-mile) crater once thought to have
   been flooded with water, and now a clay-rich delta. The ExoMars mission
   hasn't finalized its landing site yet but it announced last year its
   preferred site is Oxia Planum, a site rich in iron-magnesium clay, a
   sign water was once present.

   Mars is not the only place with the potential to have once held
   water, including places scientists hadn't thought possible before. It
   was recently revealed that Venus, Earth's hellish twin, may have once
   had water 3 billion years ago before its atmosphere became incredibly
   dense and hot 700 million years ago.

   “There is no reason to think that there isn’t civilisations elsewhere,
   because we are finding exoplanets all over the place," Dr Green
   said. “This concept of what a ‘Goldilocks Zone’ looks like has to be
   modified.”

   God-Fearing Family Hid Impressive Ichthyosaurus Fossil For Over A
   Century

   A God-fearing family in Victorian England buried a giant Ichthyosaurus
   fossil out of concern it could threaten their Christian beliefs. Now,
   after some 150 years and a change of heart, the family has unearthed
   the stunning prehistoric fossil.

   The Ichthyosaurus fossil was discovered in 1850 by the family of cider
   brandy maker Julian Temperley in Somerset, England. Local paper Burnham
   & Highbridge Weekly News reports the family were builders' merchants at
   the time and unearthed the relic while digging in a quarry.

   After returning the fossil to their home, the family decided to bury it
   as they didn’t want to feel they were “denying God” and the creation
   story by displaying it. After all, this was several years before
   Charles Darwin published the bible of evolution by natural selection,
   On the Origin of Species.

   Temperley recalls regularly unearthing the fossil as a child with his
   family, however, it was always reburied after they caught a good
   glimpse. When the Somerset Levels were hit by severe flooding in the
   winter of 2013 to 2014, he finally decided it was time to unearth the
   beast for good.

   "Whenever we visited Somerset as kids, we dug it up and were generally
   amazed,” Temperley told Western Morning News.
   One of the most famous ichthyosaurus fossils - Mary Anning's
   ichthyosaurus - on display at the Natural History Museum in London.

   "But after the flooding of 2013-14 we realized it was not a good idea
   to leave it buried and I thought we ought to look after it."

   He employed the help of professional fossil collector Chris Moore to
   excavate the fossil and clear it up. By all accounts, it’s a pretty
   impressive specimen. An image of the so-called Temperley Ichthyosaurus
   is also set to get on the label of Temperley’s cider brandy.

   Ichthyosaurus, meaning “fish lizard”, is a genus of ichthyosaur, a
   diverse group of extinct marine reptile that resembled a dolphin-like
   lizard. Some of the earliest fossils were discovered in the early 19th
   century by the English palaeontologist and fossil-finding maestro Mary
   Anning. The largest discovered specimen of an Ichthyosaurus, unearthed
   in the mid-1990s, measured between 3 and 3.5 meters (10 and 11.5 feet)
   in length, although most species were small.

   The ichthyosaurs were arguably one of the most successful lineages
   ever. They occupied a wide variety of niches and were very widely
   distributed, leaving behind fossil remains that span most of the
   Mesozoic Era (251 million to 65.5 million years ago).

   What a beauty. Christina Koch/NASA

   In an image that looks more fantastical than real, NASA astronaut
   Christina Koch snapped a photograph of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft
   with her best friend on board as it hurtled towards the International
   Space Station after blasting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in
   Kazakhstan.

   "What it looks like from @Space_Station when your best friend achieves
   her lifelong dream to go to space. Caught the second stage in progress!
   We can’t wait to welcome you onboard, crew of Soyuz 61!" she tweeted.
   -

   The friend she speaks of is flight engineer Jessica Meir, who arrived
   with her colleagues – Oleg Skripochka and Hazzaa Ali Almansoori – on
   the orbital outpost six hours after launch. This is Meir’s first launch
   into space, where she will live aboard the space station until spring
   2020, helping her crewmates with around 250 research experiments,
   according to NASA.

   Christina Koch is currently aboard the space station as part of
   Expedition 59, 60, and now 61. She is expected to set the women's
   record for longest single spaceflight with 328 days in space.

   The luminous sphere and squiggle above the curve of Earth's horizon is
   the exhaust from the initial rocket. The launch is Expedition 61, where
   crew members will perform a series of spacewalks to install new
   lithium-ion batteries for solar array power channels on the ISS. They
   will also repair the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer that helps researchers
   study dark matter and, you know, just the origins of the universe.

   Andrew Morgan, a NASA astronaut currently aboard the ISS who previously
   worked as an emergency physician in the US Army, also tweeted: “All six
   members of #Expedition60 packed into the cupola, our window on the
   Earth, to see this rare spectacle.”

   Here's What's Actually Happening At Area 51 Right Now

   The Area 51 storm was always going to go one of two ways, according to
   the Internet memes.

   Option one:

   We were going to show up and a wave of Kyles, aided by furries and
   Karens, would distract the fire of the armed guards while the rest of
   us snuck around the back, at which point we would liberate the aliens
   from their captors and "clap alien cheeks". Nobody would get injured
   because we had Naruto run at the guards (thus dodging all their
   bullets).
   -
   -
   -


   Option two:

   We would actually show up and it would play out realistically. The wave
   of Kyles and Karens would be mown down by army fire as they attempted
   to Naruto run into an actual military air base.
   -

   So, in many ways, it's probably best that it played out as secret
   option number three: Everyone realized it was a joke and basically
   behaved themselves, bar one or two minor incidents.

   People arrived with the expressed intention to "clap them cheeks".
   -
   -

   And practiced their Naruto run. A lot.
   -
   -
   -

   But when it came down to actually raiding Area 51, that didn't actually
   materialize.
   -

   That isn't to say that the police didn't have to get involved.

   "On September 20 at approximately 3am, Nye County Sheriff's Office
   responded to the alien travel center on highway 373," the Sheriff's
   Office said in a video statement.

   "Crowds of approximately 40 people surrounded the parking lot of the
   travel center and made threats to storm the gates of Area 51. The crowd
   was compliant for commands from deputies and eventually dispersed. Some
   participants then assembled at the north and south gates, but heeded
   warnings upon confrontation with law enforcement and retreated. Several
   participants moved back and forth between the two gates and crowds
   continued to gather."

   If they were going to Naruto run at all, now was their chance.

   "At approximately 05:00, all participants had retreated and dispersed.
   Everyone was compliant and peaceful. All Nye County resources were
   returned to their assigned posts."

   The closest they came to any actual confrontation was one incident that
   resulted in a woman being detained for trying to trespass into Area 51,
   whilst a man was arrested for public urination just outside Area 51.
   -

   Part of the "raid" was captured on YouTube.

   This Guy Died One Of The Most Horrible Deaths In History

   History is filled with nauseatingly horrendous deaths that would bring
   tears to the eyes of most present-day revelers. But of all the cruel
   and unusual ways to reach the fateful end, few are more grueling than
   the one documented in a recently discovered skeleton.

   As reported in the Journal of Archaeological Science, archaeologists
   from the University of Milan have unearthed the Medieval skeleton of a
   man who appears to have died after a notoriously painful torture method
   and a botched beheading.

   The man died at a relatively young age, between 17 and 20 years of age,
   at some point during the 13th century and was buried near a cathedral
   in Milan, northern Italy.

   First impressions of his skeleton showed that he was suffering from
   wounds symmetrically positioned across his arms and legs, which hints
   at some kind of intentional injury. Based on historical records, the
   researchers hypothesized that the man had been tortured using “the
   wheel,” aka the "breaking wheel" or the "Catharine wheel".

   For those blissfully unaware of the wheel, it was a torture device used
   for public execution throughout much of European history until the
   start of the early modern era (c. 1500). Accounts of how this device
   was used differ depending on time and place, but it generally involved
   the methodical smashing and snapping of limbs, followed by afflicting
   further wheel-based trauma.

   In some accounts, torturers start by dropping the heavy wooden wheel
   onto people’s limbs, starting on the shin bones and working their way
   up. Once their body is sufficient battered, the broken limbs would be
   weaved in and out of the wheel spokes or tightly fastened to it using a
   rope. Injuries were then further afflicted – using either blades, blunt
   objects, fire, whips, or red-hot pincers – after which the wheel was
   mounted on a pole and proudly hung like a flag. The near-dead victim
   would hang here for some time, perhaps days or weeks, until they
   eventually perished or were put out of their misery with an execution.

   The grueling torture technique was most often used against those
   accused of heinous crimes, but in northern Italy, where this body was
   found, this kind of torture was usually reserved for persons suspected
   of being plague spreaders.

   “The victim of the wheel could have been considered as different by his
   contemporaries, and possibly this discrimination may have been the
   cause of his final conviction, as he could have been sacrificed, being
   a “freak”, by an angry crowd, as a plague spreader,” the researchers
   write.

   As if this wasn’t enough, forensic analysis of his skeleton discovered
   also revealed unusual linear fractures at the cranial base of his
   skull. This was most likely, the researchers say, the result of a sharp
   force trauma from a heavy weapon during a “clumsy decapitation."

   If this hypothesis of wheel torture is on the money, the researchers
   will have documented the first archaeological evidence a human being
   tortured by the wheel, certainly in medieval northern Italy, if not the
   world.

   One thing is more certain: this unfortunate soul did not have an
   enjoyable final few days on Earth.

   Lost Scrolls Charred By Mount Vesuvius Will Soon Be 'Virtually
   Unwrapped'

   In 79 CE, as Mount Vesuvius rained hell down on the towns of Pompeii
   and Herculaneum below, a fine set of scrolls laid in a private library
   near the coastline. Along with much of the towns and their people, the
   scrolls were carbonized through a blast of hot volcanic debris, searing
   them into lumps of brittle carbon that are too fragile to unravel.

   Now, almost 2,000 years on, a team of researchers say they finally have
   the technology to decipher the papyrus text.

   Scientists from the University of Kentucky have employed the help
   of Diamond Light Source, a synchrotron light source science facility in
   the UK, to blast the carbonized scrolls with high-energy X-rays to pick
   up on subtle hints of ink that are invisible to the naked eye. They
   will then use artificial intelligence to “fill in the gaps.”

   “We do not expect to immediately see the text from the upcoming scans,
   but they will provide the crucial building blocks for enabling that
   visualization," Professor Brent Seales, director of the Digital
   Restoration Initiative at the University of Kentucky, explained in
   a statement. "First, we will immediately see the internal structure of
   the scrolls in more definition than has ever been possible, and we need
   that level of detail to ferret out the highly compressed layers on
   which the text sits.

   “The machine-learning tool we are developing will amplify that ink
   signal by training a computer algorithm to recognize it – pixel by
   pixel – from photographs of opened fragments that show exactly where
   the ink is – voxel by voxel – in the corresponding tomographic data of
   the fragment,” he added.

   This particular set of scrolls, consisting of two complete scrolls and
   four fragments, were found alongside thousands of other papyri in 1752
   around the ruins of a Roman villa near the Bay of Naples. Collectively
   known as the Herculaneum papyri, the texts are thought to be the only
   surviving library from antiquity that exists in its entirety. The texts
   that have been successfully studied namely contain writings of a
   philosophical nature that provide a fascinating insight into the world
   of the Roman Empire.

   Many of these scrolls remain tightly closed and impossible to read in
   their current state. There have been attempts to physically unfurl a
   handful of the closed Herculaneum scrolls, however, the researchers say
   these have been “largely disastrous.” As such, many of the texts have
   remained untouched and their wisdom unknown.

   Judging by the team and technology being used this time around, the
   scrolls are in safe hands. Professor Seales, the computer scientist
   leading the work, has previously been involved in efforts to use
   imaging techniques on all kinds of ancient documents, including the
   En-Gedi scroll, the earliest copy ever found of an Old Testament Bible
   scripture.
