Cookie Policy

   Effective as of November 1, 2016, Zendesk, Inc., (“Zendesk”) and its
   subsidiaries, (collectively, the “Zendesk Group” or “we” or “us” or
   “our”) have updated our Cookie Policy (“Policy”). For a prior version
   of our Cookie Policy, click here.

   1. Intro

   This Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains that we believe in being open
   and clear about how we use your information. In the spirit of
   transparency, this Policy provides detailed information about how and
   when we use cookies on our Websites. For the purposes of this Policy,
   the term, “Websites”, shall refer collectively to www.zendesk.com as
   well as the other websites that the Zendesk Group operates and that
   link to this Policy.

   2. Does Zendesk use Cookies?

   Yes. The Zendesk Group and our marketing partners, affiliates, and
   analytics or service providers use cookies and other technologies to
   ensure everyone who uses the Websites has the best possible experience.

   3. What is a Cookie?

   A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a
   web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by
   a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the
   cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain
   preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out
   more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list here. We
   update this list quarterly, so there may be additional cookies that are
   not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the
   Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits,
   understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an
   email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on
   the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an
   individual and aggregated basis.

   4. Why does Zendesk use Cookies?

   When you visit the Websites, we may place a number of cookies in your
   browser. For example, we use cookies on the Websites to understand
   visitor and user preferences, improve their experience, and track and
   analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information. You can
   control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you
   disable cookies, you may still visit the Websites, but your ability to
   use some features or areas of the Websites may be limited.

   How to disable Cookies

   You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through a
   functionality built into your web browser. To learn more about how to
   control cookie settings through your browser:

   Click here to learn more about the “Private Browsing” setting and
   managing cookie settings in Firefox;

   guidance. In addition, certain third party advertising networks,
   including Google, permit users to opt out of or customize preferences

   feature from Google, click here.

   Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform
   users/visitors as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain
   circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of
   certain cookies.

   The Websites include third party social media features, such as the
   Facebook Like button, and third party widgets, such as the ‘Share This’
   button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Websites. These
   features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on
   the Websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to function
   properly. Your interaction with these features is governed by the
   privacy policy of the third party company providing it.

   We may use any of the following categories of cookies on the Websites
   as detailed below.

   Each cookie falls within one of the four following categories:
   Category Description

   1. Essential Cookies

   Essential cookies are sometimes called “strictly necessary” as without
   them we cannot provide many services that you need on the Websites. For
   example, essential cookies help remember your preferences as you move
   around the Websites.

   2. Analytics Cookies

   These cookies track information about visits to the Websites so that we
   can make improvements and report our performance. For example: analyze
   visitor and user behavior so as to provide more relevant content or
   suggest certain activities. They collect information about how visitors
   use the Websites, which site the user came from, the number of each
   user’s visits and how long a user stays on the Websites. We might also
   use analytics cookies to test new ads, pages, or features to see how
   users react to them.

   3. Functionality or Preference Cookies

   During your visit to the Websites, cookies are used to remember
   information you have entered or choices you make (such as your
   username, language or your region) on the Websites. They also store
   your preferences when personalizing the Websites to optimize your use
   of Zendesk, for example, your preferred language. These preferences are
   remembered, through the use of the persistent cookies, and the next
   time you visit the Websites you will not have to set them again.

   4. Targeting or Advertising Cookies

   These cookies are placed by third party advertising platforms or
   networks in order to, deliver ads and track ad performance, enable
   advertising networks to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based
   upon your activities (this is sometimes called “behavioral” or
   “targeted” advertising) on the Websites. They may subsequently use
   information about your visit to target you with advertising that you
   may be interested in, on the Websites and other websites. For example,
   these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Websites.

This is a Zen Desk

   It’s true that Zendesk was created to bring a sense of calm to the
   often chaotic world of customer service.

   It’s also true that Zendesk was born on a literal desk. Well, actually
   it was a door. And really,  it was more of a kitchen table. A lot of
   beer was spilled on it. Innocence was lost here, direction and purpose
   found.
   The original Zen Desk

Zendesk isn’t...

   Your mum’s
   favourite spa.

   A breeding farm
   for succulents.

   A very chill desk company.

   An alternative band.

Diversity and Inclusion

People first

Astha

Astha

   Astha appreciates Zendesk for building a workplace that’s inclusive to
   everyone. As the Vice President of Product and Platform Marketing, she
   treats diversity and inclusion as a cultural priority, and makes an
   effort to build and foster a diverse team. As a leader, she mentors
   employees looking to develop leadership skills and grow their career.

Craig

Craig

   Craig is a San Francisco native whose first-hand experience of the tech
   industry motivated him to claim his spot in the industry. As a co-chair
   of Mosaic, the Zendesk employee resource group for people of color,
   Craig constantly works to make sure where he works is an inclusive
   space for all.

Allison

Allison

   To Allison, the most misunderstood part about diversity and inclusion
   is that it’s difficult. As a product designer, inclusivity means making
   software the most usable for the widest range of people, including—but
   not limited to—people with disabilities. Her spirit of inclusion and
   accessibility makes our product more relevant, intuitive, and easier to
   use for everyone.

Anthony

Anthony

   All things tech always piqued Anthony’s attention, but the reality of
   earning a coveted spot in the industry seemed nearly impossible. That
   all changed when he was accepted into YearUp, an intensive technical
   training and career development program that partners with Zendesk. Now
   Anthony makes sure that underrepresented people know that their voices
   and perspectives are valued in the industry.

Solu

Solu

   Solu, originally from Nigeria, started her career in the United States
   as a software engineer. As a Director of Business Operations, she
   empowers her colleagues professionally. She serves as the professional
   development lead for Mosaic, the Zendesk employee resource group for
   people of color, where she strives to build confidence in every member.

Where we stand

   Let’s clear the air. When a business talks about diversity, it can feel
   forced. At Zendesk, we try to keep it simple. Diversity and inclusion
   are more than buzzwords, and bigger than the bottom line.

   It’s about our people knowing that they’re valued where they work.

Open to all

   Employees at Zendesk work hard to build a culture where everyone
   belongs. Employee Resource Groups play a vital role in creating
   communities that bring us together and ensure we feel supported at
   work. We’ll let them speak for themselves—here are their mission
   statements.

Global Veterans Network

   The Global Veterans Network celebrates services veterans in and out of
   Zendesk. Collectively, they guide veterans transitioning into the
   workforce with professional training and coaching opportunities.

Mosaic

   Mosaic is a collective that encourages people of color at Zendesk to
   embrace and celebrate their differences. Mosaic works together to
   create a safe space to openly discuss personal experiences, build
   stronger networks, and provide professional growth opportunities for
   members and allies through mentorship and peer connections.

Pride

   Pride ensures that all LGBTQ+ employees are valued, seen, and
   supported. Their mission is to invite awareness and inspire their
   coworkers to create space for the Zendesk LGBTQ+ community. Pride
   actively promotes diversity in events, and creates partner events,
   company policy initiatives, and educational opportunities.

The Village

   The Village connects parents and caregivers at Zendesk. Their mission
   is to provide a support system to employees who juggle balancing work
   and parenting or caring. Whether an employee is transitioning back from
   parental leave, raising little people, or caring for a loved one—this
   community is here to lend a hand.

Women at Zendesk

   Women at Zendesk celebrates women at every level of their careers. WAZ
   builds a foundation to support women to achieve their personal and
   professional goals. Efforts include collaborating with recruitment to
   extend the pipeline to seek qualified women for roles across the
   company, and working with organizations that uplift women in each
   office.

Women in Engineering

   Women in Engineering champion and create a space where women engineers
   can meet and build supportive relationships with each other across each
   office. Their mission is to develop a community where employees can
   collectively use their talents to improve, innovate, and contribute to
   their success as engineers.

   Zendesk by the numbers

Our representation today

   The reality is our whole industry struggles with representation,
   including us. This is our starting point to see where there’s room for
   improvement. We’re strengthening the talent pipeline and beginning to
   incorporate diversity and inclusion efforts with our Recruiting, Total
   Rewards, and People Development teams.

Unconcious bias

   We all have unconscious biases—and people we work with have them, too.
   At Zendesk, we’re taking steps to navigate and acknowledge them.

   To make this happen, we launched learning labs in every office to offer
   in-person working sessions available to all employees. The sessions
   provide employees with the education and resources to be more aware of
   unconscious bias, and learn strategies to mitigate them in the
   workplace.

Mentorship

   Getting a foot through the door is just the first step. To further
   advance the skills of our employees, several mentoring programs have
   launched to provide professional development and support career growth.

Everwise

   provides career mentorship to protégés working to achieve their
   professional goals. The programme connects employees with external
   mentors, resources, and peer networks to help them be more productive
   in every stage of their career.

Illuminate

   is a two-day leadership development programme for early-career leaders.
   People Managers get together across our global offices to learn
   additional leadership skills and ways to put their new skills into
   practice at work in this collaborative community.

Women at Zendesk

   launched an internal three-month mentorship programme connecting women
   at Zendesk. The Women’s Mentorship Programmes pair mentors and mentees
   together to share their experiences, learn from each other, ask for
   advice, and inspire development in their career path.

Mosaic

   hosts a speed mentoring event every quarter to provide employees with
   the opportunity to expand their professional networks, ask career
   development questions, and receive advice from people in leadership
   roles.

Our global impact

   Where we work is a big part of how we work — we want to see positive
   change in our neighborhoods, too. To lend an extra set of hands, we
   partner up with organizations to help shape, educate, and drive
   progress beyond Zendesk. Here’s just a few.
