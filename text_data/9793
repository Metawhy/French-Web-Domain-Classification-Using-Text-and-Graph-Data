TYPES OF CURL

   PHOTOS/POST/GRAPHIC DESIGN: KRISTIN ESS

   Yesterday I was thinking, we really need a way to show each kind of
   curl. Not the natural curls  that you get from good genes, but the kind
   you strive for when using your curling iron, wand or even a flat iron.
   I think this will be helpful moving forward so that when I post hair
   new tutorials I have a specific post to point to and reference the type
   curl I’m using to get that hairstyle. In this post, we’re only using a
   1″ barrel curling iron because this isn’t about iron size, it’s about
   curl method and what type of curl each technique produces. Okay, let’s
   make a “Curl Catalogue”, shall we?

   This is the kind of wave you find in our EVERYDAY WAVES video. You
   start at the top or middle and inch your way down. This is my go-to all
   time favorite way to curl because it’s so easy and quick. You also get
   a little extra hold when you start from the middle or top because
   you’re applying iron heat directly to that portion of the hair, which
   will help so much with hold. I specifically love this because if you
   have any frizz, the clamp, which is also hot, presses the hair to seal
   both sides, unlike a wand where you would have one side open (but we’ll
   get to that below).

   This is one of my least favorite curling methods for anyone with bob
   length or longer, and it’s usually the one we’re taught first by our
   sisters, aunts, grandmas, moms, best friends, etc… when we’re young.
   You’d think it would make sense to start at the bottom and curl upward,
   but curling from the ends up puts most of the heat on the ends and very
   little on the middle which is where we need it most. Long run, this
   just dries out your ends and curl will fall out much quicker than it
   will if you use the “middle to ends” method up top. This curl is bottom
   heavy and will tend to make anything longer than bob length hair look
   super “triangular”. Know who this IS great for though– women with short
   hair who want a fuller “roller set” look.

   If you like the look of the “Ends to Middle” method above but find that
   it doesn’t hold, or if you want that Old Hollywood glam vibe, try this
   one! Curl your hair, then set it with a setting clip and let it cool
   until all of the heat is gone and the hair is cold to the touch. I
   still like to start in the middle and inch my way down to the ends so
   that I can apply direct iron heat to the middle of the hair instead of
   just frying the ends until the middle gets hot enough. But when you set
   it and let it cool, you have a much higher chance of it holding the way
   you want it to.

   Hello, heaven. These are the best for shorter hair because you can
   control where you put the dips + bumps much more than you can with a
   curling iron. Flat iron waves can be done on any length of hair, as you
   can see we did it on long hair in this tutorial. It takes a while to
   learn, but once you get the hang of it, it’s so easy and fast.

   This is an amazing technique for all our natural texture girls or
   anyone who wants to spend a day away from their naturally curly hair. I
   have some clients who have beautiful natural curl, but every once in a
   great while they want to have curling iron waves, too! Using a flat
   iron to curl means you’re pressing the hair from both sides,
   eliminating puffiness or chance of frizz while you curl. It’s not
   something I recommend doing every day, but more on occasion. Pressing
   heat into your hair from both sides with a powerful flat iron every day
   could cause dryness, in my opinion. But then again so can any hot tool
   so just be mindful! If you don’t need the additional heat, then try the
   curling iron method at the top “Curling Middle to Ends”.

   Okay, the WAND! People love a wand. The best thing about a wand is that
   you’re going to get lots of volume. There’s nothing pressing on the
   other side (like a clamp) so the hair can stay full even while being
   curled. In other words, it’s not being “smashed” against the hot
   barrel. With this method, you can see that the hair is being wrapped
   flat against the barrel with no twisting. The effect is a very
   pattern-y curl once it’s brushed out. This is my favorite for fine hair
   who wants voluminous waves! To keep the hair flat against the iron,
   you’ll have to adjust your hands each time you go around the iron,
   otherwise the hair will naturally want to twist around the barrel.
   Practice with the wand off first!

   Wand way number 2! Love this for anyone trying to refine a natural
   curl. Twist the hair before you wrap it. Not super tight, and make sure
   you twist the direction of the natural curl pattern. Wrap it around the
   wand, release, and then gently pull and fatten it up with your fingers.
   I love this because the pattern, much like natural curl, isn’t exact.
   It’s a little tighter in one spot and a little looser in another. This
   is great for wavy girls who have an unruly patch of frizz.

   This method is going to give you a more “boho-y” look all over. You’ll
   get a curling iron-like pattern up top and loose, tousled waves at the
   bottom. I love this for super long hair or anyone with really thick
   hair. Start by flat-wrapping at the top, then when you get to the
   middle, don’t let go of the hair, just keep wrapping and it will
   naturally coil.

   Last but not least, the mermaid-making 3-prong iron. This is also
   called a waving iron. You can definitely see the pattern it makes. It’s
   almost like a larger, rounder crimper. Whenever I used this, I like to
   switch up my angles. So for example– I will press it perfectly
   horizontal and then move down a section and do it slightly diagonal.
   This makes the pattern look a little more natural and breaks up the
   crimped look. I would use this if I was attending a beach wedding and
   wanted to channel Daryl Hannah from Splash.


   Okay, now spill it! Which one is your favorite method and what type of
   hair do you have? Would love to hear about it in the comments below
   because your feedback could greatly help another reader who is trying
   to find their new favorite…

MESSY KNOTTED PONYTAIL

   PHOTOS/POST/GRAPHIC DESIGN: KRISTIN ESS

   PHOTOS/POST/GRAPHIC DESIGN: KRISTIN ESS

   Summer’s creepin’ hard and if you’re in Southern California like us, it
   has arrived early. Wherever you live, warm weather means messy waves,
   braids and ponytails so let’s start with this gem, shall we? This look
   was created on the fly with no plan so excuse the unconventional-ness
   of it, but sometimes those make the best looks. Alright, here we go…

   You’ll need (click for product details)
     * A WAND
     * TEXTURE POWDER
     * SMALL BOBBY PINS
     * MINI (MICRO) CLAW CLIPS
     * HAIRSPRAY (optional)

   Air dry your hair for this tutorial for better waves and more support
   —>> Remember the airdrying/waves tutorial?

   messy knotted ponytail tutorial


    1. Add some quick wand waves all around the head.
    2. Go in different directions for a messier result. Don’t brush out
       your waves when you finish, just finger comb at the most.
    3. Next, add a little texture powder into the hair. I like to do a
       LITTLE bit all over because too much will make the hair feel sticky
       and gross. Just a little sprinkle all over will make it feel
       beach-y and look fuller. The main reason we use texture powder for
       this is so the little strands don’t slip. Texture powder creates an
       amazing grip, making it much less likely for the bobby pins to
       slide out.
    4. Once your texture powder is applied, take two small strands from
       the front (right around the temple area) and pull them back.
    5. Tie those in a half knot.
    6. Take two of your mini bobby pins and criss cross them through the
       half knot to secure.
    7. Now the tricky part! Take those two strands from the tail of your
       knot and criss cross them underneath the ponytail near the nape of
       your neck. Grab one of your MICRO CLIPS and secure the criss
       crossed pieces behind the ponytail. Wiggle the tiny clip into the
       ponytail to conceal it. Seems like you’d see them, but trust me,
       these are so small, they disappear into the ponytail (which looks
       and feels extra thick because of the texture powder).
    8. Gather a little more hair from the back to thicken up each strand
       before pulling it around and tying it again.
    9. Repeat as many times as desired.  You can do it once, twice or 5
       times if it will work with your length!
   10. Last you’ll want to pull the hair gently to create a little more
       texture. Add another sprinkling of texture powder if desired.

   Love this pony for a party, a long weekend (might look even cooler
   second day) and it could also be a good music festival hair idea! If
   you try the messy knotted ponytail, be sure to tag us so we can see
   your handiwork! @THEBEAUTYDEPT

A BLANK CANVAS

   Post & Photography by Amy Nadine, Graphic Design by Eunice Chun

   For some of us, melasma and hyperpigmentation are a part of life and
   every now and then we have an important occasion that calls for full
   coverage. But that doesn’t mean we have to go out and buy a full
   coverage foundation (it’s not good to wear that much coverage on a
   daily basis anyway). Just make your own with concealer and face lotion!
   I personally think it gives better coverage than the “full coverage”
   foundations that are out there. Again, please don’t do this every day,
   as I don’t know how sensitive your skin is to breakouts, even though
   this shouldn’t cause a breakout as concealers are formulated to also
   cover blemishes. So just save it for an emergency situation where you
   find out you’re going to be on television or have your picture taken
   for something important! Here’s how:

   TOOLS:
     * Your Favorite Liquid Concealer — the best coverage that I’ve ever
       found are Amazing Cosmetics Concealer, Estee Lauder Maximum Cover
       and Tarte Maracuja Creaseless Concealer. Just make sure it is your
       true shade match and not lighter than your skin tone!
     * Your Favorite Face Lotion — I’m obsessed with Melvita BioExcellence
       Face Lotion because it’s a Certified Organic line from France that
       is made from flowers and only the finest natural ingredients
       (99.47% natural to be exact!).
     * A Foundation Brush, Sponge or Fingers to apply it with.
     * Contouring Cream — I used Chanel Soleil Tan de Chanel and if you
       need a contouring refresher, visit my Contouring Tutorial again!

   STEPS:
    1. For every two pumps of face lotion, pump once with concealer (a 2:1
       ratio has always worked for me as 1:1 is a little too “newscaster
       mask”).
    2. With your finger or a spatula, mix the two together by swirling it
       around until it’s one consistent shade.
    3. Dip a foundation brush into the mixture.
    4. Sweep the foundation brush all over your face and neck, reloading
       whenever necessary.
    5. Now that you have a blank canvas, promise me you’ll go back and add
       the dimension back in!! I used a cream bronzer but you can
       certainly use a powder bronzer if that’s your preference.

   1″ barrel curling iron because this isn’t about iron size, it’s about
   curl method and what type of curl each technique produces. Okay, let’s
   make a “Curl Catalogue”, shall we?

   This is the kind of wave you find in our EVERYDAY WAVES video. You
   start at the top or middle and inch your way down. This is my go-to all
   time favorite way to curl because it’s so easy and quick. You also get
   a little extra hold when you start from the middle or top because
   you’re applying iron heat directly to that portion of the hair, which
   will help so much with hold. I specifically love this because if you
   have any frizz, the clamp, which is also hot, presses the hair to seal
   both sides, unlike a wand where you would have one side open (but we’ll
   get to that below).

   This is one of my least favorite curling methods for anyone with bob
   length or longer, and it’s usually the one we’re taught first by our
   sisters, aunts, grandmas, moms, best friends, etc… when we’re young.
   You’d think it would make sense to start at the bottom and curl upward,
   but curling from the ends up puts most of the heat on the ends and very
   little on the middle which is where we need it most. Long run, this
   just dries out your ends and curl will fall out much quicker than it
   will if you use the “middle to ends” method up top. This curl is bottom
   heavy and will tend to make anything longer than bob length hair look
   super “triangular”. Know who this IS great for though– women with short
   hair who want a fuller “roller set” look.

   If you like the look of the “Ends to Middle” method above but find that
   it doesn’t hold, or if you want that Old Hollywood glam vibe, try this
   one! Curl your hair, then set it with a setting clip and let it cool
   until all of the heat is gone and the hair is cold to the touch. I
   still like to start in the middle and inch my way down to the ends so
   that I can apply direct iron heat to the middle of the hair instead of
   just frying the ends until the middle gets hot enough. But when you set
   it and let it cool, you have a much higher chance of it holding the way
   you want it to.

   Hello, heaven. These are the best for shorter hair because you can
   control where you put the dips + bumps much more than you can with a
   curling iron. Flat iron waves can be done on any length of hair, as you
   can see we did it on long hair in this tutorial. It takes a while to
   learn, but once you get the hang of it, it’s so easy and fast.

   This is an amazing technique for all our natural texture girls or
   anyone who wants to spend a day away from their naturally curly hair. I
   have some clients who have beautiful natural curl, but every once in a
   great while they want to have curling iron waves, too! Using a flat
   iron to curl means you’re pressing the hair from both sides,
   eliminating puffiness or chance of frizz while you curl. It’s not
   something I recommend doing every day, but more on occasion. Pressing
   heat into your hair from both sides with a powerful flat iron every day
   could cause dryness, in my opinion. But then again so can any hot tool
   so just be mindful! If you don’t need the additional heat, then try the
   curling iron method at the top “Curling Middle to Ends”.

   Okay, the WAND! People love a wand. The best thing about a wand is that
   you’re going to get lots of volume. There’s nothing pressing on the
   other side (like a clamp) so the hair can stay full even while being
   curled. In other words, it’s not being “smashed” against the hot
   barrel. With this method, you can see that the hair is being wrapped
   flat against the barrel with no twisting. The effect is a very
   pattern-y curl once it’s brushed out. This is my favorite for fine hair
   who wants voluminous waves! To keep the hair flat against the iron,
   you’ll have to adjust your hands each time you go around the iron,
   otherwise the hair will naturally want to twist around the barrel.
   Practice with the wand off first!

   Wand way number 2! Love this for anyone trying to refine a natural
   curl. Twist the hair before you wrap it. Not super tight, and make sure
   you twist the direction of the natural curl pattern. Wrap it around the
   wand, release, and then gently pull and fatten it up with your fingers.
   I love this because the pattern, much like natural curl, isn’t exact.
   It’s a little tighter in one spot and a little looser in another. This
   is great for wavy girls who have an unruly patch of frizz.

   This method is going to give you a more “boho-y” look all over. You’ll
   get a curling iron-like pattern up top and loose, tousled waves at the
   bottom. I love this for super long hair or anyone with really thick
   hair. Start by flat-wrapping at the top, then when you get to the
   middle, don’t let go of the hair, just keep wrapping and it will
   naturally coil.

   Last but not least, the mermaid-making 3-prong iron. This is also
   called a waving iron. You can definitely see the pattern it makes. It’s
   almost like a larger, rounder crimper. Whenever I used this, I like to
   switch up my angles. So for example– I will press it perfectly
   horizontal and then move down a section and do it slightly diagonal.
   This makes the pattern look a little more natural and breaks up the
   crimped look. I would use this if I was attending a beach wedding and
   wanted to channel Daryl Hannah from Splash.


   Okay, now spill it! Which one is your favorite method and what type of
   hair do you have? Would love to hear about it in the comments below
   because your feedback could greatly help another reader who is trying
   to find their new favorite…

MESSY KNOTTED PONYTAIL

   PHOTOS/POST/GRAPHIC DESIGN: KRISTIN ESS

   PHOTOS/POST/GRAPHIC DESIGN: KRISTIN ESS

   Summer’s creepin’ hard and if you’re in Southern California like us, it
   has arrived early. Wherever you live, warm weather means messy waves,
   braids and ponytails so let’s start with this gem, shall we? This look
   was created on the fly with no plan so excuse the unconventional-ness
   of it, but sometimes those make the best looks. Alright, here we go…

   You’ll need (click for product details)
     * A WAND
     * TEXTURE POWDER
     * SMALL BOBBY PINS
     * MINI (MICRO) CLAW CLIPS
     * HAIRSPRAY (optional)

   Air dry your hair for this tutorial for better waves and more support
   —>> Remember the airdrying/waves tutorial?

   messy knotted ponytail tutorial


    1. Add some quick wand waves all around the head.
    2. Go in different directions for a messier result. Don’t brush out
       your waves when you finish, just finger comb at the most.
    3. Next, add a little texture powder into the hair. I like to do a
       LITTLE bit all over because too much will make the hair feel sticky
       and gross. Just a little sprinkle all over will make it feel
       beach-y and look fuller. The main reason we use texture powder for
       this is so the little strands don’t slip. Texture powder creates an
       amazing grip, making it much less likely for the bobby pins to
       slide out.
    4. Once your texture powder is applied, take two small strands from
       the front (right around the temple area) and pull them back.
    5. Tie those in a half knot.
    6. Take two of your mini bobby pins and criss cross them through the
       half knot to secure.
    7. Now the tricky part! Take those two strands from the tail of your
       knot and criss cross them underneath the ponytail near the nape of
       your neck. Grab one of your MICRO CLIPS and secure the criss
       crossed pieces behind the ponytail. Wiggle the tiny clip into the
       ponytail to conceal it. Seems like you’d see them, but trust me,
       these are so small, they disappear into the ponytail (which looks
       and feels extra thick because of the texture powder).
    8. Gather a little more hair from the back to thicken up each strand
       before pulling it around and tying it again.
    9. Repeat as many times as desired.  You can do it once, twice or 5
       times if it will work with your length!
   10. Last you’ll want to pull the hair gently to create a little more
       texture. Add another sprinkling of texture powder if desired.

   Love this pony for a party, a long weekend (might look even cooler
   second day) and it could also be a good music festival hair idea! If
   you try the messy knotted ponytail, be sure to tag us so we can see
   your handiwork! @THEBEAUTYDEPT

A BLANK CANVAS

   Post & Photography by Amy Nadine, Graphic Design by Eunice Chun

   For some of us, melasma and hyperpigmentation are a part of life and
   every now and then we have an important occasion that calls for full
   coverage. But that doesn’t mean we have to go out and buy a full
   coverage foundation (it’s not good to wear that much coverage on a
   daily basis anyway). Just make your own with concealer and face lotion!
   I personally think it gives better coverage than the “full coverage”
   foundations that are out there. Again, please don’t do this every day,
   as I don’t know how sensitive your skin is to breakouts, even though
   this shouldn’t cause a breakout as concealers are formulated to also
   cover blemishes. So just save it for an emergency situation where you
   find out you’re going to be on television or have your picture taken
   for something important! Here’s how:

   TOOLS:
     * Your Favorite Liquid Concealer — the best coverage that I’ve ever
       found are Amazing Cosmetics Concealer, Estee Lauder Maximum Cover
       and Tarte Maracuja Creaseless Concealer. Just make sure it is your
       true shade match and not lighter than your skin tone!
     * Your Favorite Face Lotion — I’m obsessed with Melvita BioExcellence
       Face Lotion because it’s a Certified Organic line from France that
       is made from flowers and only the finest natural ingredients
       (99.47% natural to be exact!).
     * A Foundation Brush, Sponge or Fingers to apply it with.
     * Contouring Cream — I used Chanel Soleil Tan de Chanel and if you
       need a contouring refresher, visit my Contouring Tutorial again!

   STEPS:
    1. For every two pumps of face lotion, pump once with concealer (a 2:1
       ratio has always worked for me as 1:1 is a little too “newscaster
       mask”).
    2. With your finger or a spatula, mix the two together by swirling it
       around until it’s one consistent shade.
    3. Dip a foundation brush into the mixture.
    4. Sweep the foundation brush all over your face and neck, reloading
       whenever necessary.
    5. Now that you have a blank canvas, promise me you’ll go back and add
       the dimension back in!! I used a cream bronzer but you can
       certainly use a powder bronzer if that’s your preference.
