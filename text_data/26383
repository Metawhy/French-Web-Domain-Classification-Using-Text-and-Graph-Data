Streaming, reinvented for classical music

   Audio streaming is becoming the predominant way of listening to music.
   But the well-known all-genre services are pop-driven, and their
   structure only allows for three search categories: song, artist, and
   album. Classical music is available on these major streaming services,
   but the criteria that make classical music so special – composer, work,
   conductor, orchestra, soloist, and more – are missing from the
   structure. For this reason, classical music lovers who use these
   services struggle with a lack of user-friendliness and search options
   as well as confusing and sometimes incorrect search results. Musicians
   and their recordings can thus only be found with difficulty or not at
   all, drastically reducing visibility for classical musicians on these
   platforms.

   At IDAGIO, we have developed a proprietary data model and our own
   unique technological solution to structure and display classical music
   in a clear, clean way. That is why users, musicians, and labels alike
   affirm that IDAGIO has developed the very best interface for classical
   music.

     This is the must have app for classical lovers
