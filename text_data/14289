Broad visibility of your profile

   By creating your profile on Match, it will be visible on the local
   variants of our service which use the same platform operated under
   different brand names. For more information about the terms of your
   profile’s extended visibility, click here.

Trust and safety

   Ensuring the safety of our clients is our top priority. Profiles are
   moderated and your personal data is protected.

   Want to be more in control?

   Choose “Incognito Mode”

   View dating profiles discreetly and only appear to members you are
   interested in.

   Opt for “Zen Mode”

   You’ll only be contacted by profiles that match your criteria.

How does it work?

You are three steps away from meeting your special someone

1 Tell us who you are!

   Talk about yourself. The secret? Be natural, honest and spontaneous. A
   few lines are enough to make an impression.

   Why not add a bit of humour, too?
   Be precise: the more search criteria you complete, the greater your
   chances are of being contacted by singles who share the same interests
   as you.

   Share your photos. Create an album that reflects your personality.
