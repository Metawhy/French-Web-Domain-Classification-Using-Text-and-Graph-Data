Welcome That New Baby With Angel Wings

    Hello everyone!
   I'm so excited to back and sharing with you what I've been up to.
   I've been making the cutest door hangers to welcome that new baby.

   I start out by making my wire form in the shape of angel wings. Then I
   stretch bridal lace across them and hand sew to the wire.

   Next, I add my trim which could be a boa or various ribbons like the
   camouflage ribbon on this boy's hanger.

   I then add cute little bears that hold a pacifier and ribbon with
   miniature baby items like pacifiers and rattles.

   Last I take chipboard letters for the new baby's name, paint them to
   match, and attach them to the ribbon.

   shop. I ship and take credit cards.
