     ”I was going to discontinue Balance of Nature products because I
     didn’t see results right away. Then my health coach talked to me and
     I decided to continue with it a little longer. I am ready to tell
     you that I see results. I really see it.”

   Derrick, NJ

Meet Dr. Howard

The Formulator

   Our story begins in the early 90’s with a young physician named Dr.
   Douglas Howard who was concerned about the increasing epidemic of
   lifestyle diseases. He was concerned about his family and patients
   staying active, happy, and healthy.

   Dr. Howard traveled the world studying medicine, nutrition, and
   chiropractic to find answers. All his research and experience pointed
   to a basic solution: personal accountability. As he helped his patients
   take responsibility for their choices in nutrition, physical activity,
   and mental health, their quality of life improved. Dr. Howard began
   researching and developing reasonable ways for people to incorporate
   healthy habits into their lifestyle and make permanent changes.

   Today, Dr. Howard is one of the leading researchers in phytonutrition.
   He continues to research and lecture around the world. Balance of
   Nature products are the culmination of his passion for people, health,
   and science.

Our Philosophy

The Triad of Health

   Complete health can only be achieved through personal accountability.
   During 20 years of practice, Dr. Howard developed a simple philosophy
   to clarify your personal health responsibilities: The Triad of Health.

   Physical Health: This is what you do and how your body functions, all
   the way down to the cellular level. This side of the triad includes
   consistent physical activity and proper function of your physical body.

   Spiritual Health: This encompasses spiritual, mental, and emotional
   health. This side of the triad includes what you think, how you think,
   your relationships, and your attitude. We believe complete health
   cannot dismiss your relationship with God and daily personal
   meditation.

   Chemical Health: This involves every function of your body. This side
   of the triad includes what you eat, drink, breathe, absorb, or consume
   in any way. Your body is a fantastic chemical laboratory—the substances
   you choose to expose it to affect its intricate functions & processes.
