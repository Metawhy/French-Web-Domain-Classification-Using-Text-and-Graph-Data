BCI-LIFT: an Inria Project-Lab

Objective

   BCI-LIFT is a large-scale 4-year research initiative whose aim is to
   reach a next generation of non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces
   (BCI), more specifically BCI that are easier to appropriate, more
   efficient, and suit a larger number of people.
   With this concern of usability as our driving objective, we will build
   non-invasive systems that benefit from advanced signal processing and
   machine learning methods, from smart interface design, and where the
   user immediately receives supportive feedback. What drives this project
   is the concern that a substantial proportion of human participants is
   currently categorized “BCI-illiterate” because of their apparent
   inability to communicate through BCI. Through this project we aim at
   making it easier for people to learn to use the BCI, by implementing
   appropriate machine learning methods and developping user training
   scenarios.
