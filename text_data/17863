   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   We've all had to deal with the same thing. Your phone is ringing and
   the display shows an unknown number you haven't seen before. So you're
   asking yourself whether to answer it or not!? Who is calling? You are
   certainly not the first one to ask these questions. For this reason,
   tellows developed a database which will help you with your decision
   about answering or ignoring the phone call. This will definitely save
   you time and energy. Yet, there is more to it. In addition to a risk
   rating, tellows provides an approximate location of the number calling.
   This helps you to find out the origin of the phone call. For additional
   information visit our Tellows Blog.

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   The tellows community allows you to comment any telephone number. We
   analyze and classify the calls according to the type of call. The core
   of tellows is the so-called tellows score. A thought-out algorithm that
   classifies any number in relation to its risk level. This in turn makes
   it easier for you to decide whether it is safe to answer the call or
   not. In order to gather as much information as possible about all the
   numbers in question, we need your help! With the help of your comments
   about the numbers and your risk rating you certainly help us to enrich
   our phone number database.
