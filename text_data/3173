   TILDE TRANSLATOR

Our translator supports a wide range of languages, both large and small

   Not all languages are alike. Though larger languages enjoy widespread
   support from language technology, smaller languages are overlooked. To
   ensure that Europe’s languages are given equal treatment, we focus on
   complex and highly inflected languages.
