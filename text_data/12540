   Engineers from Caltech have generated a computer simulation of
   underwater bubble rings that is so realistic it is virtually
   indistinguishable from a video of the real thing. Its developers hope
   that the simulation can shed light on the mathematics and forces that
   govern such phenomena. • See the full video and learn more about the
   research - just search “bubble rings” on Caltech.edu.

   Coming to a Head: Insights from a Vampire of the Deep
   Vertebrates, from fish to humans, have a backbone and a large head that
   includes jaws for efficient eating. By studying primitive jawless
   vertebrates, Caltech scientists show that gradual, progressive
   alterations to a cell type called the neural crest added new features,
   producing an ever-improving head.

   Robert Grubbs
     * Victor and Elizabeth Atkins Professor of Chemistry

Robert Grubbs

   Exposing undergraduate students to different kinds of research is a
   cause Nobel laureate Robert Grubbs cares about deeply. He intentionally
   welcomes undergraduates into his laboratory during the pivotal years
   when they begin to imagine their futures in science.

   Nayla Abney
     * Undergraduate Student

Nayla Abney

   Nayla Abney took a chance leaving New Jersey and the East Coast to come
   to Caltech. She helped launch the inaugural season for women's soccer
   at Caltech in 2017 and says the sport and the team teach lessons that
   help her in the classroom and on the field. The chemical engineering
   major is inspired by the researchers and professors on campus, and she
   is committed to building a legacy for other young women at Caltech.

   Sean Carroll
     * Research Professor of Physics

Sean Carroll

   While science is a powerful tool for understanding our universe, it is
   not the only one, insists Caltech theoretical physicist Sean Carroll.
   On Mindscape, his podcast, Carroll hosts conversations with interesting
   thinkers on topics across the academic spectrum: from superstring
   theory to the fall of Rome and everything in between.
