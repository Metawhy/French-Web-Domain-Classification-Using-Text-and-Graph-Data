   event-based triggers, scripts, actions, notifications and voice
   control.

   Synology... Access it with apps for the web, iOS, Android and others.

Set up your own openHAB system in just a few steps

   Try the provided hassle-free openHABian image for the Raspberry Pi, a
   widely used and recommended hardware choice. Flash an SD card, boot,
   and enjoy your up-to-date openHAB setup with conveniently

   Eclipse Mosquitto.
   Learn How ➜

No Cloud Required...

   openHAB runs on your hardware, doesn't require any cloud service to
   work, keeps your data privately at home and talks directly to your
   local devices whenever possible. At the core of our philosophy is that
   you always remain in control.

...but Cloud-Friendly

   Integrations are available for the most popular cloud-based smart home
   platforms, including Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and
   IFTTT. Use the openHAB Cloud connector with the free myopenhab.org
   service or host your own.
