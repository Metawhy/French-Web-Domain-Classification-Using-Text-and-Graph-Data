Ashleigh's Birthday Card

   Hi Everybody,
   We had a lovely day yesterday celebrating two birthdays within my
   family.  We went out to a restaurant for a Sunday lunch and I am always
   happy with a roast beef dinner Mmmmm !!
   I made a really special card for Ashleigh and if you wanted to make the
   same kind of card you can and although it looks intricate it is really
   quite easy to put together.
   [SAM_8469.JPG]
   [SAM_8474.JPG] I bought the template for the design from
    Sandra Strijland and you need to email her  and ask to buy the
   template to the
     BOW CARD
   It is not expensive and I don't think you will be disappointed with
   your make either.
   Once you have the template you can use it over and over again but
   please don't share it with any one else.  Point them in the direction
   to buy their own.
   [SAM_8471.JPG]
   Wouldn't it make a beautiful Wedding card ??
   It would certainly be one to treasure for a long time.
   I have asked Sandra's permission to video the making of this card so it
   will be coming to the blog pages in the not too distant future
   More tomorrow ...
   Hugs xx

Die Cutting Essentials 57- Memory Box Die Set

   [SAM_8440.JPG] Hi Everybody,
   I am adding a video today to tell you about this months edition of Die
   Cutting Essentials 57
   The exclusive gift with the magazine is this lovely five piece die set
   from Memory Box
   In the video I have shown you what all the individual dies will cut and
   there are lots of ways that they can be used.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/znxyPpJY2YY

   The best thing to do is cut all the pieces out, from any new die that
   you get, and then play to see what looks good with what. Which die cut
   can be cut to give you another look ... what happens if you turn one
   round or even upside down.
   There are many many ideas waiting for you to find them in all die cuts
   and at the end of the day it is only card and paper you are playing
   with. So enjoy the process and see what you can come up with.
   Just to let you know that I will be on Craft Stash Facebook Live page
   this coming Friday at 1 pm so I hope you will pop along to visit and
   maybe leave a comment for me there too.
   I have some exciting new dies to share with you
   More tomorrow ...
   Hugs xx

Ruby - how she has grown ...

   [IMG_1137.jpg] Hi Everyone,
   It's me Ruby and I haven't been to talk to you all for a little while
   but a lot has happened in my life in the past year.
   I was born on the 17th August 2016 and this is me at nine weeks old ...
   now you must admit that I am rather cute and my dad decided to call me
   Ruby.
   I have been so happy here and grown up into a really rather special
   dog. Well my mum tells me that I am.
   I have a very special friend too called Dougal and he is only two weeks
   older than me and he is a Cockapoo.
   We love playing together and we spend al lot of time with each other.
   He is bigger than me BUT I am the boss and he always lets me win
   whatever we do.
   Well nearly always !!
   [IMG_1293.JPG]
   This is me in my new jacket getting ready to go for my first walk,
   after having all my injections.
   I was only 12 weeks old here and so excited to be going out into the
   big wide world.
   There are a lot of scary things out there, but my mum and dad took care
   of me and I really enjoyed myself.
   Now as I am older I love going for walks. and I sit and stare at my mum
   to make her feel guilty, so that she takes me out
   [IMG_0083.JPG]
   This is Dougal and me all dressed up and ready for our very first
   Christmas. I have wings on but you cant' see them in this photo.
   Then after that came our fist birthday and we had doggy cake between
   us.It was lovely and we ate it all.
   I love Dougal and he is such good fun to be with whenever we go out.
   And each week we both go to Doggy Day Care and we love our "Aunty"
   Sally who takes care of us while our mums are working.
   [SAM_4587.JPG]
   Now this is me at One Year Old and haven't I grown up into a beautiful
   puppy.
   This is the look I give my mum that makes her feel guilty to take me
   out. It never fails and she always gives in ... even if it's raining a
   little.
   I haven't seen snow yet but I would like to, and then I can run around
   and roll in it and see how it feels.
   So maybe this winter we will get a little bit and then I can tell you
   how it feels to me.
   [IMG_0123.JPG] This is Dougal and I at two years old. Isn't he such a
   handsome boy
   We both go to the groomers regularly to have a bath and a haircut that
   keep us neat and tidy
   I like having a bath and I love going swimming and will take that
   chance whenever I can.
   [IMG_0107.JPG]
   And that brings us up to present day, Here I am just turned three years
   old on the 17th August and I look so pretty.
   I have lots of fun with my family and Dougal and I went on the walk up
   Snowdon with them all last weekend.
   Today I am going for my first lesson at agility training, and that will
   be another adventure that I can share with you later.
   My mum will have to run around with me as I am taught what to do. But
   when I went for trial run it was lovely and I enjoyed it very much.
   I was tired and hungry when we had finished but I can't wait to go
   again
   I will be back to tell you all about it
   See you soon
   Love Ruby xxx

Card & Gift Winner

   Hi Everybody,
   This is a more relaxing way to spend a Saturday than last week climbing
   up Snowdon and it has taken me the best part of the week before my calf
   muscles stopped hurting. But everybody has felt the same way and they
   are all much younger than me ... so it's not just because I am a fossil
   !!
   So the draw for yesterdays gift has been done and one name chosen as
   the winner and that is
   Maria  Alder
   so if you could email me please with your postal address to
   christina@card-making-magic.com
   I can send the gift to you.
   I hope you will enjoy playing with it and please let me know when you
   have the gift safe and sound.
   My apologies about the video not working properly. It was my fault
   entirely by not adding the link correctly but it is now working as it
   should if you would like to go and view it.
     Festive Foliage
   More tomorrow ...

Papercraft Society Full Reveal ...

   Hi Everybody,
   Craft Stash have decided to put out a video to tell you all what is in
   the Papercraft Society Box, and as you may already know I am the first
   designer to be featured in this monthly kit.
   Janette has done a fantastic job showing it to you and if you ordered
   your subscription then I hope you wont be too upset that it is being
   shown early. But we have had so many enquiries about what is inside
   that the video was done. Some people you see don't like surprises !!
   Now if you do like surprises then you don't have to view this so either
   way the choice is yours .... but whatever you decide I don't think you
   will be disappointed

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/nw6_tN5ZP_Q

   Have fun with your Papercraft Society Box when it arrives and don't
   forget to show us what you have done with it. And most of all thank you
   for buying it without knowing what was in it or who was the designer of
   the kit in the first place
   More tomorrow ...
   Hugs xx

A5 Rectangular Nesting Set

   [SAM_8421.JPG]
   Hi Everybody,
   These are just some of the boxes that you can create from the 14 piece
   Rectangular Nesting Set.
   They are part of my new collection of A5 dies and they are available at
   Craft Stash
   In the video I have tried to show the different ways that this set can
   be used to create layers and frames for all your projects.
   But you can also make some pretty boxes complete with lids which are
   especially useful with Christmas on the way.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iIGScSbcCs

     A5 Rectangular Nested Set
   The video will show you how I got all three of these boxes from the one
   set of dies and they are perfect for adding any kind of gift too.
   The smaller dies can make personalised messages, verses or names to add
   to the box and you can decorate them however you would like to suit
   your recipient

Card & Gift Winner

   Hi Everybody,
   After a really lovely weekend I am back at home and as soon as I can
   get the photos off my phone I will share them with you. I am sad to say
   that I didn't make it to the summit. I got just over half way and then
   I had to admit defeat. It was really tough going and my ankles and back
   where so sore.
   But it was a lovely day and the weather was very kind to us.
   But now that I am back at home I have added all the comments to the
   page and a winner has now been selected to be the new owner of the
   Piece by Piece Jigsaw Die
   The winner is ...
   Connie Griffin
   would you email me your postal address please to
   christina@card-making-magic.com
   and the gift will be in the post to you
   Please let me know that you have it safely and I hope you have fun with
   it
   More tomorrow ...
   Hugs xx

Friday Freebie - Piece by Piece

   [SAM_8392.JPG] Hi Everybody,
   Today's gift is this fun little Jig Saw Die Set called Piece by Piece.
   It's not a big jigsaw but it is cute to add to your cards.
   I store mine on a small piece of magnetic sheet so that I don't lose
   any of the pieces that are in the set.
   The video Piece by Piece will show you some of the fun ways that I have
   used it to make bright and cheerful cards
   If you would like to have this set then all you need to do is leave me
   a comment at the end of the post with your FULL NAME please.
   One name will be chosen from those comments so be sure to come back and
   check

Please Note

   If you have followed my blog for some time then you will know that my
   husband Griff was a very proud Welshman and one of the things that he
   wanted to do this summer was walk up Snowdon with Ruby our Cocker
   Spaniel
   Sadly he died last November but this weekend, as a family we are all
   going to Wales to attempt that walk in his memory. There will be the
   combined families and five dogs so wish us luck.
   The draw won't  be done now until next week and I won't be contactable
   for a few days. No mobile phone connection and no WiFi. Please don't
   worry if your comments are not showing as I cannot moderate them and
   add them.
   But they will be done fully before the draw is done ... giving you a
   little extra time to enter if you wanted this gift and giving everybody
   a fair chance
    PLEASE DO NOT add your comment more than once just because it hasn't
   shown up
   Hugs xx
