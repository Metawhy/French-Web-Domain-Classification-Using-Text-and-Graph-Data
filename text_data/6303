Xiaomi’s smart home products now work with the Google Assistant

   May 11, 2018
   by Xiaomi Team

   Xiaomi’s unique ecosystem approach has created a comprehensive suite of
   products that are centered on our smartphones and include mobile
   peripherals, smart hardware and lifestyle products ranging from rice
   cookers to fitness trackers. Currently, Xiaomi has invested in more
   than 90 IoT and lifestyle companies and, together, we have been able to
   make a positive impact on many industries.

   However, we want to do more. As we seek to bring even more convenience
   to our users around the world, we understand that deepening our
   collaboration with partners is key. With this goal in mind, Xiaomi
   announced during Google I/O 2018 that our smart home products will now
   work with the Google Assistant, allowing users to control products
   through a smart speaker, like the Google Home, or with the Google
   Assistant app.

   The initial selection of compatible products includes Mi Bedside Lamp,
   Mi LED Smart Bulb and Mi Smart Plug, which will be coming to the U.S.
   shortly. More information about each product can be found below:

   Mi Bedside Lamp has 16 million color customizations and can be
   configured to fit any environment or mood. In addition to the
   touch-sensitive panel at the top and the Mi Home app, users can now use
   the Google Assistant to control Mi Bedside Lamp through voice control.

   Mi LED Smart Bulb will add color to any room, supporting up to 16
   million colors. With support for the Google Assistant, users no longer
   have to get out of bed to turn off the lights and can also control
   brightness and color temperature verbally.

   Turn any product into a smart device with Mi Smart Plug. This smart
   Wi-Fi plug allows users to turn power on and off using an app or by
   simply asking the Google Assistant and enables consumers to issue a
   voice command to their favorite “non-smart” gadgets.

   These smart home products will be available in the U.S. shortly,
   starting with Mi Bedside Lamp in May. Stay connected with Xiaomi on
   Facebook and Twitter to find out more details about price and
   availability.
