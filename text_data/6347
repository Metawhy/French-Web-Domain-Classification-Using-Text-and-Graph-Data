Graham's Potted History

   I'm a potter and experimental archaeologist, that means that I create
   replicas of ancient pots, make reconstructions of ancient kilns,
   firings, workshops etc. This blog is a journal of some of my recent
   work. All text and images are copyright if you wish to use them please

Potted History On Screen

   In terms of media work, it's been a busy couple of years and I'll be
   linking to a few of the resulting videos in the coming months, this one
   was made for English Heritage, Stonehenge, for whom you may recall from
   earlier posts, I made the replica Grooved Ware and Beaker pottery
   displayed in the Stonehenge Visitor Centre Museum and in the replica
   Neolithic Houses. This obviously shows a very much speeded-up version
   of the creation of a Neolithic Grooved Ware pot, but it does give an
   idea of the processes involved. Early in 2019 I'll be starting a
   subscription Vlog in which I'll produce monthly lecture/demo videos
   taking you through all aspects of Prehistoric Pottery making. I'll go
   into detail on everything from the selection and preparation of
   materials, the making and use of authentic tools, forming and
   decorating many different types of Neolithic, Bronze-Age and Iron Age
   pottery and the firing process. If you'd be interested to hear more
   about this, or keep informed about forthcoming workshops and replicas,
   sign up to my Mailing List. Or to book onto one of my one day workshops
   have a look at our website Potted-History.co.uk

Prehistoric and Anglo Saxon Pottery Workshops

   [2018-10-23%2B13.35.42.jpg]
   When I talk about making Prehistoric Pottery, Neolithic, Bronze-Age and
   Iron-Age, or indeed Post Roman Anglo Saxon/Early Mediaeval  ceramics, I
   often get the response "Oh, that's coiled isn't it?".  Coiled pottery
   is a term that jars with me, it conjours in the mind images of primary
   school classrooms with pots made of little clay sausages, gradually
   falling apart as they dry. The range of techniques used by potters
   before the Romans introduced the potters' wheel to Britain and in the
   centuries after Roman Rule ended, are wide and varied, they are robust
   and were carefully chosen to create strong, functional vessels. The
   same is true of their choice of tools, materials and firing method.  In
   a one day workshop, I can't teach you everything there is to know about
   Ancient Ceramics, but I can give you a pretty good grounding in the
   basic methods, I can show you how to select the best materials for the
   job and I can get you to make a couple of decent replicas. The first
   three workshops at our Rothbury Studio, for 2019, are now available for
   booking on our website

The Writing Is On The Pots

   I always say that I have a constant stream of new commissions that
   keeps me on my toes, often sending me off to my library to research a
   new technique or genre, but I think this is the first time that I've
   been asked to add Latin inscriptions to pieces that I've made. That's
   exactly what the Ashmolean Museum, Latin Inscriptions Project asked me
   to do, firstly in creating a full Arretine Ware, Terra Sigillata,
   (Samian Ware) production set: Punches, Mould and Finished Bowl.
   [2017-11-19%2B17.43.48.jpg]
   [2017-11-20%2B09.43.21.jpg]
   Then there was the beautiful Victory Lamp, bearing the greeting, ANNV /
   NOVM / FAVTVM / FELICE(M) Annu(m) / nov(u)m / fau(s)tum /felice(m)
   which translates as ‘A happy and prosperous New Year!’  In this case
   the museum asked for not only the lamp itself, but the mould that made
   the lamp and the archaetype that was used to make the mould, again
   providing an insight into the complete making process.
   [2017-11-21%2B11.55.54crop.jpg]
   And last but by no means least this set of Pan Pipes, or Syrinx. The
   brief did not require that the pipes should actually be able to be
   played, but as I had all the measurements I felt I should at least try,
   and they do in fact make quite a passable tune, which can be heard here
   https://youtu.be/zFLME8SZAvQ  All are now in use at the Ashmolean
   Museum in Oxford

Fragments: The Peregrini Lindisfarne Landscape Project


   [Composite.jpg]
   [2017-08-19%2B10.54.36sm.jpg] One of the biggest projects that I've
   been involved with this year, saw me returning to my roots as a
   craft/artist potter, but still with a strong history and heritage
   theme. This project explores the culture, heritage and landscape of the
   Holy Island of Lindisfarne just off the Northumberland coast.
   [2017-08-19%2B11.28.59%2BB%2526W%2Bsm.jpg] The project is described on
   the Peregrini website: “Fragments is a multi-disciplinary community
   arts project to celebrate Holy Island and the adjacent coast, and the
   experiences of those involved with the Peregrini Lindisfarne Landscape
   Partnership” and for my part involved “the creation of six ceramic
   pieces that evoke the area’s rich natural and cultural heritage” with
   the intention being to “create a legacy for the Creative Arts and
   Landscape Appreciation”.  Also creating work for this project were;
   photographer Jose Snook, and poet Katrina Porteous with whom I had
   several discussions and who kindly allowed me to include passages from
   her poems on my pots
   [2017-11-02%2B11.30.33%2528sm%2529.jpg] The project kicked off with a
   series of meetings with people who, in corporates talk, I suppose one
   would describe as “Stakeholders”.  I met with members of the local
   community, people from local history societies, wardens from the
   Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve, fishermen and many more.  From
   these meetings I gained a good understanding of what this landscape
   means to the people who live and work in it, and while there was no way
   I was going to be able to use all of the ideas generated, the
   experience gave me a really good starting point.  Beginning in August,
   I ran a series of clay sessions with community groups, giving each
   person the opportunity to create ceramic “fragments” that would form
   part of the final exhibition, and go on display alongside the vessels
   in Berwick Museum and Art Gallery in 2018. In addition each participant
   created their own “Fragment Vessel” which was fired and will be
   returned to them after the exhibition. Again, ideas and designs gleaned
   from these workshops have helped to inform the design of the final
   vessels.
   Peregrini Fragments Vessels
   [2017-11-30%2B16.35.42.jpg] [2017-11-17%2B14.16.08%2Bsm.jpg] When
   Archaeologists excavate a site what they find are fragments of the
   material culture of past civilisations but they are also the fragments
   of peoples lives.  Likewise palaeontologists find the fragments of
   fossils. Many visitors to this coast spend at least a few minutes
   picking up sea-worn fragments of pottery and may find along our beaches
   sherds that date back as far as the early Neolithic, 6000 years ago,
   broken clay pipes smoked by sailors and coal miners as they plied their
   trades, pieces of blue and white porcelain that graced the Sunday
   tables of fishermen and women at the end of an arduous working week,
   and fragments of stoneware pop bottles discarded by children after a
   trip to the beach.
   [2017-12-07%2B12.52.53.jpg]
   I've been a potter all my life, always aware that the vessels I create
   will remain in existence, even if only in fragmentary form, for many
   thousands of years, I have made my mark, left my legacy. But
   eventually, clay being a natural material, the forces that made the
   clay in the first place will grind these pots to dust and return them
   to the earth.  Most of my work over the past fifteen years has involved
   working with Museums and Archaeologists to replicate the pottery of
   ancient cultures. More often than not this process begins with me
   handling and interpreting a few small fragments of original
   [2017-12-07%2B12.48.53.jpg]
   pot.  This is what I call “Having a conversation with the original
   maker” I feel a real bond with my predecessors.
   Almost every element of these pots has been shaped by the input that I
   have had from the community groups, with whom I worked during the
   development stages of this project.  It would however have been
   impossible to incorporate every memory, story, legend, important
   building, object, feature, character, animal, plant, etc., the final
   “edit” is therefore my own, so if I have missed out anything vital
   please forgive me.  I would however point out that I didn't want these
   vessels to be a “one glance” event, I want you to work to find the
   secrets and connections that they hide, and I hope that there are many.
   So if you  don't find what you are looking for on your first visit to
   these pots, go back for a second and third look.
   Cocklawburn Vessel
   The form of this vessel was inspired a Bronze Age collared urn, but
   greatly stretched in length, the decoration on its surface is in layers
   or strata, as it became clear during the community sessions that most
   of the things that people remembered about Cocklawburn were connected
   to its geology. Included within the design you will find references to
   the lime burning industry, coal mining, the railways and farming, but
   also more recent use of this landscape for recreational purposes. Look
   out for fossils including the now famous Rhizodont.
   [2017-12-07%2B13.26.09.jpg] [2017-12-07%2B13.26.54.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B13.27.08.jpg]
   Sea Vessel
   Taking it's form from a Post Mediaeval Jug and topped by a traditional
   Northumbrian Fishing Coble, albeit much forshortened.  The sea is many
   things to many people, especially those who live on an island and I've
   tried to capture some aspects of the sea in this vessel.  The lines of
   Katrina Porteous poem not only describe the tide but for me the
   describe human impact on the landscape!
   [2017-12-07%2B12.51.56.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B12.51.45.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B12.52.16.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B12.52.08.jpg]
   Sanctuary Vessel
   Based loosely on a traditional slipware country pottery figure group,
   atop a blue and white pottery vessel, ceramic colours that dominate
   many of the fragments found along the shoreline.  I've tried to
   represent the idea of refuge, safety, tranquillity and sanctuary, from
   war, religious persecution and everyday life.  The lines from Katrina
   Porteous poem “Refuge Box” dominate this vessel.
   [2017-12-07%2B13.00.38.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B13.00.25.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B13.00.54.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B13.00.47.jpg]
   Myths & Legend Vessel
   In the form of an Anglo Saxon Urn, this vessel incorporates fragments
   of stories myths and legends, from Cuthbert's Beads and the Laidley
   Worm, through the Franks Casket and visions of Dragons to the legend of
   the Glass Beach created by one of the youngest participants in the
   Community Workshops.
   [2017-12-07%2B12.47.35.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B12.47.03.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B12.48.29.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B12.48.53.jpg]
   [2017-12-07%2B12.48.07.jpg]
   Conflict and Defence Vessel
   This vessel is in itself a fragment, a sherd,  broken and wounded.  In
   it you'll find references to conflicts ancient and modern.
   [2017-11-30%2B19.42.54.jpg]
   [2017-11-30%2B19.41.39.jpg]
   [2017-11-30%2B19.42.25.jpg]
   Teeming With Life Vessel
   What it says on the pot!  In the form of an egg, itself the prototype
   form for most pots. You will really have to search the surface of this
   vessel to find all its secrets just as, when you walk in the landscape,
   you know it's teeming with life but it's often very difficult to see.

Firing The Vindolanda Kiln

   On May 31st I, with the help of two of the stalwart Vindolanda
   volunteers, fired the newly built replica Roman pottery kiln at the
   Vindolanda Museum: See my earlier post Roman Pottery Kiln and Workshops
   at Vindolanda.
   [2017-05-31%2B07.26.56%2B%25281024x681%2529.jpg]
   [2017-05-31%2B08.32.09%2B%25281024x681%2529.jpg]
   44 pots of varying sizes were packed tightly into the chamber,
   tile/amphora sherds (actually roughly made curved slabs of fired clay)
   were then laid over the pack.  On top of this a very coarse mix of mud,
   gravel and organic material was spread and finally I plastered a mix of
   sand and clay over the surface, leaving three exit flues at the back of
   the kiln, through which hot gasses could escape.
   I'd made the decision to attempt a black-burnished ware / greyware
   firing which involves starving the kiln of oxygen towards the end of
   the firing causing an intensely reducing atmosphere within the chamber.
    This has the combined effect of pushing carbon deep into the pores of
   the clay and converting iron oxide within the clay body from its red
   Ferric form to black Ferrous oxide.  In the case of this firing this
   was achieved by closing down some of the exit flues for the last 200
   degrees and, once we had reached the target temperature of 900 degrees,
   completely sealing the top of the kiln then stoking as much fuel as
   possible into the firebox and then sealing it closed.
   [2017-05-31%2B16.06.05%2B%2528681x1024%2529.jpg]
   The kiln was lit at 8:30am and we began sealing the kiln at 6pm giving
   a total firing time of nine and a half hours and an average temperature
   rise of 95 degrees per hour. Once begun, firing is a continuous
   process, even being distracted for a few moments can result in a
   temperature drop. As a 21st Century potter I have the advantage of an
   thermocouple and pyromenter (High temperature thermometer) my Roman
   predecessors would have had no such technology at their disposal.
   Their temperature measuring techniques would have relied on their
   senses: in the early stages of firing a potter needs to take things
   very slowly, ensuring that trapped moisture in the clay doesn't blow
   his/her pots apart, a hand placed over the exit flue will give an
   indication of temperature and whether the gasses are moist or not; once
   the kiln is over 600 degrees C the colour of the pots in the chamber,
   seen through the exit flues will give the potter all the information
   they need.
   [2017-05-31%2B16.38.10%2B%25281024x681%2529.jpg]
   [2017-05-31%2B16.17.20%2B%25281024x681%2529.jpg]
   [2017-05-31%2B18.00.01%2B%2528681x1024%2529.jpg]
   I arrived to open the kiln at noon the following day and upon opening
   one of the exit flues was surprised to smell smoke, and by the level of
   heat emanating from the kiln. I realised that the fuel in the firebox
   had converted to charcoal and that, with the influx of oxygen caused by
   opening the seal, it was about to reignite.  We therefore opened the
   firebox and immediately raked out all the accessible fuel which did
   indeed immediately burst into flame. We then resealed the kiln because
   the pots were obviously too hot to unpack, unfortunately not having
   anticipated this turn of events, I had not brought the pyrometer with
   me and there fore while I knew it was hot, I didn't know how hot!  If
   fired pots are cooled through the 250 to 200 degrees stage too quickly
   they can crack, known as "dunting", this is caused by the fact that
   silica molecules within the clay rearrange themselves at 226 degrees,
   so it's safest to wait till the kiln is below 200 degrees to open it.
   After a trip to my workshop to collect the pyrometer, we returned to
   the kiln at 4pm by which time the temperature was 186 degrees  and the
   decision was taken to open it.
   [2017-06-01%2B15.10.11%2B%25281024x681%2529.jpg]
   [2017-06-01%2B16.28.20%2B%2528681x1024%2529.jpg]
   I think the results speak for themselves, everything was well coloured
   by the reduction, the variations from pale grey to black being very
   much in keeping with Roman originals.  If you'd like to own one of the
   pots from this firing watch the Vindolanda website and my Blog for
   news, or drop me an email and I'll let you know when they come up for
   sale.

About Me

   pottedhistory
          Rothbury, Northumberland, United Kingdom
          When I handle an ancient pot it’s a little like shaking hands
          with the original potter; a handshake across thousands of years.
          I can feel the impressions made by their thumbs, the pressure of
          their fingers pushing the wet clay into the palm of the hand to
          swell out the belly of the pot, the sweep of a tool to decorate
          the surface. All of these movements are like frozen, or possibly
          more correctly, fired moments in time, preserved and waiting for
          me to decode. When I come to emulate their actions and re-create
          one of these prehistoric masterpieces, I get to know the potter
          a little better. A conversation takes place … “Oh I see why you
          did that” ….”What did you use to make that mark?”.........”Now
          that’s clever, decorating it like that”. The conversation may
          seem a little one sided but the answers come back to me from the
          clay. Above all the act of making a piece gives me a deep sense
          of respect for a fellow craftsperson.
