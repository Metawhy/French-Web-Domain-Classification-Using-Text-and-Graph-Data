   "The people are the best part of Zendesk. I mean, our products are
   pretty great too, obviously. But the most rewarding part of my job is
   getting the opportunity to collaborate with smart, interesting people
   from across the globe." Avi Warner Alexa Herasimchuk​​​​​​​

   lighting is incredibly flattering." Avi Warner

Culture

   We believe in a healthy work-life balance. While we work very hard at
   what we do, we also want you to have room for family, friends, and, of
   course, yourself. At Zendesk, we keep sane work hours so that we can
   pursue our passions outside of the office.
   We also believe in giving back. Zendesk employees are active in our
   respective neighborhoods, working to amplify the great qualities that
   already exist in our local communities. We volunteer regularly and are
   proud to help those in need.

Perks and benefits

   Zendesk offers competitive salaries and an excellent benefits package
   for full-time employees. This includes time off, referral bonuses,
   patent bonuses, and educational opportunities for your career
   development. And fully stocked kitchens, happy hours, shiny new
   technology, and the occasional pleasure of seeing executives dressed in
   holiday costumes make the in-house perks pretty sweet, too.
   Rest and relaxation

We understand that you have a life outside of work. That means plenty of PTO
for full-time employees—and plenty of couches for a change of scenery or to
step away from your desk.

   Health and wellness

Health is more than medical coverage for you and your family. You can
participate in yoga or bootcamp fitness classes, and enjoy access to healthy
produce, snacks, and a wellness discount program.

   Learning and development

There’s never an end road for professional development. Full-time employees
are reimbursed with our education program when they attend a professional
conference or take courses to develop new skills within their career.

   Planning for the future

Sometimes life happens and events take us by surprise. No matter what the
occasion, our benefits package keeps you covered — with a 401K match, 16
weeks of maternity/paternity leave, disability and life insurance.

Awards and recognition
