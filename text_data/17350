Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?

   Last updated on: 8/17/2018 | Author: ProCon.org

   Around seven out of ten Americans (69%) use social networking sites
   such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest, as of
   2018, up from 26% in 2008. [26] [189]. On social media sites, users may
   develop biographical profiles, communicate with friends and strangers,
   do research, and share thoughts, photos, music, links, and more.

   Proponents of social networking sites say that the online communities
   promote increased interaction with friends and family; offer teachers,
   librarians, and students valuable access to educational support and
   materials; facilitate social and political change; and disseminate
   useful information rapidly.

   Opponents of social networking say that the sites prevent face-to-face
   communication; waste time on frivolous activity; alter children’s
   brains and behavior making them more prone to ADHD; expose users to
   predators like pedophiles and burglars; and spread false and
   potentially dangerous information. Read more background…

Social media spreads information faster than any other media.

     78.5% of traditional media reporters polled used social media to
     check for breaking news. [190] 59% of Twitter users and 31% of
     Facebook users polled followed breaking news on these sites. [191]
     Social media sites are one of the top news sources for 46% of
     Americans, compared to 66% for television, 26% for printed
     newspapers, and 23% for radio. [192] Social media users have been
     responsible for reporting events before traditional media outlets,
     including the Paris attacks in France on Nov. 13, 2015 (Twitter,
     Facebook, and Vine), [193] the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria and Sierra
     Leone in July 2014 (Twitter), [194] the Boston marathon bombing on
     Apr. 15, 2013 (Twitter), [195] and the Aurora, CO, theater shooting
     on July 20, 2012 (Twitter and YouTube). [3] President Donald Trump
     said that the immediacy that Twitter affords him is the reason why
     he tweets, noting that press conferences and press releases take too
     long to reach the public. [271] Read More

Law enforcement uses social media to catch and prosecute criminals.

     73% of federal, state, and local law enforcement professionals
     surveyed think "social media helps solve crimes more quickly." [196]
     A survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police found
     that 85% of police departments use social media to solve crimes.
     [199] The New York Police Department was one of the first forces to
     add a Twitter tracking unit and use social networking to arrest
     criminals who have bragged of their crimes online. [6] Social media
     sites have helped in the prosecution and conviction of a number of
     crimes, including: a professional soccer player charged with
     inappropriate activity with a minor in the UK in 2016, [197] a gang
     charged with the beating of a gay couple in Philadelphia, PA, in
     2014, [198] and rioting hockey fans in Vancouver (Canada) in 2011.

     Portland, Oregon, introduced a social media program to engage
     students, grades went up by 50%, chronic absenteeism went down by
     33%, and 20% of students school-wide voluntarily completed
     extra-credit assignments.[10][11] A Jan. 2015 study published in the
     Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology said college freshman

Pro 8

Social media facilitates face-to-face interaction.

     People use social media to network at in-person events and get to
     know people before personal, business, and other meetings. [23] Pew
     Research Center's Internet and American Life Project found that
     messaging on social media leads to face-to-face interactions when
     plans are made via the sites and social media users messaged close
     friends an average of 39 days each year while seeing close friends
     in person 210 days each year. [24] Read More

Pro 9

Social media increases voter participation.

     Facebook users reported they are more likely to vote if they see on
     social media sites that their friends voted. [25] Amongst students
     who are somewhat, not sure, or unlikely to vote, 35% stated that
     social media was most likely to influence them to vote in the 2016
     presidential election; this was higher than all other mediums
     including television (30%), radio (14%), print (9%), and direct mail
     (6%) or email (5%). [210] During the 2012 presidential election, 22%
     of registered voters posted about how they voted on Facebook or
     Twitter, 30% were encouraged to vote by posts on social media, and
     20% encouraged others to vote via social networking sites. [27] Read

Pro 10

Social media facilitates political change.

     Social media gives social movements a quick, no-cost method to
     organize, disseminate information, and mobilize people. [28]
     Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,
     Florida, used social media to mobilize a gun control movement
     following a deadly shooting at their school. The student activists
     used Twitter to promote nationwide protests on Mar. 24, 2018 that
     drew over one million participants and registered thousands of new
     voters. [280][281][282][283] The 2011 Egyptian uprising (part of the
     Arab Spring), organized largely via social media, motivated tens of
     thousands of protestors and ultimately led to the resignation of
     Egyptian President Mubarak on Feb. 11, 2011. [29] A July 4, 2011
     tweet from @Adbusters with the hashtag #occupywallstreet started the
     American Occupy movement. [30][211] In 2015, the Black Lives Matter
     grassroots campaign addressed racism and police brutality in the
     United States and successfully pressured the 2016 presidential
     candidates to publicly address the issue. [212] Read More

Pro 11

Social media is good for the economy.

     Social media sites have created a new major industry and thousands
     of jobs. [31] A McKinsey Global Institute study projected that the

     billion and $1.3 trillion to the economy through added productivity
     and improved customer service. [32] A report by Deloitte found that
     "Facebook added $227 billion and 4.5 million jobs to the global
     economy in 2014." [214] Facebook posted $5.38 billion for first
     quarter 2016 revenue, up from $3.54 billion for first quarter 2015

     began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. [270] Read More

Pro 12

Social media sites empower individuals to make social change and do social
good on a community level.

     Social media shares popularized nine-year old Scottish student,

     of her school's lunch program prompting international attention that
     resulted in changes to her school and the formation of "Friends of
     Never Seconds" charity to feed children globally. [35][141]
     Jeannette Van Houten uses social media to find owners of photographs
     and mementos strewn from houses by Hurricane Sandy. [36]
     Hillsborough, CA, freshman varsity soccer goalie Daniel Cui was
     blamed for and bullied about a losing season until over 100 of his

Social media helps senior citizens feel more connected to society.

     According to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, the 65 and older age
     group is one of the fastest growing demographic groups on social
     media sites, with usage rising from 2% of seniors in 2008 to 35% in
     2015. [215] Seniors report feeling happier due to online contact
     with family and access to information like church bulletins that
     have moved online and out of print. [39][40] Read More

     shy, 28% report feeling more outgoing, and 20% report feeling more
     confident (53% of teens identified as somewhat shy or "a lot" shy in
     general). [14] Youth who are "less socially adept" report that

information from reputable sources.

     The US military and Department of Veterans Affairs use social media
     to help prevent suicide. [46] The World Health Organization (WHO)
     uses social media to "disseminate health information and counter
     rumours," which was especially helpful after the Mar. 2011 Japanese
     earthquake and nuclear disaster when false information spread about
     ingesting salt to combat radiation. [47] The Boston Health
     Commission used social media to get information to its 4,500 Twitter
     followers about clinic locations and wait times for vaccines during
     the H1N1 outbreak. [48] Read More

     surrounding mental health and learning disabilities. [49] The Stigma
     Project uses Facebook to "lower the HIV infection rate and
     neutralize stigma through education via social media and
     advertising." [50] Gay people speaking openly on social media, like
     Facebook site Wipe Out Homophobia, help achieve a greater social
     acceptance of homosexuality. [51][52] Jenny Lawson, author of the
     blog "The Bloggess" and New York Times bestseller Let's Pretend This
     Never Happened, has made public her struggles with OCD, depression,
     and anxiety disorders, which has lessened the stigma of the diseases
     for others. [53] Read More

people access to previously unavailable educational resources.

     Information previously restricted to academia's "ivory tower" can
     now be shared with the public who do not have access to restricted
     journals or costly databases. Researchers from a wide variety of
     fields are sharing photos, providing status updates, collaborating
     with distant colleagues, and finding a wider variety of subjects via
     social media, making the research process and results more
     transparent and accessible to a larger public. [59][139] Read More

Pro 19

Corporations and small businesses use social media to benefit themselves and
consumers.

     85% of fans of brands on Facebook recommend the brand to others and
     71% of internet users are more likely to purchase from a brand that
     they are following on social media. [220] Almost 90% of big
     companies using social media have reported "at least one measurable
     business benefit." [61] In 2015, 98% of Fortune 500 companies used
     social media. [219] Amongst these corporations the most popular
     sites were LinkedIn (used by 93% of companies), Glassdoor (87%),

     students. [66] Educators from around the world interact with each
     other and bring guest teachers, librarians, authors, and experts
     into class via social media sites like Twitter and social networking
     tools like Skype. [67][68] Edmodo, an education-specific social

Social media offers a way for musicians and artists to build audiences even
if they don’t have a corporate contract.

     [70] 64% of teenagers listen to music on YouTube, making it the
     "hit-maker" for songs rather than radio (56%) or CDs (50%). [71][72]
     Pop star Justin Bieber was discovered on YouTube when he was 12

Pro 23

Social media allows for rapid communication during crisis events.

     Over one-third of federal, state, and local law enforcement
     professionals surveyed say that they use social media to notify the
     public of emergencies or disasters. [196] Facebook allows users in a
     crisis region to mark themselves as safe and check to see that
     friends and family are safe, [224] such as after the Apr. 2015 Nepal
     earthquake, the Sep. 2015 Chile earthquake, and the Nov. 2015 Paris
     terrorist attacks. [225] During the Paris terrorist attacks,
     Parisians tweeted their personal address alongside the hashtag
     #PorteOuverte (French for "open door") to offer shelter to people
     who were stranded. [225] In the aftermath of the Sydney café hostage
     situation in Australia in Dec. 2014, local residents tweeted their
     routes to work with the hashtag #IllRideWithYou to offer support to

     64% of people who use Twitter for news say that they have
     encountered something they "later discovered wasn't true," and 16%
     of Twitter news users say that "they had retweeted or posted a tweet
     they later discovered to be false." [227] A study published in the
     journal Science found that lies spread six times faster than the
     truth on Twitter, and "fake news" is retweeted more often than true
     news. [278] In the three months prior to the 2016 US presidential
     election, false news stories about the two candidates were shared a
     total of 37.6 million times on Facebook. [269] A federal grand jury
     indictment announced in Feb. 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller
     said that a Russian group created phony social media accounts "to
     reach significant numbers of Americans for purposes of interfering
     with the U.S. political system." [279] A University of Michigan
     study found that even when false information is corrected, the
     number of people who see or share the correction via social media is
     lower than number who saw or shared the false information in the
     first place. [272] Read More

Con 2

Social media lacks privacy and exposes users to government and corporate
intrusions.

     81% of people surveyed feel "not very" or "not at all" secure when
     using social media sites to share private information. [228] 48% of
     people reported some difficulty in managing their privacy settings.
     [229] 13 million users said they had not set or did not know about
     Facebook's privacy settings. [81] The US government submitted 36,812
     requests for data from Facebook and 7,036 requests from Twitter in
     2015, approximately 80% of which were honored at least in part.
     [230][231] The National Security Agency (NSA) can monitor social
     media activity and read the content of private social media messages
     simply by entering a person's username into their system. [232]
     Contego Services Group, which specialize in worker compensation
     claims, has a unit dedicated to social media monitoring to detect
     fraud. [233] Read More

Con 3

Students who are heavy social media users tend to have lower grades.

     31% of teens say that using social media during homework reduces the
     quality of their work. [235] Students who used social media had an
     average GPA of 3.06 while non-users had an average GPA of 3.82. [84]
     Students who used social media while studying scored 20% lower on
     tests. [84] College students' grades dropped 0.12 points for every
     93 minutes above the average 106 minutes spent on Facebook per day.
     [85] One study found that in schools which introduced a ban on cell
     phones, student performance improved 6.41%. [234] Another found that
     grades began a steady decline after secondary school students
     reached 30 minutes of daily screen time. After four hours, average
     GPAs dropped one full grade. [184] Read More

Con 4

Social media can lead to stress and offline relationship problems.

     31% of teens who use social media have fought with a friend because
     of something that happened online. [236] A 2016 study found that
     overuse of social media as an adolescent may decrease success in
     relationships later in life as online communication hinders the
     development of conflict management skills and awareness of
     interpersonal cues. [247] One study found that the more Facebook
     friends a person has, the more stressful Facebook is to use. [87]
     Researchers have found that "active Twitter use leads to greater
     amounts of Twitter-related conflict among romantic partners, which
     in turn leads to infidelity, breakup, and divorce." [238] Read More

Con 5

Social media can entice people to waste time.

     A survey of internet users aged 16-64 found that the average daily
     time spent on social media is 1.72 hours, which accounts for 28% of
     total time spent online. [239] 36% of people surveyed listed social
     media as the "biggest waste of time," above fantasy sports (25%),
     watching TV (23%), and shopping (9%). [90] When alerted to new
     social media activity, such as a new tweet or Facebook message,
     users take 20 to 25 minutes on average to return to the original
     task. In 30% of cases, it took two hours to fully return attention
     to the original task. [91] Read More

Using social media can harm job stability and employment prospects.

     Job recruiters reported negative reactions to profanity (63%), poor
     spelling or grammar (66%), sexual content (70%), and references to
     illegal drugs (83%), guns (51%), and alcohol (44%) on potential
     employees' social media. [241] 55% of recruiters report
     reconsidering hiring applicants based on social media activities.
     [241] Anthony Weiner, former US Representative, was forced to resign
     after a Twitter sexting scandal. [93] Curt Schilling, former

The use of social media is correlated with personality and brain disorders.

     A University of Pittsburgh study found that social media use was
     "significantly associated with increased depression" amongst adults
     aged between 19 and 32. [243] Another study found that addictive
     social media use reflected increased narcissistic personality
     traits. [244] Researchers have found that "interruptions due to
     phone notifications can cause inattention and hyperactivity in the
     general population." [246] A UK government study found that 41% of
     children who spend over three hours on social media on a normal
     school day reportedly suffer from mental health difficulties
     compared with 21% who spend no time on the sites. [245] Read More

Con 8

Social media causes people to spend less time interacting face-to-face.

     A USC Annenberg School study found that the percentage of people
     reporting less face-to-face time with family in their homes rose
     from 8% in 2000 to 34% in 2011. [98] 32% reported using social media
     or texting during meals (47% of 18-34 year olds) [99] instead of
     talking with family and friends. 10% of people younger than 25 years
     old respond to social media and text messages during sex. [100][173]

Criminals use social media to commit and promote crimes.

     Gangs use the sites to recruit younger members, coordinate violent
     crimes, and threaten other gangs. [101] Sex offenders use social
     media sites to find victims for sexual exploitation. [248][249][253]
     78% of burglars "admitted they use Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare,
     and Google Street View to select victims' properties," and 54% said
     that "posting status and whereabouts on social media is the most
     common mistake made by homeowners." [251] Social media has also led
     to the phenomena of "performance crimes," so called as participants
     film their crimes and upload them to social media. [250] Read More

Con 10

Social media can endanger the military, journalists, and activists.

     The US Army notes that checking in with location based services on
     social media like Foursquare or Facebook could expose sensitive
     whereabouts and endanger military personnel and operations. [104] In
     2015 a freelance journalist and activist was executed by the Islamic
     State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) for reporting on life under the
     regime via Facebook. [252] In 2015 and 2016, a number of Bangladeshi
     bloggers who posted their thoughts on atheism on social media were
     killed by religious fundamentalists who opposed their postings.
     [254] In 2011, a blogger was found murdered by a Mexican cartel with
     the note "this happened to me for not understanding that I shouldn't
     report things on the social networks." [106][140] Read More

Con 11

Social media harms employees’ productivity.

     A global online survey found that 50% of workers check or use social
     media at least once a day during work hours. [256] A survey of Irish
     workers found that 78% use a personal device to access social media
     at work. [257] Two-thirds of US workers with Facebook accounts
     access the site during work hours. [107] Even spending just 30
     minutes a day on social media while at work would cost a 50-person
     company 6,500 hours of productivity a year. [108] A Pew Research
     Center study found that 56% of workers who use social media for
     work-related purposes think it distracts them from the work they
     need to do. [255] Read More

Con 12

Social media facilitates cyberbullying.

     52% of students have reported being the victim of cyberbullying with
     84.2% naming Facebook as the site through which they have been
     bullied, followed by Instagram (23.4%), Twitter (21.4%), and
     Snapchat (13.5%). [259] 17.5% of male students and 21.3% of female
     students have admitted committing bullying behavior online. [259]
     54% of teens have witnessed cyberbullying including on sites such as
     Facebook (39%), Twitter (29%), YouTube (22%), and Instagram (22%).
     [258] Middle school children who are victims of cyberbullying are
     almost twice as likely to attempt suicide. [46] Adults can also be
     victims of cyberbullying, with social, familial, or workplace
     aggression being displayed on social media. [111] Read More

Con 13

Social media enables “sexting,” which can lead to criminal charges and the
unexpected proliferation of personal images.

     Almost 40% of teens report "sexting" - posting or sending sexually
     suggestive messages - with 22% of teen girls and 18% of teen boys
     posting nude or semi-nude photos. [261] As a result, teens and
     adults are being charged with possessing and distributing child
     pornography, even when the teen took and distributed a photo of
     him/herself. [113] 88% of private self-produced sexual images posted
     to social media are stolen by pornography websites and disseminated
     to the public, often without the subject's knowledge. [114] Read

Con 14

People who use social media are prone to social isolation.

     Social media can exacerbate feelings of disconnect (especially for
     youth with disabilities), and put children at higher risk for
     depression, low self-esteem, and eating disorders. [42] The "passive
     consumption" of social media (scanning posts without commenting) is
     related to loneliness. [115] Read More

Con 15

Social media aids the spread of hate groups.

     A Baylor University study examined Facebook hate groups focused on
     President Barack Obama and found a resurgence of racial slurs and
     stereotypes not seen in mainstream media in decades. [119] A study
     of English-language Twitter posts found that around 10,000 tweets
     per day contained racial slurs, 30% of which were deemed derogatory.
     [264] Social media can create a "'radicalization echo chamber' where
     followers reinforce for each other extremist propaganda and calls
     for violence," says John Carlin, JD, Assistant Attorney General at
     the Justice Department. [263] The Christian Identity, a faction of
     the white supremacist group Aryan Nations, uses social media to
     recruit members [121], and Die Auserwahlten, a skinhead crew founded
     in Nebraska, was created by people who had met each other on social
     media. [264] Read More

Con 16

Children may endanger themselves by not understanding the public and viral
nature of social media.

     The 2012 film Project X, about an out of control high school house
     party due to social media promotion, prompted copycat parties across
     the US resulting in arrests for vandalism, criminal trespassing, and
     other offenses. [122] Up to 600 Dutch riot police had to be called
     in to break up a teen's birthday party to which about 30,000 people
     were accidentally invited after a Facebook post thought to be
     private went viral. [123] A similar incident happened in Los Angeles
     and resulted in the teen host beaten and hospitalized. [124] Read
     More

Con 17

Social media enables cheating on school assignments.

     Students in California, New York City, and Houston posted photos of
     standardized tests to social media sites, allowing students who had
     not yet taken the tests to see the questions (and potentially find
     answers) ahead of time. [82] The SAT has had similar problems with
     students posting parts of the exam to social media. [125][126] In
     Mar. 2015, two students in Maryland were accused of cheating on the
     10th grade Common Core tests by posting questions on Twitter.
     Pearson, a company that administers standardized tests, identified
     76 cases of students posting test materials online spanning six
     states in the first three months of 2015. [185] Read More

Con 18

Social media sites’ advertising practices may constitute an invasion of
privacy.

     An ExactTarget marketing report tells companies, "When a user clicks
     on a [Facebook] like button belonging to your brand, you're
     immediately granted access to additional information about this
     customer, from school affiliation and workplace information to their
     birthdate and other things they like… [M]arketers can access and
     leverage data in ways that will truly alarm customers." [127] From
     social media sites, simple algorithms can determine where you live,
     sexual orientation, personality traits, signs of depression, and
     alma maters among other information, even if users put none of those
     data on their social media profiles. [128] Read More

Con 19

Social media can facilitate inappropriate student-teacher relationships.

     The Texas Education Agency (TEA) opened 222 cases about
     "inappropriate relationships" between educators and students in the
     2015-16 school year; 86 cases were investigated in 2007-2008 and
     education experts blame the rise of social media for this increase.
     [124][265] Pamela Casey, a District Attorney in Alabama who has
     prosecuted teachers who had relationships with students, says that
     social media adds to the problem: "We say and do things on social
     media and cell phones that we wouldn't say and do in person... As a
     result, there's a wall that's been removed." [130][186] Read More

Con 20

Unauthorized sharing on social media exposes artists to copyright
infringement, loss of intellectual property, and loss of income.

     According to Business Insider, "illegally uploaded videos routinely
     clock up tens of millions of views, and hundreds of thousands of
     shares" with profits going to those who shared the content rather
     than those whose created it. [275] YouTube vloggers report that
     unauthorized sharing of their videos on Facebook is costing them
     millions of dollars in lost profits with one reporting $20,000 in
     lost profits from just one video. [277] Photographer Daniel Morel
     was awarded $1.2M in damages after Getty Images and AFP were found
     to have willfully infringed his copyright by selling photos he had
     posted on social media without his permission. [276] Read More

Con 21

Using social media can harm students’ chances for college admission.

     College administrators scan Facebook profiles for evidence of
     illegal behavior by students. [134][135] A 2016 Kaplan Test Prep
     survey found that 35% of college admissions officers checked an
     applicant's social media to learn more about them, up from 10% in
     2008. 42% of these admissions officers discovered information that
     had a negative impact on prospective students' admission chances.
     [76][266] In 2014, only 3% of students surveyed believed the content
     of their social media presence could hurt their prospects of
     admission. [76] Read More

Con 22

Social media posts cannot be completely deleted and all information posted
can have unintended consequences.

     The Library of Congress has been archiving all public tweets from
     Twitter's Mar. 2006 inception forward. [267] Information about an
     affair posted on Facebook, for example, can lead to and be used
     against someone in divorce proceedings because the information, once
     posted, can never be completely deleted. 81% of members of the
     American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML) said that they have
     seen in a rise in the use of social media as evidence in divorce
     proceedings with Facebook being cited as the primary source in 66%
     of divorce cases. [268] Read More

Con 23

Social media users are vulnerable to security attacks such as hacking,
identity theft, and viruses.

     Social media sites do not scan messages for viruses or phishing
     scams, leading to large-scale problems like the virus Steckt.Evl
     spread from Facebook's chat window. [138] 68% of social media users
     share their birth date publicly, 63% share their high school name,
     18% share their phone number, 12% share a pet's name; each of those
     pieces of information is frequently used for account security
     verification and can be used for identity theft. [103] Read More

                               Did You Know?
   1. Social networking sites are a top news source for 27.8% of
   Americans, ranking below newspapers (28.8%) and above radio (18.8%) and
   print publications (6%). [1]
   2. Students who used social networking sites while studying scored 20%
   lower on tests and students who used social media had an average GPA of
   3.06 versus non-users who had an average GPA of 3.82. [84]
   3. 35 global heads of state, every US Cabinet agency, 84% of US state
   governors, every major candidate for US President, and more than 40% of
   top global religious leaders are on Twitter. [157]
   4. 10% of people younger than 25 years old respond to social media and
   text messages during sex. [100] [173]
   5. In July 2012 Americans spent 74.0 billion minutes on social media
   via a home computer, 40.8 billion minutes via apps, and 5.7 billion
   minutes via mobile web browsers, a total of 121.1 billion minutes on
   social networking sites. [147]
