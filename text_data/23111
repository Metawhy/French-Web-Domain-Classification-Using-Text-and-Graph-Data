   HAPPY BIRTHDAY GREG!!! (Birthday back from Greg’s daughter) The earth
   has been around for 4.5 billion years. 4.5 BILLION YEARS!!! For some,
   the biggest mystery of our world is how it came to be. For me, the
   biggest mystery of our world is simply how it survived for
   4,499,999,939 years without my Dad. 61 years ago, the world met Greg.
   The guy who, at 61, still sees this world through childlike eyes. The
   guy who sees a world of silver linings and glasses half full. A world
   of imagination and curiosity and wonder, constantly basking at the
   beauty it has to offer. The guy who loves to explore his own inner
   world as much as the one outside. The guy who could make this world
   shake with his booming, contagious laughter. The guy who believes that
   the world has beautiful things to offer us and that what we put out
   into it, we’ll receive back tenfold. Dad, you’ve shown us the world,
   given us the world, and we’re so lucky to be part of yours. We love you
   and Happy Birthday!!!

   I have this print! We were going through a hard time in our lives and
   it meant so much to us. It hangs in our living room and is a constant
   reminder that He is with us through every difficult time we go through!

   if this is not the truth may god have mercy on your so called thinking

   Beautiful Painting

   Amen, we grow spiritually thru trials and tribulations in knowledge and
   understanding about life and living. If we didn't have that, we would
   be lukewarm, a liberal left DEMOCRAT!!

   Always we get to know Jesus at the most difficult time in our lives.

   Get faced with Stage 4 Breast Cancer and see how fast you get right
   with God!

   I can remember a little girl who so many times felt alone, scared,
   unwanted and only felt safe when she would pray to the God and Father
   that her grandma told her about. That love of Jesus has stayed with me
   through over 90 years and i treasure my relationship with Him more than
   anything in this life of mine.

   Loves Unconditionally and never ending..

   Amen. Love this picture. Patricia Randall.

   Amen? Nice love for God as I ling he helps not many days and many
   years? 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏

   Yes so very true in time of trouble he’ll be there for us his love is
   unconditional!!

   Amen for sure love you God ❤❤🙏🙏

   Beautiful photo. God Bless you . Amen

   Amen 🙏

   Such a beautiful picture tells the whole story

   My favorite picture! Such meaning❤️

   Love this painting.

   And through blessings if you pay attention!

   Amen

   Sooo true amen

   Amen and Amen

   Amen amen thank you odor Jesus

   Amen

   Amen.

   I've always wondered is it wrong or show lack of faith or belief, if we
   only reach out to Christ when we are having difficulty?

   I love this pic that Greg paints of Him. The light coming thru the door
   tells me He is seeking whoever is at that home.

   Thank you Jane , that is beautiful!!

   Your relationship does not end with your conversion, it's only begun.
   Believe means, rely on, cling too, and trust in. Cast all your care
   upon the Lord, for He careth for you. Without faith it is impossible to
   please God. Trust him with your problems. (2 Cor. 1:3-4) and you will
   grow in faith.

   This is one of my all-time favorite paintings. So grateful for the
   message this painting sends to all of us.

   I noticed 2 people laughed at this beautiful post of Jesus. I'm not
   supposed to judge anyone but, it makes me wonder if these people don't
   know our Lord and Savior. I feel sorry for anyone that doesn't believe
   in our Savior. I pray they get to know him before it's too late.

   I see that 4 people laughed at the beautiful portrayal of our Lord..I
   just don’t understand..hurts my heart..so much prayer needed for those
   who are so lost..🙏❤️

   I have also a beautiful photo of Jesus in my room knocking at a door to
   'someone.' If its me..."I welcome You Lord."🙏

   What a powerful name it is , Jesus my savior.

   My door is always open to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. I love
   you YAHSHUA. May God always bless you Greg Olsen and all your beautiful
   family and continue blessing you so prodigious hands. Amen 🙏🙏🙏

   Why are there trolls on this page, laughing? Why would someone take
   time out of their day to harass this page? It's a mystery to me.

   This is the verse that came to me the day the Lord saved me, a day I
   will never forget my life changed in the blink of an eye. Thank You
   Dear Lord for loving me more than I can ever imagine!!

   Fred's favorite picture by Greg Olsen! There is no door handle on the
   Lord's side! We must open it!

   Greg Olsen, you have out done yourself in this painting and scripture.
   Thank you for all you share with us. God Bless You!

   Ask and it shall be given. Thank you Lord. Amen

   This is my favorite picture

   He,s not going to knock forever answer it now while the spirit is
   calling you

   My door is ALWAYS open for you .

   I heard Jesus Knocking on the door of my heart and I shouted "come in!"
   Still sad about it.

   My son may not be the most religious, but it this happened he would
   invite him in, almost anyone, and feed them. He is a part of his
   grandfather Cookl

   Thank you Jesus for knocking at our hearts door so beautiful Greg ,

   Perhaps we shouldn’t be so condemning of the laughing emoji. Maybe the
   person was laughing joyously because Jesus knocked on the door of their
   heart!

   Jesus is welcome in my home and at my table all the time.

   You Are Welcome Come On In Sweet Jesus.

   Amen Lord Jesus my door is always open to you thank you for all you've
   done for me and my fellow brothers and sisters

   my favorite ...mySister Bev gave me This picture long time ago in my
   darkest Times !great message in this picture !☀️❤️♥️💙💚

   TOTALLY DEVINE😇💌💞 I have got the deck of cards with all your wonderful
   pictures of our friend, JESUS🥰💑 Love to pick a card every morning, more
   than reading the holy Bible - it feels more "alive" because of the
   devine pictures🎁💚💝 THANK YOU 👼💚

   Jesus, I Thank You For Your Love. All that You've Done for Us On the
   Cross at Calvery's Mountain. I Praise and Honor Your Holy Name. I Love
   You with All my Heart and my Soul and My Mind and My Strength. Amen.

   So beautiful! Brings a piece to me when I look at it.

   And gave up His life for us! Bill

   Gods love is beyond all understanding! He is the very essence and
   definition of the word itself!

   My Lord and my God. We love you. Thanks for what you did for us,

   He died for all our sins. Thank you Jesus

   Several years ago I bought this picture from you and had it framed. I
   became ill for some time and had to put my things in storage and live
   with my daughter to recover. While I was recovering, my storage locker
   was broken into and all my things were stolen, including this picture.
   I was devastated, but reordered and framed it again! It now hangs in my
   living room once again in a place of honor. I never get tired of
   looking at it! 💞 Thank you for sharing your God given talent!

   My favourite depiction of Christ!

   Yes HE did!! We are so blessed!!!

   Your pictures are awesome, full of love, peace and encouragement . Each
   one touches my heart and says it all. Thank you for sharing and I hope
   loss souls will be touched and will make the change and BELIEVE in Him.
   This is my favorite and it says it all. ❤️🙏❤️🙏

   Greg Olsen this is just beautiful. Love the verse!

   It’s that unconditional Love that brings people to Love Him as He first
   Loved is. The judgment and persecution will only drive people away When
   people finally realize what Jesus went through to show us that love
   that will fall before him in repentance. Jesus said I am come that they
   might have life and have it more abundantly

   Greg Olsen your work is amazing. I have some art drawings you have done
   also the temples.

   He's picture is on my walls I love having him in my house.

   Yes we love him because he first loved us.

   He Knew Of Us before Conception. Jesus chose His Sacrifice that through
   Him we will have Everlasting Life. For EVERY Knee SHALL Bow and EVERY
   Tongue SHALL Declare He IS GOD

   Your work is amazing 🙂

   Great Painting and so True. He first loved us.

   I love your work Greg. I need more walls.

   This is one of my favorite painting of yours💕

   What a beautiful picture, would love to have one

   We love him for all the sacrifices he has made simply because he loves
   us. He is an awesome God!

   He loves us all let his love be in you he cares for us let’s care about
   one another all over the World . Be kind for he is kind . Be forgiving
   He forgives ; ask him for forgiveness and for helping you to forgive.

   He is so beautiful and his work is so amazing
