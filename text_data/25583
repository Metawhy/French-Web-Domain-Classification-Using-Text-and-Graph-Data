   The core function of the Screening Group (SCR) at IARC is to provide
   data on the accuracy, reproducibility, efficacy, benefits, harmful
   effects, and cost-effectiveness of various early detection
   interventions for breast, cervical, colorectal, and oral cancers, among
   others, in reducing deaths and improving patients quality of life in
   various settings. These data can then be used to inform and improve the
   rational use of health-care resources. The Groups ultimate objective is
   to guide the development of public health policies for implementing
   screening in a variety of health-care settings, in particular in low-
   and middle-income countries (LMICs).

   SCR conducts field studies in LMICs to evaluate various early detection
   methods for breast, cervical, colorectal, and oral cancer control.
   These initiatives also address the means by which screening services
   could be scaled up through local public health services. SCR develops
   various training resources to catalyse and augment capacity building in
   close collaboration with national institutions and government health
   services. Through its research programme, SCR generates scientific
   evidence to support the development of resource-appropriate early
   detection policies and health systems for the delivery of effective
   early services. The Cancer Screening in 5 Continents (CanScreen5)
   project of the Group aims to collect information on characteristics and
   performance of cancer screening programmes around the world and
   disseminate such information for informed decision making in cancer
   screening programmes. For example, the Group significantly contributed
   also to the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of less than three
   doses of the HPV vaccine in protecting against cervical cancer.
