Super cool website alert

   speutschlish:

     fallenangelmeg:

     speutschlish:

     image

     lingvo.info is a cool, free website all about European languages &
     linguistics in general.

     There are four main sections to the website:
     * Lingvopedia for basic information about the 28 languages in Europe
       they focus on, like alphabet, history, phonetics, basic grammar,
       fun tongue twisters and sayings, etc.
     * Babylon for info on linguistic in general (as a prototumblinguist
       with barely any formal studies on linguistics, I‚Äôm eating this up)
     * Lingvopolis, which is like a searchable tumblr masterpost for
       language learning resources on the web
     * Geolingvo, which is a game you can play with some tumblr nerds all
       about langs and geography
     * There is also a section to download language lesson plans for
       teaching a couple languages!

     I saw one of the people who develops this website at the Polyglot
     Gethering, and their team is working hard on it! It‚Äôs super, super
     cool, and I wish we could have a clone site for all the languages.

     It‚Äôs also multilingual, so you can change the site language from
     English to 21 other languages.

     So I took a look, hoping this could give me information about and to
     learn a language I‚Äôve been wanting to learn for a while and just‚Ä¶
     you guys know Welsh is a language right? Like, Wales, the country
     attached to England, has it‚Äôs own language. Scotland too! (And if
     you can put that Ireland have their own language then you have no
     excuse for not putting Welsh and Scottish).

     Big disappointment.

     They do have resources for Welsh listed in Lingvopolis!

     I went to a talk by one of the developers of this website. They are
     based in Slovakia and get limited funding to develop this website in
     addition to many others like lernu.net for Esperanto, deutsch.info
     for German and slovak.eu for Slovak. Their team is multilingual, but
     of course not proficient in all languages, so they have to rely on
     volunteers from other countries to develop quality content for each
     language. That‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt quite get all the languages they
     would want to have on the site! If you know any Welsh speaker that
     would be interested in working with them long-term, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd
     be interested in hearing from that person. Though, this isn‚Äôt their
     main job, so the different sites they run are at different spots on
     the priority list. They‚Äôre also developing a site for Russian!

     The best thing about all these sites are - they‚Äôre free!

18 Wonderful literary devices to make wonderful essays

   leostudies:

    1. Allegory: When a great, often abstract concept is conveyed through
       a more corporal idea. I.e. Story with a deeper meaning (E.g.
       Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm/Communism)
    2. Allusion: Author refers to place, event or work by a way of passing
       reference.
    3. Amplification: Writer embellishes sentence by adding more
       information to increase its worth and understandability
    4. Analogy: Relationship based on similarities between two concepts.
    5. Anthropomorphism: Giving human quality to an animal
    6. Archetype: Reference to a specific concept or person or object that
       is immediately identifiable.

How to make the best lecture notes of all time

   lawlibrarycreature:

   image Sometimes you leave a lecture with the impression that very few
   of the important points raised in class have ended up in your notes.
   We‚Äôve all been there. Follow this nifty guide and make awesome notes
   every class‚Ä¶

PREPARE FOR CLASS

   Dull and predictable as this piece of advice is, if you prepare for a
   class, you‚Äôll get more out of it. Before the lecture, do the required
   readings and quickly scan the notes you made in the last class. This
   will provide a context for the new material you‚Äôll be learning and
   means you can focus your note-taking energies on subject areas you are
   not already familiar with. Why would you want to make lecture notes
   about material that‚Äôs in the textbook?

ORGANISING YOUR NOTES

   Date all your notes, give each lecture a topic title, and use subtitles
   where necessary. Avoid writing your notes on scraps of paper: write all
   your notes in the one notebook, or save all typed notes to the one
   folder on your laptop. This will help you to find what you‚Äôre looking
   for in a hurry.

WHAT TO USE

   In lectures some people prefer to type their notes, others write them
   out by hand. Find a system that works for you and keep it consistent.

   For me, the process of physically writing out my notes helps me to be
   more selective about which pieces of information I record, and helps me
   to better focus on the information presented. Plus the temptation of
   Facebook when I‚Äôm working on a laptop is just too great. I‚Äôve also
   found that using a Dictaphone or other recording device isn‚Äôt the best
   idea, as it makes you lazy in lectures and means you‚Äôre more likely to
   tune out.

   If you do write your notes out by hand, consider using coloured pens
   (not blue or black) as it can help you to retain more information first
   go. Using a different colour pen for key points makes them stand out in
   your mind.

WHAT TO WRITE DOWN

   Be selective. You don‚Äôt need to write down everything the lecturer
   says, and your notes shouldn‚Äôt be a transcript of the class. Don‚Äôt
   write a sentence if a few words will suffice.

   Limit your lecture note taking to material that you don‚Äôt already know
   (because you‚Äôve done your readings before class, this means your notes
   will probably be quite short). Listen closely and consider whether the
   information is relevant to the course and the assessments.

   In an information-packed lecture, it can be hard to know what
   information is important. Look out for:
     * Emphasis ‚Äì you‚Äôll pick this up from the time your lecturer devotes
       to a particular point, the way your lecturer says something, or the
       body language they use when saying it.
     * Repetition ‚Äì it they say something several times, it‚Äôs probably
       because they want you to learn it.
     * Definitions
     * Things written on the whiteboard/ blackboard
     * Debates ‚Äì Does your lecturer go into the reasoning behind the
       majority and minority judgments? The case is probably an important
       authority.

CREATE YOUR OWN ABBREVIATIONS

   Using abbreviations will help you to take notes more efficiently. Use
   abbreviations that mean something to you and keep it consistent. Here
   are some of my frequently used abbreviations:

   HCA         High Court of Australia

   SC           Supreme Court

   ct            Court

   P            Plaintiff

   D            Defendant

   judg        Judgment

   apl          Appeal

   maj         Majority

   min         Minority

SOME HANDY HINTS

   Writing the information in your own words, rather than copying the
   lecturer‚Äôs wording will help you to grasp and retain the information.

   Use dot points, indents and numbering to make the hierarchical
   relationship between different points clearer.

   Spread your notes out ‚Äì leaving space makes your notes easier to scan,
   and it‚Äôs helpful if your lecturer has a tendency to jump around.

   If the lecturer has moved onto a new point and you haven‚Äôt gotten
   something down, just leave a few question marks next to the incomplete
   thought and fill in the gaps with a friend after class.

CONSIDER COLUMNS

   Another option for making your notes more study-friendly, is dividing
   the pages of your notebook into columns. Here are the two best column
   strategies:
    1. Divide the page into two columns. The right one should take up
       about two thirds of the page, and the left column one third. Write
       your main lecture notes in the right column, and put keywords or
       topic headings in the left hand column. This makes it easier to
       find important information when you‚Äôre going through your notes
       later.
    2. Divide the page into two columns of equal width. Write points from
       your readings in the left column, and related points from your
       lecture in the right column. If you‚Äôve ever struggled with
       integrating your readings and your lecture notes, this is the
       strategy for you.

HAVE AN AFTER CLASS ROUTINE

   Type your notes up within 24 hours of the lecture. Turn key words and
   dot points into full sentences, and translate those abbreviations
   before you forget what they mean. Some studies have shown that if you
   revise the information within 24 hours of first hearing it, you‚Äôll
   remember about 80% of it. Such a simple routine could make exam time a
   whole lot easier.

     TIPS & TRICKS
    1. Studying in a blue room relaxes your mood and makes you more
       productive, which is great for finishing up assignments and
       homework.
    2. Spray an unfamiliar scent, and chew an unfamiliar flavour of gum
       while you‚Äôre having a study session.
    3. Before you start your exam, write down the things you think you
       might need while they‚Äôre still fresh in your head at the top of the
       page such as formulas and vocabulary words.
    4. ‚ÄòTimes New Roman‚Äô is the easiest and fastest font to read.
    5. When writing an essay, add the opposing point of view to make the
       read look at both sides.
    6. When you‚Äôre taking notes, pretend you‚Äôre writing them for some
       else, preferably someone you care about, and imagine them not
       knowing anything when it comes to the class you‚Äôre writing notes
       in.
    7. Using colours when writing your notes helps you remember faster,
       avoid using only one colour as it might dull out important
       information.
    8. Change your font from 12pt to 14pt when writing essays, it looks
       the same but increases the number of pages by 1-2.
    9. Cinnamon flavoured gum helps you stay awake, use it for your
       morning classes.
   10. Speaking something out loud helps your remember, so always read
       your notes aloud when you‚Äôre studying.
   11. Reading the first and last paragraphs and only running over the
       middle has the same outcome as reading all of it.
   12. Chocolate has the ability to improve your math skills.
   13. Always have an alternative email, you never know when it might come
       in handy.
   14. Cold showers over coffee anyway. It keeps you fresh the entire day,
       and also helps you stay focused and less tired throughout the day.
   15. Reward yourself with 15-20 minutes of free time with every 45
       minutes of studying.
   16. If you‚Äôre pulling an all nighter, sleeping the 20 minutes before
       the sun comes up helps your body relax and you‚Äôll be less tired.
   17. Replace the colour tube of your red pen with the blue one. No one
       steals a red pen, and no one wants it.
   18. Always say yes to extra credit, no matter what your grade is. It
       can make a huge different seeing as it has the ability to change
       one percent which can change an entire grade letter.
   19. ALWAYS DATE YOUR NOTES // ASSIGNMENTS.
   20. Writing something down is an equivalent of saying something 7
       times.
   21. No matter how much time you have left, do it earlier. You‚Äôll be
       glad you did.
   22. Be friends with your teachers, you never know what can happen
       during the school year.
   23. Have a study group, you‚Äôll have friends to explain things to you
       and vide versa, also you can share notes and finish up homework
       without feeling like time is passing by slow.

     And now an inspiring quote said by my biology teacher to one of my
     friends who wouldn‚Äôt stop looking at the clock, ‚ÄúThe time will pass,
     but you might not pass this class.‚Äù
