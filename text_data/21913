   Amelie Thank You

Merci à tous les rêveurs!

   Thank you so much for coming to our screening of Amelie on Saturday! It
   was wonderful to fall into the dreamy world of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's
   Paris all over again, and we loved talking about it with all of you
   afterward!

   If you liked what you saw and want more of the sepia-soaked city of
   lights, we've got some great recommendations for you at our médiatheque
   - stop by any time!
