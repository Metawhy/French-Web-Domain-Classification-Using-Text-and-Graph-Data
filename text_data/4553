   EIT Climate-KIC is a European knowledge and innovation community,
   working towards a prosperous, inclusive, climate-resilient society
   founded on a circular, zero-carbon economy.

   Keeping global temperature rise below 2˚C necessitates unprecedented
   change: new social dynamics, ways of doing business, capital flows,
   policymaking, economic models, and new ways of living. No one
   organisation can solve climate change on its own.
   We catalyse the rapid innovation needed across sectors by convening the
   brightest minds to tackle challenges, empowering leaders through
   capacity building, and seed funding the most promising climate-positive
   businesses.

   Leveraging collective knowledge and expertise for systemic change

   We are a knowledge and innovation community: we bring together partners
   from the worlds of business, academia, and the public and non-profit
   sectors to create networks of expertise, through which innovative
   products, services and systems can be developed, brought to market and
   scaled up for impact. Through our convening power, EIT Climate-KIC
   finds and supports transformational innovation that can lead to
   systemic change.

   Research & Innovation Programmes
   Building a climate action movement

   EIT Climate-KIC runs a range of inspirational education programmes
   across Europe and online for students, postgraduates and professionals.
   These programmes develop their participants’ skills and capacities,
   empowering them with up-to-date knowledge and best practice. In this
   way, we are fostering a new generation of entrepreneurs and climate
   leaders to realise a zero-carbon economy.

   Education Programmes
   Transforming ideas into climate-positive businesses

   We support innovation, whatever its source: from large corporations,
   research institutes and public bodies through to start-ups and
   individual entrepreneurs. Our incubator programme, Accelerator, gives
   structure and assistance to start-ups and SMEs. Through initiatives
   like our 24-hour hackathon Climathon, or our cleantech ideas platform
   Climate Launchpad, we encourage fresh new thinking from beyond the
   mainstream to build a movement of climate action.

   Urban
   Transitions

   Cities account for 70 per cent of worldwide emissions, but they are
   also at the heart of the solution.

   We actively accelerate the transformation of buildings, infrastructure
   and transport systems to be low carbon and resilient.
   Learn More
   Sustainable
   Production
   Systems

   The industrial sector is responsible for a third of total global GHG
   emissions.

   We lay the foundations for carbon-neutral manufacturing systems and
   material flows in urban areas and industrial regions, through circular
   economy principles and creating added value among stakeholders.
   Learn More
   Sustainable
   Land Use

   Agriculture, forestry and other land uses account for 24 per cent of
   greenhouse gases emissions, second only to energy production.

   We pave the way for efficient, low-carbon agriculture, advancing the
   bio-economy, and building resilience into food and forest value chains.

   Decision
   Metrics &
   Finance

   There is no lack of finance - but there is a lack of bankable green
   assets.

   We develop metrics and financial mechanisms that matter in order to
   mobilise and redirect the finance needed to quickly scale-up climate
   action.

State of the Planet: DiCaprio’s Oscar – Renewables Record – Floating Solar –
COP21 Ratification

   Posts 04 Mar 2016

   Things are moving quickly as our planet makes the transition to a new,
   clean economy. You want to stay in the loop – but you’re busy, that’s
   why we keep an eye on the headlines for you!

Welcome to the first – 4 March 2016 – edition of the Daily Planet’s weekly
State Of The Planet.

   Don’t hesitate to send your tips and comments to @peter_koekoek or
   peter.koekoek@climate-kic.org.

China has set a new record with its 2015 solar and wind consumption.

   Good news from the world’s biggest polluter: “The latest figures
   confirm China’s record-breaking shift towards renewable power and away
   from coal,” Tim Buckley from the US-based Institute for Energy
   Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said in a statement picked up
   by Climate Home.

Meanwhile, Reuters reports China expects to lay off 1.3 million workers in
its state-controlled coal industry.

   The government hopes to employ the coal workers in different sectors.
   Two weeks ago, Bloomberg already reported that China spent a record
   $111 billion on the deployment of clean energy infrastructure in 2015,
   almost as much as the EU and US combined.

A company in the UK capital is set to break a different type of record by
floating what will be the biggest solar array of its kind.

   Not on the stock exchange, but on the Queen Elizabeth II reservoir in
   London. Clean Technica reports it will be the largest floating solar
   power system in Europe. Also in the UK, the Guardian reports that
   Energy UK, which represents the country’s ‘big six’ providers, made a
   major u-turn by announcing support for phasing out coal-fired stations.

The 34 million people who tuned in to the live Oscars broadcast this week
were treated to a call to climate action by none other than Leonardo
DicCaprio.

   The Titanic veteran finally won his first Oscar and NME reports how he
   used his thank you speech to stress: “Climate change is real, it is
   happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire
   species, and we need to work collectively together and stop
   procrastinating.”

There was also a direct link between the movie and our climate.

   DiCaprio won “Best Actor” for his role in The Revenant, which was
   mostly filmed in Alberta, Canada. Originally, the producers had planned
   to film the entire movie in Canada, but they had to film the final
   scenes of the movie on the snow-covered southern tip of Argentina –
   because it had gotten unexpectedly warm in Alberta. Bustle has the
   transcript of DiCaprio’s Oscar speech, and you can watch it in full on
   Youtube.

The Guardian had a look at how Leo became one of the world’s top climate
change activists.

   You may have heard his foundation has already provided at least $30
   million in funding for environmental projects and that he has attended
   public marches. But did you know he receives private tutorials in
   climate science from some of the world’s best researchers?

Of course you know of it, but have you actually read the Paris Agreement?

   If language ever was an excuse, it may not be anymore as the UN has now
   made it available in all of its six official languages: English,
   Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish.

The EU Commission has said it wants Europe to ratify the Paris Agreement as
soon as possible.

   The Daily Planet reports the Commission has published its assessment of
   what the practical implications of the COP21 deal will be for Europe.
   In an accompanying statement, by Europe’s climate chief Miguel Arias
   Cañete said the EU should sign and ratify the agreement as soon as
   possible, and continue its “leadership in the global transition to a
   low-carbon future.” Fiji was recently the first country to formally
   approve the 195-nation agreement, reports the Guardian.

Environmental groups initially said the assessment doesn’t go far enough and
should introduce policy changes to make sure Europe can meet its obligations.

   But following clarifications made by national ministers later in the
   week showed the assessment may only be a starting point for further EU
   climate action. Greenpeace EU climate and energy policy adviser Bram
   Claeys said in a statement: “It may have surprised the Commission, but
   country after country has come out in support of stronger European
   efforts to tackle climate change. This should reboot Europe’s climate
   ambition. It’s a clear signal the Commission cannot ignore.”

US president Barack Obama and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will
sign a continental environment and climate change strategy, reports The Globe
and Mail.

   Both leaders are set to meet in Washington D.C. next week. Canada’s
   climate change minister, meanwhile, broke out in laughter in the House
   of Commons last week after reminding her conservative critic of the
   good times they had in Paris at COP21, reports the Huffington Post. The
   country is on the verge of adopting a national climate change strategy,
   reports CBC news. Prime minister Trudeau’s Liberal Party published a
   high-energy video on YouTube this week summarising how the strategy
   would work.

A new cross-sectoral public private group in Canada received a government
boost this week.

   The group consists of business leaders, labour, non-governmental
   organizations, government and academics who want to accelerate Canada’s
   transition to a high-efficiency, low carbon economy, reports The Herald
   News. Not a moment too soon, as it turn out. Yahoo News reports that
   unless something is done, Canada will by 2050 be a “land of climate
   change extremes.”

Political chaos in Europe and the US – should climate activists worry?

   Climate action is heavily dependent on politicians working together to
   get things done. In his Washington Post column, journalist and author
   Fareed Zakaria writes that across the West “governments that occupy the
   center ground find themselves struggling against energized ideological
   movements from right and left. The problem is that although they may be
   competent, centrists are dull, practical types. And there is always a
   search for romance in politics.”

But romantic solutions aren’t always real solutions.

   “The radicals and romantics might not have the power to overturn the
   centrist consensus, but they can place it under relentless pressure.
   Meanwhile, there is no discussion of the important issues and the
   actual, plausible policy options to deal with them.” Zakaria ends on a
   – somewhat – positive note, however: “The center can and does hold, but
   just barely.” YouTube also has a video of Zakaria reading out his
   column on CNN.

Looking for something to fix?

   Some of these stories may just inspire your next business venture:
     * We urgently need better climate modeling, Nicholas Stern has said.
       Nature reports the British climate scientist called on scientists,
       engineers and economists to help policy makers by better modelling
       the immense risks to future generations, and the potential for
       action.
     * A new study demonstrates how important it is to prevent methane
       leaks. New Republic reports that in California a leak in a gas
       storage facility poured 100,000 tonnes of methane into the air –
       equivalent to annual emissions from half a million cars.
     * Did you know El Niño is causing a global food crisis? This year’s
       El Nino has wreaked havoc on food supplies across Africa, Asia and
       Latin America. Climate Progress reports it will continue to do so
       for months to come.
     * Here’s a diplomatic challenge for you. The EU is withholding a €12
       million contribution to COP22 – due to take place in Moroco later
       this year – in a row over Rabat’s claim on the Western Sahara
       reports Climate Change News.
     * The economic impact of sea level rise will be huge. Reuters reports
       that a new study from Climate-KIC partner the Potsdam Institute for
       Climate Impact Research shows that as sea levels rise, “threatening
       cities from New York to Shanghai,” the economic damage will
       increase even faster than previously estimated.
