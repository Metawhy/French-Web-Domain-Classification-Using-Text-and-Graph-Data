Born to

     * Fight
    Fight
       From high speed dogfights to intense FPS warfare, battles can occur
       anytime, anywhere. So whether you're chasing down ruthless bounties
       or raiding civilian cargo haulers, it'll be up to you to decide
       which side of the law you want to fall on.
       How to Play
     * EXPLORE
    EXPLORE
       The explorer builds a life on the pursuit of knowledge and
       discovery. They will seek out the unknown or sometimes just
       surrender to the thrill of getting lost. Whether it's a hidden
       outpost, a derelict ship or a beautiful sunset, explorers are eager
       to see what's waiting over that next ridge.
       How to Play
     * UNITE
    UNITE
       Be a part of something greater. Engage other players to crew a
       multi-crew ship or build a player-run Organization into an entire
       spacefaring fleet. Either way, the Star Citizen Universe is all
       about community. In here, your actions have consequences that will
       either draw cheers from players and NPCs or get you shot.
       How to play
     * Trade
    Trade
       Dive into a dynamic economy and seek your fortune. Traders are
       drawn to the thrill of amassing resources, currency and social
       status. Whether trading contraband on the blackmarket or building
       legitimate empires, the life of the trader requires
       resourcefulness, strategy and an entrepreneurial spirit.
