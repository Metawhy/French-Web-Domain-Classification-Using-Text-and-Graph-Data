   Plugins was no longer developed on [DEL: wordpress.org :DEL] but only
   on github.com

   sLa is a NGjI’s Team of Developers and Designers.

     Preferred PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS, simplicity in design and strict
     (extreme) optimization of code. Work with WordPress plugins and
     themes, phpBB, and others PHP based Projects.

   The first approach with “programming” since 1988 is with COBOL – BASIC
   – DB3. Remember AutoMenu? First Bar Games was Pacman, Adventures Monkey
   Island and Loom.

     “Life is worth too much to be insignificant…”
