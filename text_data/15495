   Assistant Professor, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern
   University

   Assistant professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern
   University, and Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO).

   How do we, humans, understand the world: categorize and accumulate
   our knowledge, and thereby innovate idea, culture, and technologies? Is
   there any universal mechanism that governs such innovation process that
   eventually generates both social and economic wealth across different
   societies? A common conceptualization of innovation in both the
   biological and socio-economic domains sees it as an adaptive process of
   recombinant search over a space of configurational possibilities. I
   develop a mathematical framework for recombinant search in the space of
   configurational possibilities supported strongly by empirical data. The
   better we understand the mechanism of innovation the better we
   understand the mechanism of wealth creation.

   Research goals: Develop a mathematical framework for economic growth
   through innovation and tacit knowledge accumulation based strongly on
   empirical data; Understand universality in the way humans categorizes
   the world, accumulate knowledge, and innovate new technologies.

   Fields: PhD and BA in Statistical Physics at Korea Advanced Institute
   of Science and Technology; Research fellow at the Mathematical
   Institute at University of Oxford; Institute for New Economic Thinking;
   applied mathematics, physics, network theory, urban scaling theory,
   urban economics, urban geography, knowledge spillover, linguistics,
   lexical semantics, innovation, science of science, economic growth
   theory; research fellow at Santa Fe Institute and Harvard Kennedy
   School.

David Krakauer

   President and William H. Miller Professor of Complex Systems

   David’s research focuses on the evolutionary history of information
   processing mechanisms in biology and culture. This includes genetic,
   neural, linguistic and cultural mechanisms. The research spans multiple
   levels of organization, seeking analogous patterns and principles in
   genetics, cell biology, microbiology and in organismal behavior and
   society. At the cellular level David has been interested in molecular
   processes, which rely on volatile, error-prone, asynchronous,
   mechanisms, which can be used as a basis for decision making and
   patterning. David also investigates how signaling interactions at
   higher levels, including microbial and organismal, are used to
   coordinate complex life cycles and social systems, and under what
   conditions we observe the emergence of proto-grammars. Much of this
   work is motivated by the search for 'noisy-design' principles in
   biology and culture emerging through evolutionary dynamics that span
   hierarchical structures.

   Research projects includes work on the molecular logic of signaling
   pathways, the evolution of genome organization (redundancy, multiple
   encoding, quantization and compression), robust communication over
   networks, the evolution of distributed forms of biological information
   processing, dynamical memory systems, the logic of transmissible
   regulatory networks (such as virus life cycles) and the many ways in
   which organisms construct their environments (niche construction).
   Thinking about niche constructing niches provides us with a new
   perspective on the major evolutionary transitions.

   Many of these areas are characterized by the need to encode heritable
   information (genetic, epigenetic, auto-catalytic or linguistic) at
   distinct levels of biological organization, where selection pressures
   are often independent or in conflict. Furthermore, components are noisy
   and degrade and interactions are typically diffusively coupled. At each
   level David asks how information is acquired, stored, transmitted,
   replicated, transformed and robustly encoded.

   The big question that many are asking is what will evolutionary theory
   look like once it has become integrated with the sciences of adaptive
   information (information theory and computation), and of course, what
   will these sciences then look like?

   Krakauer was previously chair of the faculty and a resident professor
   and external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. A graduate of the
   University of London, where he went on to earn degrees in biology, and
   computer science. Dr. Krakauer received his D.Phil. in evolutionary
   theory from Oxford University in 1995. He remained at Oxford as a
   postdoctoral research fellow, and two years later was named a Wellcome
   Research Fellow in mathematical biology and lecturer at Pembroke
   College. In 1999, he accepted an appointment to the Institute for
   Advanced Study in Princeton and served as visiting professor of
   evolution at Princeton University. He moved on to the Santa Fe
   Institute as a professor three years later and was made faculty chair
   in 2009. Dr. Krakauer has been a visiting fellow at the Genomics
   Frontiers Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and a Sage Fellow
   at the Sage Center for the Study of the Mind at the University of Santa
   Barbara. In 2012 Dr. Krakauer was included in the Wired Magazine Smart
   List as one of 50 people "who will change the World."

   David Krakauer also served as the Director of the Wisconsin Institute
   for Discovery, the Co-Director of the Center for Complexity and
   Collective Computation, and was a Professor of Genetics at the
   University of Wisconsin, Madison.

   How do we, humans, understand the world: categorize and accumulate
   our knowledge, and thereby innovate idea, culture, and technologies? Is
   there any universal mechanism that governs such innovation process that
   eventually generates both social and economic wealth across different
   societies? A common conceptualization of innovation in both the
   biological and socio-economic domains sees it as an adaptive process of
   recombinant search over a space of configurational possibilities. I
   develop a mathematical framework for recombinant search in the space of
   configurational possibilities supported strongly by empirical data. The
   better we understand the mechanism of innovation the better we
   understand the mechanism of wealth creation.

   Research goals: Develop a mathematical framework for economic growth
   through innovation and tacit knowledge accumulation based strongly on
   empirical data; Understand universality in the way humans categorizes
   the world, accumulate knowledge, and innovate new technologies.

   Fields: PhD and BA in Statistical Physics at Korea Advanced Institute
   of Science and Technology; Research fellow at the Mathematical

David Krakauer

   President and William H. Miller Professor of Complex Systems

   David’s research focuses on the evolutionary history of information
   processing mechanisms in biology and culture. This includes genetic,
   neural, linguistic and cultural mechanisms. The research spans multiple
   levels of organization, seeking analogous patterns and principles in
   genetics, cell biology, microbiology and in organismal behavior and
   society. At the cellular level David has been interested in molecular
   processes, which rely on volatile, error-prone, asynchronous,
   mechanisms, which can be used as a basis for decision making and
   patterning. David also investigates how signaling interactions at
   higher levels, including microbial and organismal, are used to
   coordinate complex life cycles and social systems, and under what
   conditions we observe the emergence of proto-grammars. Much of this
   work is motivated by the search for 'noisy-design' principles in
   biology and culture emerging through evolutionary dynamics that span
   hierarchical structures.

   Research projects includes work on the molecular logic of signaling
   pathways, the evolution of genome organization (redundancy, multiple
   encoding, quantization and compression), robust communication over
   networks, the evolution of distributed forms of biological information
   processing, dynamical memory systems, the logic of transmissible
   regulatory networks (such as virus life cycles) and the many ways in
   which organisms construct their environments (niche construction).
   Thinking about niche constructing niches provides us with a new
   perspective on the major evolutionary transitions.

   Many of these areas are characterized by the need to encode heritable
   information (genetic, epigenetic, auto-catalytic or linguistic) at
   distinct levels of biological organization, where selection pressures
   are often independent or in conflict. Furthermore, components are noisy
   and degrade and interactions are typically diffusively coupled. At each
   level David asks how information is acquired, stored, transmitted,
   replicated, transformed and robustly encoded.

   The big question that many are asking is what will evolutionary theory
   look like once it has become integrated with the sciences of adaptive
   information (information theory and computation), and of course, what
   will these sciences then look like?

   Krakauer was previously chair of the faculty and a resident professor
   and external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. A graduate of the
   University of London, where he went on to earn degrees in biology, and
   computer science. Dr. Krakauer received his D.Phil. in evolutionary
   theory from Oxford University in 1995. He remained at Oxford as a
   postdoctoral research fellow, and two years later was named a Wellcome
   Research Fellow in mathematical biology and lecturer at Pembroke
   College. In 1999, he accepted an appointment to the Institute for
   Advanced Study in Princeton and served as visiting professor of
   evolution at Princeton University. He moved on to the Santa Fe
   Institute as a professor three years later and was made faculty chair
   in 2009. Dr. Krakauer has been a visiting fellow at the Genomics
   Frontiers Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and a Sage Fellow
   at the Sage Center for the Study of the Mind at the University of Santa
   Barbara. In 2012 Dr. Krakauer was included in the Wired Magazine Smart
   List as one of 50 people "who will change the World."

   David Krakauer also served as the Director of the Wisconsin Institute
   for Discovery, the Co-Director of the Center for Complexity and
   Collective Computation, and was a Professor of Genetics at the
   University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The Growing Gap between our Physical and Social Technologies

   Collins Conference Room
   Working Group
   9:00 am – 5:00 pm
   July 30, 2018 – August 10, 2018

   This event is closed.

   Meeting Description: To what degree are our physical technologies
   outpacing our social technologies and systems? The central hypothesis
   of the workshop is that the widening gap between technological
   advancements and lagging cultural and social structures and
   institutions is causing a variety of complex societal stresses and
   problems. These include concerns about rising economic inequality,
   fears over job losses due to automation, the increasing power of
   digital monopolies, the rise of populism, growing criticism of
   democratic governance systems, loss of privacy and freedom,
   intensifying societal polarization, a loss of faith in experts and data
   sources, and growing dysfunction in key institutions. Looking further
   ahead, emerging technologies raise questions about what it means to be
   human itself.

   The workshop will mainly include scientists but also business and
   government leaders, as well as civic society organizations. The
   cumulative cross-disciplinary evidence produced during this workshop
   will be published in a book organized in chapters written by the
   participating experts. Further, a documentary film on the workshop
   topic is under way and we plan to engage a popular media outlet to help
   disseminate both the discussion issues and results.

   This working group is supported in part by The Nick and Leslie Hanauer
   Foundation.

Mirta Galesic

   Professor and Cowan Chair in Human Social Dynamics

   Mirta Galesic is Professor and Cowan Chair in Human Social Dynamics at
   the Santa Fe Institute, External Faculty at the Complexity Science Hub
   in Vienna, Austria, and Associate Researcher at the Harding Center for
   Risk Literacy at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in
   Berlin, Germany.

   She studies how simple cognitive mechanisms interact with properties of
   the external environment to produce seemingly complex social phenomena.
   In one line of research, she investigates how apparent cognitive biases
   in social judgments emerge as a product of the interplay of
   well-adapted minds and the statistical structure of social
   environments. In another, she studies how collective performance depend
   on the interaction of group decision strategies and network structures.
   A third line of research investigates opinion dynamics in real-world
   societies using cognitively-enriched models from statistical physics.
   And, she studies how people understand and cope with uncertainty and
   complexity inherent in many everyday decisions.

Geoffrey West

   Shannan Distinguished Professor and Past President, Science Steering
   Committee

   Geoffrey West is a theoretical physicist whose primary interests have
   been in fundamental questions in physics, especially those concerning
   the elementary particles, their interactions and cosmological
   implications. West served as SFI President from July 2005 through July
   2009. Prior to joining the Santa Fe Institute as a Distinguished
   Professor in 2003, he was the leader, and founder, of the high energy
   physics group at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he is one of
   only approximately ten Senior Fellows.

   His long-term fascination in general scaling phenomena evolved into a
   highly productive collaboration on the origin of universal scaling laws
   that pervade biology from the molecular genomic scale up through
   mitochondria and cells to whole organisms and ecosystems. This led to
   the development of realistic quantitative models for the structural and
   functional design of organisms based on underlying universal
   principles. This work, begun at the Institute, has received much
   attention in both the scientific and popular press, and provides a
   framework for quantitative understanding of problems ranging from
   fundamental issues in biology (such as cell size, growth, metabolic
   rate, DNA nucleotide substitution rates, and the structure and dynamics
   of ecosystems) to questions at the forefront of medical research (such
   as aging, sleep, and cancer). Among his current interests is the
   extension of these ideas to understand quantitatively the structure and
   dynamics of social organizations, such as cities and corporations,
   including the relationships between economies of scale, growth,
   innovation and wealth creation and their implications for long-term
   survivability and sustainability.

   He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and was one of their
   Centenary Speakers in 2003. He has been a lecturer in many popular and
   distinguished scientist series worldwide, as well as at the World
   Economic Forum. Among recent honors he was a co-receiver of the Mercer
   Award from the Ecological Society of America, the Weldon Memorial Prize
   (2005), Oxford University and the Glenn Award for research on Aging and
   the APS Szilard Award (2013).  In 2006 he was named one of Time
   magazine's "100 Most Influential People in the World" and his work
   selected as one of the breakthrough ideas of 2007 by the Harvard
   Business Review. He is the author of several books, a visiting
   Professor of Mathematics at Imperial College, London, and an associate
   fellow of the Said Business School at Oxford University.

   West received his BA from Cambridge University in 1961 and his
   doctorate from Stanford University in 1966, where he returned in 1970
   to become a member of the faculty. West is married to Jacqueline West,
   a psychologist in private practice; they have two children: Joshua, is
   an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at the
   University of Southern California and an Olympic silver-medalist.
   Devorah, is studying International Studies at Stanford.

Sidney Redner

   Professor

   Sid Redner received an A.B. in physics from the University of
   California, Berkeley in 1972 and a Ph.D. in Physics from MIT in 1977.
   After a postdoctoral year at the University of Toronto, Sid joined the
   physics faculty at Boston University in 1978.  During his 36 years at
   BU, he served as Acting Chair during two separate terms and also served
   as Departmental Chair.  Sid has been a Visiting Scientist at
   Schlumberger-Doll Research in the mid 80's, the Ulam Scholar at LANL in
   2004, and a sabbatical visitor at Université Paul Sabatier in Toulouse
   France and at Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in Paris.

   Sid's research interests lie broadly in non-equilibrium statistical
   physics and its applications to a variety of phenomena.  In recent
   years, he has worked extensively on the structure of complex networks,
   where he has developed new models and new methods to elucidate network
   structures.  He has also devoted considerable effort to formulate and
   solve physics-based models of social dynamics.  He continues to
   investigate problems of phase-ordering kinetics and has advanced our
   understanding of zero-temperature coarsening in Ising and Potts models.
    Sid has an enduring interest in diffusion processes and their
   applications in the natural world and in stochastic transport processes
   in disordered porous media.  As part of this latter line of research,
   he investigates fundamental aspects of first-passage processes.

   Sid has published more than 250 articles in major peer-reviewed
   journals, as well as two books: the monograph A Guide to First-Passage
   Processes (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2001) and the graduate text, jointly
   with P. L. Krapivsky and E. Ben-Naim, A Kinetic View of Statistical
   Physics (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2010).  He also a member of the
   Editorial Board for the Journal of Informetrics, an Associate Editor
   for the Journal of Statistical Physics, and a Divisional Associate
   Editor for Physical Review Letters.

Albert Kao

   Complexity Postdoctoral Fellow

   Omidyar Fellow, Baird Scholar

   Every biological organism is computational, gathering information about
   its immediate environment, recalling traces of past environments,
   processing noisy information, and making decisions about its next
   course of action. Albert is fascinated by the diversity of strategies
   that organisms have evolved to reliably make good decisions while
   constrained by limited resources and unreliable tools.

   The unique abilities available to collective systems are of particular
   interest to Albert, which, broadly defined, can include animal groups
   such as bird flocks, plant root systems, fungal networks, and human
   social networks. Such systems can potentially detect features of their
   environment invisible to spatially-constrained organisms, perform
   complex computations in parallel, and enhance their decision-making
   ability through consensus forming mechanisms. To understand the
   capabilities, and constraints, that collective systems face, Albert
   couples theoretical models and computational simulations with
   experiments on a wide range of organisms, including slime molds, army
   ants, fish, homing pigeons, and humans. Using this broad approach, he
   hopes to uncover both general principles common to collective systems,
   as well as specific solutions discovered by particular taxa.

   Prior to joining SFI, Albert Kao was a James S. McDonnell Foundation
   postdoctoral fellow. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University,
   supervised by Iain Couzin, and an A.B. in physics from Harvard College.
