CGS Europe

Pan-European coordination action on CO2 Geological Storage

   CGS Europe is a project funded within the 7th Framework Programme of
   the European Community for research, technological development and
   demonstration activities.

   CGS Europe pools together the expertise of the key research institutes
   in the area of CO2 geological storage in European Member States and
   Associated Countries. It sets up coordination and integration
   mechanisms between the CO2GeoNet Association - the European Network of
   Excellence on the Geological Storage of CO2 - and 23 other
   participants, thus covering most of Europe with 24 EU Member States and
   4 Associated Countries.

   CGS Europe provides an independent platform and reference source where
   national, European and international experts, institutes and regulators
   are able to access the most up-to-date results of CO2 storage-related
   studies, share experiences and good practices, discuss the
   implementation of regulations, identify research needs to face upcoming
   challenges, and build new projects.

CO2CARE

CO2 site closure assessment research

   CO2CARE aims to support the large scale demonstration of CCS technology
   by addressing the research requirements of CO2 storage site
   abandonment.

   It delivers technologies and procedures for abandonment and
   post-closure safety, satisfying the regulatory requirements for
   transfer of responsibility.

   The project focus on three key areas:
     * well abandonment and long-term integrity;
     * reservoir management and prediction from closure to the long-term;
     * risk management methodologies for long-term safety.

   Objectives are achieved via integrated laboratory research, field
   experiments and state-of-the-art numerical modelling, supported by
   literature review and data from a rich portfolio of real storage sites,
   covering a wide range of geological and geographical settings.

   CO2CARE aim is to develop plugging techniques to ensure long-term well
   integrity; study the factors critical to long-term site safety; develop
   monitoring methods for leakage detection; investigate and develop
   remediation technologies.

   Predictive modelling approaches are assessed for their ability to help
   define acceptance criteria. Risk management procedures and tools to
   assess post-closure system performance are developed. Integrating
   these, the technical criteria necessary to assess whether a site meets
   the high level requirements for transfer of responsibility defined by
   the EU Directive is established. The technologies developed are
   implemented at the Ketzin site and dry-run applications for site
   abandonment are developed for hypothetical closure scenarios at
   Sleipner and K12-B.

   Participation of partners from the US, Canada, Japan and Australia and
   data obtained from current and closed sites add to the field monitoring
   database and place the results of CO2CARE in a world-wide perspective.
   Research findings are presented as best-practice guidelines.
   Dissemination strategy consists in delivering results to a wide range
   of international stakeholders and the general public.

CO2Stop

CO2 Storage Potential in Europe

   CO2StoP is the acronym for the “CO2 Storage Potential in Europe.”
   project. The CO2StoP project, which started in January 2012 and ended
   in December 2013, was funded by the European Commission (Project N°:
   ENER/C1/154-2011-SI2.611598). The project covered data from 27
   countries1.

   The results of the study are provided as a database of CO2 storage
   locations throughout Europe, a Data Analysis/Interrogation Tool and
   GIS, and a tool to compute storage capacities and injection rates
   (StoreFit). The database is now housed by the Joint Research Centre -
   European Commission, Petten, the Netherlands
   (http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ ).

   The calculations made in CO2StoP from the current project database of
   CO2 storage locations throughout Europe paint a broad picture, but also
   identify the gaps in our knowledge. These gaps must be filled by
   further data entry, and, potentially, new geological studies, seismic
   surveys and drilling to make more precise data available.

   It is critically important to understand the assumptions that lie at
   the basis of the storage capacity estimates entered in the database.
   These are especially relevant for saline formations, the capacities of
   which were derived without taking into account regulatory or economic
   limitations.

   The CO2StoP methodology has made significant progress towards
   establishing probabilistic estimates of the CO2 storage resource in
   Europe in a way that will allow comparisons with other regions of the
   world to be made, and which will also be useful to policy makers.
   However, the partial data entry into the project database does make
   clear that the current project marks the beginning of the process of
   resource estimation, and certainly not the end.

ECO2

Sub-seabed CO2 Storage: Impact on Marine Ecosystems

   Sub-seabed CO2 Storage

   With this selection of study sites, each at a different operative
   stage, ECO2 will cover the major geological settings to be used for the
   storage of CO2 including depleted oil and gas reservoirs (B3 field
   site, 80 m water depth), saline aquifers located at the continental
   shelf (Sleipner, 90 m water depth), and the upper continental slope
   (Snøhvit, 330 m water depth, see section B1.3 for more detailed
   information on study areas). In response to the call, we have developed
   five key objectives for ECO2.

   Objectives
    1. To investigate the likelihood of leakage from sub-seabed storage
       sites
    2. To study the potential effects of leakage on benthic organisms and
       marine ecosystems
    3. To assess the risks of sub-seabed carbon dioxide storage (based on
       objectives 1 and 2)
    4. To develop a comprehensive monitoring strategy using cutting-edge
       monitoring techniques
    5. To define guidelines for the best environmental practices in
       implementation and management of sub-seabed storage sites (based on
       objectives 1 to 4)

ECO-BASE

Enhanced oil recovery with storage

   The objective of ECO-BASE (sponsored by ACT ERA Net Co-fund) is to
   develop detailed and integrated roadmaps for CCUS(carbon capture,
   utilisation and storage) based on EORStore concept, where EOR (enhanced
   oil recovery) is co-optimised with permanent storage.

   The project is focusing around three South-East European countries
   (Romania, Turkey and Greece) with support from Norway and the
   Netherlands. The roadmaps will be based on available data on sources
   and sinks and supported by state of the art optimization engineering
   and economic/tax modelling. The project will analyse several emitter to
   end-user value chains and prospective revenue streams in Southern-East
   Europe by providing roadmaps as preparation for pilot applications,
   thereby lifting the storage and utilization components of the CCUS
   value chain in SEE to TRL 4-5.

   The resulting roadmaps will include the way forward on technical,
   legal, economic and public levels for CCUS in general and to EORStore
   specifically. The cases will also serve as an example for Europe-wide
   application of CCUS.

ENOS

ENabling Onshore CO2 Storage in Europe

   The ENOS (ENabling ONshore CO[2] storage in Europe) project,
   coordinated by BRGM (France), was launched at the end of 2016 and will
   last for four years. It unites 29 organisations across 17 countries,
   and is financed by the European Union’s H2020 programme with a budget
   of 12.5 M€ as well as partners’ own funds. It is an initiative of
   CO[2]GeoNet, the European Network of Excellence on the geological
   storage of CO[2] (www.co2geonet.com). Eight of its members are involved
   in this project, namely: BRGM, BGR, CGS, CIUDEN, IRIS, OGS, TNO and
   UNIROMA La Sapienza.

   ENOS strives to enhance the development of CO2 storage onshore, close
   to CO2 emission points. Several field pilots in various geological
   settings will be studied in detail and best practices that stakeholders
   can rely on will be produced. In this way, ENOS will help demonstrate
   that CO2 storage is safe and environmentally sound and increase the
   confidence of stakeholders and the public in CCS as a viable mitigation
   option.

GeoCapacity

Assessing European Capacity for Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide

   The main objective of GeoCapacity is to Assess the European Capacity
   for Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide.

   The project has included full assessments of a number hitherto not
   covered countries, and updates of previously covered territory. Also a
   priority is the further development of innovative methods for capacity
   assessment, economic modelling and site selection criteria. Finally, an
   important mission is to initiate scientific collaboration with China
   and possibly other CSLF members. The GeoCapacity project has comprised
   all or parts of the sedimentary basins suitable for geological storage
   of CO2 and located within the EU and the Central and Eastern European
   new member states and candidate countries. In areas, which were part of
   the GESTCO project completed in 2003, the work has included only
   supplementary updates.

   The project is co-funded by the EU within FP6 - the 6th Framework
   Programme of the European Community for Research, Technological
   Development and demonstration activities, contributing to the creation
   of the European Research Area and to innovation (2002 to 2006).

RISCS

Research into impacts & safety in CO2 storage

   RISCS is a European project which aims to improve our understanding of
   the possible environmental impacts of geological storage of CO2. There
   are 24 organisations participating in RISCS including research
   institutions, industry environmental associations and the International
   Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas R & D Programme. The project is designed
   to study a wide range of potential impacts, thus providing tools for
   developing appropriate legislation and helping to ensure the safe
   management of CO2 storage sites.

   RISCS is a 4- year, EU and industry sponsored project, with focus on
   the potential environmental impacts that might be associated with CO2
   leakage from a storage site, even if such leakage is very unlikely.

   The project provides the essential research, through field work and the
   development and validation of appropriate models, to underpin
   frameworks for the safe management of CO2 storage sites. Research
   within the project is focused on understanding the potential
   likelihoods and consequences of impacts scenarios on key receptors such
   as human populations, ecosystems, and groundwater.

   A representative set of reference scenarios, encompassing the main
   types of impacts to living organisms that could be present, are
   investigated. This covers a range of CO2 storage options , both onshore
   and offshore, in a variety of geographical settings.

   RISCS aim is to communicate the research and the outcomes in an
   accessible way to stakeholders and the public. A key output of the
   project (and other related research) is a ‘Guide for Impact Appraisal’,
   developed in consultation with stakeholders.

SiteChar

Characterisation of European CO2 storage sites

   The three-year European SiteChar project (FP7), dedicated to set the
   criteria for characterisation of sites for geological storage of CO2,
   was launched in January 2011.

   SiteChar has examined the whole site characterisation process
   integrating site characterisation, risk assessment and development of
   monitoring plans. The workflow has been tested at a range of onshore
   and offshore, saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs,
   representative of various geological contexts and located across
   Europe. Detailed evaluation of site-specific techno-economic factors
   and injection strategies have been performed. Social site
   characterisation and public engagement activities have also been
   conducted. A key innovation is the development of dry-run licence
   applications.

   By advancing a portfolio of sites to a (near-) completed feasibility
   stage, developing a methodology for the preparation of license
   applications, incorporating all the technical and economic data, as
   well as societal aspects, SiteChar has provided a valuable tool for the
   roll- out of geological storage on an industrial scale in Europe.

   Coordinated by IFP Energies nouvelles, SiteChar gathers another sixteen
   partners from research, industry, and consultancy sector, from ten EU
   countries: AGH, BGS, ECN, ENEL, GEUS, GFZ, IMPERIAL, OGS, PGNiG,
   SINTEF-PR, Statoil, TNO, UfU, UniRoma1-CERI, Vattenfall and the
   Scottish Government. SiteChar is has been also supported by Veolia
   Environnement.

ULTimateCO2

Understanding the Log-Term fate of geologically stored CO2

   ULTimateCO2, a four-year collaborative project financed by the 7th
   Framework Programme and coordinated by BRGM, aims to shed more light on
   the long-term processes associated with the geological storage of CO2.

   ULTimateCO2 unites 12 partners (research institutes, universities,
   industrialists) and a varied panel of experts (NGOs, national authority
   representatives, IEAGHG, ….).

   Based on a multidisciplinary approach, and bringing together laboratory
   experiments, numerical modelling and natural analogue field studies,
   ULTimateCO2 will increase our understanding of the long-term effects of
   CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) in terms of hydrodynamics, geochemistry,
   mechanics of the storage formations and their vicinity.

   The project considers the three crucial elements of a storage site:

   Reservoir: All processes of multiphase flow and associated geochemical
   reactivity are studied through laboratory experiments and digital
   modelling in order to assess CO2 trapping mechanisms (structural,
   dissolution, residual, mineral), based on both hypothetical and real
   data.

   Caprock: A shaly caprock, potentially faulted or fractured, is studied
   in detail based on i) previous data on gas reservoirs in the North Sea
   that have shown leakage, ii) laboratory tests on shale cores altered by
   geochemical acidification, and iii) numerical modelling coupling
   geochemical alteration of shale and behaviour mechanics.

   Wellbore: The wellbore vicinity is a crucial zone for possible leakage
   compromising the long term efficiency and safety of a storage site. The
   project is undertaking a true scale experiment in the underground rock
   laboratory of Mont Terri in Switzerland to reproduce conditions of a
   well bottom in contact with brine acidified by dissolved CO2 during one
   year, with fluid sampling and continuous monitoring of permeability of
   the shale-cement-casing interface. Overcoring and extraction of the
   entire system will then enable detailed identification of any potential
   leakage paths and geochemical interactions of the interfaces.

BGR

Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe

   The Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) is
   the central geoscientific authority in Germany providing neutral and
   independent information and advice to the German Federal Government,
   the German parliament, national industry organizations and individual
   entitites. BGR also represents the Federal Republic of Germany in
   international geoscientific committees. It is subordinate to the
   Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and has a staff of
   around 750 people.

   BGR is one of the competent authorities in Germany according to the
   German CCS law and it is committed in international committees with
   relevance for CCS such as the ISO Technical Committee “Carbon dioxide
   capture, transportation, and geological storage” (ISO/TC265).

   BGR was one of the founding members of CO2GeoNet at the time of the EC
   contract and is now a cooperating partner of the CO2GeoNet Association
   as defined by a cooperation agreement.

   Since the year 2000, BGR has been investigating various aspects of the
   geological storage of CO2 in different locations and regions inside and
   outside Germany, partnered by national and foreign research
   institutions, geological surveys, and industrial partners. Research
   activities have focused on the following topics:
     * Storage options and potentials as well as interactions with other
       subsurface usages focusing on national assessments(e.g., projects
       Geothermal Atlas, Storage Catalogue of Germany, GESTCO,

BGS

British Geological Survey

   The British Geological Survey

   The British Geological Survey (BGS) was established in 1835 and is the
   United Kingdom’s national geological survey and one of the world’s
   major centres of geoscientific knowledge, expertise and excellence. It
   is the UK's premier provider of objective and authoritative
   geoscientific data, information and knowledge for sustainable use of
   natural resources, reducing risk and living with the impacts of
   environmental change. BGS is  a  public sector  organization
   responsible for  advising  the UK  government  on all  aspects  of
   geosciences, as well as providing impartial geological advice to
   industry, the public and academia. BGS is a component institute of the
   UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

   BGS is a world leader in the field of geological storage of CO[2]. It
   is the largest storage research centre in the UK with over 30 active
   researchers and a track record in CCS going back to 1991. Over the past
   two years BGS has carried out more than 60 CO[2] storage projects. Our
   current annual Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) turnover is
   £1.3M. For more information please see the CO[2 ]storage research pages
   on our website.

   Since coordinating the first EC funded CCS research and development
   project (Joule 2) BGS has played a major role in CO[2] storage research
   through projects funded by research grants from the European Commission
   (e.g. FP5, FP6, FP7, EuropeAid), UK funding (e.g. NERC, EPSRC,
   UKCCSRC), industry and through own funding. BGS has a seat on the
   Co-ordination Group of the UK CCS Research Centre (UKCCSRC) and
   provides two UKCCSRC Research Area Champions.  BGS is Storage
   Coordinator for the CCS Joint Programme of the European Energy Research
   Alliance (EERA) and is a founding partner of the CO[2]GeoNet
   Association.

   Examples of a few recent projects and roles are given below:

   The GeoEnergy Research Centre (GERC) is a pioneering joint venture
   co-founded by BGS and the University of Nottingham (UoN). As part of
   this partnership, the GeoEnergy Test Bed has been established, this
   subsurface field laboratory will be used to assess fluid-rock
   interaction, sensor development and to support advanced reservoir
   modelling techniques relating to sustainable energy technologies
   including CCS.

   BGS hosts and develops the UK CO[2] Storage Evaluation Database in
   partnership with The Crown Estate. This database represents a state of
   the art assessment of storage potential of the offshore UK. Development
   of the database was funded by  the ETI and the Crown Estate.

   BGS is a core member of the BIGCCS Centre (Research Council of Norway
   and industry funding, 2009 – 2017). The goal of the Centre is to enable
   sustainable power generation from fossil fuels based on cost-effective
   CCS. The BIGCCS Centre develops new knowledge and technologies required
   to accelerate deployment of large scale CCS through international
   cooperation, innovation and value creation.

   BGS is responsible for development of the IEAGHG web-based storage site
   monitoring selection tool which identifies and prioritises technologies
   that could form part of a monitoring programme (funded by IEAGHG)

   BGS lead the DiSECCS project (EPSRC research grant, 2013 – 2017). This
   project brings together monitoring datasets from the World’s three
   industrial scale CO[2] storage sites at Sleipner, Snohvit and In Salah
   to develop and test advanced and innovative monitoring tools and
   methods for the measurement and characterisation of the CO[2] storage
   reservoirs through advanced seismic techniques.

   BGS is also partner in a new NERC-funded grant (2016-2020) to assess
   CO[2] migration processes in storage site overburdens; Characterization
   of major overburden leakage pathways above sub-seafloor CO[2] storage
   reservoirs in the North Sea (CHIMNEY).

   The ULTimateCO2 FP7 project (2011 – 2015) focused on the long-term
   processes involved in the geological storage of CO[2] in order to
   increase confidence in the long-term efficiency and safety of CCS. BGS
   was Work Package leader responsible for directing research on long-term
   geochemical reactions in reservoir systems following CO[2] injection.

   The QICS controlled subsea release project (funded by NERC and the
   Scottish Government, 2010 – 2014) improved understanding of the
   sensitivities of the UK marine environment to CO[2]. The aim of the
   project was to understand potential impacts if leakage were to occur
   from a CCS project. BGS was lead partner on drilling and CO[2]
   injection for the project.

   The CO[2]CARE project (funded through EC FP7 and industrial
   sponsorship, 2011 – 2014) delivered technology and procedures for
   abandonment and post-closure safety, satisfying the regulatory
   requirements for transfer of responsibility. BGS coordinated the
   development of dry-run site closure applications for the Sleipner,
   Ketzin and K12-B storage sites.

   The SiteChar FP 7Project (2011 – 2013) researched development of site
   characterisation methodologies to satisfy European regulations relating
   to CO[2] storage. BGS coordinated the assessment of dry-run storage
   licence applications for possible UK and Danish storage sites on behalf
   of representatives of industry, academia and regulatory bodies.

NIVA

Norwegian Institute for Water Research

   NIVA, the Norwegian Institute for Water Research, is the leading
   applied water research institute in Norway, covering both fresh water
   and sea water quality and flora/fauna. The institute is widely engaged
   in environmental and toxicological and assessments on contract from
   industry as well as governmental bodies.

   NIVA has large onshore facilities for messocosm studies as well as a
   ISO-certificated national laboratory for chemical water analyses. Its
   scientific staff of around 200 covers biological and environmental
   knowledge necessary for the assessments of marine impacts from CO2
   leaks. NIVA presently coordinates the Norwegian efforts in the
   international CTI project on ocean CO2 sequestration with emphasis on
   environmental impact from deep CO2 releases. This project has important
   international links and relations to the present proposed Norwegian
   program and mutual spin-off and information exchange will be essential.
   In additional, NIVA will from 2004 on join an international consortium
   to study methane hydrates on/under the seabed, and the impacts from
   possible exploitation of this significant gas resource. NIVA has been a
   partner to an international CTI project on ocean CO2 sequestration
   since 1997. From 2001 NIVA was the co-ordinator of this project, that
   is, for the experimental parts with release of liquid CO2 near the
   seabed to study environmental effects on and above the bottom. The
   experiment was brought to a halt in 2002 due to protests from some
   environmental groups (see NATURE, 5 Sept. 2001, p 6), but there are
   still plans to do this experiment, which would foster relevant spin-off
   to the new NoE as well. Of particular relevance may be the network and
   co-operation with US, Japanese, Norwegian and Canadian deepwater
   biologists, experts on CO2 plume modelling, and experts in various
   other fields related to carbon storage. NIVA is a partner to a project
   with Statoil Norway to study impacts from CO2 leaking from underground
   reservoirs. NIVA is attached to the work to produce a special report
   for the IPCC on Carbon Sequestration as decided at the last IPCC
   meeting in Paris (see NATURE, 27 February, p 879). In co-operation with
   the Norwegian Underwater Institute in Bergen we have been planning for
   long-time hyperbaric experiments in pressure chambers with CO2 and
   sediments. NIVA has a wide range of oceanographic equipment suitable
   for doing benthic layer measurements and taking samples, physical,
   biological and chemical.

PGI-NRI

Polish Geological Institute – National Research Institute

   The Polish Geological Institute – National Research Institute, founded
   in 1919, is the largest R&D institute in Polish geology.

   PGI-NRI coordinated the National Programme "Assessment of formations
   and structures suitable for safe CO2 geological storage including
   monitoring plans" (2008-2012/2013; Ministry of Environment) where over
   60 PGI employees have been involved in various tasks and other five
   Polish partners were involved (AGH, CMI, O&GI, MEERI PAS, PBG - in
   total about two hundred people). The programme was to provide
   information necessary for future permits on exploration of CO2 storage
   sites all over the country and characterize selected storage sites
   using archive data and laboratory analyzes on drill core samples.
   Another project (O&GI, PGI-NRI; Ministry of Environment) was devoted to
   techno-economic aspects of CO2-EOR and CO-EGR in Poland. PGI has
   provided expertise to the first Polish demo project Bełchatów (a dozen
   people involved in total) and other CCS projects which have been
   planned as well (e.g. the planned new CCS-ready power blocks), leading
   prefeasibility studies on CO2 storage and transport for power companies
   and elaborating relevant EEPR and NER300 applications (including the
   formerly planned CCS demo project of PKE&ZAK in Kędzierzyn). We have
   been involved in several studies on pilot CO2 injection (sandstone
   Jurassic aquifer), where for the final location (in central Poland) a
   research/injection permit was granted by Ministry of Environment and
   research infrastructure was planned to be constructed within PGI
   facility (wells, monitoring infrastructure) but now another initiative
   on pilot injection project located in the vicinity of TAURON pilot
   capture facilities in southern Poland is planned. Now, modelling and
   laboratory studies on CO2 injection into gas bearing shales (Norway
   grants) as well as paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic studies on
   correlation of regional caprock formations (Ministry of Science and
   Higher Education) are being conducted. FP7 projects: CGS Europe, ECCSEL

RBINS-GSB

Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences

   The Geological Survey of Belgium, department of the Royal Belgian
   Institute of Natural Sciences, is a geo-scientific documentation centre
   and is a central player in national and international research and
   development projects.

   Information and materials dealing with the subsoil can be consulted
   here. In order to do this, modern and historical data that become
   available through research and exploration, are digitally processed in
   databases and geographical information systems. On request, this
   information is processed into specific end-user products or advice.
   Various scientific disciplines are necessary to do this, e.g.
   cartography, sedimentology, mineralogy, stratigraphy, geophysics and
   building materials. As a part of our service providing mission, also
   basic social issues are dealt with, like how to use and process the
   subsoil in a sustainable way, and how to cope with problems caused by
   inappropriate use. Special attention goes to urban geology, water
   resources, climate change, mineral resources, environment and
   geo-hazards. Geology is a part of experiencing nature. That is why the
   development of geoparks and geosites is stimulated.

   The GeoEnergy group of the Geological Survey of Belgium originated with
   the exploration campaigns for coal in the Flanders and the Walloon
   region. The expertise was extended with projects including exploration
   for hydrocarbons, geothermal energy, heat-cold storage, subsoil
   gasification of coal, storage of natural gas and reutilising mining
   infrastructure. From 2000 on, research is performed on the
   possibilities of geological storage of CO2 for national and

Sapienza

SAPIENZA University of Rome

   Sapienza University of Rome is one of the founding members of
   CO2GeoNet, with a central role in the areas of gas migration mechanisms
   and communication of research outcomes.

   The Sapienza Universityis an internationally recognised centre of
   excellence for education and cutting edge research. It combines its
   700-year scientific tradition with a constant commitment to innovation
   and the spreading of knowledge. Eleven faculties coordinate over 65
   departments, 59 libraries and 21 museums, serving more than 115.000
   students.

   It is represented in the network by the Tectonic and Fluid Geochemistry
   Laboratory, based at the Earth Science Department and member of the
   CERI Research Centre for Geological Risks. The laboratory is
   specialised in near-surface gas and water geochemistry since 1980,
   social aspects of scientific research since 2000, and structural
   geology since 2006, with applications focussed on CCS research over the
   last 10 years. In the laboratory, researchers from the fields of
   geology, engineering and social science work together. The wide
   knowledge base and expertise within the group allows for an integrated
   scientific research approach, which comprises soil gas studies and
   structural geology studies, the engineering of innovative monitoring
   sensors and prototypes, and the development of tools and channels for
   the communication with stakeholders and the public.

   Research conducted in the Sapienza Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry Lab
   during more than 30 years of its existence, has addressed a wide range
   of topics related to, for example, natural hazards (faults,
   earthquakes, volcanoes), environmental impact (groundwater
   contamination), and resource exploration (oil and gas, geothermal,
   minerals), as well as studies examining the safety of storing nuclear
   waste or CO[2 ]gas in the deep geological sub-surface.

   Research Topics and Activities

   Natural Field Labs - The Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry Lab team has
   developed the concept of the natural field laboratory, as a main tool
   for developing research activities applied to geological storage.
   Natural field laboratories are sites where naturally produced CO[2] is
   leaking at the ground surface, both onshore and offshore. These sites
   can be properly equipped to allow researchers from different fields and
   countries work together in an open air laboratory.

   The studies in these natural conditions allow to:

   -       to better understand gas migration mechanisms in the geological
   environment (e.g. along faults and fracture networks);

   -       to test a wide range of monitoring techniques that have been
   proposed for use at CCS sites (e.g. soil gas, gas flux, open path
   lasers, remote sensing, shallow geophysics, etc.);

   -       to examine the possible impacts of a CO2 leak on the ecosystem
   and on groundwater quality.

   The most important natural field labs where the group has developed its
   activities are the Latera caldera (photo above), the San Vittorino
   valley, and Panarea Island.

   Near surface gas geochemistry:

   1)    discontinuous monitoring - The Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry
   Lab is one of the most experienced European research group in this
   field, having used soil gas geochemistry and gas flux methods since the
   early 1980’s as a tool for environmental, resource exploration and risk
   assessment studies.  A large database covering the whole National
   territory, with more than 40.000 gas samples, has been collected in the
   last 20 years.

   Much of the work has been focussed on using natural field laboratories
   to better understand gas migration processes, to improve methodologies
   and to test new ones, as laser systems for atmospheric monitoring and
   gas sensing probes for continuous monitoring. This group has also
   conducted extensive research on CCS industrial sites such as In Salah
   (Algeria), Sulcis (Sardinia), and 5 years of monitoring at Weyburn
   (Canada).

   Areas sampled by the Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry Lab during the
   last 20 years

   A particular scenario for gas monitoring are populated areas with
   natural release of CO2 and other gases of deep origin like Radon, such
   as the city of Ciampino on the southern edge of Rome and the Latera
   caldera. In these areas soil gas and aqueous geochemical surveys were
   performed, as well as gas measurements in private homes. GIS models
   were developed, indicating zones of elevated risk, and activities with
   the general public to improve local understanding and safety. These
   activities are still ongoing, and new sampling strategies are
   developing, with the aims to combine continuous and discontinuous
   monitoring, to cover the spatial and temporal scale of observation.
   Moreover, research focus at the moment is on baseline studies and how a
   potential leakage anomaly can be separated from background near-surface
   biological “noise”, as well as improved monitoring strategies, tool
   development, and data interpretation.

   2)    Continuous monitoring: CO[2]GasPro monitoring station.

   The team of the Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry Lab has developed,
   constructed, and deployed a number of autonomous stations for the
   continuous monitoring of both CO2 and CH4 concentrations in air (that
   is, in the unsaturated soil horizon or on ground surface) and CO2
   concentration in water (in groundwater wells or in surface water
   bodies). The system can be configured for either real-time data access
   via an Internet-based server or with an internal memory for
   intermittent data download where continual data transfer is difficult
   (e.g. the deep ocean).

   Groundwater and surface water geochemistry.

   The Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry Lab has over 30 years of
   experience in aqueous geochemistry studies as applied to a wide variety
   of geological studies, and has laboratory capability for the analysis
   of major and trace elements and dissolved gases. Studies related to CCS
   include: examining the impact of natural CO2 seepage on the quality of
   shallow groundwater within the San Vittorino valley and of surface
   seawater near Panarea Island; studying dissolved gas distributions and
   processes in surface water at gas-leaking natural sites (Panarea
   Island, Black Sea) and at proposed industrial storage sites (Adriatic
   Sea); and testing long-term monitoring methods for groundwater tracers
   in shallow wells as related to seismic activity and sinkhole
   development within the city of Camaiore.

   Fracture modelling and fault characterization

   From 2006 the Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry Lab team includes the
   contribution of structural geologists. This has allowed the group to
   enrich its research, integrating the study of soil gas migration with
   fracture modelling, fault zone characterization, geological modelling
   and seismic interpretation. All these aspects cover a fundamental role
   in the site characterization phase of geological storage. In
   particular, the occurrence of faults in the overburden and within the
   reservoir requires dedicated studies to support the development of
   appropriate risk assessment and monitoring strategies. Research is
   being developed to coupled fault zone geometry and potential leakage.
   The group is also engaged in fracture modelling, which is an important
   step to assess the capacity of a potential CO2 storage reservoir, using
   a field analogue approach, developed in collaboration with
   Schlumberger.

   Study of CO2 storage perception and communication.

   Since the year 2000 the Tectonics and Fluid Geochemistry Lab has
   started to explore the challenges of geological studies’ dissemination.
   Psychological studies have been undertaken to understand how to
   communicate the research outcomes to stakeholders and the public. In
   the context of CO[2]GeoNet the group has become a leader for Spreading
   of Excellence activities, coordinating the partners and promoting the
   integration of multidisciplinary research in the field of CO[2] storage
   and its user friendly communication. Growingly has emerged the
   importance of interaction of the researchers with the wider societal
   context, to better address in their work what is of interest and
   concern to society. This has led the members of the lab to further
   develop tools for communicating science, as for instance lay reports
   and videos, and research experiences of direct sharing with
   stakeholders, the media and the public, as in the FP7 R&Dialogue
   project. A new phase of this work is going to take place in the context
   of the Horizon 2020 project ENOS. Research will be dedicated to explore
   how the collaboration of researchers with members of the public and of
   the local community, can help the development of satisfactory standards
   for all, in the best practice guidelines for the geological storage of
   CO[2].

A multiscale multilayer vertically integrated model with vertical dynamics
for CO2 sequestration in layered geological formations

   Guo B, Bandilla K W, Nordbotten Jan M, Celia Michael A, Keilegavlen E,
   Doster F
   Efficient computational models are desirable for simulation of
   large-scale geological CO2 sequestration. Vertically integrated models,
   which take advantage of dimension reduction, offer one type of
   computationally efficient model. The dimension reduction is usually
   achieved by vertical integration based on the vertical equilibrium (VE)
   assumption, which assumes that CO2 and brine segregate rapidly in the
   vertical due to strong buoyancy and quickly reach pressure equilibrium.
   However, the validity of the VE assumption requires small time scales
   of fluid segregation, which may not always be fulfilled, especially for
   heterogeneous geological formations with low vertical permeability.
   Recently, Guo et al. (2014a) developed a multiscale vertically
   integrated model, referred to as the dynamic reconstruction (DR) model,
   that relaxes the VE assumption by including the vertical two-phase flow
   dynamics of CO2 and brine as fine-scale one-dimensional problems in the
   vertical direction. Although the VE assumption can be relaxed, that
   model was limited to homogeneous geological formations. Here we extend
   the dynamic reconstruction model for layered heterogeneous formations,
   which is of much more practical interest for saline aquifers in
   sedimentary basins. We develop a new coarse-scale pressure equation to
   couple the different coarse-scale (vertically integrated) layers, and
   use the fine-scale dynamic reconstruction algorithm in Guo et al.
   (2014a) within each individual layer. Together, these form a multiscale
   multilayer dynamic reconstruction algorithm. Simulation results of the
   CO2 plume from the new model are in excellent agreement with full
   three-dimensional models, with the new algorithm being much more
   computationally efficient than conventional full three-dimensional
   models. © 2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

Acid-dissolution of antigorite, chrysotile and lizardite for ex situ carbon
capture and storage by mineralisation

   Lacinska A M, Styles M T, Bateman Keith, Wagner D, Hall M R, Gowing C,
   Brown P D
   Serpentine minerals serve as a Mg donor in carbon capture and storage
   by mineralisation (CCSM). The acid-treatment of nine
   comprehensively-examined serpentine polymorphs and polytypes, and the
   subsequent microanalysis of their post-test residues highlighted
   several aspects of great importance to the choice of the optimal feed
   material for CCSM. Compelling evidence for the non-uniformity of
   serpentine mineral performance was revealed, and the following order of
   increasing Mg extraction efficiency after three hours of acid-leaching
   was established: Al-bearing polygonal serpentine (<5%) ≤ Al-bearing
   lizardite 1T (≈5%) < antigorite (24-29%) < well-ordered lizardite 2H1
   (≈65%) ≤ Al-poor lizardite 1T (≈68%) < chrysotile (≈70%) <
   poorly-ordered lizardite 2H1 (≈80%) < nanotubular chrysotile (≈85%).It
   was recognised that the Mg extraction efficiency of the minerals
   depended greatly on the intrinsic properties of crystal structure,
   chemistry and rock microtexture. On this basis, antigorite and
   Al-bearing well-ordered lizardite were rejected as potential feedstock
   material whereas any chrysotile, non-aluminous, widely spaced lizardite
   and/or disordered serpentine were recommended.The formation of
   peripheral siliceous layers, tens of microns thick, was not universal
   and depended greatly upon the intrinsic microtexture of the leached
   particles. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of
   nine, carefully-selected serpentine minerals, covering most varieties
   and polytypes, under the same experimental conditions. We focused on
   material characterization and the identification of the intrinsic
   properties of the minerals that affect particle's reactivity. It can
   therefore serve as a generic basis for any acid-based CCSM
   pre-treatment. © 2016 The Authors.

An engineering solution for CO2 injection in saline aquifers

   Shariatipour S M, Mackay E J, Pickup Gillian E
   In this proposed CO2 injection system, brine is extracted from the
   target storage aquifer by means of a lateral horizontal completion
   located near the top of the formation. It should be noted that the
   brine is not lifted to the surface. An Electrical Submersible Pump
   (ESP) is used to extract the brine and boost its pressure, before it is
   mixed with CO2 that is injected down the vertical section of the well.
   The mixing takes place in the vertical section of the well below the
   upper lateral. The CO2–brine mix is then injected into the same
   formation through a lower lateral. A down-hole tool would be used to
   maximise agitation and contact area between CO2 and brine in the
   vertical mixing section of the well, which may be tens to hundreds of
   metres long, depending on the thickness of the formation. The
   advantages of this method are that there is little overall pressure
   increase, because CO2 is mixed with brine extracted from the formation,
   and also the extracted brine is already at high pressure when it is
   mixed with the CO2, greatly increasing the solubility of CO2 and
   reducing the volume of brine required. Energy is not expended lifting
   the brine to surface nor is there any concern about handling large
   volumes of acidic brine in the surface equipment. In this study, in
   addition to the concept of the down-hole mixing (DHM) method which is
   presented, the application of the DHM method in a hypothetical storage
   site (Lincolnshire—Smith et al., 2012) is also examined. The
   calculations are performed to identify the optimum rates of water
   extraction and injection of dissolved CO2 in brine. © 2016

An experimental study of the potential for fault reactivation during changes
in gas and pore-water pressure

   Cuss R J, Harrington J F
   The injection of CO2 into a depleted reservoir will alter the pore
   pressure, which if sufficiently perturbed could result in fault
   reactivation. This paper presents an experimental study of fault
   reactivation potential in fully saturated kaolinite and Ball Clay fault
   gouges. Clear differences were observed in fault reactivation pressure
   when water was injected, with the addition of mica/illite in Ball Clay
   seen to reduce the pressure necessary for reactivation. Slip occurred
   once pore-pressure within the gouge was sufficient to overcome the
   normal stress acting on the fault. During gas injection localised
   dilatant pathways are formed with approximately only 15% of the fault
   observing an elevated gas pressure. This localisation is insufficient
   to overcome normal stress and so reactivation is not initiated.
   Therefore faults are more likely to conduct gas than to reactivate. The
   Mohr approach of assessing fault reactivity potential gave mixed
   results. Hydro-mechanical coupling, saturation state, mineralogical
   composition and time-dependent features of the clay require inclusion
   in this approach otherwise experiments that are predicted to be stable
   result in fault reactivation. © 2016
