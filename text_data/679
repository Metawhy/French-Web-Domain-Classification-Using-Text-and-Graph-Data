Welcome to the Apache MyFaces Project

   Apache MyFaces is a project of the Apache Software Foundation, and
   hosts several sub-projects relating to the JavaServer™ technology. If
   you want to know more about how JavaServer™ Faces works, take a look at
   the MyFaces introduction to JSF

   The Apache MyFaces project provides:
     * a JavaServer™ Faces implementation (MyFaces Core, providing
       api/impl and bundle modules)
     * a component library MyFaces Tobago containing UI widgets for
       building web-applications with JSF

   Notes

   MyFaces Core and MyFaces Tobago are under active development. The
   libaries MyFaces Tomahawk, MyFaces Trinidad, MyFaces Orchestra, MyFaces
   Extensions Validator, MyFaces Extensions CDI and MyFaces Portlet Bridge
   are in maintenance mode. We are still accepting patches and with
   support of the community we will prepare releases.

   Quickstart
     * Find instructions on installing them yourselves in our Quick Start
       section. For additional information, you can refer to our
       confluence WIKI or our public WIKI.
