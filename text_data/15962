How Beyonce (Probably) Reacted to Maya Rudolph Singing National Anthem in
Graduation Speech (VIDEO)

   Saturday Night Live alum Maya Rudolph gave the commencement speech to
   the graduating class of 2015 at Tulane University over the weekend, and
   the funny lady took on one of her signature characters to give the
   crowd a treat. At the end of her speech, she channeled Beyonce to sing
   a warbley and drawn-out version of the "Star Spangled Banner," complete
   with some of Bey's own lyrics.

   The comedienne performed the national anthem, but about halfway through
   switched over into singing lines from "Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"
   "Single Ladies," and "Drunk in Love."

   Take a look:

   Oh course it's hilarious, and she's obviously a talented singer in her
   own right to not only be able to mimic Jay Z's wife, but exaggerate her
   vocals as well. But the really important question is -- how did Beyonce
   react when she heard this?

   Because How Dare She Not Look 'Flawless'

   While Queen Bey has yet to make a statement about Rudolf's rendition of
   her rendition of the national anthem, we can always imagine what went
   through her mind.

   Her first thought was probably something along the lines of, "Really?
   Are you kidding me with this? Whatevs."

   Seriously, she doesn't even have time for this.

   What is Maya doing to the national anthem? Bey can't believe anyone
   thinks she sings like that! Why are they all knowingly laughing?

   Then she probably realized she does do some incredible vocal
   acrobatics, and Maya was just having fun with her style.

   But she owns it, and appreciates the fact that her voice is so
   recognizable, people recognize it in exaggerated comedy sketches of it.
   Bless it.

   Do you think Beyonce liked Maya Rudolf's Tulane speech?
