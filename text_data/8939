   This article was first published in November 2014; last revised in
   April 2018.

   HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a lentivirus which can lead to
   acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS in humans results in a
   gradual and persistent decline and failure of the immune system,
   resulting in heightened risk of life-threatening infection and cancers.

   In the majority of cases, HIV is a sexually-transmitted infection.
   However, HIV can also be transmitted from a mother to her child, during
   pregnancy or childbirth (through blood or fluid exposure), or through
   breastfeeding. Non-sexual transmission can also occur through the
   sharing of injection equipment such as needles.

   This entry presents a global overview the HIV and AIDS epidemics,
   presenting data on prevalence, deaths, transmission, treatment and
   connected impacts on life expectancy, discrimination and education.

Empirical View

   The 1990s saw a substantial increase in the number of people infected
   with HIV and the number of people dying of AIDS as the chart below
   shows. In 1997, almost 3.5 million people were diagnosed with HIV per
   year. After 1997, the number of new cases began to decline and by 2017
   it was reduced to less than 2 million per year.

   The number of AIDS-related deaths increased throughout the 1990s and
   reached a peak in 2005, 2006 when in both years 1.95 million people
   died. Since then the annual number of deaths from AIDS declined as well
   and almost halved within a decade. By 2017 the number of deaths has
   fallen to less than 1 million annual deaths.

   The chart also shows the continuing increase in the number of people
   living with HIV. The rate of increase has slowed down compared to the
   1990s but the absolute number is growing steadily and close to 37
   million people were living with HIV globally.

People with HIV/AIDS

Prevalence of HIV/AIDS

   In the chart below you can see how adult HIV prevalence has changed
   with time, by clicking the play button on the bottom left. Data from
   both the UNAIDS/World Bank and IHME, Global Burden of Disease are shown
   in the two charts below.

   Overall, prevalence increased until the mid 2000s, where it peaked
   globally and has since declined. Southern Africa remains the world
   region with the highest prevalence. In 2017 Botswana had the highest
   prevalence: 22.8 percent of 15-49 year olds had HIV.

Number of people with HIV

   In the charts below we see the number of people with HIV by region and
   by country. In 2017 more than 36 million had HIV globally; 71 percent
   were in Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of the absolute number of people
   with HIV, South Africa had the greatest number in 2017 with almost 6.6
   million.

New Infections

Number of new infections per year

   There are two vital components to addressing the global HIV epidemic:
   treatment of those with HIV and the prevention of further transmission.
   The charts below show the number of new HIV infections of HIV per year.

   As shown, the total number of new infections per year peaked globally
   in 1995 at 3.4 million and has since declined to 1.8 million.

HIV incidence

   0.04% of the world population are currently (2017 data) newly infected
   with HIV every year. This incidence of HIV was halved from 0.1% in the
   mid 1990s.

   The distribution of these new cases is not even across different
   regions. While in Asian and Latin American countries the incidence is
   well below 0.1% there are some countries with much higher incidence. In
   South Africa 0.96% of the previously uninfected population was infected
   with HIV in 2017.

   Fortunately, the number of new cases in Sub-Sarharan Africa and other
   world regions has now been steadily decreasing each year.

Deaths from AIDS

HIV/AIDS deaths by age group

   The visualisation below shows the annual number of deaths from
   HIV/AIDS, differentiated by age group. Note that this data can be
   viewed for any country in the interactive chart features below.

   Globally we see a clear rise-peak-decline trend in HIV-related deaths.
   In 1990, the total number of deaths is estimated to be approximately
   349,000; this increased to peak in 2005/06 at approximately 1.95
   million. Since then, the total number of deaths has almost halved,
   falling to less than 1 million in 2017.

   Across this period, 15-49 year olds have maintained the highest (and a
   consistent) share of around 66-72 percent of global deaths from
   HIV/AIDS.

HIV and children

Children living with HIV

   In children with HIV, transmission has typically occurred from the
   mother (mother-to-child-transmission; MTCT) either during pregnancy or
   childbirth, or through breastfeeding. The charts below shows the total
   number of children aged 14 years old and under who are living with HIV.
   Globally the number of children living with HIV peaked in 2005 at
   approximately 2.1 million. This has since declined to 1.8 million in
   2017.

New HIV infections of children

   The visualisation below shows the total number of children newly
   infected with HIV each year. Globally — with similar trends at national
   levels — the number of new infections in children peaked around the
   early 2000s (globally at 420,000 new infections per year) followed by a
   rapid decline over the last decade. In 2017 an estimated 180,000 new
   children were infected with HIV.

Orphaned children from AIDS

   ‘Orphaned’ children are defined as those who have lost either one or
   both parents from AIDS. This does not necessarily imply that children
   orphaned by AIDS have HIV themselves (although in some cases HIV has
   been transmitted from mother-to-child). The chart below shows the
   number of children (aged 17 and under) orphaned from AIDS deaths.

HIV, AIDS and gender

   There are differences in both the prevalence of HIV and death rates
   from AIDS between men and women. The charts below show both the
   differences in prevalence between males and females, and the
   differences in AIDS-deaths.

   As seen, HIV prevalence tends to be higher in women across Sub-Saharan
   Africa, although higher in males across most other regions. The trend
   in AIDS-related deaths shows the opposite: more men tend to to die from
   AIDS every year than women. The reasons for differences in prevalence
   and death rates are complex; however, in general, across Sub-Saharan
   Africa women tend to be infected with HIV earlier than men and survive
   longer (explaining both the higher prevalence and lower annual AIDS
   deaths in women). There are a number of gender inequality and social
   norm issues which result in higher prevalence of HIV in females across
   many countries; women are at greater risk when they have a limited role
   in sexual decision-making and protection, role rates of sexual
   education and higher rates of transactional sex^1.

Correlates, Determinants, & Consequences

Antiretroviral Medicine & Treatment

   Reducing the impact of the HIV epidemic requires the prevention of
   further transmission, as well as treatment for those already living
   with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly active in suppressing
   viral replication, reducing the amount of the virus in the blood to
   undetectable levels and slowing the progress of HIV disease.

   The charts below show the number of people receiving antiretroviral
   therapy (ART), the coverage of pregnant women receiving ART for the
   prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and the gap in
   coverage for those living with HIV.

Deaths averted from antiretroviral therapy (ART)

   Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been critical in reducing the number
   of deaths from AIDS. In the chart below we see the number of deaths
   from AIDS, as well as the number of deaths averted as a result of ART.
   Globally, 1.2 million deaths in 2016 were averted as a result of ART –
   this is greater than the 1 million deaths which occurred. Without ART,
   global deaths from AIDS would be more than double their current annual
   figures.

   In South Africa, ART has been crucial in reducing death rates from
   AIDS. Approximately three-quarters of potential deaths from AIDS were
   averted in 2016 as a result of ART.

Deaths averted from HIV programmes

   Deaths averted from AIDS can result from both treatment (ART) and
   prevention of HIV transmission. The chart below shows recent data of
   the estimated number of deaths averted as a result of all HIV
   programmes, which includes treatment and prevention of transmission
   such as through education & contraceptive programmes.

HIV Transmission Prevention

   The majority of HIV infections are transmitted through sexual activity.
   Sexual transmission can be prevented through condom use (both in
   heterosexual and homosexual relationships). In the charts below we see
   the prevalence of condom use, particularly in cases of ‘high-risk sex’,
   which is that with a non-marital, non-cohabiting sexual partner.

HIV impacts on life expectancy

   The following chart shows that while globally life expectancy has been
   increasing since the 1950s, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa saw
   a major decrease in life expectancy with the onset of the AIDS crisis
   around 1990. Life expectancy has started to increase again since the
   early 2000s, but for many of the countries shown, levels have not yet
   returned to life expectancies prior to the AIDS crisis.

Tuberculosis among People Living with HIV

   Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading HIV-associated opportunistic infection
   in low- and middle- income countries, and it is a leading cause of
   death globally among people living with HIV. Death due to tuberculosis
   still remains high among people living with HIV, however the number of
   deaths is decreasing. Most of the global mortality due to TB among
   those with HIV is from cases in Sub-Saharan Africa.

   In the charts below we see the number of tuberculosis (TB) patients who
   tested positive for HIV; the number receiving antiretroviral therapy
   (ART); and the number of TB-related deaths among those living with HIV.

Resources Available to Spend on HIV/AIDS

   The following chart shows international and domestic spending on HIV,
   broken down by donor, and region in low- and middle-income countries.
   Globally investment in HIV treatment and prevention was approximately
   US$19 billion. Also shown is the estimated funding requirements through
   to 2030; it’s expected that approximately US$25-26 billion per year
   will be required to meet future requirements of treatment and
   prevention programmes.

   Previously, we have seen that AIDs deaths are still steadily increasing
   in the Middle East and North Africa, which may partially be due to the
   lack of domestic resources placed on ART therapy in this region.

Discriminatory attitudes to those with HIV

   Discrimination towards those living with HIV remains common in many
   countries. High-coverage data on discrimination is scarce, however in
   the charts below we see the share of the population with discriminatory
   attitudes across a number of countries. This was assessed by the use of
   surveys which asked the question: “Would you buy fresh vegetables from
   a shopkeeper or vendor if you knew that this person had HIV?”. The
   presented figures show the share of respondents (who had previously
   heard of HIV) who said they would not buy from a vendor with HIV.

   In a number of countries more than half of respondents showed
   discriminatory attitudes. In Guinea, this share was as high as 80
   percent.

Data Quality & Definition

Terminology and Definitions

   The following terminology and definitions are sourced from the UNAIDS
   organization.^2

   HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus. HIV is a virus that weakens the
   immune system, ultimately leading to AIDS.

   AIDS: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

   Antiretroviral medicines/ Antiretrovirals (ARVs)/ Antiretroviral
   therapy (ART)/ HIV treatment: “Antiretroviral therapy is highly active
   in suppressing viral replication, reducing the amount of the virus in
   the blood to undetectable levels and slowing the progress of HIV
   disease. The usual antiretroviral therapy regimen combines three or
   more different medicines, such as two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
   inhibitors (NRTI) and a protease inhibitor, two nucleoside analogue
   reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a non-nucleoside reverse
   transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or other combinations.

   More recently, entry inhibitors and integrase inhibitors have joined
   the range of treatment options. Suboptimal regimens are monotherapy and
   dual therapy. The term highly active antiretroviral therapy was
   commonly used after the demonstration of excellent virological and
   clinical response to combinations of three (or more) antiretroviral
   medicines. Highly active is not needed as a qualification, however, and
   the term is no longer commonly used.

   ARV refers to antiretroviral medicines. It should only be used when
   referring to the medicines themselves and not to their use.”

   ARV-based prevention: “ARV-based prevention includes the oral or
   topical use of antiretroviral medicines to prevent the acquisition of
   HIV in HIV-negative persons (such as the use of pre-exposure
   prophylaxis or post-exposure prophylaxis) or to reduce the transmission
   of HIV from people living with HIV (treatment as prevention).”

   Epidemic: “An epidemic refers to a disease condition affecting (or
   tending to affect) a disproportionately large number of individuals
   within a population, community or region at the same time. The
   population may be all of the inhabitants of a given geographic area,
   the population of a school or similar institution or everyone of a
   certain age or sex (such as the children or women of a region). An
   epidemic may be restricted to one locale (an outbreak), be more general
   (an epidemic) or be global (a pandemic). Common diseases that occur at
   a constant but relatively high rate in the population are said to be
   endemic.”

   HIV-negative (seronegative): “A person who is HIV-negative (also known
   as seronegative) shows no evidence of HIV in a blood test (e.g. there
   is an absence of antibodies against HIV). The test result of a person
   who has acquired HIV but is in the window period between HIV exposure
   and detection of antibodies also will be negative.”

   HIV-positive (seropositive): “A person who is HIV-positive (or
   seropositive) has had antibodies against HIV detected in a blood test
   or gingival exudate test (commonly known as a saliva test). Results may
   occasionally be false-positive, especially in infants up to 18 months
   of age who are carrying maternal antibodies.”

   Incidence: “HIV incidence is expressed as the number of new HIV
   infections over the number of people susceptible to infection in a
   specified time period. Cumulative incidence may be expressed as the
   number of new cases arising in a given period in a specified
   population. UNAIDS reports the estimated number of incident cases that
   occurred in the past year among people aged 15–49 years and 0–14
   years.”

   Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT): “MTCT is the abbreviation for
   mother-to-child transmission. PMTCT, the abbreviation for prevention of
   mother-to-child transmission, refers to a four-prong strategy for
   stopping new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers
   alive and families healthy. The four prongs are: helping
   reproductive-age women avoid HIV (prong 1); reducing unmet need for
   family planning (prong 2); providing antiretroviral medicine
   prophylaxis to prevent HIV transmission during pregnancy, labour and
   delivery, and breastfeeding (prong 3); and providing care, treatment
   and support for mothers and their families (prong 4).

   PMTCT often is mistakenly used to refer to only prong 3— the provision
   of antiretroviral medicine prophylaxis. Some countries prefer to use
   the terms parent-to-child transmission or vertical transmission as more
   inclusive terms to avoid stigmatizing pregnant women, to acknowledge
   the role of the father/male sexual partner in transmitting HIV to the
   woman and to encourage male involvement in HIV prevention. Still other
   countries and organizations use the term elimination of mother-to-child
   transmission (eMTCT).”

   Prevalence: “Usually given as a percentage, HIV prevalence quantifies
   the proportion of individuals in a population who are living with HIV
   at a specific point in time. HIV prevalence also can refer to the
   number of people living with HIV. UNAIDS normally reports HIV
   prevalence among people aged 15–49 years.”

   Tuberculosis (TB): “Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading HIV-associated
   opportunistic infection in low- and middle- income countries, and it is
   a leading cause of death globally among people living with HIV. The
   term HIV-associated tuberculosis or HIV-associated TB should be used,
   rather than the shorthand HIV/TB, in order to distinguish such
   instances from tuberculosis per se.

   The main strategies to reduce the burden of HIV in TB patients are HIV
   testing (for people whose HIV status is unknown) and the provision of
   antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) (for
   people living with HIV). The main activities to reduce TB among people
   living with HIV are regular screening for TB among people in HIV care
   and the provision of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) and ART to
   HIV-positive people without active TB who meet eligibility criteria.”

Comparisons of UNAIDS and IHME estimates

   A number of sources publish estimates on HIV and AIDS – two of the most
   established (which are presented in this entry) are UNAIDS and the
   Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of
   Disease. In the charts below we show the relationship/consistency in
   estimates of prevalence between these two sources.

Notice: This is only a preliminary collection of relevant material

   Below you find some relevant material, but it is only a preliminary
   collection and we will further develop our work on this topic in the
   future (to cover it in the same detail as for example our entry on
   World Population Growth).

   If you have expertise in this area and would like to contribute, apply
   here to join us as a researcher.

   This article deals with intentional homicides which are defined as “an
   unlawful death deliberately inflicted on one person by another
   person”.^1 The data are presented as the homicide rate expressed as
   homicides per 100,000 inhabitants of a country or region.
   Homicides refer to interpersonal violence. Civilian and military deaths
   during interstate wars, civil wars and genocides are not counted as
   homicides – but Our World in Data presents the evidence on deaths in
   the linked articles.

Empirical View

Europe

   Eisner (2003) describes the secular trend of homicide rates in Europe
   and has collected data for this research paper. From his database
   Eisner constructed data for several European regions and presented this
   in a table. Using estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and
   Evaluation (IHME), we have extended this dataset through to 2016.
   European homicide rates have dramatically decreased over the last
   millennium and have remained steadily low over the past 50 years. Italy
   has historically had higher homicide rates than other European
   countries, but today those rates have reached Northern European levels.

   The long-term raw data without distinguishing between different states
   is visualized in the following graph.
   Note: This graph is Figure 2 in Eisner (2003) – Long-Term Historical
   Trends in Violent Crime. In Crime and Justice, 30, 83–142. It shows 398
   local estimates from Eisner’s Database and for the recent past it
   additionally includes the national series for Sweden, England and
   Wales, Switzerland, and Italy.

   -Eisner-2003.png

   The declining homicides in some regions and stagnating high homicides
   in other regions caused a huge inequality in violence in the 19th
   century as can be seen in the following map. Over the course of the
   last century this picture has changed: the south of Europe has followed
   northwestern Europe and now has similarly low violence. The remaining
   inequality is now between a more violent Eastern Europe and a less
   violent Western Europe.

Germany

   Since 1995 (the end of the observation period of Clark and Wildner
   (2000)) homicide rates dropped significantly.^6

   In the last year of the study of Clark and Wildner – the year 1995 –
   there were 1.207 homicides in Germany. Over the following years the
   number dropped and reached 723 homicides in 2011. The number of
   homicides in which a gun was involved dropped from 226 (in 1995) to 78
   (in 2011).

Global long run perspective

   The interactive chart below allows to visualise the long-term trend of
   homicides for countries around the world. Time coverage varies between
   countries – for some countries data is available going back to 1800
   while for other countries data for only 1 or 2 years are available.

Japan

   Homicide rates in Japan have steadily decreased over the past century.
   It’s interesting to note in the following graph that the homicide rate
   dropped significantly during and immediately after World War II,
   perhaps because the nation was focused on the war effort.

USA

   The homicide rate in the US has fallen dramatically over the past few
   centuries. The following graph shows the fall in the homicide rate in
   relation to various armed conflicts in New England. In the early
   colonial days in America, the homicide rate was incredibly high. But as
   the colonies became more established and orderly, the rate fell, except
   for the time during the American Revolution when the colonies were
   understandably amidst upheaval. It’s important to note that one cannot
   directly derive from this graph a causal relationship between these
   conflicts and the homicide rate.

   Pinker (2011) put together many quantitative accounts of the change and
   distribution of violent crime in the US. Below, we can see the
   disparity in homicide rates between various areas in present day New
   England. Predictably, the more urban areas of new York, Boston and
   Philadelphia have in general had higher homicide rates than the less
   dense states of Vermont and New Hampshire.

   Homicide rates in the US have declined dramatically over history, but
   they still remain much higher than other industrialized states. Below,
   we can see that in the 1960s and 1970s, the US, Canada and England all
   experienced increases in violent crime, but the increase in the US was
   much more dramatic than in the other two nations. These rates have
   since fallen in the US, but homicide is still much more common there
   than in Canada and England.

   pg

   The violent crime in the US is not shared equally among all the states;
   in general the more populous states tend to have much higher homicide
   rates.

   After a period of higher violence in the 1970s and 1980s the US
   experiences a marked decrease in homicides and other crime rates.
   Recent data is published in the US census here. From this data it can
   be seen that the downward trend continued in the recent economic
   crisis.

Correlates, Determinants & Consequences

   Kellermann and Mercy (1992)^15 studied 215,273 homicides in the United
   States between 1976 and 1987. In line with the results presented above
   only 14.7% of the homicides were commited by women. Similarly unequal
   was the distribution of gender among the victims. The study found that
   77% of the 215.273 victims were men.
   The UNODC Homicide statistic 2012 has global data on the gender of the
   sex of homicide victims.
   The table below shows the percentage of female offenders for various
   regions throughout history.

studies – Eisner (2003)^16

Data Quality & Definition

   There are two very different sources for historical data on homicide
   rates depending on the era discussed. For the last few decades,
   statistical offices have recorded homicide rates as part of the vital
   statistics. Eisner (2003) notes that “in most European countries, data
   series start during the second half of the nineteenth century, although
   Swedish national death statistics were introduced in the middle of the
   eighteenth century”.

   For earlier historical periods, researchers have reconstructed the
   long-term changes in homicide rates from historical records that often
   originated from some form of legal documentation of the crimes.
   Although there are gaps in the reconstructed data, and there are
   uncertainties in both the number of homicides and the size of the
   population, the historical record is more complete than one might
   assume. One reason for this is the great social importance of these
   crimes. Violent killings were of concern for a long time, and they were
   therefore often reliably registered. In some cases, or for prehistoric
   times, it is additionally possible to use the insights from forensic
   archaeologists, who can determine the causes of death from skeletal
   remains.
   Usually homicide rates are calculated as homicides per 100,000 people
   per year.

Data Sources

Historical sources

   The ‘Historical Violence Database’ Data on violence from medieval times
   to the present, mainly in Western Europe and the US, has been collected
   in the ‘Historical Violence Database’ at the Ohio State University. In
   addition to homicide rates for many countries this database also
   includes qualitative information – among much more inforamtion also on
   the place and the cause of death and on the victim and the perpetrator.
   The website can be found here: Historical Violence Database at Ohio
   State University

Introduction

Overview of this entry

   This entry is concerned with extreme poverty. The World Bank is the
   main source for global information on extreme poverty today and it sets
   the ‘International Poverty Line’. The poverty line was revised in
   2015—since then, a person is considered to be in extreme poverty if
   they live on less than 1.90 international dollars (int.-$) per day.
   This poverty measurement is based on the monetary value of a person’s
   consumption. Income measures, on the other hand, are only used for
   countries in which reliable consumption measures are not available.

   A key difficulty in measuring global poverty is that price levels are
   very different in different countries. For this reason, it is not
   sufficient to simply convert the consumption levels of people in
   different countries by the market exchange rate; it is additionally
   necessary to adjust for cross-country differences in purchasing power.
   This is done through Purchasing Power Parity adjustments (explained
   below).

   It is important to emphasize that the International Poverty Line is
   extremely low. Indeed, ‘extreme poverty’ is an adequate term for those
   living under this low threshold. Focusing on extreme poverty is
   important precisely because it captures those most in need. However, it
   is also important to point out that living conditions well above the
   International Poverty Line can still be characterized by poverty and
   hardship. Accordingly, in this entry we will also discuss the global
   distribution of people below poverty lines that are higher than the
   International Poverty Line of 1.90 int.-$. But relying only on higher
   poverty lines would mean that we are not keeping track of the very
   poorest people in the world and this is the focus of this entry.

   Poverty is a concept intrinsically linked to welfare – and there are
   many ways in which one can try to measure welfare. In this entry we
   will focus mainly (though not exclusively) on poverty as measured by
   ‘monetized’ consumption and income, following the approach used by the
   World Bank. But before we present the evidence, the introductory
   sub-section here provides a brief overview of the relevance of this
   approach.

   The available long-run evidence shows that in the past, only a small
   elite enjoyed living conditions that would not be described as ‘extreme
   poverty’ today. But with the onset of industrialization and rising
   productivity, the share of people living in extreme poverty started to
   decrease. Accordingly, the share of people in extreme poverty has
   decreased continuously over the course of the last two centuries. This
   is surely one of the most remarkable achievements of humankind.

   Closely linked to this improvement in material living conditions is the
   improvement of global health and the expansion of global education that
   we have seen over these last two centuries. We also discuss the link
   between education, health, and poverty in this entry.

   During the first half of the last century, the growth of the world
   population caused the absolute number of extremely poor people in the
   world to increase, even though the share of people in extreme poverty
   was going down. After around 1970, the decrease in poverty rates became
   so steep that the absolute number of people living in extreme
   poverty started falling as well. This trend of decreasing poverty—both
   in absolute numbers and as a share of the world population—has been a
   constant during the last three decades. But as we highlight in the
   first section of this entry it is unfortunately not what we can expect
   for the coming decade. It is the fact that still almost every tenth
   person lives in extreme poverty and the slowing progress against
   extreme poverty that motivate this entry.

Is the world on track to end extreme poverty by 2030?

   Growth of the global middle class and falling extreme poverty

   Over the course of the last generation more than a billion people left
   the most destitute living conditions behind. Can we expect this
   progress to continue over the coming decade?

   The world economy is growing. In less than a generation the value of
   the yearly global economic production has doubled.^1

   Increasing productivity around the world meant that many left the worst
   poverty behind. More than a third of the world population now live on
   more than 10 dollars per day. Just a decade decade ago it was only a
   quarter. In absolute numbers this meant the number of people who live
   on more than 10 dollars per day increased by 900 million in just the
   last 10 years.^2

   This expansion of the global middle class went together with progress
   in reducing global poverty – no matter what poverty line you want to
   compare it with, the share of the world population below this poverty
   line declined.^3 In 1990 international organizations adopted a
   definition of poverty in line with the poverty lines in low-income
   countries. In the latest adjustment the international poverty line is
   set to the threshold of living on less than $1.90 per day. That is a
   very poverty line and focusses on what is happening to the very poorest
   people on the planet.^4

   The same international organizations that set the poverty line made it
   a global goal to end extreme poverty. Goal number one of the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed on by all nations in the
   world, is the “eradication of extreme poverty for all people
   everywhere”. The deadline for achieving this goal is 2030. Can we
   expect to achieve this?

   Half a billion projected to live in extreme poverty in 2030

   Research teams from the World Bank, ODI, the IHME, and Brookings
   jointly with the World Data Lab made independent projections for what
   we can expect for global poverty during the SDG era.

   While the projections differ in methodology and underlying assumptions,
   it’s striking how much they align in their projection for what to
   expect in the coming decade if the world stays on current trajectories.
   All expect some positive development – the number of people in extreme
   poverty is expected to continue to decline – but all also agree on the
   bad headline: the world is not on track to end extreme poverty by 2030.

   The chart shows the projection made by the development research team at
   the World Bank. This projection answers the question of what would
   happen to extreme poverty trends if the economic growth of the past
   decade (2005–15) continued until 2030:^5 The number of people in
   extreme poverty will stagnate at almost 500 million.

   Extreme poverty projection by the world bank to 2030

   This is not because it is not possible to end extreme poverty. In more
   than half of the countries of the world the share of the population in
   extreme poverty is now less than 3 percent.^6 In the same countries the
   huge majority – even in today’s richest countries – lived in extreme
   poverty just a few generations ago.

   In fact, the big success over the last generation was that the world
   made rapid progress against the very worst poverty. The number of
   people in extreme poverty has fallen from nearly 1.9 billion in 1990 to
   about 650 million in 2018.^7

   This was possible as economic growth reached more and more parts of the
   world.^8 In Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Ghana, and China more than half
   the population lived in extreme poverty a generation ago. But after two
   decades of growth the share in extreme poverty more than halved in all
   these countries.

   Poverty was not concentrated in Africa until recently. In 1990 more
   than a billion of the extremely poor lived in China and India alone.
   Since then those economies have grown faster than many of the richest
   countries in the world and did much to a reduction of global
   inequality. The concentration of the world’s poorest shifted from East
   Asia in the 1990s to South Asia in the following decade. Now it has
   shifted to Sub-Saharan Africa. The projections suggest the geographic
   concentration of extreme poverty is likely to continue. According to
   the World Bank forecasts 87% of the world’s poorest are expected to
   live in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2030 if economic growth follows the
   trajectory over the recent past.

   Poverty declined during the last generation because the majority of the
   poorest people on the planet lived in countries with strong economic
   growth. This is now different.

   Stagnation for the poorest

   Many of the world’s poorest today live in countries that had very low
   economic growth in the past.^9 Consider the case of Madagascar: In the
   last 20 years GDP per capita has not grown; and the number in extreme
   poverty increased almost one-for-one with total population.

   Development economists have emphasized this for some time: The very
   poorest people in the world did not see their material living
   conditions improve.^10 This fact is surely one of the biggest
   development failures of our time. Yet the stagnation of the world’s
   poorest countries is not as widely known as it should be – one reason
   is that we are not paying attention to poverty lines low enough to
   focus on what happens to the very poorest. This is an important
   reminder that one poverty line is not enough and we need to rely on
   several poverty lines – higher and lower than the international poverty
   line – to understand what is happening.

   A rising global middle class and stagnation of the world’s poorest will
   also mean that a new divide at the lowest end of the global income
   distribution is opening up. We miss this if we only follow what is
   happening to the rapidly emerging global middle class or if we rely on
   global poverty lines that are not capturing what is happening to the
   poorest.

   The projections suggest that over the coming decade the stagnation at
   the bottom will become very clear. The majority of the world’s poorest
   today live in economies that are not growing and half a billion face
   the prospect to remain stuck in extreme poverty.

   This is terrible news.

   Policy and growth

   These projections describe what we have to expect on current trends.
   But current trends don’t have to become future trends: all countries
   that left extreme poverty behind had a moment at which they broke out
   of stagnation.

   The second big lesson from the history of extreme poverty is that it is
   the growth of an entire economy that lifts individuals out of poverty.
   Key for ending extreme poverty globally will be that the poorest
   countries achieve the difficult task of economic growth.

   But it’s not only about macroeconomic performance. Social policy and
   direct household-level support, too, make an important difference. Even
   in very poor economies there is scope for targeted policies to support
   the very poorest. In an analysis of how today’s richest countries left
   extreme poverty behind Martin Ravallion emphasizes the role the
   expanded social protection policies played at the time.^11

   The most important task in our time is to ensure that the living
   conditions of the world’s poorest improve and to end extreme poverty.
   We know that it is possible; we have done it many times in the past.

   The big success of the last generation was that global extreme poverty
   declined rapidly. But many are still very poor and progress against
   extreme poverty is urgently needed. However, we are currently far off
   track to ending extreme poverty – we expect half a billion people to
   still live on less than $1.90 per day by 2030. To ensure that ‘no one
   is left behind’ as the SDG agenda promises, this is where we need to
   focus our efforts.

   It’s not just a concern until 2030: without rising incomes in the
   worst-off places extreme poverty will remain a reality for millions.

Extreme poverty in the broader context of well-being

Is poverty only about consumption?

   There are many ways in which researchers and policymakers try to
   measure welfare. In this entry we focus mainly on welfare as measured
   by ‘monetized’ consumption and income, following the approach used by
   the World Bank. However, as we emphasize throughout, this is only one
   of many aspects that we need to consider when discussing poverty. In
   other entries in Our World In Data we discuss evidence that allows
   tracking progress in other aspects of welfare that are not captured by
   standard economic indicators. This broad perspective on global
   development is at the heart of our publication.

   The practice of measuring welfare via consumption and income has a long
   tradition in economics. Many classic textbooks and papers provide
   details regarding the conceptual framework behind this (for a basic
   technical overview see Deaton and Zaidi 2002);^12 and by now there is
   also an extensive literature discussing various important points of
   contention (see Ch 2. in Atkinson 2016 for a brief recent overview).^13

   Alternative starting points for measuring welfare include subjective
   views (e.g. self-reported life satisfaction), basic needs (e.g. caloric
   requirements), capabilities (e.g. access to education), and minimum
   rights (e.g. human rights).

   These alternative notions of welfare play an important role in academia
   and policy, and it is necessary to bear in mind that they are
   interrelated. Indeed, as we explain below, many of these concepts
   indirectly enter the methodology used by the World Bank to measure
   poverty; for example, by helping set the poverty lines against which
   monetized consumption is assessed.

   This table, from Atkinson (2016) provides a comparison of the
   ‘money-metric approach’ used by the World Bank vis-à-vis the most
   common alternatives.

What do poor people think about poverty?

   The most important conclusion from the evidence presented in this entry
   is that extreme poverty, as measured by consumption, has been going
   down around the world in the last two centuries. But why should we
   care? Is it not the case that poor people might have less consumption
   but enjoy their lives just as much—or even more—than people with much
   higher consumption levels?

   One way to find out is to simply ask. Subjective views are an important
   way of measuring welfare.

   This is what the Gallup Organization did. The Gallup World Poll asked
   people around the world what they thought about their standard of
   living—not only about their income. The following chart compares the
   answers of people in different countries with the average income
   in those countries. It shows that, broadly speaking, people living in
   poorer countries tend to be less satisfied with their living standards.

Dissatisfaction with standard of living vs GDP per capita^14

   Dissatisfied vs income

   This suggests that economic prosperity is not a vain, unimportant goal
   but rather a means for a better life. The correlation between rising
   incomes and higher self-reported life satisfaction is shown in our
   entry on happiness.

   This is more than a technical point about how to measure welfare. It is
   an assertion that matters for how we understand and interpret
   development.

   First, the smooth relationship between income and subjective well-being
   highlights the difficulties that arise from using a fixed threshold
   above which people are abruptly considered to be non-poor. In reality,
   subjective well-being does not suddenly improve above any given poverty
   line. This makes using a fixed poverty line to define destitution as a
   binary ‘yes/no’ problematic. Therefore, while the International Poverty
   Line is useful for understanding the changes in living conditions of
   the very poorest of the world, we must also take into account higher
   poverty lines reflecting the fact that living conditions at higher
   thresholds can still be destitute.

   And second, the fact that people with very low incomes tend to be
   dissatisfied with their living standards shows that it would be
   incorrect to take a romantic view on what ‘life in poverty’ is like. As
   the data shows, there is just no empirical evidence that would suggest
   that living with very low consumption levels is romantic.

   A disregard for or disinterest in poverty estimates that are calculated
   on the basis of low consumption and income levels is partly explained
   by the fact that it can be very difficult for people to imagine what it
   is like to live with very little. Even economists who think a lot about
   income and poverty find it difficult to understand what it means to
   live on a given income level. It is just hard to picture what life is
   like when all you know is a “dollar-per-day” figure.

   To address this, Anna Rosling Rönnlund put together a captivating,
   visual project at Gapminder.org in which she portrays the living
   conditions of people living at different income levels. In Dollar
   Street you can find portraits of families and see how they cook, what
   they eat, how they sleep, what toilets they have available, what their
   children’s toys look like, and much more.

Extreme poverty in a historical perspective

Historical poverty around the world

The share of people in extreme poverty over the past two centuries

   The World Bank only publishes data on extreme poverty from 1981
   onwards, but researchers have reconstructed information about the
   living standards of the more distant past. The seminal paper on this
   was written by Bourguignon and Morrison in 2002.^15 In this paper, the
   two authors reconstruct measures of poverty as far back as 1820. The
   poverty line of 1.90 int.-$ per day was just introduced in 2015, so the
   2002 paper uses the measure of ‘one dollar per day’. This difference in
   the definition of poverty should be kept in mind when comparing the
   following graph to those discussed in other sections of this entry.

   In 1820, the vast majority of people lived in extreme poverty and only
   a tiny elite enjoyed higher standards of living. Economic growth over
   the last 200 years completely transformed our world, with the share of
   the world population living in extreme poverty falling continuously
   over the last two centuries. This is even more remarkable when we
   consider that the population increased 7-fold over the same time. In a
   world without economic growth, an increase in the population would
   result in less and less income for everyone. A 7-fold increase in the
   world population would be potentially enough to drive everyone into
   extreme poverty. Yet, the exact opposite happened. In a time of
   unprecedented population growth, we managed to lift more and more
   people out of the extreme poverty of the past.

   It is very difficult to compare income or consumption levels over long
   periods of time because the available goods and services tend to change
   significantly, to the extent where even completely new goods and
   services emerge. This point is so significant that it would not be
   incorrect to claim that every person in the world was extremely poor in
   the 19th century. Nathan Rothschild was surely the richest man in the
   world when he died in 1836. But the cause of his death was an
   infection—a condition that can now be treated with antibiotics sold for
   less than a couple of cents. Today, only the very poorest people in the
   world would die in the way that the richest man of the 19th century
   died. This example is a good indicator of how difficult it is to judge
   and compare levels of prosperity and poverty, especially for the
   distant past.

   The trend over time becomes more clear if one compares the availability
   of necessities like food, housing, clothing, and energy. As more and
   more countries industrialized and increased the productivity of work,
   their economies started to grow and poverty began to decline. According
   to Bourguignon and Morrison—and as seen in the graph below—only a
   little more than a quarter of the world population was not living in
   poverty by 1950.

   From 1981 onwards, we have better empirical data on global extreme
   poverty. The Bourguignon and Morrison estimates for the past are based
   on national accounts and additional information on the level of
   inequality within countries. The data from 1981 onwards come from the
   World Bank, which bases their estimates on household surveys. (See
   below for more on where historical poverty estimates come from).

   According to these household surveys, 44% of the world population lived
   in extreme poverty in 1981. Since then, the share of extremely poor
   people in the world has declined very fast—in fact, faster than ever
   before in world history. In 32 years, the share of people living in
   extreme poverty was divided by 4, reaching levels below 10% in 2015.

   There is also an interactive version of the below graph.

Share of the World Population living in Absolute Poverty, 1820-2015^16

   World-Poverty-Since-1820

The number of people in extreme poverty over the past two centuries

   We have seen that the chance of being born into extreme poverty has
   declined dramatically over the last 200 years. But what about the
   absolute number of people living in extreme poverty?

   The visualization below combines the information on the share of
   extreme poverty shown in the last chart, with the number of people
   living in the world. For the years prior to 1980, we use the mid-point
   of the estimates from Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) as shown in the
   previous chart; from 1981, we use the World Bank estimates.

   As we can see, in 1820 there were just under 1.1 billion people in the
   world, of which the large majority lived in extreme poverty. Over the
   next 150 years, the decline of poverty was not fast enough to offset
   the very rapid rise of the world population, so the number of non-poor
   and poor people increased. Since around 1970, however, we are living in
   a world in which the number of non-poor people is rising, while the
   number of extremely poor people is falling. According to the estimates
   shown below, there were close to 2 billion people living in extreme
   poverty in the early 1980s, and there were 735 million people living in
   extreme poverty in 2015.

   In 1990, there were 1.9 billion people living in extreme poverty. With
   a reduction to 735 million in 2015, this means that on average, every
   day in the 25 years between 1990 and 2015, 128,00 fewer people were
   living in extreme poverty.^17

   On every day in the last 25 years there could have been a newspaper
   headline reading, “The number of people in extreme poverty fell by
   128,000 since yesterday”. Unfortunately, the slow developments that
   entirely transform our world never make the news, and this is the very
   reason why we are working on this online publication.

   Recently this decline got even faster and in the 7 years from 2008 to
   2015 the headline could have been “Number of people in extreme poverty
   fell by 192,000 since yesterday”. In the recent past we saw the fastest
   reduction of the number of people in extreme poverty ever.

   While the reduction to 10% is a major achievement of humanity it is
   still absolutely unacceptable that every tenth person in the world
   lives in extreme poverty. What our history shows us is that it is
   possible to reduce extreme poverty it is on us to end extreme poverty
   as soon as possible.

Historical poverty in today’s rich countries

   We have already pointed out that in the thousands of years before
   the beginning of the industrial era, the vast majority of the world
   population lived in conditions that we would call extreme poverty
   today. Productivity levels were low and food was scarce—material living
   standards were generally very low.

   The first countries in which people improved their living conditions
   were those that industrialized first. The chart below shows the decline
   of extreme poverty in these countries.

   These estimates come from Ravallion (2015).^18 They use a poverty line
   of 1.25 int.-$ in 2005 prices, and they rely on incomes measured from
   national accounts. The ‘national accounts’ method to estimate poverty
   is based on academic studies that reconstruct historical income levels
   from cross-country macro estimates on economic output and inequality.
   (See below for more on the ‘national accounts’ method to estimate
   poverty ).

   Two points are worth emphasizing.

   First, we can see that extreme poverty was very common in today’s rich
   countries until fairly recently; in fact, in most of these countries
   the majority of the population lived in extreme deprivation only a few
   generations ago. Progress was made at a fast pace—in some cases even at
   a constant pace. We can definitely end extreme poverty in low income
   countries, and we can do it soon. Other countries have done it before.

   Second, we can also see from this chart that despite remarkable
   progress, in some rich countries—notably the United States—a fraction
   of the population still lives in extreme poverty. This is the result of
   exceptionally high income inequality. (See below for more on extreme
   poverty in rich countries).

Extreme poverty around the world today

The evolution of extreme poverty, country by country

Prevalence of poverty – the poverty headcount ratio at 1.90 int.-$

   The most straightforward way to measure poverty is to set a poverty
   line and to count the number of people living with incomes or
   consumption levels below that poverty line. This is the so-called
   poverty headcount ratio.

   Measuring poverty by the headcount ratio provides information that is
   straightforward to interpret; by definition, it tells us the share of
   the population living with consumption (or incomes) below some minimum
   level.

   The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than 1.90
   int.-$. In the map below we show available estimates of the extreme
   poverty headcount ratio, country by country.

   The map shows the latest available estimates by default, but with the
   slider (immediately below the map) you can explore changes over time.
   You can also switch to the ‘chart’ tab to see the change over time for
   individual countries or world regions; or you simply click on a country
   to see how the poverty headcount ratio has changed.

   Estimates are again expressed in international dollars (int.-$) using
   2011 PPP conversion rates. This means that figures account for
   different price levels in different countries, as well as for
   inflation.

Prevalence of poverty – the poverty headcount ratio at 3.10 int.-$

   Extreme poverty, as defined by the World Bank, is indeed extreme –
   living on $1.90 per day is very difficult. Hence, it is both
   interesting and important to measure poverty with higher poverty lines.
   The World Bank also reports poverty headcount ratios using a higher
   line at 3.10 int.-$, and the second map below shows the corresponding
   estimates.

Average intensity of poverty – the poverty gap index

   Measuring poverty through headcount ratios fails to capture the
   intensity of poverty—individuals with consumption levels marginally
   below the poverty line are counted as being poor just as individuals
   with consumption levels much further below the poverty line.

   The most common way to deal with this is to measure the intensity of
   poverty, by calculating the amount of money required by a poor
   household in order to reach the poverty line. In other words, the most
   common approach is to calculate the income or consumption shortfall
   from the poverty line.

   To produce aggregate statistics, the sum of all such shortfalls across
   the entire population in a country (counting the non-poor as having
   zero shortfall) is often expressed in per capita terms. This is then
   the mean shortfall from the poverty line.

   The ‘poverty gap index’—a common statistic routinely estimated by the
   World Bank—takes the mean shortfall from the poverty line, and divides
   it by the value of the poverty line. It tells us the fraction of the
   poverty line that people are missing, on average, in order to escape
   poverty.

   The following map plots available estimates for the poverty gap index,
   country by country. As we can see, there is a clear positive
   correlation between the incidence of poverty and the intensity of
   poverty: sub-Saharan Africa, where the share of people below the
   poverty line is higher, is also the region where people tend to be
   furthest below the poverty line.

   Interestingly, the correlation is very strong, but is far from perfect.
   For example, Bangladesh and Bolivia have relatively similar poverty
   gaps (the mean shortfall is close to 3% of the poverty line), but they
   have very different poverty rates (the share of population in poverty
   in Bangladesh is 14.8%, while in Bolivia it is 7.1%). This can be
   appreciated in a scatter plot of poverty headcount rates vs. poverty
   gap indices.

Total intensity of poverty in monetary terms – the absolute poverty gap

   As discussed above, the poverty gap index is often used in policy
   discussions because it has an intuitive unit (percent mean shortfall)
   that allows for meaningful comparisons regarding the relative intensity
   of poverty. But given that the poverty line is very low, and some
   countries have more poor people than others, it’s often easy to lose
   perspective on the actual absolute magnitude of the numbers we are
   dealing with.

   The following two visualizations show the absolute yearly monetary
   value of the poverty gap, for the world (top chart) and country by
   country (bottom chart). The numbers come from multiplying the poverty
   gap index, by both the poverty line and total population.

   As we can see, the monetary value of the global poverty gap today is
   about half of what it was a decade ago. This shows that in recent years
   we have substantially reduced both the incidence and the intensity of
   poverty.

   You can read about these estimates in the context of the ‘cost of
   ending extreme poverty’ in our related blog post.

The Chinese effect on global poverty trends

   All of the evidence above suggests that the population living in
   extreme poverty has fallen very substantially in the last 200 years
   across the world. As we have noted, on aggregate, the global population
   in extreme poverty went from 80% in 1820 to 10% in the latest
   estimates.

   This remarkable achievement was largely, though not exclusively, due to
   the important historical improvements of living conditions in China.
   The following chart shows this by plotting poverty rates in the world,
   with and without China. We see that the reduction of global poverty has
   been substantial even when we do not take into account the poverty
   reduction in China. In 1981 almost one third (29%) of the non-Chinese
   world population was living in extreme poverty. By 2013, this share had
   fallen to 12%.

The (mis)perceptions about poverty trends

   Despite the clear evidence, many people are not aware of the fact that
   extreme poverty is declining across the world.

   The chart below shows the perceptions that survey-respondents in the UK
   have regarding global achievements in poverty reductions. While
   the share of extremely poor people has fallen faster than ever before
   in history over the last 30 years, the majority of people in the UK
   thinks that the opposite has happened, and that poverty has increased!

   The chart below presents evidence from a survey in the UK, but
   ignorance of global development is even greater in other countries that
   were also surveyed. The extent of ignorance in the UK is particularly
   bad if we take into account that the shown result corresponds to a
   population with a university degree. See the Gapminder Ignorance
   Project for more evidence.

   A more recent survey commissioned by Oxfam and others asked similar
   questions in poorer countries.^20 They find that there are considerable
   differences in the answers provided in rich and poor countries: in
   Germany and the US only 8% of the survey respondents know that extreme
   poverty has declined, while in India and China the corresponding
   figures are 27% and 50% respectively.

The evolution of poverty by world regions

Total population in extreme poverty, by world regions

   Above, we provided an overview of recent poverty trends country by
   country. Here we focus on trends from a regional perspective.

   The first chart below provides regional estimates of poverty counts –
   the total number of people living below the International Poverty Line
   in each world region. The second chart provides regional estimates of
   poverty rates – the share of population in each region living below the
   International Poverty Line.

   Figures correspond to the International Poverty Line, at 1.90 int.$ in
   2011 PPP prices.

   As we can see, globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty
   fell by more than 1 billion during the period; from 1.9 billion in 1990
   to 0.73 billion in 2015. On average, the number of people living in
   extreme poverty declined by 47 million every year since 1990. On any
   average day the number of people in extreme poverty declined by 130,000
   people.

   In Sub-Saharan Africa however the number of people in extreme poverty
   has increased and we explained at the beginning of this entry various
   projections expect that extreme poverty will be increasingly
   concentrated in Africa.

   The following chart shows that the share of people living in extreme
   poverty has fallen even faster. This very positive development has been
   possible in part due to the remarkable improvements in East Asia and
   the Pacific, where poverty rates went from 81% in 1981 to 2.3% in 2015.

Distribution of population between different poverty thresholds

   The visualisation below uses PovcalNet data to show the distribution of
   the world population across different poverty thresholds.^22 This shows
   a fantastic achievement: Independently of which of the shown thresholds
   you think should be the appropriate poverty line, the result is the
   same. The global poverty rate has been falling across all these poverty
   lines.

   Today, almost two-thirds of the world population live below 10 dollars
   per day. This explains why, if we want to focus on those who are worst
   off, we need to rely on very low poverty lines, such as the $1.90 and
   $3.20 lines employed by the World Bank.^23

   This visualization shows that most progress has been achieved for the
   two lowest lines, for the future the expectation is unfortunately not
   that this development will continue at the same speed, as we explain in
   detail at the beginning of the entry.

   The next visualization shows the number, rather than the share, of
   people between the different poverty thresholds. (You can always switch
   between this and the previous chart by clicking on the visualization
   and toggling the button labelled ‘relative’.)

   For more than a decade, the number of people living under the three
   lowest poverty lines has been on the decline. So, independently of
   which of these poverty lines you choose, not only have poverty rates
   declined, but the total number of people living in poverty has also
   fallen.

   There is still much work to be done. The global economic inequality is
   very high and most of the world population are very poor by the
   standards of rich countries – even 10 dollars per day provides a very
   low standard of living. What we have seen over the last 34 years
   however is that the incomes of the poorer half of the global population
   have been increasing.

The demographics of extreme poverty

How many poor people live in each country?

   The global incidence of extreme poverty has gone down from almost 100%
   in the 19th century, to 10.7% in 2013. While this is a great
   achievement, there is absolutely no reason to be complacent: a poverty
   rate of 10.7% means a total poverty headcount of 746 million people.

   Where do they live? The following visualization provides a breakdown of
   this figure by continent and country.

   These figures come from multiplying estimates of poverty rates by the
   corresponding estimates of total population in those countries. The
   poverty rate estimates come from the World Bank (2016 PovCal release,
   using 2013 household survey data);^24 and total population estimates
   come from the World Development Indicators.

   As usual with World Bank estimates, poverty measures are adjusted to
   account for differences in price levels between countries. This is
   reflected in the ‘international dollar’ metric used to measure incomes.

   As we can see, today, Africa is the continent with the largest number
   of people living in extreme poverty. The breakdown by continent is as
   follows:
     * 383 Million in Africa
     * 327 Million in Asia
     * 19 Million in South America
     * 13 Million in North America
     * 2.5 Million in Oceania
     * 0.7 Million in Europe

   We can also see that India is the country with the largest number of
   people living in extreme poverty (218 million people), with Nigeria and
   the Congo (DRC) following with 86 and 55 million people, respectively.

   These figures are the result of important changes across time. As we
   mentioned above in our discussion of regional trends, in 1990 Asia was
   the world region with the largest number of poor people (505 million in
   South Asia, plus 966 million in East Asia and the Pacific). However,
   with rapid economic growth in Asia over the past two decades, poverty
   in Asia fell more rapidly than in Africa.

Who are the people living in extreme poverty?

   The World Bank Group recently published a new set of poverty estimates,
   as part of their report Poverty and Shared Prosperity (2016). These
   estimates, explained in detail in two related background papers
   (Newhouse et al. 2016 and Castaneda et al. 2016)^25 are consistent with
   the official World Bank poverty figures published in Povcal and the
   World Development Indicators, but they are disaggregated by key
   demographic characteristics such as age and educational attainment.

   In order to produce disaggregated estimates, the World Bank relied on
   new data from the Global Micro Database that augments survey data in 89
   countries, by providing a set of harmonized household characteristics,
   enriching the other survey instruments used by the World Bank to
   measure poverty.

   According to the World Bank, the sample of 89 countries included in the
   Global Micro Database contains an estimated 84.2 percent of the
   population in low and middle income countries, and 82.1 percent of the
   child population.^26 In this map you can see exactly which territories
   are covered. As the authors point out, while not every country is
   covered, this new set of estimates is the most updated and
   comprehensive source currently available to researchers and
   policymakers trying to understand the demographics of poverty.

   The following visualization uses this source to provide a
   characterization of those who live in extreme poverty. As we can see,
   across all world regions the poor tend to be young and live in rural
   areas.

   In the background paper accompanying the data, Castaneda et al. (2016)
   provide simple regression results and conclude that “After conditioning
   on other individual and household characteristics, having fewer than
   three children, having greater educational attainment, and living in an
   urban area are strongly and positively associated with economic
   well-being”.

   Interestingly, and perhaps also surprisingly, we can see from the
   visualization below that those with no education are now a distinct
   minority of the population.^27 One thing this shows is that, despite
   improvements, the expansion of education around the world in the last
   decades has still not been enough to lift many households out of
   poverty.

   Demographics of the extreme and moderate poor in 2013


How many children live in extreme poverty around the world?

   Global estimates of child poverty are unfortunately not available.
   However, as we mentioned above, we can have a reasonable picture of
   this issue by looking at the estimates recently published by the World
   Bank using the Global Micro Database.

   For measurement purposes, children are considered to be poor if they
   live in a poor household (i.e. all children in poor households are
   assumed to be poor, while all children in non-poor households are
   assumed to be non-poor). A household is considered poor, in turn, if
   the per capita consumption of its members (or per capita income,
   depending on the country), falls below 1.90 int.-$. This is the
   standard definition of absolute extreme poverty used by the World Bank.

   The following chart summarizes the available data. The height of each
   bar in this plot shows the share of people living in extreme poverty by
   age group, while the width of the bars reflects the total size of each
   age group in the overall population. The area of each bar (height times
   width) gives the number of individuals living in extreme poverty within
   each age bracket—these are the numbers written inside each bar.

   As we can see, poverty is particularly high among children: in low and
   middle income countries more than 20% of children under 10 years of age
   live with less than 1.90 int.-$ per day. For adults, the corresponding
   figures are much lower: less than 10% of adults live with comparably
   low consumption levels.

   By looking at the total number of people in extreme poverty (area of
   the bars) we can also see another important fact: virtually half of the
   people living in extreme poverty are under 18 years of age. This is a
   large share if we consider that those under 18 account for only around
   a third of the general population (as shown by the width of the bars).

Extreme poverty in low and middle income countries by age group (2013)^28

   Extreme poverty by age vtwo

How does poverty among children compare to poverty among adults?

   The above-mentioned data from the Global Micro Database allows us to
   study poverty across age groups for various poverty lines—not just the
   International Poverty Line.

   The following chart shows the cumulative distribution of welfare for
   different age groups. Each of the lines in this plot shows, for each
   age group, the share of the population living below a given level of
   per capita daily income or consumption (after accounting for
   differences in prices across countries).

   If you locate the vertical line passing through $1.9 in the horizontal
   axis, you will see that it cuts the series for adults at around 9%.
   This means that around 9% of the adult population lives with
   consumption (or income) levels below the 1.90 int.-$ poverty line.
   Following this logic, we can read the poverty rates at any poverty
   line.

   As we can see, the distribution of consumption for adults is always to
   the right of the distribution for children. In economics lingo, what we
   observe is that the distribution for adults stochastically dominates
   that of children. This means that poverty rates for children are higher
   at any poverty line.

   It’s important to mention that these results do not reflect the fact
   that adults tend to generate more income than children. Bear in mind
   that these are estimates of household per capita income. That means
   that children living in households with rich adults are also assumed to
   be rich.

Poverty across multiple dimensions

How can we measure poverty beyond income and consumption?

   The methodology used by the World Bank to measure poverty relies on
   income and consumption. While informative, this methodology certainly
   leaves out many important aspects of welfare.

   At Our World in Data, we believe that it is important to track progress
   in dimensions of well-being spanning beyond standard economic
   indicators. This is why we make an effort to study a wide range of
   aspects, including education, health, human rights, etc. If you are
   interested in understanding poverty through these other lenses, you are
   welcome to explore our website—the content menu at the top of the page
   links to all of our entries on these topics.

   Tracking various indicators of well-being independently can make
   comparisons difficult, since different indicators move in different
   directions across time and space. Because of this, researchers and
   policymakers often construct synthetic indicators that aggregate
   various dimensions of deprivation, by attaching welfare weights to a
   set of key underlying metrics of well-being.

   The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) published by the Oxford
   Poverty & Human Development Initiative (OPHI), is one such effort to
   aggregate various aspects of well-being into a single metric. Different
   from other indexes like the Human Development Index, the MPI is not
   aggregated at the country level, but instead at the individual level—it
   measures how one and the same individual is deprived in different
   dimensions.

   OPHI’s MPI is widely used around the world, and currently covers over
   100 low and middle income countries. The MPI is constructed from ten
   indicators across three core dimensions: health, education and living
   standards. This table specifies how the different indicators are
   defined and aggregated.

   The MPI is constructed using three main datasets: the Demographic and
   Health Survey (DHS), the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS), and
   the World Health Survey (WHS).

   You can find further definitions and explanations in the MPI’s
   documentation. And you can find a more technical discussion of the MPI
   and its properties in Alkire and Foster (2011).^30

   The MPI is typically used to assess deprivation at the individual
   level: if someone is deprived in a third or more of the ten (weighted)
   indicators, the index identifies them as ‘MPI poor’. In the following
   map, we show the share of MPI poor people country by country (i.e. the
   multidimensional poverty headcount ratios). As we can see, this
   alternative metric shows that poverty is also particularly acute in
   sub-Saharan Africa.

How well do income and consumption capture multidimensional poverty?

   As we mentioned above, poverty is multidimensional in nature, and it is
   therefore useful to try to measure poverty through alternative
   instruments that capture deprivation beyond income and consumption. The
   Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)—shown in the world map above and
   published by the Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative
   (OPHI)—is the most common international instrument used in this
   context.

   The following chart plots the share of people living in extreme poverty
   as measured by consumption and income, against the share of people
   living in ‘multidimensional poverty’ according to the MPI. The former
   is the same metric we have discussed extensively throughout this entry.
   The latter is a metric based on unmet needs: the MPI’s definition
   stipulates that someone lives in ‘multidimensional poverty’ if they are
   deprived in a third or more of the ten weighted indicators (such as,
   for example, nutrition, electricity, or schooling) that compose the
   index.

   As we can see, there is a positive correlation between these two
   measures of deprivation, but they are clearly not identical. Swaziland
   and South Sudan have similar monetary poverty rates (about 42% of the
   population live below the International Poverty Line), but they have
   extremely different multidimensional poverty rates (around 20% in
   Swaziland, compared to 91% in South Sudan are living in
   ‘multidimensional poverty’). This highlights the usefulness of tracking
   deprivation across multiple dimensions of well-being, including both
   standard and non-standard economic indicators.

Correlates, determinants and consequences

The link between economic growth and poverty

The share of the population in extreme poverty is low when average incomes
are high

   National prosperity is a strong predictor of extreme poverty at the
   individual level. The following graph shows this relationship between
   average incomes (GDP per capita) and the share of the population living
   in extreme poverty.

   The chart shows that there is no country with a GDP per capita higher
   than 15,000 int.-$ in which more than 5% of the population lives in
   extreme poverty. And in most countries with GDP per capita below 4,000
   int.-$, between one quarter and three quarters of the population lives
   in extreme poverty.

   The scatter plot is interactive—by moving the time slider under the
   plot, you can see the change over time.

Extreme poverty decreases when average national incomes grow

   How poverty changes is not only a consequence of economic growth, it
   also depends on the distribution of incomes and how this inequality
   changes during the growth process. If growth only lifts the incomes at
   the top, poverty levels will remain unchanged. On the other hand, if
   growth is inclusive and lifts all boats, the economy is able to reduce
   absolute poverty over time. As discussed in our entry on income
   inequality, income inequality has developed quite differently in
   different countries. In India, for example, inequality has increased,
   while in most Latin American countries, inequality has fallen.

   Researchers have compared how much changes in inequality matter for
   poverty reduction relative to economic growth. David Dollar and Aart
   Kraay studied this link between growth, inequality and poverty
   reduction in a widely cited paper in 2002.^31 The title of their paper
   is the summary of their finding: ‘Growth is good for the poor’.

   The authors find that the share of income of the poorest quintile does
   not vary systematically with average income—or, in other words, that
   the incomes of the poor on average rise proportionately with average
   incomes—and that consequently, “growth on average does benefit the poor
   as much as anyone else in society”. Therefore, the authors recommend
   that “growth-enhancing policies should be at the center of any
   effective poverty reduction strategy.” The authors emphasize that their
   findings “do not imply that growth is all that is needed to improve the
   lives of the poor” or that their findings would “suggest a
   ‘trickle-down’ process or sequencing in which the rich get richer first
   and eventually benefits trickle down to the poor”.

   Twelve years later the same two authors and Tatjana Kleineberg
   revisited the question on the consequences of growth and changes in
   inequality. In their newer paper, they broadened the scope of the
   research question to study social welfare. This approach—using the
   concept of social welfare—takes into account not just poverty, but also
   the change in living standards of individuals above the poverty line.

   As in their earlier research, Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2014)^32
   studied a large number of countries over the past 40 years. The three
   authors summarize their research by confirming their finding from 2002:
   “Most of the cross-country and over-time variation in changes in social
   welfare is attributable to growth in average incomes. In contrast, the
   contribution of changes in relative incomes to social welfare growth is
   on average much smaller than growth in average incomes, and moreover is
   on average uncorrelated with average income growth.”

   The following chart focuses on the population living in extreme
   poverty. It plots the change of national average income against the
   change in extreme poverty levels over time. Each country is shown here
   over a succession of points, one for each yearly observation of GDP and
   poverty. As countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, and China got
   richer, the share of their population living in extreme poverty has
   fallen.

   One way to think about this is to consider how low prosperity is before
   an economy achieves sustained economic growth that lifts the majority
   of the population out of poverty. India in 1983 had a GDP per capita of
   1,070 int.-$. At the end of the period in the connected scatter plot,
   average income was more than 4-times higher at 4,560 int.-$. Over the
   period shown in the connected plot, Brazil’s average increased 3-fold
   and China’s average income increased even 6-fold. Persistent economic
   growth really is a very powerful force, and the findings of Dollar,
   Kleineberg, and Kraay and the chart below make this very clear.

   What is true for the recent decades is also true for the long-run
   perspective on a global scale. Without the increase in productivity
   that brought economic growth, it would not have been possible to lift
   hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty. Without
   large-scale economic growth, many more people would still live at the
   very poor levels of material well-being that characterized our
   ancestors’ existence for millennia. Seen from the long historical
   perspective, it is clear that countries have to be extraordinarily rich
   to have the possibility to end extreme poverty for the majority of
   their population.

   Growth vs poverty

The future of extreme poverty

How realistic is the goal of ending global extreme poverty by 2030?

   The declared goal of the World Bank is to end extreme poverty by
   2030. How realistic is this goal?

   Answering this question obviously requires making assumptions. The
   following visualization shows the historical decline in global extreme
   poverty rates, from 1981 to 2013, and adds a projection for 2030
   assuming (i) that the average growth rates of consumption in all
   countries will be the same as the average growth rates from the past 10
   years in each country; and (ii) that the dispersion in the distribution
   of consumption in each country will remain unchanged.

   Let’s call this a ‘realistic baseline scenario’. It suggests that
   extreme poverty will likely continue going down significantly, but will
   not drop to zero by 2030.
   [share-of-the-world-population-living-in-absolute-poverty_v1_850x600.sv

Ending extreme poverty by 2030 is likely to require growth with declining
inequality

   In the visualization above we present a tentative projection of poverty
   rates, assuming that growth rates will remain constant at historical
   10-year average values, while inequality remains unchanged. This is
   only one of many plausible scenarios. What would happen if, for
   example, we manage to generate growth while reducing inequality?

   The following visualization from Chandy et al. (2013)^33 tries to
   answer this question.

   The solid orange line corresponds to the baseline scenario (see the
   explanation above), while the gray area within the dashed lines shows
   the range of possible forecasts that could be obtained by keeping the
   underlying assumption regarding consumption growth rates while
   considering various assumptions regarding future changes in inequality.

   To be specific, the gray area in this chart shows the range of poverty
   estimates that would take place if we assume that the shares of total
   consumption held by the poorest 40 percent and the richest 10 percent
   in each country steadily shift in favor of one or the other group
   between 2010 and 2030. For the purpose of simulating various scenarios,
   the authors move these 40-10 shares upward or downward in increments of
   a quarter of a percentage point per year—which they argue reflects the
   scale of long term distribution trends observed in historical data.

   The figures in the chart below are somewhat dated, and they are not
   exactly comparable to those in the chart above (the figures below
   correspond to a poverty line of 1.25 int.-$ at 2005 PPP prices, rather
   than the updated 1.90 int-$ line at 2011 PPP prices). But still, they
   give us an idea of how much the baseline projections would change if we
   considered alternative assumptions regarding inequality. As we can see,
   the range is wide.

   Chandy et al. (2013) also present projections where they keep
   inequality constant, and consider various scenarios for consumption
   growth (see Figure 2 in their report). As their results suggest, even
   in the most optimistic consumption growth scenarios, projected poverty
   rates remain above zero by 2030.

   Ending extreme poverty by 2030 is an extremely ambitious goal.

Poverty traps

What are ‘poverty traps’?

   Economists use the term ‘poverty trap’ to denote a situation in which
   individuals are stuck in deprivation over long periods of time, and
   there is nothing they can do by themselves to escape their situation.
   The idea is simple: poverty today causes poverty in the future, so
   households that start poor, remain poor.

   Insufficient nutrition, for example, can lead to a poverty trap. More
   precisely, if physical capacity to work increases nonlinearly with food
   intake at low levels (i.e. if the first calories that we consume are
   used by our body to survive, rather than to provide the strength
   required to work), it is possible that those in extreme poverty get
   stuck in a perverse equilibrium characterized by low incomes and low
   nutrition: poor nutrition then becomes both the cause and consequence
   of poor incomes.

   Conceptually, poverty traps can also take place at a collective ‘macro’
   level. For example, low-income countries might lack the good growth
   fundamentals (e.g. technology, education, infrastructure, etc.) that
   are necessary for the high saving rates which lead to productivity
   gains and rising national incomes.

   The concept of poverty traps is important in the context of policy,
   since it implies that one-off policy efforts that make it possible to
   ‘escape the trap’ have permanent positive effects. This is the
   rationale often used to argue for ‘big push’ macro policies such as the
   expansion of micro-finance in low-income countries. Such policies are
   meant to trigger a virtuous cycle of more savings, more investment, and
   economic growth.

   As we discuss below, although unidimensional poverty traps such as
   those caused by single factors are conceptually appealing (e.g.
   nutrition-based traps, or country-level savings traps), there is little
   empirical evidence supporting their practical relevance. The evidence
   suggests that multi-pronged interventions aimed at relieving multiple
   joint constraints at the household-level, are more likely to reduce
   poverty than ‘big push’ policies on the macro-level.

How common are poverty traps?

   As mentioned above, a ‘poverty trap’ is a situation where incomes are
   stagnant over long periods, because ‘poverty today causes poverty in
   the future’.

   The following chart provides some evidence regarding the cross-country
   evolution of incomes over time. It plots, for each country, the
   national income in 1960 against the corresponding national income in
   2014. GDP per capita is used to measure national incomes, and figures
   are expressed in ‘real terms’, which means they are adjusted for
   inflation.

   In this chart, countries with stagnant incomes are close to the blue
   45° line, while countries with incomes that rose between 1960 and 2014
   are above the 45° line. The latter are the countries which experienced
   income growth over these 54 years.

   As we can see, some countries such as Madagascar, Chad, Senegal, and
   Nicaragua experienced income stagnation—they are right on the 45°
   degree line. And a couple of countries such as Niger and the Democratic
   Republic of Congo have even experienced negative growth over the
   reference period. But the large majority of countries, all those above
   the blue line, have experienced growth.

   Those countries that are far above the blue line had the strongest
   growth. Botswana (38-fold increase), South Korea (30-fold), Romania
   (15-fold), China (11-fold), and Thailand (18-fold) are some of the
   countries with the strongest growth over these 54 years.

   A closer look at the data suggests that the typical poor country grew
   at least as fast as the global average over this period.^35

   Of course, what we see in this chart is only part of the story, since
   the micro and macro dynamics of incomes can be very different. It is
   possible, for example, that country-level average incomes are not
   stagnant, but household-level incomes lag for particular segments of
   the population within those countries. Indeed, in the US there is
   evidence of stagnating incomes for those at the bottom of the
   distribution. Thus, a proper test for the existence of poverty traps
   requires a more sophisticated econometric analysis.

Real GDP per capita, 1960 vs 2014^36

   Scatter 1960 vs 2014 gdp

   Kraay and McKenzie (2014)^37 provide such an analysis in an interesting
   and detailed review of the available studies testing for the existence
   of mechanisms leading to poverty traps. They argue that there is
   limited evidence for most of the mechanisms when operating in
   isolation; except perhaps for spatial poverty traps (individuals being
   trapped in low-productivity locations), and behavioral poverty traps
   (individuals being stuck in situations where they devote the most
   mental effort to meeting daily needs, leaving little attentional
   resources for solving other problems that could raise their incomes).

   The implication of this evidence should not be that there is no role
   for policy; but rather that traditional ‘big push’ macro policies are
   perhaps not the best approach to reducing poverty. Other, less
   traditional policies might work better. Below we discuss some examples,
   such as encouraging migration, and implementing multifaceted programs
   that relieve joint constraints at the household level.

Evidence on specific strategies to reduce poverty

Multifaceted household-level interventions

   Around the world, most government programs hope to reduce poverty
   through short-term interventions that have lasting effects. While this
   is not an easy task, there is concrete evidence suggesting that it is
   possible. In six different countries, a multifaceted program offering
   short-term support along various household dimensions has been shown to
   cause lasting progress for the very poor.

   The intervention in question consists of six elements: (1) a productive
   asset grant, (2) temporary cash consumption support, (3) technical
   skills training, (4) high frequency home visits, (5) a savings program,
   and (6) health education and services.

   The following visualization summarizes the evidence.

   The light blue bars show the impact of this intervention, measured by
   the yearly average increase in household consumption, three years after
   the productive asset transfer and one year after the end of the program
   intervention. The dark blue line presents the ‘net present value’ of
   these effects—that is, the value of the benefits assuming these gains
   last forever, minus the program costs (discounting the benefits and
   costs by how far in the future they occur).

   Although the costs of this intervention are substantial, we can see
   that the net benefits are still positive and large—precisely because
   impacts are sustained into the future.

   The results below come from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). This
   evaluation technique consists in administering the policy intervention
   to a random group of individuals (the ‘treatment group’) and evaluating
   the effect by comparing outcomes against another group of individuals
   who were not affected by the policy (the ‘control group’). This is also
   the idea behind medical trials, and has become increasingly popular in
   development research.

   The full study and results are explained in Banerjee et al. (2015).^38
   They report the impacts on consumption, food security, productive and
   household assets, financial inclusion, time use, income and revenues,
   physical health, mental health, political involvement, and women’s
   empowerment. They find statistically significant impacts on all of
   these outcomes.

   Anti poverty programs

Migration as a way to break out of extreme poverty

   The evidence most consistent with poverty traps comes from poor
   households in remote rural regions—these are households that are
   trapped in low-productivity locations, but which could enjoy a rising
   standard of living if they were somehow able to leave (see Kraay and
   McKenzie 2014^39 for a review of the evidence).

   How do poor households get ‘trapped’ in low-productivity locations?
   There are many possible mechanisms—one is the lack of financial
   resources. Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak (2013)^40 argue that
   households close to subsistence are often unwilling to take the risk of
   migration; but they become more willing to do so if insured against
   this risk. This relaxes the liquidity constraint and opens a window of
   possibility for policies aiming to promote migration, both within and
   across countries.

   How large are the potential gains from migration to a high productivity
   country such as the United States? Clemens, Montenegro, and Pritchett
   (2016)^41 offer a tentative answer. Specifically, they provide a lower
   bound estimate on the annual wage gain of low-skilled male workers
   migrating to the United States from various low-income countries. The
   following visualization plots their results, and compares them to the
   benefits from the successful multifaceted anti-poverty intervention we
   discussed above.

   As we can see, the effect of migration for the poor is remarkably high.
   These figures suggest that the total lifetime value of the most
   successful anti-poverty program is less than a quarter of the gain
   every year from letting a worker work in a high productivity
   environment, in this case the United States.

   Of course, from a social welfare point of view, these effects have to
   be considered in conjunction with the effects on ‘native’ workers in
   the new host environments. To this end, Ottaviano and Peri (2011)^42
   estimate that over the period 1990–2006, immigration to the United
   States had at most a modest negative long-run effect on the real wages
   of the least educated ‘natives’. As the authors explain, this is
   possible because there are complementarities among different types of
   workers: ‘natives’ and ‘immigrants’ of similar education and age have
   different skills, often work in different jobs and perform different
   productive tasks.

   Anti poverty programs vs migration

Giving people money – conditional cash transfers

   Targeted transfer programs have become an increasingly popular policy
   instrument for reducing poverty in low-income countries. They are an
   obvious instrument to consider, since transferring cash is perhaps the
   most straightforward way of raising incomes; and when coupled with
   well-designed conditionalities, transfers can help ‘nudge’ participants
   who are caught up in ‘psychological poverty traps’ (see our discussion
   of poverty traps above).

   Gentilini et al. (2014)^43 report that 119 developing countries have
   implemented at least one type of unconditional cash assistance program,
   and 52 countries have conditional cash transfer programs for poor
   households.

   Cash transfer programs have been shown to reduce poverty across a
   variety of contexts. Fiszbein and Schady (2009)^44 provide a
   comprehensive analysis of the evidence. They conclude that “By and
   large, [Conditional Cash Transfers] have increased consumption levels
   among the poor. As a result, they have resulted in sometimes
   substantial reductions in poverty among beneficiaries—especially when
   the transfer has been generous, well targeted, and structured in a way
   that does not discourage recipients from taking other actions to escape
   poverty.”

   As the last part of the conclusion above notes, a common concern among
   policymakers is that welfare programs can potentially discourage
   work—in fact, this is a concern that is shared by policymakers in both
   low- and high-income countries.

   Banerjee et al. (2015)^45 analyze the data from seven randomized
   controlled trials of government-run cash transfer programs in six
   developing countries in different world regions and find no systematic
   evidence that cash transfer programs discourage work.

   The chart below provides a graphical summary of their main findings. In
   the top panel, the authors graph the employment rate for all eligible
   adults in both the control and treatment arms for each evaluation. The
   bottom panel replicates the one above, but for hours of work.

   As we can see, the overall figures for both employment and hours of
   work are similar across treatment and control in all of the evaluated
   programs and do not statistically differ.

Offshoring of low-skilled jobs

   Growing international trade has changed our world drastically over the
   last couple of centuries. One particular effect has been a substantial
   increase in the demand for industrial manufacturing workers in low
   income countries, mainly due to the rise in offshoring of low-skilled
   jobs. A common argument put forward is that these industrial
   manufacturing jobs are a powerful instrument for reducing poverty, even
   if salaries tend to be very low by the standards of rich countries.

   A more careful analysis of the argument reveals a complex reality. On
   the one hand, low skilled industrial jobs do provide a formal, steady
   source of income, so it is possible that they raise incomes and reduce
   poverty. Yet, on the other hand, these jobs tend to be unpleasant and
   very poorly paid opportunities even by the standards of low income
   countries.

   So, what is the impact of these jobs on the welfare of the workers
   doing them?

   To answer this question, Blattman and Dercon (2016)^46 ran a policy
   experiment in Ethiopia. They were able to convince five factories to
   hire people at random from a group of consenting participants, and then
   tracked the effects on their incomes and health.

   They find that these low-skill industrial jobs paid more than the
   alternatives available to a substantial fraction of workers; but at the
   same time, they had adverse health effects and did not offer a
   long-term solution—most applicants quit the formal sector quickly,
   finding industrial jobs unpleasant and risky. (You can read more about
   this study and the authors’ interpretation of the results in this press
   release from vox.com).

   This evidence is partial, since it does not account for ‘general
   equilibrium effects’—that is, the potentially positive long-term
   effects that new manufacturing jobs have via more competition and
   higher salaries in other sectors of the economy. But it does suggest
   that while low-skilled industrial jobs may improve consumption
   opportunities, providing a short-term safety net, they may do so at
   important costs in other dimensions of well-being.

   This reaffirms the importance of measuring poverty beyond just income
   and consumption, and of maintaining a nuanced understanding of how
   global living conditions change.

Cross-country correlates

Poverty correlates with health outcomes

   Countries where more people live in extreme poverty tend to have
   particularly bad health outcomes. The following visualization provides
   evidence of this relationship. It shows life expectancy at birth on the
   vertical axis, against poverty rates (for a poverty line equivalent to
   3.10 int.-$ per day) on the horizontal axis. The button at the bottom
   allows you to change the reference years, so that you can see how these
   two variables covary across time.

   As we can see, there is a clear negative relationship: people tend to
   live longer in countries where poverty is less common. Yet the
   correlation is far from perfect—some countries such as South Africa
   have a relatively low life expectancy in comparison to other countries
   with similar poverty rates. This reinforces the importance of thinking
   about deprivation beyond income and consumption.

Poverty correlates with education outcomes

   Above we showed that poverty correlates with health. Here, we provide
   evidence of another important correlate: education.

   The following visualization plots mean years of schooling against
   poverty rates (again using a poverty line equivalent to $3.10 int.-$
   per day). As before, the button at the bottom allows you to change the
   reference years, so that you can see how these two variables covary
   across time.

   As we can see, there is once again a clear negative relationship:
   poverty tends to be more frequent in countries where education is less
   developed. As we discussed above, there is also household-level
   evidence of this correlation—schooling is one of the strongest
   predictors of economic well-being, even after controlling for other
   household characteristics.

Measurement and Data Quality

What are the main indicators used to measure poverty?

   The ‘poverty headcount ratio’

   The most straightforward way to measure poverty is to set a poverty
   line and count the number of people living with incomes or consumption
   levels below that poverty line and divide the number of poor people by
   the entire population. This is the poverty headcount ratio.

   Measuring poverty through the headcount ratio provides information that
   is straightforward to interpret; it tells us the share of the
   population living with consumption (or incomes) below the poverty line
   are.

   Poverty headcount ratio

   But measuring poverty through headcount ratios fails to capture the
   intensity of poverty – individuals with consumption levels marginally
   below the poverty line are counted as being poor just as individuals
   with consumption levels much further below the poverty line.

   The poverty gap index is an alternative way of measuring poverty that
   considers the intensity of deprivation.

   The ‘poverty gap index’

   The most common way to measure the intensity of poverty is to calculate
   the amount of money required by a poor person to just reach the poverty
   line. In other words, the most common approach is to calculate the
   income or consumption shortfall from the poverty line.

   To produce aggregate statistics, the sum of all such shortfalls across
   the entire population in a country (counting the non-poor as having
   zero shortfall) is often expressed in per capita terms. This is the
   mean shortfall from the poverty line.

   The ‘poverty gap index‘ takes the mean shortfall from the poverty line,
   and divides it by the value of the poverty line. It tells us the
   fraction of the poverty line that people are missing, on average, in
   order to escape poverty.

   The poverty gap index is often used in policy discussions because it
   has an intuitive unit (per cent mean shortfall) that allows for
   meaningful comparisons regarding the relative intensity of poverty.

The difference between ‘absolute’ and ‘relative’ poverty

   Absolute poverty is measured relative to a fixed standard of living;
   that is, an income threshold that is constant across time. Absolute
   poverty measures are often used to compare poverty between countries
   and then they are not just held constant over time, but also across
   countries. The International Poverty Line is the best known poverty
   line for measuring absolute poverty globally. Some countries also use
   absolute poverty measures on a national level. These measures are
   anchored so that comparisons relative to a minimum consumption or
   income level over time are possible.

   Relative Poverty, on the other hand, is measured relative to living
   standards in a particular society, and varies both across time and
   between societies. The idea behind measuring poverty in relative terms
   is that the degree of deprivation depends on the relevant reference
   group; hence, people are typically considered poor by this standard if
   they have less income and opportunities than other individuals living
   in the same society.

   In most cases, relative poverty is measured with respect to a poverty
   line that is defined relative to the median income in the corresponding
   country. This poverty line defines people as poor if their income is
   below a certain fraction of the income of the person in the middle of
   the income distribution. Because of this, relative poverty can be
   considered a metric of inequality—it measures the distance between
   those in the middle and those at the bottom of the income distribution.

   Relative poverty can be measured using the poverty headcount ratio and
   the poverty gap index. Indeed, these indicators are common in
   Europe.^47 However, it is important to bear in mind that these are not
   comparable to the estimates published by the World Bank—the nature of
   the International Poverty Line is different.

How do researchers reconstruct historical poverty estimates?

   Historical estimates of poverty come from academic studies that
   reconstruct past income and consumption levels by estimating economic
   output and inequality for the time before household surveys became
   available.

   A seminal paper following this approach and estimating global poverty
   figures from 1820 onward is Bourguignon and Morrison (2002)^48. Their
   work is the source of the poverty estimates for the time 1820 to 1970
   shown above. Bourguignon and Morrison’s starting point is to
   estimate the global distribution of incomes over time. The change in
   extreme poverty is then calculated via changes in the share of the
   world population with incomes below the poverty line, according to the
   corresponding estimated distribution of incomes.

   Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) rely on three types of data in order to
   estimate the distributions of income: economic output (real GDP per
   capita), population, and inequality. The first two sources provide
   information regarding ‘the size of the pie’, while the third one
   provides evidence regarding the distribution of that pie.

   The approach outlined above leads to a natural question: How can
   researchers construct economic output for the distant past? Fouquet and
   Broadberry (2015)^49 provide a detailed account of how economic
   historians construct these estimates. It is painstaking work with which
   researchers occupy themselves for years. The generally preferred
   approach to estimating national income is the output approach, which
   relies on historical records by economic sector. For example, for
   agricultural production, researchers use church records for the estates
   of farmers, as well as accounting documents produced by farmers and
   kept in local record offices. Agricultural outputs are then calculated
   by multiplying the acreage for each crop by the yield per acre. Once
   this is established, prices for individual crops and animal products
   are used to convert the output into current prices and create weights
   for an ‘agricultural real output index’. Outputs related to other
   sectors, such as leather and food processing, are estimated using a
   similar approach applied to the specifics of each sector. Finally, when
   the output of all sectors is reconstructed, these various series are
   brought together and—using a set of sectoral weights that capture the
   changing structure of the economy—an estimate of the total historic
   output of the productive work of the population is reached.

How does the World Bank estimate extreme poverty?

   The World Bank is the most important institution measuring the extent
   of global poverty for the time since 1981. The World Bank estimates of
   poverty are published via Povcal Net and also in the World Development
   Indicators.

   The World Bank estimates are produced from three key ingredients:
   household surveys providing evidence about household consumption per
   head (or, in some cases as we will see, income per head); domestic
   price indexes and purchasing power parity rates; and an International
   Poverty Line based on national lines in the poorest countries for which
   such lines are available.

   Below we provide an overview of each of these ingredients. Ferreira et
   al. (2016)^50 provide further details.

Measuring consumption from household surveys

   Consumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World
   Bank’s analysis of global poverty.

   Consumption is defined as “the use of resources whether acquired
   through purchase (expenditure) or through household production or
   provided from outside the household, such as by relatives, charities,
   or the government”. ^51

   In principle, one could use household surveys to estimate

   (i) resource outflows (monetary expenditures, home production and
   transfers);

   (ii) resource inflows (earnings and other non-market sources of income
   such as, again, home production and transfers);

   and (iii) change in assets between the beginning and end of the
   relevant period (including savings, owned durable goods, etc.).

   Given all this information, consumption, as per the definition above,
   could be estimated directly from (i), or as the difference between (ii)
   and (iii). In theory, both approaches should give the same result. In
   practice, however, surveys on expenditures are different from surveys
   on incomes (more on this below).

   For the majority of countries, the World Bank estimates consumption
   directly from household surveys on expenditures. For a significant
   minority of countries, however, World Bank estimates are based on
   income surveys. Notably, in both cases, the estimation methodology does
   include home production and transfers, by attaching monetary values to
   such non-market transactions.

   How are monetary values placed on things like food grown at home and
   gifts from relatives? One common approach is to ask survey-respondents
   about the amount of such resources consumed over a given reference
   period. The aim is to then ascribe a monetary value to the reported
   consumption. This is done by multiplying the consumed amounts by
   extrapolated market prices. A second approach asks households directly
   about their own valuation of the amount of money they would expect to
   pay if they had bought such items themselves, or, the amount of money
   they would expect to receive if they had sold these items. The second
   approach is commonly used to establish a rental equivalent for housing
   and durable goods owned by the household.

   How are income and expenditure surveys actually conducted? Different
   countries use different surveying instruments, and while there is much
   scope for harmonization (see Beegle et al 2012^52), there are some
   basic common features that allow for cross-country comparisons. In most
   cases, surveys are representative at the national level and record
   responses provided by ‘primary respondents’ such as the head of the
   household. Respondents report expenditures (or incomes) either by
   answering questions from memory (the ‘retrospective recall method’) or
   by relying on written records (the ‘diary method’). In the case of
   expenditures, different reference periods are used to record responses
   across different categories of goods, with longer periods for goods or
   services that tend to be acquired less frequently.

Adjusting for different price levels in different countries

   Income and consumption measures available from national household
   surveys are denominated in local currency units. This means that in
   order to make meaningful cross-country poverty comparisons, it is
   necessary to translate figures into a common currency—i.e. use a
   consistent ‘unit of measure’.

   One possibility would be to simply use the exchange rates from currency
   markets to translate all national figures into one common currency—such
   as, for example, the US-dollar. This approach, however, would fail to
   account for differences in price levels: one US dollar allows you to
   achieve higher consumption in India than it does in the US.

   If we are interested in material deprivation, any monetary income
   should be considered in relation to the amount of goods and services
   that it can buy locally. For this reason, the World Bank’s
   international poverty comparisons do not rely on market exchange rates
   but on exchange rates that are based on purchase power parity
   conversion factors. Angus Deaton explains it as follows: “Purchasing
   power parity exchange rates, or PPPs, are price indexes that summarize
   prices in each country relative to a numeraire country, typically the
   United States. These numbers are used to compare living standards
   across countries, by academics in studies of economic growth,
   particularly through the Penn World Table, by the World Bank to
   construct measures of global poverty, by the European Union to
   redistribute resources, and by the international development community
   to draw attention to discrepancies between rich and poor countries.”

   PPP exchange rates allow us to translate monetary incomes (or
   consumption) from local currency units into ‘international dollars’.
   The idea is that a given amount of international dollars should buy
   roughly the same amount (and quality) of goods and services in any
   country.

   As the graph below shows for GDP per head, assessing living standards
   using PPP adjusted international dollars rather than US market dollars
   can make a huge difference. When price levels in a country are much
   lower than in the US, using US dollars at market exchange rates will
   significantly underestimate the value of incomes.

   PPP factors are estimated by the International Comparison Programme
   (ICP). The two last rounds of PPP factors estimated by the ICP are from
   2005 and 2011 and the next one is scheduled for 2017.

   this topic.

Setting the International Poverty Line

   Today, the International Poverty Line is 1.90 international dollars (at
   2011 PPP prices). Where does this number come from?

   The pioneering work that set out to count the number of people in
   poverty using a common global standard was published by Montek
   Ahluwalia, Nicholas Carter, and Hollis Chenery in 1979.^53 The three
   authors based their estimates of global poverty figures on the Indian
   poverty line at the time.

   To rely on the national poverty line of a low-income country is still
   the basic idea on which the International Poverty Line is based. But
   today it is not just the poverty line of India that is taken into
   account rather, as we can see in the following table, it is based on
   the national poverty lines of 15 different low-income countries.

   There were several major revisions between the first formulation of a
   global poverty line in 1978 and today. The table below, taken from
   Ferreira et al. (2016)^54, shows in detail how the International
   Poverty Line has been updated over time. A global ‘dollar-a-day’
   poverty line was introduced in the World Development Report in 1990,
   and was subsequently used for the formulation of the Millennium
   Development Goals and the commitment to “halve, between 1990 and 2015,
   the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day.”

   The International Poverty Line is intended to be a global poverty line
   for absolute measurement of deprivation—so it is not recurrently
   adjusted as low-income countries grow richer. However, it is important
   to bear in mind that the International Poverty Line is sometimes
   updated; in 2015, for example, the line was updated from 1.25
   international dollars (at 2005 PPP prices), to 1.90 international
   dollars (at 2011 PPP prices). This last update was made in order to
   incorporate new evidence on relative price levels, rather than to
   change the underlying real welfare standard used to define deprivation.
   In the last couple of revisions, the guiding principle has been to
   incorporate new data on relative prices while attempting to minimize
   changes to the real welfare value of the line, so as to avoid “shifting
   the goalposts”.

   The current methodology for choosing the set of countries used to
   define the International Poverty Line was first proposed by Chen and
   Ravallion (2001).^55 They compiled a set of national poverty lines for
   low-income countries—drawing from the World Bank’s country-specific
   Poverty Assessments and from the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
   compiled by the governments of the countries concerned—and found that
   while there was a positive association between the value of the poverty
   line and national per capita consumption for the large majority of
   countries, the relationship was flat for the fifteen poorest countries
   in their sample. In other words: they found that the poorest fifteen
   countries in their sample used a roughly similar absolute poverty line,
   independent of differences in their per capita consumption levels.
   These are the fifteen countries that were chosen as reference.

   The current methodology has been criticized because of lack of
   comparability in the underlying set of national poverty lines that were
   used to choose the fifteen reference countries. Jolliffe and Prydz
   (2016)^56 address this issue of comparability by estimating the
   national poverty lines that are implied by poverty rates.^57

   The set of national poverty lines estimated by Jolliffe and Prydz
   suggests, in contrast to earlier findings by Chen and Ravallion, that
   there is substantial variation in poverty lines even among the poorest
   countries. However, this variation does not seem to contradict the
   choice of the International Poverty Line: if we order the poverty lines
   of the poorest 25 percent of countries, the value in the middle is
   close to 1.90 int.-$.

   This is in line with a broader point made by Ferreira et al 2016:
   alternative approaches that were proposed for updating the
   International Poverty Line to 2011 PPPs end up generating lines that
   are either exactly or very close to 1.90 int.-$ a day.

How does the International Poverty Line compare to national poverty lines?

   The following visualization shows how national poverty lines in
   different countries compare to the International Poverty Line. The
   figures come from Jolliffe and Prydz (2016),^59 and correspond to the
   poverty lines that are implied by national poverty head-counts.^60

   As can be seen, there is a clear gradient: poorer countries tend to use
   lower poverty lines. Importantly, this chart also shows us that
   although the International Poverty Line is very low, it is still higher
   than the official poverty lines used by many low-income countries. In
   Malawi, for example, the national poverty line is 1.27 int.-$ per day.

   For reference, in this chart we have included also OECD relative
   poverty lines. It should be noted that, by definition, these poverty
   lines change over time since they are defined relative to the median
   income. They are however included to give an idea of the degree of
   variation in standards used by countries to measure poverty. While in
   Malawi the national poverty line is equivalent to 1.27 int.-$ per day,
   in Norway it is equivalent to 35.10 int.-$ per day. A person defined as
   poor in Norway can be 27-times richer than a person defined as poor in
   Malawi, a country in which GDP per capita is 58-times lower than in
   Norway.

   Most low-income countries define their national poverty lines by
   relying on a version of the ‘cost of basic needs’ method. This approach
   first stipulates a consumption bundle that is deemed adequate for basic
   consumption needs in the local context, and then estimates the cost of
   this specific bundle.

   What is an adequate consumption bundle? One common starting point is to
   rely on a generic food requirement, such as 2,100 calories per person
   per day, and then include a nonfood component that is added to reflect
   costs for housing, clothing, electricity, and so on.

   Another approach—less common but also employed in practice—is to set
   absolute lines based on asking people what minimum consumption or
   income level they need just to make ends meet. Above, we show that
   there is indeed a close relationship between the self-assessment of
   living conditions and the mean income in that society, both between and
   within countries.

   You can read more about national poverty lines in the World Bank’s
   research report, “A Measured Approach to Ending Poverty and Boosting
   Shared Prosperity: Concepts, Data, and the Twin Goals”, pages 37 and
   38.

What are the main limitations of World Bank poverty estimates?

   Above, we discussed the methodology used by the World Bank to measure
   extreme poverty. Here, we focus on the various limitations of this
   methodology. We follow the points discussed by Ferreira et al.
   (2016).^61

Data deprivation

   One of the key ingredients for the World Bank’s measurement of poverty
   are household surveys providing evidence about household consumption
   per head (or, in some cases, income per head).

   The following map shows the availability of surveys used to construct
   the World Bank’s poverty estimates.

   For all countries shown in grey in this map, there is not a single
   survey available to the World Bank in the last three decades. Many of
   these countries are rich countries in which extreme poverty is very
   low. But there is also missing data for some poorer countries, in which
   surely a considerable share of the population is living in extreme
   poverty.

   As we can also see from this map, there are some countries with very
   few observations. This is the case for many African countries, where
   there is only one survey available in the last decade. This is
   extremely infrequent, even in comparison to Latin America and Central
   Asia, where many countries have almost annual surveys.

   By moving the time slider below the map, you can see how many surveys
   are available in each decade. For individual countries, the World Bank
   publishes poverty estimates only for years in which household survey
   data is available. But for regional and global estimates, the World
   Bank publishes estimates every three years. Clearly, since not all
   countries have survey data for all years in which regional and global
   estimates are produced, the World Bank must rely on approximations. In
   their own words, they ‘line up’ country estimates to a reference year
   in order to produce regional and global totals.

   The process of lining up estimates relies on interpolation for
   countries in which survey data are not available in particular years,
   but are available either before or after (or both). You can read more
   about this process in PovcalNet. The bottom line is that the accuracy
   of these approximations relies heavily on the availability of survey
   data—the more survey years are available for a country, the more
   accurate the approximation.^62

   For low and middle income countries without reliable survey data in any
   year (mainly countries in the Middle East and North Africa), the World
   Bank chooses not to publish country-specific estimates, but still
   includes an approximated number in the regional and global totals, by
   relying on alternative statistical techniques.^63

Comparability of income and consumption data

   Consumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World
   Bank’s analysis of extreme poverty. But not all national statistical
   agencies report consistent estimates of consumption based on
   expenditure surveys to the World Bank.

   The issue is that national statistical agencies design and execute
   surveys to serve the specific needs and interests of each particular
   country; which means that different countries use different concepts,
   methods, and questionnaire designs.

   Ferreira et al. (2016),^64 show that approximately 75% of the countries
   in the PovcalNet database have data on per capita consumption, while
   the remaining countries—mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean—have
   income per capita.

   Income and consumption, as measured by household surveys, are not
   usually perfectly comparable. Despite efforts to broaden the definition
   of incomes for the purpose of measuring poverty, in many countries
   statistical agencies still use definitions that fail to account for the
   consumption that occurs out of ‘non-income’ resources such as savings
   and assets, borrowing, and some forms of government welfare benefits.

   The implication is that, by definition, zero income is a feasible
   value, while zero consumption is not a feasible value—people with zero
   consumption would starve. As one would then expect, this is reflected
   in the data. “There is essentially no mass point in any country with
   zero consumption, but many countries that use income data have a
   significant mass of zero incomes in the data, all of which are treated
   as being poor. Latin America, in particular, predominantly uses income
   to measure poverty, and in many countries there are at least a few
   percent of the observations that are zero”.^65

   In richer countries, where ‘non-income’ resources such as savings,
   borrowing, and government welfare benefits are common, this issues of
   comparability can be substantial. Indeed, in rich countries such as the
   US, the problem of comparability is so substantial that the World Bank
   decides not to include estimates of its extreme poverty in the global
   totals. This is a point we discuss below in more detail.

   The following charts from Chandy and Smith (2014)^66 show how income
   and consumption estimates differ for the US and for Malawi.

   In these charts, each dot represents a household. More specifically,
   for each household, the chart compares income per day (horizontal axis)
   against expenditures per day (vertical axis). Both measures for each
   household come from the same survey. If incomes and expenditures are
   identical, then we should see all households lined up along the
   45-degree blue line (where expenditure and income are equal).

   The orange and red lines plot the trend that best fits the data (i.e.
   the lines that best describes the cross-household relationship between
   income and expenditure). As we can seen, in the US the best-fit line is
   significantly different to the blue line: at very low levels of income,
   expenditure is significantly higher than income; and at high levels of
   income, expenditure is lower than income.

   In contrast, in Malawi the best-fit line is close to the blue line:
   households with very low income have comparably low expenditure. This
   is because unlike in the US, households in Malawi can rely less on
   savings, borrowing, and government welfare.

Comparability of survey questionnaires and sampling

   Above, we pointed out that World Bank poverty estimates for some
   countries come from income data, while in other countries they come
   from consumption data. As it turns out, comparability issues arise even
   among countries that rely on consumption data from expenditures, since
   survey questionnaires are not always standardized.

   Beegle et al. (2012)^68 give us a concrete idea of the extent to which
   survey questionnaires matter. They conduct an experiment in Tanzania,
   in which they randomly choose households and test eight alternative
   methods of measuring household consumption. They find significant
   differences between consumption reported by the benchmark personal
   diary and other diary and recall formats.

   The table below summarizes the differences in measured poverty that
   arise from the various survey designs (you can see an overview of the
   differences between questionnaires here, with more details in the
   paper). As we can see, the differences are substantial for both the
   headcount ratio and the poverty gap index.

   These results are consistent with other studies.

   Researchers have found that the recall period for food consumption
   matters for the assessment of food consumption in a population (for an
   example on India see Deaton and Kozel 2005)^69; and it has also been
   observed that questionnaires with more food items listed report higher
   food consumption when compared with a questionnaire with fewer items
   (for an example on El Salvador see Jolliffe 2001).^70.

   Studies also suggest that survey design matters for sampling purposes.
   There is theoretical and empirical evidence presented by Korinek et al.
   (2005)^71 showing that as people become richer, they are less likely to
   respond to surveys. When richer individuals or households are less
   likely to answer surveys than poor people, survey-based estimates of
   consumption and income will understate the mean level of prosperity and
   overstate the share of people in poverty.

Exclusion of high-income countries

   In the World Bank estimates of global extreme poverty, high-income
   countries are not accounted for. But how well does this simplifying
   omission capture the reality of people living there?

   A simple look at the reality of homelessness in high-income countries
   suggests that we need to take this question seriously.

   The first point that we need to consider here is that the standards
   used by rich countries to measure poverty nationally are substantially
   different to the standards used by the World Bank to measure extreme
   poverty in low- and middle-income countries.

   Consider the case of the US. According to official estimates, the
   poverty rate in the US was 13.5 percent in 2015. This figure is not
   really informative about extreme poverty relative to the International
   Poverty Line used by the World Bank: the official US poverty estimates
   refer to individuals living in households with incomes below a much
   higher threshold than the International Poverty Line. Allowances are
   made for the size and composition of households so that, for example,
   in a household with 2 adults and 2 children, the poverty line is
   roughly equivalent to $16.5 per person per day. This is more than
   8-fold higher than the International Poverty Line.

   The second point to consider is that even if we try to apply the same
   standards used by the World Bank, the survey instruments in rich
   countries are typically not suitable to produce estimates that are
   comparable to those published by the World Bank. This has to do with a
   point we have already made above: in richer countries, where
   ‘non-income’ resources such as savings, borrowing, and government
   welfare benefits are substantial, it is not possible for these groups
   to approximate consumption from income.

   Keeping these comparability issues in mind, the World Bank does
   estimate poverty rates in high income countries, but chooses not to
   include them in the global figures. This can be confusing for
   researchers—including yours truly! The World Bank uses disposable
   income data to calculate extreme poverty figures that are published in
   PovcalNet, but chooses not to include them in the global poverty
   estimates (and in many other reports such as those relying on the World
   Development Indicators), due to lack of comparability.

   The visualization below plots the available estimates of extreme
   poverty in rich countries, which can be obtained from PovcalNet with a
   disclaimer noting “Although there are a number of people with household
   incomes below $1.90 per person in rich countries, estimated per capita
   consumption is above this threshold for nearly everyone. Countries of
   this type cannot be used in aggregation.”

   As we can see, the share of people living in ‘World Bank type’ extreme
   poverty in high-income countries is very small.

   This is the same result that Bradshaw and Mayhew (2011)^73 find in a
   study of extreme poverty in Europe using data on per capita household
   incomes from the EU-SILC survey to measure absolute poverty rates in
   Europe, using a poverty line of $2.15 PPP-dollars per person per
   day.^74 In this visualization you can see their results; and in this
   scatter plot you can see how the PovcalNet estimates below compare to
   those by Bradshaw and Mayhew.

   The conclusion is that although poverty measurement instruments in high
   income countries are not designed to be compatible with instruments in
   low and middle income countries, the available evidence suggests that
   extreme poverty—as defined by the World Bank’s International Poverty
   Line—is likely to be very low in rich countries.

   post here; and you can read about the link between homelessness and
   poverty in rich countries here.

How problematic are data limitations?

   The above discussion of data limitations in the context of World Bank
   poverty estimates highlights an important fact: any estimate of
   poverty—of either its level or change over time—is surrounded by a
   margin of error.

   Keeping in mind that the World Bank poverty estimates are only
   approximations is important when making policy decisions, such as the
   allocation of international aid. Indeed, reviewing the many problems of
   poverty measurement, Deaton (2010)^75 concludes that “probably the most
   urgent area for the poverty counts is not the [International Comparison
   Program], but the improvement in the consistency and timeliness of
   household surveys, and the upgrading of national accounts.”

   The fact that the World Bank poverty estimates are only imperfect
   approximations does not mean that these are meaningless or useless
   numbers—it means that they should be used as one more source of
   information to assess living standards. As we point out above, there
   are many other complementary ways of measuring deprivation.

   By virtue of being approximations, the World Bank poverty estimates can
   underestimate, as well as overestimate the size of the underlying
   problem. It’s easy to forget about this and think that inaccurate
   poverty estimates must necessarily underestimate true poverty figures.

   As a matter of fact, there is some evidence suggesting that World Bank
   figures might be over-estimates. The following visualization from the
   World Bank’ Africa Poverty Report (2016) plots regional trends for
   different subsets of countries. The green series plots all countries in
   the PovcalNet dataset—this is the benchmark. The other lines exclude
   different countries, depending on whether they have comparable and
   good-quality data. The series for “comparable and good-quality surveys
   only”, for example, excludes some of the surveys from Burkina Faso,
   Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia; and replaces the poverty estimates of
   the two comparable but poorer-quality surveys of Nigeria (Nigeria
   Living Standards Surveys 2003/04 and 2009/10) with the estimate from
   the General Household Survey Panel 2010/11, which has been deemed of
   good quality.

   As we can seen, the 2012 estimate of poverty in Africa including only
   “comparable and good-quality surveys” is 6 percentage points lower than
   the PovcalNet estimate (37 percent instead of 43 percent).

   At Our World In Data we are particularly interested in how living
   conditions change over the long run. The available data suggests that
   the decline of poverty has been so large over the long run, that it
   cannot be the result of measurement error. Even if we consider
   realistic confidence intervals, the trends hold.

   So despite limitations, the available poverty estimates are still very
   informative about how the world has changed.

What alternatives are there to estimate monetary poverty?

   The poverty figures published by the World Bank are based on
   ‘microeconomic data’ — specifically, household surveys. A second way of
   measuring poverty is to start from ‘macroeconomic data’, particularly
   the National Accounts, which report the aggregate total economic
   activity of a nation including the GDP. This second approach was first
   explored by Ahluwalia et al. (1979)^77, and as we point out above,
   historical estimates of poverty, such as those from Bourguignon and
   Morrison (2002), also follow this approach.

   In theory, measures of poverty derived from the National Accounts
   should match measures of poverty derived from household surveys, but in
   reality there are often substantial discrepancies. Deaton (2005)^78
   reviews the reasons for these discrepancies.

   Given that both approaches are subject to measurement error, it is
   natural to wonder which of the two methods is superior. Do National
   Accounts or household surveys give us a better understanding of the
   levels and changes of poverty? Economists in recent years have started
   taking this question seriously and asked how much weight should we give
   to National Account estimates vis-à-vis household-survey estimates?

   Pinkovskiv and Sala-i-Martin (2016)^79 try to answer this question.

   They begin by noting that economic activity around the world has been
   shown to correlate with satellite-recorded data on nighttime lights
   from the surface of the Earth, which are visible from space. We discuss
   this in more detail in our entry on light at night and it is shown in
   the two satellite images below. It shows how economic activity, of
   which nighttime lights are a proxy measure, changed in South
   Asia between the years 1994 and 2010. We can see that night lights in
   2010 cover areas that were unlit in 1994; and there is also a
   substantial increase in the intensity of lights in major cities over
   the same period. This is indicative of the underlying growth in
   economic activity that South Asia achieved during this period.

   Based on this correlation between nighttime lights and economic
   activity, Pinkovskiv and Sala-i-Martin evaluate the relative quality of
   income data derived from household surveys and National Accounts. The
   intuition for their approach is that, as long as the measurement error
   in nighttime lights is unrelated to the measurement errors in either
   National Accounts or survey means, one can use night lights as a gauge
   to see how much weight to give National Accounts income estimates
   relative to household-survey income estimates in measuring true income.

   The authors find that nighttime lights are much more closely correlated
   with GDP per capita than with survey means. This suggests, under their
   assumptions, that the optimal ‘weights’ to calculate aggregate income
   should be very large for national accounts and very modest for survey
   means.

What is the cost of ending extreme poverty?

   A fundamental question that cuts through this topic is whether we have
   a good sense of the actual cost of ending poverty. The answer to that
   question is no.

   The size of the poverty gap is only a rough estimate, and the available
   empirical evidence does not provide a clear idea of how ‘rough’ is
   ‘rough’.

   An accurate estimate of the cost of ending extreme poverty requires not
   only having good data on poverty rates from across the world (including
   in countries where there are still important gaps), but also
   understanding the inefficiencies that redistributive transfers
   typically entail. What are these inefficiencies? First, transfers are
   hard to target (it is hard to reach the desired population); and
   second, transfers have knock-on effects on economic behaviour
   (transfers change incentives and hence may affect, among other things,
   baseline income levels).

   Under the assumption that these inefficiencies are not growing over
   time, the reduction of the total size of the poverty gap over the last
   few decades is good news. But it is important to note that we don’t
   have enough data to really understand how strong this assumption is.

   In brief: It is important to have more research on the inefficiencies
   that arise from redistributive transfers.

   16. The data from 1820 to 1992 is taken from Bourguignon and Morrisson
       (2002) – Inequality Among World Citizens: 1820–1992. In American
       Economic Review, 92, 4, 727–744.
       Data from 1981 onward are from the World Bank (Povcal Net).
       In more detail: The share of people of living in poverty and
       extreme poverty, shown in yellow and red, is taken from Bourguignon
       and Morrison (2002), and ‘the poverty lines were calibrated so that
       poverty and extreme poverty headcounts in 1992 coincided roughly
       with estimates from other sources’. And in a footnote they say,
       ‘these definitions correspond to poverty lines equal to consumption
       per capita of $2 and $1 a day, expressed in 1985 PPP.’
       To this we added the share of people living below the international
       poverty line which, since the revision in 2015, is $1.90 at 2011
       purchasing-power parity (PPP). The revisions in the definition of
       the poverty line and the PPP adjustment make the poverty figures in
       levels not comparable to earlier data—to illustrate this we have
       plotted both series for the time from 1981 to 1992.
   17. According to the World Bank estimates shown here, this was the
       global population in extreme poverty:
       1990: 1,903,515,870 people
       2015: 733,477,316 people
       This is a decline by 1,170,038,555 people in 25 years.
       Annual decline (on average): 46,801,542 people
       Daily decline (on average): 128,223

   22. PovcalNet is a database of consumption and income distributions
       from all over the world. It is produced and maintained by the World
       Bank, and it is the most important source of cross-country data to
       measure poverty.
       The main purpose of PovcalNet is to measure global poverty, and
       accordingly, there are some limitations that follow from the way
       they produce their data. Importantly: (i) for all countries the top
       tails of the distributions are unreliable; and (ii) estimates of
       extreme poverty in rich countries, where PovcalNet uses data from
       income rather than consumption surveys, are not accurate nor
       comparable to those in poorer countries.
       In the documentation, the source writes: “PovcalNet was developed
       for the sole purpose of public replication of the World Bank’s
       poverty measures for its widely used international poverty lines,
       including $1.90 a day and $3.20 a day in 2011 PPP. The methods
       built into PovcalNet are considered reliable for that purpose.
       However, we cannot be confident that the methods work well for
       other purposes, including tracing out the entire distribution of
       income. We would especially warn that estimates of the densities
       near the bottom and top tails of the distribution could be quite
       unreliable, and no attempt has been made by the Bank’s staff to
       validate the tool for such purposes.”
   23. In some reports (e.g. this from the Pew Research Center), the
       segment between $3.20 and $10 is referred to as ‘low income’ rather
       than ‘poverty’. In fact, as our chart shows, if you rank the world
       population by income today, and split them into three groups of
       equal size, you will find that the middle group is defined by a
       bracket close to $3.20-$10. So people in this bracket could also be
       considered ‘middle income’.
   24. Not all 2013 estimates in the 2016 data release are based on a
       survey conducted in 2013. However, estimates are interpolated
       between surveys to make figures comparable)

   47. There are two key indicators to measure poverty and social
       exclusion in Europe. The first one is based on the headcount of the
       population “at-risk-of-poverty”. This corresponds to people living
       in households with incomes below 60% of the national median
       equivalised disposable income. The ‘equivalised disposable income’
       refers to income after applying equivalence factors to adjust for
       household composition, and after taking into account social
       transfers and taxes.
       The other key indicator relates to ‘material deprivation’, and
       measures whether households can tick certain boxes, such as having
       certain goods (e.g. a washing machine, a TV, etc) or living in
       healthy environments (e.g. absence of pollution, noise, etc.)
       In the ‘Europe 2020 strategy’, one of the key objectives is to
       reduce poverty by lifting at least 20 million people out of “the
       risk of poverty or social exclusion”. Here, “People at risk of
       poverty or social exclusion” are those in at least one of the
       following three conditions: “at-risk-of-poverty after social
       transfers, severely materially deprived, or living in a household
       with very low work intensity.”
       You can read more about poverty and material deprivation in Europe
       directly from Eurostat, where you can also find data for
       at-risk-of-poverty rates at different thresholds (40%, 50%, 60% and
       70% of the national median equivalised household income), as well
       as at-risk-of-poverty rates that are ‘anchored’ at a point in time.

   57. To be precise, the approach used by Jolliffe and Prydz (2016) to
       recover the national poverty lines relies both on the poverty
       headcount and the distribution of money-metric welfare (income or
       consumption, depending on the country) from Povcal. Specifically,
       the authors observe the distribution of welfare and the number of
       people below an unknown threshold in that distribution – so their
       estimates come from finding the value of threshold that, when
       applied to the observed distribution, gives the reported poverty
       figure. You can find more details in the paper: Jolliffe, D., &

   62. PovcalNet explains the process of interpolation for missing
       reference years as follows: “When the reference year falls between
       two survey years, an estimate of mean consumption at the reference
       year is constructed by extrapolating the means obtained from the
       surveys forward and backward to the reference year. The second step
       is to compute the headcount poverty rate at the reference year
       after normalizing the distributions observed in the two survey
       years by the reference year mean. This yields two estimates of the
       headcount poverty rates in the reference year. The final reported
       poverty headcount rate for the reference years is the linear
       interpolation of the two. When data from only one survey year are
       available, the reference year mean is based on the survey mean by
       applying the growth rate in private consumption per capita from the
       national accounts. The reference year poverty estimate is then
       based on this mean and on the distribution observed in the one
       survey year. The better data coverage is in terms of number and
       frequency of available surveys, the more accurate this lining-up
       process is and the more reliable the regional estimates will be.”
   63. PovcalNet explains this as follows: “As part of this new round of
       global poverty measurement, a detailed reassessment of the 2011
       PPPs has been conducted for Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and the Republic
       of Yemen. It found that the coverage and quality of the 2011 PPP
       price data for most of these countries were hindered by the
       exceptional period of instability they faced at the time of the
       2011 exercise of the International Comparison Program. Moreover,
       the poverty estimates resulting from using alternative
       regression-based PPPs still seem to underestimate poverty severely
       in these economies, as well as in Lebanon and the Syrian Arab
       Republic (but not in West Bank and Gaza). In the Middle East and
       North Africa region, the exclusion of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and the
       Republic of Yemen and the lack of recent data on Algeria and Syria
       imply that the remaining countries account for only a third of the
       region’s population, below the 40 percent threshold of regional
       population coverage needed to report region representative
       estimates.
       Adding to this low coverage is the fact that the failure to include
       data on Egypt, Iraq, and the Republic of Yemen and the lack of
       recent data on Syria, which are likely to face increasing poverty
       rates due to instability and civil conflicts, will seriously
       underestimate regional poverty rates. As a compromise between
       precision and coverage, the regional poverty totals and headcount
       ratios are not reported for the Middle East and North Africa, but
       an estimate of the number of the poor is included in the global
       total (based on regression-based PPPs and 2011 PPPs, depending on
       the country).“

Breakdown of global land use today

   The graphic below details the breakdown of global land allocation and
   use based on areal extent. Only 71 percent of Earth’s land surface is
   defined as habitable; the remaining 29 percent comprises of glaciers
   and barren land. Here, ‘barren land’ refers to land cover in which less
   than one-third of the area has vegetation or other cover; barren land
   typically has thin soil, sand or rocks and includes deserts, dry salt
   flats, beaches, sand dunes, and exposed rocks.

   Humans use half of global habitable area for agricultural production
   (of the remainder, 37 percent is forested; 11 percent as shrubbery; and
   only one-percent is utilised as urban infrastructure).

   More than three-quarters of our agricultural land is used for the
   rearing of livestock through a combination of grazing land and land
   used for animal feed production. Despite being dominant in land
   allocation for agriculture, meat and dairy products supply only 17
   percent of global caloric supply and only 33 percent of global protein
   supply. In other words, the 11 million square kilometres used for crops
   supply more calories and protein for the global population than the
   almost 4-times larger area used for livestock.

How the world’s land is used: total area sizes by type of use & cover

   Visualising land use areas on a global map is perhaps the most
   relatable way to understand the scale of different land uses across the
   world. In the chart below we show the graphic displayed above – on the
   breakdown of global land use & cover – by scale on a global map.

   Here, land use groupings are aggregated to show the total surface area
   allocated for each. Note that these are not used to represent the
   distribution of each: this figure does not mean the United States is
   wholly used for livestock, or that Europe comprises only of barren
   land. It is used to indicate the global areal extent of each land use
   only.

   We see that:
     * global land allocated to livestock – either in the form of grazing
       land or cropland used for animal feed is equivalent to the area of
       the Americas (North, Central and South America combined);
     * cropland (minus land used for the production of animal feed) is
       equivalent to the area of East Asia-Pacific, extending as far south
       as Thailand;
     * forested area is equal to Africa (minus Libya), the Middle East and
       South Asia;
     * global freshwater (inland water bodies) approximates to the area of
       Mongolia
     * total build-up land (villages, towns, cities & infrastructure)
       would fit into an area the size of Libya;
     * shrub land is equivalent to an area the size of East Asia-Pacific,
       from Malaysia southwards;
     * barren land is equivalent to the size of Europe;
     * glaciers (permanent ice & snow) approximates to an area of
       Antarctica & Greenland combined.

How has global land use changed over the long-term?

   The visualisation below shows human land use over the long-term (since
   10,000 BC), and details the change in total land used for cropland,
   grazing land and built-up/urban area in hectares. This can also be
   viewed by select countries and all regions using the “change
   country/region” option below.

   a combination of cropland and grazing land) over the long-term,
   measured in hectares. In the following sections you can find
   disaggregated data for cropland and grazing land change over time.

How much land do countries use for agriculture?

   We use roughly half of global habitable land for agriculture. But how
   much of total land area is utilised for agriculture across the world?
   In the map below we see the share of total (both habitable and
   non-habitable) land area used for agriculture from 1961-2014.

   There is large variability in the share of land a given country uses
   for agriculture. Allocation ranges from less than ten percent,
   particularly across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and the
   Scandinavian region to close to 80 percent across most regions
   (including the UK, Uruguay, South Africa, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia).
   It’s important to note that this metric includes both land used for
   arable (cropland) production and pasture land for livestock grazing;
   this means that agriculture can consume a large share of land area,
   even in arid and semi-arid regions where extensive arable farming is
   not possible. We will explore this difference in cropland and
   pastureland in the following section.
   [share-of-land-area-used-for-agriculture_v1_850x600.svg]
   Click to open interactive version

   If we view the map below in “chart” mode, we see how the allocation of
   land to agriculture has changed over time across the global regions.
   The share of land used for agriculture has been slowly increasing
   across most of the world’s regions over the past few decades. However,
   land use across Europe and Central Asia- particularly within the
   European Union (EU) zone- and North America has been declining.

Arable agriculture (cropland)

   There are two main uses of agricultural land: arable farming (which is
   land dedicated to growing crops), and pastureland (which includes
   meadows and pastures used for livestock rearing). In the chart below we
   see a global map of land used for arable agriculture (as a share of
   total land area).
   [share-of-land-area-used-for-arable-agriculture_v2_850x600.svg]
   Click to open interactive version

   For most countries, as we will show in the section below, land use for
   livestock grazing is dominant relative to arable farming. For most
   countries, land dedicated to cropland is typically below 20 percent,
   with many countries dedicating less than 10 percent. There are some
   notable exceptions, however;  countries in South Asia and Europe
   allocate a large share of land area to arable farming. India,
   Bangladesh, Ukraine and Denmark all dedicated more than half of total
   land area to cropland in 2015.

Pastureland (permanent meadows and pasture)

   For most countries, the majority of agricultural land is used for
   livestock rearing in the form of pastureland. In the map below we see
   the share of permanent meadows and pasture as a percentage of total
   land area.

   As a contrast to arable farming, land use for livestock in Europe and
   South Asia, in particular, is typically less than 20 percent. However,
   most continental regions have countries where pastureland reaches close
   to half of total land area. In some countries (particularly in Central
   Asia, including Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan) this can reach
   up to 70 percent. Livestock farming can take place across a range of
   diverse climatic and environmental regions (for example, ranging from
   cattle rearing in temperate regions to sheep farming in hilly and
   semi-arid terrain); meaning that this type of agriculture is
   potentially less geographically-constrained than arable farming.

Cropland use per person

Cropland per person over the long-term

   The visualisation below shows the change in the average cropland use
   per person over the long-term (since 10,000 BC), measured in hectares
   per person.

Cropland use per person in the near-term

   Global population has more than doubled over the last 50 years. To meet
   the demands of a rapidly growing population on a planet with finite
   land resources, reducing our per capita land footprint is essential.

   In the chart below we have plotted trends of the average arable land
   use per person across the world’s regions. Overall we see that the
   arable land use per capita has declined across all regions since 1961.
   Per capita land use is highest in North America– more than double the
   land use of any other region. Land use in Asia– both in South and East
   Asia is lowest (5-6 times less than in North America). Rates of
   reduction in South Asia have been the most dramatic; per capita land
   use in 2014 was roughly one-third of its value in 1961.

Agricultural land use per person

Agricultural land per person over the long-term

   The visualisation below shows the change in the average agricultural
   land use (which is the sum of cropland and grazing area) per person
   over the long-term (since 10,000 BC), measured in hectares per person.

Agricultural land per person over the near-term

   If we extend our land coverage above from arable land use to total
   agricultural land (which is the sum of arable, permanent crops and
   pastures and meadows), we still see overall declines in land per person
   but with different rates and patterns of reduction. Overall, we see
   that agricultural land per person is higher than that of arable land.
   At the global level, per capita agricultural land use is now less than
   half its value in 1961.

   Africa in particular has seen dramatic reductions in agricultural land
   per person – now less than one-third of per capita land 50 years ago.
   The Americas (North and South) and Africa have notably higher per
   capita agricultural land use relative to Europe and Asia.

Land use by crop and food type

Land use by crop type

   In the chart below we see the global area of land use in agriculture by
   major crop types, from 1961 to 2014. Overall, we see that the majority
   of our arable land is used for cereal production; this has grown from
   around 650 to 720 million hectares (an area roughly twice the size of
   Germany) over this period. The total land area used for coarse grains
   has remained approximately constant over this 50 year period, and is
   the 2nd largest user of arable land.

   The most dramatic increase in land allocation is in the production of
   oilcrops. Total land area used for oilcrop production has increased
   almost 3-fold since 1961– an area just short of the size of Mexico. All
   other crop types take up less than 100 million hectares of global area.

Land use by food type

   The amount of land required to produce food has wide variations
   depending on the product–this is especially true when differentiating
   crops and animal products. In the chart below we have plotted the
   average land required (sometimes termed the “land footprint”) to
   produce one gram of protein across a range of food types.

   At the bottom of the scale, we see that cereal crops typically have a
   small land impact per unit of protein (although such protein is often
   lacking in some essential amino acids). At the upper end of the
   spectrum we find meat products, with the land required for beef or
   mutton up to 100 times larger than cereals. However, it’s important to
   note the differences in land required across the meat products: poultry
   and pork have a land footprint 8-10 times lower than that of beef. This
   means individuals can make notable reductions in the environmental
   impact of their diets simply by substituting lower-impact meat products
   for beef or mutton.

Peak farmland

Land projections to 2050-60: have we reached ‘peak farmland’?

   Is the expansion of global agricultural land likely to continue in the
   coming decades? In the chart below we see the trends of global land
   under arable and permanent crops from 1961-2014, in addition to UN FAO
   projections of arable land use through to 2050. This projection is
   published in the FAO’s World agriculture towards 2030/2050 Report.^1

   The FAO predicts that global arable land use will continue to grow to
   2050, however, this is likely that this rate of expansion (towards
   eventual decline) will be at a slower rate than over the past 50 years.
   Most of this growth is projected to result from developing countries,
   meanwhile arable land use in developed countries is likely to continue
   its decline.
   [fao-projections-of-arable-land-to-2050_v2_850x600.svg]
   Click to open interactive version

   This FAO projection of continued arable land expansion through to 2050
   was disputed by Ausubel, Wernick & Waggoner in a widely-discussed paper
   in 2013 which predicted we had reached a global peak in farmland use in
   2009.^2

    The authors, which only had land use data available to 2009 predicted
   we had reached ‘peak farmland’, with continued decline in arable land
   use of around 0.2 percent per year from 2010-2060.

   In the chart below we have plotted this ‘peak and decline’ projection
   but have extended actual land use trends through to the year 2014. As
   we see, over the period 2009-2014, arable land use has continued to
   increase, diverging from Ausubel’s earlier projection. Whilst
   premature, the authors’ model for estimating arable land requirements
   provides a useful explanation of the variables which will determine at
   what date we reach this peak. We discuss these determinants, and where
   Ausubel’s predictions diverge from actual trends here.

Land projections to 2050: when will we reach peak agricultural land?

   The projections of farmland above are limited in scope to land used for
   crop production (i.e. arable land plus land under permanent crop
   production). These estimates do not include land used for grazing and
   livestock production.

   The chart below maps a range of published estimates of total
   agricultural area over time (which is the sum of arable land and
   permanent crops, plus permanent meadows and pastures for grazing). You
   can note that the areal extent of our agricultural land is
   significantly larger than that of the farmland analysed above (about
   three times larger). These estimates come from a range of sources,
   including the UN FAO, OECD and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA).
   Also shown is the actual agricultural areal extent from 1980 onwards,
   as reported by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization.

   Some projections vary significantly – for example, the MEA scenario 1
   suggests that the world will not peak in agricultural land prior to
   2050. However, most projections suggest a peaking of land expansion in
   the timespan between 2020 and 2040. Our measured agricultural area
   appears to be most closely aligned to the FAO/IMAGE projection, which
   is characterised by a very slow increase in areal extent over the
   coming decades before peaking around 2040.

What determines the amount of arable land we use?

   The quantity of land required for arable agriculture is determined by a
   range of factors relating to population, dietary consumption, and food
   system dynamics/productivity. As we discussed earlier in the entry,
   Ausubel, Wernick & Waggoner (2013) applied a simplified model of these
   variables to predict when the world would reach ‘peak farmland’.^3

   Ausubel defines it as the IMPACT model, where land use is determined by
   five key variables:
    1. P = Population (number of people to feed)
    2. A = Affluence (in GDP per capita)
    3. C1 = Consumption 1 (in kcal/GDP), where kcal refers to the annual
       national or global food supply in kilocalories from both vegetal
       and animal sources. C1 provides a measure of how much our
       kilocalorie (i.e. food) intake increases (or decreases) as we get
       richer or poorer.
    4. C2 = Consumption 2 (in Crop Production Index [PIN]/kcal) using the
       FAO Crop Production Index, which measures the relative level of
       aggregate volume of agricultural crop production indexed to a base
       year. C2 tracks the ratio of crop production for food, feed, fuel,
       fiber, and tobacco to the supply of food calories. This means it
       provides a measure of how much food is produced relative to how
       much food is eaten (i.e. the efficiency of the system in delivering
       food from the field to peoples’ plates). If we reallocate more food
       towards feed and fuel, for example, we would have to continue
       increasing agricultural output to ensure food supplies remain
       adequate.
    5. T = Technology (in hectares/Crop PIN) tracks how much land farmers
       use relative to total crop value. This is a measure of agricultural
       yield/productivity.

   We are therefore left with the equation, where:

   Im (arable land in hectares) = P * A * C[1] * C[2 ]* T

   Or the rate of change in arable land is equal to the sum of the rates
   of change in these variables (in percent per year):

   im = p + a + c[1] + c[2] + t

How did Ausubel’s predictions differ from reality?

   In order to assess why Ausubel et al. (2013) predicted we would reach
   ‘peak farmland’ prematurely, we assessed how their predicted values for
   each of the variables differed from actual values over the period
   2009-2014. It should be noted that the authors derived their rate of
   decline (at 0.2 percent per year) based on an average prediction over
   the period 2010-2060; therefore a divergence from this value over the
   first 5-year period does not necessarily confirm these averaged
   predictions to be false.

   In the table below, we provide a comparison of the values used in
   Ausubel’s projection, and our own analysis of changes in these
   variables from 2009-2014 (measured in percent change per year). Whilst
   Ausubel predicted a 0.2 percent decline in arable land area per year,
   our analysis suggests a 0.37 percent increase per year over this 5-year
   period. This correlates very closely to the actual land in land use;
   FAO figures suggest this also grew at 0.37 percent per year.
    Variable Ausubel prediction (2010-2060) OWID analysis (2009-2014)
   Actual change in land (2009-2014)
   Population (p) 0.90% 1.2%
   Affluence (GDP per capita) 1.80% 1.8%
   Food supply/GDP (kcal/GDP) -1.60% -1.4%
   Crop PIN/kcal 0.40% 0.50%
   Technology (yield) -1.70% -1.8%
   Total change in arable land (per year) -0.20% 0.37% 0.37%

Defintions

Land use categories

   The following discussions on global land use (particularly in relation
   to agriculture) cover a number of definitions and combined categories.
   It is therefore useful to understand the differences between land use
   terminology; for example, the definition of “arable land” versus
   “agricultural land”.

   To provide some clarity on the definitions used here (and the common
   terminology within the literature) we have visualised these land use
   categories and groupings in the chart below. Also shown are the
   definitions of each. The groupings and definitions shown below are
   based on the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and should
   therefore be consistent with most international data sources.
   Land use classification

Definitions of agricultural land use

   The Land Area of the World is 13,003 million ha. 4,889 million ha are
   classified as ‘agricultural area’ by the FAO (this is 37.6% of the Land
   Area).

   The agricultural area use is divided into 3 categories: arable land
   (28% of the global agricultural area), permanent crops (3%) and
   permanent meadows and pastures (69%) which account for the largest
   share of the world’s agricultural area.^4

   What do these words mean?

   The agricultural area is the sum of arable land, permanent crops,
   permanent meadows and pastures.

   The FAO definition for arable land is land under temporary agricultural
   crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows
   for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land
   temporarily fallow (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting
   from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for
   “Arable land” are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is
   potentially cultivable.ʼ^5

   The same source defines permanent crops as follows: ‘Permanent crops
   are divided into temporary and permanent crops. Permanent crops are
   sown or planted once, and then occupy the land for some years and need
   not be replanted after each annual harvest, such as cocoa, coffee and
   rubber. This category includes flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees
   and vines, but excludes trees grown for wood or timber. And again from
   the same source the definition for permanent meadows and pastures is
   ‘land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage
   crops, either cultivated or growing wild (wild prairie or grazing
   land).’

   The FAO definition for fallow land is ‘the cultivated land that is not
   seeded for one or more growing seasons. The maximum idle period is
   usually less than five years.’

   Malnutrition can arise in three forms:
     * hunger and undernourishment, which is defined as dietary energy
       intakes below the minimum levels necessary to achieve and maintain
       a healthy weight;
     * micronutrient deficiency, which is defined as a lack of essential
       vitamins and minerals required in small amounts by the body for
       proper growth and development;
     * obesity or overnourishment, which is defined as dietary energy
       intake which exceeds requirements for maintenance of a healthy
       bodyweight.

   This data entry focuses on obesity; our entries on undernourishment and
   micronutrient deficiency can be found at the links above.

Definitions

How do we measure obesity in adults?

   The most common metric used for assessing the prevalence of obesity is
   the body mass index (BMI) scale. The World Health Organization define
   BMI as: “a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to
   classify underweight, overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined
   as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in
   metres (kg/m^2). For example, an adult who weighs 70kg and whose height
   is 1.75m will have a BMI of 22.9.”^1

   Measured BMI values are used to define whether an individual is
   considered to be underweight, healthy, overweight or obese. The WHO
   defines these categories using the cut-off points in the table below.
   For example, an individual with a BMI between 25.0 and 30.0 is
   considered to be ‘overweight’; a BMI greater than 30.0 is defined as
   ‘obese’.^2
   Bmi classification

How do we measure obesity in children and adolescents?

   The metric for measuring bodyweight in children and adolescents is also
   the body mass index (BMI) scale, measured in the same way described
   above. However, interpretation of BMI scores is treated differently for
   children and adolescents. Whilst there is no differentiation of weight
   categories in adults based on sex or age, these are important factors
   in the body composition of children. Factors such as age, gender and
   sexual maturation affect the BMI of younger individuals. For
   interpretation of individuals between the ages of 2 and 20 years old,
   BMI is measured relative to peers of the same age and gender, with
   weight classifications judged as shown in the table below^3

   :
   Bmi classification children

Is BMI an appropriate measure of weight-related health?

   The merits of using BMI as an indicator of body fat and obesity are
   still contested. A key contention to the use of BMI indicators is that
   it provides a measure of body mass/weight rather than providing a
   direct measure of body fat. Whilst physicians continue to use BMI as a
   general indicator of weight-related health risks, there are some cases
   where its use should be considered more carefully^4

   :
     * muscle mass can increase bodyweight; this means athletes or
       individuals with a high muscle mass percentage can be deemed
       overweight on the BMI scale, even if they have a low or healthy
       body fat percentage;
     * muscle and bone density tends to decline as we get older; this
       means that an older individual may have a higher percentage body
       fat than a younger individual with the same BMI;
     * women tend to have a higher body fat percentage than men for a
       given BMI.

   Physicians must therefore evaluate BMI results carefully on a
   individual basis. Despite outlier cases where BMI is an inappropriate
   indicator of body fat, its use provides a reasonable measure of the
   risk of weight-related health factors across most individuals across
   the general population.
