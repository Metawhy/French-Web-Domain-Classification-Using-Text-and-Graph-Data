Welcome

   Ian, Lisa and their team offer you a warm welcome to The Red Lion at
   Northmoor, recently purchased from Greene King by the local community
   and situated in the beautiful Cotswold countryside, 11 miles from
   Oxford. A pub full of character and charm, with log fires, beamed
   ceilings and a peaceful garden offering a good selection of wines, real
   ales and locally made soft drinks. Focusing on seasonal and local
   produce, Ian makes everything from scratch in the kitchen using a
   combination of artisan and modern techniques, providing a menu we
   believe offers something for everyone.

   Booking is strongly advised as we are a small pub with a small kitchen!

Kitchen Garden

   Both from keen gardening backgrounds, it was our initial thought when
   we saw the land at The Red Lion that we wanted to put it to good use to
   create our own kitchen garden to grow fruit and vegetables that could
   appear on the menu. Our main aim has always been to create a menu that
   celebrates the best of British seasonal produce and it doesn’t get much
   fresher than picking it as you need it straight from the garden. The
   construction of our garden started in October 2014 and although it has
   only been a year and a lot of hard work, we are so excited by the tasty
   produce we have grown so far with a great sense of pride when it
   appears on the menu! We also have a cluster of chickens which apart
   from keeping us amused on a daily basis, produce some really lovely
   eggs that we are able to sell over the counter (if you’re lucky you
   might get a double yolker!) Forever a work in progress, we will keep
   you updated on our garden project so watch this space…. Hope to see you
   soon, Team Red Lion.
