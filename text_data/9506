Hello!

I'm Karin

   Truncation means to remove the excess until you are only left with what
   really matters. In this space, I'm working on applying this concept to
   my wardrobe by practicing intentionality not only in how I shop, but in
   where I shop. In other words, this isn't your typical fashion blog.

   (4!!) loves. I’m tired, but I’m just absolutely loving these first few
   days with Gabe. After having such a hard and traumatic first few months
   with Ella and Rosie this feels like such a healing experience. I love
   how our family has come together bit by bit. Also side note: can we
   just take a moment to appreciate Kit’s budding fashion sense?

   to the Dr. today proved my theory that one newborn is a whole lot

Hello!

I'm Karin

   Truncation means to remove the excess until you are only left with what
   really matters. In this space, I'm working on applying this concept to
   my wardrobe by practicing intentionality not only in how I shop, but in
   where I shop. In other words, this isn't your typical fashion blog.

   Instagram post 2179567988678847548_2109301417 Coming soon to a blog
   post near you: these lovely new pieces from @everlaine ... I’m really
   digging the tones in this plaid! And speaking of coming soon, who
   else’s kids are excited to see the new Frozen? Kit’s been talking about
   it nonstop so I’m going to bring her and the twins to the theatre for
   her birthday. It’ll be a Ella and Rosie’s first time at the movie
   theatre so wish me luck! Outfit details linked here 👉🏻
   http://liketk.it/2H242 #liketkit @liketoknow.it
   Instagram post 2178872508063838278_2109301417 These two back at it
   again. My heart just absolutely melts whenever I see them together.
   Instagram post 2177970949566150749_2109301417 AD Matching my girls is
   one of my favorite things ever, and these matching pants from
   @hellojackalo make it even easier. Kit has gotten so many holes in her
   leggings that I finally put the kibosh on them, but I don’t have to
   worry about that with these pants as they’re made extra durable to
   accommodate for kids... being kids. Even better though? They offer 20%
   off your next purchase when you send in your outgrown clothes so it
   makes it a lot easier to invest in clothing you’ll have long enough for
   them to outgrow! I have a link to the set we’re wearing at the blog
   post linked in my profile, otherwise you can check out their Insta for
   more details.
   Instagram post 2177854093463225539_2109301417 A new week of outfits is
   up! And here’s a fun little behind the scenes tidbit: Ella locked us
   out of the house while we were taking these! We tried to yell at her
   through the glass door to lift the lock lever up, but she and Rosie
   just stood there watching us act like a couple of monkeys. Meanwhile,
   Kit was in the living room blissfully watching Octonauts. Finally, I
   started banging on the door to get Kit’s attention. She did one of
   those slow glances up, pause to look at us, then slow glances down.
   FINALLY we got her to realize what was going on, and she freed us from
   our snowy prison. 🤣🤣 So I hope you appreciate these photos ha! Outfit
   details linked here 👉🏻 http://liketk.it/2GWhl #liketkit @liketoknow.it
   Instagram post 2176672674049208906_2109301417 As promised, my cold
   weather dressing guide is up! My tips and tricks are what got me
   through my mile walk in to work during one of the coldest winters on
   record (it hit -20 more than once that winter! 😬). But not only am I
   sharing my best tips, I’m also linking to every single cold weather
   item I own and use. I waisted a lot of money looking for cold weather
   gear that actually keeps me warm, and my hope is that this post will
   help you avoid that. This post isn’t sponsored, but the wool sweater I
   recommend is by the company @oyunstudio and they have kindly offered to
   give you guys 20% off using code karin20. Also, linking everything here
   👉🏻 http://liketk.it/2GSFr I hope you find it useful! #liketkit
   @liketoknow.it
   Instagram post 2175954910506513184_2109301417 This photo speaks of past
   insecurities: I can’t wear shirts tucked into high waisted pants
   because it accentuates my post baby(ies) belly, I have to wear makeup
   to feel put together. My hair is too thin to let it air dry... the list
   could go on. But I’m letting go of all of that, and just doing what
   feels right.
   Instagram post 2175199498127665695_2109301417 It’s a loungewear and
   unmade bed kind of day. We spent the day pulling out Christmas
   decorations and making sugar cookies. Too early? Perhaps. But a certain
   4 year old was begging and I couldn’t say no. Who else has started
   decorating for Christmas? Or are you a strict “after Thanksgiving” kind
   of person?
