   on connectivity delivering Gigabit Wi-Fi for faster sharing, streaming
   and downloads^1. Combined with our great performance, innovative form
   factors, and better connectivity, new systems provide a simple,
   convenient and personal experience with more immersive entertainment.

   Introduction
   With the addition of three new SKUs, we are extending the 8th Gen
   Intel® Core™ U-series processor line-up. 8th Gen has already delivered
   outstanding experiences across three main areas: exceptional
   performance, immersive entertainment and simple convenience. The new
   U-series SKU (formerly codenamed Whiskey Lake) extends these benefits
   and is optimized for connectivity.

   Performance Leadership
   The new U-series processors build upon a great foundation already
   demonstrated by the initial U-series products. We deliver 2x better
   system overall performance versus a 5 year old PC^2, empowering people
   to focus, create, and connect like never before. For the first time in
   U-series, the Intel® Core™ i7 8565U processor enables the new Intel®
   Thermal Velocity Boost (Intel® TVB) feature^3 providing additional
   single core performance. Along with increased multicore turbo
   frequencies and hyper threading, it has the highest Sysmark* 2014SE
   score of any U-series.

   More Connected Than Ever
   Our latest PCH delivers increased capabilities over previous U-series
   products. The number of PCIe* lanes increases from 12 to 16, the
   platform now supports twice the speed with USB3.1 Gen 2 (previously
   USB3.0) and we have added Integrated Intel® Wireless-AC.
   Systems with Intel® Wireless-AC 9560 [802.11AC 160MHz] will see up to
   12x faster^1 speeds compared to a 5YO PC with a 1x1 802.11B/G/N. This
   will allow you to download content, like movies from your favorite
   content provider faster, to take with you on the go. While out and
   about in the world, you’re capturing photos and video – when you get
   home, with Gigabit Wi-Fi you’ll be able to back those files up to your
   network attached storage faster.
   Endless possibilities: Thunderbolt™ 3 offers exciting potential for
   work with multi-stream HD and 4K video. Its single-cable docks with
   charging, external graphics, super-fast storage and built-in networking
   open up fresh possibilities for everything you do.

   Interactions with the PC are also becoming more intelligent whether at
   home or on a trip. The quadcore audio DSP in our new PCH provides
   improved voice services support. While traveling, you can bring your
   Amazon Alexa* experience from home with you – before you go to bed, you
   can make sure the lights are off at home, and even have Alexa play your
   favorite music. When you are at home, Cortana* can help you with your
   personal or work schedule and search your PC for the information that
   you need.

   Battery Life
   By working with the PC ecosystem to deliver uncompromised performance
   in a power efficient platform, Intel enables more systems with better
   performance and longer battery life. There will be many systems with
   over 10 hours of battery life and pushing over 16 hours^4! You can cut
   the power cord and leave your charger at home during a full day of work
   or play.
