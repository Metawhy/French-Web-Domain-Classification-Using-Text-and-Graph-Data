Glitz and Glam for New Years!

   What a hectic year end this has been! I just realized I had not posted

   share some of my favorite glitzy, glam and shimmer faves to help you
   ring in the New Year with some sparkle!

That gift for Everyone!

   Zeitgeist is a German word literally meaning "spirit of the time," and
   refers to the taste, outlook, and spirit characteristic of a period or
   generation. NYC based Zeitgeist Gifts search for unique items that fit
   into a contemporary lifestyle and reflect products of today.
   I wanted to share some of my favorite items since someone the other day
   reminded me about the countdown to Christmas was under 100 days. I
   definitely love some of these gift items for co-workers, elephant gifts
   or just something cute and funny to bring a smile to someone's face and
   so many items are under $15!
   Giveaway: Since Zeitgeist Gifts was so kind to send me a few items to
   check out, I wanted to send one of the items to a fellow reader. Email
   me or comment below a few of your fave items from her site and the
   first person to guess it, I'll send you the item! Hint: It's not
   featured below!
   My husband and I were obsessed with this dog snout nose mug that is
   only $11! What I find so funny....the mug is white, so you really dont
   know something is on the bottom. Definitely can't wait to try to prank
   my inlaws visiting next week!
   [20160914_194604.jpg] [20160902_210430.jpg]
   My other favorite item was this roll of adhesive tape that has cute
   little sayings like "Cooked with Love", "Made with Love", "Delicious".
   For $12 you get this get that includes a huge roll of tape and 4
   markers to write on the labels. Perfect for mom packing lunches and
   snacks, someone who cooks giveaway treats. It's 27 yards of labels, I
   dont know how many labels that is, but it's a lot! Does putting a
   "Cooked with Love" sticker on the turkey sandwich I make for husband's
   lunch count?
   [20160914_193904.jpg]
   I cut my labels in the shape above and used them on my glass storage
   container
   [20160914_194417.jpg]
   Here you can see the assorted labels and styles, and its on tape so you
   can just cut at the line, or cut them out like I did.

Fein Zalkin Interiors

   I came across the beautiful work of Jenny Zalkin and Josh Fein of Fein
   Zalkin Interiors in Miami. Lifelong childhood friends joined forces a
   few years ago to combine their skills to create Fein Zalkin interiors.
   Zalkin's experience was in fashion and Zalkin's was head of marketing
   at the Design Center of the Americas ,
   [731d22219e22cfb0412755750112d200.jpg]
   I was instantly drawn to this black and white office cabinetry since
   something about this reminded me of Hermes design. Not sure if it was
   the black trim or the small accent horse.
   [037d1e1f6e4c291f08fa317f012111ee.jpg]
   Large driftwood table looks perfect against the beautiful architecture
   of the stairs. Jonathan Adler Ventana chandelier.

   Neutral palette breakfast nook is serene and a great area for casual
   dining with comfy seating
   [e86348d2f0d8284650ff4ef62374eb67.jpg]
   For those who love to entertain this was pretty efficient use of space
   for a smaller area with the built in bar space prvoviding a beautiful
   backdrop. Blue pillows in Shoeridge Lapis fabric from Aerin Lauder for
   Lee Jofa

   I loved how this offie was styled since you know this owner has
   traveled the world and wanted their mitbringsels beautifully displayed.

Framed Bow Ties

   With college football just starting, I was reminiscing about my college
   days, Being from the South, bow ties were the epitomy of Preppy Style.
   In College, guys would wear bow ties to Saturday College football
   tailgating and games. Attorneys wear them to the office, guys wear them
   to weddings and even gift a fun pastel version to their groomsmen. When
   I came across the framed bow tie collection I thought what a cute idea
   to use in a walk in closet, dressing room, man cave, or little boys
   nursery.
   [27f5a71df9a09efd8e3f9f931220eded.jpg]
   Loved this framed bow tie collection from Show Studio

   [ab1fc5f69a68c51b8b99437d705feec7.jpg]

   was a little boy, cooupled with watercolor instructions on how to tie a
   bow tie from Elements of Style

   Andy's Frame Setting.

   Amy Berry mentioned that Stark's Antelope Ax is one of the most
   versatile rugs you can use. Take a look below at all the other
   designers who seem to agree. Antelope Ax can be found in a variety of
   rooms, styles and yet it always looks great, from closets, nurseries,
   dens, sitting rooms, dining rooms.

Dallas Designer- Amy Berry

   I was so excited to share some of my favorite photos from Dallas based
   interior designer, Amy Berry. I love Berry's use of great patterned
   wallpapers, encorporating blue and white ceramics, fun art, low key
   animal patterns and perfectly styled home bars. Berry lived and studied
   design in London and has brought back the classic European style mixed
   with her Southern roots.
