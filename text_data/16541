   Adrian Underhill's Interactive phonemic chart! This excellent teaching
   tool can be played full-screen and gives clear audio examples of the
   English phoneme set.

   Note: The chart is flash-based and may take a couple of minutes to
   appear the first time you visit this page. Please be patient – it's
   worth the wait! Because this is a flash-based chart it means you may
   not be able to open this on a mobile device. If this is the case, we
   recommend you use the chart in our Macmillan Sounds app which you can

       Hi Hannahd,
       yes that's an unusual sound and very nasal! I think the easiest way
       for me to explain it in writing is to say it's the sound we make
       when we're saying 'n' and 'g' together. So for example 'ring',
       'singing', 'bring'. There will be many exceptions to this rule of
       course but I hope that's a helpful start.
       Also, here is a link to Adrian's video about learning the sound.
       Just copy and paste it directly into your browser.

       I hope it goes well for you this evening :-)

       This is a clear and useful resource. I was planning to use it in a
       class this evening.
       However, I'm confused by the sound third from left on the bottom
       row. The letter sound doesn't sound like a consonant to me and then
       the word example used is unclear and doesn't seem to use the same
       sound.

       Hi there,
       Yes it's true, some of the phonemes do still have the schwa sound
       added. This is because it's very hard to say the 'l' sound, for
       example, without adding any extra vowel sound. It would be very
       difficult to get that across in a recording.
       We've noted your comments down though and when we do the next
       update to the chart we will bear this in mind.

       Very strange chart...As a phonics teacher it is baffling how a site
       like this can get it wrong in the first place and continue to do so
       now...The l and r still have the unnecessary schwa added...the y
       and w is understandable because of their likeness to other
       sounds...For a teacher that teaches English/phonics to non-natives
       it is frustrating...especially when it is easy to rectify.

       Hi there,
       The example word is 'court'.

       Oops - I tried to insert the symbol but it came out as 3 question
       marks. It is the sound for "poor" but I can't make out the word
       used as the example.

       Hi to all onestopenglish teachers,
       Good news! We've updated the phonemic chart so that the voiceless
       consonants are no longer followed by the schwa and you are able to
       choose between playing the sound and the word, or just playing the
       sound. Additionally, we've added a US version of the chart which
       you can find here:

       Hi Andy,
       Thank you for your suggestion regarding inserting a button to
       suppress the word after the phoneme. Whilst we have no immediate
       plans to update this material, we will add this to our customer
       feedback database.
       Best wishes

       Oh, please put a button on it that would supress the word after the
       phoneme.
       I'm trying to do Adrian's sliding sound exercises and the
       pronounced word is incredibly distracting and stops the smooth
       transition of the mouth muscles.
