   Geometric Algorithms & Models
   Beyond the Linear & Euclidean realm

   Classical computational geometry usually deals with linear objects in a
   Euclidean setting and when other situations happen, curved objects are
   typically linearized and non-Euclidean spaces are locally approximated
   by Euclidean spaces. The goals of the Gamble team are to address such
   limitations of classical computational geometry.
   Our work is organized in three main axes:
     * Non-linear computational geometry.
     * Non-Euclidean computational geometry.
     * Probability in computational geometry.

   The Gamble team is part of the department Algorithms, Computation,
   Geometry and Image.
