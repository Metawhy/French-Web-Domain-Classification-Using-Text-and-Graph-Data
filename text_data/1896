          Planning and Scheduling
   Directly Schedule Posts
   Scheduling your social media posts couldn't be easier! Our vision is
   for users to have a unique voice on social media, and to be able
   increase engagement and reach of posts by targeting the message to the
   right audience on each social network.
   Create a Posting Schedule
   Each of your connected social accounts will have its own posting
   schedule. Each time that you configure here becomes a time slot in your
   queue. Then, when you're scheduling posts, you don't need to think
   about the date and time each one should be published, all you need to
   do is add them to your queue and they'll automatically be placed into
   the next available time slots and published as part of your usual
   posting flow.
   Tailored Posts for Each Social Network
   Using the Tailored Posts composer, you're able to customize your post
   for each social network that you're sharing to.
   Calendar View
   This allows you to see both your published posts and your scheduled
   posts. You can toggle between a week or month view, see engagement
   metrics on posts that have already been shared, move posts around, edit
   posts, and add new posts.
   Custom Video Thumbnails
   Choose a custom thumbnail and title for your videos on Instagram,
   Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest. Thumbnails are generated at 15
   second intervals of the video. By default, the first frame of the video
   (0 seconds) will be used as the thumbnail.
   Instagram First Comment
   When creating your Instagram posts, you can now create the first
   comment for your post, which is great for hashtags and other less
   relevant information you may not want to show initially with your post
   and caption.
   Instagram Hashtag Manager
   ​​Hashtag Manager makes it easy to create and save groups of hashtags
   to use in your Instagram first comments. Experiment with different
   variations. Reuse your top performing groups. Build a library of
   options. Hashtag Manager helps you get more reach for every post.
   —
   Instagram Shop Grid
   Shop Grid allows you to add links to each of your posts, which will
   then be displayed on a unique page that can be used as the permanent
   link in your bio.
   —
   Create and Manage Draft Posts
   All users, regardless of permissions, are able to create posts within
   Drafts. For account owners and users with Full Posting Access, drafts
   can be moved to the Queue at any time. For users with Approval Required
   Access, approval will need to be requested before the post is moved to
   the Queue.
   —
            Reports and Analytics
   Posts Report
   The Posts Report provides a history of all of your published posts.
   Looking at your posts individually allows you to draw comparisons and
   see patterns around which posting times might be working best for you,
   and what type of content your audience might be most engaged with.
   30-day history Full history Full history
   Overview Report
   The Overview Report provides insight into your overall engagement
   levels. The tables and charts throughout this report are designed to
   give you at-a-glance insight into how you’re performing over a
   specified date range. This report helps you to answer questions like
   how many impressions and engagements your posts have received, and how
   your number of followers is growing over time.
   —
          Team Management
   Invite Additional Users
   Invite additional users to contribute to the content that is shared on
   social media. All users will be able to create and share draft posts,
   and you can define which users will need to have their posts approved.
   —
   Assign Access and Permissions
   Manage which social accounts each user should be invited to and whether
   their posts require approval before publishing.
   —
   Approval Workflow
   Posts added by users with 'Approval Required Access' will automatically
   be added to the Drafts area. From there, they can request approval on
   their post, which will move it over to the Awaiting Approval area. Both
   the account owner and users with Full Posting Access will be able to
   review and approve such posts.
   —
      Integrations and Apps
   Browser Extension
   The Buffer Browser Extension makes sharing content even quicker and
   easier! It allows you to open the composer on any web page and add
   posts right to your queue, without having to go back to your dashboard.

   2019 Report

State Of Social

How marketers across the globe think about social media, what's working, how
the industry is changing, and more.

   The State of Social is Buffer's annual report focused on the world of
   social media marketing, providing you with the insights you need to
   fuel your strategy for the year ahead.

   The 2019 results have landed! This year we heard from more than 1,800
   marketers from businesses of all sizes, across a range of industries.

   Check out what we learned this year below.
   |
   A report by Buffer in partnership with Social Chain

Brands are riding the organic stories wave. Stories ads are the next
frontier.

   The Stories format has taken the social media industry by storm, and
   data suggests that more than one billion accounts now use stories
   globally on Facebook-owned properties.

   As the number of people using stories has grown so has the number of
   businesses using the format to connect with their audiences on social
   media. And it appears that those who are using stories are having
   success: 57 percent of brands believe that stories have been “Somewhat
   effective” or “Very effective” as a part of their social media
   strategy.
   How effective have stories been as part of your social media strategy?

   And with ads being introduced to stories on Facebook and Instagram, it
   appears there will be even more opportunities for businesses to
   generate value from the format in 2019. Though 62 percent of
   respondents told us they have yet to invest in stories ads, 61 percent
   said they plan to in 2019.
   Has your business invested in stories ads? Do you plan to invest more
   in stories ads in 2019?

Messaging apps are still overlooked by almost three-quarters of brands.

   Social media has become a lot more private in recent years, with many
   people choosing to share, and communicate via one-to-one messages or
   small group chats on platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger.

   Despite the rising popularity of these platforms, almost three-quarters
   of brands (71 percent) do not use messaging apps for their marketing:
   Has your business used any messaging apps for marketing?

   We also found that 50 percent of marketers are not planning on using
   messaging apps in 2019:
   Which messaging apps are you planning to incoporate into your marketing
   in 2019?

   Social Chain has already seen huge success with messaging apps, its
   WhatsApp group, for example, has seen an open rate of over 98% and a
   click-through rate of 25%. Peter Daly, Head of Marketing at Social
   Chain expects 2019 to be the year in which more brands adopt messaging
   as part of their social media strategies:

   "We fully expect messaging apps to realise their potential in 2019; the
   requirement to actively opt-in means users are much more engaged in
   these private spaces than they are when scrolling through a news feed,
   making it easier for brands to build direct and meaningful
   relationships with their customers quickly, on a mobile-first basis."

Influencer marketing is an effective strategy for brands, but guidelines need
to be clearer.

   Thirty-seven percent of respondents in our survey shared that their
   business has invested in influencer marketing.
   Has your business worked with influencers to help market your products
   and services?

   Of those brands 68 percent say it’s been “Somewhat effective” or “Very
   effective.” Still, nearly one-fourth (23 percent) of brands are
   unconvinced about the impact of influencer marketing on their brand.
   How effective would you say influencer marketing has been for your
   business?

   Additionally, 88 percent of those brands that use influencer marketing
   are also planning to continue with the strategy in 2019.
   Are you planning on continuing to invest in influencer marketing in
   2019?

   The data also revealed that the vast majority of marketers are confused
   by the guidelines surrounding influencer marketing with just six
   percent saying influencer marketing guidelines are “Very clear,” 44.8
   percent say the current guidelines are “Unclear,” with 15.8 percent
   believing guidelines are “Very unclear.”
   How clear do you feel current regulations / guidelines on influencer
   marketing are?

More and more brands turn to video content. Facebook still leads the way.

   Just 14.5 percent of businesses don’t publish any video content — down
   from 25 percent in our 2018 survey. More than one-third (36 percent)
   publish video content monthly, with around one quarter (24 percent)
   publishing video content weekly.
   How often does your business publish video content?

   Just as we found last year, Facebook is the most popular channel for
   businesses to share video content (81 percent), with YouTube in second
   (62 percent), and Instagram third (57 percent). LinkedIn is fifth (32
   percent), and could be a channel to watch in 2019, with early data
   showing that videos on LinkedIn are getting shared 20+ times more than
   any other content.
   Which platform does your business post video content on?

The majority of brands don’t, and have no plans to, use IGTV.

   IGTV was launched back in June 2018, and despite some incredible
   content from a host of launch partners and creators like National
   Geographic and LaurDIY, it has yet to catch on as a platform for the
   majority of brands to share content.

   Just 12.2 percent of respondents said their business had used IGTV in
   2018 and 72 percent said they have no intentions to create content for
   IGTV in 2019.
   Are you currently using IGTV for your brand? Do you plan on creating
   content specifically for IGTV in 2019?

Social media is a key part of marketing strategies, yet nearly 20 percent are
unsure how to measure effectiveness.

   Social media marketing has been around for many years now, and the
   majority of marketers see it as an important part of their overall
   strategy. Fifty-eight percent of marketers say social media is “Very
   important”, with 30 percent saying it’s “Somewhat important”.
   How important is social media to your overall marketing strategy?

   Social media’s effectiveness as a marketing channel has long been
   debated, and our survey found that, though social media is key to
   marketing strategy, 19 percent of marketers are still uncertain how to
   measure its effectiveness.
   How effective has social media marketing been for your business?

The rest of the data

   The insights we've shared above just begin to scratch the surface of
   what we uncovered from the State of Social 2019 survey. For those of
   you who want to dive head-first into all of the data — you can do so
   right here.
   Which of the following channels does your business use currently? Does
   your company have a documented social media strategy? What factors are
   holding you back from creating more video content currently? When
   creating and publishing a piece of content, what do you see as the most
   important aspect? Are you planning on increasing your use of dedicated
