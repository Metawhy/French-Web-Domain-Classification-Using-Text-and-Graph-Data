   [qatk_main_picture.jpg.imgw.560.336.jpg]

Atomic-Scale Modeling for Semiconductor & Materials Research

   The exponential growth in computer power in combination with new
   advancement in algorithms has in recent years enabled the practical
   application of atomic-scale modeling to the R&D of new materials and
   product design across a broad range of high tech industries.

   A key benefit of atomistic modeling is the detailed insight into the
   atomic-scale processes, which complement experimental data and make the
   R&D process more efficient through higher quality end results and
   cost-effective and faster downselection of material options. QuantumATK
   is a complete atomistic simulation toolkit developed and supported by
   world leading atomic-scale modeling experts. QuantumATK addresses key
   applications in the semiconductor industry and is a core component of
   the Synopsys Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) solution.
   Atomic-scale modeling tools in QuantumATK range from classical force
   fields for handling large and to some extent more realistic materials
   systems to ab initio tools that provide highly accurate results for
   smaller systems.

Benefits of the QuantumATK Simulation Platform

     * Define materials at the atomistic level and calculate their
       physical and chemical properties
     * Screen new materials with best properties for new products or
       systems
     * Replace or guide experiments to select and optimize materials in a
       product system

Early Design Analysis Tools Enable Efficient Verification and Optimization of
SoC Designs

   Using many advanced algorithms and analysis techniques, the
   SpyGlass^® platform provides designers with insight about their design,
   early in the process at RTL. It functions like an interactive guidance
   system for design engineers and managers, finding the fastest and least
   expensive path to implementation for complex SoCs.
