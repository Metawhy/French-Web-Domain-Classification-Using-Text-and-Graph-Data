   This is Mr. Guinther's first post to the site here. We touched base a
          couple of times a year talking mostly about the Sartrouville
          mission and the windows in Little Easton. I asked him about this
          comment in his last email to me "I regret that I am not included
          in your list of contributors to your remarkable site" and he
          never replied. I wondered what he meant. Did I not ask him for
          material the right way? He never send me anything. This is the
          only picture he send me.


   My last email from Harry was Aug 18, 2017, he passed two months later
          without answering my question. "I'm doing well, Mike. Going to a
          D-day re-enactment today and will be speaking as part of the
          program, pre-activities on the beach. I'm 94 but still driving,
          living alone in a too big house, enjoy a great girl friend, play
          bridge and cribbage, and enjoy a very satisfying cooking hobby.
          I regret that I am not included in your list of contributors to
          your remarkable site, but I guess my contribution was minimal.
          Thanks for keeping in touch. I refer people to your site often.
          Mostly researchers and WW II hobbyists as well as history
          students to come to me to talk about WW II. All my years of
          speaking before groups in northern Ohio has resulted in a
          reputation as a source for first hand information about the air
          war in Europe. We have a nearly fully completed restoration of a
          B-26 at the MAPS (Military Air Preservation Society) at the
          Akron Canton airport. I'll send (separately) to you a picture of
          me addressing a group in front of the plane a couple of months
          ago. Thanks again for your remarkable site. Harry Guinther"

   HARRY GUINTHER Obituary - Cleveland, OH | The Plain Dealer
   Harry Guinther (first post to B26.com) of Chagrin Falls, died
          peacefully October 27. 2017. He was 94. Harry was preceded in
          death by Virginia (Kajawa), his wife of 69 years. He is survived
          by sons, David (Barbara); and John (Lisa); grandchildren, Sarah,
          Hannah, Andrews, and two great-grandchildren. An avid sailor,
          golfer, and bridge player, Harry also piloted his own plane in
          his earlier years. He played harmonica, wrote stories and poems,
          and was a tremendous cook. Harry and Virginia traveled to over
          60 countries and every state in the U.S. He also served in the
          Arm Air Corps as a gunner during WWII. On his 56th bombing
          mission, his plane was shot down over France. He was captured
          spending a year as a German P.O.W. before escaping (Maisons
          Laffitte Railroad Bridge). Very active in Veteran affairs, Harry
          gave numerous presentations to schools and organizations on his
          WWII experiences. Harry's career began as a salesman for the
          Richman Brothers Co. retiring in 1986 as President and CEO.
          Harry was a loving husband, father, and friend to many. He will
          be missed. Harry will be interred at Western Reserve National
          Cemetery where he will receive military honors. A memorial
          service will be held Friday, December 1, at 4:30 p.m. at
          Federated Church in Chagrin Falls, Ohio.


   This is the oral history of World War II Veteran Harry P. Guinther
   "There was other activity around and it was obviously the fact that my
          other two crew members were going through the same kind of
          experience I was but the two men who captured me put me in a
          Jeep and drove me away. And they drove me to, I found out later,
          the town that we had just bombed and drove me into a central
          square in the town and the air was filled with dust and smoke.
          There were houses burning around us. I found out also later that
          we had hit the bridge, however, unfortunately just before we hit
          the bridge a train had pulled into the station which was located
          directly on the edge of the river, and it also was hit and
          destroyed and more than 400 people were killed. And the people
          of the town, although they were our allies, they were French,
          some of them were collaborators with the Germans, and although I
          was handcuffed they stood me in the center of that square and a
          number of young Frenchmen begin to beat me up. And did a pretty
          good job of it until the Germans stepped in between them,
          between they and me, and finally turned their guns on the
          Frenchmen and told them to get away and then they put me in the
          back of the Jeep and I was bleeding pretty badly from being, you
          know, split lip and a bloody nose, and so forth. And put me in
          the Jeep and started to drive me in towards Paris. I will always
          look back on that beating that I took at the hands of the
          Frenchmen with some the degree of disappointment and sadness
          because I was risking my life to help these people free
          themselves from the occupying Germans and here they did this to
          me. However, I found out later, as a matter of fact, only a
          couple of years ago when I visited the town that the people were
          very, very grateful of what the American forces did in
          liberating their country and in fact, the -- one of the -- the
          town, one of the town's historians took me to their local museum
          where they have in the museum a picture of our crew and a model
          of our airplane and the story of the raid that day and
          surrounded by both American and French flags in a place of honor
          in the museum."

   In the news: Essex field dug up as US military search for WW2 airman's
          remains


   The aircraft crashed as stated on June 4th 1944 shortly after take-off
          - the aircraft was 42-95814 K9-T 'Susanne' of the 494th BS/344th
          BG based at Stansted.
          The crew was:
          1/Lt John V Pulka Pilot
          2/Lt George E Lyons Co-Pilot
          S/Sgt John A Strauss Togglier
          S/Sgt G L Blosser Radio/Gunner
          S/Sgt H G Mooney Engineer/Gunner
          S/Sgt Boyd Pauling Gunner
          Four crewman escaped whilst two were killed, one of whom was
          recovered at the time with one man who remained MIA.
          Unlike the RAF the US has a unit based in Hawaii whose task is
          to locate missing personnel and try to recover remains, we have
          no such organisation and disturbing wreck sites that may contain
          human remains are not allowed. There was case, a few years ago,
          of a Battle of Britain Hurricane that was lost off a harbour
          wall in Kent, the site was to be redeveloped and the family of
          the pilot asked if the wreck could be recovered so they could
          retrieve any remains and give him a proper burial. Sadly even
          this case was denied! I think that it is unbelievably
          insensitive of the authorities.
          Hope that helps,
          Alan Crouchman

   It has been brought to my attention just now that Mr. Joseph D. Lazar
          passed away last month. I had the honor and privilege of
          chatting with Joe quite a few times over the years. I consider
          myself lucky and fortunate that he returned my email and phone
          calls. I talked with him about the Great Depression, WW2 and
          people who posted to the guestbook. Joe liked the b26 website
          and loved his family and grandchildren, great-grandchildren very
          much. My sincere condolences to the Lazar Family. -Mike

   My name is Darryl Jones and as a part time genealogist I was
          researching my granddaughter-in-law's family when I noticed that
          both her grandfather and great grandfather served in WW II. Her
          grandfather was Wilford Russel Oney who piloted 65 missions in
          B-26 Marauders with the 597th BS, 397 BG.
          Marauderman's Name: Wilford Russel Oney
          Bomb Group: 397th
          Bomb Squadron: 597th
          Years in service:1941-42; 1942-45
          Graduation Class: WC 43-F
          Class Location: Stockton/Santa Ana CA
          Comments: He enlisted as US Army Private 23 Jul 1941 @ Kansas
          City, MO; went to 4th Weather Squadron; accepted Aviation Cadet
          rank 15 Sep 1942; honorably discharged and accepted a commission
          as 2nd Lt on 22 Jun 1943, following his graduation with WC 43-F
          class at Santa Ana, CA; went thru Student Officer-B 26
          Transition Training @ Del Rio, TX; joined 478th BS, 336th BG,
          Marauder RTU training Avon Park, FL & Lake Charles, LA; arrived
          @ Rivenhall, England 22 Apr 1944; promoted to 1st Lt, 17 Jul
          1944; flew 65 combat missions and departed for US 28 Feb 1945;
          received Air Medal w/12 Oak Leaf Clusters; ended active duty 14
          Jul 1945 at Fort Leavenworth, KS; graduated from MIT with a BS
          degree in Electric Power; died 7 Aug 2010 at Schenectady, New
          York.
          I requested and received archive records covering his training
          and discharge (128 pages, only slightly burned), but would like
          to know the aircraft number(s) and name(s); crew members names;
          particulars regarding the aircraft accident occurring on or
          about 13 Aug 1944; any particularly successful bombing runs in
          which he participated.
          Wilford's father, Fred Lee Oney was a railway telegrapher and I
          presume did that type of work for the Army during the war. I
          have requested his archive records but haven't yet received
          them. Does anyone know how many father and son combinations
          served in WWII? I am awaiting family photos of both.

   Hello, I just found your great website for the first time. My father
          was Corp. Leonard G. Robinson crew member of the "Dixie". They
          were part of the first mission flown by the B26 on April 5, 1942
          from Garbutt Field. The Dixie had to land on the main street of
          Townsville when arriving for the first time in March, 1942. I
          have more information that I found years ago on a website called
          Pacific Wrecks, along with photos of the crew, planes etc at the
          airfield. Their team went to the wreckage site of the Dixie and
          posted more photos. I have also uncovered an actual video of the
          Dixie taxiing at Garbutt with my father on the fuselage. -Mark
          Robinson

          a storm over Owen Stanley mountains bellylanded in swampy area
          inland from Salamaua New Guinea.

   My uncle, George Beaman, was a crew chief on the B-26 named "Sweet
          Sue". He began in N. Africa, went to Sicily, through Europe, and
          ended in England. The plane had flown 99 missions, but crashed
          on takeoff in England on the 100th mission. All aboard were
          killed. Uncle George happened to be on the ground that day and
          survived. He was awarded a Purple Heart. -Dan Beaman

   Mr. Allen,
          Thanks for all that you are doing to preserve the history of the
          men and machines of the B-26. My father, Vincent Galvin, from
          Boston, Massachusetts was a turret gunner in one over Europe, I
          believe in the 323 bomb group, 453 squadron, 9th AF.
          For your files I thought the attached information may be useful
          for others conducting research. It is a list of his missions -
          the target city, date, comments, plane number and name and the
          last name of the pilot.
          I hope this is helpful. Thank you.


   Matthew and Kathy Galvin

   Mathew,


   Your father T/Sgt Vincent Galvin flew those 11 combat mission out of
          A-83, Denain/Prouvy in northern France. Below is a list of his
          crewmembers.
          Pilot 1st Lt. Charles R. Dawson
          Copilot 2nd Lt. William J. Curnane
          Bombardier 2nd Lt. R J. Schuenke
          Flight Engineer S/Sgt. George E. Waddell Jr.
          Radioman Sgt. Harold M. Devlin
          Tail Gunner T/Sgt. Vincent Galvin
          Although the mission loading lists show your father as being the
          tail gunner it, was not unusual for the gunners to sometimes
          swap positions for different reasons. The 323rd BG flew its last
          combat mission on April 25, 1945. After that it was tasked with
          disarming different factions of the German military. That would
          probably account for your dad�s stationing in Holland. The later
          replacement crews would remain in Europe until they accrued
          enough points to be rotated back to the States and be discharged

          I am trying to find information of any kind about my
          grandfather. His name was Walter C. Mills, but went by Dub.  He
          did not speak of his wartime experience until the end the last
          10(ish) years of his life. He was so proud to be a Marauder Man.
          I know he trained/ served with Maurice O�Reilly (Pilot). I would
          love any information or guidance in finding information.
          Proud Granddaughter of my Marauder Man, Dub Mills

   Good Day, I hope this e-mail finds you well, my name is Bob Driscoll. I
          am President of Aero Arces Civic Improvement Association, a
          small community in Middle River Md. 21220. We are about 2 -3rds
          of a mile from The Martins Co. of Middle River. Our small but
          proud community of Aero Acres was built to house Martin aircraft
          workers during W.W. 2 , We have a community "Gateway" sign with
          a B26 on it and would like (if you will ) to contact us with any
          info you may have on the plane the tail number is : 334396 . We
          are having the sign replaced with a new more modern one of the
          same exact features, and we were just wondering about the
          "Heroes " that flew this plane. Many Thanks for any info you can
          provide. Bob Driscoll

   Marauderman's Name: Neil C. Davis
          Bomb Group: 386th
          Bomb Squadron: 554th


   While we flew many missions, I have only described a few significant
          ones. We as a crew worked diligently to strike our targets with
          a minimum loss of personnel. While the lead plane was the aiming
          point for the German gun crews on the ground we made it through
          without a wounded crew member or critical damage to the plane.
          We did however get many, many flak holes. "Little Butch" did her
          job and we were grateful. -NEIL C. DAVIS

   D-Day 75th anniversary: Whatlington man honours American airmen who
          died 750ft from his house


   A Whatlington has man built a display outside his house to honour five
          American airmen and six crew members who died in a plane crash
          that landed in Ashburnham Park on D-Day, June 6, 1944.
          [John%20Gerken%20with%20his%20memorial%20sign.jpg]
          John Gerken, who is 84, said he designed the one-day display to
          let local people � who may not be aware of what happened there
          on D-Day morning � know how dreadful it must have been in the
          field behind the houses on the east side of Whatlington Road.
          His sign reads: �On this day 75 years ago five American airmen
          lost their lives within 750 ft of this spot. Their Martin
          Marauder B26 Bomber iced up and collided with another B26 which
          crashed in Ashburnham Park with the loss of all six crew. Please
          remember them all.
          �The Battle Marauder Crew that died were all put into body bags
          and brought through the side way of �Longbranch� (opposite here)
          where they lay on the verge waiting to be taken away by the
          military. It must have been a devastating scene.�
          Mr Gerken�s sign also includes the names of all those who lost
          their lives at that spot 75 years ago today (June 6).
          He added: �My own thoughts with this anniversary coming soon was
          to make a one-day display to try and let local people, who may
          not be aware of what happened here on D-Day morning, know how
          dreadful it must have been in the field behind the houses on the
          east side of Whatlington Road (between Virgins Lane and Oakhurst
          Road. This stretch was known as �The Levels�).
          �The British Legion (Battle branch) had a very nice wooden
          memorial to both crews, which was consecrated by the Dean of
          Battle in 2007. �However, this is now located elsewhere � I was
          told in the American Embassy.
          �A lot of people have recorded details in the past about this
          and some aircraft parts recovered from both sites can be seen at
          the Robertsbridge Aviation Society�s Museum at Bush Barn on the
          A21, but there is no memorial to the American airmen that died
          here in Battle now.�

   Good Morning,
          I am including some information about my father who was a
          Marauder man in WWII. I thought that I would share it as a
          remembrance of him on this 75th anniversary of D-Day.
          Thank-you, Rich Erickson
          Thank-you to the Marauder Men who are still with us for your
          incredible bravery, skill, and determination while flying your
          missions over Europe � especially on this seventy-fifth
          anniversary of D-Day. God bless the memories of those Marauder
          Men who have passed away over these past seventy-five years.
          My father, Clarence V. Erickson, was one of you. He passed away
          in 1972 and never really said much about his time in the
          service. Brokaw�s book, the Greatest Generation, started the
          conversations that helped to enlighten future generations about
          the unselfish service you, The Marauder Men, provided to the
          country.
          We have found various items stored away in his storage box that
          record his bombing runs on June 6, 1944. There are two entries
          for 6/6/44. The first one lists the Make of aircraft as a
          B-26/B45 at 2000HP. The from location is listed as C which I am
          guessing is Matching Green. In the To column of his log are the
          words Sortie#39 and he has Co-Pilot flight time 2hrs 50mns. The
          second entry for 6/6/44 lists the same plane, same from location
          � C, and Sortie#40, with Co-Pilot 3hrs 25mns. There is also a
          small Penworthy Note Book in the locker and there are only two
          pages with anything on them. The top line on the first page has
          the penciled words � Bombing Missions. He then has drawn bomb
          representations on that and the second page. The last two bomb
          sketches on the first page have D-Day penciled under them.
          Thank-you to all of the Marauder Men and to all of the men and
          women who so honorably served in the Armed Services in WWII.
          Rich Erickson son of Marauder Man Clarence V. Erickson � 391st

   The details have dimmed with time, so it is impossible to know what
          altitude the Marauder crews were told to fly over Utah Beach on
          the northern coast of France. Cornelius Ryan of the London Daily
          Telegraph was sitting in the prefabricated metal hut where the
          officers of the 386th Bomb Group were briefed. �You may have to
          bomb as high as 12,000 feet or lower than 1,000 feet,� he quoted
          the group commander as saying. �The cloud height will determine
          this.� By Daniel Ford

   In commemoration of the upcoming 75th anniversary of D-Day, and in
          recognition of the contributions made by Marauder Men in support
          of the Allied invasion, attached are two photos taken over the
          Normandy beaches by Lt. Bill Rose, B26 bombardier, 573rd Bomb
          Squadron, 391st Bomb Group, 9th AF, based at RAF Matching
          northeast of London. Like many members of the �greatest
          generation�, he never spoke of any of this. We found these
          photos after his passing several years ago. More of his photos
          are posted on his dedication page on this website. Thanks for
          keeping these memories alive! Mac

   I would like to set up a dedication page for my father, Paul V.
          Parkosewich, who was a Bombardier/Navigator on a B-26 during
          WW2. He finished 40 missions and returned for a full life until
          he passed away in 2014. I have several photos and a brief
          history that I would like to email to you if that would be OK.
          Another member of his crew -Paul Ellzey- also has a dedication
          page on the site and stands with him in front of their
          B-26-SKEETER. My father is the first man on left top row. -Paul

   Hello,
          I am trying to find a navigator who served in Vietnam with my
          father, Edward S. Bridges. My mother believes he retired as a
          full Colonel. If there are any known whereabouts of C/C SSGT
          Enoch Hayes, we�d like to know how to connect with him also.
          My father was Capt. Richard D. Goss, USAF. He was KIA in an A-1E
          on August 29, 1964 at Bien Hoa from hostile action. He was a
          member of the 1ST AIR COMMANDO SQDN, 34TH TAC GROUP at the time.
          In early 1964, my father and Capt. Bridges with SSGT Hayes flew
          the last B-26 out of Vietnam to Clarke AFB (I believe that was
          the destination.) I�ve attached a couple photos documenting this
          fact.
          A third photo is of the 1st Air Commando Sqdn that a friend
          provided � his father, Major William Cordero, was KIA soon after
          my father in B-52. Major is in the front row, 5th from the
          right. My father is absent, probably off flying.
          If you can put me in touch with anyone who may know the
          whereabouts of Col. Bridges or SSGT Hayes. And anyone else who
          may have served with my father. He was also based at Hamilton
          AFB where my little brother was born. My mother returned home to
          Seattle when he volunteered for the last time to return to
          Vietnam, after training on the A-1E.
          Thank you so much, and thank you for your service. I�m grateful
          for this link and opportunity to connect with our country�s
          heroes.
          Best,
          Laura Goss McCloud Mathers

   My name is Philippe Vernimmen, from Belgium.
          I discovered the B26 website recently, making research on an
          original WWII painted leather flying jacket that I came across
          lately.
          One of the post on the website matches the name and some details
          written/painted on that jacket.
          It is from Joe Salomon, grandson of a pilot named Lt Leo Savage
          "Gene".
          That post is dated from 12/9/07.
          If anyone can pass my message to Joe Salomon, maybe, 10 years
          later, I can answer some of that person's questions.
          Regards,
          Philippe Vernimmen

   Max Petrisek, 94, of Millersville, took his final flight on Thursday
          morning, April 11, 2019 at LGH. He was married to the late
          Margaret R. (Letavic) Petrisek for 65 years prior to her death
          in 2011.


   This one sentence sums up what a great person Max was "He never met a
          person who couldn't teach him something." ... that's Max! Max's
          last post 1/5/19; and his obituary. RIP buddy.
          Max's first contact to the site in 2005:

   To who asked the question & requested a response to 2/9/05 entry. "Why
          so many early B26 accidents & should it be called the "flying
          Prostitute?". What the B26 should be called will not change by
          more careful evaluation- the name will and should "stick" as it
          was as stated. As a copilot, pilot, flight leader & combat
          command pilot I might contribute to reasons for accidents or the
          reputation. The question partly answers itself as it was
          "questions of the early days of the planes history. The B26 was
          put into service at a faster than normal pace, few instructor
          pilots thus all learned as we went along. The modifications were
          helpful especially adding wingspan and engine power. As of about
          the beginning of '44 the supposed pilot apprehension, the
          modifications, learning curve and the integration of machine &
          man progressed at a fast rate. Sure there was a need and effort
          to quickly get crews & new planes into combat posture. There
          were few problems with pilots or B26 after this period. Those of
          us that flew the B26 as well as those that maintained or had any
          "part of the chain" were confident and delighted to have such a
          reliable plane. This feeling of exceptional performance became
          reinforced for anyone that came back safely with a shot up
          plane. No complaints, no mysteries, not one specific "FAULT"
          about the progression of the B26 or anyone who had a part in
          it's excellent performance. Just a commitment and a job well
          done. This is about 60 years later but the conviction remains.
          Just remembered that before going overseas I flew B26 pulling
          tow targets for B26 gunners practice over Tampa Bay. Didn't see
          any prostitutes or anyone going into the Bay in late '43. Nobody
          was even complaining, it was part of some serious preparation
          for what was to be done. No more."

   Hello everybody,
          I am also German researcher of airwar during WW II around my
          hometown Legden. Legden is located in the northwestern part of
          Germany approx. 20km east off the Dutch border. On 22 Feb 1945
          Marauder 43-34410 crashed in the vicinity after being hit by Me
          109's. All baled out safely. We know the area where the plane
          went down and we'll search the site in this summer. Is there any
          crew picture or one of the plane?
          Kind regards,
          Martin

   Hello!
          I am on the Board of Directors of a Marauder organization. I was
          given a project last winter to identify all B-26 crew members
          who were POWs and escape and evaders. I spent over 600 hrs
          wading through 145,000 American POWs to find them. I also found
          B-26 POWs from the British, French, and South African Air
          forces.
          I wanted to seek your permission to link your website to my
          searchable B26pows.com website.
          I wanted to see how we might be able to help each other get the
          word out there about the Marauder men. My dad Stanley S Bolesta
          was a bombardier navigator on "Duchess of Barksdale" 322nd
          449th.He was shot down on Nov 3 1943 and was taken prisoner. He
          evaded 5 weeks before he was caught. You can find out about him
          by just typing Bolesta in the search field and you will find
          info about my dad
          He flew a mission in Flak- Bait on Sept 5, 1943. I built a RC
          model airplane - hope to maiden it within the next month ...
          weather depending. See video
          I also built a B-26 of my dad's plane. See video
          Hope we can connect with each other. You can either email me or
          call my cell 484-678-8505

   Hi, this message is for Alan, I hope you receive this.
          Alan, my name is Jon Kamp. I'm a journalist with the Wall Street
          Journal in Boston, Massachusetts. I'm writing for both personal
          and professional reasons, as I was thinking about writing an
          article about a B-26 mission on June 8, 1944. You have written
          about the same, a mission piloted by Rollin Childress two days
          after D-day, to hit a German fuel dump in France. Only four
          planes made it to target in terrible weather, one of which was
          shot down, and the men on the lead plane were awarded for the
          successful mission.
          My Grandfather, Howard Weingrow, was the radio operator/gunner
          on that flight, his third of 65 missions on Marauders in the
          war. He flew out of Chipping Ongar before they moved to forward
          bases in France. I recall him telling me there were English kids
          near the base who loved to watch the planes coming and going,
          and whom he and other American airmen befriended. I'm wondering
          if you ever touched base with my grandfather later in his life.
          He died two years ago at age 94. Several years before he died he
          gave me his detailed journals from the war, including a mission
          log with information on every flight, his crews, targets, etc.
          Up until then I didn't know he had so carefully recorded
          everything.
          I would love to speak with you sometime soon to compare notes,
          and to see if you happen to know who the other men were on that
          June 8th flight. I have the nicknames or last names for that
          entire crew so I bet we can figure it out. I'd like to track
          down what happened to each and every one of them.
          You can email me here at your convenience. Thanks so much.
          Jon Kamp

   Hello,
          I am trying to reach and find/gather/provide information that
          may allow me to gain more I sight on what to do with some of my
          grandfathers belongings. He was a Lt. Col in the Air Force. I
          have been going through a lot of things this weekend and don�t
          really know where to �start�.
          He flew B-26 on WWII, Korean, and Vietnam wars. One plane spoken
          about with quite a few pictures is Pops Wagon. 1941ish - not
          sure. I have these dates in the material i have, I just need to
          go through them more throughly.
          I want to reach out and see if anyone has
          thoughts/suggestions/insight on how I can go further with
          gaining or sharing information about my grandfathers military
          career.
          Please, reach out to me! I would love to go further with this
          journey I am on...information and knowledge.
          I will be going through stuff during the week, and writing more
          precise information down ...and would love to be able to share
          further.
          Thank you in advance,

   Hi Trevor,
          I hope you can help me. I will be in Essex, England and will be
          visiting Normandy in 30 days.
          I would like to visit where my Dad flew out of England, but I'm
          not sure where he was stationed.
          The B-26 is numbered 1829 and the crew consisted of :
          "Pappy" Crims - Pilot
          "Bink" - Co-Pilot
          Bob "Rollike" "Rolantz - Bombardier
          Harold "Mac" McFeeters - Radio Operator and Waist Gunner
          Tail Gunner - unknown
          Mac was my father.
          Bob Rolantz ended up being an executive at Atlantic Record
          company and he wrote a memoir of which I have a copy. I would
          like to publish it and send it to families of the crew members,
          but I don't know how to reach them.
          Any information you can provide would be very much appreciated.
          Photos of the crew would be awesome.
          Thanks for your help.

   Dear Sir/Madame,
          I have been on a project offshore recently and have found a
          piece of B26 wreckage. Please treat this report as confidential
          as the project has strict guidelines on information transfer. I
          have forwarded the piece of wreckage to the USAF in Holland and
          they thanked us for our efforts to identify the piece. I attach
          a file I compiled which will explain everything I hope. The
          piece I have been told is to be repatriated to the USA. I trust
          this will be done. Some of the information I found to enable an
          identification came from your site. I hope there is still
          someone out there who knows these brave men.
          Please don't hesitate to contact me.
          Yours sincerely
          Ryan Shern


   Ryan,
          We have 4 B-26's attacked at map reference 51 degrees 05 minutes
          N & 03 degrees 05 minutes E unfortunately this does not give us
          the map reference where each B-26 crashed into the sea. Knowing
          the forward speed is essential and the sequence each aircraft
          was actually falling. The spread of sea bed debris would b e
          considerable and this presents a formidable problem. Unless you
          have more detailed information we can not determine the exact
          B-26 the debris you have is from. Additionally the only way a
          positive identification could be arrived at is if human remains
          have been found with dog tags.
          I am sorry that my reply is un-conclusive but is there is any
          evidence to take this search further I would be delighted to
          assist your efforts

   I�m looking for some information regarding my Dad, T/SGT Thomas G
          Harmes (Harmes, Thomas E. (armorer-tail gunner, 35 missions,
          Stud Duck) 34BS, 17BG � 7/25/03.
          He was severely wounded on Dec 24, 1944 on a mission to Singen
          Railroad Bridge, Germany. He was 19. He was not with his regular
          crew having volunteered to be the tail gunner for the run. I�m
          looking for any information on this mission and hope that there
          may be a mission report available. I do not know the name of the
          plane he was on when wounded. However I recently found a letter
          that suggest the plane tail number was 35.
          Any information or sources you could provide regarding the
          mission or #35 would be most appreciated. Dad spoke fondly of
          the Stud Duck (Lasly) crew but he provided little information of
          the mission or the crew he flew with when wounded.
          Thank you, Tom Harmes
          The Thunderbird Goes to War on page 163 provides the following
          information�.


   Tom,
          The 17th Bomb Group records are to say the least incomplete and
          not every incident is listed.
          On December 24th 1944 three B-26'a were shot down by flak and
          fighters and Thomas was not on any one of those planes. I have
          no record of which planes crash landed on that date, hence no
          record of your father.
          Regards
          Trevor Allen

   Well please know that I really appreciate the efforts that you all have
          expended on my behalf. I�m afraid I may not be able complete my
          goal to document the circumstances of my Dad�s last mission. I
          have just a couple more leads that I would like to share with
          you�. I have a few (3) specific questions below:
          I do know that the plane he volunteered to fly on returned to
          the Dijon airfield with damage it did not crash. His left leg
          was amputated at the base field hospital on Christmas Day 1944.
          He eventually ended up at the hosp in Battle Creek MI for
          several months.
          ---
          Vic Tannehill in his book The Daddy of Them All, story of the
          17th Bomb Group in WWII, advises page 62:
          On December 24 (1944) the mission was FUBAR. Very aggressive
          Me-109s jumped the 17th�s formation of 32 Marauders on their way
          to bomb Singen railroad bridge. Three 37th Squadron B26s were
          lost to the fighters. One was seen to crash after two chutes
          were observed (#35 This Is It); the second was last seen in a
          spin and smoking, no chutes (#42 Teton Special); and the third
          (#45 Ramblin� Wreck) was going down under attack by four of the
          Messerschmitts.
          The Thunderbird Goes to War (page 163) provides a similar
          account of the mission (snafued), noting that the 34th BS
          provided 10 aircraft to the mission. There is no mention of any
          lost B26s from the 34th.
          As an aside Dad told me that the mission was led by CO Maj.
          Magdich he was blamed for the failure of the mission and the
          loss of life and injury. He advised there were threats made to
          Maj. Magdich.
          On page 163 it is noted that on December 26 1944: Major Magdich
          has been relieved of his command and transferred to XII Tactical
          Air Command.
          So here are a couple of questions:
          1) Regarding tail numbers; were the numbers unique to the Bomb
          Group or were they unique to a Bomb Squad? As I�ve noted I had
          some information that Dad was on #35 on the mission. So if there
          was a #35 37th BS could there have also been a #35 34th BS?
          2) Were any field hospital records saved? I plan to start
          looking for any info regarding his 7 month stay the hosp in
          Battle Creek. Would there have been records from the field hosp
          in Dijon?
          3) Is there any paperwork trail related to Maj Magdich that
          might advise the reason for his abrupt transfer after the failed
          mission?
          As noted previously sincere thanks to everyone helping me with
          this�..
          Best Regards Tom

   Afternoon Trevor,
          Is there any way of getting contact with Arthur EW Thornton, son
          of Arthur Edmund Thornton who posted 5.03pm on 1/8/09. The
          father was a navigator on a C47 in 1944 before joining a bombing
          unit. His C47 served on D-Day and is being restored to fly and
          due to fly this summer for the 75th Anniversary.
          Please let me know.
          Regards
          Mark Sheppard

   Hello Trevor,
          First of all, thank you for this beautiful site that allows us
          to find a lot of information to help us to commemorate American
          airmen who fought in France and died for some.
          Currently, I am in the process of searching for additional
          documents and photo for the B26 (42-96113 4T-J) and its crew who
          fell near my home on August 7, 1944. (Maj Clinton M.lee; 2 Lt
          Richard H Parsons, Capt Bjarne C Tangen, Lt. Arthur E Thornton,
          S / Sgt Albert H Kahler, Sgt Frank J Drapola, S / Sgt Donald W
          Short, Sgt John Waite, Jr.
          We started prospecting in the field and we found pieces of
          aircraft including a plate owned by John Waite Jr. We would also
          like to find the family to John Waite to give this plate.
          I'm also looking for information on the two B26 planes and their
          crews that fell on the same day (42-96221 IHLE Donald Driver and
          42-96224 LOWELL Benjamin Pilot)
          For our historic center, I wish to write an article not paid.
          You give me permission to use your information to complete those
          I have. If you want, I could also give you all the information
          on the place of the fall, the local history by the people who
          saw the plane fall, the pieces found ...
          Thank you
          Best regards,
          Patrick Bossard

   Good Afternoon,
          I am Raymond M. Vargo Jr., son of Raymond M. Vargo. I see that
          you have some information on my father on your B26.com website,
          but I would like to add some additional information.
          My father was a member of 574th BS, 391 BG
          He was a Radio Operator/Gunner
          He flew 24 combat missions
          He passed away on February 12, 2011
          Thank you very much for remembering and documenting our loved
          ones and heroes.

   I found two pictures which might be in your interest. Both pictures
          were taken around march 25 1945 at Venlo Airport The
          Netherlands. In the house where my mother ( then 18 years old
          )lived were several American soldiers. One of them was b26 pilot
          Westley E. Shook (last address 1850 Sierra Madre drive Atwater
          Ca.) We visited him in 1998. I don�t know the name of the pilot
          in front of his plane �Round Too�. My mother mentioned a name
          Bill Quinliven or something like that. Perhaps it is the pilot
          on the picture???

   My deceased uncle, George Frederick Moser, was a B-26 pilot during WWII
          in Europe. My mother, also deceased, who was his sister once
          told me that his squadron insignia was a "Thumbs Up." Based on
          that information I came to the conclusion that he served with
          the 453rd Squadron of the 323rd Bomb Group. However, when I
          obtained ten CD from the AFHRA with data on that group my
          uncle's name does not appear despite many detailed crew lists
          for various missions. It is possible that I misunderstood the
          reference to "Thumbs Up" and I searched the wrong group. It is
          also possible that he was with the unit during the period that
          statistical mission data is recorded, but the full crew lists
          are missing.
          I did discover from other sources online that B-26 41-31621 with
          the 554th Squadron of the 386th Bomb Group was named "Thumbs
          Up". This aircraft, however, was assigned to Lt. Arthur M. Lien
          and nothing has turned up that would connect my uncle with it.
          Could there have been other aircraft in other B-26 groups named
          "Thumbs Up" ? Not sure how to proceed with tracking down the
          correct bomb group. The search is complicated by the fact that
          his service number is not known to me and I do not know if any
          living members related to my mother's side of the family have
          it. The fire in St. Louis does not help. I do know that George
          Frederick Moser was in the Air Force during the Korean War
          period and later flew F-84's for the Ohio Air National Guard. I
          actually knew him as Uncle Fred while other people knew him as
          George.
          It might be necessary for me to search through every B-26 group
          starting with the 8 in the European Theatre and then expanding
          to the 3 in the MTO if nothing found before then.

   Has an index of names for Accident Reports and Missing Air Crew Reports
          (MACR) been compiled?
          I am looking for a Sergeant Spangler who was my first cousin
          The roster does not list any named Spangler
          http://320thbg.org/320th_roster.html
          However, I found three listings in the monthly reports �War
          Diary� for Sgt Spangler in the 442nd Bomb Squadron of the 320th
          Bomb Group.
          Therefore the roster is not complete.
          If everyone visiting the Accident Reports and Missing Air Crew
          Reports (MACR), filled in a standard template listing name,
          rank, Sqdn Number, report number, etc. it would not take long to
          create an index with just a little computer work to combine the
          templates. That index could then be added to the roster file
          mentioned above.
          I would like to discuss this with your computer resource
          contact.

   As a Marauder Guy I have read the B26 postings many times & posted a
   few times. I flew 63 missions in the European Theater, 95 Sqd. 17th AF.
   I feel good about our contributions to the greatest war of all times.
   Now at the age of almost 95 I am more moved by the events of the WW2
   Marauder days now than I seemed to be then. We were happy civilian kids
   that were soon to become GI warriors. Most of us wanted to get into
   combat and then return HOME with our buddies! The GI training was
   vigorous but not knowing when the war would end was gnawing at our
   minds. You became adapted to loosing buddies. The Nazi prepared for
   decades & became very formidable committed enemy warriors. The biggest
   threat to us in combat was the millions of 88mm AA flack. Like being
   the pigeon in a long pigeon shoot-out. I never saw anyone that wavered
   during combat or didn't give their best! Made it but lost half of my
   crew and many other buddies. Now descendents still appropriately seek
   info about their lost loved ones and many more morn their early
   passing. The search for info should continue. My dear buddies you are
   forever in my heart. The B26 site helps us commemorate and yet endure
   our losses. Visiting resting sites and funerals of my buddies was the
   best I could do to keep bonded to my buddies. Peace, Max Petrisek

   Good morning,
          Do you have any more information on the plane "Mitch's Bitch"?
          Pardon the expletive. This was my great uncle's B-26 that he was
          assigned to. I know that it crashed, and that he survived, but
          is there any more information you have access to? Thanks!
