   Sprinkle aprons and rainbow aprons are here, y’all!!! *Throws sprinkles
   in the air* (*Gets money’s worth out of the Roomba*) I’ve been scheming
   with my fronds at Enrich and Endure about this for what seems like
   forever, so I am extra super duper excited that they are finally here!
   I first became obsessed with Enrich and Endure four years ago when I
   got the sweetest note from the co-owner, Sarah, asking if she could
   send me an apron. When it arrived, I immediately fell in love with the
   quality, the color, and the feel, and it became part of my permanent
   uniform. It was too beautiful to think of as just a utilitarian kitchen
   linen, it was more than that, more like a well-loved dress or
   something! Over the years I’ve collected more and more colors to add to
   my wardrobe and they now take up like half of my closet. I wear them
   frequently on Girl Meets Farm, at events, on this here little blog, and
   anytime I’m making a mess which is pretty much always. Whenever I think
   up outfits to wear for blog posts and the show, my aprons play a
   central role. So when Sarah and her brother and co-owner Lorcan,
   brought up the idea of collaborating I obviously said yasssss. I’m not
   a clothes designer but I know that I like sprinkles and rainbows (did
   you know I like sprinkles and rainbows? :-P) so we immediately knew
   that one of the aprons had to have sprinkles. Aoife Scott designed the
   perfect pile of sprinkles to hang out subtly on the shoulder and pocket
   of an oatmeal crossback apron. This one is elegant and soft spoken with
   just a dash of whimsy and color, and it’s sooo comfy. No waistband =
   you can eat more dumplings.

   For the other apron, we wanted to go with their classic apron shape, it
   is SO flattering! Sarah and Lorcan sent me a bunch of swatches of their
   linen to choose some colors and they were all SO PRETTY that I couldn’t
   decide, so I chose them all and named her rainbow. Ms. Rainbow is loud
   and spunky!! The overlapping pocket is inspired by this cool sweatshirt
   and it’s the perfect size for lip balm, sprinkle tweezers, a tiny tube
   of harissa, etc. I also love that the two straps are different colors
   so they look like a puzzle when they’re tied.

   These are all made in Ireland with gorgeous high quality Irish linen
   and I know you guys are going to love them!!! They would make perfect
   gifts for the holidays!!! Buy the rainbow apron here and buy the
   sprinkle apron here, and hurry because quantities are limited! I’ll
   also be posting a giveaway on my Instagram soon :)

   Enjoy, fronds!!!!

   Hotdish : My Upper Midwest Fronds :: Kugel : Me.

   [Hotdish is to my upper Midwest fronds as kugel is to me.]

   Not in the way that kugel was a dish that we ate on a regular basis for
   dinner growing up, but rather in the way that I just assumed that
   everybody grew up with it and took a nostalgic comfort in it. Like I
   literally thought that everyone knew kugel until last year, when Alana
   talked to me about her first experience about it. I was in shock that
   she’d never had it! It’s like a… sweet mac and cheese? It was…
   interesting! But in a good way! And then I met a dozen more people with
   the same reaction at the Fargo Hotdish Festival when Bernbaum’s brought
   an amazing kugel to compete with tater tot hotdishes of all sorts. It
   dawned on me then that not everyone knows this dish that was so central
   to my childhood holidays and I suddenly had to figure out a way to
   explain it and convince my fronds that it totally deserved to be
   classified as a hotdish.

   And seriously, if you bend the definition of a vegetable to mean, well,
   fruit then you’ve got it: the cottage cheese mixture is your sauce, the
   noodles are your starch, the nuts are your protein, and the
   raisins/cherries/apples are your produce. Hotdish. Sold.

   Flavor-wise, think of it as rice pudding made with noodles! And baked!
   Or, ok, a slightly sweet, a teensy bit sour, and kind of soufflé-like
   mac and cheese. And for all of the times I’ve made fun of Eggboy for
   having sweet cookie salad alongside the main course of his meal (as
   opposed to as dessert), I now owe him an apology because kugel, in all
   of its dessert-leaning glory, is part of the main course.

   The kugel that my mom made growing up was based on Emeril’s recipe. It
   was such a great combination of richness and milkiness and it had the
   perfect touch of cinnamon and sugar, as well as a toasty nutty topping.
   It was, and continues to be, the only place that I will eat cottage
   cheese. For some reason it’d been a really really long time since we
   had it at holidays and it wasn’t until the Fargo Hotdish Festival that
   I was reminded of it because Bernbaum’s kugel was so similar. It
   brought me right back to kugel of my youth, but it had the one
   inspiring addition of granny smith apples. I LOVED this addition
   because it added color, crunch, and brightness to an otherwise super
   heavy dish. So I stole the idea. I added it to my family kugel, along
   with some cardamom and a bit of lemon for additional depth of flavor,
   and I fine tuned the sweetness to create the new and improved family
   kugel that Bernie is going to grow up with.

   And it’s of course only fitting that I’m using Our Family goodies to
   make Our Family Kugel! They make it easy to make this recipe since
   their cottage cheese and sour cream comes in big enough tubs that you
   end up using just a whole big tub of each.

   Make this for Rosh Hashanah or it’s also great prepped in advance, so
   make it for Yom Kippur break fast.

   L’Shana Tovah, everyone!

   Noodle Kugel with Cardamom and Apples

   Serves 8

   ingredients

   Kosher salt

   1 lb Our Family wide egg noodles

   6 tb (85g) unsalted butter, divided

   5 large eggs

   1 lb Our Family cottage cheese

   1 lb Our Family sour cream

   3/4 c (150g) sugar

   1 c (236 mL) whole or 2% milk

   2 tsp cinnamon, divided

   1/2 tsp cardamom

   1 tb vanilla extract

   Zest and juice of 1 lemon

   2 granny smith apples, chopped

   2 c (260g) pecans, chopped

   1/2 c (100g) light brown sugar

   clues

   Preheat oven to 350ºf. Grease a 9” x 13” casserole dish or similar
   (pictured is a deep 9” x 9” casserole) and set aside.

   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the egg noodles to
   al dente, about 4-5 minutes. Drain and toss with 4 tablespoons of
   butter.

   In a large bowl, combine the eggs, cottage cheese, sour cream, sugar,
   milk, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla, lemon zest, and 1 1/2
   teaspoons salt. In a small bowl, toss the apples with the lemon juice.
   Fold the noodles and apples into the cottage cheese mixture and then
   transfer to the casserole dish.

   In a small bowl, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and add the
   pecans, brown sugar, remaining teaspoon of cinnamon, and a good pinch
   of salt. Sprinkle it all over the top of the noodles. Bake until set,
   about 1 hour. Let cool slightly and serve.

   To prep it the day before, do everything up until the step where you
   top it with the nuts. Cover and refrigerate. When ready to bake, top it
   with the nuts and bake as directed, but tack on another few minutes to
   the baking time.

Apple and Honey and Marzipan Rolls

   My concept of time right now is all thrown off, I’ve just gotten home
   from celebrating Hanukkah* (and I have the dreidels on my nails to show
   it), summer has decided to come back for a weird unwelcome encore (get
   away!!), and I spent all last week testing Christmas cookie recipes.
   And the tomatoes have finally decided to turn red. Have you ever had a
   tomato and mayonnaise sandwich for lunch followed by a piece of stollen
   for dessert? It’s so weird. I mean, ok, I can’t complain, it’s all good
   things except for the gross 80 degree heat but I am ready to truly
   immerse myself in the upcoming high holidays because I think Rosh
   Hashanah is my preferred new year out of the three new years that we
   do. I just feel like the fact that it happens at the beginning of the
   school year and the start of sweater weather makes it feel way more
   like the dawn of something exciting than the Gregorian New Year (which
   hasn’t really been fun since I was 22 and could drink a Red Bull and
   vodka together) and the Chinese New Year (which is delicious and great
   but January as a month is kinda a drag. And I’m too old to get
   envelopes of money now 🤷🏻‍♀️).

   *We just filmed the Hanukkah Cooking Championship for Food Network! It
   was a dream. I even got kinda emotional over the fact that there is
   actually going to be a Hanukkah show on Food Network!! The food was so
   delicious and the other people on it were the bee’s knees. Whether or
   not you celebrate Hanukkah, you guys are going to lurrrv this show.

   Speaking of celebrating Jewish holidays on the TV (!), this weekend is
   the Rosh Hashanah brunch episode of Girl Meets Farm! Both Stoopie and
   my silly Aunt Cathy came to town to film this episode and it was a
   blast. I cooked brisket with my mom, made a celery cocktail with Aunt
   Cathy, and introduced Bernie to her crazy family. The recipe I’m most
   excited about is these apple butter rolls, which look just like
   cinnamon rolls, but they’re better because they’re topped with honey
   marzipan frosting. If you’ve ever thought omg challah baking in the
   oven is the best smell evarrr, try filling little swirly rolls of
   challah with a very cinnamony apple butter and grated almond paste and,
   wow, your pumpkin spice candle didn’t stand a chance. And then they get
   topped with a frosting made of marzipan butter and honey which is
   thick, glossy, luxurious, parve, and perfect. So you’re checking all of
   the Rosh Hashanah boxes with these rolls: Round challah? Check. Apples?
   Check. Honey? Check. A make-ahead situation? Check check. And marzipan,
   because a few years back I started including marzipan with the apples
   and honey tradition since almonds go so well with both apples and
   honey, and it just decided to stick around. They are so soft and fluffy
   and decadent and good. Exactly the ticket for a sweet New Year!

   Apple and Honey and Marzipan Rolls

   Makes 12 rolls

   ingredients

   1 c (236ml) almond milk, warm (105-110ºf)

   2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast

   1 tsp + 1/4 c (50g) sugar

   4 1/2 c (585g) all-purpose flour

   1 tsp kosher salt

   1 tsp cinnamon

   a pinch of cardamom

   2 large eggs

   1/2 c (100g) flavorless oil

   1/4 c (84g) honey

   1 tsp vanilla


   filling

   3/4 c (204g) apple butter, store-bought or homemade

   1 tsp cinnamon

   6 oz (170g) almond paste, grated on the big holes of a box grater or
   finely chopped

   Eggwash: 1 large egg beaten with a splash of water


   frosting

   1 1/2 c (192g) blanched almonds

   1/4 c (84g) honey

   Zest from 1/2 a lemon

   1/4 tsp kosher salt

   1 tsp almond extract

   6 tb (89ml) almond milk

   Toasted sliced almonds, for topping

   clues

   Combine the milk, yeast, and 1 teaspoon of sugar and swirl together.
   Let sit for 5 minutes, or until foamy on top.

   In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook,
   combine the flour, remaining sugar, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom. In a
   medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, honey, and vanilla. Stir the
   yeast mixture and the oil mixture into the dry mixture and then knead,
   either on a work surface or with the dough hook, adding more flour as
   needed, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, 7-10 minutes.
   Place in an oil bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 1 1/2-2
   hours, or until doubled in size.

   Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and roll it out into a large
   18” x 12” rectangle. Spread it with the apple butter and sprinkle with
   the cinnamon and almond paste. Roll it up tightly the long way, and
   pinch the edges to seal. Cut into 12 rolls and place evenly spaced in a
   9” x 13” baking dish (3 rows of 4). Cover with plastic wrap and
   refrigerate overnight, or let rise at room temperature for another hour
   and then go directly to the baking step.

   When ready to bake, remove the rolls from the refrigerator and let sit
   at room temperature for 1-2 hours, until puffy. Preheat the oven to
   350ºf. Remove the plastic wrap and brush with the egg wash. Bake until
   the rolls are lightly browned; begin checking for doneness at 35
   minutes.

   To make the frosting: Blend the almonds in a food processor, scraping
   the sides occasionally, until creamy and spreadable, about 5-10
   minutes. Add the honey, lemon zest, salt, and almond extract and
   continue to blend (it may clump together at this point up that’s ok) as
   you drizzle in the milk. Blend until creamy. This can be made the day
   before and stored in the fridge.

   When the rolls come out of the oven, spread them with the frosting,
   sprinkle with the almonds and serve.

   We’ve done it, we’ve achieved peak coziness: Bernie and I live in our
   matching fuzzy fleeces, soothing whispery folk tunes play on repeat,
   and in between nap times we pick squash and apples from the garden. I
   never thought I could love the fall more, but of course now it’s one
   thousand million times better with a giggling Bern strapped on to me. I
   try not to think about the fact that in a few short years, this time of
   year will mean that it’s time for her to start school, but what I do
   love thinking about is all of the school supplies and the after school
   snacks that we’re going to enjoy. (I know, I’ve just made my first
   batch of baby food and I’m already thinking about after school snacks?!
   Listen, I already know her full Bat Mitzvah menu, ok? Just let me have
   this.) I’m just so excited because the snack time that I engaged in
   regularly after school growing up was probably my favorite meal of the
   day. I mean, I loved my little breakfast sandwiches that I would eat on
   the ride to school, and lunches in my frog lunchbox were always great
   especially when they involved baloney sandwiches, but nothing ever
   compared to sitting at the kitchen counter, feasting on snacks with a
   big glass of milk, and hanging out with my mom while D.W. got sassy at
   Arthur on the TV in the background. After school snack food was always
   the best food: dumplings, pizza pockets, miniature bagel dogs, cheese
   on toast, and the crown jewel, hot pretzels. I’d have the frozen kind
   that came with a packet of extra coarse salt and I’d microwave them
   with a slice of cheese that got bubbly around the edges. I was never
   patient enough to allow them to cool so that they wouldn’t burn my
   mouth, but they were delicious all the same (and nothing that a sip of
   cold milk wouldn’t fix). It was the best tastiest little break between
   school and marimba practice and I can’t wait to have that break with
   Bern.

   So today I’ve got a new and improved version of my old fave, one that
   I’ll make as soon as Bernie starts school, and one that I make these
   days just to have around for noshing. It uses a kitchen hack that I
   love which is that you can make pretzels from pretty much any fluffy
   bread dough, store-bought or homemade. In a world where I am an octopus
   and can hold Bernie with one set of arms while kneading dough with the
   other set of arms, I would use challah with this. Challah pretzels
   forever. But these days I’ve been using store-bought bread dough which
   works like a charm. In a nod to Jerusalem bagels, these are oval shaped
   and covered in enough sesame seeds to make any basic dough a little bit
   more interesting. You can make a big batch of pretzels and keep them in
   the freezer and reheat them so that they’re hot and ready at a moments
   notice. And they get dipped in a creamy, rich, and surprisingly easy to
   make cheese sauce that’s topped with earthy za’atar and includes
   protein thanks to the real milk and cheese within. It’s soo good and
   filled with nutrients that will keep Bernie going through her after
   school orchestra rehearsal/dance class/hockey practice/horticulture
   club (?) etc. It’s just a simple milk-based sauce that comes together
   in a snap and then melts with mozzarella. I love mild mozzarella with a
   pop of za’atar but, yes, you can use any melty cheese that’s in your
   fridge!

   Sesame Pretzels with Za’atar Mozzarella Sauce

   Makes 8 pretzels

   Pretzel Ingredients

   1 c (230g) baking soda

   2 (11 oz) cans store bought french bread dough (or a batch of homemade
   yeasted bread dough, might I suggest challah dough!)

   2 c (472g) water

   Egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with a splash of water

   Sesame seeds and flaky salt, for topping

   Mozzarella Sauce Ingredients

   2 tb unsalted butter

   2 tb all-purpose flour

   1 c (240g) whole milk

   1 c (125g) shredded mozzarella

   Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste

   Crushed red pepper or hot sauce, optional

   2 tsp za’atar

   Clues

   First, bake the baking soda. Preheat the oven to 250ºf, spread the
   baking soda out in an 8” x 8” baking dish and bake for 1 hour. Let it
   cool and set it aside. This can be prepped ahead and stored in an
   airtight container for several weeks. (Even though the baked baking
   soda isn't as strong as lye, which is traditionally used for making
   pretzels, it could still potentially irritate your skin, so avoid
   touching it with bare hands once it's out of the oven.)

   To form the pretzels, line two baking sheets with parchment paper and
   preheat the oven to 350ºf. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and then roll
   into snakes, about 3/4-1” thick. Smoosh the ends together to form big
   ovals and transfer to the baking sheets, one inch apart.

   (If using homemade dough, complete the recipe through the first rising,
   shape into ovals as described above, place on baking sheets lined with
   parchment paper, and then give them their second rise.)

   Make the baking soda bath: Add the water to the dish with the baking
   soda and whisk gently to dissolve the baking soda (it likely won’t all
   dissolve, a few baking soda chunks are totally ok as long as you remove
   any that stick to the dough). Using gloved hands, tongs, or a slotted
   spoon, and working in batches, immerse the pretzels into the mixture
   for 2-3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate or pan lined with a
   paper towel and pat them dry and then place them back on the baking
   sheet. Brush with the egg wash, sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds
   and a few pinches of flaky salt, and bake until deep golden brown;
   begin checking at 16 minutes. Let cool slightly and then enjoy warm
   with cheese sauce!

   These freeze well! Let them cool fully and store in an airtight
   container in the freezer for up to a few months. Reheat in the
   microwave or thaw at room temp.

   For the za’atar mozzarella sauce: In a saucepan, melt the butter over
   medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for another minute. Add half
   of the milk and whisk until thickened and then add the other half,
   continuing to whisk until thickened. Add the mozzarella and whisk until
   melted. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and spicy stuff, if using.
   Transfer to a serving bowl, top with za’atar and serve.

   Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge and then
   reheated in a saucepan or microwave. Stir in an extra splash of milk,
   if desired, to thin it out.

   -yeh!

   I’m so pleased to have partnered with milk life, on this recipe! Dairy
   milk always played a starring role in my favorite back to school
   moments! Bernie and I already obviously have a special bond when it
   comes to food (we just started introducing solids and she loves
   watching me cook!) – and I know as she gets older and goes to school,
   the role that food plays in how we connect together will only continue
   to grow.
