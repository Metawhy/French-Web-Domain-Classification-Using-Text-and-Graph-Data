What is jQuery?

   jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes
   things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling,
   animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works
   across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and
   extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write
   JavaScript.

   $( "button.continue" ).html( "Next Step..." )

Event Handling

   Show the #banner-message element that is hidden with display:none in
   its CSS when any button in #button-container is clicked.

   var hiddenBox = $( "#banner-message" );
   $( "#button-container button" ).on( "click", function( event ) {
   hiddenBox.show();
   });

Ajax

   Call a local script on the server /api/getWeather with the query
   parameter zipcode=97201 and replace the element #weather-tempʼs html
   with the returned text.
