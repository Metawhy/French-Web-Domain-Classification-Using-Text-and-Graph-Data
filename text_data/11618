   The Government offered Amazon no extra sweeteners to film its Lord of
   the Rings TV series in New Zealand, according to a senior minister.

   Trade Minister David Parker told reporters this morning that he had
   made it clear to Amazon that New Zealand had "a pretty effective
   scheme" in place already, through the Major Screen Production Grant.

   He said he told Amazon officials before Christmas: "We weren't
   proposing to change [the deal] to make it more beneficial for them in
   particular".

   Although stopping short of confirming the Lord of the Rings TV series
   would be filmed in New Zealand, Parker said an announcement on this was
   "imminent".

   But he said it would be coming from Amazon, not the Government.

   This comes after the Herald on Sunday reported that a "huge" part of
   the $1.5 billion series would be produced in New Zealand.

   An industry insider, who spoke to the Herald on Sunday on condition of
   anonymity, said they had signed a confidentiality agreement with the
   New Zealand Government and Amazon – along with everyone else involved
   in the Auckland production.

   Parker told media this morning that "strong interest is being shown by
   Amazon in basing that series here".

   He said he had one meeting with Amazon before Christmas and Parker said
   he "made it clear they were welcome in New Zealand".

   But he said he also made it clear that there were no further incentives
   other than those already part of the major screen production grant.

   He said the Government "obviously wanted" the series to be made here –
   "but you don't want these things at any cost; you want them on terms
   that are good for New Zealand and those are the things that are being
   thrashed out".

   He said Amazon was offered the Major Screen Production Grant – a
   subsidy scheme which provides up to a 25 per cent refund in tax for
   international productions.

   But Parker confirmed nothing beyond that had been offered.

   In fact, he was sounding downbeat on having to offer any incentives in
   the first place.

   "All of us, at some level, begrudge the film subsidies that the film
   industry have around the world, but it is a reality that they are
   subsidised."

   But he said if New Zealand wants to have a big film industry, it has to
   match the world market when it comes to those industry supports.

   Meanwhile, Parker denied reports that Amazon needed reassurance after
   the March 15 terror attacks in Christchurch that New Zealand was still
   a safe place to film.

   "I have never heard it said that they were worried about security ... I
   don't think it's been a big issue, otherwise, it would have come across
   my table."

   As part of Budget 2019, the Government added $25 million to the
   domestic filming grant and $130m to the international filming grant.

   Last month, the Government said it would introduce a new law to allow
   film industry workers to collectively bargain from next year, but
   striking will be illegal and the "Hobbit" law will not be repealed.

   Salmon has become the guinea pig of the seas when it comes to using
   technology to supplement falling fish populations. Now it's moved onto
   land - and into the laboratory.

   The fatty orange fish was the second-most-consumed seafood in the US in
   2017, after shrimp, and per capita consumption increased 11 per cent,
   to 2.41 pounds per person, from the prior year, according to the
   National Fisheries Institute, an industry group. Globally, demand for
   salmon has skyrocketed, along with that for all fish, fueling
   overfishing and threatening supply. Industrial-scale salmon farming,
   once seen as a solution, has its own problems. Massive stocks of
   smaller fish are depleted to feed farmed salmon, and parasites flourish
   in salmon pens where farmers use pesticides, contributing to pollution
   and ecosystem destruction. Sea lice have infested farms in Norway and
   Scotland in recent years, and a deadly algal bloom killed salmon in
   Chile, a top farmed-salmon producer. Farmed fish sometimes escape, too,
   contaminating nearby wild salmon.

   With rising incomes in developing nations driving demand, fish and
   seafood now account for almost a fifth of the animal protein people
   consume. Unsurprisingly, the need for a solution to this
   less-than-virtuous circle has become evident to a growing number of
   entrepreneurs and startups.

   The move toward environmentally conscious salmon farming is already
   underway.

   Maynard, Massachusetts-based AquaBounty Technologies is hoping its
   genetically modified "AquAdvantage" version of Atlantic salmon, which
   it says grows twice as fast, will soon appear in the shopping carts of
   the environmentally aware. The company says on its website that its
   product is raised in "land-based production systems" that eliminate the
   various risks farmed salmon pose to wild fish, humans and the
   environment.

   "The need and the desire for more farm-raised salmon is growing, and
   imports are growing, too," said Janice Schreiber, a commodity
   researcher at Urner Barry. "The market is looking for consistency, and
   that's where some of these newer lines come in."

   But the next chapter of fish production, beyond even land-based
   farming, is already being written - by scientists. San Francisco-based
   Wild Type is hoping that, as with the rise of meat substitutes (and
   their arrival on Wall Street), lab-grown fish won't be far behind.

   Or, for that matter, lab-grown sushi.

   On a recent Sunday evening in Portland, Oregon, a group of Wild Type
   employees, investors, chefs, local restaurant owners and friends
   gathered at Olympia Oyster Bar for the first full-scale service of the
   company's product, straight from the lab. Chefs Maylin Chavez, Kyle
   Christy and Rose Ha each served a pair of dishes designed to highlight
   the novel product.

   The chef's imaginations were constrained by the reality of working with
   a still-in-development food. Wild Type can produce only small pieces of
   salmon, which become too flaky if heated above 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
   As a result, all the preparations were either raw or cooked in natural
   acids, such as citrus juice. (The company says it plans to have a
   version of the product that can withstand heat in the coming months.)

   Highlights of the meal included a perfectly balanced ceviche with
   avocado, cucumber, katsuobushi, ginger and cilantro; a crudo of
   cold-smoked salmon with hazelnut butter, lemon, shiso and arugula; and
   a classic spicy salmon roll.

   The Wild Type product absorbed the cold smoking particularly well, an
   attribute the company plans to leverage as it launches the product
   commercially. One of the first items will be "smoked salmon," since
   it's something "people are comfortable with," explained Wild Type
   co-founder Justin Kolbeck. "We want to start with something that is
   familiar. We don't want people to find it strange."

   The tasting culminated in a sample of the raw product itself. Served in
   a canning tin, the Wild Type salmon appeared a bit dull, lacking some
   of the vibrant colors of wild coho. While the texture closely
   approximated wild fish, the taste, however, was lacking. It wasn't
   unpleasant or unfamiliar. Just faint.

   The company hopes to eventually produce full slabs of lab-grown salmon
   at a competitive retail cost of $7 to $8 per pound. But it has a long
   way to go. Kolbeck estimated that the spicy salmon roll served at this
   test dinner cost $200 to produce."The dream vision is the cleanest,
   purest, freshest salmon, without contaminants or antibiotics, for a
   price lower than farmed Atlantic salmon," he said.

   The Government offered Amazon no extra sweeteners to film its Lord of
   the Rings TV series in New Zealand, according to a senior minister.

   Trade Minister David Parker told reporters this morning that he had
   made it clear to Amazon that New Zealand had "a pretty effective
   scheme" in place already, through the Major Screen Production Grant.

   He said he told Amazon officials before Christmas: "We weren't
   proposing to change [the deal] to make it more beneficial for them in
   particular".

   Although stopping short of confirming the Lord of the Rings TV series
   would be filmed in New Zealand, Parker said an announcement on this was
   "imminent".

   But he said it would be coming from Amazon, not the Government.

   This comes after the Herald on Sunday reported that a "huge" part of
   the $1.5 billion series would be produced in New Zealand.

   An industry insider, who spoke to the Herald on Sunday on condition of
   anonymity, said they had signed a confidentiality agreement with the
   New Zealand Government and Amazon – along with everyone else involved
   in the Auckland production.

   Parker told media this morning that "strong interest is being shown by
   Amazon in basing that series here".

   He said he had one meeting with Amazon before Christmas and Parker said
   he "made it clear they were welcome in New Zealand".

   But he said he also made it clear that there were no further incentives
   other than those already part of the major screen production grant.

   He said the Government "obviously wanted" the series to be made here –
   "but you don't want these things at any cost; you want them on terms
   that are good for New Zealand and those are the things that are being
   thrashed out".

   He said Amazon was offered the Major Screen Production Grant – a
   subsidy scheme which provides up to a 25 per cent refund in tax for
   international productions.

   But Parker confirmed nothing beyond that had been offered.

   In fact, he was sounding downbeat on having to offer any incentives in
   the first place.

   "All of us, at some level, begrudge the film subsidies that the film
   industry have around the world, but it is a reality that they are
   subsidised."

   But he said if New Zealand wants to have a big film industry, it has to
   match the world market when it comes to those industry supports.

   Armageddon Expo at the ASB Showgrounds, Auckland.

   Meanwhile, Parker denied reports that Amazon needed reassurance after
   the March 15 terror attacks in Christchurch that New Zealand was still
   a safe place to film.

   "I have never heard it said that they were worried about security ... I
   don't think it's been a big issue, otherwise, it would have come across
   my table."

   As part of Budget 2019, the Government added $25 million to the
   domestic filming grant and $130m to the international filming grant.

   Last month, the Government said it would introduce a new law to allow
   film industry workers to collectively bargain from next year, but
   striking will be illegal and the "Hobbit" law will not be repealed.

The Beyond Meat of fish is coming

   Salmon has become the guinea pig of the seas when it comes to using
   technology to supplement falling fish populations. Now it's moved onto
   land - and into the laboratory.

   The fatty orange fish was the second-most-consumed seafood in the US in
   2017, after shrimp, and per capita consumption increased 11 per cent,
   to 2.41 pounds per person, from the prior year, according to the
   National Fisheries Institute, an industry group. Globally, demand for
   salmon has skyrocketed, along with that for all fish, fueling
   overfishing and threatening supply. Industrial-scale salmon farming,
   once seen as a solution, has its own problems. Massive stocks of
   smaller fish are depleted to feed farmed salmon, and parasites flourish
   in salmon pens where farmers use pesticides, contributing to pollution
   and ecosystem destruction. Sea lice have infested farms in Norway and
   Scotland in recent years, and a deadly algal bloom killed salmon in
   Chile, a top farmed-salmon producer. Farmed fish sometimes escape, too,
   contaminating nearby wild salmon.

   With rising incomes in developing nations driving demand, fish and
   seafood now account for almost a fifth of the animal protein people
   consume. Unsurprisingly, the need for a solution to this
   less-than-virtuous circle has become evident to a growing number of
   entrepreneurs and startups.

   The move toward environmentally conscious salmon farming is already
   underway.

   Maynard, Massachusetts-based AquaBounty Technologies is hoping its
   genetically modified "AquAdvantage" version of Atlantic salmon, which
   it says grows twice as fast, will soon appear in the shopping carts of
   the environmentally aware. The company says on its website that its
   product is raised in "land-based production systems" that eliminate the
   various risks farmed salmon pose to wild fish, humans and the
   environment.

   "The need and the desire for more farm-raised salmon is growing, and
   imports are growing, too," said Janice Schreiber, a commodity
   researcher at Urner Barry. "The market is looking for consistency, and
   that's where some of these newer lines come in."

   But the next chapter of fish production, beyond even land-based
   farming, is already being written - by scientists. San Francisco-based
   Wild Type is hoping that, as with the rise of meat substitutes (and
   their arrival on Wall Street), lab-grown fish won't be far behind.

   Or, for that matter, lab-grown sushi.

   On a recent Sunday evening in Portland, Oregon, a group of Wild Type
   employees, investors, chefs, local restaurant owners and friends
   gathered at Olympia Oyster Bar for the first full-scale service of the
   company's product, straight from the lab. Chefs Maylin Chavez, Kyle
   Christy and Rose Ha each served a pair of dishes designed to highlight
   the novel product.

   The chef's imaginations were constrained by the reality of working with
   a still-in-development food. Wild Type can produce only small pieces of
   salmon, which become too flaky if heated above 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
   As a result, all the preparations were either raw or cooked in natural
   acids, such as citrus juice. (The company says it plans to have a
   version of the product that can withstand heat in the coming months.)

   Highlights of the meal included a perfectly balanced ceviche with
   avocado, cucumber, katsuobushi, ginger and cilantro; a crudo of
   cold-smoked salmon with hazelnut butter, lemon, shiso and arugula; and
   a classic spicy salmon roll.

   The Wild Type product absorbed the cold smoking particularly well, an
   attribute the company plans to leverage as it launches the product
   commercially. One of the first items will be "smoked salmon," since
   it's something "people are comfortable with," explained Wild Type
   co-founder Justin Kolbeck. "We want to start with something that is
   familiar. We don't want people to find it strange."

   The tasting culminated in a sample of the raw product itself. Served in
   a canning tin, the Wild Type salmon appeared a bit dull, lacking some
   of the vibrant colors of wild coho. While the texture closely
   approximated wild fish, the taste, however, was lacking. It wasn't
   unpleasant or unfamiliar. Just faint.

   The company hopes to eventually produce full slabs of lab-grown salmon
   at a competitive retail cost of $7 to $8 per pound. But it has a long
   way to go. Kolbeck estimated that the spicy salmon roll served at this
   test dinner cost $200 to produce."The dream vision is the cleanest,
   purest, freshest salmon, without contaminants or antibiotics, for a
   price lower than farmed Atlantic salmon," he said.
