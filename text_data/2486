   Andrew Marantz is a staff writer at The New Yorker. His new book is
   Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, and the Hijacking of
   the American Conversation.

     “Some nonfiction can be reduced to a bulletpoint primer, but a good
     book is a good book. Whether it’s fiction or nonfiction, it should
     create a feeling, it should create a world, it should be a feeling
     that you want to live in and that tilts the way you see things.
     Isn’t that the point?”

   History Politics

James Burnham and the Managerial Revolution

     Power worship blurs political judgement because it leads, almost
     unavoidably, to the belief that present trends will continue.
     Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.
     If the Japanese have conquered south Asia, then they will keep south
     Asia for ever, if the Germans have captured Tobruk, they will
     infallibly capture Cairo; if the Russians are in Berlin, it will not
     be long before they are in London: and so on. This habit of mind
     leads also to the belief that things will happen more quickly,
     completely, and catastrophically than they ever do in practice. The
     rise and fall of empires, the disappearance of cultures and
     religions, are expected to happen with earthquake suddenness, and
     processes which have barely started are talked about as though they
     were already at an end.

Downtown Is for People

   On the then-new phenomenon of dead downtowns.

   Read more

     “It is not only for amenity but for economics that choice is so
     vital. Without a mixture on the streets, our downtowns would be
     superficially standardized, and functionally standardized as well.
     New construction is necessary, but it is not an unmixed blessing:
     its inexorable economy is fatal to hundreds of enterprises able to
     make out successfully in old buildings. Notice that when a new
     building goes up, the kind of ground-floor tenants it gets are
     usually the chain store and the chain restaurant. Lack of variety in
     age and overhead is an unavoidable defect in large new shopping
     centers and is one reason why even the most successful cannot
     incubate the unusual--a point overlooked by planners of downtown
     shopping-center projects.”

My Brother's Passing, God, and the Origins of Life

     In the normal universe, "to be" is annihilated by "not to be." But
     for reasons that are still a mystery to even the deepest math of
     physics, a bit of matter in a billion or so is not obliterated, it
     has no antimatter partner. It becomes a drop of experience.

   Paul Tough is a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine and
   the author of The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks
   Us.

     “The nice thing about a book as opposed to a magazine article is
     that it’s less formulaic. As a writer, it gives you more freedom —
     you’re trying to create an emotional mood where ideas have a place
     to sit in a person’s brain. And when people are moved by a book,
     it’s not by being told, ‘Here’s the problem, here’s the answer, now
     go do it.’ It’s by having your vision of the world slightly
     changed.”

   Andrew Marantz is a staff writer at The New Yorker. His new book is
   Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, and the Hijacking of
   the American Conversation.

     “Some nonfiction can be reduced to a bulletpoint primer, but a good
     book is a good book. Whether it’s fiction or nonfiction, it should
     create a feeling, it should create a world, it should be a feeling
     that you want to live in and that tilts the way you see things.
     Isn’t that the point?”

James Burnham and the Managerial Revolution

     Power worship blurs political judgement because it leads, almost
     unavoidably, to the belief that present trends will continue.
     Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.
     If the Japanese have conquered south Asia, then they will keep south
     Asia for ever, if the Germans have captured Tobruk, they will
     infallibly capture Cairo; if the Russians are in Berlin, it will not
     be long before they are in London: and so on. This habit of mind
     leads also to the belief that things will happen more quickly,
     completely, and catastrophically than they ever do in practice. The
     rise and fall of empires, the disappearance of cultures and
     religions, are expected to happen with earthquake suddenness, and
     processes which have barely started are talked about as though they
     were already at an end.
