Walk. Run. Serve. 9/11 Memorial 5K

   16:43 pm / General
   9/11 Memorial President Joe Daniels on the memorial plaza talking about
   the upcoming 5K Run/Walk. (Photo by Abigail Mullins)

   9/11 Memorial President and CEO Joe Daniels directs planning,
   construction, development and operations for the 9/11 Memorial. Through
   his work, he is honored to meet many of the families, colleagues and
   friends, of the nearly 3,000 9/11 victims. Daniels will share his
   personal experiences at the memorial, and much more, in the "Thank You
   for Visiting" series on the MEMO blog.

   This morning, I joined a small film crew on the Memorial plaza to
   deliver an important message. Run. Walk. Serve. On April 21, 2013, we
   will host the first 9/11 Memorial 5K Run/Walk and Family Day. The event
   takes place in lower Manhattan and is open to all.

   The day of the event—April 21—marks the anniversary of President Obama
   signing into law the 2009 Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. This
   historic bill established September 11 as a day of National Day of
   Service and Remembrance, in honor of those we lost in the 9/11 attacks
   and so many across the country and around the world who have engaged in
   acts of service and compassion in their memory.

   Please support the 9/11 Memorial and join me as I run in honor of the
   2,983 men, women, and children whose names are inscribed in bronze at
   the memorial. You can register individually or create a team to
   encourage family, friends, and coworkers to raise funds and awareness
   together. Register now. Visit 911memorial.org/5k to sign up today, and
   help spread the word by joining us on Facebook and Twitter.

   The memorial will forever be a tribute to the lives lost and sacrifices
   made on 9/11, but it’s up to us to keep our collective promise to never
   forget. Help us keep the promise this April 21.

   Thank you for visiting.
