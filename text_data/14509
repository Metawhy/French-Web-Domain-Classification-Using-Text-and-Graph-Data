Daily Report: Facebook Tries to Go ‘Mobile-First’


    By The New York Times

   August 24, 2012 9:07 am August 24, 2012 9:07 am (BUTTON)

   At Facebook, mobile is on everyone’s mind, Brian X. Chen reports in
   Friday’s New York Times. People are now spending more time using
   Facebook through mobile apps than on computers. And on Wall Street,
   investors are putting pressure on Mark Zuckerberg’s social network to
   master the mobile world so it can speed up growth and lift its sagging
   stock.

   But the challenge for Facebook, along with other companies like Google
   that got their start on the Web, is figuring the best way to serve ads
   to mobile users without cluttering up their small screens and driving
   them away in frustration. For now, mobile ads bring in less money than
   standard Web ads, so the shift to mobile threatens to undermine
   Facebook’s revenue.

   Facebook’s executives say the company is diving deep into mobile,
   starting with new versions of its apps for the iPhone and iPad, which
   it released Thursday. The apps are part of what Facebook executives say
   is a transformation into a “mobile first” company. Developing mobile
   products has been made a priority, they said in recent interviews, and
   every team inside the company has been reorganized with the goal of
   inserting mobile into its DNA.

   “We have basically retooled and focused the company around mobile,”
   said Mike Schroepfer, vice president for engineering of Facebook. “It’s
   been a huge change.”

   As part of the reformation, product teams have been arranged so that
   they now make mobile versions of new features at the same time that
   they are developed for the main Web site. Before, the company would
   make new features for the Web site, then a core mobile team would
   follow up with translations for mobile devices.

   Facebook is also trying to spread mobile expertise throughout the
   company. Its top engineers hold training sessions every week for 20
   employees at a time, teaching them how to program for Apple and Android
   devices. About 100 engineers are now working on Facebook’s mobile
   products, according to Cory Ondrejka, chief of mobile engineering.

   Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, described mobile as both a
   blessing and a curse for Facebook. Advertisers like that their ads are
   difficult to ignore on smaller screens — but at the same time, that’s
   what annoys users. “It’s what we call the mobile Catch-22,” he said.
   “You’re kind of stuck.”

Reactions to Verizon’s Deal With the Cable Companies


    By Brian X. Chen

   August 24, 2012 5:27 pm August 24, 2012 5:27 pm (BUTTON)

   The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved a deal that
   allows Verizon Wireless to purchase a huge swath of spectrum, the radio
   waves that carry wireless communications, from the country’s largest
   cable providers.

   The parties involved in the transaction are happy with the arrangement,
   but some others are less pleased. What follows is a round-up of
   reactions from some carriers and consumer rights advocates.

   Other than giving Verizon more spectrum to expand its wireless
   services, the deal allows the cable companies to market Verizon’s
   services, and the cable companies will be able to sell their services
   inside some Verizon stores. Parul Desai, communications policy counsel
   for Consumers Union, says this will inevitably strengthen Verizon and
   the cable companies’ dominance of the broadband market, which will hurt
   consumers:

     I think the deal essentially closes the door on achieving the
     competition the 1996 Telecommunications Act was supposed to achieve
     and opens the door to an unregulated wireless duopoly and
     unregulated cable monopoly for broadband services. The stronger the
     duopoly/monopoly gets, the more difficult it is for others to
     compete. This can only mean higher prices and fewer choices for
     consumers. It also leaves little incentive for innovation or
     investment in infrastructure.

   T-Mobile USA is thrilled. To win approval from the F.C.C., Verizon had
   agree to sell some of its spectrum licenses to another party to ensure
   that it wouldn’t have too much. T-Mobile, which was initially opposed
   to the deal with the cable companies, stopped fighting it and stepped
   up to purchase Verizon’s licenses. In a statement, the company said the
   transaction would improve its services.

     T-Mobile is delighted that the Federal Communications Commission has
     approved our AWS spectrum transaction with Verizon and we applaud
     Chairman Genachowski, the other Commissioners, and the FCC staff for
     their leadership and support on this matter. The combination of
     these new spectrum resources with our existing assets will add
     capacity and enhance performance of the T-Mobile network in many
     areas of the country as we turn on LTE services in 2013 to meet the
     growing consumer demand for mobile broadband services.

   Gigi B. Sohn, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a
   nonprofit that advocates for the openness of the Internet, also said
   the deal underscored the lack of competition in the broadband market:

     Now that it has blessed agreements that turn former competitors into
     allies, the F.C.C. must recognize that the facilities-based wired
     broadband competition policy has failed to keep prices low,
     encourage broadband build-out, and protect consumers.

   AT&T, whose attempt to get more spectrum by acquiring T-Mobile USA was
   blocked by the F.C.C. in 2011, was a good sport. An AT&T spokesman,
   Mark Siegel, offered a brief statement: “It’s always a good thing when
   unused spectrum can be put to work for consumers.”
