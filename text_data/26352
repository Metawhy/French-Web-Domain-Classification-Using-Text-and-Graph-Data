About eKomi


   New technologies are changing our lives on constant basis. Brands are
   created, known companies disappear, all while innovations are shifting
   our markets and the rules for businesses around the world.

   Consumers can interact with companies in ways that were unimaginable
   before. Word-of-mouth platforms and comparison engines empower buyers
   to share experiences constantly and instantaneously.

   Never have companies faced such pressure to meet their customers’
   expectations.

   Smart business leaders realize the importance of understanding their
   customers by answering three basic questions: Who are they? What do
   they want? And why? As such, customer feedback management has emerged
   as a vital discipline for any organization to successfully win, serve
   and retain customers.

   We believe that authentic customer feedback is crucial for the survival
   of any organisation.

   Companies with great products can not only generate, but also leverage,
   large quantities of trustworthy, genuine feedback, which create strong
   social proof. Sharing this constant stream of content with the mass of
   potential customers turns your vocal advocates into your best brand and
   product ambassadors, accelerating the reallocation of market shares.

   Our goal is to build the most innovative, versatile and universal
   feedback management system, turning organizations into customer-centric
   ones. We believe that our work is vital to ensure the sustainability
   and growth of our customers.

   Handling decisive insights to the leadership of thousands of great
   companies is a tremendous responsibility which we are honored to carry
   since our foundation. We would never have reached where we are today
   were it not for the core values that drive us: trust, smart work and
   hard work. Regardless of whether you are an employee, a partner or a
   customer: working with us means experiencing all three.

   With offices around the world, eKomi is only a moment away from helping
