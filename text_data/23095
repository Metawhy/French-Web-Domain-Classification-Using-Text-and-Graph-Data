Aims and scope

   Improving our understanding of the properties of civil engineering and
   environmental materials is a major issue for sustainable development.
   Indeed developing sustainable means for waste or CO[2] storage, less
   energy consuming and more sustainable buildings, etc, are among the
   most critical environmental urgencies. Nevertheless the materials
   involved have a complex, multi-scale, heterogeneous structure, implying
   that a huge variety of interactions, chemical and physical processes
   are concurrently at work, and collectively determine the material’s
   properties.

   The general purpose of Labex MMCD (Modélisation et Expérimentation
   Multi-Échelle des Matériaux pour la Construction Durable) is to develop
   advanced fundamental research for the detailed understanding of the
   physical phenomena governing the properties of construction materials
   and geomaterials, from their elaboration, through their usage, to their
   recycling. It relies on the various scientific skills available within
   the Paris-Est community, including theoretical and numerical modelling
   from atomistic to structural scales and experimental investigation,
   involving in particular innovative manufacturing processes and
   multiscale imaging techniques of materials.

   A wide class of materials is considered, including rocks, soils, cement
   based materials and concrete, natural materials as wood or hemp,
   polymer or glass based materials, as well as their combination leading
   to various ranges of composites materials; model materials without
   direct application might also be considered in view of the detailed
   understanding of specific physical processes involved in more complex
   microstructures. Questions regarding the optimal use of traditional or
   more innovative materials in constructions are also of interest, as
   well as surface treatments for their functionalization.

Partners

   Labex MMCD gathers three laboratories of comparable size, as well as
   two smaller research groups, building up a community of about 200
   researchers covering a rather wide set of scientific expertises.
     * Laboratoire Navier (Ecole des ponts ParisTech / IFSTTAR / CNRS), 60
       permanent researchers (total of about 180 people), comprising
       presently 5 teams: Geotechnique/CERMES, MSA (Architectured
       materials and structures), ME (Multiscale modelling and
       experimentation of heterogeneous solid materials), Porous
       (Mechanics and physics of porous materials), Rheophysics.
     * Laboratoire Modélisation et Simulation Multi-Échelle (MSME,
       Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée / Université Paris-Est Créteil
       / CNRS), 60 permanent researchers (total of 110 people), grouped
       into 4 teams: mechanics (MECA), biomechanics, theoretical chemistry
       (CT), matter and heat transfers (TCM).
     * Institut de Chimie et des Matériaux Paris-Est (ICMPE, Université
       Paris-Est Créteil / CNRS) with about 60 permanent researchers
       (total of 150 people), grouped into 5 teams, among which three are
       involved in the activities of the Labex: Complex polymers systems
       (SPC), Rare earth metallurgical chemistry (CMTR), Metals and
       ceramics with controlled microstructures (MCMC)
     * Centre d’Enseignement et de Recherche en Mathématiques et Calcul
       Scientifique (CERMICS, École des ponts ParisTech). About 7 among
       the 20 permanent researchers are concerned with the the development
       of mathematical and numerical methods for materials science and
       mechanics.
     * The team “Capteurs et Microsystèmes de Mesure” of laboratoire
       Électronique, Systèmes de Communication et Microsystèmes
       (CMM/ESYCOM, ESIEE / Université Paris-Est Marne- la-Vallée) is made
       of 6 permanent researchers (total of 20), specialised in the
       development of sensors and microfluidics devices. Formerly only
       associated member, CMM/ESYCOM is full member of the Labex since
       early 2015.

Governance

   Labex MMCD is coordinated by Michel Bornert, in charge of the
   management and scientific strategy.

   The scientific animation is organized within four thematic axes:
     * Axis 1: Multi-physics of nano-structured materials
     * Axis 2: Micromechanics, imaging and multiscale modelling
     * Axis 3: Rheology of complex fluids and materials
     * Axis 4: From materials to structures: stochastics and geometric
       aspects

   Roughly speaking, they refer to the typical scales of the phenomena
   under consideration, ranging from nanometric scales considered in Axis
   1, to metric scales of macroscopic structures considered in Axis 4;
   Axes 2 and 3 refer primarily to intermediate microscopic scales, at
   which matter might be described as a continuum, Axis 2 being focused on
   solid type behaviours, while Axis 3 considers fluid-type behaviours, in
   a large strain regime. Advanced fundamental scientific challenges are
   addressed within these Axes, through funded projects involving at least
   two different teams of the Labex, with complementary skills.

   In addition, since 2016, a few larger transverse projects have been
   funded and address more generic questions requiring wider ranges of
   skills to be addressed. Currently, three transverse projects are being
   funded.

   The main decisions are taken by the Executive Committee, composed
   of the Labex coordinator, the Axes coordinators and the heads of the
   five involved laboratories or research groups, which gather as often as
   necessary (about 3 to 4 times a year).

   An External Scientific Board composed of 6 international scientific
   experts and headed by Henri Van Damme is consulted twice a year on the
   scientific activities and orientations of the Labex. The “Conseil des
   Parties“, composed of the Labex coordinator and representatives of the
   supervisory authorities (Université Paris Est, Ecole des ponts
   ParisTech, IFSTTAR, ESIEE, UPEM, UPEC, CNRS, ANR) meets once a year.

Funding

   Labex MMCD has been created in March 2012 and is funded by the
   “Investment for the Future” program from the french government. The
   total grant is 6M€ for the period 2012-2019.

   About 80% if these funds are devoted to PhD or post-doc grants (see
   funded projects), 12% served to acquire specific laboratory equipments,
   4% are used to sponsor scientific events (international conferences and
   workshops, co-organised by Labex members) and to invite international
   scholars, the remaining being devoted to managing costs.

   Understanding the mechanisms of liquid transfer in wood

   Advisors: Philippe Coussot (NAVIER), Sabine Caré (NAVIER), Denis
   Courtier-Murias (NAVIER)

   Brief summary:

   The objective of this study is to understand the mechanisms of liquid
   water transfers in wood. Focus is made on poplar samples. We carried
   out a series of tests of imbibition with samples of different sizes,
   which allowed understanding that the longitudinal transfers can be
   divided in elementary transfers through the channel between two
   successive concentric tree rings. The original point is the study of
   these systems with MRI.
     * The water penetrates in capillaries of different sizes with
       different timings.
     * A critical finding is that with another liquid type but with the
       same viscosity the penetration can be much faster.
     * Spontaneous water imbibition in wood is slow due to the adsorption
       of liquid films as bound water in the cell-walls. The dynamics of
       imbibition in wood appears to be mainly governed by the
       longitudinal progression of bound water in the sample.
     * Synchrotron images confirm that the adsorption of bound water in
       the cell walls governs the process: it momentarily damps wetting
       then allows further advance when the walls are saturated.

   distribution in a 2D section of the sample (right).
