Welcome

Apache Ant™

   Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to
   drive processes described in build files as targets and extension
   points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the
   build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks
   allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can
   also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for instance C
   or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to pilot any type
   of process which can be described in terms of targets and tasks.

   Ant is written in Java. Users of Ant can develop their own "antlibs"
   containing Ant tasks and types, and are offered a large number of
   ready-made commercial or open-source "antlibs".

   Ant is extremely flexible and does not impose coding conventions or
   directory layouts to the Java projects which adopt it as a build tool.

   Software development projects looking for a solution combining build
   tool and dependency management can use Ant in combination with Apache
   Ivy.

   The Apache Ant project is part of the Apache Software Foundation.

Apache Ant 1.10.7

Sep 5, 2019 - Apache Ant 1.10.7 Released

   Apache Ant 1.10.7 is now available for download as source or binary
   from https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi.

   The Apache Ant team currently maintains two lines of development. The
   1.9.x releases require Java5 at runtime and 1.10.x requires Java8 at
   runtime. Both lines are based off of Ant 1.9.7 and the 1.9.x releases
   are mostly bug fix releases while additional new features are developed
   for 1.10.x. We recommend using 1.10.x unless you are required to use
   versions of Java prior to Java8 during the build process.

   Ant 1.10.7 is mainly a bug fix release with few minor enhancements.
   This release includes a major regression fix, which prevented the
   previous 1.10.6 release to be unusable on Java 8 runtimes. Among the
   enhancements, the junitlauncher task now allows including or excluding
   JUnit 5 "tags" during test execution.

Apache Ant 1.10.6

May 8, 2019 - Apache Ant 1.10.6 Released

   Apache Ant 1.10.6 is now available for download as source or binary
   from https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi.

   The Apache Ant team currently maintains two lines of development. The
   1.9.x releases require Java5 at runtime and 1.10.x requires Java8 at
   runtime. Both lines are based off of Ant 1.9.7 and the 1.9.x releases
   are mostly bug fix releases while additional new features are developed
   for 1.10.x. We recommend using 1.10.x unless you are required to use
   versions of Java prior to Java8 during the build process.

   Ant 1.10.6 consists several bug fixes as well as enhancements,
   including, but not limited to:
     * junitlauncher task now supports fork mode, to launch the tests in a
       forked JVM.
     * New tasks jmod and link have been introduced to support jmod and
       jlink tools of JDK 9+.

Apache Ant 1.9.14

March 17, 2019 - Apache Ant 1.9.14 Released

   Apache Ant 1.9.14 is now available for download as source or binary
   from https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi.

   The Apache Ant team currently maintains two lines of development. The
   1.9.x releases require Java5 at runtime and 1.10.x requires Java8 at
   runtime. Both lines are based off of Ant 1.9.7 and the 1.9.x releases
   are mostly bug fix releases while additional new features are developed
   for 1.10.x. We recommend using 1.10.x unless you are required to use
   versions of Java prior to Java8 during the build process.

   Ant 1.9.14 mainly consists of bug fixes and some enhancements in the
   signjar and verifyjar tasks

Apache Ant 1.9.13 and 1.10.5

Jul 13, 2018 - Apache Ant 1.9.13 and 1.10.5 Released

   Apache Ant 1.9.13 and 1.10.5 are now available for download as source
   or binary from https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi.

   The Apache Ant team currently maintains two lines of development. The
   1.9.x releases require Java5 at runtime and 1.10.x requires Java8 at
   runtime. Both lines are based off of Ant 1.9.7 and the 1.9.x releases
   are mostly bug fix releases while additional new features are developed
   for 1.10.x. We recommend using 1.10.x unless you are required to use
   versions of Java prior to Java8 during the build process.

   Ant 1.10.5 contains a superset of 1.9.13 - with the exception of a few
   tasks and features that no longer work with Java8 anyway (like the apt
   task).

   Both releases fix a regression in the get task and a bug inside the
   path traversal protection of the unarchiving tasks that was introduced
   with 1.9.12 and 1.10.4 respectively.

   Ant 1.10.5's java task adds support for the single file source
   execution feature introduced with Java 11.

Apache AntUnit 1.4

Jun 26, 2018 - Apache AntUnit 1.4 Released

   Apache AntUnit 1.4 is now available for download as binary or source
   release.

   This release fixes a few race-conditions in LogCapturer and the
   br-template inside the XSLT stylesheet used for creating the reports.

EasyAnt retired

Dec 13, 2016 - EasyAnt retired

   The Ant PMC voted to archive the EasyAnt subproject and all its
   modules. This means that all its resources are removed or made read
   only and no further development will be done.
   It also means that, if a community grows, the subproject could
   reactivated.

Apache Ivy 2.4.0

December 26, 2014 - Apache Ivy 2.4.0 Released

   Apache Ivy 2.4.0 is now available for download as source or binary
   (with and without dependencies) from
   https://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi.

   Key features of the 2.4.0 release are
     * some new Ant tasks
     * improved OSGI support
     * a Bintray resolver
     * numerous bug fixes as documented in Jira and in the release notes

   For more information see the Ivy home page.

Apache IvyDE 2.2.0

November 22, 2013 - Apache IvyDE 2.2.0 Released

   The Apache IvyDE project is pleased to announce its 2.2.0 release.

   The Apache IvyDE Eclipse plugin integrates Apache Ivy's dependency
   management into Eclipse. It lets you manage your dependencies declared
   in an ivy.xml in your Java Eclipse projects, or any other kind of
   project which needs dependency management. Apache IvyDE will contribute
   to the classpath of your Java project or you can make it retrieve your
   dependencies directly into your project. Last but not least Apache
   IvyDE offer editors of ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml files with
   completion. Get some preview here:
   https://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/screenshots.html

Major changes in this release

     * The API of IvyDE has been stabilized so that third party plugins
       can rely on it,
     * while still not complete, and still not advertised as stable in
       Ivy, support of OSGi has been added,
     * javadoc and source attachement can be edited now one by one,
     * improved stability of the resolve process,
     * improved logging for easier debugging.

Compatibility

     * This release is expected to work with every version of Ivy 2.1 or
       superior. The OSGi features require Ivy 2.3.0 or superior though.

   This release is considered as stable. The beta of 2.2.0 has been out
   for a (too) long time.
