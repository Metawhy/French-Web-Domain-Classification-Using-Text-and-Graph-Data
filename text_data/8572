Introduction

   Samsung just penned the death of the headphone jack with its newest
   phablet, the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink Galaxy Note10+ 5G. What
   else lies within that monolithic slab? In this teardown adventure, we
   breach its water-resistant seals, dredge its depths in search of
   elusive 5G chips, and encounter some surprising hardware along the way.

   Stay tuned for new adventures by following us on Twitter, Instagram,
   and Facebook. For iFixit delivered, check out our newsletter.

   This teardown is not a repair guide. To repair your Samsung Galaxy
   Note10 Plus 5G, use our service manual.

   Before we tear down, we take Note of these 10+ 5G specs:



   6.8" AMOLED Infinity-O display with 3040 × 1440 resolution (498 ppi),
   HDR10+ certified



   Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 paired with 12 GB RAM and 256 GB internal
   storage



   4,300 mAh battery



   Four rear-facing cameras (16 MP ultra-wide, 12 MP wide-angle with OIS,
   12 MP telephoto with OIS, VGA DepthVision camera), plus a 10 MP selfie
   cam



   Ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor



   S Pen stylus with Bluetooth connectivity and 6-axis sensor



   IP68 dust and water resistance rating

Step 2

   We lay out (from left to right) last year's Note9 next to the new
   Note10+ and Note10+ 5G and try to spot the differences. This year
   Samsung realigned the Note's cameras vertically. They also got rid of
   the rear fingerprint sensor—that's been moved under the display, like
   what we saw earlier this year. At last, we're forced to mourn the loss
   of the headphone jack—supposedly a necessary tradeoff for a larger
   battery and improved haptic feedback.

   It seems that Samsung, one of the last remaining Rebel allies, has
   decided to join the dark side.



   Before we get any further, Creative Electron gives us a peek at some
   interesting internals—looks like we've got some fun exploration ahead.

   Cameras on all the newest Notes are vertically aligned, but the 10+
   includes a fancy new feature alongside that stack of sensors.



   Samsung's DepthVision time-of-flight sensor—exclusive to the largest
   Note10—uses an infrared illuminator and VGA camera to quickly and
   accurately measure distance. This sensor enables or enhances many of
   the Note's features, including Live focus, AR effects, and 3D object
   scanning.

Step 4

   Annnnd we're off! The delightful duo Heat and Pick get under the back
   cover without breaking a sweat (although the same may not be said for
   their wielders). It's almost like they do this every day. This is
   standard procedure for most modern, glue-laden smartphones, but we sure
   wish that wasn't the case. As we slice away at the adhesive, we notice
   that, this year, the cover is contoured around the volume and Bixby
   power buttons—not quite the change to the opening procedure we hoped
   for. [lf3CAXOk2mXhThIy.thumbnail]

Step 5

   A few Phillips screws hold down the midframe assembly—nothing our
   tried-and-true Mako 64 bit kit can't handle! With the midframe removed,
   we encounter a somewhat radical change: the motherboard is solely at
   the top of the device, Pixel-style. While this allows for a wider
   battery, it makes the connection between mother and daughterboard
   trickier, necessitating these annoying interconnect cables that block
   battery access. [PO4uhbYhRmOcWPNV.thumbnail]

   At least the cables are on top, rather than under a battery and primed
   for pry damage. So far, Apple's interlocking "L" shapes seem to be the
   best use of space we've seen...

Step 6

   Our trusty iSclack works so well on heavily-glued displays that we
   decide to try it on this glued-down battery. The iSclack gives us some
   solid leverage on the battery, but it still takes a lot of isopropyl
   alcohol—and even more patience—before the adhesive surrenders the
   battery (beware those display cables!). [4ph2icJDDYDMBxTw.thumbnail]

   If we called the Note9's 15.4 Wh battery "ludicrous," the Note 10+'s
   16.56 Wh powerhouse must be "plaid."



   This energy bar weighs in at 59.1 g and measures 77.3 mm x 58.4 mm x
   5.5 mm. That's 4.4 g heavier and 3 cm³ larger than the Note9's battery.

Step 8

   Although relieved of its many cameras, this board still feels like it's
   carrying some extra weight. We pry off this mysterious green
   rectangle—which turns out to be a Qualcomm QTM052 mmWave antenna
   module. &quot;Millimeter wave&quot; refers to RF signals with
   wavelengths measured in millimeters (24 GHz to 100 GHz). It offers
   super-duper fast download speeds, but can't travel long distances or
   penetrate walls very well. TL;DR: YMMV. [PLTHOtZ2JYeUYEa3.thumbnail]

   TL;DR: YMMV.



   And one more thing: more board! Looks like Samsung took a note out of
   Apple's playbook and stacked their motherboard for maximum space
   savings.



   We've been down this road before—and with a little help from our hot
   air station, we quickly carve through the vias and separate the boards.

Step 12

   The daughterboard comes out without a fuss, bringing the soldered-on
   USB-C port and lower microphone in tow. Soldered-on isn't our favorite
   flavor of USB-C port, but at least there isn't much on this board, so
   replacements shouldn't be too expensive. We frisk the edges of the
   phone to find ... two more mmWave antenna modules! Given 5G mmWave's
   limitations, having these directional, beam-forming antennas on each
   side (plus the third one facing the screen) helps the Note10+ achieve
   maximum effort.

   The earpiece speaker looks pretty ordinary, except that it's completely

   Just a couple components separate this phone from emptiness: First, a
   square-ish vibration motor! For as long as we can remember, Samsung has
   employed the same circular LRA motor for all its phones' buzzers.

   Just a couple components separate this phone from emptiness:



   First, a square-ish vibration motor! For as long as we can remember,
   Samsung has employed the same circular LRA motor for all its phones'
   buzzers.



   This new, larger motor may be the first sign that Samsung is finally
   taking haptic feedback seriously.



   Or, hear us out—maybe they just needed something to take up a little
   more room where the headphone jack once was.



   Finally, we pull out the new vapor chamber—no doubt the product of
   countless hours of engineering, since this phone is essentially a space
   heater with a battery. 5G tech and reverse-wireless charging don't come
   cheap in the cooling department.

Step 14

   After some tedious behind-the-scenes heating and prying, we are
   rewarded with a peek at the backside of this Samsung-made 6.8” Dynamic
   AMOLED Infinity-O display. This is the biggest, brightest, most
   color-accurate display ever on a Note phone—but we can't help but
   wonder what's keeping Samsung from a refresh rate update to 90 Hz, like
   its phablet competitor, the OnePlus 7 Pro. The ultrasonic fingerprint
   sensor clings to the back of this behemoth display, just as it did to
   the S10 we tore down not too long ago.

   With the screen removed, we see that the earpiece speaker actually
   fires into a shallow metal chamber, which channels the sound waves into
   the teeny tiny grille along the top edge of the frame.



   Can't quite make it out? We couldn't either. Computer, zoom and
   enhance.

   We saw a 5G millimeter wave antenna for the first time.



   We de-layered Samsung's first "iPhone X" style board.



   We solved the mystery of the missing earpiece speaker grille.



   We even removed the stubborn battery without busting the display.



   We'll call this teardown a win, but we can't say we're the biggest fans
   of this Note, and we have a feeling the repairability score will bear
   that out...

Final Thoughts

     * Equally-sized Phillips fasteners means you only need to bring one
       driver for repairs.
     * Many components are modular and independently replaceable, but no
       more headphone jack means double duty for the USB-C port.
     * Every repair starts with painstakingly un-gluing the fragile glass
       rear cover.
     * Replacing the glued-down battery is tougher than ever, especially
       with board interconnect cables to work around.
     * All-too-common display repairs require either a complete teardown
       or replacing half the phone.

   Really impressive work. Love that another company has finally started
   using stacked boards. Thanks for the teardown!

   Will you guys do the Note 10 as well? I'm interested in seeing whether
   they've accomplished a density similar to the X.

Apple Watch Series 5 Teardown

   The Apple Watch Series 5 is here. This new model is very similar to the
   Series 4, but minor differences come together to power a display that’s
   always on.

Introduction

   Samsung just penned the death of the headphone jack with its newest
   phablet, the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink Galaxy Note10+ 5G. What
   else lies within that monolithic slab? In this teardown adventure, we
   breach its water-resistant seals, dredge its depths in search of
   elusive 5G chips, and encounter some surprising hardware along the way.

   Stay tuned for new adventures by following us on Twitter, Instagram,
   and Facebook. For iFixit delivered, check out our newsletter.

   This teardown is not a repair guide. To repair your Samsung Galaxy
   Note10 Plus 5G, use our service manual.

   Before we tear down, we take Note of these 10+ 5G specs:



   6.8" AMOLED Infinity-O display with 3040 × 1440 resolution (498 ppi),
   HDR10+ certified



   Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 paired with 12 GB RAM and 256 GB internal
   storage



   4,300 mAh battery



   Four rear-facing cameras (16 MP ultra-wide, 12 MP wide-angle with OIS,
   12 MP telephoto with OIS, VGA DepthVision camera), plus a 10 MP selfie
   cam



   Ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor



   S Pen stylus with Bluetooth connectivity and 6-axis sensor

Step 2

   We lay out (from left to right) last year's Note9 next to the new
   Note10+ and Note10+ 5G and try to spot the differences. This year
   Samsung realigned the Note's cameras vertically. They also got rid of
   the rear fingerprint sensor—that's been moved under the display, like
   what we saw earlier this year. At last, we're forced to mourn the loss
   of the headphone jack—supposedly a necessary tradeoff for a larger
   battery and improved haptic feedback.

   It seems that Samsung, one of the last remaining Rebel allies, has
   decided to join the dark side.



   Before we get any further, Creative Electron gives us a peek at some
   interesting internals—looks like we've got some fun exploration ahead.

   Cameras on all the newest Notes are vertically aligned, but the 10+
   includes a fancy new feature alongside that stack of sensors.



   Samsung's DepthVision time-of-flight sensor—exclusive to the largest
   Note10—uses an infrared illuminator and VGA camera to quickly and
   accurately measure distance. This sensor enables or enhances many of
   the Note's features, including Live focus, AR effects, and 3D object
   scanning.

Step 4

   Annnnd we're off! The delightful duo Heat and Pick get under the back
   cover without breaking a sweat (although the same may not be said for
   their wielders). It's almost like they do this every day. This is
   standard procedure for most modern, glue-laden smartphones, but we sure
   wish that wasn't the case. As we slice away at the adhesive, we notice
   that, this year, the cover is contoured around the volume and Bixby
   power buttons—not quite the change to the opening procedure we hoped
   for. [lf3CAXOk2mXhThIy.thumbnail]

Step 5

   A few Phillips screws hold down the midframe assembly—nothing our
   tried-and-true Mako 64 bit kit can't handle! With the midframe removed,
   we encounter a somewhat radical change: the motherboard is solely at
   the top of the device, Pixel-style. While this allows for a wider
   battery, it makes the connection between mother and daughterboard
   trickier, necessitating these annoying interconnect cables that block
   battery access. [PO4uhbYhRmOcWPNV.thumbnail]

   At least the cables are on top, rather than under a battery and primed
   for pry damage. So far, Apple's interlocking "L" shapes seem to be the
   best use of space we've seen...

Step 6

   Our trusty iSclack works so well on heavily-glued displays that we
   decide to try it on this glued-down battery. The iSclack gives us some
   solid leverage on the battery, but it still takes a lot of isopropyl
   alcohol—and even more patience—before the adhesive surrenders the
   battery (beware those display cables!). [4ph2icJDDYDMBxTw.thumbnail]

   If we called the Note9's 15.4 Wh battery "ludicrous," the Note 10+'s
   16.56 Wh powerhouse must be "plaid."



   This energy bar weighs in at 59.1 g and measures 77.3 mm x 58.4 mm x
   5.5 mm. That's 4.4 g heavier and 3 cm³ larger than the Note9's battery.

   Although relieved of its many cameras, this board still feels like it's
   carrying some extra weight. We pry off this mysterious green
   rectangle—which turns out to be a Qualcomm QTM052 mmWave antenna
   module. &quot;Millimeter wave&quot; refers to RF signals with
   wavelengths measured in millimeters (24 GHz to 100 GHz). It offers
   super-duper fast download speeds, but can't travel long distances or
   penetrate walls very well. TL;DR: YMMV. [PLTHOtZ2JYeUYEa3.thumbnail]

   TL;DR: YMMV.



   And one more thing: more board! Looks like Samsung took a note out of
   Apple's playbook and stacked their motherboard for maximum space
   savings.



   We've been down this road before—and with a little help from our hot
   air station, we quickly carve through the vias and separate the boards.

Step 12

   The daughterboard comes out without a fuss, bringing the soldered-on
   USB-C port and lower microphone in tow. Soldered-on isn't our favorite
   flavor of USB-C port, but at least there isn't much on this board, so
   replacements shouldn't be too expensive. We frisk the edges of the
   phone to find ... two more mmWave antenna modules! Given 5G mmWave's
   limitations, having these directional, beam-forming antennas on each
   side (plus the third one facing the screen) helps the Note10+ achieve
   maximum effort.

   The earpiece speaker looks pretty ordinary, except that it's completely

   Just a couple components separate this phone from emptiness: First, a
   square-ish vibration motor! For as long as we can remember, Samsung has
   employed the same circular LRA motor for all its phones' buzzers.

   Just a couple components separate this phone from emptiness:



   First, a square-ish vibration motor! For as long as we can remember,
   Samsung has employed the same circular LRA motor for all its phones'
   buzzers.



   This new, larger motor may be the first sign that Samsung is finally
   taking haptic feedback seriously.



   Or, hear us out—maybe they just needed something to take up a little
   more room where the headphone jack once was.



   Finally, we pull out the new vapor chamber—no doubt the product of
   countless hours of engineering, since this phone is essentially a space
   heater with a battery. 5G tech and reverse-wireless charging don't come
   cheap in the cooling department.

Step 14

   After some tedious behind-the-scenes heating and prying, we are
   rewarded with a peek at the backside of this Samsung-made 6.8” Dynamic
   AMOLED Infinity-O display. This is the biggest, brightest, most
   color-accurate display ever on a Note phone—but we can't help but
   wonder what's keeping Samsung from a refresh rate update to 90 Hz, like
   its phablet competitor, the OnePlus 7 Pro. The ultrasonic fingerprint
   sensor clings to the back of this behemoth display, just as it did to
   the S10 we tore down not too long ago.

   With the screen removed, we see that the earpiece speaker actually
   fires into a shallow metal chamber, which channels the sound waves into
   the teeny tiny grille along the top edge of the frame.



   Can't quite make it out? We couldn't either. Computer, zoom and
   enhance.

   We saw a 5G millimeter wave antenna for the first time.



   We de-layered Samsung's first "iPhone X" style board.



   We solved the mystery of the missing earpiece speaker grille.



   We even removed the stubborn battery without busting the display.



   We'll call this teardown a win, but we can't say we're the biggest fans
   of this Note, and we have a feeling the repairability score will bear
   that out...

Final Thoughts

     * Equally-sized Phillips fasteners means you only need to bring one
       driver for repairs.
     * Many components are modular and independently replaceable, but no
       more headphone jack means double duty for the USB-C port.
     * Every repair starts with painstakingly un-gluing the fragile glass
       rear cover.
     * Replacing the glued-down battery is tougher than ever, especially
       with board interconnect cables to work around.
     * All-too-common display repairs require either a complete teardown
       or replacing half the phone.

   Really impressive work. Love that another company has finally started
   using stacked boards. Thanks for the teardown!

   Will you guys do the Note 10 as well? I'm interested in seeing whether
   they've accomplished a density similar to the X.

   tear it down.
