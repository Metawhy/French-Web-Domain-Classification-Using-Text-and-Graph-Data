   Listening #202: Altec 604 & Audio MusiKraft Denon DL-103
   Art Dudley  |  Oct 02, 2019  |  11 comments
   Godzilla and I are precisely the same age: We were both born in 1954,
   Godzilla as an expression of the postwar fears of a nation uniquely
   aware of the horrors of nuclear armaments, I as an expression of the
   postwar comfort felt by an American veteran fresh from foreign wars. We
   both dislike being awakened from our slumber, and we're both unusually
   handsome.

   Accustic Arts Audio Mono II monoblock power amplifier
   Jason Victor Serinus  |  Oct 01, 2019  |  11 comments
   Accustic Arts of Lauffen, Germany, was founded in 1997 by Fritz Schunk,
   who sold the company to Hans-Joachim "Jochen" Voss in 2016. Voss's
   professional background had more to do with sweet spreads than sweet
   soundshe spent 20 years doing sales and marketing, including with the
   Ferrero Group, which produces Nutellabut he happened to own some
   Accustic Arts components, and as a music-loving consumer with a special
   fondness for rock, had been in touch with Schunk for many years before
   the company went up for sale.

   Graham Audio Launches the BBC LS5/5 in Montreal
   Robert Schryer  |  Sep 28, 2019  |  24 comments
   BBC LS5/5? I'd never heard of it until it was announced on my Facebook
   feed that the LS5/5 was Graham Audio's new flagship speaker—so new, in
   fact, that there were only two pairs in existence. One of them would be
   showcased that evening in a Montreal audio shop, Art et Son, for the
   model's official North American launch.

   PSB Alpha P5 loudspeaker
   John Atkinson  |  Sep 27, 2019  |  15 comments
   It is said that while any competent engineer can design a superb
   loudspeaker if allowed an unlimited bill of materials, the true test is
   being able to produce a great-sounding, budget-priced speaker out of
   parts that cost a mere handful of dollars. With PSB's Alpha series of
   bookshelf speakers, Canadian engineer Paul Barton has illustrated this
   truism many times over the years.

   Class-D audio amplifiers: What's the argument for them? Class-A audio
   amplifiers: What's the argument against them? Class-AB amplifiers: Why
   does everybody make them? Each of these amplifier output architectures
   has strengths and weaknesses. Each will interface more or less
   successfully with a given loudspeaker in a given room. Each has a
   distinctive sonic signature. Consequently, as knowledgeable audiophiles
   with a laundry list of system-building goals, we are required to choose
   the amplifier type that best suits our speakers, our room, and our
   individual musical-aesthetic predilections.

   Various Artists: Woodstock: Back To The Garden - 50th Anniversary

   Rhino Records A 587817 (10 CD). 2019. Andy Zax, Brian Kehew, reissue

   Performance *****
   Sonics ***

   Fifty years, man! By the time you read this, the dates will have passed
   during which promoters had hoped to stage a 50th anniversary Woodstock
   Festivalsadly, they failed in their effortand Woodstock mania will
   have peaked and diedeven pieces of the Woodstock stage are available
   to buy (I have two!). And yet the artifact that will always remain at
   the center of the era-defining event is this extensive and amazing
   audio document that the organizers had the foresight to record.

   40-Plus High-End Retailers to Celebrate New Abbey Road Mix
   Stereophile Staff  |  Sep 24, 2019  |  3 comments
   On Friday, September 27, Apple Corps, Ltd./Capitol/UMe will release, in
   various analog and digital formats, a remixed and remastered version of
   the Beatles' Abbey Road, commissioned in honor of that album's 50th
   anniversary. And on Saturday, September 28, between 3:00pm and
   6:00pmlocal timesover 40 perfectionist-audio retailers across the US
   and Canada, coast to coast, will mark the event by playing all 17 of
   the album's tracks, presumably on the finest imaginable playback
   systems. (It is a not-unreasonable expectation that at least some of
   these many playback sessions will take place at the same time, thus
   stimulating a great harmonic convergence. Or something.)

   Cary Audio SLI-80HS integrated amplifier
   Ken Micallef  |  Sep 24, 2019  |  28 comments
   New York City is forever being born. Lately, transnational capitalists
   are turning Manhattan into both an investment vehicle and playground
   for their platinum-level appetites. As real estate developments blot
   the city's skyline with competing glass-and-metal towers, mom-and-pop
   businesses collapse under rising rents and a lack of protection from
   predatory landlordsall the while such New York institutions as the
   White Horse Tavern, Cafe Edison, Bleecker Bob's, the Plaza Hotel, the
   Paris Theatre, and the Chelsea Hotel undergo massive change or
   disappear altogether. (Thank God for Katz's Delicatessen!)

   Recommended Components: 2019 Fall Edition
   Stereophile Staff  |  Sep 19, 2019  |  35 comments
   Products listed here have been formally reviewed in Stereophile, and we
   have determined them to be among the finest available in each of four
   or five quality classes. Whether a component is listed in Class A or
   Class D (or E), we consider it to be a genuinely recommendable product.

   Each listing, in alphabetical order within classes, is followed by a
   brief description of its performance characteristics and a note
   indicating the issue of Stereophile in which its review, and in some
   cases its Follow-Up reports, have appearedie, "Vol.41 No.6" indicates
   our June 2018 issue. And so forth.
