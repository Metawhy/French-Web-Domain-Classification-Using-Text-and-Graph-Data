Introduction

   Born from the complementarity between the field of health and the
   communication sciences, the LaTIM ("laboratoire de traitement de
   l’information médicale" for laboratory of medical information
   processing) develops a multidisciplinary research driven by members
   from University of Western Brittany, IMT Atlantique, INSERM and Brest
   CHRU (university hospitals). Information is at the heart of the
   research project of the unit; being by nature multimodal, complex,
   heterogeneous, shared and distributed, it is integrated by researchers
   into methodological solutions for the sole purpose of improving the
   actual medical benefit. The field of expression of this research
   focuses on the therapeutic action in oncology (ACTION team) and in the
   field of interventional therapies (IMAGINE team). Benefiting from a
   unit within the CHRU, the UMR (joint research unit) has (in addition to
   access to its own platforms) a privileged access to hospital technical
   platforms, as well as to all clinical data and patients, in a strong
   dynamic of translational research. The latter is based on numerous and
   varied industrial partnerships (SMEs, small office or large groups) as
   well as on a large number of partnership projects. Integrated into the
   national landscape of research, LaTIM is present in 2 LabEx, 1 National
   Infrastructure (France Life Imaging), 1 IRT (mutualized industrial
   research institute). It has a LabCom and is the holder of an
   interregional Hospital-University Federation. The research developed in
   the unit also enjoys strong international recognition through more than
   10 awards received in 5 years. Building on its previous experience,
   LaTIM intends to capitalize on the expertise of its researchers and its
   infrastructures to develop advanced research in the field of health
   technologies.
