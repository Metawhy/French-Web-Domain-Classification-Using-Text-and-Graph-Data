Free Webinar Explores Delivering Milliwatt AI to the Edge with Ultra-Low
Power FPGAs

   Submitted by Brian Dipert on Thu, 2019-11-21 06:00
     * Lattice Semiconductor webinar

   On November 19 and 21, 2019 Lattice Semiconductor's Hussein Osman,
   Consumer Segment Manager, and Hoon Choi, Fellow and Head of AI/ML
   development, will co-present two sessions of a free one-hour webinar,
   "Delivering Milliwatt AI to the Edge with Ultra-Low Power FPGAs,"
   organized by the Embedded Vision Alliance. The first session will take
   place at 11 am PT (2 pm ET) on the 19th, timed for attendees in the
   Americas. The second session, at 6 am PT (2 pm Central European Time)
   on the 21st, is schedule-tailored for attendees in Europe.

   Products with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities are
   increasingly being developed for smart home, smart city, and smart
   factory applications. Low power FPGAs are proving to be well suited for
   implementing machine learning inferencing at the edge, given their
   inherent parallel architecture. By combining ultra-low power, high
   performance, programmability and comprehensive interfaces support,
   these low power FPGAs give edge device developers the flexibility they
   need to address changing design requirements, including the ability to
   adapt to evolving deep learning algorithms and architectures.

   Lattice's iCE40 UltraPlus and ECP5 product families support development
   of Edge AI solutions that consume anywhere from 1 mW to 1 W on compact
   hardware platforms. To accelerate development, Lattice has also brought
   together the award-winning sensAI stack, which gives designers all of
   the tools they need to develop low power, high performance Edge
   devices.

   The first section of this webinar explores the sensAI stack, various
   system-level architectures to implement smart edge devices, and
   Lattice's end-to-end reference design flow that simplifies the
   implementation of target applications, including security and smart
   cameras, human-to-machine interfacing using voice and gesture, and
   object identification. The focus then shifts to memory management
   techniques, quantization and fractional settings used for deployment of
   small models on low power edge devices. Performance and power metrics
   are provided for common use cases, and are also compared against other
   hardware implementation options such as MCUs.

   For more information and to register for this free webinar, please see
   the event page for the first session at 11 am PT on November 19th or
   the second session at 6 am PT on November 21st (please make sure you
