Browse the OpenWrt/LEDE firmware repository

   These links takes you to the download directory of the current
   hardware, grouped by processor type of the devices.
   OpenWrt/LEDE software has two distinct branches: a stable Release build
   that is suitable for production use, and a Development build that
   contains an ever-evolving set of enhancements.
   Stable Release builds Development Snapshot builds
   The Release builds have had significant testing. Use them for
   production, or for your home where your family will rely on a
   functioning router. More... Get the latest with a Development build.
   These contain the latest technology, but may not work well, or at all.
   Be prepared to supply bug reports, etc. More...

Download OpenWrt/LEDE firmware specific for your device

   Go to to the Table of Hardware, to easily locate the latest official
   release firmware for your device hardware.
     * Refer to the file signing documentation to learn how to verify the
       integrity of the firmware downloads.
     * Refer to the Quick Start or User Guide, to install the firmware on
       your device

Get additional software packages

   After you have installed the OpenWrt firmware to your device, you can
   install additional software packages on your OpenWrt/LEDE device.
     * Packages per instructionset can be found here:
       https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/
     * Find out which instructionset your device has

Build your own firmware

   OpenWrt ships with its own complete build system, you can download and
   compile your own firmware from source, adding advanced tweaks or
   modifications that can be done only on build time. OpenWrt build system
   produces reproducible builds with checksums and git versioning, all
   firmware you compile will be exactly the same until you change options
   or you update OpenWrt sources. Start here if you want to compile your
   own firmware.

Assemble your own firmware

   OpenWrt provides convenient tools to integrate pre-built packages into
   a custom firmware image, striking a good balance between firmware
   customization and time/resources required. All packages integrated this
   way will be downloaded from the same online repositories used for
   updates, so the process will take minutes even on weak PCs. Start here
   if you want to assemble your own firmware.

Build your own packages

   If you just want to compile your program and create a custom package
   without compiling from source a whole firmware for all architectures
   you want to support, OpenWrt provides a convenient SDK package to do
   so. Start here if you want to create packages for your own software.

Buildbot activity

   OpenWrt has a number of buildbot computers building firmware releases.
   If you are interested in the latest developer snapshot release build
   activities, you can find the Buildbot activity in the following links:
     * Phase 1: target/subtargets
     * Phase 2: packages

How to mirror

   Please use rsync://downloads.openwrt.org/downloads to obtain a copy of
   the download repository.

   Syncing the downloads share every 12 to 24 hours hours is ideal. Once a
   mirror has been set up, feel free to announce it at
   openwrt-adm@lists.openwrt.org so that it can be published on this page.

   The data volume of the snapshots is roughly 35GB, we expect it to grow
   by 30-40GB with each release. Due to current bandwidth constraints we
   kindly ask you to use something like rsync --bwlimit=8000 when
   initially pulling the data.

Download statistics

   You can see a statistics for few last months. See “OpenWrt firmware
   image downloads” section and by link you can determine most popular
   router models.
