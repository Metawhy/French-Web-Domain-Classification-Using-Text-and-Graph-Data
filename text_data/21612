Floral Trellis Quilt (and Seam Tape is BACK IN STOCK!)

   September 9, 2019

   Floral Trellis Quilt

First off, thank you for your patience with me after the Diagonal Seam Tape
sold out… for now it is BACK IN STOCK!!!

   You can find the listing for it here, and I’ve opened up international
   shipping (read the description in the listing for more info).

   You can find the Diagonal Seam Tape website here with all the info
   about it, and my blog post about it here.

   I hope you love it as much as I do!

   Diagonal Seam Tape

   The last half of the summer was so jam packed I didn’t sew one stitch.
   Instead I made some pretty fabric piles like this one that sat on my
   cutting table staring me down for a couple months.

   I used some Rifle Paper Co. florals that I’ve been saving, and mixed in
   lots of basics to make a Trellis quilt.

   My kids started school on the 4th and I spent allllllll afternoon
   sewing while Jane played and napped.

   I used Diagonal Seam Tape to make the blocks super fast, and I sewed….

   and sewed….

   and sewed.

   I seriously felt like a new woman.  The end of the summer was long.  ;)

   I made the crib size of the pattern, and obviously I made the “ombre”
   version…sort of.

   The Trellis pattern can be found here as a PDF, or here as a paper
   pattern.

   Even though I didn’t get much sewing time this summer (hence the pile
   of fabric on my table), we did manage to get in a few sewing lessons
   for Sophie and the boys.  Sophie and I made a sleeping bag for her
   doll, and the boys made pouches and pillowcases.

   Next up is piecing quilts for Mom!  ;)

Diagonal Seam Tape™

   August 22, 2019

   How to use Diagonal Seam Tape while sewing

Back in stock in my shop here!

   I shared a peek at this last week, but I thought it probably deserves
   it’s own post since it took me forever to develop!

   I’ve been using painters tape as a guide on my machine for years…I even
   wrote a post about it 9 years ago here.   I usually use it for sewing
   diagonal seams instead of marking lines, but I also use it for making
   HST’s.  There are lasers, or plastic seam guides you can buy and attach
   to your machine with adhesives, but I found them bulky and a pain to
   use.

   So I decided to make my own tape that is pretty, functional, and easy
   to use.

   Diagonal Seam Tape™ is washi tape that is tough but thin, and easily
   removable.   I made a long web page devoted to it here:

   It’s placed in front of the feed dogs of the machine, and the red line
   is the stitching line, placed in front of the needle.  The black lines
   are just a perk, they represent a 1/4″ seam allowance and are helpful
   when making HST’s, keeping strips straight while strip piecing, or even
   helping a beginner learn to piece.

   Mostly you’ll use the red line for making diagonal seams without
   marking a pencil line on your square, like when making a snowball
   block:

   Or you can using it when making flying geese units:

   You can use it anywhere in a pattern that tells you to “mark a diagonal
   line”, or anywhere you need to sew a diagonal seam.   In patterns with
   multiple diagonal seams like Chickens, Bats, Trellis, or Shimmer…using
   tape is what saves me the most time!

   I could go on and on…but ALL the info and more is in the web page for
   the tape you can read through here.

   How to Use Diagonal Seam Tape to Save Time While Sewing

   You can find Diagonal Seam Tape in my shop here.

   I’m thrilled with how it turned out after months of thinking about it
   and working out the details of printing (long story short… it’s a big
   fat pain and costly to have something so precise printed on tape!).
   After using it on my own machines for a couple of months I can’t
   imagine not having it.   I don’t know if I’ll re-print it again, so I
   hoarded enough to last me at least until I’m 90… or until I get a
   sewing machine with a fancy laser guide built in (all machines should
   have them!).

Bats Quilt Pattern

   August 14, 2019

   Bats Quilt Pattern, Cluck Cluck Sew

   A couple of months ago I posted on Instagram that my 9 year old son
   loves bats, and asked me to make him a bat quilt after seeing the
   blocks for my table runners.

   At the time I didn’t want to make the bat quilt…but 200+ people told me
   to suck it up and make the bat quilt, and one person said that it was
   weird to make a bat quilt in June.

   So I made the bat quilt…

   …and I loved making the bat quilt…

   …and more importantly, he really loves the bat quilt.

   Really though, this was the most fun I’ve had making a quilt in awhile
   because I knew he was excited about it.

   Also it was easy to cut out, the blocks are big (15″ finished), and
   there are only 12 blocks so it’s a breeze to sew together.  It’s a nice
   throw size at 54″ x 69″.

   Kaitlyn quilted this for me, I wanted the quilting to look like windy
   skies, and this design worked perfect.

   Fabrics used:

   Blacks:  Juniper Black Dot, Circle Dot in Black, Large Hashtag, Blossom
   in Black (sold out but this, or this would be good), Costume Maker’s
   Ball Webs, Moon Harvest Black Hearts

   Background:  Blossom black on White

   Binding:  Black 1/4″ Stripes

   It would also be awesome with some Halloween-ish Kona cottons:

   Bats is in my shop here as a PDF, or here as a paper pattern.  It’s on
   sale through the week.

   I also put my other “fall-ish” patterns on sale too, Pumpkins, Mini
   Pumpkins, and the pdf version of Modern Holiday Runners (I’m out of
   stock of the paper version).

   Also here’s a sneak peek of a new product I have in the shop now…it
   makes sewing these bats together 1000x faster (slight exaggeration)!

   I’ll post more about it next week.  Also there’s a sneak peek of how
   linty my machine is….ick.

   Can you believe fall is right around the corner?!  I need at least
   another 2 months of summer!

   It went by too fast this time!!
