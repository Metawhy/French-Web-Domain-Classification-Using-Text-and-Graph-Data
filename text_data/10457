Take The Indoors Out with TimberTech


   This spring we’ve been tackling typical outdoor projects around the
   house. Flowerbeds weeded and mulched? Check. Patchy spots in the
   backyard filled in? Yes. Wooden patio set coated in protective
   polyurethane? Done. Now I’ve started setting my sights on something a
   bit more ambitious – the decks.

   When I bought my home both the upper and lower decks were painted a
   dark brown in the hopes of mimicking rich wood tones, but they failed
   and the paint has slowly been chipped and washed away. We’ve
   powerwashed them and considered re-staining, but at this point the wood
   may be too weathered for it to make much of a difference. That’s when
   TimberTech showed up on my radar. Their composite decking has been
   designed for high-performance and beauty, engineered to last longer
   than other wood alternatives, and with the most natural hardwood look.



   I’m not the most ardent at taking on outdoor tasks, so much of the
   initial appeal of TimberTech’s capped PVC decking – both in the core
   and on the surface – is in how easy it is to maintain while remaining
   sustainable. It resists mold and mildew, is long-lasting with a great
   warranty, and has unlimited design potential. TimberTech’s sturdy,
   wood-like texture comes in vibrant colors and diverse grain options to
   match whatever look you’re aiming for.




   One of the most exciting recent advancements is TimberTech AZEK’s
   Multi-Width Decking. Their Vintage Collection Deck and Porch boards
   give you loads of flexibility in dimension, style, color, and pattern
   by offering board sizes in multiple widths – standard, narrow, and
   wide. Go ahead and create a decking design that is uniquely yours and
   make a real statement by mixing and matching.

   TimberTech is so easy to work with that you can make it a
   do-it-yourself deck project, or hire a contractor and forget about it.
   The boards are engineered to age very well, and the colors are even
   backed by a 50-year limited fade and stain warranty. Choose from
   palette ranging from rich browns to grays and natural hardwoods like
   mahogany. The profile of every board has a solid feel under your feet,
   much like traditional decking but better because the sturdy capping
   repels scratches, dents, and even insects. Your TimberTech composite
   deck can take just about anything!

   Take advantage of the outdoor real estate that’s at your fingertips and
   extend the indoors out. That also speaks to your interior style – carry
   the colors and patterns you use in your home out onto your deck with
   throw pillows, lanterns, and furniture for a cohesive feel that carries
   throughout. Make your deck and your outdoor space an entertainment hub
   that you can enjoy all summer long!

   Design an outdoor space that perfectly captures your personal style.
   TimberTech makes finding inspiration easy – you can check out their
   Instagram gallery or if you’re chomping at the bit to start planning
   now, use their three-step process for choosing the right deck. You can
   even order free samples right here. I can speak firsthand to how solid
   the boards are and just how beautiful the wood tones look. TimberTech
   is shaping the future of decking with the use of recycled materials,
   conservation practices, and a new state-of-the-art recycling plant, and
   I’m looking forward to hopefully making it a part of my home.

Spring Tidying is in Full Swing!

   This post is sponsored by BabbleBoxx.com. All words and opinions are,
   as always, my own. Thank you for supporting the brands that help Design
   Crush create fresh content!



   Nothing has ever kicked my butt into Spring Cleaning Mode like my
   boyfriend moving in being on the horizon. But I’m already getting ahead
   of myself because, well, I’m not a great housekeeper. Everything is
   tidy for the most part, but when it’s just me there are definitely
   dishes in the sink and little tumbleweeds of dog hair in the corners of
   the living room. I’ve had about two months to prepare for A’s arrival
   and it was filled by lists of to-dos, but the timing coincided with me
   accepting a new job and I think I maybe crossed off three things. What
   it comes down to is that my time is valuable because it doesn’t seem
   like there’s as much as there used to be – I value things that help me
   take advantage of what there is.



   While we’re a ways out from doing any major kitchen updates, I’ve long
   wanted to research some projects like refinishing the cabinetry.
   N-Hance Wood Refinishing products are designed specifically for
   cabinets rather than walls and very durable as you can see after I put
   some samples to the test with both sandpaper and a hammer! (See the
   results below.) Their products are low VOC for a healthier kitchen
   remodel and cured with UV light for an immediate smooth, rock-hard
   finish. They can color match anything and going this route is a lot
   more affordable than traditional remodeling, leaving more money for
   things like countertops and appliances.




   As I mentioned, vacuuming is far from my favorite chore and something I
   really struggle to carve out time for. (Which really isn’t cool because
   I have five pets!) I’ve always been a little leery of robotic vacuums
   because they almost seem too good to be true. Would it be loud? Would
   it really get those dog hair tumbleweeds out of the corners? Would it
   suck up the fringe on my rugs? No, yes, and not if you fold them under
   first. At least that’s been my experience with the ECOVACS DEEBOT 600
   which can tackle both bare floors and carpets with ease and bounces off
   of obstacles without causing any damage. It’s smarthome compatible, so
   I can fire it up from just abut anywhere either by using the app, the
   remote, or my Google Home (it works with Amazon, too). I was nervous
   the debris container wouldn’t be large enough to hold all of that
   aforementioned pet hair, but was pleasantly surprised to find I only
   need to empty it once after cleaning the entire first floor. This is
   definitely the closest I’ll come to living like the Jetson’s!




   Dishes are quite possibly the chore I’m worst at. I do have a
   dishwasher that’s quite new, but it needs serviced so I’ve been washing
   them the old-fashioned way – by hand. Sponges aren’t my favorite
   because of all the bacteria they can harbor and the smells that come
   along with it, so I was really looking forward to trying out the Scrub
   Daisy by Scrub Daddy. This dishwand has an interchangeable system of
   cleaning heads that are uniquely shaped to scrub various shaped objects
   (think baby bottles, baking pans, etc). The ergonomic handle dispenses
   soap while you clean and the valet that comes with it all holds the
   pieces and self-drains. (Get $1 off any Scrub Daddy product here and
   try it for yourself!)

   What products are you loyal to or looking for to make taking care of
   your household easier?

CASETiFY’s Phone Cases Take It to the Next Level with Art + Customization


   Our phones are practically part of our wardrobes at this point, so it
   only makes sense that you would want a case that reflects your own
   personal style aesthetic. I’ve used phone cases from so many companies
   over the years, and the latest I’ve put to the test are from CASETiFY.
   I’m clumsy, I even managed to crack off a corner of Apple’s own
   silicone case, so when I say “test” you can believe it’s true. After a
   few weeks of use I can vouch for these guys, the side bumpers are
   especially tough which I love. Almost as much as I love the vast
   selection and customization options. Customize the heck out of one of
   their cases or go even further and design your own. CASETiFY is the
   leading artist-based community in the tech realm, which I’m happy to
   share and support – to be honest, it’s what sent me their way in the
   first place.



   CASETiFY’s latest collaborative collection is with Amsterdam-based
   illustrator Bodil Jane, who I’m a longtime fan of. Her playful designs
   are available for both your phone and your Apple Watch. I went with the
   Eyes design, it allows the color of your phone to show through as the
   background and the eyes have the slightest bit of texture to them.

   Bodil shares, “To celebrate the arrival of Spring, I wanted to
   incorporate lots of plants and nature-inspired designs, mixed into a
   collection full of playful colors. Much of the inspiration comes from
   my collection of antique botanical books. I wanted the collection to
   feel fresh, light and like something everyone wants to carry around all
   spring and summer. I’m really happy with the outcome!”




   You just can’t go wrong with a clean marble look, seen here in minimal
   white. After having a few cases that were made of actual marble, which
   I promptly damaged, this looks just like the real deal and doesn’t
   weigh nearly as much.




   This Neon Sand case will be going on my phone as soon as summer makes
   an appearance. The collection is available in four colors (VIP
   berry/violet seen here) and has some customization available that I
   opted out of. It’s a nice stress reliever to watch the sand move around
   the case and get this – it glows in the dark! If that doesn’t say
   SUMMER FUN, I’m not sure what does.




   I received product from CASETiFY in exchange for this post. Thank you
   for supporting the brands that help keep Design Crush creating fresh
   content! You can also check out their exclusive collections with
   Nordstrom and Anthropologie.

Olga Pokhodzey / Growing Up


   Russian-born artist Olga Pokhodzey was focused solely on street
   photography before turning towards self-portraiture and creating the
   series seen here – Growing Up. Be sure to check out the rest of the
   series on her site.

   “This series of self portraits is about relationships between people
   and things. Our surrounding objects were made for our comfort and
   designed to help us in everyday life and creative activities, but there
   is another side — sometimes we feel tied too tight with them, as if
   things appropriate us. I work from home, and sometimes spend 12–14
   hours a day in front of my computer. In such periods I practically
   don’t walk out, and then I begin to complain to my friends about
   feeling like growing into my chair. I decided to show this metaphor
   literally. Besides the theme of ingrowth, this series is about envy for
   the essence of objects. Compared to the human body, things are more
   sustainable.”

Chalk Drawers


   All it takes is imagination to redesign something that’s been taken for
   granted, like say a stick of chalk. Nikolas Bentel is ridiculously
   creative (he’s currently a resident at the New Museum design incubator
   program NEW INC.) and also ridiculously nice (I spent some time with
   him at ICFF last May). His ingenious Chalk Drawers are architectural
   drawing toys made of chalk, designed to create original patterns that
   are geometrically precise. The three drawers are designed to make dots,
   circles, or straight lines to give the user tools to create the three
   fundamental building blocks of drawing.

Spring ’19 Book Recommendations

   A Year Off: A story about traveling the world – and how to make it
   happen for you by Alexandra Brown and David Brown
   One part travel guide, one part travel essays and photos, and one part
   memoir documenting the story of Alexandra and David Brown, a couple who
   decided to take a year off from their jobs and ‘regular lives’ to
   travel the world together after only knowing each other for a few
   months. Each chapter provides perspectives from both authors and
   tackles a different part of the journey.

   So Here I Am: Speeches by great women to empower and inspire by Anna
   Russell and Camila Pinheiro
   A book about women at the forefront of change — within politics,
   science, human rights, and media; discussing everything from free love,
   anti-war, scientific discoveries, race, gender, and women’s rights.
   From Emmeline Pankhurst’s Freedom or Death speech and Marie Curie’s
   trailblazing Nobel lecture, to Michelle Obama speaking on parenthood in
   politics and Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza’s ode to black
   women, the words collected here are empowering, engaging, and
   inspiring.

   Mending Matters: Stitch, Patch, and Repair Your Favorite Denim &
   More by Katrina Rodabaugh
   This book includes more than 20 hands-on projects that showcase current
   trends in visible mending that are edgy, modern, and bold — but draw on
   traditional stitching. It does all this through four simple mending
   techniques: exterior patches, interior patches, slow stitches, darning,
   and weaving. In addition, the book addresses the way mending leads to a
   more mindful relationship to fashion and to overall well-being. In
   essays that accompany each how-to chapter, Rodabaugh explores mending
   as a metaphor for appreciating our own naturally flawed selves, and she
   examines the ways in which mending teaches us new skills,
   self-reliance, and confidence, all gained from making things with our
   own hands.

   the witch doesn’t burn in this one by Amanda Lovelace
   The witch: supernaturally powerful, inscrutably independent, and now —
   indestructible. These moving, relatable poems encourage resilience and
   embolden women to take control of their own stories. Enemies try to
   judge, oppress, and marginalize her, but the witch doesn’t burn in this
   one.

   Make Ink: A Forager’s Guide to Natural Inkmaking by Jason Logan
   The Toronto Ink Company was founded in 2014 by designer and artist
   Jason Logan as a citizen science experiment to make eco-friendly, urban
   ink from street-harvested pigments. In Make Ink, Logan delves into the
   history of inkmaking and the science of distilling pigment from the
   natural world. Readers will learn how to forage for materials such as
   soot, rust, cigarette butts, peach pits, and black walnut, then how to
   mix, test, and transform these ingredients into rich, vibrant inks that
   are sensitive to both place and environment.


   Feck Perfuction: Dangerous Ideas on the Business of Life by James
   Victore
   Renowned designer and professional hell-raiser James Victore wants to
   drag you off your couch and throw you headfirst into a life of bold
   creativity. He’ll guide you through all the twists, trials, and
   triumphs of starting your creative career, from finding your voice to
   picking the right moment to start a project (hint: It’s now). Bring
   your biggest, craziest, most revolutionary ideas, and he’ll give you
   the kick in the pants you need to make them real. No matter what
   industry or medium you work in, this book will help you live, work, and
   create freely and fearlessly.

   The Art of Feminism: Images that Shaped the Fight for Equality,
   1857-2017 by Lucinda Gosling, Hilary Robinson, and Amy Tobin
   A comprehensive international survey of feminist art – from
   highlighting the posters of the Suffrage Atelier, through the radical
   art of Judy Chicago and Carrie Mae Weems, to the cutting-edge work of
   Sethembile Msezane and Andrea Bowers, this book traces the way
   feminists have shaped visual arts and media throughout history.
   Featuring more than 350 works of art, illustration, photography,
   performance, and graphic design-along with essays examining the legacy
   of the radical canon-this rich volume showcases the vibrancy of the
   feminist aesthetic over the last 150 years.

   I Am Her Tribe by Danielle Doby
   #IAmHerTribe creator Danielle Doby shares her poetry for the first
   time, I Am Her Tribe is a collection drawing on the viral Instagram
   handle and online hashtag that serves to create moments of connection
   through empowerment and storytelling.

   The Future is Feminist: Radical, Funny, and Inspiring Writing by Women
   by Mallory Farrugia
   A roster of iconic women write about what it means to be a feminist
   yesterday, today, and tomorrow. These poets, essayists, activists,
   actors, and professors address topics ranging from workplace harassment
   to resting bitch face. The results are refreshing, provocative, moving,
   and hilarious. A diverse chorus of intersectional voices and a
   forward-looking stance set this book apart. It’s the smart, covetable
   anthology that women of all ages will turn to for support and
   inspiration in the ongoing fight for gender equality.

   Draw & Be Happy: Art Exercises to Bring You Joy by Tim Shaw and
   Cachetejack
   This illustrated handbook offers easy-to-follow drawing exercises —
   some thought-provoking, some meditative, all fun — inspired by
   art-therapy practices. Each page features an activity written by artist
   and activist Tim Shaw and brought to life with art from Spanish
   illustration duo Cachetejack, offering readers simple strategies for
   boosting their confidence, reducing stress, and expressing themselves
   in meaningful and joyful new ways.

   Single-Handedly: Contemporary Architects Draw by Hand by Nalina Moses
   An inspiring collection of 220 hand drawings by more than forty
   emerging architects and well-known practitioners from around the world,
   this book explores the reasons they draw by hand and gives testimony to
   the continued vitality of hand drawing in architecture. The powerful
   yet intimate drawings carry larger propositions about materials, space,
   and construction, and each one stands on its own as a work of art.
