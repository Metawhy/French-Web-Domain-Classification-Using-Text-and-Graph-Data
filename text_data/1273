       Transfer Station
       Our transfer stations serve as public drop-off locations for
       materials to be hauled and processed at nearby compost or recycling
       facilities. Depending on the facility, items may be sorted and then
       taken to their respective processing facilities based on material
       type.
       Transfer stations typically accept all sorts of recyclable
       materials. Please see the accepted items list or check with us
       before visiting to ensure acceptance of certain wastes.
