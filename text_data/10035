   Endangered
   October 2017

   Endangered is a 'powerful visual record of remarkable animals and
   ecosystems facing harsh challenges.' Not only is this book a document
   of endangered species 'it is a unique experiment exploring the role of
   imagery in fostering an emotional connection with species and their
   habitats.' With epilogue and prologue by Professor Jonathan Baillie and
   text by Sam Wells, Flach hopes 'that his work will inspire, challenge,
   and inform - that we might use this book as a springboard for positive
   action.'

   Evolution
   2013

   Stern Portfolio No.74

   In the history of photography there have been two ways of photographing
   animals, and two kinds of animal photographers.
   There are the great wildlife photographers who battle through the wilds
   of Africa or Alaska or some dense jungle for months, coalescing with
   nature to show us animals as they live in the wild. These photographers
   are quiet, polite visitors to a world that can only prosper if we do
   not disturb it. The other kind of animal photographer puts animals on
   public display, as it were. Towering over the animals, they simply want
   to show us all the great things animals can do when we humans are their
   masters. Those millions of snapshots taken by dog or cat owners keen to
   demonstrate how nicely their little domestic friends can run or hop
   over stick or stone. And there is a similar phenomenon in professional
   photography where animals become fashion accessories – a leopard
   wearing a collar – or mere gags, like the snake wrapped around a
   model’s neck. I must admit I’ve never been interested in pictures like
   that because they display no interest in the animals themselves. But
   when I first saw Tim Flach’s photos on my desk, I knew I’d found
   somebody who understood how I feel. Flach’s photos show great respect
   for animals, nature and, if you like, creation in its entirety. I spent
   ages looking at those photographs and into the animals’ eyes, and tried
   to think as they would; I was amazed by the incredible design of snakes
   and jellyfish, laughed at the leather-caped fruit bats looking so
   expectantly into the night, and would have loved to have run my fingers
   through the owl’s wild plumage. And in that instant I’d forgotten all
   the other animal photographers who had never interested me anyway.

   More Than Human
   2012

   “What underlines my work in this project, are the questions about how
   we shape nature and how it shapes us”
   Published in October 2012, this is Tim Flach’s third book.

   By removing them from their natural environment and placing them in
   minimal studio–like settings, the images map over a style of human
   portraiture.
   Tim’s aim was to “illuminate the relationship between human and
   non-human animals – to make an inquiry into how these relationships
   occupy anthroprocentric space.
   More Than Human was published worldwide in October 2012 and is
   available from the following publishers.

   Dogs Gods
   2010

   This is the tale of our oldest, most faithful friend, the species that
   came in from the cold more than 15,000 years ago to keep us
   company and share our food.

   These incredibly adaptable animals extend our senses, make us more
   successful and happier, do our work in the country and the city; they
   are tough enough to haul us for days across icy wastelands and delicate
   enough to snooze gently in the warming of an elegant lap. They can
   entertain us, protect us, teach us how to love, do what they are told,
   and tell us what is going to happen next. They can even extend our
   lives. We think we train them to do the work but they have in turn
   found a way for us to provide for them. This great bond that has forged
   so many different forms of dog is the inspiration for this book. The
   result is an unprecedented insight and visualization of what dogs are
   and can be. Now new ways of living and new findings in research reveal
   our relationship with these much-loved creatures is even more intense
   and vital than we previously thought. In insightful stories and
   eye-opening images, Dogs Gods shows us that our great companions may
   not only be remarkable as dogs –they can also hold the key to new
   understandings of what it is to be human.
   Dogs Gods was published worldwide in October 2010 and is available from
   the following publishers.

   Equus
   2008

   Equus: the family of animals that goes from Ass to Zebra, but is mostly
   Horses.

   No animal has captured the human imagination quite like the horse,
   first depicted in cave drawings thousands of years ago through to
   countless renderings
   in paint, clay, ink and film. My quest to
   document the horse has resulted in EQUUS, my first book. Intended as an
   exploration of the species in its own right - captured as solitary
   subject and en masse; from the air and underwater - EQUUS celebrates
   the animal whose history is so powerfully linked to our own. From
   exquisite Arabians in the Royal Yards of the United Arab Emirates to
   Icelandic horses in their glacial habitat; from the soulful gaze of a
   single horse’s lash-lined eye to the thundering majesty of mustangs
   racing across the plains of Utah, EQUUS provides a unique insight into
   the physical dynamics and spirit of the horse.
   EQUUS was published worldwide in October 2008 and is available from the
   following publishers.
