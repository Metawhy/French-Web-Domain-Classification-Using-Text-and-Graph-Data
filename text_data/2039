New Report: Who is behind the wheel? Fixing the global standards on company
ownership

   To counter crime and corruption, law enforcement authorities around the
   world need to be able to swiftly uncover the identities of the real
   owners of companies. Transparency International argues that public
   registers of beneficial ownership should be the norm.

هل سيشعل الفساد المستشري فتيل الخريف العربي؟

   خلال الشهرين الماضيين، اجتاحت موجة من الاحتجاجات شوارع مصر والعراق
   ولبنان. وبلغ عدد المحتجين الذين نزلوا إلى الشوارع في لبنان أكثر من
   مليون شخص ينددون بالظلم، وكان ذلك غالبا في تحدّ للقمع العنيف الذي
   تمارسه السلطات. وعلى الرغم من اختلاف المطالب التي نادى بها المحتجون في
   البلدان الثلاثة، بل تختلف حتى فيما بين الحركات في نفس البلد، إلا أن هذا
   الغضب العارم قام على قاسم مشترك بينها: الفساد وسوء الإدارة المالية
   للحكومات.

Right to information: a tool for people power

   Globally, approximately 120 countries have right to information laws.
   In some countries, these laws are top notch, but in others, the laws
   either don’t exist or need significant improvements. On International
   Right to Know Day, citizens are speaking out around the world to demand
   greater accountability from government. But are most people even aware
   of their right to request information in the first place?

   The Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Latin America and the Caribbean

Reliance on information from banks hindering corruption and money laundering
investigations

   In a new report, Transparency International says that authorities are

   registers of the real owners of companies.
