       When I think of some of the most rustic and elegant fall gifts from
       nature, bittersweet always comes to mind. I first fell in love with
       bittersweet back in the 90‚Äôs when I started seeing it used in
       primitive and country decor. Read more

       Vignette with Bittersweet Decorating with Bittersweet for fall
       Welcome friends and HAPPY FALL! Today I am sharing a few photos of
       a French vintage style fall vignette that I recently styled on top
       of the vintage chest in our dining room. This week I found some
       dried bittersweet at a vintage shop and I couldn‚Äôt wait to play
       around with it in my fall decorating. When I brought the
       bittersweet home I just laid it on the chest until I could figure
       out what to do with it. Before I walked away I realized that it
       looked pretty there, and that‚Äôs how my impromptu French vintage
       fall vignette with bittersweet came about.  Read more

       Hello friends! Are you in a fall mood yet? It has been hard to get
       the fall feels with 95 degree weather recently, but seeing all the
       fall recipes on Pinterest  and link parties this week sure did make
       me start craving pumpkin spice and everything nice! Having gluten,
       dairy and egg allergies has made it nearly impossible to enjoy
       yummy fall baked goods, but this past year I discovered 1-2-3
       Gluten Free baking mixes at our local health food store and I have
       been very pleased with the brand. Read more

       only one week away from the official start of fall on the calendar.
       Here in KY it has been so hot that I have had to stay inside most
       of the day and I even had to pull the blinds closed during the
       hottest part of the day because the sun was so bright! Surely those
       fall temperatures are just around the corner. For now I am getting
       my fall inspiration and home decor ideas while I am nice and cool
       indoors by checking out all the fantastic ideas here at the party.

       Early Fall living room decor
       On Wednesday I shared my Early Fall Living Room Refresh as part of
       the Fall Home Tours hosted by A Stroll Thru Life. I will be
       changing my fall decor as the season progresses to reflect the
       changes in nature, but for right now I am still enjoying lots of
       green and pops of bright fall color.




       I also started playing around with decorating with pears in the
       dining room, but they looked so tasty I gave up and decided to eat
       them!



       I am working on a tablescape for next week‚Äôs Fall Tablescape hop
       hosted by Celebrate and Decorate. I do plan to incorporate pears,
       so I am headed back to buy some more today. They just have to make
       it through the photos, then they are ‚Äúripe‚Äù for the taking!

Now it‚Äôs time for some beautiful features from last week‚Äôs TFT party!

       Hello friends! I hope you all had a wonderful holiday! Labor Day
       has come and gone, so that means fall is here, right? Well, not
       exactly, but it‚Äôs certainly okay to start transitioning our home
       decor from summer to fall. If you struggle with decorating between
       summer and fall then you‚Äôve come to the right place! *This post

       Welcome friends! With August coming to a close I have been tidying
       up the garden, harvesting herbs, and planting seeds for cool
       weather crops. This week I harvested some of the beautiful
       eucalyptus that my son bought me for Mother‚Äôs Day. Once I brought
       it inside and put it in a simple glass hobnail vase, I thought it
       looked so pretty and I was inspired to create a little vignette in
       the dining room.*This post contains affiliate links. Read more

       Hello friends and welcome back to my Pin Away Wednesdays series!
       Today I am sharing highlights from my Allergy-Friendly Cooking and
       Recipes Pinterest board. For this post I am just focusing on some
       of my favorite fall recipes, but I have pinned plenty of other
       year-round recipes as well. I also pin tips and tricks/conversions
       for allergy-free cooking to this board. Even if you don‚Äôt have food
       allergies, these recipes are super healthy (whole
       foods/refined-sugar free) without sacrificing taste. Most of them
       do not require any special ingredients and are fairly simple to
       make. Here are some of the recipes that I plan to make this fall.

       There are several things I am always on the hunt for when I go
       junkin‚Äô, and baskets are high up on the list.  Outdated baskets can
       be found inexpensively at yard sales and thrift shops, and
       sometimes it only takes a little paint to complete transform them.
       Such was the case with this reddish, primitive style basket I found
       this past weekend at a yard sale for only $2.00. *This post

       Hello friends and welcome back for another post in my weekly Pin
       Away Wednesday series! Even though there is still a little over a
       month until fall, school started back today in our area which is
       always the unofficial end of summer. My family is headed back to
       the beach in a couple of weeks for a weekend, which means I am
       certainly not out of summer mode just yet, but after that I will be
       all about fall! Fall is my favorite season and I have several
       fall-related Pinterest boards that I will be sharing over the next
       couple of months as part of this series. For my first fall post
       during this transitional time of year, I am sharing highlights from
       my Farmhouse Fall Decor board. If you love farmhouse style and all
       things fall, get ready to pin away!

       Hello everyone, back again with a little post exploring vintage
       decorating style and current home decor trends. A very popular look
       right now is ‚ÄúBoho-Chic‚Äù which can be sometimes referred to as
       minimalist farmhouse, or Fixer Upper style, although these are
       broad terms open to interpretation by the designer. This trend
       might not appeal to all vintage decor and collecting enthusiasts,
       but for those of us who like to change things up from time to time
       to keep our vintage style homes looking fresh and interesting, it
       can be fun to explore  these popular style trends. Let‚Äôs take a
       look at the Boho Chic style that is all the rage.  *This post

       the season? I have been working on several different makeovers and
       refreshes all throughout the house, concentrating mainly on
       unifying each room with a neutral color scheme which is calm and
       classic. Even within neutral homes, adding fresh touches of green
       using indoor plants can be very much needed for interest and a bit
       of color. Indoor plants can work in all different styles of homes,
       especially modern or boho chic. Today I am sharing some beautiful
       plants that will work beautifully for those of us who prefer,

       clean retreat as well. Think of the welcoming feeling it will give
