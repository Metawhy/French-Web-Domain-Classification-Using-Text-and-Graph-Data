Reasons To Visit Ecuador

   In April, I was privileged to be sponsored to go to Ecuador. I was in a
   group who went to Ecuador and worked in several orphanages. It was
   probably the best time of my life. It really was!
   I was in Ecuador for only about 9 days, but it was great! I loved the
   people! and I loved the culture! I would have loved it even more if I
   was able to communicate since I don't speak Spanish- biggest regret of
   high school!
   We traveled for 2 days to get to Ecuador, and arrived at night. It was
   the first time I had ever been out of the country, and I loved it. Even
   at night, I was so impressed! It was beautiful!!
   We traveled to Cuenca after landing in Quito and got to our "home" for
   the next week or so.
   While I was there I:
     * Ziplined through a jungle/forest.
     * Ate guinea pig
     * went to a Cathedral
     * Performed "The Three Little Pigs" in Spanish. Keep in mind that I
       only speak English
     * Fell in love with the culture.
     * Somewhat started learning Spanish
     * Bought Ecuadorian lottery tickets

   It was the best time you could imagine.
   I still find myself wishing I was back in the wonderful city or back
   with the culture of helping people even if you can't solve every
   problem. The culture was such a loving, caring atmosphere, yet it felt
   as though no one wanted to be a bother for anyone else.
   They had such pride in their cities and each other. It was definitely a
   change from the United States, where if there's a candy wrapper laying
   on the road, people ignore it. In Ecuador they had cleaning crews hired
   to maintain the cities and if there was trash laying around, regular
   people would pick it up while they walked to the store or restaurant
   they were headed to. They had such a sense of pride and accomplishment.
   I will always say I left a part of me in Ecuador, and I need to go back
   to Ecuador.

Missing In Action

   So it's safe to say things in my life have been crazy since I first
   started this blog.
     * I started a new "real" job
     * My dad passed away
     * My mom's health has declined as well
     * I started working on my personal health and devoting time to myself

   So, it's safe to say that this blog was put on the backburner.
   But, I'm baaaaack. :)
   Stayed tuned because I won't be staying in the background much longer.

Finding The Right Pixie Cut.

   It's hard to make a change so dramatic with your hair. It's a big
   change! If you're like I am, and your hair doesn't grow very fast, then
   it's a big commitment! But trust me. It's the smartest decision you
   could ever make concerning your hair. It makes it so healthy, unless
   you dye it crazy colors and put crazy chemicals on it.
   Finding the right pixie cut is the most important thing. My philosophy
   is that every single person can pull off short hair, they just have to
   find the right cut.
   But how do you do that?
   Here's some helpful tips that I slowly realized when I was looking for
   "The One".
   1. Decide if you want long or short bangs.
   This will truly save you more time that you would think.
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-xMxpQqIvhq0%2FU-7bN4TjaKI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAJc%2FZDcW5rEvg2o%2Fs1600%2Fa.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;g
   adget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   Here's the difference.

   2FAAAAAAAAAJk%2FntbLI2Zlie0%2Fs1600%2Faaaaa.jpg&amp;container=blogger&a
   mp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   2. Decide if you want shaved sides or not.

   2FAAAAAAAAAJg%2FGW9AMYrem3s%2Fs1600%2Faaaaaaa.jpg&amp;container=blogger
   &amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   Here's the difference.

   3. Remember that the color of hair in the picture isn't always the same
   color of hair you will.
   Trust me. It'll make a difference.

   2FAAAAAAAAAJ8%2FY8AChG_D0Nc%2Fs1600%2Fabaa.jpg&amp;container=blogger&am
   p;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   Here's the difference
   These are relatively the same cut, just different colors and
   that makes them seem and feel different.

   2FAAAAAAAAAJs%2FLZ2WSiDL7uc%2Fs1600%2Faaaaaaaa.jpg&amp;container=blogge
   r&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   4.Decide if you will do two colors or not.
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-V_gUx1rNOx8%2FU-7bQRJQkPI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAKA%2FNh4FZXZSJLQ%2Fs1600%2Fabab.jpg&amp;container=blogger&am
   p;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   The difference.

   2FAAAAAAAAAJ0%2FYk81srKDsOM%2Fs1600%2Fab.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;
   gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   But no matter what you decide to go with, Just remember you can have
   fun with it!
   [aaaaaaaaa.jpg]
   Somedays I spike mine in the back and other days I curl it. Other days
   I poof the front and have tons of body, and sometimes I'll just put on
   a beanie. Just remember to have fun with it!
   Check out my post, Pixie Cuts Are Heavenly to see my thoughts about
   cutting my hair into a pixie.
   Thanks for reading! :)

Everyone Needs A Little Pep Talk Every Now & Then

   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-exMb2camiEc%2FU-1nilNhNII%
   2FAAAAAAAAAIo%2FVqJRBxpqH_M%2Fs1600%2Fb847cffb53150bb63b8212a6ec79847b.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   Something I always do when I find myself getting down or feeling sad, I
   always try on my own to boost my spirits before I turn to anyone else.
    I've been known to be very independant and self-sufficient, but we
   cannot maintain the strong image that we all try so hard to do. So when
   I find myself trying to cheer myself up, I usually end up listening to
   music. Yes, by now if youve read any of my posts, you know I love
   music.. just a little. :)
   Anyways, I tend to listen to a certain song called, Beneath Your
   Beautiful, by Labrinth featuring Emeli Sande. I love, love, love this
   song. I talk about it in my post, Songs Everyone Should Listen To (My
   Playlist), so check that out if you end up liking this song. (:
   So while you listen to this song ,I hope you clicked the link, :) I
   want you to read the words, because that's what cheers me up the most.
   And the music is beautiful as well.
   Here are the lyrics, (I don't own them).
   "  You tell all the boys "No"
   Makes you feel good, yeah.
   I know you're out of my league
   But that won't scare me away, oh, no
   You've carried on so long,
   You couldn't stop if you tried it.
   You've built your wall so high
   That no one could climb it,
   But I'm gonna try.
   Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
   Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
   Take it off now, girl, take it off now, girl
   I wanna see inside
   Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?
   You let all the girls go
   Makes you feel good, don't it?
   Behind your Broadway show
   I heard a boy say, "Please, don't hurt me"
   You've carried on so long
   You couldn't stop if you tried it.
   You've built your wall so high
   That no one could climb it.
   But I'm gonna try.
   Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
   Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
   Take it off now, boy, take it off now, boy
   I wanna see inside
   Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight, oh, tonight?
   See beneath, see beneath,
   Tonight
   I'm gonna climb on top your ivory tower
   I'll hold your hand and then we'll jump right out
   We'll be falling, falling but that's OK
   'Cause I'll be right here
   I just wanna know
   Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
   Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
   Take it off now, girl, take it off now, girl
   'Cause I wanna see inside
   Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight, oh, oh, oh,
   tonight?
   See beneath your beautiful, oh, tonight.
   We ain't perfect, we ain't perfect, no.
   Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?  "
   Isn't that great? I love it! Did you listen to the song? If not, go
   look it up. It's a beautiful song. It was so underestimated when it was
   released, and I think that was such a mistake.

   You are so much stronger than you think. You don't even know how strong
   you are, and how strong you can become.
   You can do such great things.
   Someone somewhere loves you. And relies on you. You may not realize it
   now, but you bring a smile to people. You brought one to me when you
   decided to read this! (:
   But really, you might not realize how much you effect other people. It
   reminds me of the quote "People won't appreciate what you do until you
   quit doing it." The other people might not realize it until you're not
   able to be around them.
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-hiAPCo2-vBg%2FU-1niVXtlII%
   2FAAAAAAAAAIk%2F3fe-coMucXM%2Fs1600%2Fb0b6bb668531c07170c64dd3a65a6621.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*] So
   don"t count yourself out. Ever. EVER.
   This quote means a lot to me. It's one that I read as an insecure
   little teenage girl, crushing on some guy at school. Well, he was
   unable to realize that I liked him, and that I had something going for
   me. And I was crushed!
   That is- Until I ran across this quote. I thought I was just some
   person who wouldn't be able to get a boyfriend. Let me remind you this
   was years ago and my view on this has changed.
   But this quote is so true! You are great. You don't need someone else's
   justification or someone else to think you're amazing. You are. Just
   think about that. Take a minute to think how great you are.

   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-nguRWUXGlKk%2FU-1nhypO-cI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAIY%2FCF6vkBjOZik%2Fs1600%2Fac7adc7ac42fd2b70eda621d56031c6f.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   Do what scares you
   .
   Do things for yourself.
   Take time out of your busy schedule to appreciate thing that you do.
   Then you will be able to see how great you are.
   And how much other people appreciate you.
   And love you.
   Because they do.
   And I'm pretty sure I would if I actually got to know you. :)
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-b554F7U012E%2FU-1nhXY3QmI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAIU%2F5ytbKAVE8KM%2Fs1600%2F5cfb42cac636a5cbee02216afe4033c0.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   Okay, last thing I'll say is to love yourself. You truly need to!
   It's probably one of the hardest things you will ever have to do, but
   think about this.. How can you expect anyone else to love you if you
   don't love yourself?
   So I know its hard, but start loving yourself! :)

Reasons Why Young Actors Shouldn't Be Underestimated

   It's safe to say that ABC'S "Pretty Little Liars" is my favorite show
   ever. I stated that in my post, 10 Things About Me. If you haven't read
   it, go check it out! I want my readers to know me!
   Anyways! Since "Pretty Little Liars" is one of my favorite shows, I
   thought I would use the actors from it to show that young people aren't
   just stupid teenagers who are aging into adulthood. They actually might
   know something about the world and have something besides their acting
   skill to offer.
   My first point is that young actors know how it feels to be young and
   have pressure! That's what they deal with 24/7. They know how it feels
   and they know how it effects a person.
   My favorite quote from one of the "PLL" cast is this one said by Troian
   Bellisario who plays a teenager named Spencer.
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-AviNSCaRfZY%2FU-uMGYKJ-sI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAGw%2FwzGow2sRmLs%2Fs1600%2Fa8c4c61f1b8409e519ecc71cd08575be.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*] Isn't
   that quote great? It shows that she has had people trying to tell her
   who to be, and that she could see the value in being herself even when
   she's pressured to be something different.
   Maybe I'm the only person who would make the connection between this
   quote and her character, but on the show, Troian plays Spencer, the
   girl who is pressured by her parents to be perfect. In every way.
   School. Family. Sports. Friends. Her body. In every way possible, and
   she can't handle it. So maybe Troian Bellisario has learned from her
   character she plays that you dont have to be perfect, and it's okay to
   be you.
   I might be the only person who LOVES this quote. Maybe not.
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-LlxVPirMYtc%2FU-uMF0VFqaI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAGg%2FCEj0vrRqJqw%2Fs1600%2F49c544b9b9c6e2824e37fda0533c3638.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   The next quote that I feel shows that youer actors shouldn't be
   underestimated is by Ashley Benson. I like this one as well because it
   shows that she knows through playing her character Hanna, a girl who
   grows up as a chubbier child and the pressure of losing weight and
   being that "perfect" looking person.
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-RrjoRV2Zry8%2FU-uMFMSWUhI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAHM%2Ff8a8onnNT4c%2Fs1600%2F011372f83dcdb3bc51f9738c63afe356.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*]
   So as a slightly heavier person, I love that she put this quote out for
   the public to hear. So, I love this quote. I love that she says all you
   have to do is love yourself and you can be happy. I love that she can
   let people know that it's okay to be who they are and be imperfect.
   Another one that I really liked was this one by Lucy Hale, who plays
   Aria. I thought this quote was great. It really made me think. I'm my
   worst enemy and critic, so why would I want anyone else to do it too? I
   don't understand why we do it, but we all do. So how about we stop
   letting people get us down, and why don't we make the changes necessary
   to eliminate our critics? I know, it's easier said than done, but I
   think we should all try.
   [proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-PwLC_5sxRCQ%2FU-uMGJ_9FfI%
   2FAAAAAAAAAGo%2Fcy-Fh-4Fwtk%2Fs1600%2F665471abfa761dfa907e19b408d27603.
   jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*] As
   you can guess, I love this quote as well. Shay Mitchell tells it how it
   is. In her the way she portrays her character in the show, as well as
   in real life. I keep this quote in mind frequently, because somethings
   things do have to get worse before they can get better. And that's
   okay. And we need to realize this or life will be much harder than it
   should be.
   So the last thing I'm going to say in this post, is that younger people
   sometimes do know what they're talking about. And sometimes they do
   know a thing or two about life. So not every young teen actor should
   deserve a bad rep.
