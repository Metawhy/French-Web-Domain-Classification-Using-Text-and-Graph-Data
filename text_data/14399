   Wren Kitchens is the UK's number one kitchen retailer. We're proud to

   will continue over the next 10 years with expansion in the USA.
   Over the next 5 years - We plan to double the number of showrooms, and
   while our showrooms are the best in the business, ultimately; Wren is
   defined by its people.
   Wren is a self-funded, privately-owned, family-run business which is
   passionate about kitchens and delivering a world-class customer
   experience.
   Wren Kitchens do not lend from banks or financial institutions and has
   continuously shown significant growth year on year. In fact, Wren has
   grown at a rate of 30% each year since being set up in 2009.
   This has led to Wren being named not only as the fastest-growing
   retailer on the high street but the best place to work at too! more »

   high-impact Japanese graphic imagery with a British twist. Our products
   are characterised by quality fabrics with authentic vintage washes,
   unique detailing, world-leading hand-drawn graphics, and tailored fits
   with diverse styling. As we continue to develop the breadth and nature
   of our product ranges, we increasingly appeal to a broader group of
   customers, aspirational people who want to feel amazing in what they
   wear and appreciate style, quality and attention to detail.
   We operate a fast-growing multi-channel business through a combination
   of standalone stores, franchised and licensed stores, concessions,
   ecommerce, wholesale and distributors. We are growing fastest outside
   of the UK and our international business is going from strength to
   strength. We now own and operate stores in Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
   France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the USA,
   with franchised stores in many more countries. We have nearly 600
   points of sale in over 45 different countries and are adding to this at
   a rate of over 50 new locations annually. We have also entered a joint
   venture with Trendy International Group in China which will launch
   Superdry stores into the Chinese market.
   Our global headquarters are based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, UK
   and we have satellite offices in Aarhus, Barcelona, Brussels, Hong
   Kong, Munich and New York, with specialist sourcing offices in Istanbul
   and New Delhi with another due to open in early 2018 in Hong Kong. Our
   biggest growth area is online, where we operate ecommerce websites in
   over 20 different languages and ship to almost every country in the
   world.
   Our ambition for growth is summarised by our strategic plan which will
   provide opportunities to drive significant increases in revenue. Our
   plan focuses on three key areas - building a global lifestyle brand;
   driving awareness of the breadth of the Superdry range; and building a
   broad cross-channel relationship with customers. It&rsquo;s supported
   by the four key pillars of Embed, Enable, Extend and Execute, which
   define exactly how we will go about achieving our aims. As our product
   is at the very heart of what Superdry is all about, we are also
   focusing hard on our four key product attributes - design detail;
   quality obsession; innovation; and affordability. More about the detail
   of our strategic plan, together with our latest business and financial
   results, can be found on our corporate website www.supergroup.co.uk.
   We aspire to be a great place to work and strive every day to make
   every Superdry store and office location a friendly community with a
   family feel, with fantastic training and development, and roles that
   are compelling, stretching and interesting. more »
