Chalkboard signs~

   This window was broken, so I replaced the glass with a pieces of
   chalkboard.
   I had intended on just using it for messages, but I really do love
   having a black smooth surface for vinyl, so I turned it into a sign.  I
   guess it can still be used for little messages as well...perhaps
   sharing moments of our day that make us happy.

   This is another chalkboard sign. The frame is made out of barn wood.
   The inside edge was routed so the sign would fit nicely inside.

   This vinyl is for sale for $5+shipping if you'd like to recreate this
   project. It fits on a 9" square.
   And finally, a chalkboard that can actually be used as a chalkboard!
   This antique window was $2 at a garage sale.  I fell in love with the
   panels and the gorgeous original hardware.

Scrappy Headboard~

   A few years ago, I wanted to dress up our room a bit by making a
   headboard.
   I loved the look of oversized headboards, but I've never been a fan of
   the oversized price.
   To accomodate a tight decorating budget, I created the look of a large
   headboard
   by tacking trim to the wall and painting the inside.
   Really easy and pretty inexpensive.
   You can check out the post HERE.

   The only problem with this type of headboard is that you can't move it
   around.
   That can be a challenge for a girl who likes to change things up
   frequently.
   After a couple of years, it was time to add a bit more oomph.
   I raided the garage and found a bunch of scrap pieces of wood.
   I made sure they were all about 1/4'' thick, but I used all sorts of
   different kinds of scraps.
   Beadboard, pegboard, mdf, whatever I could find.
   I figured out the hard way that it was best to listen to my husbands
   suggestion and start at the top.
   All of the pieces in a horizontal row need to be the same width.
    They can and should be different lengths.
   Attach one horitontal row at a time and work your way down the wall.
   [headboard3.jpg]
   I tacked  the pieces up with a pnuematic nail gun.
   It took awhile... and the nail gun and compressor scared the crap out
   of my dog.
   She hid in my closet for the duration of the project.
   [headboard2.jpg]
   Here is a picture of the finished headboard.
   I love the new look! Clean and shabby at the same time.
   Feel free to try this at home.
   You just have to be happy with the fact that your bed will never ever
   ever move again...:)

Let's grow old together

   I listened to a talk this weekend about making your spouse the most
   important person in your life, only second to God.  It really touched
   my heart and made me question myself.  Am I giving my best time and
   attention and energy to my husband? Probably not. Can I improve? Most
   certainly.  Is it worth the effort? YES! I want to hold on to the love
   that we have. I want to make it stronger.  I want to grow old with my
   true love and share every part of my life with him.  I want to spend
   years creating our laugh lines together and when I look at my wrinkly
   self in the mirror, I want to smile and think of the memories we've
   shared and our future together.
