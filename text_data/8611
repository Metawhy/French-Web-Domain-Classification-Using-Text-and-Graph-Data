CERMICS

   CERMICS is the research center in applied mathematics at Ecole des
   Ponts ParisTech. It hosts joint project-teams with Inria Paris and
   University Marne-la-Vallée. The acronym CERMICS stands for “Centre
   d’Enseignement et de Recherche en MathématIques et Calcul
   Scientifique”, literally “Center for Training and Research in
   MathematIcs and Scientific Computing”.

   The research efforts are organized in three main streams: Applied
   Probability; Modeling, Analysis and Simulation; Optimization and
   Systems. The originality of the center resides in its capacity to build
   bridges between deterministic and stochastic approaches and to develop
   both theoretical and numerical methods.

   The center is presented (in French) in this video.
