   Finding Neverland

   …In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible
   summer.
   And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world
   pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something
   better, pushing right back.

   Finding Neverland

   …In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible
   summer.
   And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world
   pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something
   better, pushing right back.
   - quote by Albert Camus
   None of these pictures belong to me unless I state otherwise! If I have
   posted something of yours and did not credit you, please let me know
   and I will either attach your name to the photo or remove it, whatever
   you prefer
