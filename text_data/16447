Overfishing

Illegal Fishing

Bycatch

Habitat Damage

Management

   Roughly one-third of assessed fish populations are over-fished and over
   half are fully-fished.

The View From Below

   From above, it may seem that there are plenty of fish in the sea, but
   dive beneath the surface and it's a different story. Overfishing, lack
   of effective management, and our own consumption habits are just a few
   factors contributing to a decline in wild fish populations. Evidence of
   these problems abounds.

   In just the past decade, Atlantic populations of halibut and yellowtail
   flounder joined this list of species at all-time lows. The cod fishery,
   once a backbone of the North Atlantic economy, collapsed completely in
   the early 1990s and has shown little evidence of recovery two decades
   later. The breeding population of Pacific bluefin tuna is now at only
   four percent of its original size and decline will continue without
   significant, immediate management changes.

   Other harmful effects of fishing—some of which are preventable with
   modifications to gear—also impact the ocean, including the accidental
   catch of unwanted species (bycatch) and habitat damage from fishing
   gear.

What You Can Do

Use Our App

   The Seafood Watch app for Android and iPhone brings you up-to-date
   recommendations for ocean-friendly seafood and sushi.

Ask the Question: "Do You Sell Sustainable Seafood?"

   By asking this simple but important question at your grocery store or
   restaurant, you can help shape the demand for, and ultimately supply
   of, fish that's been caught or farmed in environmentally sustainable
   ways. Consumers play an important role in shaping ocean health, so
   start making a difference today!

How Did We Get Here?

   One reason is the advent of industrial-scale fishing, which began in
   the late 1800s and has been accompanied by significant declines in the
   size and abundance of fish. By the mid-1990s, these fishing practices
   made it impossible for natural fish stocks to keep up. Ninety percent
   of the world's fisheries are now fully exploited, over-exploited or
   have collapsed.

Out of Sight, Out of Mind?

   Because the ocean seems so vast and its resources limitless, these
   threats are often "out of sight, out of mind," but overfishing issues
   are not just for future generations to bear; they're very real problems
   threatening our current seafood supply and the health of our ocean. The
   good news is that there is much we can do—if we act now.
