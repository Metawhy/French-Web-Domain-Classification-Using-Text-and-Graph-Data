   When is the best time to visit Lisbon?

   Although it is not the best, winter could be a good time for tourists
   to visit Lisbon. From December to January, the temperature gets really
   low, and rain falls heavily. It makes the crowd density drops and many
   tourism spots deserted. But, many museums and historical buildings are
   still open for visitors. So, for those who want to spend their New Year
   holiday in chill climate, Lisbon would be a considerable choice.
   Besides, the flight and accommodation would be much cheaper.

   However, the most excellent time to visit Lisbon is during spring—from
   March to May. The average number of rainfalls drop significantly; the
   temperatures becomes more convenient to do outdoor activities: on
   average around 26o C. From late April to May, Lisbon has its beautiful
   phase with trees starting to blossom and flowers turning more colorful.


   What are the must-go places in Lisbon?
     * Castelo de São Jorge / St. George’s Castle

   As one of the major Lisbon’s panoramic attractions, St. George’s Castle
   is located in the perfect spot near Alfama. Just like a crown of the
   hill, the place stands as the most popular tourist destination in
   Lisbon. The castle has stunning battlements, engaging museum, and
   impressive archeological site for a family trip. From the observation
   terrace, visitors can enjoy the magnificent panoramic views of Lisbon.
     * Oceanário de Lisboa / The Lisbon Oceanarium

   As one of the largest aquariums in the world, Oceanário de Lisboa is
   considered as the friendly place for family visits. The oceanarium
   itself is the home of fish and marine animals, from different sizes and
   species. The magical sights come from the breathtaking undersea world
   behind the plexiglass. With an inventive design reflecting the four
   oceans—Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and the Antarctic, the oceanarium
   would make both kids and parents content.
     * Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga / The National Museum of Ancient Art

   Lisbon provides a great cultural entertainment through this museum.
   This must-go spot has the largest collection of paintings from the 15th
   to 16th century. The building is set over three levels. Level 1 is
   mostly filled with masterpieces from legendary painters. Art with
   jewelry, gold, silverware, and ceramic forms are placed on level 2.
   Meanwhile, at level 3, you will find Portuguese paintings and
   sculptures.
     * Padrão dos Descobrimentos / A Tribute to the Age of Discovery

   The monolith structure was built in 1960 for paying tribute to the
   500th anniversary of Henry the Navigator’s death. The design is
   intentionally made to appreciate those who were involved in the Golden
   Age of Discovery, such as Vasco da Gama, Fernão de Magalhães, and Pedro
   Álves Cabral. This extraordinary monument would be excellent for your
   historical trip.

   When is the best time to visit Lisbon?

   Although it is not the best, winter could be a good time for tourists
   to visit Lisbon. From December to January, the temperature gets really
   low, and rain falls heavily. It makes the crowd density drops and many
   tourism spots deserted. But, many museums and historical buildings are
   still open for visitors. So, for those who want to spend their New Year
   holiday in chill climate, Lisbon would be a considerable choice.
   Besides, the flight and accommodation would be much cheaper.

   However, the most excellent time to visit Lisbon is during spring—from
   March to May. The average number of rainfalls drop significantly; the
   temperatures becomes more convenient to do outdoor activities: on
   average around 26o C. From late April to May, Lisbon has its beautiful
   phase with trees starting to blossom and flowers turning more colorful.


   What are the must-go places in Lisbon?
     * Castelo de São Jorge / St. George’s Castle

   As one of the major Lisbon’s panoramic attractions, St. George’s Castle
   is located in the perfect spot near Alfama. Just like a crown of the
   hill, the place stands as the most popular tourist destination in
   Lisbon. The castle has stunning battlements, engaging museum, and
   impressive archeological site for a family trip. From the observation
   terrace, visitors can enjoy the magnificent panoramic views of Lisbon.
     * Oceanário de Lisboa / The Lisbon Oceanarium

   As one of the largest aquariums in the world, Oceanário de Lisboa is
   considered as the friendly place for family visits. The oceanarium
   itself is the home of fish and marine animals, from different sizes and
   species. The magical sights come from the breathtaking undersea world
   behind the plexiglass. With an inventive design reflecting the four
   oceans—Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and the Antarctic, the oceanarium
   would make both kids and parents content.
     * Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga / The National Museum of Ancient Art

   Lisbon provides a great cultural entertainment through this museum.
   This must-go spot has the largest collection of paintings from the 15th
   to 16th century. The building is set over three levels. Level 1 is
   mostly filled with masterpieces from legendary painters. Art with
   jewelry, gold, silverware, and ceramic forms are placed on level 2.
   Meanwhile, at level 3, you will find Portuguese paintings and
   sculptures.
     * Padrão dos Descobrimentos / A Tribute to the Age of Discovery

   The monolith structure was built in 1960 for paying tribute to the
   500th anniversary of Henry the Navigator’s death. The design is
   intentionally made to appreciate those who were involved in the Golden
   Age of Discovery, such as Vasco da Gama, Fernão de Magalhães, and Pedro
   Álves Cabral. This extraordinary monument would be excellent for your
   historical trip.
