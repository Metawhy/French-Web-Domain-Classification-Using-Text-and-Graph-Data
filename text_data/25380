What is Polyfill.io?

   It's a service which accepts a request for a set of browser features
   and returns only the polyfills that are needed by the requesting
   browser.

Why do I need it?

   There are lots of differing browsers and browser versions in use
   throughout the world, each one has a slighly different set of features
   to the rest. This can make developing for browsers a difficult task.
   The latest versions of the popular browsers can do lots of things which
   older browsers can not – but you may still have to support the older
   browsers. Polyfill.io makes it simpler to support differing browsers by
   attempting to recreate the missing features with polyfills: You can
   make use of the latest and greatest features in browsers which support
   them, and in those that do not.
