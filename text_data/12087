On-page SEO

   With the SeoTools for Excel add-in you get access to functions that are
   useful when working with online marketing. For on-page SEO analysis you
   have functions like HtmlH1, HtmlTitle and HtmlMetaDescription to verify
   that your pages are correctly setup.

Off-page SEO

   SeoTools also comes in handy when looking at off-page SEO factors. Use
   CheckBacklink to verify that your backlinks are still available.

Integrations

   SeoTools comes packed with integrations for your favorite services. Use
   the Google Analytics integration to build your own automated KPI
   reports or Majestic to analyze your backlink profile.

Connectors

   If you're missing something, it's easy to build your own Connector
   using our easy-to-use XML format to integrate with any external API or
   service.

Spider

   Channel the power of SeoTools Connectors into a page crawler. Simply
   supply the Spider with a list of urls or just a root url - it takes
   care of the rest.

Other Tools

   Excel is an invaluable tool for any online marketer but some features
   are missing. SeoTools provides you with over 100 helper functions like
   XPathOnUrl, RegexpFind, DomainAge, SpinText and UrlProperty.

Pull social metrics for multiple accounts

by Niels Bosma

   Socialmedia

   We often get this question: How can I pull social metrics for multiple
   twitter/facebook/linkedin accounts at a time? Instead of having to

   formula and then replace the literal url with a reference to the first
   cell in the column of urls. Then use Excel's autofill feature to
   populate the rest of the cells....

   function in SeoTools 5.0. MD5 which stands for Message Digest algorithm
