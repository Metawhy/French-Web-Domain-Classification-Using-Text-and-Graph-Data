   Directed by David Lynch stickers let you add the ‘bizarre’ to your
   everyday objects and surroundings.

   Does your life need more David Lynch? Put a sticker on the cover of
   your secret diary and pages may start to disappear. Stick one to your
   front door and mysterious VHS tapes could end up on your porch. Apply a
   sticker to the trunk of your car to warn drivers you’re on a joyride
   with Frank Booth. Put Directed by David Lynch stickers on your laptop,
   bicycle, window, notebook, locker, cans of creamed corn, damn good
   coffee machine, or simply in the middle of your television screen while
   binge-watching Twin Peaks! In any case, Welcome to Twin Peaks is not
   responsible for any consequences both wonderful and strange.

   A spin-off of the Directed by David Lynch sweatshirt and Directed by
   David Lynch t-shirt, these stickers measure 4.59″ by 1.41″, have
   durable UV lamination and transparent spacing around the letters.
   Available per 5 (includes 2 free stickers) or 10 (includes 5 free

   More unofficial Twin Peaks merchandise, folks! Here’s the Meals On
   Wheels tote bag, as used by Laura Palmer and Donna Hayward while
   delivering food to the shut-ins of Twin Peaks, like Harold Smith, Mrs.
   Tremond and her magician grandson, Pierre.

   Meals On Wheels tote bag

   Now tell me… Do you see creamed corn on that plate?

   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAwOy-h6h4

   From Laura Palmer’s diary:

     I’ve been meaning to tell you what became of my meeting with Norma.
     I had been thinking about the very best way to help the elderly who
     find it difficult to leave the house. I would deliver meals to the
     elderly people in the area who couldn’t get out for a hot meal. I
     told her the name of the program could be Meals on Wheels. Norma
     loved the idea and said she would make a few calls to people at city
     hall and maybe the hospital. We could find the best recipients that
     way, without doing much footwork. Norma agreed to provide the meals,
     two a day, four times a week. All profits to go fifty-fifty. I
     deliver them to the door, and maybe I’ll regain some confidence… Or
     am I confident? Or am I so fucked up on coke that I can’t tell?

   The logo was meticulously based on the stickers seen on the food plate
   covers in the Twin Peaks Double R Diner.
