   Doctoral Candidate in Social/Personality Psychology
   Positive Activities & Well-Being Lab
   University of California, Riverside
   My research focuses broadly on the who, what, where, when, why and how
   of happiness. I investigate the architecture of subjective well-being,
   including its outcomes (e.g., positive emotions), mechanisms (e.g.,
   social connectedness), moderators (e.g., culture), and downstream
   consequences (e.g., career success). To explore these questions, I
   often employ positive activity interventions designed to enhance
   well-being, such as expressing gratitude, performing acts of kindness,
   and engaging in flow activities. I am currently working towards my
   Ph.D. at the University of California, Riverside with Dr. Sonja
   Lyubomirsky in the Positive Activities and Well-Being (PAW) Laboratory.
   Some of my current and past research explores:
     * How technology impacts well-being
     * Whether happiness precedes and leads to career success
     * Sharing gratitude within dynamic social networks
     * The health benefits of engaging in prosocial behavior
     * Whether gratitude can motivate self-improvement
     * Creating an intervention to boost state humility
     * Engaging in flow activities while awaiting uncertain news​
