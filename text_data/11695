   What people are saying
   Lorenzo Brown
   “I feel so accomplished. I did two Haute Route events prior to this. I
   did the Pyrenees and I did the Alps and every time I went home my legs
   were like ‘let’s go, let’s go’. It was amazing so I felt like I knew
   that I could do the double.”

   Lorenzo Brown

   Experienced Rider
   Brooke Mead
   “There is nothing like the Haute Route. It has been the highlight of
   our year with my husband, hands down. It is a really unique thing – a
   true team experience for us."

   Brooke Mead

   Experienced Rider
   Alexander Bobkov
   “We lived three fabulous days, the best days of my life, I have to say,
   because all my previous competitions, half-marathons, marathons,
   half-Ironman, I think helped me for this competition. This is the next
   step. I am really proud of us for this achievement.”
