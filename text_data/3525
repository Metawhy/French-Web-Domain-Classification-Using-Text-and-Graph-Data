   The Tiger Shark is a species of requiem shark and the only extant
   member of the genus Galeocerdo. It is a large macropredator, capable of
   attaining a length over 5 m (16 ft 5 in).  Populations are found in
   many tropical and temperate waters, especially around central Pacific
   islands. Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body, which
   resemble a tiger’s pattern, but fade as the shark matures.

   photos by marine biologist thomas peschak of whale sharks in the gulf
   of tadjoura, djibouti. his latest book, “sharks and people: exploring
   our relationship with the most feared fish in the sea,” was released
   last year.

   as thomas notes, whale sharks are docile, slow moving filter feeders
   that feed by drifting with their capacious mouths open, drawing in
   plankton, fish, and small crustaceans. but foreign objects, such as
   plastic, can also be drawn into the shark’s digestive system, causing
   them harm.

   whale sharks, the largest non mammalian vertebrates on the planet,
   originated some sixty million years ago, but are now listed as a
   vulnerable species, coming under particular threat from boat propellers
   and pollution. they are also hunted for their fins, though the u.a.e.
   banned the shark fin trade in 2008

   Fisher by Michel_Rathwell

   letsgowild

   Fisher is the common name for a largely arboreal, North American
   carnivorous mammal.  Despite its name, this animal seldom eats fish. It
   is a weasel of the Mustelidae family.

   With its speed and agility, the fisher is a remarkable predator that
   captures a wide diversity of prey: Rabbits, hares, squirrels, mice,
   grouse, and so forth. Even the well-protected porcupine is captured by
   the fisher, using a unique technique designed to tire the porcupine
   until the fisher can kill the large quilled rodent.

   The Fisher is a top predator.  For thousands of years the dense,
   lustrous coat of the fisher has been prized.
