   The DisInsider has exclusively learned new details about Mulan‘s
   live-action adaptation – which is currently in post-production. We
   reported several months back that the film will feature some of the
   music from the animated classic and that Mushu would be appearing, but
   Disney has decided to go in a new direction regarding those decisions.

   A source close to us that has seen the film reports that a phoenix
   replaced Mulan’s beloved sidekick Mushu, and that while music from the
   animated film will be included in the remake, the songs will not be
   sung by the cast as the music is just instrumentals. As time
   progresses, Disney will very likely use test screenings to gauge what
   changes – if any – need to be made via reshoots and post-production.

     Here is something that may officially confirm our story! Look at the
     sweaters the cast is wearing! https://t.co/RBHEHoBXlA

   Mulan is the epic adventure of a fearless young woman who masquerades
   as a man in order to fight Northern Invaders attacking China. The
   eldest daughter of an honored warrior, Hua Mulan is spirited,
   determined and quick on her feet. When the Emperor issues a decree that
   one man per family must serve in the Imperial Army, she steps in to
   take the place of her ailing father as Hua Jun, becoming one of China’s
   greatest warriors ever.

   Directed by Niki Caro, Mulan will star Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An,
   Utkarsh Ambudkar, Ron Yuan, Tzi Ma, Rosalind Chao, Cheng Pei-Pei,
   Nelson Lee, Chum Ehelepola, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, and Gong Li.
