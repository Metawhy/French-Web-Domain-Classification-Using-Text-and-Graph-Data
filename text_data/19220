Linda van der Veen

   PhD, Technical Physician / Physicist
   Dept. of Nuclear Medicine at the Netherlands Cancer Institute

   We have selected PLANET® Dose platform as the most comprehensive
   solution on the market, matching with our short-term needs and future
   requirements to support new radionuclide-based therapies. PLANET® Dose
   is a versatile platform, giving us many options and tools to go from
   current pre-clinical wide studies to future customized clinical
   workflows.

Olivier Morin

   PhD, Clinical Instructor
   Division of Physics, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of
   California, San Francisco, USA

   EPIgray was a simple and integrated solution dedicated to in vivo
   dosimetry for our 3DCRT and IMRT treatments. Data acquisition with the
   electronic portal imager and model implementation were fast and the
   validation was very successful for our cases of interest. The web-based
   approach is much appreciated.

   PhD, Chief Physicist
   Radiation Therapy Department, Grand Hôpital of Charleroi, Gilly,
   BELGIUM

   MU2net was simple to set up and great to use for a daily routine. Its
   user interface is intuitive. To adjust the calculation, MU2net offers
   the possibility of assigning a density different than 1 to the
   structures. This enables it to take into account the lungs, for
   example. We have used MU2net for more than 200 VMAT cases. Most of the
   time when the calculation point is in a low gradient dose area, we got
   less than 3 % deviation.
