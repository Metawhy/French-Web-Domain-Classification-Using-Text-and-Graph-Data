   Alibaba today announced the launch of DT PAI, a new service in its
   Aliyun public cloud that will be able to handle machine learning
   processes.

   Aliyun will launch a free public trial of the service for a select
   group of early users in the next few weeks, DT PAI product manager Xiao
   Wei told VentureBeat in an email.

   “DTPAI contains matured and advanced ML algorithms whose effectiveness
   are verified by Alibaba’s profound data scenarios in Taobao, Tmall or
   Alipay business,” Wei wrote. The service can deal with workloads such
   as classification, clustering, feature abstraction, and large-scale
   statistics, he wrote. The service will even be able to perform an
   increasingly popular type of artificial intelligence known as deep
   learning.

   When it comes to logistic regression, a type of statistical model, DT
   PAI “can process data with 10 billion plus dimensions of features and
   100 billion plus of records,” Wei wrote.

   It’s not surprising to see Alibaba expand its cloud like this. Amazon
   Web Services and Microsoft Azure have both released cloud services for
   machine learning in the past year. And Alibaba is quickly revving up to
   match the capabilities of those public clouds. Last month, Aliyun
   announced plans to add graphic processing units (GPUs) and solid state
   drives (SSDs), and Alibaba also committed to spending $1 billion to
   expand Aliyun in Japan, Europe and the Middle East.

   Alibaba is indeed based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, far from the
   West Coast, where Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are based. But the
   company is obviously looking to expand its business outside of China.

   “We are happy to serve users worldwide and we support English,” Wei
   wrote.

Facebook has more than 5 million advertisers, with 75% from outside the U.S.

   Francisco on April 12, 2016.

   Facebook marks another milestone in helping businesses reach new
   customers. The social media company announced today that it now counts
   more than 5 million active advertisers, a 1 million increase in the
   past seven months. Three quarters of these advertisers are outside the
   U.S., and the biggest verticals are ecommerce, entertainment and media,
   and retail.

   To further adoption by small and medium-sized businesses, Facebook is
   launching new tools and resources, including providing one-click
   options to reinstate high-performing ads within Ads Manager, opening
   a single inbox to the desktop, creating a “studio” to help businesses
   build ads using a mobile device, and expanding its small business
   council.

Helping small businesses navigate mobile

   While Facebook is celebrating its 5 million advertiser milestone, that
   still only accounts for around 8 percent of the 65 million businesses
   that have a presence on the social network. Katherine Shappley, the
   company’s director overseeing SMBs in North America, acknowledged that
   there’s a delta between these figures, but said that there’s a “big
   opportunity for Facebook to put out the right solutions to help
   advertisers find that their investment works on the platform and
   they’re growing their business.” She believes that when small
   businesses are able to succeed, communities will thrive — which is a
   core focus of Facebook.

   Shappley cited the founder letter recently penned by company chief
   executive Mark Zuckerberg, highlighting Facebook’s commitment to
   supporting infrastructure to build global communities and further
   positive impact around the world. “Small businesses are a vital part of
   those communities,” she said. “With 65 million business Pages on
   Facebook and 8 million profiles on Instagram, we have the privilege of
   connecting the largest online small business community globally.”

   However, she didn’t deny that more needed to be done to help businesses
   on the platform. “Privileges comes with responsibility. If you think
   about it, technology has created amazing opportunities for people and
   small businesses, but it can also be challenging for small businesses
   when you think about limited time and resources when trying to reach
   new customers when every consumer is reaching for their phone,”
   Shappley said. “We really want to empower those small businesses to
   embrace the mobile world.”

Nearly half of all Facebook advertisers use mobile

   Nearly 50 percent of Facebook’s 5 million advertisers are creating ads
   on mobile devices. And in order for the company to increase adoption,
   and in the process shore up additional revenue opportunities, it has to
   provide marketers with the tools and resources needed to switch over.

   For those already creating ads on mobile, the company has updated its
   Ads Manager app to speed up the process. “We heard from small
   businesses that they want robust ad management capabilities on mobile,”
   Shappley said. Among the newest features is the addition of a one-click
   option allowing marketers to reinstate high-performing ads. Facebook
   has also expanded the interest types that can be targeted and given
   businesses the ability to compare ads. The company is also now going to
   suggest actions that can be taken to improve ad performance.

   In November, Facebook launched a new inbox experience for businesses
   that consolidated messages across the social network, Instagram, and
   Messenger. The feature was initially constrained to mobile devices, but
   now Single Inbox is being expanded to the desktop so marketers can
   manage their relationship with customers on a laptop, tablet, or
   smartphone.

   Facebook has also launched a way for businesses to target globally,
   instead of just thinking locally. Now there are cross-border tools that
   can be used to connect a business with people in other countries. The
   first is “international lookalikes,” which matches marketers with
   people in new countries who resemble the company’s best customers. The
   second is worldwide region targeting that pairs campaigns with the most
   efficient conversions. Lastly, businesses can create customized
   campaigns in each country through country snapshots and an insights
   playbook.

   “As a small business, you’re worried about starting from scratch, and
   it’s time-intensive, especially for the one that has 1 to 2 hours
   dedicated to marketing,” Shappley explained. “Facebook will show you
   the optimal people to target in those countries.”

   Some small businesses may be more interested in education, which is why
   the social media company is launching Mobile Studio, a place for
   marketers to discover ways to create ads using a mobile device. The
   site has tips on remixing, shooting from scratch, and more. Shappley
   described this service as a “celebration of how to make great creative
   on mobile. Not only is it showcasing what we have natively, [it is
   sharing] how to use the apps that are free or relatively inexpensive to
   create something very compelling.” She believes Mobile Studio will be
   inspirational for small businesses.

   To help connect small businesses with one another while also keeping
   each other apprised of issues they go through, Facebook set up several
   small business councils. Currently, there are four around the world —
   in the United States, India, Brazil, and Germany — but to expand the
   reach of these groups, Facebook is launching websites to tell their
   stories. Today, the company launched the first one for the U.S. This
   will highlight 40 small businesses and look at how they used Facebook
   to reach their communities and customers.

   There are plans to expand the small business councils to other
   countries later this year.

   Finally, Facebook has released numbers around its Blueprint online
   courses, which provide education around advertising on the social
   network and related properties. More than 2.5 million courses have been
   taken from more than 1 million people across 150 countries, half of
   them small businesses. Shappley stated that new courses are going to be
   added soon, including courses around how to monetize video, make
   copyright correction on the platform, and more.

   “We couldn’t be more excited about small businesses. The company is
   rallying around to make sure we have the solutions for this segment.
   We’re highly motivated about the stories coming from small businesses,”
   Shappley said. “The biggest part of the announcement is that we’re
   continuing to create solutions for [them]. This will certainly not be
   the last announcement in that ongoing commitment.”

Google is building YouTube Connect, a livestreaming app to take on Periscope

     Ken Yeung
   4 years ago

   Google has quietly been building a new livestreaming app called YouTube
   Connect, VentureBeat has learned. This service highlights the company’s
   efforts to double down on live video while also placing it in a
   position to compete directly against Twitter’s Periscope and Facebook
   Live. YouTube Connect will be available on both iOS and Android
   devices.

   Google did not immediately respond for comment.

   YouTube Connect has much of the same functionality that you’d already
   find with Periscope and Facebook Live, according to a source close to
   the matter. You can log into the app using your Google or YouTube
   account and immediately begin streaming from your mobile phone. There
   are chat and tagging features, and a “news feed” that features the
   latest clips from your friends or those that you’ve subscribed to on
   YouTube.

   Videos will be viewable live within the app, as well as on the YouTube
   site in their respective channels. It will also be possible to store
   previous broadcasts in the app, quite possibly as something you can opt
   into after you’ve completed the live stream. This will make it possible
   for you and your friends to watch the replays. The app does not yet
   have the integrations with Facebook or Twitter that would make it easy
   for users to share live streams on other social networks.

   YouTube Connect comes at a time when Google has fallen behind in the
   livestreaming space, having lost ground to apps like Periscope, Meerkat
   — which recently pivoted — and Facebook Live. YouTube does offer
   livestreaming, through its Creator Studio offering, but it’s limited in
   terms of access. Now this new app could open the capability to a much
   larger audience.

   In an interview with Wired, Manual Bronstein, the company’s head of
   product for consumers, said that “Broadly speaking, we think about
   YouTube being synonymous with video…live has always been a part of
   video, and it’s actually always a very exciting part.”

   A livestreaming app makes sense when thinking about future directions
   for YouTube, a platform that houses the world’s collection of
   user-generated videos. Giving content creators the ability to interact
   with their fans in real time while on the red carpet or at a major
   event is valuable — why ask them to slink off to create videos that are
   posted on Facebook or on Twitter?

   Both Twitter and Facebook have invested quite a bit in livestreaming
   events. During Twitter’s Q4 2015 earnings call, as CEO Jack Dorsey
   highlighted his vision for the company, he indicated Periscope’s
   importance — he’s even added the service’s CEO to his executive team.
   Dorsey: “Twitter is live, live commentary, live conversations, and live
   connections, whether it’s breaking news, entertainment, sports, or
   everyday topics, hearing about and watching a live event unfold is the
   fastest way to understand the power of Twitter.”

   Mark Zuckerberg also shared that Facebook’s livestreaming option is
   something he’s “excited about.” It’ll likely grow in popularity as more
   people gain access to it.

   YouTube has been losing a bit of its luster against these growing
   services, particularly Facebook and Snapchat — both of which have been
   in the news over the past few months as their video-viewing numbers
   continue to expand. In February, Snapchat reached 8 billion videos
   viewed, bringing it nearly equal to Facebook. If YouTube wants to pick
   up its viewership, a livestreaming app is a logical way to go.

   YouTube Connect would be the latest standalone app in the YouTube
   family, joining not only the core service, but also YouTube Capture —
   which allows you to record and edit footage right on the mobile device
   — and YouTube Gaming.

   Although timing for the release has not been divulged, a launch before
   Google’s I/O developer conference in May seems likely. It also wouldn’t
   be farfetched to think that the company might unveil the app with its
   YouTube stars, just like Facebook did with its livestreaming option —
   getting the biggest names on board to lead the way.

   Updated: YouTube launched its livestreaming service right from its app
   in June

   Ten-year-old Donovan Romero-Brathwaite has quite an imagination, and he
   has applied it to designing his first video game, a whimsical title
   called Gunman Taco Truck.

   If he was like most kids, his vision might have ended with a pat on the
   back after he told his parents his idea. But his folks are legendary
   game designers Brenda Romero, who worked on Wizardry, and John Romero,
   one of the people behind Doom. Games are the family business.
   Gunman Taco Truck was designed by 10-year-old Donovan
   Brathwaite-Romero.

   Donovan came up with the idea during a coding lesson with his
   stepfather, John. His mother, Brenda, used her smartphone to record
   Donovan describing his idea. Then, she posted the video on Facebook, in
   which Donovan rocks back and forth with excitement as he talks about
   the plot of Gunman Taco Truck, which involves a heavily armored and
   weaponized taco truck.

   Brenda said in an interview with GamesBeat, “Within a short matter of
   time, a bunch of game developers were saying, ‘Well, you’re going to
   make it aren’t you?'”

   They decided to do it and assembled a team of six people, made up
   of family and friends. Donovan’s sisters are testing the game. His
   brother Michael is helping, as are his parents. A few friends — Paul
   Conway, Dren McDonald, and Ian Dunbar — are rounding out the work on
   the art and other details.
   Romero family and friends: Michael, John, Brenda, and Donovan.

   Romero, Donovan Romero-Brathwaite, and Michael Romero.

   “We’ve got more people on this than most indie games,” John said in an
   interview.

   They’ve made enough progress to put the game up for pre-order on the
   Humble Store, which devotes 10 percent of proceeds to charity.

   The title’s story is set after an apocalypse, where a scientist
   accidentally set off seven atomic bombs and wiped out most of the
   population. The “last Mexican in the U.S.” is one of the people left
   standing. A bunch of mutant creatures have emerged and are attacking
   the survivors. The taco truck driver tries to feed those who are still
   alive, but he has to heavily arm his taco truck in order to deal with
   the mutants.

   “Your goal is to get the taco truck to Canada,” Donovan told me.

   Donovan got the idea last summer. With help from his stepdad, he
   created a design document. It described the plot and had drawings of
   the artwork. It also outlined weapons, creatures, and locations. He
   completed the document in November, and development began in December
   using the Corona software development kit.

   “We’re fortunate that we have family and friends to take advantage of
   his idea and make it a reality,” Brenda said. “He has a good
   environment. He [is surrounded] by games all of the time. He’s probably
   at a stage of skill now where I was in my early 20s.”

   The Romeros got an artist to start working on the imagery. While all of
   the design is Donovan’s, Brenda is working on balancing the game.
   Players will experience 40 locations and a bunch of monsters, including
   a devil chicken (who clearly doesn’t want to be part of a taco). The
   chicken shoots “dark matter” from its beak and lasers from its eyes.

   “The final draft of the design is absolutely ridiculous,” Brenda said.

   The team completed an alpha version, which is ready for testing.
   Donovan did the coding for the introduction screens. He’s learning
   about game-development milestones and how to work with the family as a
   team.

   They are hoping for a June release on iOS. John said he met with Apple,
   and the company was excited about it. Any proceeds will go toward
   Donovan’s college fund, and the title will ship with his hand-drawn
   design doc.

   Donovan said his creative side comes from the games he plays or
   watches. He was inspired to see his mother win an award at the recent
   Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco. In front of a crowd
   of thousands, she accepted the honors for the Ambassador Award. Donovan
   wants to return to the GDC and win an award himself one day.

   “He wanted to be a game developer since he was maybe seven,” Brenda
   said. “But we thought he had to master reading first. We thought it
   would be a great exercise to learn coding and design a game while doing
   that.”

Alibaba’s Aliyun cloud launches DT PAI, an artificial intelligence service

   4 years ago

   Alibaba today announced the launch of DT PAI, a new service in its
   Aliyun public cloud that will be able to handle machine learning
   processes.

   Aliyun will launch a free public trial of the service for a select
   group of early users in the next few weeks, DT PAI product manager Xiao
   Wei told VentureBeat in an email.

   “DTPAI contains matured and advanced ML algorithms whose effectiveness
   are verified by Alibaba’s profound data scenarios in Taobao, Tmall or
   Alipay business,” Wei wrote. The service can deal with workloads such
   as classification, clustering, feature abstraction, and large-scale
   statistics, he wrote. The service will even be able to perform an
   increasingly popular type of artificial intelligence known as deep
   learning.

   When it comes to logistic regression, a type of statistical model, DT
   PAI “can process data with 10 billion plus dimensions of features and
   100 billion plus of records,” Wei wrote.

   It’s not surprising to see Alibaba expand its cloud like this. Amazon
   Web Services and Microsoft Azure have both released cloud services for
   machine learning in the past year. And Alibaba is quickly revving up to
   match the capabilities of those public clouds. Last month, Aliyun
   announced plans to add graphic processing units (GPUs) and solid state
   drives (SSDs), and Alibaba also committed to spending $1 billion to
   expand Aliyun in Japan, Europe and the Middle East.

   Alibaba is indeed based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, far from the
   West Coast, where Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are based. But the
   company is obviously looking to expand its business outside of China.

   “We are happy to serve users worldwide and we support English,” Wei
   wrote.

Facebook has more than 5 million advertisers, with 75% from outside the U.S.

     Ken Yeung
   2 years ago

   Francisco on April 12, 2016.

   Facebook marks another milestone in helping businesses reach new
   customers. The social media company announced today that it now counts
   more than 5 million active advertisers, a 1 million increase in the
   past seven months. Three quarters of these advertisers are outside the
   U.S., and the biggest verticals are ecommerce, entertainment and media,
   and retail.

   To further adoption by small and medium-sized businesses, Facebook is
   launching new tools and resources, including providing one-click
   options to reinstate high-performing ads within Ads Manager, opening
   a single inbox to the desktop, creating a “studio” to help businesses
   build ads using a mobile device, and expanding its small business
   council.

Helping small businesses navigate mobile

   While Facebook is celebrating its 5 million advertiser milestone, that
   still only accounts for around 8 percent of the 65 million businesses
   that have a presence on the social network. Katherine Shappley, the
   company’s director overseeing SMBs in North America, acknowledged that
   there’s a delta between these figures, but said that there’s a “big
   opportunity for Facebook to put out the right solutions to help
   advertisers find that their investment works on the platform and
   they’re growing their business.” She believes that when small
   businesses are able to succeed, communities will thrive — which is a
   core focus of Facebook.

   Shappley cited the founder letter recently penned by company chief
   executive Mark Zuckerberg, highlighting Facebook’s commitment to
   supporting infrastructure to build global communities and further
   positive impact around the world. “Small businesses are a vital part of
   those communities,” she said. “With 65 million business Pages on
   Facebook and 8 million profiles on Instagram, we have the privilege of
   connecting the largest online small business community globally.”

   However, she didn’t deny that more needed to be done to help businesses
   on the platform. “Privileges comes with responsibility. If you think
   about it, technology has created amazing opportunities for people and
   small businesses, but it can also be challenging for small businesses
   when you think about limited time and resources when trying to reach
   new customers when every consumer is reaching for their phone,”
   Shappley said. “We really want to empower those small businesses to
   embrace the mobile world.”

Nearly half of all Facebook advertisers use mobile

   Nearly 50 percent of Facebook’s 5 million advertisers are creating ads
   on mobile devices. And in order for the company to increase adoption,
   and in the process shore up additional revenue opportunities, it has to
   provide marketers with the tools and resources needed to switch over.

   For those already creating ads on mobile, the company has updated its
   Ads Manager app to speed up the process. “We heard from small
   businesses that they want robust ad management capabilities on mobile,”
   Shappley said. Among the newest features is the addition of a one-click
   option allowing marketers to reinstate high-performing ads. Facebook
   has also expanded the interest types that can be targeted and given
   businesses the ability to compare ads. The company is also now going to
   suggest actions that can be taken to improve ad performance.

   In November, Facebook launched a new inbox experience for businesses
   that consolidated messages across the social network, Instagram, and
   Messenger. The feature was initially constrained to mobile devices, but
   now Single Inbox is being expanded to the desktop so marketers can
   manage their relationship with customers on a laptop, tablet, or
   smartphone.

   Facebook has also launched a way for businesses to target globally,
   instead of just thinking locally. Now there are cross-border tools that
   can be used to connect a business with people in other countries. The
   first is “international lookalikes,” which matches marketers with
   people in new countries who resemble the company’s best customers. The
   second is worldwide region targeting that pairs campaigns with the most
   efficient conversions. Lastly, businesses can create customized
   campaigns in each country through country snapshots and an insights
   playbook.

   “As a small business, you’re worried about starting from scratch, and
   it’s time-intensive, especially for the one that has 1 to 2 hours
   dedicated to marketing,” Shappley explained. “Facebook will show you
   the optimal people to target in those countries.”

   Above: Facebook’s Mobile Studio

   Some small businesses may be more interested in education, which is why
   the social media company is launching Mobile Studio, a place for
   marketers to discover ways to create ads using a mobile device. The
   site has tips on remixing, shooting from scratch, and more. Shappley
   described this service as a “celebration of how to make great creative
   on mobile. Not only is it showcasing what we have natively, [it is
   sharing] how to use the apps that are free or relatively inexpensive to
   create something very compelling.” She believes Mobile Studio will be
   inspirational for small businesses.

   To help connect small businesses with one another while also keeping
   each other apprised of issues they go through, Facebook set up several
   small business councils. Currently, there are four around the world —
   in the United States, India, Brazil, and Germany — but to expand the
   reach of these groups, Facebook is launching websites to tell their
   stories. Today, the company launched the first one for the U.S. This
   will highlight 40 small businesses and look at how they used Facebook
   to reach their communities and customers.

   There are plans to expand the small business councils to other
   countries later this year.

   Finally, Facebook has released numbers around its Blueprint online
   courses, which provide education around advertising on the social
   network and related properties. More than 2.5 million courses have been
   taken from more than 1 million people across 150 countries, half of
   them small businesses. Shappley stated that new courses are going to be
   added soon, including courses around how to monetize video, make
   copyright correction on the platform, and more.

   “We couldn’t be more excited about small businesses. The company is
   rallying around to make sure we have the solutions for this segment.
   We’re highly motivated about the stories coming from small businesses,”
   Shappley said. “The biggest part of the announcement is that we’re
   continuing to create solutions for [them]. This will certainly not be
   the last announcement in that ongoing commitment.”

Google is building YouTube Connect, a livestreaming app to take on Periscope

     Ken Yeung
   4 years ago
   Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat

   Google has quietly been building a new livestreaming app called YouTube
   Connect, VentureBeat has learned. This service highlights the company’s
   efforts to double down on live video while also placing it in a
   position to compete directly against Twitter’s Periscope and Facebook
   Live. YouTube Connect will be available on both iOS and Android
   devices.

   Google did not immediately respond for comment.

   YouTube Connect has much of the same functionality that you’d already
   find with Periscope and Facebook Live, according to a source close to
   the matter. You can log into the app using your Google or YouTube
   account and immediately begin streaming from your mobile phone. There
   are chat and tagging features, and a “news feed” that features the
   latest clips from your friends or those that you’ve subscribed to on
   YouTube.

   Videos will be viewable live within the app, as well as on the YouTube
   site in their respective channels. It will also be possible to store
   previous broadcasts in the app, quite possibly as something you can opt
   into after you’ve completed the live stream. This will make it possible
   for you and your friends to watch the replays. The app does not yet
   have the integrations with Facebook or Twitter that would make it easy
   for users to share live streams on other social networks.

   YouTube Connect comes at a time when Google has fallen behind in the
   livestreaming space, having lost ground to apps like Periscope, Meerkat
   — which recently pivoted — and Facebook Live. YouTube does offer
   livestreaming, through its Creator Studio offering, but it’s limited in
   terms of access. Now this new app could open the capability to a much
   larger audience.

   In an interview with Wired, Manual Bronstein, the company’s head of
   product for consumers, said that “Broadly speaking, we think about
   YouTube being synonymous with video…live has always been a part of
   video, and it’s actually always a very exciting part.”

   A livestreaming app makes sense when thinking about future directions
   for YouTube, a platform that houses the world’s collection of
   user-generated videos. Giving content creators the ability to interact
   with their fans in real time while on the red carpet or at a major
   event is valuable — why ask them to slink off to create videos that are
   posted on Facebook or on Twitter?

   Both Twitter and Facebook have invested quite a bit in livestreaming
   events. During Twitter’s Q4 2015 earnings call, as CEO Jack Dorsey
   highlighted his vision for the company, he indicated Periscope’s
   importance — he’s even added the service’s CEO to his executive team.
   Dorsey: “Twitter is live, live commentary, live conversations, and live
   connections, whether it’s breaking news, entertainment, sports, or
   everyday topics, hearing about and watching a live event unfold is the
   fastest way to understand the power of Twitter.”

   Mark Zuckerberg also shared that Facebook’s livestreaming option is
   something he’s “excited about.” It’ll likely grow in popularity as more
   people gain access to it.

   YouTube has been losing a bit of its luster against these growing
   services, particularly Facebook and Snapchat — both of which have been
   in the news over the past few months as their video-viewing numbers
   continue to expand. In February, Snapchat reached 8 billion videos
   viewed, bringing it nearly equal to Facebook. If YouTube wants to pick
   up its viewership, a livestreaming app is a logical way to go.

   YouTube Connect would be the latest standalone app in the YouTube
   family, joining not only the core service, but also YouTube Capture —
   which allows you to record and edit footage right on the mobile device
   — and YouTube Gaming.

   Although timing for the release has not been divulged, a launch before
   Google’s I/O developer conference in May seems likely. It also wouldn’t
   be farfetched to think that the company might unveil the app with its
   YouTube stars, just like Facebook did with its livestreaming option —
   getting the biggest names on board to lead the way.

   Updated: YouTube launched its livestreaming service right from its app
   in June

   Ten-year-old Donovan Romero-Brathwaite has quite an imagination, and he
   has applied it to designing his first video game, a whimsical title
   called Gunman Taco Truck.

   If he was like most kids, his vision might have ended with a pat on the
   back after he told his parents his idea. But his folks are legendary
   game designers Brenda Romero, who worked on Wizardry, and John Romero,
   one of the people behind Doom. Games are the family business.
   Gunman Taco Truck was designed by 10-year-old Donovan
   Brathwaite-Romero.

   Donovan came up with the idea during a coding lesson with his
   stepfather, John. His mother, Brenda, used her smartphone to record
   Donovan describing his idea. Then, she posted the video on Facebook, in
   which Donovan rocks back and forth with excitement as he talks about
   the plot of Gunman Taco Truck, which involves a heavily armored and
   weaponized taco truck.

   Brenda said in an interview with GamesBeat, “Within a short matter of
   time, a bunch of game developers were saying, ‘Well, you’re going to
   make it aren’t you?'”

   They decided to do it and assembled a team of six people, made up
   of family and friends. Donovan’s sisters are testing the game. His
   brother Michael is helping, as are his parents. A few friends — Paul
   Conway, Dren McDonald, and Ian Dunbar — are rounding out the work on
   the art and other details.
   Romero family and friends: Michael, John, Brenda, and Donovan.

   Romero, Donovan Romero-Brathwaite, and Michael Romero.

   “We’ve got more people on this than most indie games,” John said in an
   interview.

   They’ve made enough progress to put the game up for pre-order on the
   Humble Store, which devotes 10 percent of proceeds to charity.

   The title’s story is set after an apocalypse, where a scientist
   accidentally set off seven atomic bombs and wiped out most of the
   population. The “last Mexican in the U.S.” is one of the people left
   standing. A bunch of mutant creatures have emerged and are attacking
   the survivors. The taco truck driver tries to feed those who are still
   alive, but he has to heavily arm his taco truck in order to deal with
   the mutants.

   “Your goal is to get the taco truck to Canada,” Donovan told me.

   Donovan got the idea last summer. With help from his stepdad, he
   created a design document. It described the plot and had drawings of
   the artwork. It also outlined weapons, creatures, and locations. He
   completed the document in November, and development began in December
   using the Corona software development kit.

   “We’re fortunate that we have family and friends to take advantage of
   his idea and make it a reality,” Brenda said. “He has a good
   environment. He [is surrounded] by games all of the time. He’s probably
   at a stage of skill now where I was in my early 20s.”

   The Romeros got an artist to start working on the imagery. While all of
   the design is Donovan’s, Brenda is working on balancing the game.
   Players will experience 40 locations and a bunch of monsters, including
   a devil chicken (who clearly doesn’t want to be part of a taco). The
   chicken shoots “dark matter” from its beak and lasers from its eyes.

   “The final draft of the design is absolutely ridiculous,” Brenda said.

   The team completed an alpha version, which is ready for testing.
   Donovan did the coding for the introduction screens. He’s learning
   about game-development milestones and how to work with the family as a
   team.

   They are hoping for a June release on iOS. John said he met with Apple,
   and the company was excited about it. Any proceeds will go toward
   Donovan’s college fund, and the title will ship with his hand-drawn
   design doc.

   Donovan said his creative side comes from the games he plays or
   watches. He was inspired to see his mother win an award at the recent
   Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco. In front of a crowd
   of thousands, she accepted the honors for the Ambassador Award. Donovan
   wants to return to the GDC and win an award himself one day.

   “He wanted to be a game developer since he was maybe seven,” Brenda
   said. “But we thought he had to master reading first. We thought it
   would be a great exercise to learn coding and design a game while doing
   that.”

   (Reuters) — Facebook’s Instagram is trialing a feature that lets U.S.
   users shop from the photo-sharing app by using a “checkout” option on
   items tagged for sale, the company said on Tuesday.

   The move is in line with Facebook’s plan to monetize higher-growth
   units like Instagram, as its centerpiece News Feed product struggles to
   generate fresh interest.

   Instagram has partnered with more than 20 brands including Adidas, H&M,
   Kylie Cosmetics and Michael Kors on the shopping feature, easing into
   territory more familiar to retail giants like Amazon.com and Walmart.

   The feature will allow U.S. Instagram users to click on a product
   featured in a post, see its price, and click again to bring up an order
   form.

   Users can then check out and pay via Visa, Mastercard, American
   Express, Discover or PayPal. Previously, Instagram allowed brands to
   link to their respective websites for users to make purchases.

   “Facebook’s track record on privacy is the bigger issue (that) may
   negatively affect the launch of in-app purchases,” said Gabriella
   Santaniello, founder of retail research firm A line Partners. “I would
   expect there to be some reticence when inputting your credit card
   information upon checkout.”

   The world’s largest social network is under intense pressure to improve
   its handling of data following a number of controversies related to
   user privacy on its platform.

   Instagram, which did not specify any financial details of its
   partnerships, said it would introduce a selling fee to help fund
   transaction-related expenses.

   In a similar move last year, image-search platform Pinterest introduced
   a feature called “Product Pins,” to provide prices and links to
   retailers’ checkout pages to make purchases.

   Instagram has more than 130 million users tapping to reveal product
   tags in shopping posts every month, up from 90 million in September, it
   said.

   Facebook has plans to evolve Instagram and Messenger into robust
   e-commerce platforms where users can click on ads and buy products,
   said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners.

   The illusion of job safety for the 3.5 million cashiers in America was
   shattered last week when Amazon Go, the first cashierless grocery store
   in the United States, opened in Seattle. By most accounts, the store is
   highly functional: It is difficult to shoplift, and the technology —
   which Amazon described only as involving “sophisticated computer vision
   and machine learning software” — accurately identifies which items
   shoppers put in their bags. In contrast to previous efforts at
   automating grocery store checkout, like the perpetually frustrating
   self-checkout kiosks, this one looks like it just might be a success.

   Though it’s unclear where this technology will lead, its very existence
   indicates an increasingly automated future for the grocery store
   industry. And this industry is only one of the dozens where reliance on
   machines has altered the way we think about human employment. From
   agriculture to banking, the automation effect shows no signs of slowing
   down.

   Are you next? Here’s how automation is likely to affect three massive
   industries in the United States that collectively account for 19.5
   percent of employment — roughly 30,000,000 American jobs.

Manufacturing

   On October 6, 2017, President Donald Trump named a National Day of
   Manufacturing. This act was one of many plans that he has put in motion
   to save the American manufacturing industry, from automobile production
   to a revival of coal products. And to look at employment, it may appear
   that the industry does need reviving: In 1980, over 19 million
   Americans worked in manufacturing; today, only 12 million Americans do.

   In 2016, though, North American automotive companies spent over $282
   million on robots. Because of this, manufacturing output achieved a
   record high in Q3 of 2017. Productivity is up, with manufacturers
   producing 47 percent more than they did 27 years ago. The advent of
   automation in manufacturing allowed the industry to produce more with
   fewer employees — an outcome that is desirable for both businesses and
   the economy, if not for employees.

   This does not mean, however, that robots are coming for manufacturing
   jobs — at least, not any more than they already have. Figures from the
   Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that employment in manufacturing is
   on the rise: After the sharp drop-off in manufacturing employment in
   1998, there was an all-time low in 2010, and since then employment has
   been steadily increasing. Will it ever reach the same employment
   numbers as in the golden age from the 1950s to the late 1990s? No, but
   the increased productivity that comes from humans and robots working in
   tandem has allowed the industry to expand so that companies can hire
   both more workers and more robots. Today, Amazon has 15,000 robots
   working alongside its 50,000 human employees.

Food service and retail

   The Amazon Go store is the perfect example of how automation can
   streamline the user experience in retail settings. And while it’s the
   first of its kind in the grocery store ecosystem, this model of
   seamless self-service has been successfully executed in the restaurant
   industry already. Eatsa, for instance, was one of the first serverless
   restaurants to launch in 2015. Although the chain has had to close all
   but two locations since, its model was adopted by numerous other
   restaurants, particularly those housed in airports.

   This model of fast food isn’t new, of course: Until 1991 people looking
   for food on the go would turn to automats, serverless restaurants that
   resembled vending machines. Much like self-service kiosks at grocery
   stores, though, the technology enabling this self-service was not
   sophisticated enough to make the experience truly seamless. As Amazon
   Go has demonstrated, once humanless experiences add tangible value to
   the user — rather than adding friction, as is so often the case with
   self-checkout — people start using it.

   Because of this, we will see the increased stratification of fine
   dining and self-serve fast food. The human server will become a luxury,
   not a given, and human-human interactions will be offered as a sign of
   indulgence. Fast-food employees will be hit the hardest because they
   offer the least in terms of providing a dining experience.

Agriculture

   From electronic milking to robotic greenhouse lettuce harvesting, the
   agriculture industry has been revolutionized by technology, much of it
   informed by sensors in IoT farming products.

   Despite this massive usage of automation, however, employment in the
   sector has actually skyrocketed over the past ten years — going up over
   200,000 jobs and expected to rise another few thousand by 2026. Pay for
   fieldworkers has risen over 50 percent since 1996 in California. And
   with ever-increasing production demands, it’s likely that the
   agriculture industry will continue to be a high source of employment,
   particularly in the area of developing, managing, and analyzing
   automation technologies. In fact, a 2015 report from the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture found that there was high demand for college
   graduates with degrees in agricultural programs. The report predicted
   that nearly 60,000 high-skilled agriculture jobs were expected to open
   annually in the U.S. over the course of five years.

   Numerous reports have demonstrated that Americans do not want to work
   in the fields, however, and the trend toward increasingly automated
   picking and harvesting means that the jobs opening up will be skilled,
   rather than manual. For most Americans this is good news, but for many
   immigrants and lower-income rural Americans, this could mean a job
   shortage.

Where automation takes, it also gives

   The conventional economic interpretation of the impact of automation is
   that it results in labor switching — that is, workers of a particular
   skill set moving from one industry or position to another. For
   instance, in the banking industry, ATMs replaced tellers, but overall
   employment in banks went up. Amazon has pushed this theory, arguing
   that stores like Amazon Go change the role of employees, not their very
   existence.

   Not everyone is so optimistic, though. Futurists including Elon Musk
   and Bill Gates have proposed radical solutions to what they see as a
   potential uptick in productivity and downturn in employment. Their
   suggestions include implementing a universal basic income (UBI) and
   taxing robots. Ultimately, much of the future of labor will be decided
   through policy and whatever incentives businesses are given for
   choosing human labor over robotic labor.

   It was only a matter of time. Alibaba has introduced a device that is
   about $100 to $275 cheaper than those made by Amazon, Google, and
   Apple. The new device will sell for about $75, while Amazon’s Echo list
   price is $180, Google Home goes for $129, and the Apple HomePod will
   cost a whopping $349. Let the voice assistant price wars begin!

   It’s too early to compare its performance and functionality to those of
   its older rivals — let alone language availability, but Alibaba’s Tmall
   Genie, as it’s called, has two advantages out of the gate: one obvious
   and one not-so-obvious.

   First, the obvious one: its aforementioned low price.  As VentureBeat
   has previously reported, price is the most important factor consumers
   consider when shopping for a voice assistant or smart speaker. Might
   Alibaba go head-to-head with Amazon one day?

   Second, less obviously: Even as it tries to outdo the likes of Amazon,
   Alibaba will benefit from competition and cooperation among local
   rivals like Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent. For instance, Baidu released
   its Apollo project, which includes DuerOS software for self-driving
   cars. Tencent, meanwhile, has developed Xiaowei, a voice assistant
   device of its own, and recently opened an AI lab in Seattle. All this
   points to China’s ambition to become an AI powerhouse, which will swell
   the tide and lift Alibaba’s AI boat.

   find it easier than thought to run early AI experiments to clear their
   vision on how to accelerate their competitiveness. However, several
   myths will be on the […]

   What it will be like to have Alexa or Siri drive you home

   The car was once a physical embodiment of freedom and liberty, allowing
   us to drop everything and take to the open road. Today, it’s a symbol
   of oppression — a mobile prison cell where drivers “do time” as they
   sit in traffic on their daily commute. Over the next decade, this may
   change: Self-driving technology […]

   Fake news: you ain’t seen nothing yet

   Earlier this year Françoise Hardy, a French musician, appeared in a
   YouTube video (see link). She is asked, by a presenter off-screen, why
   President Donald Trump sent his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to lie
   about the size of the inauguration crowd. First, Ms Hardy argues. Then
   she says Mr Spicer “gave alternative facts to that”. It’s all a little
   odd, not least because Françoise Hardy (pictured), who is now 73, looks
   only 20, and the voice coming out of her mouth belongs to Kellyanne
   Conway, an adviser to Mr Trump. (via The Economist)

   It’s Too Late to Stop China From Becoming an AI Superpower

   Last Thursday, Texas senior senator John Cornyn stood before an
   audience of wonks at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington,
   DC, and warned that America’s openness to investors looking for new
   ideas in technologies like artificial intelligence was putting it in
   danger. “Most of what China wants to invest in these days is
   leading-edge US technology that’s a key to our future military
   capabilities,” he said. “Unless the trend line changes, we may one day
   see some of these technologies incorporated in China-made equipment
   that can be used against our country in the event, heaven forbid, of a
   military conflict.” (via Wired)

   Alibaba today announced the launch of DT PAI, a new service in its
   Aliyun public cloud that will be able to handle machine learning
   processes.

   Aliyun will launch a free public trial of the service for a select
   group of early users in the next few weeks, DT PAI product manager Xiao
   Wei told VentureBeat in an email.

   “DTPAI contains matured and advanced ML algorithms whose effectiveness
   are verified by Alibaba’s profound data scenarios in Taobao, Tmall or
   Alipay business,” Wei wrote. The service can deal with workloads such
   as classification, clustering, feature abstraction, and large-scale
   statistics, he wrote. The service will even be able to perform an
   increasingly popular type of artificial intelligence known as deep
   learning.

   When it comes to logistic regression, a type of statistical model, DT
   PAI “can process data with 10 billion plus dimensions of features and
   100 billion plus of records,” Wei wrote.

   It’s not surprising to see Alibaba expand its cloud like this. Amazon
   Web Services and Microsoft Azure have both released cloud services for
   machine learning in the past year. And Alibaba is quickly revving up to
   match the capabilities of those public clouds. Last month, Aliyun
   announced plans to add graphic processing units (GPUs) and solid state
   drives (SSDs), and Alibaba also committed to spending $1 billion to
   expand Aliyun in Japan, Europe and the Middle East.

   Alibaba is indeed based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, far from the
   West Coast, where Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are based. But the
   company is obviously looking to expand its business outside of China.

   “We are happy to serve users worldwide and we support English,” Wei
   wrote.

   Facebook marks another milestone in helping businesses reach new
   customers. The social media company announced today that it now counts
   more than 5 million active advertisers, a 1 million increase in the
   past seven months. Three quarters of these advertisers are outside the
   U.S., and the biggest verticals are ecommerce, entertainment and media,
   and retail.

   To further adoption by small and medium-sized businesses, Facebook is
   launching new tools and resources, including providing one-click
   options to reinstate high-performing ads within Ads Manager, opening
   a single inbox to the desktop, creating a “studio” to help businesses
   build ads using a mobile device, and expanding its small business
   council.

Helping small businesses navigate mobile

   While Facebook is celebrating its 5 million advertiser milestone, that
   still only accounts for around 8 percent of the 65 million businesses
   that have a presence on the social network. Katherine Shappley, the
   company’s director overseeing SMBs in North America, acknowledged that
   there’s a delta between these figures, but said that there’s a “big
   opportunity for Facebook to put out the right solutions to help
   advertisers find that their investment works on the platform and
   they’re growing their business.” She believes that when small
   businesses are able to succeed, communities will thrive — which is a
   core focus of Facebook.

   Shappley cited the founder letter recently penned by company chief
   executive Mark Zuckerberg, highlighting Facebook’s commitment to
   supporting infrastructure to build global communities and further
   positive impact around the world. “Small businesses are a vital part of
   those communities,” she said. “With 65 million business Pages on
   Facebook and 8 million profiles on Instagram, we have the privilege of
   connecting the largest online small business community globally.”

   However, she didn’t deny that more needed to be done to help businesses
   on the platform. “Privileges comes with responsibility. If you think
   about it, technology has created amazing opportunities for people and
   small businesses, but it can also be challenging for small businesses
   when you think about limited time and resources when trying to reach
   new customers when every consumer is reaching for their phone,”
   Shappley said. “We really want to empower those small businesses to
   embrace the mobile world.”

Nearly half of all Facebook advertisers use mobile

   Nearly 50 percent of Facebook’s 5 million advertisers are creating ads
   on mobile devices. And in order for the company to increase adoption,
   and in the process shore up additional revenue opportunities, it has to
   provide marketers with the tools and resources needed to switch over.

   For those already creating ads on mobile, the company has updated its
   Ads Manager app to speed up the process. “We heard from small
   businesses that they want robust ad management capabilities on mobile,”
   Shappley said. Among the newest features is the addition of a one-click
   option allowing marketers to reinstate high-performing ads. Facebook
   has also expanded the interest types that can be targeted and given
   businesses the ability to compare ads. The company is also now going to
   suggest actions that can be taken to improve ad performance.

   In November, Facebook launched a new inbox experience for businesses
   that consolidated messages across the social network, Instagram, and
   Messenger. The feature was initially constrained to mobile devices, but
   now Single Inbox is being expanded to the desktop so marketers can
   manage their relationship with customers on a laptop, tablet, or
   smartphone.

   Facebook has also launched a way for businesses to target globally,
   instead of just thinking locally. Now there are cross-border tools that
   can be used to connect a business with people in other countries. The
   first is “international lookalikes,” which matches marketers with
   people in new countries who resemble the company’s best customers. The
   second is worldwide region targeting that pairs campaigns with the most
   efficient conversions. Lastly, businesses can create customized
   campaigns in each country through country snapshots and an insights
   playbook.

   “As a small business, you’re worried about starting from scratch, and
   it’s time-intensive, especially for the one that has 1 to 2 hours
   dedicated to marketing,” Shappley explained. “Facebook will show you
   the optimal people to target in those countries.”

   Some small businesses may be more interested in education, which is why
   the social media company is launching Mobile Studio, a place for
   marketers to discover ways to create ads using a mobile device. The
   site has tips on remixing, shooting from scratch, and more. Shappley
   described this service as a “celebration of how to make great creative
   on mobile. Not only is it showcasing what we have natively, [it is
   sharing] how to use the apps that are free or relatively inexpensive to
   create something very compelling.” She believes Mobile Studio will be
   inspirational for small businesses.

   To help connect small businesses with one another while also keeping
   each other apprised of issues they go through, Facebook set up several
   small business councils. Currently, there are four around the world —
   in the United States, India, Brazil, and Germany — but to expand the
   reach of these groups, Facebook is launching websites to tell their
   stories. Today, the company launched the first one for the U.S. This
   will highlight 40 small businesses and look at how they used Facebook
   to reach their communities and customers.

   There are plans to expand the small business councils to other
   countries later this year.

   Finally, Facebook has released numbers around its Blueprint online
   courses, which provide education around advertising on the social
   network and related properties. More than 2.5 million courses have been
   taken from more than 1 million people across 150 countries, half of
   them small businesses. Shappley stated that new courses are going to be
   added soon, including courses around how to monetize video, make
   copyright correction on the platform, and more.

   “We couldn’t be more excited about small businesses. The company is
   rallying around to make sure we have the solutions for this segment.
   We’re highly motivated about the stories coming from small businesses,”
   Shappley said. “The biggest part of the announcement is that we’re
   continuing to create solutions for [them]. This will certainly not be
   the last announcement in that ongoing commitment.”
