David Suzuki: The problems with incinerating waste

   by David Suzuki on September 10th, 2013 at 4:09 PM

   1 of 1 2 of 1

   Many urban areas have built or are considering building
   waste-incineration facilities to generate energy. At first glance, it
   seems like a win-win. You get rid of “garbage” and acquire a new energy
   source with fuel that’s almost free. But it’s a problematic solution,
   and a complicated issue.

   Metro Vancouver has a facility in Burnaby and is planning to build
   another, and Toronto is also looking at the technology, which has been
   used elsewhere in the region, with a plant in Brampton and another
   under construction in Clarington. The practice is especially popular in
   the European Union, where countries including Sweden and Germany now
   have to import waste to fuel their generators.

   The term “waste” is correct; there’s really no such thing as garbage.
   And that’s one problem with burning it for fuel. Even those who promote
   the technology would probably agree that the best ways to deal with
   waste are to reduce, reuse and recycle it. It’s astounding how much
   unnecessary trash we create, through excessive packaging, planned
   obsolescence, hyperconsumerism, and lack of awareness. This is one area
   where individuals can make a difference, by refusing to buy
   overpackaged goods and encouraging companies to reduce packaging, and
   by curbing our desire to always have newer and shinier stuff.

   We toss out lots of items that can be reused, repaired or altered for
   other purposes. As for recycling, we’ve made great strides, but we
   still send close to three quarters of our household waste to the
   landfill. Considering each Canadian produces close to 1,000 kilograms
   of waste a year, that’s a lot of trash! Much of the material that ends
   up in landfills is usable, compostable, or recyclable, including tonnes
   of plastics.

   Turning unsorted and usable trash into a valuable fuel commodity means
   communities are less likely to choose to reduce, reuse and recycle it.
   Burning waste can seem easier and less expensive than sorting,
   diverting, and recycling it. But once it’s burned, it can never be used
   for anything else—it’s gone!

   Incinerating waste also comes with environmental problems. Although
   modern technologies reduce many air pollutants once associated with the
   process, burning plastics and other materials still creates emissions
   that can contain toxins such as mercury, dioxins, and furans. As with
   burning fossil fuels, burning waste—much of which is plastics derived
   from fossil fuels—also produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide
   emissions that contribute to climate change.

   Burning waste doesn’t make it disappear, either. Beyond the fly ash and
   pollutants released into the atmosphere, a great deal of toxic “bottom
   ash” is left over. Metro Vancouver says bottom ash from its Burnaby
   incinerator is about 17 percent the weight of the waste burned. That
   ash must be disposed of, usually in landfills. Metro testing has found
   high levels of the carcinogenic heavy metal cadmium in bottom ash,
   sometimes twice the limit allowed for landfills. High lead levels have
   also been reported.

   Incineration is also expensive and inefficient. Once we start the
   practice, we come to rely on waste as a fuel commodity, and it’s tough
   to go back to more environmentally sound methods of dealing with it. As
   has been seen in Sweden and Germany, improving efforts to reduce,
   reuse, and recycle can actually result in shortages of waste “fuel”!

   It’s a complicated issue. We need to find ways to manage waste and to
   generate energy without relying on diminishing and increasingly
   expensive supplies of polluting fossil fuels. Sending trash to
   landfills is clearly not the best solution. But we have better options
   than landfills and incineration, starting with reducing the amount of
   waste we produce. Through education and regulation, we can reduce
   obvious sources and divert more compostable, recyclable, and reusable
   materials away from the dump. It’s simply wasteful to incinerate it.

   It would be far better to sort trash into organics, recyclables and
   products that require careful disposal. We could then divert these
   different streams to minimize our waste impacts and produce new
   commodities. Organics used in biomass energy systems could help offset
   fossil fuel use while creating valuable supplies of fertilizers.
   Diversion and recycling lessen the need to extract new resources and
   disrupt the environment while creating more value and jobs. That’s a
   win all around!

   An earlier version of this article misidentified Burlington, Ontario,
   as the location of an incinerator.

   David Suzuki,you really know NOTHING about modern day incinerators do
   you?

   It frustrates me that STILL today the Eco Brigade fails to actually
   research what they spew about......

   I invite you Mr zuki, for a tour of the most modern incinerator in the
   world, right here in your backyard.........

   I question the facts in this article, given that Burlington doesn't
   even have an incinerator.

   "But once it’s burned, it can never be used for anything else—it’s
   gone!"

   No it is not gone, as Suzuki later points out. It has been converted
   largely to carbon dioxide with other chemical side products. The world
   is an almost closed system from the view point of matter. We do
   accumulate matter from cosmic dust and meteors and the like, and we do
   lose some matter as some gas escapes and we send things up in space,
   but for the most part, all matter stays on earth, it just gets
   converted between forms and moved around.

   The earth has processes for recycling matter. Carbon dioxide in
   particular is recycled by photosynthesis into carbohydrates and these
   are used to build other molecules from basic elements. Thus burning
   waste only highlights the importance of maintaining the photosynthetic
   cycle, which of course means reducing our wanton destruction of habitat
   so that those organisms (e.g. phytoplankton, plants) that recycle the
   carbon dioxide can continue to do so.

   As for the toxic leftovers, like heavy metals, the earth has ways of
   dealing with that too, the primary means being dilution and burial.

   The real problem is not any individual process that we as humans
   undertake. It is that there are far too many of us, individually
   consuming far too much and far too rapidly for the earth to compensate
   while maintaining equilibrium without reaching extremes. This of course
   means that the limits between which the earth's climate oscillates are
   getting farther apart, which will spell difficulties for many species
   not adapted or unable to adapt to the extremes and the oscillations.

   It's happened before and will happen again. Not so much being in the
   middle of it, although in the present-day case, we have only just
   begun.

   @jeremygsims@gmail.com: My apologies. Reference should have been to the
   incinerator in Brampton, not Burlington,for which the contract has not
   been renewed. It's been corrected.

   I very much appreciate Dr. Suzuki's perspective on this issue. Prevent
   Cancer Now, the non-profit organization of which I am co-chair, has
   done its homework. We know that incineration is harmful, for all the
   reasons cited above - it requires an ongoing, substantial waste stream
   (discouraging the 3Rs); it results in toxic waste in the incinerator
   that must be disposed of, and it is NOT cost-effective. The industry
   continues to block efforts to have unbiased testing of the effluent
   from its stacks and refuses to share the data it does have, so we have
   no way of knowing what is actually escaping into the air. They have a
   lot more explaining to do before foisting their toxic technology on
   unsuspecting citizens. Prevent Cancer Now continues to support
   organizations opposed to incineration, and has detailed information on
   our website, preventcancernow.ca.

   Burning waste for fuel only happens to the waste that is currently
   deemed non-recyclable or not economically viable to recycle. I still
   think it's better to extract the energy from this waste before
   disposing of it than to just dig it into a hole and then let it slowly
   produce all the same poisons. Can't the ash be used in concrete,
   perhaps as a partial replacement for sand, and used for, say, building
   transport infrastructure such as roads, bridges, runways and railways
   (sleepers)?
