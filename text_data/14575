” Also in ancient times, the son of Rama went through Iran. His name was Luv.
He went to Caucasus. That’s why the Russians are called as Slavs. You see,
his name was Luv – slav – with love.”

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, 1992-0915 Public Program, Los Angeles

Restore Parasympathetic Balance November 25, 2018

   Filed under: Sahaja yoga,Uncategorized — Peter @ 8:14 am

   Sahaja Yoga Meditation, Sahaja meditation, Sushumna nadi

It is proved that Parasympathetic Nervous System /PNS/ restores energy within
us. Watch this pictures and you will see that there is movement. Put your
attention above your head and you will see how movement is slower or stops.
This is how you activate your PNS. If you do Sahaja Yoga you can be in this
state all the time.

Should I search for the material or for the spiritual April 27, 2018

   Filed under: Shri Mataji — Peter @ 12:29 pm
   Tags: material or spiritual, Sahaja yoga, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,
   Spirit, Spirituality


   Question: I have a search for the material and a search for the
   spiritual, but while I am young should I use it for the search for the
   material or the search for the spiritual?

   Shri_Mataji: If you get the Spirit you get the material automatically.
   The whole material is controlled by the Spirit. Is very surprising how
   you get it. Is you enter into the realm of God. You’ll be amazed that
   in England, there’s such a lot of joblessness, people don’t have jobs
   at all, unemployment. See all these words I don’t know. Unemployment.
   But not a single Sahaja Yogi is unemployed. Not a single Sahaja Yogi is
   unemployed. The other day, one gentleman was to come from Paris to
   Australia for a particular seminar and he thought he wanted to come
   because this is the other side of the world and all that, but quite
   excited. But he didn’t have money, and suddenly he got the money which
   he wasn’t to get for eight years. Suddenly he got the money, he is
   here. All such miracles work out. From Australia I’ll tell you one
   miracle that’s most interesting. There was a little girl, she wrote a
   letter to me: “Mother, I want to come and see you in India, but I don’t
   have so much money to come.” She and her mother they both wanted to
   come and they had a fete in the school and she had taken a trinket for
   selling and when the teacher saw it she said, “This is gold, better
   take it to your mother.” And when they went to the jeweller the amount
   was the same as they would need to go to India. So in so many ways you
   are helped. You don’t know the realm of God is very different. So
   efficient, works so fast. We haven’t entered into that realm.
   Public Lecture – Brisbane Australia 1987

Forgiveness April 1, 2018

   Filed under: Sahaja yoga,Uncategorized — Peter @ 6:15 am
   Tags: Forgiveness, Sahaja yoga, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

   “Now also you should surrender yourself to this idea of forgiveness and
   really try to forgive. You will be amazed, you will feel very much
   peaceful, very happy and the person who has tortured you will come
   round. What we have to do now, is to transform people. That’s our job.
   We have to transform them.”
   (HH Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, Easter puja , Istanbul, 25/4/99)

Parasympathetic nervous system January 24, 2018

   Filed under: Sahaja yoga,YOGA — Peter @ 7:40 am
   Tags: parasympathetic nervous system, Sahaja yoga, Shri Mataji Nirmala
   Devi, Sushumna nadi

What is the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
systems?
The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for intense physical
activity and is often referred to as the fight-or-flight response. The
parasympathetic nervous system has almost the exact opposite effect and
relaxes the body and inhibits or slows many high energy functions.

“The Parasympathetic Nervous System is the gross expression of the central
subtle channel (Sushumna Nadi), and cannot be activated by the seeker’s own
efforts. Whenever he puts in any effort, his attention moves immediately to
the Sympathetic Nervous System, never to the parasympathetic.” -Shri Mataji’s
First Book
