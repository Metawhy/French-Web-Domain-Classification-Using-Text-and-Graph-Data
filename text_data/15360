about the clam

   In just five years, The Clam has quickly become one of the West
   Village's favorite neighborhood restaurants. Mike Price, chef and
   co-owner, offers a menu that celebrates seasonal, market driven
   ingredients (with a playful focus on, you guessed it, clams), while
   showcasing the best seafood of the Eastern seaboard in both classic and
   contemporary presentations. The menu is rounded out with iced
   shellfish, salads, and appetizers, as well as meat and local seafood
   entrées. Our approach is simple and straightforward, and we try to let
   our ingredients speak for themselves.

   The Clam's acclaimed beverage program offers a selection of spirits,
   cocktails and wines that match in quality, integrity, and purpose. Our
   Beverage Director, David Giuliano, has cultivated a thoughtful and
   inspired wine list ranging from organic, biodynamic, and natural
   selections, to some of his favorite small producers from around the
   world, all chosen to complement Price's food.

   Our shared vision and common goal is to offer genuine hospitality to
   our guests, and, hopefully, being a West Village destination where our
   guests feel at home.

   [mike-price-headshot-2019-web.jpg] mike price | CHEF/Co-OWNER

   Chef Mike Price is no stranger to the authentic flavors of fresh,
   simply prepared food. Raised in a small town along the Chesapeake Bay,
   Mike planted the seeds of his career early on, tending to his family's
   farm and cooking at a local crab house on weekends during high school.

   A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, he completed an
   externship at the esteemed Symphony Cafe in New York City, where he
   would later return to work for three years following graduation. After
   mastering all stations in the kitchen, Mike brought his expertise to
   the high-profile clientele at Sullivan's Restaurant and Broadcast
   Lounge for two years before accepting the tournant position at the
   Waterclub. Moving to Miami shortly thereafter, Mike opened Fish, an
   upscale seafood restaurant where he took on the role of sous chef for
   two years, after which he returned to Maryland to explore a more
   managerial course heading up a corporate dining room in his hometown.
   Read More...

   In early 2007, Mike and his good friend and then-future business
   partner, Joey Campanaro, discussed opening a restaurant together.
   Boasting an open kitchen where Mike can greet customers, share recipes,
   tips on what’s in-season, and demonstrate his knack for customer
   service to the West Village neighborhood, Market Table is the
   restaurant Mike always dreamed of opening.  Since opening the
   restaurant in 2007, Mike has received critical and popular acclaim and
   has been featured in such outlets as Food & Wine, Conde Nast Traveler,
   The New York Times, New York Magazine, Time Out New York, Travel +
   Leisure, The Today Show and many others.

   This past winter, Mike along with co-owner Joey Campanaro, opened The
   Clam, a seafood-centric restaurant just a few blocks from Market Table
   in the West Village, where he is both co-owner and executive chef. At
   The Clam, Mike offers signature dishes like Cherrystone Stuffies with
   Pancetta, Trinity and Lemon; Clam Dip with Zesty Potato Chips; and
   Spaghetti & Clams with Spicy Gravy and Salad on Top.

   In 2001, Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams asked Mike to be sous chef at
   The Harrison, where he subsequently spent the next year-and-a-half
   honing his skills in the sophisticated flavors of New American cuisine.
   When The Mermaid Inn opened in the East Village in 2003, Mike was the
   obvious choice to head the kitchen. After creating the Mediterranean
   and North Atlantic inspired seafood menu, Mike proved his talent for
   drawing on coastal influences and using the finest in fresh and
   seasonal ingredients.

   In early 2007, Mike and his good friend and then-future business

   [laura-geoffrey-headshot.jpg] laura geoffrey | GENERAL MANAGER

   Growing up in small-town Pennsylvania, Laura Geoffrey was fortunate to
   have parents who fixed dinner every day (although it was mostly her
   mom). Homeschooled so she could spend long hours practicing the violin,
   she was also able to travel extensively for music from an early age,
   which in turn developed into a curiosity and love for foods that were
   inaccessible at home. Though it was still the early days of the World
   Wide Web, soon she was online, furtively ordering spices, unusual
   legumes and fascinating cookbooks with funds obtained from teaching
   music on the side out of her childhood bedroom. Some of these culinary
   maneuvers weren’t always a hit with the family crowd, but others were
   quite delicious.

   Studying music with some of the notables of classical violin led
   inevitably to New York, where Laura relocated just a few months shy of
   eighteen. While at The Manhattan School of Music, she lived in an
   apartment where she kept cooking, now with access to virtually any
   ingredient she desired.

   maneuvers weren’t always a hit with the family crowd, but others were
   quite delicious.

   Studying music with some of the notables of classical violin led
   inevitably to New York, where Laura relocated just a few months shy of
   eighteen. While at The Manhattan School of Music, she lived in an
   apartment where she kept cooking, now with access to virtually any
   ingredient she desired. After a few experimental years as a
   pescatarian, she returned to eating everything under the sun except for
   tripe. In the meantime, she had left conservatory and started waiting
   tables and bartending to pay the hefty New York City bills, all the
   while continuing to teach and pursue music as well. During this period,
   a few things happened. Laura turned twenty-one and through her
   restaurant gigs had the ability to taste some pretty cool wine. She
   also read the seminal books The Omnivore’s Dilemma (Michael Pollan) and
   Fast Food Nation (Eric Schlosser) and really began paying attention to
   how our food habits affect the environment and our health. In her
   mid-twenties, she enrolled in an undergraduate program at Columbia
   University’s School of General Studies. There, she studied several
   languages and considered a path devoted to the Middle East, but ended
   up shifting to an Italian major, inspired by the Slow Food Movement.

   Still working while in school, Laura’s focus honed in on wine. Despite
   the fact that she found cooking at home enormously satisfying, doing so
   in a professional kitchen wasn’t something she was up for. However, the
   possibilities with wine were many, and general interest in a career as
   a sommelier was just starting to heat up in the city. Exhilarated by
   the diversity of wine in Italy, her interest soon spread to Burgundy
   and the Loire Valley. At Battersby in Carroll Gardens, she put together
   a 65-bottle program with an emphasis on lesser-known regions, and was
   able to play around a bit, building her chops with the spontaneous
   tasting menu and pairings. Moving on to Rouge Tomate, she opened
   bottles and moved an infinite number of cases around as a sommelier
   under the singular Loire daughter Pascaline Lepeltier. A uniquely
   developmental experience, it was also one that allowed her to get into
   the nitty gritty of biodynamic and natural wines. This was capped off
   by a year at 3-Michelin starred Le Bernardin, where she was able to
   fine-tune her service and taste some of the rare wines of the world,
   culled from a cellar of greats bar none.

   Currently residing in Greenpoint, Brooklyn Laura joined The Clam as
   General Manager in March of 2016, following a brief stint with the
   company’s events arm. As GM, she oversees all day-to-day operations,
   working closely with Chef Mike Price to ensure a congenial, welcoming
   second home for her guests, inspired by the concept of gemütlichkeit -
   a sense of peaceful and warm contentedness. She spends most nights on
   the floor, and is always delighted to introduce someone to a new bottle
   or serve an old favorite.
   [joey-campanaro-headshot.jpg] joey campanaro | co-owner

   Joey Campanaro was raised in Philadelphia, where the food of his
   childhood inspired him to make cooking his career. With a culinary
   approach rooted in his Italian grandmother’s kitchen and honed in a
   range of America’s top restaurants, Campanaro brings a lifelong
   affinity for Mediterranean cuisine to every dish he creates.
   Read More...

   In 2001, Campanaro moved to New York to open The Harrison in Tribeca,
   where he earned a two-star review from The New York Times, but it was
   in 2006 that things really started to come together when Campanaro
   opened his dream restaurant, the West Village gem Little Owl. Little
   Owl has enjoyed a continued buzz as one of New York’s most exciting and
   iconic restaurants, and has since been joined by Little Owl the Venue
   and Little Owl the Townhouse, both private event spaces and culinary
   showrooms in New York City.

   In 2007, Campanaro joined with his good friend Mike Price to open
   Market Table on a charming corner of Manhattan’s West Village
   neighborhood, where warm hospitality and seasonal, modern American

   Joey Campanaro was raised in Philadelphia, where the food of his
   childhood inspired him to make cooking his career. With a culinary
   approach rooted in his Italian grandmother’s kitchen and honed in a
   range of America’s top restaurants, Campanaro brings a lifelong
   affinity for Mediterranean cuisine to every dish he creates.

   In 2001, Campanaro moved to New York to open The Harrison in Tribeca,
   where he earned a two-star review from The New York Times, but it was
   in 2006 that things really started to come together when Campanaro
   opened his dream restaurant, the West Village gem Little Owl. Little
   Owl has enjoyed a continued buzz as one of New York’s most exciting and
   iconic restaurants, and has since been joined by Little Owl the Venue
   and Little Owl the Townhouse, both private event spaces and culinary
   showrooms in New York City.

   In 2007, Campanaro joined with his good friend Mike Price to open
   Market Table on a charming corner of Manhattan’s West Village
   neighborhood, where warm hospitality and seasonal, modern American
   cuisine takes center stage. Following the success of Market Table, the
   duo opened The Clam, a seafood-centric restaurant just a few blocks
   away.

   David Giuliano has an insatiable thirst for knowledge, a trait that has
   taken him around the city, the country and the world refining his
   talents as a respected Manhattan wine professional. Collaborating with
   Chefs Joey Campanaro and Mikey Price, Giuliano brings his wine
   discoveries back to the West Village to enrich the beverage programs as
   Beverage Director and Partner with Blackfoot Hospitality.

   passion for the world of food and wine, David has developed a unique

   His work has become a balancing act between the established benchmark
   wines and the more unique producers that are shifting the paradigm of
   wine in a fresh and exciting direction. Through extensive travel and
   diligent tasting, David has established invaluable relationships that
   make available to the restaurants a catalogue of wines that are rare,
   allocated and highly sought after.

   “I’m not just interested in simply selling wine,” says Giuliano, “I’m
   interested in telling stories about all of the things that happen to
   that wine before it’s poured into your glass.” Before every service, he
   opens a bottle with his team to discuss the wine’s history, the unique
   winemaking properties, and the nuanced flavors. His team translates
   these stories to our restaurant’s customers, who in turn become more
   connected with the wine and restaurant.

   Recognized as a Certified Sommelier by the Court of Master Sommeliers,
   Giuliano curates beverage menus appealing to a variety of palates, from
   casual wine drinkers to more seasoned oenophiles. During recent years,
   he has taken strides to become more fully immersed with spirits and
   mixology, allowing him to skillfully guide our restaurant’s cocktail
   programs and lead his experienced bar teams.

   Prior to pursuing a career in the restaurant industry, Giuliano worked
   as a professional opera singer, which brought him around the world and
   gave him a unique set of skills that he applies to this career.
   Confidence, passion, performance style, and a rich understanding of
   languages and culture give David an edge in this increasingly more
   competitive and ever-evolving industry.
