   The International Astronomical Union (IAU) was founded in 1919. Its
   mission is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its
   aspects, including research, communication, education and development,
   through international cooperation. Its individual members — structured
   in Divisions, Commissions, and Working Groups — are professional
   astronomers from all over the world, at the Ph.D. level and beyond,
   active in professional research and education in astronomy. The IAU has
   13682 Individual Members in 107 countries worldwide. Of those countries
   82 are National Members. In addition, the IAU collaborates with various
   scientific organizations all over the world.
