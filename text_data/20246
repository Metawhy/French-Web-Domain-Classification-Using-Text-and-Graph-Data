Platinum Skin Care’s Story

     ActiveCampaign allows me to have a conversation with people and
     tailor it to what their needs are. With tags, I can say “this
     person’s in this product lane, that person’s in that product lane,
     that person’s in that product lane,” and I can segment my audience
     into different types of people so we’re giving them the right things
     and they’re really happy in the end.

The Produce Mom’s Story

     Through the ActiveCampaign platform, we are able to create a
     marketing funnel of school foodservice directors throughout the
     United States and provide them with content that is very specific to
     their needs, impacting over a billion annual school meals.

Heather Read’s Story

     As a photographer and a mother, it’s so important for me to have
     that extra time that I save using ActiveCampaign because I can focus
     more on my art and I can focus more on building relationships with
     the clients versus the tedious mundane things that so much time
     didn’t need to be spent on.

David Paige's Story

     I used to get 20% open rates and I thought I was doing really good.
     And then when I switched to ActiveCampaign and I started
     implementing some of these strategies, I’m seeing 50% and higher. My
     first few emails are all in the 80% to 50% range.

Privacy Policy

   Last Updated: July 1, 2019

   ActiveCampaign, LLC (“ActiveCampaign”) provides a marketing platform
   that allows clients to reach their customers, to understand how their
   customers interact with those communications and other content, and to
   customize marketing based on their customers’ interests. This Privacy
   Policy explains how ActiveCampaign collects, uses and discloses
   information from our clients (“clients” or “you”) when you use our
   website, platform and other online products and services (collectively,
   the “Services”) or when they otherwise interact with us. This policy
   does not apply to the information that our clients import into our
   Services, such as the email addresses of their customers or business
   contacts (“Contact Data”) or to the end users, customers, or business
   contacts to whom that Contact Data may belong. For additional
   information about the use of Contact Data in connection with our
   Services, please consult our Terms of Service, available at
   https://www.activecampaign.com/terms-of-service/.

   We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
   changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the
   policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice
   (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email
   notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever
   you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed
   about our information practices and the choices available to you.

Collection of Information

Information You Provide to Us

   We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we
   collect information when you create an account, participate in any
   interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, interact with a
   message board, apply for a job, request customer support, use our
   platform or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we
   may collect include your Personal Information and any other information
   you choose to provide. We or a designated third party may collect
   payment and credit card information when you subscribe to our paid
   Services or purchase additional services.

   When we say “Personal Information” we mean any information that
   identifies an individual, such as (but not limited to) an individual’s
   name, email address, postal address, device-specific information and
   log information (as described below). Any information that does not, on
   its own, identify an individual person is considered and treated as
   non-personal information. When non-personal information is combined
   with other information so that it does or can be used to identify an
   individual, this information is treated as Personal Information.

Information About Your Use of the Services

Usage Information

   We collect information about your use of the Services, such as the ways
   in which you use our platform, the way you respond to us when we send
   you emails or communications or your preferences when you interact with
   our Services.

Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services

   When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect
   information about you, including:
     * Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services,
       including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed,
       your IP address, your general location and the page you visited
       before navigating to our Services.
     * Device Information: We collect information about the computer or
       mobile device you use to access our Services, including the
       hardware model, operating system and version, unique device
       identifiers and mobile network information.
     * Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:
       We and our service providers use various technologies to collect
       information, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small
       data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help
       us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and
       features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons
       are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails
       and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and
       campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies, and how
       to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below or visit our
       “Cookie Policy” available at
       https://www.activecampaign.com/cookie-policy/.

Integrations with Other Services

   You may have the option of integrating our Services with other
   services, technologies or platforms on your desktop, permitted websites
   and/or your mobile phone. For example, we may offer you widgets that
   have countdowns to various launches. These integrations may require you
   to input Personal Information or access or use Personal Information.
   These integrations may (i) check for updates automatically and transmit
   your information to their server and/or engine; (ii) send information
   entered into or accessed by the technology to its server and/or engine
   and (iii) be visible to the public if embedded on publicly available
   webpages (such as social networking webpages), depending on the
   policies of that website.

Connecting Your Email Account

   Should you choose to connect your email account to our platform, you
   will be using a set of features built using technology from Nylas, Inc.
   By signing up or using the Nylas application, you understand and agree
   that Nylas, Inc. and its affiliates who provide Nylas (“Nylas”), will
   have access to your information and will be permitted to use that
   information for specific, limited purposes to provide the Services to
   you, in accordance with our agreement with Nylas.  This integration is
   a completely optional service and is not required to use our platform.

   Google OAuth:

   You have the option of integrating aspects of your Google email
   metadata with your account through our integration with Nylas. We will
   ask for your consent to connect your Google account to your
   ActiveCampaign account. This step is optional but can very valuable in
   helping you to make the best use of our platform by tracking your
   interactions with your leads and customers.

   When you connect your Google account with the ActiveCampaign platform
   through Nylas, we will have access to certain information such as the
   email meta headers (sender, recipient, and date), the email message
   body and subject line (“Google Data”).

   We only process Google Data you make available to us through this
   integration in order to provide the Service to you and to improve the
   Services, consistent with Google's Limited Use Requirements. We do not
   independently access the Google Data ourselves unless we first obtain
   your consent to view the Google Data (e.g., to provide you with tech
   support), we need to do so for internal security purposes, to comply
   with applicable law, or where the data is fully aggregated and
   anonymized for internal use purposes and cannot be used to identify you
   or your email recipients.

   In addition, we will only transfer the Google Data to others if
   necessary to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent
   in the Services, to comply with applicable laws, or as part of a
   merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. We also do not use Google Data
   for advertising purposes.

   At any time, you can disconnect your Google account and delete this
   data in your in your account or by reaching out to
   info@activecampaign.com and requesting that it be deleted.

Information We Collect From Other Sources

   We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with
   information we collect through our Services. For example, we may
   collect information about you from third parties, including but not
   limited to social media sites, credit bureaus, data enrichment
   providers and publicly available sources.

Use of Information

   We use the information we collect to provide, maintain and improve our
   Services, such as to administer your account and to provide you with
   insights to help you optimize your use of our platform.

   We may also use the information we collect to:
     * Provide, maintain, customize and improve our Services;
     * Provide and deliver the products and services you request, process
       transactions and send you transaction-related information,
       including confirmations and invoices,
     * Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support
       and administrative messages;
     * Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide
       customer service;
     * Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions,
       rewards and events offered by ActiveCampaign and others, and
       provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;
     * Monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with
       our Services;
     * Detect, investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other
       illegal activities and protect the rights and property of
       ActiveCampaign and others;
     * Personalize and improve the Services and provide advertisements,
       content or features that match user profiles or interests; and
     * Facilitate contests, sweepstakes and promotions and process and
       deliver entries and rewards; and
     * Carry out any other purpose described to you when your information
       was collected.

Sharing of Information

   We often need to engage third-party companies and individuals (such as
   payment processors, research companies and analytics and security
   providers) to help us operate and provide the Services. These third
   parties have only limited access to your information, may use your
   information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated
   to us not to disclose or use your information for other purposes.

   We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described
   in this Privacy Policy:
     * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need
       access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;
     * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure
       is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal
       process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or
       regulation;
     * If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or
       language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the
       rights, property and safety of ActiveCampaign or others;
     * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
       company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our
       business by another company;
     * Between and among ActiveCampaign and our current and future
       parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common
       control and ownership; and
     * With your consent or at your direction.

   We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot
   reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share a hashed
   version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on
   other services or platforms.

Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others

   We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the
   Internet and to provide analytics services. These entities may use
   cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information
   about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP
   address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked
   and conversion information. This information may be used by
   ActiveCampaign and others to, among other things, analyze and track
   data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising
   and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other
   websites and better understand your online activity. For more
   information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web
   browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please
   visit www.aboutads.info/choices or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ if
   you are in the EEA.

   We also use Google Analytics within our Services. For more information
   on how Google may use personal information about you, see
   www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ for more information.

   Please note: If you choose to opt-out of interest-based advertising,
   you may continue to see or receive online advertising, but such ads may
   not be as relevant to you.

Retaining Your Information

   ActiveCampaign will retain your information only for as long as is
   necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as
   described to you, for as long as your account is active (i.e., for the
   lifetime of your ActiveCampaign account), or as needed to provide the
   Services to you. If you no longer want ActiveCampaign to use your
   information to provide the Services to you, you may cancel your
   account. ActiveCampaign will retain and use your information to the
   extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if
   we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable
   tax/revenue laws or to demonstrate our compliance with applicable laws
   governing our interaction with you), resolve disputes and enforce our
   agreements. We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes.
   These log files are generally retained for a limited period of time,
   except in cases where they are used for the safety and security of the
   Services, to improve functionality of the Services or we are legally
   obligated to retain them for longer time periods.

Transfer of Information to the U.S. or Other Countries

   In order to provide you with the Services you subscribe to or that you
   request from us, your Personal Information will be transferred to the
   United States as that is where ActiveCampaign is based. In some cases,
   your Personal Information may be transferred to or accessed from other
   countries outside the United States, including when you consent and
   allow us to do so, where it is required in order for us to provide
   Services to you and when we need to do so to provide functions like
   product support, troubleshooting and gaining insights into the usage
   patterns of our Services. When your Personal Information is transferred
   to the United States and other countries, you may not have the same
   rights and protections as you do under local law. Any international
   transfers of your Personal Information will be done in accordance with
   applicable law.

EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield

   In connection with ActiveCampaign’s processing of Personal Information
   it receives from the European Union (“EU”) or Switzerland, we comply
   with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy
   Shield Framework (together “Privacy Shield”) with respect to Personal
   Information we process from the EU or Switzerland and transfer to the
   United States. For more information about the Privacy Shield, and to
   view our certification, please visit the Privacy Shield website. We
   remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield for any Personal
   Information that we share with third parties for external processing on
   our behalf, as described in the “Sharing of Information” section above,
   unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the
   damage. If you have an inquiry regarding our adherence to the Privacy
   Shield, we encourage you to contact us at info@activecampaign.com. We
   are subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the U.S.
   Federal Trade Commission. You may also refer your complaint
   free-of-charge to JAMS using this link:
   https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield, our designated Privacy
   Shield dispute resolution provider. In certain circumstances, the
   Privacy Shield provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to
   resolve complaints (see Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles for
   more details).

Residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland

   If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or
   Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the law
   regarding the processing of your Personal Information.

Lawful Basis for Processing

   If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, we primarily rely on
   the following bases to process your Personal Information lawfully.
     * First, it is necessary for us to process your Personal Information
       in certain ways in order to provide the Services to you, in
       accordance with a contract between you and us, namely, our Terms of
       Service, available at
       https://www.activecampaign.com/terms-of-service/.
     * Second, where you have given us valid consent to use your Personal
       Information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. This
       includes situations where we will obtain your consent prior to
       sending you information about our products and Services.
     * Third, in certain cases we may process your Personal Information
       where necessary to further ActiveCampaign’s legitimate interests,
       where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights
       or interests. This includes usage statistics, analytics and
       internal analysis we run to better understand how to use our
       platform so that we can improve our Services and also provide you
       with better recommendations on how to get the most out of our
       platform and to accomplish your goals.
     * Fourth, in some cases we may process your Personal Information
       where necessary to satisfy our legal obligations. This includes
       records containing your Personal Information that we may be
       required to retain for a period of time or may be required to
       disclose to a government authority or third party.

Data Subject Rights Requests

   If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, you have the right to
   request access to Personal Information we hold about you and to ask
   that your Personal Information be corrected, erased, or transferred.
   You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict,
   certain processing activities.

   If you submitted Personal Information directly to us or in accordance
   with the provision of our Services and you would like to view, change,
   limit or delete your Personal Information, you can do so via your
   account settings or by contacting us. Upon request, we will notify you
   about whether we hold any of your Personal Information. By visiting
   your account settings, you can access, correct, change and delete
   certain of your Personal Information associated with your account. In
   certain cases where we process your information, you may also have a
   right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your Personal
   Information. In certain circumstances, you also have the right to
   object to the processing of your Personal Information, to request the
   deletion of your Personal Information and to obtain a copy of your
   Personal Information in machine-readable format.

   If you need assistance accessing or modifying your Personal Information
   or wish to delete your Personal Information, please email us at
   info@activecampaign.com.

Withdrawing Consent

   You have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your
   Personal Information where we process it based on your consent.. You
   can do this at any time by opting out of commercial emails we send you
   by clicking on the unsubscribe links in those emails, or emailing us
   with your request at info.activecampaign.com, or by simply cancelling
   your account through your account settings and then emailing
   info@activecampaign.com to request that your Personal Information be
   deleted.

   If you withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal
   Information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, you may
   not have access to some (or any) of the Services, and we might not be
   able to provide you some (or any) of the Services. Please note that, in
   certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you
   have withdrawn consent and requested that we delete your Personal
   Information, if we have a legal basis to do so. For example, we may
   retain certain information if we need to do so to comply with an
   independent legal obligation, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue
   our legitimate interest in keeping the Services safe and secure.

Questions or Complaints

   If you are a resident of the EEA and have a concern about our
   processing of your Personal Information that we are not able to
   resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data
   protection authority where you reside. For contact details of your
   local Data Protection Authority, please see:
   http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-p
   rotection-authorities/index_en.htm.

Platinum Skin Care’s Story

     ActiveCampaign allows me to have a conversation with people and
     tailor it to what their needs are. With tags, I can say “this
     person’s in this product lane, that person’s in that product lane,
     that person’s in that product lane,” and I can segment my audience
     into different types of people so we’re giving them the right things
     and they’re really happy in the end.

The Produce Mom’s Story

     Through the ActiveCampaign platform, we are able to create a
     marketing funnel of school foodservice directors throughout the
     United States and provide them with content that is very specific to

Heather Read’s Story

     As a photographer and a mother, it’s so important for me to have
     that extra time that I save using ActiveCampaign because I can focus
     more on my art and I can focus more on building relationships with
     the clients versus the tedious mundane things that so much time
     didn’t need to be spent on.

     I used to get 20% open rates and I thought I was doing really good.

     first few emails are all in the 80% to 50% range.

Die Geschichte von Platinum Skin Care

     Mit ActiveCampaign kann ich mich mit Menschen unterhalten und sie
     auf deren Bedürfnisse zuschneiden. Mit Tags kann ich sagen: "Diese

     verschiedene Arten von Personen aufteilen, damit wir die richtigen
     Dinge geben und sie am Ende wirklich glücklich sind.

     kann, im Gegensatz zu den mühsamen alltäglichen Dingen, die wirklich

David Paiges Geschichte

     Früher habe ich 20% offene Raten bekommen und dachte, ich mache das
     wirklich gut. Seit ich dann zu ActiveCampaign wechselte und mit der

Platinum Skin Care’s Story

     ActiveCampaign allows me to have a conversation with people and
     tailor it to what their needs are. With tags, I can say “this
     person’s in this product lane, that person’s in that product lane,
     that person’s in that product lane,” and I can segment my audience
     into different types of people so we’re giving them the right things
     and they’re really happy in the end.
