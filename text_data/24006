Work Abroad, Live More Adventurously

   make travel a lifestyle, not a vacation
   Start Here

   Hi! I’m Nina. I bought a one-way ticket to Thailand to travel for a
   year and I never went back… I’ve been abroad since 2011 and started
   this blog to help others.

   I’m here to give you the low-down on how to work abroad and travel like
   a badass.

   You’ll find adventurous itineraries, detailed guides to some of my
   favorite places, and inspiring articles on how to sustain life on the
   road without any BS. We’re friends now, so get comfortable, keep
   reading, and I hope you find the information here helpful!
