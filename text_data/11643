   YouPHPTube (YPT) is an open source solution that is freely available to
   everyone. The idea came from the need to disseminate videos with
   sensitive content using the internal, network infrastructure of an
   institution. Soon the idea grew and took up space on the internet, as
   an alternative to itself to replace, in a distributed way, the great
   video sites like: YouTube, Vimeo, etc. With YouPHPTube, you can create
   your own video sharing site as well as stream live videos, always
   inspired by the latest technologies. Among some of the features,
   YouPHPTube allows you to import and encode videos from other sites
   directly from the Internet, as well as support for mobile devices,
   through the responsive layout of the site or through a hybrid
   application that allows you to directly view and stream videos of your
   phone.
