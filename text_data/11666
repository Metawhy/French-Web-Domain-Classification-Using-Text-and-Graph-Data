Join the 50th Brigade:

   Cuba is the only country on earth that US citizens can‚Äôt travel to
   freely. In the 50 year tradition of the Venceremos Brigade, this July
   (2019), we will travel to Cuba to practice solidarity with the Cuban
   People and their struggles, many of which are due U.S. policy. We do
   this through voluntary labor, donations of material aid, relationships
   building and dialogue between our peoples. We have much to learn from
   each other about building a more just and equitable world. During the
   50th brigade, more Americans than ever will have the opportunity to
   travel to Cuba within these values.

APPLY NOW to Participate in the 50th Anniversary Contingent of the Venceremos
Brigade!

   We invite you to join the brigade in ethical travel to Cuba this
   summer, as part of an intentional community of revolutionary practice,
   to celebrate a half-century of international solidarity and struggle,
   to see Cuba with your own eyes, to transform your perspective and our
   movement work!

   IMPORTANT UPDATES ON VB50:

   All trip options for the VB 50th Anniversary Contingent will now travel
   direct between the U.S. and Cuba!

   What does this mean?

   1. The Travel Challenge is evolving as developments in the political
   climate create new conditions for Cuba Solidarity work. Now more than
   ever, it is a priority that the VB brings the largest and most
   accessible brigade in recent history. With continued and expanding
   attacks on progressive movements and governments across Latin America
   (and worldwide), and in the context of mounting threats,
   fear-mongering, and hostility in the U.S. government‚Äôs stance toward
   Cuba specifically, political and ethical travel to Cuba has become, in
   and of itself, a challenge. At this critical moment, the VB and our
   Cuban partners have decided that our political objective ‚Äì of building
   the strongest possible contingent to engage in a project that is about
   the survival of the Cuban Revolution ‚Äì is best served with new tactics.
   And therefore, this year the brigade will be taking advantage of the
   General License for People-to-People Educational Exchange.

   2.  The VB‚Äôs program in Cuba, of solidarity work, educational
   exchanges, and political activities, is not changing. We will still
   have 4 trip options (see below), but they will all travel directly
   between the US and Cuba. Please note that now all trip options are open
   to all applicants, and the 5-day trip includes an option for hotel
   accommodation, reserved for people who identify as seniors or elders,
   people with disabilities, and their care providers; all others
   traveling on the 5-day trip will stay with the larger group at the
   International Camp.

   3. Due to these changes, the application deadline has been extended to
   April 10th, with application fee ($100) and deposit ($500) due no later
   than May 1st. The final payment for accepted brigadistas is due no
   later than June 1st. Partial financial assistance is available and is
   applied to the final payment.

   We are more than half way to our goal of 300 people for the 50th and
   expect to sell out. We encourage folks to APPLY now to secure your
   spot. If you have questions about these changes, please email
   vbrigade@gmail.com.

   OPTION 1A: 5 days (Havana area and neighboring provinces only, July
   28-August 1) ‚Äì cost TBD *accommodations at camp; full brigade program
   in Havana and nearby provinces.

   OPTION 1B: 5 days (Havana area and neighboring provinces only, July
   28-August 1) ‚Äì cost TBD *accommodations at hotel for people with
