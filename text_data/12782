A University of the First Class

   We started with a constitutional mandate to be “a university of the
   first class.” Since 1883, we’ve been refining and updating what that
   means, but we’ve never stopped pursuing that ideal.

   We say, “What starts here changes the world.”

   But, what makes here so special?

   cost, and a culture that welcomes talented, diverse students with
   unlimited potential.

We’re Revolutionizing Health Care

   Health care costs too much and moves too slowly. We’re attacking these
   and other problems with the urgency they deserve. Whether you’re in
   medicine, engineering, business or design, you can be part of the
   solution.

     UT has an amazing combination of scientists and engineers addressing
     critical challenges in human health. The technology being developed
     at UT will not only save lives but transform patient care and
     medicine.”
