   person holding plastic bags State legislatures have considered a number
   of measures to reduce the prevalence of plastic bags at grocery stores
   and other businesses.

   Reducing bag use can mitigate harmful impacts to oceans, rivers, lakes,
   forests and the wildlife that inhabit them. It can also relieve
   pressure on landfills and waste management.

   While some states are focusing on implementing effective recycling
   programs, others are imposing bans or fees to discourage the use of
   plastic bags altogether.

Bans and Fees

   Eight states—California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New
   York, Oregon and Vermont—have banned single-use plastic bags.

   In August 2014, California became the first state to enact legislation
   imposing a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags at large retail
   stores. The bill also required a 10-cent minimum charge for recycled
   paper bags, reusable plastic bags, and compostable bags at certain
   locations. The ban was set to take effect on July 1, 2015, but a
   referendum forced the issue onto the ballot in the November 2016
   election. Proposition 67 passed with 52 percent of the vote, meaning
   the plastic bag ban approved by the Legislature remains the law. A
   detailed summary of the law can be found below. Voters also rejected a
   second measure, Proposition 65, which proposed to create an
   environmental fund with proceeds from a 10-cent charge for alternative
   bags.

   Hawaii has a de facto statewide ban as all of its most populous
   counties prohibit non-biodegradable plastic bags at checkout, as well
   as paper bags containing less than 40 percent recycled material. Bans
   in Kauai, Maui and Hawaii counties took effect between 2011 and 2013,
   with Honolulu becoming the last major county to approve the ban in
   2015.

   New York became the third state to ban plastic bags in 2019 with
   passage of Senate Bill 1508. The law, which goes into effect March
   2020, will apply to most single-use plastic bags provided by grocery
   stores and other retailers. Bags distributed at the meat/deli counter
   and bulk food area are exempt, as well as newspaper bags, trash bags,
   garment bags, bags provided by a pharmacy for prescription drugs, and
   restaurant takeout bags. The law allows individual counties the option
   of placing a 5-cent fee on paper bags, with 2 cents going to local
   governments and 3 cents to the state's Environmental Protection Fund.

   Five other states enacted legislation in 2019—Connecticut, Delaware,
   Maine, Oregon and Vermont. In addition to plastic bags, Vermont's SB
   113 also placed restrictions on single-use straws and polystrene
   containers.

   In 2009, the District of Columbia enacted legislation requiring all
   businesses that sell food or alcohol to charge 5 cents for each
   carryout paper or plastic bag.

Recycling Programs

   States have a long history of pursuing legislation related to labeling,
   recycling, and reusing plastic bags. In 1991, Maine became the first
   state to enact legislation requiring recycling efforts at retail
   stores. The law prevents retailers from supplying plastic bags unless
   they provide a convenient storefront receptacle to ensure used bags are
   collected and recycled. Since then at least four other
   states—California, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island—and the District
   of Columbia have followed suit.

Legislation Summary

   State lawmakers have introduced at least 95 bills in 2019 related to
   plastic bags. Most of these bills would ban or place a fee on plastic
   bags. Others would preempt local government action or improve bag
   recycling programs.

Net Neutrality 2019 Legislation

net neutrality image

   After the Federal Communications Commission Restoring Internet Freedom
   Order and transparency rule amendments became effective June 11, 2018,
   overturning earlier requirements on net neutrality requirements on
   internet service providers, state legislators responded by introducing
   net neutrality legislation at the state level.

   Net neutrality is the concept that all data traffic on a network should
   be treated indiscriminately, where internet service providers (ISPs)
   would be restricted from blocking, slowing down or speeding up the
   delivery of online content at their discretion. The current debate
   surrounding net neutrality is principally about how ISPs should be
   regulated and what role government should play in overseeing their
   network management practices.

   The rule change places primary jurisdiction over internet service
   providers’ network management practices under the Federal Trade
   Commission and preempts states from enacting similar ISP network
   restrictions as found in the 2015 Open Internet Order.

   Attorneys general from 22 states filed a protective petition for review
   against the FCC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
   Columbia. Five states—California, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont and
   Washington—enacted legislation or adopted resolutions in previous
   legislative sessions. In a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice,
   California agreed to not enforce its net neutrality law until
   the lawsuit challenging the Federal Communications Commission's repeal
   of the federal regulations is resolved.

   Twenty-nine states have introduced net neutrality legislation in the
   2019 legislative session.

   Separately, legislators have introduced measures that would restrict
   ISPs’ use of customer information and adopt privacy protections. For
   example, two states, Nevada and Minnesota prohibit disclosure of
   personally identifying information, but Minnesota also requires ISPs to
