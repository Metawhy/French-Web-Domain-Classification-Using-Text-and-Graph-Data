POLICY ON PRIVACY AND PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

   The processing, privacy and security of your personal data is extremely
   important to us. We make every effort to provide you personalized
   services in a way that honors your wishes and privacy. The purpose of
   this policy on privacy and personal data protection (hereinafter the
   “Privacy Policy”) is to give you straightforward, clear and
   comprehensive information on how the data you provide to us is used,
   including the data we may acquire about you through various channels
   (store, customer service department, givenchy.com, social media, apps,
   and events), whether it is shared with third parties, and the rights
   and options available to you for controlling your personal data and
   protecting your privacy.

About us

   This Privacy Policy outlines how GIVENCHY, a French business
   corporation headquartered at 3, avenue George V 75008 Paris, France,
   and/or its affiliates (hereinafter “GIVENCHY”) uses personal data that

   the products and services requested. The other information is optional
   and enables Us to know You better and improve the messages and services

       on this platform. However, We would like to remind you that
       GIVENCHY cannot guarantee Your data or other information shared on
       these programs will remain confidential and secure since it is out
       of GIVENCHY's control and it waives all liability.

   Economic Area. Therefore, We recommend that You familiarize yourself

   sales documents in order to meet legal and governmental requirements as
   well as for the purposes of our insurers and audits. Depending on the
   manner in which your data are collected, the legal grounds for
   processing them may be:

   to your customer account)
   - A legal obligation if the data processing is required by law (i.e.

   the current objective, to satisfy Your needs or to meet Our legal
   obligations. In general, Your personal data are only retained in Our
   database for a period that is reasonably necessary to fulfill the
   purposes outlined above or for the retention period permitted by law.
     *  If You are a customer (i.e. you have purchased a GIVENCHY
       product): For a period not to exceed five years from your initial
       purchase. This period is renewed each time You interact with
       GIVENCHY (i.e. you make another purchase)

       GIVENCHY advertises): Two years from when You apply

   If cookies are installed on Your computer, We cannot retain them for
   more than 13 months. Once We no longer require Your personal data, they
   are deleted from Our systems and records or anonymized so You cannot be
   identified.

   Your data are intended for the GIVENCHY departments that handle Your
   requests. We ensure that Your personal data are only accessible to

     * Other GIVENCHY establishments in order to provide You the same
       personalized service worldwide
     * Our trusted third-party service providers, including other entities
       in the LVMH Group in their capacity as subcontractor acting on Our
       directives and solely on Our behalf

   For example, We entrust some services to third parties that deliver a
   product to You, service providers with payment and secure transaction
   platforms with fraud prevention, vendors that help Us coordinate Our
   events, suppliers of IT services, web marketing and public relations
   agencies, and vendors that assist Us with customer service
     * Third parties in the event of a change in management for legal
       reasons or with Our prior consent.

   login information. In this case, be aware that You are sharing your
   profile information with Us. We would like to inform you that these
   social networks operate under their own privacy policies.

   history). We do so securely in compliance with the applicable law and
   make every effort to ensure that third parties honor the commitment
   stated in this Privacy Policy. Due to their position, GIVENCHY
