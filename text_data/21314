   The STEM Group is a french world leading electron microscopy group,
   specialising in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Our
   scientific interests are large, and are including different parts of
   the physics and material sciences: nanoparticles, interfaces,
   nanophotonic... We are constantly developing instrumentation and
   methods in the fields of electron microscopies and spectroscopies.

   The group coordinates the TEMPOS equipex http://www.tempos.fr.
