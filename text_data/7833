Angry Virgin Threatened to Kill ‘as Many Girls as I See’ Near Women’s March

   Christopher Cleary was arrested for writing he wanted to be the ‘next
   mass shooter’ and kill women who ‘turned me down.’ Cops worried he was
   targeting an anti-Trump demonstration.

   A Colorado man who raged online about his virginity threatened to kill
   “as many girls as I see,” leading police to fear he was targeting a
   nearby Women’s March event.

   Christopher Cleary, 27, was arrested Saturday after writing a long
   Facebook diatribe about being a virgin and wanting to become “the next
   mass shooter.” Cleary told police he was just venting, but he was
   already on probation from a 2018 conviction for stalking and making a
   repeated communication of domestic violence. And a series of murderous
   young men who call themselves “incels” (“involuntarily celibate”) have
   recently used singledom as an excuse for deadly attacks on women.

   Cleary traveled to Provo, Utah and checked into an AirBnB on January
   18, the day before the city’s planned Women’s March, according to
   Denver’s ABC7. Late that night, his Facebook friends started calling
   police to report a series of threatening posts he allegedly authored.

   “All I wanted was a girlfriend, not 1000… not a bunch of hoes,” Cleary
   allegedly wrote. “I’ve never had a girlfriend before and I’m still a
   virgin, this is why I’m planning on shooting up a public place soon and
   being the next mass shooter cause I’m ready to die and all the girls
   the turned me down is going to make it right by killing as many girls
   as I see.” He allegedly added that “there’s nothing more dangerous than
   man ready to die.”

   Police traced his phone and arrested him the morning of the march at a
   Provo McDonald’s. Cleary told police that he had an impulse disorder,
   and that he had been upset when he authored the posts, according to
   police.

   But it wasn’t his first or even second scrape with the law. At the time
   of his Saturday arrest, he was less than a year into a three-year
   probation for felony stalking, according to court records reviewed by
   The Daily Beast. He pleaded guilty to a similar felony stalking charge
   in 2016. In a case stemming from a 2015 arrest, he was charged with
   posting a private image for harassment, posting a private image for
   monetary gain, harassment by striking or kicking a person, and
   harassment by repeated phone calls. He pleaded guilty to the final
   charge, and the former were dismissed.

   He pleaded guilty to making threats and causing “disturbances via
   phone” in 2013, and assault in 2009.

   Had he carried out an attack, Cleary would have been the latest in a
   series of men to murder women for refusing to date him. In 2014,
   22-year-old Elliot Rodger opened fire on students at the University of
   California, Santa Barbara. Rodger was highly active in a misogynistic
   internet community of young men who felt jilted by women. In YouTube
   videos and manifestos, Rodger described murdering women as
   “retribution” for their lack of interest in him. He murdered six people
   and injured another 14 before shooting himself to death.

   Since the massacre, men who share Rodgers’ hatred of women and sense of
   rejection have coalesced into a more-defined internet movement. The
   group call themselves “incels” and  promotes violent misogyny. Cleary
   wrote in language similar to that of incel forums, although his
   belonging to the group is subject to debate.

   The term “incel” originated with a liberal blogger, who wrote about
   normalizing virginity, particularly for people who were isolated from
   the dating world for reasons of disability or sexual orientation.
   Cleary fit those broad terms of a person who wished to have sex, but
   remained a virgin. But the modern incel culture has morphed into a more
   explicit ideology of male supremacy, which does not apply to every
   adult virgin. It’s an opt-in culture, one that shares Cleary’s apparent
   rage at virginity, although he is not reported to have shared content
   from incel sites.

   Try as they may to blame their woes on women, forum-goers brutally
   criticize each others’ appearances, convincing each other that they’ll
   never find a date, Vice reported last year. In a survey of 300 users on
   a major incel forum, more than half of respondents said they’d
   considered plastic surgery. Loneliness (only 36.7 percent of
   respondents said they had friends) and general hatred of humanity (52.9
   percent of respondents self-identified as misanthropes) are standard.
   More than half of respondents were white, and almost all of them under
   30 years old.

   Other killers appear to have traveled in those digital circles. A man
   accused of killing 10 people and injuring 16 more in a 2018 van attack
   in Toronto allegedly glorified Rodgers on Facebook. Another man accused
   of killing two women in a Florida yoga studio in November uploaded
   YouTube videos calling women “whores” and promoting Rodgers.

   Cleary’s apparent absence from incel forums hasn’t stopped them from
   glamorizing his alleged murder plot, or talking about recruiting him.

   “I hope someone tells him about this site,” one incel forum user wrote.

First State Legalizes Taser Drones for Cops, Thanks to a Lobbyist

   North Dakota police can now fire everything from stun guns to tear gas
   from flying robots thanks to a lobbyist from Big Drone.

   It is now legal for law enforcement in North Dakota to fly drones armed
   with everything from Tasers to tear gas thanks to a last-minute push by
   a pro-police lobbyist.

   With all the concern over the militarization of police in the past
   year, no one noticed that the state became the first in the union to
   allow police to equip drones with “less than lethal” weapons. House
   Bill 1328 wasn’t drafted that way, but then a lobbyist representing law
   enforcement—tight with a booming drone industry—got his hands on it.

   The bill’s stated intent was to require police to obtain a search
   warrant from a judge in order to use a drone to search for criminal
   evidence. In fact, the original draft of Representative Rick Becker’s
   bill would have banned all weapons on police drones.

   Then Bruce Burkett of the North Dakota Peace Officer’s Association was
   allowed by the state house committee to amend HB 1328 and limit the
   prohibition only to lethal weapons. “Less than lethal” weapons like
   rubber bullets, pepper spray, tear gas, sound cannons, and Tasers are
   therefore permitted on police drones.

   Becker, the bill’s Republican sponsor, said he had to live with it.

   “This is one I’m not in full agreement with. I wish it was any weapon,”
   he said at a hearing in March. “In my opinion there should be a nice,
   red line: Drones should not be weaponized. Period.”

   Even “less than lethal” weapons can kill though. At least 39 people
   have been killed by police Tasers in 2015 so far, according to The
   Guardian. Bean bags, rubber bullets, and flying tear gas canisters have
   also maimed, if not killed, in the U.S. and abroad.

   Becker said he worried about police firing on criminal suspects
   remotely, not unlike U.S. Air Force pilots who bomb the so-called
   Islamic State, widely known as ISIS, from more than 5,000 miles away.

   “When you’re not on the ground, and you’re making decisions, you’re
   sort of separate,” Becker said in March. “Depersonalized.”

   Drones have been in use for decades by the military, but their high
   prices have prevented police departments from obtaining them until
   recently. Money’s no problem for the the Grand Forks County Sheriff’s
   Department, though: A California manufacturer loaned them two drones.

   Grand Forks County Sheriff Bob Rost said his department’s drones are
   only equipped with cameras and he doesn’t think he should need a
   warrant to go snooping.

   “It was a bad bill to start with,” Rost told The Daily Beast. “We just
   thought the whole thing was ridiculous.”

   Rost said he needs to use drones for surveillance in order to obtain a
   warrant in the first place.

   “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear,” Becker
   remembered opponents like Rost saying.

   Yet the sheriff’s department is hiding a full accounting of how many
   drone missions they’ve flown since 2012. Records requests by The Daily
   Beast were initially denied by the sheriff because they would “cost a
   fortune,” and were only handed over after an appeal to the state’s
   attorney general’s office.

   The sheriff and lobbyists assured lawmakers that drones would only be
   used in non-criminal situations, like the search for a missing person
   or to photograph an accident scene. What they didn’t mention was the
   2011 arrest of Rodney Brossart, a cattle thief who was caught by a
   Department of Homeland Security drone.

   When a few cows wandered onto his land, Brossart refused to take them
   back to their owner, his neighbor. The neighbor called the police and
   the situation turned into a 16-hour standoff. Fearful of entering his
   ranch without knowing where Brossart was, police asked Homeland
   Security to redirect a Predator searching the border with Canada.

   The drone meant to find drug smugglers instead found Brossart—on his
   own property—and he was arrested.

   Law enforcement wasn’t the only one who disapproved of the legislation.
   A representative from the North Dakota Department of Commerce, the vice
   president of an economic development group, the founder of a drone
   company, and the director of the University of North Dakota’s drone
   major program all testified against the bill.

   Why would a bunch of business types want to stop something like
   warrants for drones?

   “I think when you’re trying to stimulate an industry in your state, you
   don’t want things that would potentially have a chilling effect on
   [drone] manufacturers,” said Al Frazier, a Grand Forks sheriff’s deputy
   who pilots the drones.

   Organizations like the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems
   International track legislation, especially any laws that appear to
   limit drone “development,” according to Keith Lund of the Grand Forks
   Regional Economic Development Corporation.

   “Requiring a search warrant for surveillance is ‘restricting
   development’?” asked Rep. Gary Paur, a Republican, at a hearing.

   “It’s really all about the commercial development, which is where all
   of this is heading,” Lund replied. “If [a law] is somehow limiting
   commercial, law enforcement development... that is a negative in terms
   of companies looking and investing in opportunities in the state of
   North Dakota,” Lund said.

   In other words, limit civil liberties so Big Drone can spread its
   wings.

   Drones in North Dakota are a profitable enterprise in a state hit hard
   by the oil bust. Companies that market machines for agricultural and
   commercial use have been popping up in industrial parks on the
   outskirts of Grand Forks for the better part of the last three years.
   The university, one of the city’s largest employers, even offers a
   four-year degree in drones. The Air Force has partnered with the
   private sector to create a drone research and development park, too.

   In January, on a ribbon of video screen that wraps its way around UND’s
   Ralph Engelstad Arena, the bubble nose of an RQ-4 Global Hawk, the
   Predator drone, glided silently past the backdrop of a clear blue sky.
   That image—an advertisement for Northrop Grumman—appeared during the
   second intermission of a sold-out hockey game.

   “This is the first year they’ve advertised here,” a friend said to me.

   ***

   Perhaps Brossart’s arrest was included in the 401 drone operations the
   FAA says were undertaken by the Grand Forks County Sheriff’s Department
   in the past three years. But that number doesn’t square with the 21
   missions flown by the agency in the same time period, all detailed in
   documents obtained by The Daily Beast through open-records requests.

   In addition to the flawed comparison to helicopters and the milquetoast
   descriptions of drone use, police continually cited Federal Aviation
   Administration rules that require law enforcement organizations
   authorized to operate drones to notify the FAA when the devices are
   deployed as a reason why HB 1328 was unnecessary.

   This also appears to be an incomplete analysis.

   According to documents obtained by MuckRock, the FAA notes 401 drone
   “operations” performed by the Grand Forks County Sheriff’s Department
   from 2012 to September 2014, while Rost and Frazier maintain just 21
   missions have taken place. Those 401 operations noted by the FAA have
   resulted in 80.5 hours of flights, a number that can’t be independently
   verified because a lawyer representing the sheriff’s department did not
   include duration of flights for the 21 missions detailed in response to
   an open-records request from The Daily Beast. (HB 1328 requires police
   to retain data, including flight duration, for five years after it is
   collected.)

   Rost and Frazier did not reply to multiple requests for comment
   regarding the discrepancy between the FAA’s numbers and their own, and
   the FAA hasn’t provided an explanation for how it defines “operations.”

   Similar to those who have supported the NSA’s massive data collection
   program, Rost and others repeatedly fell back to an argument that was
   cited untold times over the last two years as Becker fought for his
   bill.

   “We don’t make a practice of snooping on people,” Rost said recently.

   However, Rost’s statement was followed by an admission that the sheriff
   expects drones to be used in criminal investigations in the near
   future.

   Rost argued against the bill on the basis that police would in good
   faith obtain warrants if they decided to use drones for surveillance,
   and that judges be allowed to “do their job.”

   “I understand that judges regulate whether you would have to get a
   warrant, but there’s nothing currently in the law setting perimeters
   for UAS [unmanned aircraft systems],” a North Dakota lawmaker told Rost
   at a February hearing. “What’s wrong with having something in law?”

   Verbally diminishing the power of drones and what they would be used
   for in the bill’s hearings was the second of a two-part strategy from
   law enforcement. The first was a public relations push that included
   months’ worth of op-eds in the state’s two largest newspapers, the
   Grand Forks Herald and the Fargo Forum. Usually penned by Frazier, the
   UND aviation professor who also pilots two of the drones used by the
   Grand Forks County Sheriff’s Department, the public face of police
   drones has at times been different from comments made outside the
   media.

   “To read Rep. Becker’s bill, you would think that these would be highly
   effective surveillance tools that could be put up over locations for
   persistent surveillances and violate people’s constitutional rights,”
   Frazier told the Herald in January. “And the reality is none of that is
   correct."

   Compare that to Frazier’s remarks at a 2011 UAS conference attended by
   many members of law enforcement. Sarah Nelson, a journalist and
   Bismarck native who has studied police use of drones, was also there.
   She testified in a March hearing on HB 1328, and told the committee
   about Frazier’s comments at the 2011 conference, which stand in stark
   contrast to his printed words.

   “[Frazier] spoke openly about the potential use of unmanned systems in
   North Dakota,” at the conference, Nelson said. “The list included the
   deployment of a hovering drone that was ‘Not audible or visible to
   people below in order to collect real time intelligence video.’”

   Grand Forks is probably the only place in the country where you’ll find
   advertisements for Predator drones, the operators of which are trained
   and stationed at the nearby Air Force base. There, past the airport a
   few miles outside the western edge of the city, the landscape gives way
   to the prairie that covers the vast middle of North Dakota. But before
   civilization is left behind on a westward route, the city, its
   politicians, the base, and the powerful interests of the drone program
   at the University of North Dakota are adding a futuristic appendage:
   Grand Sky.

   Billed as a UAS research and development facility, Grand Sky will
   combine all the benefits of private entrepreneurship and government
   capital. Tenants there will have access to some of the the Air Force
   base’s facilities, and drone companies are clamoring to get their
   spots. On its website, Grand Sky is billed as an opportunity to “Create
   History Where the Future is Wide Open.”

   It is certainly that: The residents of Grand Forks, like those
   throughout the state who have taken a laissez-faire attitude to oil
   companies reaping millions from North Dakota ground, appear concerned
   primarily with the economic benefits of drone technology. Becker, the
   Republican state legislator who sponsored HB 1328, said heartburn over
   individual privacy, constitutional rights, and, on a larger scale, the
   ethics of killing people a half a world away by wielding a joystick,
   doesn’t seem to exist for many in the state.

   Part of the reason for this, Frazier argued, is a compliance committee
   keeps police use of drones in check. A body with no legal authority,
   the committee tracks and reviews how police use their drones and
   discusses possible privacy concerns. Frazier and others in law
   enforcement—as well as representatives from the private sector and
   those from UND—cited the committee watchdog role as yet another reason
   why HB 1328 was unnecessary.

   But the group isn’t exactly comprised of a diverse cross section of
   political thought. Of the committee’s 18 members, six are from UND,
   which has a vested interest in promoting drone use. Three are members
   of local government, including the city planner and an assistant
   state’s attorney. And the rest are either current or former members of
   law enforcement and emergency services.

   Frazier said that the sheriff’s department had nothing to do with the
   makeup of the group, which was created by charter. The committee is not
   a “rubber stamp,” he added. And besides, there simply hasn’t been much
   public outcry over police use of drones, or really any interest in
   tracking how police use them.

   Drones are overwhelmingly seen as a good thing in North Dakota, which
   is perhaps why few noticed when HB 1328 passed with a clause allowing
   them to be armed with non-lethal weapons.

   ***

   “I agree completely with the idea that there should be public oversight
   of a public asset, but to a great degree disagree with the idea that
   the public is overly concerned with it,” Frazier said. “I think the
   media is making a big deal out of something that isn’t a big deal.”

   It may be that the sheriff’s use of drones is completely innocuous,
   that there is some kind of technical verbiage-related mixup that would
   explain the discrepancy between the FAA’s numbers and those provided by
   Frazier and Rost. It also may be that the pair had nothing to do with
   the non-lethal exception included in HB 1328, which they say is the
   case. Both said they pulled out of any negotiations over the bill’s
   language, thinking it was “doomed,” Rost said.

   It wasn’t, thanks to Becker, who succeeded in creating a check against
   law enforcement with the warrant requirement, but failed to prevent
   police from arming drones that are increasingly filling North Dakota
   skies.

   In attempting to convince legislators to pass HB 1328, Nelson, the
   journalist and Bismarck native, said it wasn’t distrust of police that
   prompted the bill to be crafted, but a democratic duty to maintain
   trust in government.

   “When grappling with how to regulate powerful technologies, it’s a
   common practice of both law enforcement and the larger intelligence
   community to say that technologies are being used on very bad people in
   very extreme cases. This is an effective strategy because the public
   sees themselves as vastly different from those bad people,” she said in
   March. “In response to this argument, I would urge the committee to
   remember that liberty is eroded at the fringes.”

The Truth About Trump’s Insane Ukraine ‘Server’ Conspiracy

   Trump asked Ukraine’s president to help prove a bonkers,
   Russia-friendly conspiracy theory that U.S. intel relied on
   manufactured evidence to blame the 2016 DNC hack on Moscow.

Kevin Poulsen9.25.19 4:38 PM ET

   Donald Trump asked for more than a criminal investigation of his
   political opponent’s son in his call with Ukraine’s president. Trump
   also sought help in reviving a long-ago debunked conspiracy theory that
   challenges the basic underpinnings of the U.S. intelligence community’s
   findings on Russia’s 2016 election interference, in a bizarre spectacle
   that sees an American president trying to conscript a foreign leader
   into undermining his own intelligence agencies.

   “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation
   with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike,” Trump said, according to a
   compilation of notes on the call released by he White House. “I guess
   you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has
   it.”

   To those not versed in fringe-right canon it’s a curious thing to say.
   “It almost sounds like he was babbling to the president of Ukraine,”
   said Robert Johnston, CEO of Adlumin, who led the DNC breach
   investigation while at Crowdstrike. “I imagine it would have confused
   the Ukranian president. Like, ‘What are you talking about?’”

   Conservative websites are spinning the odd exchange as a reference to a
   Justice Department investigation ordered by William Barr into the
   origins of the Mueller probe. “It is unclear specifically what Trump
   was referring to with Crowdstrike,” reads one article in this vein on
   The Federalist. In truth, it’s actually quite clear. Trump is
   referencing a conspiracy theory pushed by Russian trolls and far-right
   pundits that imagines the Democratic National Committee fabricating all
   the evidence in Russia’s 2016 breach of the DNC network.
   “Trump has shown a pronounced preference for the pretend version of
   events.”

   The hoax has its roots in a GRU persona, “Guccifer 2.0,” created to
   cast doubt on Russia’s culpability in the DNC hack. Today it’s
   buttressed by deceptive blog posts, memes and putative forensic
   analysis of metadata in documents leaked from the DNC and John Podesta
   intrusions, and has spun out several related theories and offshoots,
   including the Seth Rich hoax that blames the hack on a slain DNC
   staffer with previously-unknown hacking skills.

   Crowdstrike enters the picture because it’s the security firm the DNC
   hired to investigate the breach back in 2016, and the first of many to
   identify Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, as the
   perpetrator. A publicly-traded company headquartered in California,
   Crowdstrike has nothing to do with Ukraine, except in conspiracyland,
   which pretends that Crowdstrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is
   Ukranian, and that he framed Russia for election interference both on
   the DNC’s orders and to punish Putin for invading his homeland.

   In real life, Alperovitch is American citizen born in Russia who
   escaped to the U.S. with his family during the Soviet era. But Trump
   has shown a pronounced preference for the pretend version.

   “Why wouldn’t Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the
   server?” Trump asked the AP in 2017. “They brought in another company
   that I hear is Ukrainian-based … I heard it’s owned by a very rich
   Ukrainian, that’s what I heard.”

   The “server” in the conspiracy is the hacked DNC server that the
   democrats, the claim goes won’t let the FBI examine, because it would
   expose their elaborate plot. “What is the server saying?” Trump asked
   in one tweet last year.

   That part’s made up, too. The DNC turned down one unusual FBI request
   early in the hack investigation. The bureau wanted access to the DNC’s
   network while the Russians were still in it, most likely to stage a
   counter operation against the GRU. The DNC declined, perhaps reluctant
   to have two intelligence agencies playing capture-the-flag in their
   systems five months before a presidential election. The DNC later
   authorized Crowdstrike to share full copies of the hacked servers with
   the bureau, giving the FBI access to the same evidence Crowdstrike
   had.

   “With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided
   all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI,” Crowdstrike said in a
   statement Wednesday. “As we’ve stated before, we stand by our findings
   and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence
   community.”

   In truth, Crowdstrike’s findings were never controversial among
   security experts, and they were later confirmed by FBI agents with
   access to the same evidence, as well as additional evidence Crowdstrike
   never had. In October 2018, Robert Mueller indicted 12 GRU officers for
   the DNC intrusion and hacks targeting John Podesta and the DCCC.

   Today the secret server hoax is mostly confined to the very edge of the
   conservative fringe, though it’s made an appearance in court. Indicted
   former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone has been using the theory to
   try and get evidence against him thrown out of court, even filing an
   affidavit written by William Binney, one of the conspiracy theory’s
   most dogged advocates.  Last week the federal judge overseeing Stone’s
   obstruction of justice case rejected his motion without ruling on the
   conspiracy theory itself.

EXCLUSIVE: ‘Lone DNC Hacker’ Guccifer 2.0 Slipped Up and Revealed He Was a
Russian Intelligence Officer

   Update, 7/13/2018: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office identified
   Guccifer 2.0 as a Russian intelligence officer and indicted him along
   with 11 other officers for crimes related to the alleged hacking of
   Democrats in 2016.

   Guccifer 2.0, the “lone hacker” who took credit for providing WikiLeaks
   with stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, was in fact
   an officer of Russia’s military intelligence directorate (GRU), The
   Daily Beast has learned. It’s an attribution that resulted from a
   fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft.

   That forensic determination has substantial implications for the
   criminal probe into potential collusion between President Donald Trump
   and Russia. The Daily Beast has learned that the special counsel in
   that investigation, Robert Mueller, has taken over the probe into
   Guccifer and brought the FBI agents who worked to track the persona
   onto his team.

   While it’s unclear what Mueller plans to do with Guccifer, his last
   round of indictments charged 13 Russians tied to the Internet Research
   Agency troll farm with a conspiracy “for the purpose of interfering
   with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the
   presidential election of 2016.” It was Mueller’s first move
   establishing Russian interference in the election within a criminal
   context, but it stopped short of directly implicating the Putin regime.

   Mueller’s office declined to comment for this story. But the
   attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest foreign
   intelligence agency would cross the Kremlin threshold—and move the
   investigation closer to Trump himself.
   “The attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest
   foreign intelligence agency brings the investigation closer to the
   Kremlin’s doorstep—and to Trump himself.”

   Trump’s longtime political adviser Roger Stone admitted being in touch
   with Guccifer over Twitter’s direct messaging service. And in August
   2016, Stone published an article on the pro-Trump-friendly Breitbart
   News calling on his political opponents to “Stop Blaming Russia” for
   the hack. “I have some news for Hillary and Democrats—I think I’ve got
   the real culprit,” he wrote. “It doesn’t seem to be the Russians that
   hacked the DNC, but instead a hacker who goes by the name of Guccifer
   2.0.”

   Five months later, in January 2017, the CIA, NSA, and FBI assessed
   “with high confidence” that “Russian military intelligence (General
   Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0
   persona and DCLeaks.com to release US victim data.” But the assessment
   did not directly call Guccifer a Russian intelligence officer. Nor did
   it provide any evidence for its assertions.

   It turns out there is a powerful reason to connect Guccifer to the GRU.

   Guccifer 2.0 sprang into existence on June 15, 2016, hours after a
   report by a computer security firm forensically tied Russia to an
   intrusion at the Democratic National Committee. In a series of blog
   posts and tweets over the following seven months—conspicuously ending
   right as Trump took office and not resuming—the Guccifer persona
   published a smattering of the DNC documents while gamely projecting an
   image as an independent Romanian hacktivist who’d breached the DNC on a
   lark. As Stone’s Breitbart piece demonstrated, Guccifer provided Moscow
   with a counter-narrative for the election interference.

   Guccifer famously pretended to be a “lone hacker” who perpetrated the
   digital DNC break-in. From the outset, few believed it. Motherboard
   conducted a devastating interview with Guccifer that exploded the
   account’s claims of being a native Romanian speaker. Based on forensic
   clues in some of Guccifer’s leaks, and other evidence, a consensus
   quickly formed among security experts that Guccifer was completely
   notional.

   “Almost immediately various cyber security companies and individuals
   were skeptical of Guccifer 2.0 and the backstory that he had generated
   for himself,” said Kyle Ehmke, an intelligence researcher at the cyber
   security firm ThreatConnect. “We started seeing these inconsistencies
   that led back to the idea that he was created hastily… by the
   individual or individuals that affected the DNC compromise.”

   Proving that link definitively was harder. Ehmke worked on an
   investigation at ThreatConnect that tried to track down Guccifer from
   the metadata in his emails. But the trail always ended at the same data
   center in France. Ehmke eventually uncovered that Guccifer was
   connecting through an anonymizing service called Elite VPN, a virtual
   private networking service that had an exit point in France but was
   headquartered in Russia.
   “Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0
   as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on
   Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow.”

   But on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to
   activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real,
   Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an
   American social media company, according to a source familiar with the
   government’s Guccifer investigation. Twitter and WordPress were
   Guccifer 2.0’s favored outlets. Neither company would comment for this
   story, and Guccifer did not respond to a direct message on Twitter.

   Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0
   as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on
   Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. (The Daily Beast’s sources did not
   disclose which particular officer worked as Guccifer.)

   Security firms and declassified U.S. intelligence findings previously
   identified the GRU as the agency running “Fancy Bear,” the 10-year-old
   hacking organization behind the DNC email theft, as well as breaches at
   NATO, Obama’s White House, a French television station, the World
   Anti-Doping Agency, and countless NGOs, and military and civilian
   agencies in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.

   Timestamps in Guccifer 2.0’s first leaks show they were packaged for
   release over the course of a single day in June 2016, beginning just
   hours after the DNC intrusion and its attribution to Russia were made
   public. The moniker was an homage to Romanian hacker Marcel Lazăr
   Lehel, who as “Guccifer” achieved notoriety in 2013 for a string of
   hacks against celebrities and politicians.

   In his inaugural blog post, Guccifer 2.0 disputed Russia’s involvement
   and claimed credit personally for the DNC breach, positioning himself
   as a one-man hacking operation working to expose “the Illuminati.” The
   post included the world’s first glimpse of the enormous cache of
   documents siphoned from the DNC’s network, including the Democrats’
   opposition research report on Trump. Presaging the leaks that would
   roil the election, Guccifer 2.0 declared that he’d already sent the
   bulk of the stolen material to WikiLeaks—which has spent the time since
   obfuscating whether Guccifer was its source.

   On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing its cache of approximately
   19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments stolen in the hack. While Trump
   promoted the leak on Twitter and in rallies, his surrogate Roger Stone
   pushed back against the Kremlin attribution. In his August 2016 article
   for Breitbart, he argued that Guccifer 2.0 was the Romanian hacktivist
   he claimed to be. “Guccifer 2.0 is the real deal,” he wrote.

   Last May, Stone admitted that he’d also exchanged direct messages with
   the Guccifer 2.0 persona, and he released what he claimed was a
   complete transcript of his communications with the account. The
   transcript is brief and banal, showing Stone congratulating Guccifer
   2.0 on returning to Twitter after a brief suspension, and then mostly
   ignoring him. Then and since, Stone has consistently denied that
   Guccifer was connected to the Kremlin.

   “I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State,
   Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as
   intermediaries for them,” he wrote.
   “I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State,
   Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as
   intermediaries for them.”
   — Roger Stone

   Guccifer 2.0 maintained a sporadic online presence throughout the
   election, posting to his dedicated WordPress blog and on Twitter, and
   spilling more DNC documents, sometimes in private emails to
   journalists.

   While the national election clearly interested him (“Democrats prepare
   new provocation against Trump,” he thundered in October 2016), Guccifer
   2.0 reached down the ballot as well, posting documents from the
   Democrats’ national campaign committee on his WordPress blog. There,
   readers could find internal Democratic candidate assessments relevant
   to battleground states like Pennsylvania and Florida; internal
   assessments of key congressional districts, with granular analyses of
   their demographics; and campaign recruitment material.

   The GRU officer was eager to share this trove, as well. A GOP political
   operative in Florida, Aaron Nevins, DM’d Guccifer 2.0 a request for
   “any Florida based information” and received 2.5 gigabytes’ worth,
   according to The Wall Street Journal. The data, he enthused to Guccifer
   2.0, was “probably worth millions of dollars.” A consultant for a
   successful Florida Republican congressional candidate told the paper,
   “I did adjust some voting targets based on some data I saw from the
   leaks.”

   Sometime after its hasty launch, the Guccifer persona was handed off to
   a more experienced GRU officer, according to a source familiar with the
   matter. The timing of that handoff is unclear, but Guccifer 2.0’s last
   blog post, from Jan. 12, 2017, evinced a far greater command of English
   than the persona’s earlier efforts.

   “It’s obvious that the intelligence agencies are deliberately
   falsifying evidence,” the post read. “In my opinion, they’re playing
   into the hands of the Democrats who are trying to blame foreign actors
   for their failure.”

   (Contrast that with the language from a June 2016 post: “I made some
   conclusions from the Marcel’s story and decided not to put all eggs in
   one basket. Moreover, other cases weren’t so successful and didn’t
   bring me the glory.”)

   Today the most popular counter-narrative surrounding Guccifer 2.0
   concedes that the account was a fake persona but posits that it was
   created by the DNC to support a false-flag operation implicating
   Russia. In this theory, advanced in two widely cited anonymous blogs,
   Guccifer 2.0 was the DNC posing as Russia posing as a Romanian hacker.

EYES ON THE PRIZE

The Russia Probe Went After the Wrong People

   As lawmakers here kept turning inward, they lost focus on the real
   Russian danger.

   After Russia interfered in our election, Washington blew it by turning
   inward—to Trump and the collusion question—instead of outward. The
   resulting political turmoil was a gift to Vladimir Putin. From the
   Kremlin’s perspective, the Mueller Report was an after-action report
   showing the election-interference op was more successful then he had
   hoped.

   American lawmakers are running out of time to repair and strengthen our
   defenses ahead of the 2020 election—a threat I saw firsthand while
   leading the investigation into the breach of the Democratic National
   Committee by Russian foreign intelligence services in 2016.

   Yet when Robert Mueller delivers his long-awaited testimony this week,
   I don’t anticipate the questions will focus on Russia and the vicious
   attack on our electoral process in 2016 so much as they will on
   America’s internal strife.

   Donald Trump obstructing justice, Paul Manafort evading taxes, or Roger
   Stone lying to Congress did not contribute to one of Russia’s greatest
   military victories since World War II. A myopic focus on domestic
   criminal activity during Mueller’s testimony this week will only leave
   America more vulnerable to future attacks from Russia and other
   countries.

   Volume I of the special counsel’s investigation into election
   interference focused on criminal acts committed by the Internet
   Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence agency,
   GRU, resulting in two federal indictments naming 25 Russian citizens
   and three corporate entities as defendants. Those appear impactful and,
   in fact, the thrust of U.S. deterrence against state-sponsored
   cyberattacks since 2014 has been the use of federal indictments to
   officially attribute them to state sponsors, also including China and
   Iran.

   But federal indictments have proved to be an imperfect tool for
   deterrence. Metaphorically, they are a theatrical performance designed
   to captivate the media and provide an illusion of decisive action.

   The first issue with the indictments of Russian operators is that there
   is no method of enforcement. Without the ability to compel extradition
   of those individuals, the United States is unable to enforce any action
   unilaterally. Under these conditions, they are a paper tiger.

   Second, the indictments are micro in their effect. For example, one of
   the GRU defendants is 2nd Lt. Artem Andreyevich Malyshev, born in 1988,
   making him only 28 years old during the 2016 presidential election.
   While I am sure the U.S. indictment has changed the lives of those
   officers forever, the remote prospect of a trial for Malyshev does
   little to deter the Russian Federation from committing election
   interference in the future. The officers named in the indictment are
   expendable.

   Along with the indictments have come some sanctions, covering more than
   100 Russian oligarchs, government officials, and other citizens along
   with 12 corporate entities for their roles interfering in our
   elections. Despite the bite of these sanctions, the attacks continue.
   In early 2019, the same unit that launched an attack on the 2016
   elections conducted a massive cyberattack against U.S.-based think
   tanks and nonprofits.

   History instructs us that to create a successful deterrent model
   against Russia you must establish consequence. President Kennedy
   initiated the blockade of Cuba to deter the Soviets from delivering
   ballistic missiles. President Truman authorized the Berlin airlift,
   putting an end to Soviet aggression in Germany. And President Reagan
   invaded Grenada, eliminating global fear of the Soviet Brezhnev
   Doctrine. While there are many soft- and hard-power levers that meet
   our current needs, any action should focus on two principles:
   marginalizing Russian expansion and escalating negative pressure on the
   Russian sphere of influence.

   To marginalize Russian expansion, the U.S. could use its influence in
   the Gulf states to drive down the price of oil and shift European oil
   and gas imports from Russia to NATO countries, creating an immediate
   loss of value within the Russian economy. Or the U.S. can increase
   foreign military sales to countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia,
   putting increased pressure on Russian allies like Iran and Syria.
   Finally, the U.S. should strongly consider significant weapons and
   troop deployments to Russia’s geographic borders.

   As tensions between our two countries increase, U.S. policymakers can’t
   afford to keep revisiting 2016 to the detriment of establishing the
   conditions needed for a safe and secure election in 2020. There’s
   little sign so far that we’ve learned our lesson.

Angry Virgin Threatened to Kill ‘as Many Girls as I See’ Near Women’s March

   Christopher Cleary was arrested for writing he wanted to be the ‘next
   mass shooter’ and kill women who ‘turned me down.’ Cops worried he was
   targeting an anti-Trump demonstration.

   A Colorado man who raged online about his virginity threatened to kill
   “as many girls as I see,” leading police to fear he was targeting a
   nearby Women’s March event.

   Christopher Cleary, 27, was arrested Saturday after writing a long
   Facebook diatribe about being a virgin and wanting to become “the next
   mass shooter.” Cleary told police he was just venting, but he was
   already on probation from a 2018 conviction for stalking and making a
   repeated communication of domestic violence. And a series of murderous
   young men who call themselves “incels” (“involuntarily celibate”) have
   recently used singledom as an excuse for deadly attacks on women.

   Cleary traveled to Provo, Utah and checked into an AirBnB on January
   18, the day before the city’s planned Women’s March, according to
   Denver’s ABC7. Late that night, his Facebook friends started calling
   police to report a series of threatening posts he allegedly authored.

   “All I wanted was a girlfriend, not 1000… not a bunch of hoes,” Cleary
   allegedly wrote. “I’ve never had a girlfriend before and I’m still a
   virgin, this is why I’m planning on shooting up a public place soon and
   being the next mass shooter cause I’m ready to die and all the girls
   the turned me down is going to make it right by killing as many girls
   as I see.” He allegedly added that “there’s nothing more dangerous than
   man ready to die.”

   Police traced his phone and arrested him the morning of the march at a
   Provo McDonald’s. Cleary told police that he had an impulse disorder,
   and that he had been upset when he authored the posts, according to
   police.

   But it wasn’t his first or even second scrape with the law. At the time
   of his Saturday arrest, he was less than a year into a three-year
   probation for felony stalking, according to court records reviewed by
   The Daily Beast. He pleaded guilty to a similar felony stalking charge
   in 2016. In a case stemming from a 2015 arrest, he was charged with
   posting a private image for harassment, posting a private image for
   monetary gain, harassment by striking or kicking a person, and
   harassment by repeated phone calls. He pleaded guilty to the final
   charge, and the former were dismissed.

   He pleaded guilty to making threats and causing “disturbances via
   phone” in 2013, and assault in 2009.

   Had he carried out an attack, Cleary would have been the latest in a
   series of men to murder women for refusing to date him. In 2014,
   22-year-old Elliot Rodger opened fire on students at the University of
   California, Santa Barbara. Rodger was highly active in a misogynistic
   internet community of young men who felt jilted by women. In YouTube
   videos and manifestos, Rodger described murdering women as
   “retribution” for their lack of interest in him. He murdered six people
   and injured another 14 before shooting himself to death.

   Since the massacre, men who share Rodgers’ hatred of women and sense of
   rejection have coalesced into a more-defined internet movement. The
   group call themselves “incels” and  promotes violent misogyny. Cleary
   wrote in language similar to that of incel forums, although his
   belonging to the group is subject to debate.

   The term “incel” originated with a liberal blogger, who wrote about
   normalizing virginity, particularly for people who were isolated from
   the dating world for reasons of disability or sexual orientation.
   Cleary fit those broad terms of a person who wished to have sex, but
   remained a virgin. But the modern incel culture has morphed into a more
   explicit ideology of male supremacy, which does not apply to every
   adult virgin. It’s an opt-in culture, one that shares Cleary’s apparent
   rage at virginity, although he is not reported to have shared content
   from incel sites.

   Try as they may to blame their woes on women, forum-goers brutally
   criticize each others’ appearances, convincing each other that they’ll
   never find a date, Vice reported last year. In a survey of 300 users on
   a major incel forum, more than half of respondents said they’d
   considered plastic surgery. Loneliness (only 36.7 percent of

   It is now legal for law enforcement in North Dakota to fly drones armed
   with everything from Tasers to tear gas thanks to a last-minute push by
   a pro-police lobbyist.

   With all the concern over the militarization of police in the past
   year, no one noticed that the state became the first in the union to
   allow police to equip drones with “less than lethal” weapons. House
   Bill 1328 wasn’t drafted that way, but then a lobbyist representing law
   enforcement—tight with a booming drone industry—got his hands on it.

   The bill’s stated intent was to require police to obtain a search
   warrant from a judge in order to use a drone to search for criminal
   evidence. In fact, the original draft of Representative Rick Becker’s
   bill would have banned all weapons on police drones.

   Then Bruce Burkett of the North Dakota Peace Officer’s Association was
   allowed by the state house committee to amend HB 1328 and limit the
   prohibition only to lethal weapons. “Less than lethal” weapons like
   rubber bullets, pepper spray, tear gas, sound cannons, and Tasers are
   therefore permitted on police drones.

   Becker, the bill’s Republican sponsor, said he had to live with it.

   “This is one I’m not in full agreement with. I wish it was any weapon,”
   he said at a hearing in March. “In my opinion there should be a nice,
   red line: Drones should not be weaponized. Period.”

   Even “less than lethal” weapons can kill though. At least 39 people
   have been killed by police Tasers in 2015 so far, according to The
   Guardian. Bean bags, rubber bullets, and flying tear gas canisters have
   also maimed, if not killed, in the U.S. and abroad.

   Becker said he worried about police firing on criminal suspects
   remotely, not unlike U.S. Air Force pilots who bomb the so-called
   Islamic State, widely known as ISIS, from more than 5,000 miles away.

   “When you’re not on the ground, and you’re making decisions, you’re
   sort of separate,” Becker said in March. “Depersonalized.”

   Drones have been in use for decades by the military, but their high
   prices have prevented police departments from obtaining them until
   recently. Money’s no problem for the the Grand Forks County Sheriff’s
   Department, though: A California manufacturer loaned them two drones.

   Grand Forks County Sheriff Bob Rost said his department’s drones are
   only equipped with cameras and he doesn’t think he should need a
   warrant to go snooping.

   “It was a bad bill to start with,” Rost told The Daily Beast. “We just
   thought the whole thing was ridiculous.”

   Rost said he needs to use drones for surveillance in order to obtain a
   warrant in the first place.

   “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear,” Becker
   remembered opponents like Rost saying.

   Yet the sheriff’s department is hiding a full accounting of how many
   drone missions they’ve flown since 2012. Records requests by The Daily
   Beast were initially denied by the sheriff because they would “cost a
   fortune,” and were only handed over after an appeal to the state’s
   attorney general’s office.

   The sheriff and lobbyists assured lawmakers that drones would only be
   used in non-criminal situations, like the search for a missing person
   or to photograph an accident scene. What they didn’t mention was the
   2011 arrest of Rodney Brossart, a cattle thief who was caught by a
   Department of Homeland Security drone.

   When a few cows wandered onto his land, Brossart refused to take them
   back to their owner, his neighbor. The neighbor called the police and
   the situation turned into a 16-hour standoff. Fearful of entering his
   ranch without knowing where Brossart was, police asked Homeland
   Security to redirect a Predator searching the border with Canada.

   The drone meant to find drug smugglers instead found Brossart—on his
   own property—and he was arrested.

   Law enforcement wasn’t the only one who disapproved of the legislation.
   A representative from the North Dakota Department of Commerce, the vice
   president of an economic development group, the founder of a drone
   company, and the director of the University of North Dakota’s drone
   major program all testified against the bill.

   Why would a bunch of business types want to stop something like
   warrants for drones?

   “I think when you’re trying to stimulate an industry in your state, you
   don’t want things that would potentially have a chilling effect on
   [drone] manufacturers,” said Al Frazier, a Grand Forks sheriff’s deputy
   who pilots the drones.

   Organizations like the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems
   International track legislation, especially any laws that appear to
   limit drone “development,” according to Keith Lund of the Grand Forks
   Regional Economic Development Corporation.

   “Requiring a search warrant for surveillance is ‘restricting
   development’?” asked Rep. Gary Paur, a Republican, at a hearing.

   “It’s really all about the commercial development, which is where all
   of this is heading,” Lund replied. “If [a law] is somehow limiting
   commercial, law enforcement development... that is a negative in terms
   of companies looking and investing in opportunities in the state of
   North Dakota,” Lund said.

   In other words, limit civil liberties so Big Drone can spread its
   wings.

   Drones in North Dakota are a profitable enterprise in a state hit hard
   by the oil bust. Companies that market machines for agricultural and
   commercial use have been popping up in industrial parks on the
   outskirts of Grand Forks for the better part of the last three years.
   The university, one of the city’s largest employers, even offers a
   four-year degree in drones. The Air Force has partnered with the
   private sector to create a drone research and development park, too.

   In January, on a ribbon of video screen that wraps its way around UND’s
   Ralph Engelstad Arena, the bubble nose of an RQ-4 Global Hawk, the
   Predator drone, glided silently past the backdrop of a clear blue sky.
   That image—an advertisement for Northrop Grumman—appeared during the
   second intermission of a sold-out hockey game.

   “This is the first year they’ve advertised here,” a friend said to me.

   ***

   Perhaps Brossart’s arrest was included in the 401 drone operations the
   FAA says were undertaken by the Grand Forks County Sheriff’s Department
   in the past three years. But that number doesn’t square with the 21
   missions flown by the agency in the same time period, all detailed in
   documents obtained by The Daily Beast through open-records requests.

   In addition to the flawed comparison to helicopters and the milquetoast
   descriptions of drone use, police continually cited Federal Aviation
   Administration rules that require law enforcement organizations
   authorized to operate drones to notify the FAA when the devices are
   deployed as a reason why HB 1328 was unnecessary.

   This also appears to be an incomplete analysis.

   According to documents obtained by MuckRock, the FAA notes 401 drone
   “operations” performed by the Grand Forks County Sheriff’s Department
   from 2012 to September 2014, while Rost and Frazier maintain just 21
   missions have taken place. Those 401 operations noted by the FAA have
   resulted in 80.5 hours of flights, a number that can’t be independently
   verified because a lawyer representing the sheriff’s department did not
   include duration of flights for the 21 missions detailed in response to
   an open-records request from The Daily Beast. (HB 1328 requires police
   to retain data, including flight duration, for five years after it is
   collected.)

   Rost and Frazier did not reply to multiple requests for comment
   regarding the discrepancy between the FAA’s numbers and their own, and
   the FAA hasn’t provided an explanation for how it defines “operations.”

   Similar to those who have supported the NSA’s massive data collection
   program, Rost and others repeatedly fell back to an argument that was
   cited untold times over the last two years as Becker fought for his
   bill.

   “We don’t make a practice of snooping on people,” Rost said recently.

   However, Rost’s statement was followed by an admission that the sheriff
   expects drones to be used in criminal investigations in the near
   future.

   Rost argued against the bill on the basis that police would in good
   faith obtain warrants if they decided to use drones for surveillance,
   and that judges be allowed to “do their job.”

   “I understand that judges regulate whether you would have to get a
   warrant, but there’s nothing currently in the law setting perimeters
   for UAS [unmanned aircraft systems],” a North Dakota lawmaker told Rost
   at a February hearing. “What’s wrong with having something in law?”

   Verbally diminishing the power of drones and what they would be used
   for in the bill’s hearings was the second of a two-part strategy from
   law enforcement. The first was a public relations push that included
   months’ worth of op-eds in the state’s two largest newspapers, the
   Grand Forks Herald and the Fargo Forum. Usually penned by Frazier, the
   UND aviation professor who also pilots two of the drones used by the
   Grand Forks County Sheriff’s Department, the public face of police
   drones has at times been different from comments made outside the
   media.

   “To read Rep. Becker’s bill, you would think that these would be highly
   effective surveillance tools that could be put up over locations for
   persistent surveillances and violate people’s constitutional rights,”
   Frazier told the Herald in January. “And the reality is none of that is
   correct."

   Compare that to Frazier’s remarks at a 2011 UAS conference attended by
   many members of law enforcement. Sarah Nelson, a journalist and
   Bismarck native who has studied police use of drones, was also there.
   She testified in a March hearing on HB 1328, and told the committee
   about Frazier’s comments at the 2011 conference, which stand in stark
   contrast to his printed words.

   “[Frazier] spoke openly about the potential use of unmanned systems in
   North Dakota,” at the conference, Nelson said. “The list included the
   deployment of a hovering drone that was ‘Not audible or visible to
   people below in order to collect real time intelligence video.’”

   Grand Forks is probably the only place in the country where you’ll find
   advertisements for Predator drones, the operators of which are trained
   and stationed at the nearby Air Force base. There, past the airport a
   few miles outside the western edge of the city, the landscape gives way
   to the prairie that covers the vast middle of North Dakota. But before
   civilization is left behind on a westward route, the city, its
   politicians, the base, and the powerful interests of the drone program
   at the University of North Dakota are adding a futuristic appendage:
   Grand Sky.

   Billed as a UAS research and development facility, Grand Sky will
   combine all the benefits of private entrepreneurship and government
   capital. Tenants there will have access to some of the the Air Force
   base’s facilities, and drone companies are clamoring to get their
   spots. On its website, Grand Sky is billed as an opportunity to “Create
   History Where the Future is Wide Open.”

   It is certainly that: The residents of Grand Forks, like those
   throughout the state who have taken a laissez-faire attitude to oil
   companies reaping millions from North Dakota ground, appear concerned
   primarily with the economic benefits of drone technology. Becker, the
   Republican state legislator who sponsored HB 1328, said heartburn over
   individual privacy, constitutional rights, and, on a larger scale, the
   ethics of killing people a half a world away by wielding a joystick,
   doesn’t seem to exist for many in the state.

   Part of the reason for this, Frazier argued, is a compliance committee
   keeps police use of drones in check. A body with no legal authority,
   the committee tracks and reviews how police use their drones and
   discusses possible privacy concerns. Frazier and others in law
   enforcement—as well as representatives from the private sector and
   those from UND—cited the committee watchdog role as yet another reason
   why HB 1328 was unnecessary.

   But the group isn’t exactly comprised of a diverse cross section of
   political thought. Of the committee’s 18 members, six are from UND,
   which has a vested interest in promoting drone use. Three are members
   of local government, including the city planner and an assistant
   state’s attorney. And the rest are either current or former members of
   law enforcement and emergency services.

   Frazier said that the sheriff’s department had nothing to do with the
   makeup of the group, which was created by charter. The committee is not
   a “rubber stamp,” he added. And besides, there simply hasn’t been much
   public outcry over police use of drones, or really any interest in
   tracking how police use them.

   Drones are overwhelmingly seen as a good thing in North Dakota, which
   is perhaps why few noticed when HB 1328 passed with a clause allowing
   them to be armed with non-lethal weapons.

   ***

   “I agree completely with the idea that there should be public oversight
   of a public asset, but to a great degree disagree with the idea that
   the public is overly concerned with it,” Frazier said. “I think the
   media is making a big deal out of something that isn’t a big deal.”

   It may be that the sheriff’s use of drones is completely innocuous,
   that there is some kind of technical verbiage-related mixup that would
   explain the discrepancy between the FAA’s numbers and those provided by
   Frazier and Rost. It also may be that the pair had nothing to do with
   the non-lethal exception included in HB 1328, which they say is the
   case. Both said they pulled out of any negotiations over the bill’s
   language, thinking it was “doomed,” Rost said.

   It wasn’t, thanks to Becker, who succeeded in creating a check against
   law enforcement with the warrant requirement, but failed to prevent
   police from arming drones that are increasingly filling North Dakota
   skies.

   In attempting to convince legislators to pass HB 1328, Nelson, the
   journalist and Bismarck native, said it wasn’t distrust of police that
   prompted the bill to be crafted, but a democratic duty to maintain
   trust in government.

   “When grappling with how to regulate powerful technologies, it’s a
   common practice of both law enforcement and the larger intelligence
   community to say that technologies are being used on very bad people in
   very extreme cases. This is an effective strategy because the public
   sees themselves as vastly different from those bad people,” she said in
   March. “In response to this argument, I would urge the committee to
   remember that liberty is eroded at the fringes.”

The Truth About Trump’s Insane Ukraine ‘Server’ Conspiracy

   Trump asked Ukraine’s president to help prove a bonkers,
   Russia-friendly conspiracy theory that U.S. intel relied on
   manufactured evidence to blame the 2016 DNC hack on Moscow.

Kevin Poulsen9.25.19 4:38 PM ET

   Donald Trump asked for more than a criminal investigation of his
   political opponent’s son in his call with Ukraine’s president. Trump
   also sought help in reviving a long-ago debunked conspiracy theory that
   challenges the basic underpinnings of the U.S. intelligence community’s
   findings on Russia’s 2016 election interference, in a bizarre spectacle
   that sees an American president trying to conscript a foreign leader
   into undermining his own intelligence agencies.

   “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation
   with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike,” Trump said, according to a
   compilation of notes on the call released by he White House. “I guess
   you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has
   it.”

   To those not versed in fringe-right canon it’s a curious thing to say.
   “It almost sounds like he was babbling to the president of Ukraine,”
   said Robert Johnston, CEO of Adlumin, who led the DNC breach
   investigation while at Crowdstrike. “I imagine it would have confused
   the Ukranian president. Like, ‘What are you talking about?’”

   Conservative websites are spinning the odd exchange as a reference to a
   Justice Department investigation ordered by William Barr into the
   origins of the Mueller probe. “It is unclear specifically what Trump
   was referring to with Crowdstrike,” reads one article in this vein on
   The Federalist. In truth, it’s actually quite clear. Trump is
   referencing a conspiracy theory pushed by Russian trolls and far-right
   pundits that imagines the Democratic National Committee fabricating all
   the evidence in Russia’s 2016 breach of the DNC network.
   “Trump has shown a pronounced preference for the pretend version of
   events.”

   The hoax has its roots in a GRU persona, “Guccifer 2.0,” created to
   cast doubt on Russia’s culpability in the DNC hack. Today it’s
   buttressed by deceptive blog posts, memes and putative forensic
   analysis of metadata in documents leaked from the DNC and John Podesta
   intrusions, and has spun out several related theories and offshoots,
   including the Seth Rich hoax that blames the hack on a slain DNC
   staffer with previously-unknown hacking skills.

   Crowdstrike enters the picture because it’s the security firm the DNC
   hired to investigate the breach back in 2016, and the first of many to
   identify Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, as the
   perpetrator. A publicly-traded company headquartered in California,
   Crowdstrike has nothing to do with Ukraine, except in conspiracyland,
   which pretends that Crowdstrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is
   Ukranian, and that he framed Russia for election interference both on
   the DNC’s orders and to punish Putin for invading his homeland.

   In real life, Alperovitch is American citizen born in Russia who
   escaped to the U.S. with his family during the Soviet era. But Trump
   has shown a pronounced preference for the pretend version.

   “Why wouldn’t Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the
   server?” Trump asked the AP in 2017. “They brought in another company
   that I hear is Ukrainian-based … I heard it’s owned by a very rich
   Ukrainian, that’s what I heard.”

   The “server” in the conspiracy is the hacked DNC server that the
   democrats, the claim goes won’t let the FBI examine, because it would
   expose their elaborate plot. “What is the server saying?” Trump asked
   in one tweet last year.

   That part’s made up, too. The DNC turned down one unusual FBI request
   early in the hack investigation. The bureau wanted access to the DNC’s
   network while the Russians were still in it, most likely to stage a
   counter operation against the GRU. The DNC declined, perhaps reluctant
   to have two intelligence agencies playing capture-the-flag in their
   systems five months before a presidential election. The DNC later
   authorized Crowdstrike to share full copies of the hacked servers with
   the bureau, giving the FBI access to the same evidence Crowdstrike
   had.

   “With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided
   all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI,” Crowdstrike said in a
   statement Wednesday. “As we’ve stated before, we stand by our findings
   and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence
   community.”

   In truth, Crowdstrike’s findings were never controversial among
   security experts, and they were later confirmed by FBI agents with
   access to the same evidence, as well as additional evidence Crowdstrike
   never had. In October 2018, Robert Mueller indicted 12 GRU officers for
   the DNC intrusion and hacks targeting John Podesta and the DCCC.

   Today the secret server hoax is mostly confined to the very edge of the
   conservative fringe, though it’s made an appearance in court. Indicted
   former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone has been using the theory to
   try and get evidence against him thrown out of court, even filing an
   affidavit written by William Binney, one of the conspiracy theory’s
   most dogged advocates.  Last week the federal judge overseeing Stone’s
   obstruction of justice case rejected his motion without ruling on the
   conspiracy theory itself.

   Update, 7/13/2018: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office identified
   Guccifer 2.0 as a Russian intelligence officer and indicted him along
   with 11 other officers for crimes related to the alleged hacking of
   Democrats in 2016.

   Guccifer 2.0, the “lone hacker” who took credit for providing WikiLeaks
   with stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, was in fact
   an officer of Russia’s military intelligence directorate (GRU), The
   Daily Beast has learned. It’s an attribution that resulted from a
   fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft.

   That forensic determination has substantial implications for the
   criminal probe into potential collusion between President Donald Trump
   and Russia. The Daily Beast has learned that the special counsel in
   that investigation, Robert Mueller, has taken over the probe into
   Guccifer and brought the FBI agents who worked to track the persona
   onto his team.

   While it’s unclear what Mueller plans to do with Guccifer, his last
   round of indictments charged 13 Russians tied to the Internet Research
   Agency troll farm with a conspiracy “for the purpose of interfering
   with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the
   presidential election of 2016.” It was Mueller’s first move
   establishing Russian interference in the election within a criminal
   context, but it stopped short of directly implicating the Putin regime.

   Mueller’s office declined to comment for this story. But the
   attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest foreign
   intelligence agency would cross the Kremlin threshold—and move the
   investigation closer to Trump himself.
   “The attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest
   foreign intelligence agency brings the investigation closer to the
   Kremlin’s doorstep—and to Trump himself.”

   Trump’s longtime political adviser Roger Stone admitted being in touch
   with Guccifer over Twitter’s direct messaging service. And in August
   2016, Stone published an article on the pro-Trump-friendly Breitbart
   News calling on his political opponents to “Stop Blaming Russia” for
   the hack. “I have some news for Hillary and Democrats—I think I’ve got
   the real culprit,” he wrote. “It doesn’t seem to be the Russians that
   hacked the DNC, but instead a hacker who goes by the name of Guccifer
   2.0.”

   Five months later, in January 2017, the CIA, NSA, and FBI assessed
   “with high confidence” that “Russian military intelligence (General
   Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0
   persona and DCLeaks.com to release US victim data.” But the assessment
   did not directly call Guccifer a Russian intelligence officer. Nor did
   it provide any evidence for its assertions.

   It turns out there is a powerful reason to connect Guccifer to the GRU.

   Guccifer 2.0 sprang into existence on June 15, 2016, hours after a
   report by a computer security firm forensically tied Russia to an
   intrusion at the Democratic National Committee. In a series of blog
   posts and tweets over the following seven months—conspicuously ending
   right as Trump took office and not resuming—the Guccifer persona
   published a smattering of the DNC documents while gamely projecting an
   image as an independent Romanian hacktivist who’d breached the DNC on a
   lark. As Stone’s Breitbart piece demonstrated, Guccifer provided Moscow
   with a counter-narrative for the election interference.

   Guccifer famously pretended to be a “lone hacker” who perpetrated the
   digital DNC break-in. From the outset, few believed it. Motherboard
   conducted a devastating interview with Guccifer that exploded the
   account’s claims of being a native Romanian speaker. Based on forensic
   clues in some of Guccifer’s leaks, and other evidence, a consensus
   quickly formed among security experts that Guccifer was completely
   notional.

   “Almost immediately various cyber security companies and individuals
   were skeptical of Guccifer 2.0 and the backstory that he had generated
   for himself,” said Kyle Ehmke, an intelligence researcher at the cyber
   security firm ThreatConnect. “We started seeing these inconsistencies
   that led back to the idea that he was created hastily… by the
   individual or individuals that affected the DNC compromise.”

   Proving that link definitively was harder. Ehmke worked on an
   investigation at ThreatConnect that tried to track down Guccifer from
   the metadata in his emails. But the trail always ended at the same data
   center in France. Ehmke eventually uncovered that Guccifer was
   connecting through an anonymizing service called Elite VPN, a virtual
   private networking service that had an exit point in France but was
   headquartered in Russia.
   “Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0
   as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on
   Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow.”

   But on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to
   activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real,
   Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an
   American social media company, according to a source familiar with the
   government’s Guccifer investigation. Twitter and WordPress were
   Guccifer 2.0’s favored outlets. Neither company would comment for this
   story, and Guccifer did not respond to a direct message on Twitter.

   Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0
   as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on
   Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. (The Daily Beast’s sources did not
   disclose which particular officer worked as Guccifer.)

   Security firms and declassified U.S. intelligence findings previously
   identified the GRU as the agency running “Fancy Bear,” the 10-year-old
   hacking organization behind the DNC email theft, as well as breaches at
   NATO, Obama’s White House, a French television station, the World
   Anti-Doping Agency, and countless NGOs, and military and civilian
   agencies in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.

   Timestamps in Guccifer 2.0’s first leaks show they were packaged for
   release over the course of a single day in June 2016, beginning just
   hours after the DNC intrusion and its attribution to Russia were made
   public. The moniker was an homage to Romanian hacker Marcel Lazăr
   Lehel, who as “Guccifer” achieved notoriety in 2013 for a string of
   hacks against celebrities and politicians.

   In his inaugural blog post, Guccifer 2.0 disputed Russia’s involvement
   and claimed credit personally for the DNC breach, positioning himself
   as a one-man hacking operation working to expose “the Illuminati.” The
   post included the world’s first glimpse of the enormous cache of
   documents siphoned from the DNC’s network, including the Democrats’
   opposition research report on Trump. Presaging the leaks that would
   roil the election, Guccifer 2.0 declared that he’d already sent the
   bulk of the stolen material to WikiLeaks—which has spent the time since
   obfuscating whether Guccifer was its source.

   On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing its cache of approximately
   19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments stolen in the hack. While Trump
   promoted the leak on Twitter and in rallies, his surrogate Roger Stone
   pushed back against the Kremlin attribution. In his August 2016 article
   for Breitbart, he argued that Guccifer 2.0 was the Romanian hacktivist
   he claimed to be. “Guccifer 2.0 is the real deal,” he wrote.

   Last May, Stone admitted that he’d also exchanged direct messages with
   the Guccifer 2.0 persona, and he released what he claimed was a
   complete transcript of his communications with the account. The
   transcript is brief and banal, showing Stone congratulating Guccifer
   2.0 on returning to Twitter after a brief suspension, and then mostly
   ignoring him. Then and since, Stone has consistently denied that
   Guccifer was connected to the Kremlin.

   “I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State,
   Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as
   intermediaries for them,” he wrote.
   “I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State,
   Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as
   intermediaries for them.”
   — Roger Stone

   Guccifer 2.0 maintained a sporadic online presence throughout the
   election, posting to his dedicated WordPress blog and on Twitter, and
   spilling more DNC documents, sometimes in private emails to
   journalists.

   While the national election clearly interested him (“Democrats prepare
   new provocation against Trump,” he thundered in October 2016), Guccifer
   2.0 reached down the ballot as well, posting documents from the
   Democrats’ national campaign committee on his WordPress blog. There,
   readers could find internal Democratic candidate assessments relevant
   to battleground states like Pennsylvania and Florida; internal
   assessments of key congressional districts, with granular analyses of
   their demographics; and campaign recruitment material.

   The GRU officer was eager to share this trove, as well. A GOP political
   operative in Florida, Aaron Nevins, DM’d Guccifer 2.0 a request for
   “any Florida based information” and received 2.5 gigabytes’ worth,
   according to The Wall Street Journal. The data, he enthused to Guccifer
   2.0, was “probably worth millions of dollars.” A consultant for a
   successful Florida Republican congressional candidate told the paper,
   “I did adjust some voting targets based on some data I saw from the
   leaks.”

   Sometime after its hasty launch, the Guccifer persona was handed off to
   a more experienced GRU officer, according to a source familiar with the
   matter. The timing of that handoff is unclear, but Guccifer 2.0’s last
   blog post, from Jan. 12, 2017, evinced a far greater command of English
   than the persona’s earlier efforts.

   “It’s obvious that the intelligence agencies are deliberately
   falsifying evidence,” the post read. “In my opinion, they’re playing
   into the hands of the Democrats who are trying to blame foreign actors
   for their failure.”

   (Contrast that with the language from a June 2016 post: “I made some
   conclusions from the Marcel’s story and decided not to put all eggs in
   one basket. Moreover, other cases weren’t so successful and didn’t
   bring me the glory.”)

   Today the most popular counter-narrative surrounding Guccifer 2.0
   concedes that the account was a fake persona but posits that it was
   created by the DNC to support a false-flag operation implicating
   Russia. In this theory, advanced in two widely cited anonymous blogs,
   Guccifer 2.0 was the DNC posing as Russia posing as a Romanian hacker.

EYES ON THE PRIZE

The Russia Probe Went After the Wrong People

   As lawmakers here kept turning inward, they lost focus on the real
   Russian danger.

   After Russia interfered in our election, Washington blew it by turning
   inward—to Trump and the collusion question—instead of outward. The
   resulting political turmoil was a gift to Vladimir Putin. From the
   Kremlin’s perspective, the Mueller Report was an after-action report
   showing the election-interference op was more successful then he had
   hoped.

   American lawmakers are running out of time to repair and strengthen our
   defenses ahead of the 2020 election—a threat I saw firsthand while
   leading the investigation into the breach of the Democratic National
   Committee by Russian foreign intelligence services in 2016.

   Yet when Robert Mueller delivers his long-awaited testimony this week,
   I don’t anticipate the questions will focus on Russia and the vicious
   attack on our electoral process in 2016 so much as they will on
   America’s internal strife.

   Donald Trump obstructing justice, Paul Manafort evading taxes, or Roger
   Stone lying to Congress did not contribute to one of Russia’s greatest
   military victories since World War II. A myopic focus on domestic
   criminal activity during Mueller’s testimony this week will only leave
   America more vulnerable to future attacks from Russia and other
   countries.

   Volume I of the special counsel’s investigation into election
   interference focused on criminal acts committed by the Internet
   Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence agency,
   GRU, resulting in two federal indictments naming 25 Russian citizens
   and three corporate entities as defendants. Those appear impactful and,
   in fact, the thrust of U.S. deterrence against state-sponsored
   cyberattacks since 2014 has been the use of federal indictments to
   officially attribute them to state sponsors, also including China and
   Iran.

   But federal indictments have proved to be an imperfect tool for
   deterrence. Metaphorically, they are a theatrical performance designed
   to captivate the media and provide an illusion of decisive action.

   The first issue with the indictments of Russian operators is that there
   is no method of enforcement. Without the ability to compel extradition
   of those individuals, the United States is unable to enforce any action
   unilaterally. Under these conditions, they are a paper tiger.

   Second, the indictments are micro in their effect. For example, one of
   the GRU defendants is 2nd Lt. Artem Andreyevich Malyshev, born in 1988,
   making him only 28 years old during the 2016 presidential election.
   While I am sure the U.S. indictment has changed the lives of those
   officers forever, the remote prospect of a trial for Malyshev does
   little to deter the Russian Federation from committing election
   interference in the future. The officers named in the indictment are
   expendable.

   Along with the indictments have come some sanctions, covering more than
   100 Russian oligarchs, government officials, and other citizens along
   with 12 corporate entities for their roles interfering in our
   elections. Despite the bite of these sanctions, the attacks continue.
   In early 2019, the same unit that launched an attack on the 2016
   elections conducted a massive cyberattack against U.S.-based think
   tanks and nonprofits.

   History instructs us that to create a successful deterrent model
   against Russia you must establish consequence. President Kennedy
   initiated the blockade of Cuba to deter the Soviets from delivering
   ballistic missiles. President Truman authorized the Berlin airlift,
   putting an end to Soviet aggression in Germany. And President Reagan
   invaded Grenada, eliminating global fear of the Soviet Brezhnev
   Doctrine. While there are many soft- and hard-power levers that meet
   our current needs, any action should focus on two principles:
   marginalizing Russian expansion and escalating negative pressure on the
   Russian sphere of influence.

   To marginalize Russian expansion, the U.S. could use its influence in
   the Gulf states to drive down the price of oil and shift European oil
   and gas imports from Russia to NATO countries, creating an immediate
   loss of value within the Russian economy. Or the U.S. can increase
   foreign military sales to countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia,
   putting increased pressure on Russian allies like Iran and Syria.
   Finally, the U.S. should strongly consider significant weapons and
   troop deployments to Russia’s geographic borders.

   As tensions between our two countries increase, U.S. policymakers can’t
   afford to keep revisiting 2016 to the detriment of establishing the
   conditions needed for a safe and secure election in 2020. There’s
   little sign so far that we’ve learned our lesson.

WAIT… WHAT?

Trump’s ‘Missing DNC Server’ Is Neither Missing Nor a Server

   The president can spout conspiracy theories all he wants. But the DNC
   turned over all its key data to the FBI after it got hacked. And that
   info wasn’t stored on a single server.

   Donald Trump turns to right-wing conspiracy theories when he’s
   cornered, and he was cornered on Monday. Standing feet away from
   Vladimir Putin at a press conference following their Helsinki
   tete-a-tete, a reporter challenged Trump to condemn Putin for Russia’s
   election interference, “in front of the world.” Instead, the world
   watched as the president of the United States took Putin’s side against
   his own Justice Department and his own intelligence agencies, and
   launched into a rambling discourse about Hillary Clinton’s emails and a
   supposedly missing DNC server that hides the truth about Putin’s
   innocence.

   “You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server.
   Why didn’t they take the server? Where is the server, I want to know,
   and what is the server saying?”

   The server is saying shut up.

   The “server” Trump is obsessed with is actually 140 servers, most of
   them cloud-based, which the DNC was forced to decommission in June 2016
   while trying to rid its network of the Russian GRU officers working to
   help Trump win the election, according to the figures in the DNC’s
   civil lawsuit against Russia and the Trump campaign. Another 180
   desktop and laptop computers were also swapped out as the DNC raced to
   get the organization back on its feet and free of Putin’s surveillance.

   But despite Trump’s repeated feverish claims to the contrary, no
   machines are actually missing.
   “Despite Trump’s repeated feverish claims to the contrary, no machines
   are actually missing.”

   It’s true that the FBI doesn’t have the DNC’s computer hardware. Agents
   didn’t sweep into DNC headquarters, load up all the equipment and leave
   Democrats standing stunned beside empty desks and dangling cables.
   There’s a reason for that, and it has nothing to do with a deep state
   conspiracy to frame Putin.

   Trump and his allies are capitalizing on a basic misapprehension of how
   computer intrusion investigations work. Investigating a virtual crime
   isn’t a like investigating a murder. The Russians didn’t leave DNA
   evidence on the server racks and fingerprints on the keyboards. All the
   evidence of their comings and goings was on the computer hard drives,
   and in memory, and in the ephemeral network transmissions to and from
   the GRU’s command-and-control servers.

   When cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that
   evidence in a process called “imaging.” They make an exact
   byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the
   machine’s memory, capturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at
   the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through
   the victim’s network. This has been standard procedure in computer
   intrusion investigations for decades. The images, not the computer’s
   hardware, provide the evidence.

   Both the DNC and the security firm Crowdstrike, hired to respond to the
   breach, have said repeatedly over the years that they gave the FBI a
   copy of all the DNC images back in 2016. The DNC reiterated that Monday
   in a statement to the Daily Beast.

   “The FBI was given images of servers, forensic copies, as well as a
   host of other forensic information we collected from our systems,” said
   Adrienne Watson, the DNC’s deputy communications director. “We were in
   close contact and worked cooperatively with the FBI and were always
   responsive to their requests. Any suggestion that they were denied
   access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely
   incorrect.”

   The FBI declined comment for this story, but in testimony before the
   House Intelligence Committee last year, then-director James Comey said
   that Crowdstrike “ultimately shared with us their forensics.”

   At that same hearing, Comey complained that the DNC didn’t give the FBI
   direct access to the DNC’s servers. It’s unclear why Comey wanted the
   FBI operating on the DNC’s live network, but if the DNC demurred it
   wouldn’t be an unusual call, particularly five months before election
   day.

   “The FBI is looking to investigate and prosecute crimes, and we’re
   looking to return a system to operation as quickly as possible with
   minimal impact,” said Rendition Infosec’s Jake Williams, one of several
   incident response professionals interviewed for this story. “I can tell
   you honestly that had I been part of that incident response, I would
   not have advocated calling in the FBI. Every minute the FBI spends
   keeping the actors in play, that’s a minute I don’t get back in
   prepping for the election. I would absolutely have shared images with
   them.”

   Kenn White, a security expert and former DHS adviser, agreed that the
   FBI wouldn’t have expected direct access to DNC’s computers, “The FBI
   had one of the best cyber security firms in the world giving them
   forensics, and going in depth and reverse engineering to the byte level
   these implants and turning it over.”

   In some versions of the servergate conspiracy theory now espoused by
   Trump, nothing less than physical possession of the hardware will
   suffice, because Crowdstrike, a respected security firm helmed by a
   former senior FBI agent, might be part of the deep state’s efforts to
   frame Putin. White scoffs at that notion, noting that National
   Republican Congressional Committee is one of Crowdstrike’s customers.

   “I’ve done incident response for defense contractors and healthcare
   groups, this is all standard practice,” said White. “It’s completely
   defensible in terms of best practices and what was going on.”
   “We were in close contact and worked cooperatively with the FBI. Any
   suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their
   investigation is completely incorrect.”
   — DNC's Adrienne Watson

   It’s also consistent with the Department of Justice’s electronic
   evidence manual, which recommends capturing images when practical even
   when the FBI is executing a search warrant against a uncooperative
   suspect. When the computers belong to a cooperating victim, seizing the
   machines is pretty much out of the question, said James Harris, a
   former FBI cybercrime agent who worked on a 2009 breach at Google
   that’s been linked to the Chinese government.

   “In most cases you don’t even ask, you just assume you’re going to make
   forensic copies,” said Harris, now vice president of engineering at PFP
   Cyber. “For example when the Google breach happened back in 2009,
   agents were sent out with express instructions that you image what they
   allow you to image, because they’re the victim, you don’t have a search
   warrant, and you don’t want to disrupt their business.”

   There’s a final bit of evidence that the FBI got what it wanted from
   the DNC, and it was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington,
   D.C. last Friday: 29-pages of inside details showing exactly how and
   when the GRU’s hackers moved through the DNC’s network on their mission
   to help Trump.

   If the president really wants to know what the DNC server is saying,
   it’s all in the indictment against Putin’s hackers. He just has to
   listen.

CLOAK AND DAGGER

The Epic Honey Trap: A Classic Case Shows Just How Far Moscow Will Go

   The French ambassador looked like an easy target, but 100 operatives
   were called on to get him laid, and get him recruited.

   “Eh bien, Dejean, on couche.”

   With that contemptuous locution, which one might translate very roughly
   as, “Well, De Jean, one gets laid,” with perhaps the added thought that
   having made one’s bed, one must lie in it, Charles De Gaulle dismissed
   his old friend Maurice Dejean from diplomatic service to the Fifth
   Republic.

   It was 1964, six years after the KGB had staged one of its long-running
   and most elaborate honey traps in Moscow against a Western diplomat.
   The operation involved over 100 officers and agents of the KGB

   recruitment of foreigners inside the Soviet Union.

   Researching a book entitled 101 Places to Get F*cked Up Before You Die:
   The Ultimate Travel Guide to Partying Around the World may seem like
   the most fun job ever. But editor David S. Miller stresses there’s more
   to it than one might think. He describes the compilation of wild,
   first-person adventure stories pulled from the community of travel
   writers that comprise the Matador Network as a “Trojan Horse:” the
   sensationally-dubbed cover opens to reveal real cultural experiences.

   The book’s crazy title gave Miller pause when he was first approached
   about the project, but he soon realized there was a lot missing in the
   current travel literature. Most features flaunt the best beaches and
   sunsets, but they lack details on how visitors can have authentic
   cultural experiences. “People are just trying to sell the destination,”
   he says. But he wanted this book to provide readers with “culture and
   stories you wouldn’t find in every travel book.”

   “The whole ethos behind the book is: it doesn’t really matter where you
   go…even in Antarctica or the middle of the Bolivian salt flats…if
   you’re the kind of person who isn’t much of risk-taker, this is a time
   to get out and mix it up,” says Miller.

PROTEST VOTE

The Rhino Who Won an Election by a Landslide

   With two of the most unpopular candidates ever, many voters are
   weighing a protest vote or staying home. Citizens of São Paulo once
   took a different approach—and elected an animal.

   As the day approaches to choose between America’s two historically
   unpopular major party nominees, some Americans still seek an
   alternative.

   Perhaps America’s unhappy undecideds should learn from history and
   write-in a Rhino: no, not a Republican in Name Only, a real rhinoceros
   like Cacareco. She charged ahead of a crowded field in the Sao Paolo
   City Council elections in 1959, earning “one of the highest totals for
   a local candidate in Brazil’s recent history,” The New York Times
   reported.

   A serious impulse triggered this Brazilian charade. On October 8, 1959
   in Sao Paolo, sewers were overflowing, prices were soaring, supplies of
   meat, beans, and voter patience were dwindling. Dismayed by the 540
   candidates running for 45 council seats, some students decided, “Better
   elect a rhinoceros than an ass.”

U.S. Intel: ‘High Confidence’ Russia is Behind DNC Hack

   Updated 04.13.17 3:32PM ET / Published 07.26.16 9:28PM ET

   U.S. intelligence agencies have “high confidence” that the Russian
   government perpetrated a leak of Democratic National Committee
   documents, The New York Times reports. This new consensus, apparently
   reached through an investigation by the FBI and other intelligence
   agencies, supports a theory that Russian agents leaked DNC information
   in an attempt to sway American voters against the party. However, these
   agencies have also clarifed that they are not sure whether the DNC
   documents were obtained in a direct effort to influence election
   results, or whether they were obtained during one of the routine hacks
   Russia and many other governments commit.

   An independent security research firm also concluded a Russian
   government hacker was behind the DNC leak, The Daily Beast reported
   Monday. The Virginia-based ThreatConnect firm found that a group of
   Russian hackers, rather than just one individual, had hacked the DNC
   servers.
