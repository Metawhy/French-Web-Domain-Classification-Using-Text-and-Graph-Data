   Total appeal
   Date of Funding Data 31 August 2019 (1 month ago)
     Highlights
   More than 500,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar have been registered
   in a joint registration exercise by the Bangladesh authorities and
   UNHCR. For many of these refugees, it is the first time they have an
   identity card.
   09 Aug 2019
   UNHCR and other UN agencies worked around the clock to repair damage,
   temporarily relocate affected refugees, and activate disaster response
   plans following eight days of unrelenting rain and wind - the most
   severe weather since the massive Rohingya refugee influx of 2017.
   Between 4 and 12 July, 709mm of rain fell in parts of the Kutupalong
   refugee settlement, out of a July average of about 1040mm for Cox’s
   Bazar. A combination of landslides, floods and wind damaged or
   destroyed hundreds of structures and temporarily displaced thousands of
   refugees.
