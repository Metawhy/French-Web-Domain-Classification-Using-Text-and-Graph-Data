An ultra-low-power atomic clock push toward intelligent IoT

   Scientists at Tokyo Tech, Ricoh co. and The National Institute of
   Advanced Industrial Science and Technology have developed an
   ultra-low-power atomic clock (ULPAC) for small satellites to enable
   future communication systems beyond 5G.

   As present telecommunication innovations keep on developing, the speed
   and sheer amount of data required by users also increases. One way to
   satisfy this need is by using a constellation of nano- or micro-scale
   satellites that circle the planet in low earth orbit.

   Such swarm of satellites requires extremely precise synchronization to
   a global time standard, for which a very precise atomic clock on board
   each unit is necessary.

   Due to the large size of the conventional clock that consumes too much
   power, they can’t be installed on small satellites. Considering this
   issue, scientists at the Tokyo Tech, Ricoh co. and The National
   Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology have developed
   an ultra-low-power atomic clock (ULPAC) for small satellites to enable
   future communication systems beyond 5G.

   Scientists develop these quantum atomic clocks using a method called
   coherent population trapping. Based on this method, scientists have
   recently designed a fully functional atomic clock that surpasses the
   current industry benchmarks. The phase-locked loop in this clock
   consumes an order of magnitude less power than that of previously
   reported devices.

   Moreover, the proposed atomic clock surpasses at presently detailed
   gadgets in two other basic viewpoints: volume occupied and Allan
   deviation. Since powerful utilization of the accessible space on board
   nano/smaller scale satellites is of the substance, so is ensuring that
   the last plan can be made to fit an extremely little volume.

   With respect to Allan deviation, it is a proportion of the steadiness
   of the frequency of a clock; a low Allan deviation suggests a truly
   steady and reliable clock. The atomic clock created by the group is
   likewise looking great in these two fronts too.

   The integrated quantum package The quantum package of the proposed
   low-power atomic clock fits in a volume even smaller than the smallest
   atomic clocks currently available. The integrated quantum package
   The quantum package of the proposed low-power atomic clock fits in a
   volume even smaller than the smallest atomic clocks currently
   available.

   Associate Professor Kenichi Okada from Tokyo Tech said, “The prototype
   of our atomic clock achieves a long-term Allan deviation of 2.2×10−12
   at τ=105 s (the industry standard is 3.0×10−10 at τ=1 s) while
   occupying a volume of only 15.4 cm3 (slightly smaller than the smallest
   currently available atomic clock).”

   “According to the research team, there is room for improvement. The
   total power consumption is 59.9 mW, which is mainly because of the
   microcontroller unit in this prototype and can be further reduced by
   using custom logic circuitry.”

   The final result of this collaboration is a prototype of a very
   promising atomic clock that pushes current benchmarks further so that
   future telecommunications systems, such as those beyond 5G, can become
   a reality.
