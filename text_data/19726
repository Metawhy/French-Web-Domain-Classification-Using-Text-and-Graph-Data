Buffalo Chicken Salad

   September 24, 2019 Leave a Comment

   Dinner salad lovers unite! A crave-worthy meal awaits in the form of
   this rich and tangy Buffalo Chicken Salad. Perfectly seasoned boneless
   buffalo wings are nestled over a crunchy salad base finished with
   avocado and blue cheese crumbles. It’s creamy and satisfying while
   still pulling off that “light and fresh, I had a salad for dinner”
   happy dance feeling.

   I’ve got some pretty simple culinary math for you today. No fractions
   or common core strategies required. Ready?

   It goes something like this:  kickin’ buffalo chicken bites + creamy
   avocado + crunchy salad/slaw situation = your new favorite dinner
   salad.

   Easy weeknight Buffalo Chicken Salad brings ALL of the flavors and
   textures to the table:

       signature sauce
     * Creamy avocado and salty blue cheese – AKA, buffalo chicken’s
       favorite flavor companions
     * The crunchiest salad base tossed in a tangy red wine vinaigrette
