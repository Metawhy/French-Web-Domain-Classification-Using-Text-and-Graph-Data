Our Family Table Farmhouse Makeover

   Antique Finds· Furniture Makeovers· My Story
   23 Sep

   I love a piece of furniture with family history and this family table
   has just that! I’m not sure exactly when this old table came to live at
   mum and dad’s house. It may have been when my Grandfather sold his big
   home in Lawnton, Brisbane, after Grandma went to heaven, and he was
   downsizing to a smaller house. This…

   makeover to either keep or on-sell? This is about the 3rd makeover I’ve

   It’s October! Which means we get to celebrate another two of Miss
   Mustard Seed's Milk Paint beautiful colours.⠀ ⠀ This month’s featured
   colours are Typewriter & Outback Petticoat and they can be found in our
   "Specials" section of our website product menu - all month long - in
   all sizes! (shipping Australia wide)⠀ ⠀ Typewriter is ridiculously
   versatile and a must-have in your MMS Milk Paint collection.  Not only
   is it gorgeous all on its own, but it can be added to other colors to
   darken and tone them down. ⠀ ⠀ Outback Petticoat happens to be the best
   orange to use for painting pumpkins!  Whether they’re paper mache, wood
   or ceramic, it is the most gorgeous shade to use to bring Fall into
   your home.  The name comes from the orange soil of the Australian
   Outback. Early settler women would stain the hems of their white
   petticoats orange from the soil as they walked the terrain, so this
   paint is a nod to Australia’s past. ⠀ ⠀ For the whole month of October
   you can find these colours featured in the "Special" section which you
   can find via the link in my bio.⠀

   💡💡💡Do you have limited space to stage and photograph furniture? In my
   stories today, I show you the process I went through in a very tight
   space, to take pics of this table. 📸 All I used was: - my iPhone X 📲, -
   a few props 💐 and it’s ready to post on Marketplace. 🛒 I’ve saved the
   stories as a highlight on my profile page. 💡 ➡️ find it under the
   heading “Staging”.

   mum and dad’s house. ⠀ ⠀ It may have been when my Grandfather sold his
   big home in Lawnton, Brisbane, after Grandma went to heaven, and he was
   downsizing to a smaller house.⠀ ⠀ This was after I had married and left
   home, but nevertheless it ended up with my parents. I remember mum
   stripping it back to bare wood, removing the layers of paint from over
   the years, and varnishing it. ⠀ ⠀ And that is how it has looked for
   probably the last 25 years or more... until now! ⠀ ⠀ You can see the
   full transformation and family history on my latest blog post, link in
   bio! ⠀

   Check out the makeover I did on this TV Console! I stained the top in
   @fusionmineralpaint’s All in One SFO in the colour “Cappuccino”. The
   outside was painted using Fusion’s “Midnight Blue” and the inside was
   painted with “Little Stork” from their Tones for Tots range. (Swipe —>
   to see before) You can see the full transformation over on my blog
   (link in bio)!
