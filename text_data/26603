   Affinity Photo People's Choice Award

We are delighted to announce the 40 fantastic finalists from the 2019
competition, which has been an absolute treat for the judges with possibly
the best entries we have ever had.

The Overall Winner and Category Winners will be announced on ....

13th November 2019.



WIN AN iPAD!  Have your say (and a laugh) and join in the judging for the
Affinity Photo People's Choice Award.  It's free to enter, it's easy (about
three clicks) and the prize is awesome.


   For those of you that were a bit late entering this year's awards, save
   your photos for next year's competition.  The prizes will be as
   amazing, and no doubt there will be some even better ones on offer!

   Thanks again, and remember to spread the word - this planet is for us
   to enjoy WITH all the other living things on it.

What on earth do they mean by "Conservation through Competition"?

   The Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards, ingeniously titled to avoid any
   confusion, was the result of two factors: Firstly, a need for a
   photography competition that was light hearted, upbeat, possibly
   unpretentious and mainly about wildlife doing funny things. 4years on
   and these objectives seem to have been met. Secondly, and way more
   importantly, this competition is about conservation.

   None of us are perfect, all of us at some point will fly somewhere,
   drive somewhere, cook something, burn something and probably provide
   some direct input into the general warming of the globe. Indirectly, we
   will also have some impact on the animals that share this planet with
   us. So the end result?

   By entering this competition it gives both Paul and Tom and the rest of
   you talented photographers a chance to do a little bit for
   conservation. How? Well… you are now obviously going to go to your
   office, home, pub, club or wherever and talk about the dire need for us
   all to be conservationists in our own little way. Also, perhaps you
   will go to Born Free’s website and have a look at the work they do and
   spread that word as well.

   It’s not a lot necessarily but it is the right step forwards. And one
   step leads to the next step. With your help and the help of Born Free
   it’s way more than we could possibly have done without them and without
   you.

   We hope that you feel the same way, keep clicking and keep appreciating
   the other living things that we live with.


   Thanks, to all of you.

   Paul and Tom


   One of us is the Founder and an inspired wildlife photographer
   (@pj_hicks) and the other one is the grown up Chair of the Judges and
   Competition Director and Landscape photographer (yawn - but admittedly
   he has won not one but TWO awards...? Shut it Tom) (@sullamphoto)
