Prayers offered by Lord Brahma to Lord Krishna

   [lord-brahma-hindu-god.jpg]
   To personally witness God's pastimes and reaction means Lord Brahma was
   quite confused and wanted to check his mystic power, he thought to take
   test. One day Lord Brahma steals the boys and calves while they were
   all lunching with Shree Krishna and kept them all hidden and sleeping
   for one year...
   Lord Brahma returned after a moment ( assumed as one year(per our solar
   calculation))to see what happened actually. Lord Brahma saw that
   Krishna had expanded himself and transformed into the many stolen boys
   and calves into Lord Visnu forms for this full one year, so that the
   mothers of his friends,cows are not disturbed and also to show lord
   Brahma the supremacy of Godhead.
   Lord Brahma was so much perplexed and not able to understand the
   extraordinary mystic powers of Lord Krishna and then when God raised
   the curtain of maya Lord Brahma realized his actual position and
   offered his prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Lord Brahma Is Not Considered As God In Hinduism But As A Creation Of God

Hindu Lord Brahma - A Creation Of God

   [God-brahmaji.jpg]
   The Hindu God of creation, God Brahma is among the three Gods that form
   the Tridev, Trimurti or the Holy Trinity, the other two gods being God
   Vishnu and God Shiva. In Sanskrit, the word Brahma means masculine
   Brahman. In Puranas Lord Brahma has been described as self-born, when
   they depict the story of Brahma’s birth from the lotus flower in the
   navel of Lord Vishnu at the foundation of the universe.
   Hindu God Brahma has got the other name as Kanja - water born and the
   legend according to Purana is there behind this name. It is said that
   he was born in water. That seed was turned into the golden egg and
   later into the entire Universe of Lord Brahma.
   According to legend,  Brahma have created eleven Prajapatis named
   Narada,
   Atri,
   Marichi,
   Bhrigu,
   Kratu,
   Pulastya,
   Angirasa,
   Vasistha,
   Pulaha and
   Daksha
   These all are considered to be the fathers of human race.
   Lord Brahma also created the Saptarshi or the seven great sages as the
   aim was to aid Him in the process of creation of the universe.
   These all sages were referred to as "Manas Putras" as they took birth
   from the mind of Brahma.
   Hindu Goddess Saraswati, is said to be as goddess of learning, and the
   consort(wife) of Brahma.

Myth

   At the beginning of time Vishnu and Brahma came to a huge Shiva linga
   and set to find its beginning and end. Vishnu taking the form of a boar
   digging down into the earth while Brahma taking form of a swan began
   flying up. However neither can find the beginning or end. Vishnu found
   Shiva and bowed down to him. Brahma did not give up so easily as he was
   flying up he saw a ketaki flower, Shiva’s favorite flower. He ask the
   flower to lie about Brahma’s discovery about Shiva’s beginning. When
   Brahma told his tale to Shiva, he was angered by this. Shiva then
   cursed him that no one will ever worship him.

   Hindu God Brahmaji Image
   [Hindu+god+brahmaji+image.jpg]
   About Lord Brahma - The Generator
   Hindu God Brahma is the Generator or creator of the whole universe and
   first member of Hindu Trinity or Brahmanical triad, he includes second
   Lord Vishnu-the preserver and third Lord Shiva-the destroyer.
   Lord Brahma is said to be the son of Brahman-the supreme energy of male
   and Prakrti (Maya)-energy of female.
   Creation or Birth of Lord Brahmaji
   God Brahma is the God of creation and referred to in many texts as self
   born- Swayambhu or unborn- aja. He is not created by anyone as he is
   self existent and the first cause of all and existing by his own
   intrinsically powers.
   God Brahmaji is considered as the infinite and the source of all space,
   causation, time, forms and names, has many instructive and interesting
   designations. Lord Brahma is the first person who self born and is
   referred as uncreated creator- Swayambhu and is the single letter- eka
   aksharam "AUM", theologically.
   Philosophically, Lord Brahma is also considered as the first
   demonstration of one’s cosmos or creation “ahankara” and cosmologically
   he is the golden embryo-hiranya garbha, the ball of fire from which the
   whole universe expands. All beings are his progeny as Lord Brahma is
   the Prajapati.

   The names of Lord Brahma
   According to Mythology, Bhagwan Brahma is described as springing from
   the lotus (Kamala) flower that is grown from the navel (nabhi) of Lord
   Vishnu. That’s the reason that God Brahma is also well-known as Nabhija
   - navel born.
   Hindu God Brahma has got the other name as Kanja - water born and the
   legend according to Purana is there behind this name. It is said that
   he was born in water. That seed was turned into the golden egg and
