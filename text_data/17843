Dupe it up: 4 Korean beauty holy grail finds!

   Posted on July 31, 2015July 31, 2015 by inge1415

   You might want to think twice before shelling out the big bucks for
   that night essence. Here are four high end dupes you can find in Korea
   (and purchase online) for a fraction of the cost.

   1) Estee lauder advanced night repair vs. Missha time revolution night
   ampoule

   image

   The Missha serum has been said to be almost an exact dupe to Estee
   lauders advanced night repair. I bought it for my mom when she visited
   for ‚Ç©33,000 (about $29.00 USD) but you can purchase it for $50.00 on
   sokoglam.com . Compare that to the $91.00 estee lauder serum in the
   same size, and its a steal.

   But how does it compare? Head over to skin and tonics review HERE to
   read an amazing breakdown of not only pricing and ingredients, but
   review over months of use as well.

   2) Urban decay eye primer vs. Etude house eye primer

   Having used the first product,  I was shocked and overjoyed with the
   amazing quality and price of the etude house dupe! When you experience
   humidity like Korea has in the summer, a good primer is a staple in
   your routine. Come the price of $24 for urban‚Äôs to ‚Ç©6,000 ($5.00) for
   etude‚Äôs, and it is even more worth it.

   You can purchase it for $7.00 at sokoglam  or for $8.00 at memebox.

   3) SK ii facial treatment essence vs. Missha time revolution essence.

   And Missha does it again,  with an affordable and highly rated dupe for
   a very high end product! Coming in at $110.00 USD, SK ii is said to be
   well worth the money. However, for between $35-50.00, Missha takes the
   win again.
   Buy it on sokoglam or memebox.

   For another amazingly written  breakdown of the ingredients and a
   review, head to skin and tonics review HERE. She writes such well
   researched and planned reviews, it‚Äôs worth the glance!

   4) makeup forever HD powder vs. Innisfree anti-sebum powder

   image

   image

   My best friend, who lives with oily skin, is in love with this dupe, as
   am I! I love the soft finish and how it helps to keep my makeup in
   place, without drying out my already dry/normal skin.
   Coming in at ‚Ç©6,000 ($5.00) vs. $19-34.00, it is a steal!

   Buy it from memebox for $9.00. You can also purchase a non loose powder
   version for $12.00

   May your bank accounts stay fuller and your skin look even better!

Surviving Korea (1): 5 things to know before arrival

   Posted on July 30, 2015July 31, 2015 by inge1415

   (note: this blog post is directed at those applying for teaching
   positions through EPIK, but may prove helpful for others coming to
   Korea through different companies)

   There are definitely some things I wish I would have known before
   arriving in Korea. My trials and tribulations are here to help you!
   Here are some things to be prepared for!

   1) YouTube apartment tours
   image

   Like many prospective teachers, when I made it through my EPIK
   application process, I instantly went to YouTube to learn about what my
   future life may look like.  Let me tell you‚Ä¶the chances of you getting
   that apartment with that small loft? Pretty remote. Most of my fellow
   teachers were welcomed into a one room studio that is about the size of
   a bedroom in the USA. Studios with a loft can actually be expensive to
   rent, therefore it is not common that your school would have one for
   you. Don‚Äôt be dismayed though! I actually quite enjoy my little space.
    It has everything I need and although I don‚Äôt entertain guests very
   often (mine, although the newest, also is the smallest, about 1/3 to
   half the size of some of my friend‚Äôs studios) the space is 100% mine
   and you will find you really didn‚Äôt need that much space to begin with!

   2. Hawaiian pizza and cookie dough

   image

   My search for either of these (without making it myself) has so far
   proved fruitless‚Ä¶.(get it? No pineapple üòâ ) If you want cookie dough,
   you will need to make it yourself‚Ä¶but you will have to go to Costco to
   get butter that isn‚Äôt sweet.

   BUT‚Ä¶Korea has a great selection of different pizzas, from potato, to
   quesadilla pizzas, beef pizza, and more! As long as you don‚Äôt mind that
   it comes with corn! It can be very expensive. Dominos and pizza hut are
   definitely now out of my price range. That is where pizza school comes
   in. 6,000 won for a pepperoni pizza? Dream come true.

   (killer cookie dough craving? Baskin robins is in Korea, and the
   brought along their cookie dough ice cream.)

   3) Surrounded but lonely

   One thing I highly recommend is to take Korean classes. Do you need to
   speak Korean to survive here? Not at all! But there will come a time
   where you are at lunch with your fellow teachers at your school and
   everyone is speaking Korean.  When you first arrive, that can be pretty
   isolating to say the least. So the more you learn before you arrive,
   the more you‚Äôll understand their conversation and the less isolated you
   will feel. Plus, they love it when you try and speak Korean! Koreans
   are incredibly supportive and helpful when you express interest in
   learning Korean! (and many will also happily teach you about their
   culture as well!)

   image

   4) Wait‚Ä¶where is my bed?

   Be prepared for what one of my orientation teachers called ‚Äúthe Korean
   surprise!‚Äù Don‚Äôt take for granted that your apartment will be
   furnished. Don‚Äôt feel entitled that your school should have bought it
   for you‚Ä¶you school already  will cover your rent and put down the
   deposit on your apartment. EPIK set up the extra 300 in your first
   paycheck for a reason.  I know a few teachers who were exhausted and
   finally reached their apartment only to find that nothing was in it.
   Be prepared that this might happen‚Ä¶ask your coteacher on your first day
   if there is anything you might need for your apartment. If you arrive,
   open the door, and your apartment is empty, turn and ask where the
   nearest Home plus or Emart is. You can buy floor sleeping pads and
   comforters and pillows there. Also, that 300 dollars won‚Äôt be there
   until the end of the month so bring enough money for the first month
   and some extra just in case. EPIK recommended 1000 dollars (keep an eye
   on the exchange rate). I would say you can easily live on that. Want to
   buy a bed frame and mattress for your empty apartment?  Just be patient
   and wait for your first  paycheck.  Being frugal at the start  is a
   good way to go!

   5) Wait‚Ä¶.is this a steamy shower or an icebox?

   If you arrive in August, be prepared for muggy and sweaty for your
   first few months.

   If you arrive in February‚Ä¶it will be cold, but spring starts in April
   and it will start to warm up. In the meantime, it is pretty cold‚Ä¶then
   again I hail from Oregon in the USA‚Ä¶it rarely goes below freezing
   there‚Ä¶

   I hope those first 5 tips prove helpful! If you have any other
   questions, please post your questions in the comments below and I will
   try to answer them!

What I learned in my first 4 months as a beauty Youtuber.

   Posted on December 18, 2015December 18, 2015 by inge1415

   One of the bigger questions wondered about in today‚Äôs day and age is
   typically about social media influencers. What does it take to become
   one? How much do they earn?
   Social media influencers make it look easy, and the large paycheck they
   can earn (Those with over 100,000 Instagram followers can make $1000
   from a company for a single picture with their product, and the number
   one youtuber, Pewdiepie, reportedly earns up to 40,000 dollars a month
   from his videos and sponsorships) has made being an influencer
   a desirable job. YouTube is flooded by up and coming youtubers and
   Instagram‚Äôs most popular tags are focused on getting more likes and
   followers (#like4like, #likeforlike, #l4l, #followforfollow, etc.)  But
   how feasible and attainable  is the idea of becoming a Youtuber?

   Well the best way to learn is by doing. So, I did.

   So what did I learn? What strategies work the best and what strategies
   fall flat?

   1) It is a marathon, not a race.

   All those ideas of you amassing 1,000 subscribers in the first month?
   It‚Äôs a great dream to have however, not a very attainable one. Growth
   on a channel is slow. Studies have found that channel growth typically
   begins to speed up after accumulating 1,000 subscribers, but getting to
   1,000 subscribers is not an easy feat. Let‚Äôs put this in perspective‚Ä¶

   I started with my first video on July 31st, 2015.  It amassed 40 views
   within the first 2 weeks, and was lovingly filmed with my Samsung
   Galaxy s5. I attained 6 subscribers from that video.

   Fast forward to today where my videos now achieve 45-100 views the
   first day I post and I average 4 subscribers a day. And this is with
   167 total current subscribers.  Sounds great, but this means for 5
   months of videos and hours of work, I average less then 40 subscribers
   per month.

   2) Time you put in/ Content  = Subscribers.

   The more time you invest in promoting yourself as a brand, editing for
   great videos, interacting with other youtubers, and interacting with
   your subscribers, the more subscribers you get.

   For example, when I invested in a better camera and spent time planning
   and editing my videos, the amount of subscribers and views I got
   greatly increased.  I set small goals for myself and achieved them.
   Within the first 3 months, I hit my goal of 50 subscribers.

   Strategy: I then reached out to my social media following, friends on
   Facebook, and Twitter, and set a goal of 100 followers by the end of
   November.  I released a video and included a giveaway, stating that
   once I reach my goal, I would choose 2 subscribers as winners for my
   giveaway.  My channel (and Instagram) grew, and by November 31st, I had
   106 subscribers.  So, pretty good growth, going from 50 subscribers in
   3 months to 50 subscribers in one month.

   Strategy 2: I was still not engaging with the YouTube community as much
   as I could.  I set out to commenting on more videos, supporting other
   youtubers, and making the effort to interact with people who had the
   same goals as mine. 18 days later, I have grown by 60 subscribers.
   (note the paragraph under #4, ‚Äú‚Äìreach out‚Äù, written below! )

   3) You will not be rolling in dough.
   Youtubers make around $1 for every 1000 views on their video, but this
   is more related to how many clicks the ads get. The more subscribers
   you have, the more may click on your ads, the more money you make make.
    Most of the money youtubers earn is actually through sponsorships.
   You can get sponsorships through host websites however, again, you
   usually cannot apply to work with a company until you have between
   1,000 to 5,000 subscribers (depending on the host website).  Having
   1,000 subscribers does not mean you will start getting calls from big
   brands. The more subscribers you have, the more desirable you will be.
    Think of the youtubers with 30,000 to 50,000 subscribers. They
   typically start coming out with more of the sponsored videos and are
   sent more products.

   How much did I make?  From when I became monetized (about a month ago)
   until now, I have made ‚Äúaround‚Äù a dollar. So 5-8 hours of work per
   video, 4 videos released within 30 days, that means I made about 4
   cents an hour.

   4)  What the websites tell you is true.

   Every video and website article on growing subscribers will tell you
   the same basic points. Here they are for you, summed up.

   ‚ÄìLet your audience know your brand
   why you are making videos, make them feel like you are talking TO them,
   you relate TO them
   ‚ÄìMake your YouTube page look professional:
   Take time making your videos. Look at successful channels and see how
   they have branded the appearance of their channel. Picmonkey.com is a
   great free resource to make professional looking thumbnails and cover
   picture.
   ‚ÄìLIGHTING.
   Use natural light if you don‚Äôt have professional lighting. take the
   time to look at your video and make sure you are not too blurry,
   overexposed, or dark. Filming at night? Not a great idea unless you
   have professional lighting. Even a great camera will have trouble in
   low light.
   ‚ÄìReach out
   comment, subscribe, and make friends in your YouTube community. Do
   collaborations with people (I currently have 3 in the planning
   process), listen to your subscribers.  Now, reaching out does not mean
   spam!  I am much more likely to check out the page of a subscriber who
   leaves a nice and thoughtful comment instead of one who asks me to
   check out her channel.  One seems genuinely interested in me and my
   content while the other has a motive and invests no actual interest in
   MY content.  Genuine comments establish relationships which leads to
   subscribers, collaborations, and eventually even a great friend!
   ‚ÄìUtilize social media.
   Have a Facebook, Instagram, or a twitter? Use these platforms to help
   gain exposure for your videos.
   ‚ÄìTAGS
   The tags you use make a HUGE impact on your views.  generic tags that
   are used often (such as #beauty, #haul, etc.) will not bring you to the
   top of the search page.  Tubebuddy is a fantastic free service that has
   a tag explorer.  It can tell you how often that tag is used vs. how
   often it is searched for and will give you a percentage based on that
   information. Anything less than 70% I usually avoid.
   ‚ÄìSeasons
   Be aware of what videos are popular during those seasons! For example,
   post a Halloween DIY or tutorial the week before Halloween. make a
   ‚ÄúBack to school outfits‚Äù video in July! Bethany Mota uses these tools
   and has a huge increase in subscribers every summer.

   I don‚Äôt know what the next few months will bring, but I hope to keep
   you updated üôÇ   In the meantime, I would love for you to let me know if
   this helped you! What was your YouTube growth? Are there any tips you
   use that you found to be successful?

Sheet Masks 101: How to revolutionize your skin care regime.

   Posted on November 2, 2015November 2, 2015 by inge1415

   If you wander around Seoul, South Korea, you will notice the gleam of
   radiant skin that seems to echo from almost every Korean‚Äôs face. How is
   it that many Koreans look 5 to 10 years younger than they are?

   Beyond just simple genetics, the Korean stereotype of amazing skin
   stems from 4 different things:
   1) Many visit the dermatologist like we visit a doctor. Once or twice a
   year!
   2) A multi step skin care regime for morning and night that includes
   cleanser, toner, serum, and moisturizer.
   3) A habit of putting sun cream on everyday, and including it in many
   face creams, foundations, etc.
   4) A once a week sheet mask.

   The question I posit today is‚Ä¶.what is a sheet mask and why should you
   include it in your skin care regime?

   Essentially, sheet masks are sheets made of cotton, other fibers, OR
   hydrogel, that are often infused with a serum or other products that
   are great for your skin.  Setting a face mask on your face for 15
   minutes gives your skin more moisture and allows for the vitamins and
   other ingredients to have more time to ‚Äòwork their magic‚Äù.

   Not only is using a sheet mask incredibly relaxing, but they have sheet
   masks for every problem under the sun.  Skin feeling dull? No problem!
   We have a sheet mask for that! Oily skin got you down?  Don‚Äôt sweat it,
   there‚Äôs a sheet mask for that! Moisture? anti aging? acne breakout?
   redness? Name it, and there is a sheet mask for it.  Not feeling like
   buying a mask? You can even buy packs of the masks that are just the
   face cloth and use your own serum to make one.  It‚Äôs a much cheaper way
   to get that SK II mask you‚Äôve been wanting to try! (Check out my
   ‚ÄúKorean dupes‚Äù post to find a Korean dupe for the SK II essence)

   Sheet masks in Korea are also amazingly cheap, and often go on ‚Äúbuy 10,
   get 10‚Äù sales.  Typically a sheet mask is used once a week but it can
   be used more often than that.

   Typically a sheet masks is applied in this order:
   1) wash your face.
   2) Use a toner and wait 1 minute. Think of a toner as something that
   helps your skin to be extra receptive.
   3) Put sheet mask on. Only leave it on for the 10-15 minutes (or the
   recommended time). If you leave it on until it is dry, it can actually
   wick moisture from your face.
   4) Take sheet mask off and pat extra essence onto neck.
   5) Pat face to help the extra essence be absorbed.
   6) My last trick- put on a moisturizer. I feel it helps absorb the rest
   of the essence and helps with the slight ‚Äústickiness‚Äù that can happen
   with some sheet masks.

   I suggest using before bed because some masks are sticky and it can
   take time for the extra essence to absorb into the skin!

   But what about the purchased sheet masks make them so great?  Their
   ingredients of course! Instead of typing out huge long lists of each
   mask and ingredient, I made a video that breaks down my favorite masks
   and sheet masks by the problems they help with, and then I also break
   it down further and explain some ingredients in each masks and what
   they do.

   (Feel free to jump to the Youtube page and check the description box if
   you don‚Äôt feel like watching the whole thing. You can choose what your
   skin issue is and I listed the video start time for it!)

Bestsellers: The TOP products from Korean Beauty brands you love <3

   Posted on November 2, 2015November 2, 2015 by inge1415

   There are many blogs on the internet which will spout the newest ‚Äúfads‚Äù
   in Korea in skin care and beauty, as well as what are the bestsellers.
   However I found there to be a common issue for many of them‚Ä¶.

   I‚Äôve never heard of the products.

   Flouncing through Department stores and road shops on a pretty routine
   basis should mean that I would have some familiarity with the brands in
   question.  I do spend way too much of my time researching new brands I
   come across and testing the newest products‚Ä¶However, blogs never cease
   to amaze me by proclaiming the ‚ÄúNewest Korean must have beauty
   items!‚Äù‚Ä¶.that I have never head of.

   ‚Ä¶and by never heard of, I mean never seen in any beauty store I have
   entered‚Ä¶.ever.

   So I hit the streets of Myeongdong in Seoul, South Korea to bring to
   you the current bestsellers at the different road shops in Korea.

   First of all, what is a road shop?
   Road shops differ from the Sephoras and Ultas of the world by only
   containing one brand. Each road shop contains that brand‚Äôs skin care
   and make up products, and did I mention‚Ä¶.they are super affordable?
   Not just affordable‚Ä¶..but the quality in also amazing!  There is a
   reason Korea is known for their beauty products!

   Because there are so many really great road shops, I broke this into
   two blogs, so stay tuned for the second one which should be posted in
   the upcoming weeks.  I also included some extra products that are my
   favorites (or that I know are popular).  Let‚Äôs get started!

   #1)  Innisfree

   So walking into the store I was CERTAIN they were going to give me the
   green tea seed serum‚Ä¶it has been one of their best selling products for
   a long time, but to my surprise they actually ushered me over to the
   Sparkling mineral water essence!  The essence itself comes out in a
   foam, and a little goes a long way.  I‚Äôve been using it for a month now
   and my skin is very moisturized, but that is all the improvement I‚Äôm
   seeing so far.  It seems more moisturizing than the green tea seed
   serum, so it may be a better fit for winter in Korea!

   Innisfree sparkling mineral water essence

   #2) Holika holika

   As I predicted, they showed my their pencil liners. The liners stay on
   great and don‚Äôt smudge! Downsides?  They all have shimmer, which was
   nice for the darker colors, but a little too much for the light colors.
    I decided that I like the Etude house play 101 pencils better. They
   have a large assortment of colors, can be used on your lips/cheeks/or
   eyes, are win up instead of sharpen, and have matte and shimmer shades.
    Both stay on very well when they set also.
   download I have the plum, brown, and light pink üôÇ

   They also showed me their black head removal kit!  I followed their
   instructions exactly (wet the nose with warm water/use after a warm
   shower, leave on for 15 minutes.  wet nose again and put on second
   strip. let dry and sit for 15 minutes, slowly pull off, and then use
   last step nose mask for 10 minutes.) and I found it more effective then
   a Biore nose strip, BUT‚Ä¶.still not a fan of nose strips. I think they
   enlarge your pores and having my nose hairs removed with my blackheads
   is still not my idea of a good time.

   #3) Banila & co.

   The infamous clean it zero was immediately handed to me!  Now, I love
   this because it very easily removes my fake lashes and cleans them
   without any fuss, and down‚Äôt burn my eyes. I have the Innisfree green
   tea cleansing water, and It also removes fake lashes easily, but burns
   in your eyes a little.  I don‚Äôt feel this is a one stop cleanser
   though.  After using the Banila co. clean it zero, I added some of my
   cleansing water to a cotton pad and swiped over my face.  The amount of
   product that was on my cotton pad made me realize that I will always
   need ton use another cleanser after the clean it zero. Consider it a
   make up remover only!

   #4) Tony Moly

   Tony Moly led me to their gel liners and their Tomatox mask!  I can say
   i through love both of these! SO much!!!  I prefer their gel liner that
   doesn‚Äôt come with a brush, it is a little denser and therefor easier
   for me to control.
   tony-moly-backstage-gel-eyeliner-11-diva-gray-4g-free-samples_zpsc75dfe
   5b Their Gel liners come in 5 different shades!

   Their Tomatox mask is amazing. You massage your face, which feels
   great, and the effects are wonderful! My face is brighter and the
   redness is significantly less! However, the effects are temporary. It
   lasts about 6 hours, so It‚Äôs great to use before a night out!

   #5) Too cool for school

   They brought me to their foundation box kit.  basically, it has their
   foundation, a concealer, a highlighter, and a ‚Äúcheek and lip‚Äù color.
   The foundation is good (cream foundation), it‚Äôs dewy and medium
   coverage but it didn‚Äôt break me out. The concealer was fair but does
   leave creases under the eye so you would need to set it!  the
   highlighter was great for that dewy look!
   I have 2 issues I don‚Äôt like.
   1) It only comes in two shades.  This is usual of many of the Korean
   brands, most coming in three shades‚Ä¶but only two? The lightest shade
   was perfect for me‚Ä¶(I am a 110 in Maybelline fit me‚Ä¶.the lightest shade
   there is) So, if you aren‚Äôt a fair skinned person, stay away.
   2) The lip/cheek was WAY too light! I‚Äôm extremely fair, so although the
   color was okay for cheeks, on your lips it washes you out‚Ä¶Think of it
   as the palest light peach‚Ä¶.no thank you. (the lip and cheek color
   appears to be the same for both foundation shades.

YAS! Give me some pumpkin spice pronto!

   Posted on September 24, 2015 by inge1415

   Hey! Fall is here, and with it, fall makeup tutorials! Yaaassssss!
   Hundreds of Youtubers have flooded the internet with their fall makeup
   tutorials.

   Oh‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶I did too.
   And here it is!  An easy eye tutorial using Korean products I have.

   Mind you, it‚Äôs been super nice going from 10 views a day to 55 on my
   one video alone yesterday, but the struggle can be real. (and by
   struggle I mean making sure that I continue to do this for fun
   and‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶stop focusing on numbers. There are more important things in
   life.)

   Without further ado‚Ä¶.here it is! Enjoy! You‚Äôll laugh, you‚Äôll cry,
   you‚Äôll‚Ä¶..okay, you probably won‚Äôt laugh or cry.

How to: The Korean Highschool Look

   Posted on September 16, 2015September 16, 2015 by inge1415

   Its a fairly well known fact that Korean and American beauty standards
   are different, and back to school looks are no exception. Without
   further ado, here are ___ steps to getting that High School look from
   that Kdrama you love. üòâ

   1) The face.
   Put down your bronzer and blush! You won‚Äôt need them for this look.
   Just take a foundation that is your shade and blend it evenly across
   your face. I use a light pink base as well to add brightness. The key
   to this look is an even, pale face.

   Optional: Take a light pale pink or peach/orange blush and, with a
   VERY light hand, apply some to the apples of your cheeks, swiping back
   to your ears. It should be barely noticable when done.

   2) The eyes
   Koreans are not heavy with the makeup for daily activities. You want to
   take an eyeshadow, 1 to 2 shades darker than your skin tone, and blend
   it on your lid so it just peeks out over your crease.

   3) Add some aegyo:
   Take a light shimmery shadow 2 shades lighter than your skintone, and
   highlight the inner corners and ‚Äúaegyosal‚Äù, the cute puffy skin right
   under your eye.

   Optional: Take a contour color (I prefer a light taupe), and lightly
   shade under the aegyosal so it looks more pronounced.

   4)The Puppy Eye
   There are no cats here, just cute puppies! The puppy eye is a technique
   where you line your eyes as normal, but instead of winging it out, you
   drag it down just a little!

   5) Gradient
   Take a concealer and conceal the edges of your lips. Using a red tint
   or lipstick (you can choose pink or orange too‚Ä¶orangy red seems to be
   the most popular right now) Apply some to the very inner portion of
   your upper and lower lip. Then using your fingers or a brush, smudge it
   out so it fades into the concealer, creating a gradient!

   Optional: top with a clear or sheer shimmery lip gloss so lips appear
   fuller!

Korean Empties? the good, the bad, the ‚Äúgod, what‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù

   Posted on September 2, 2015 by inge1415

   So I just decided to launch myself into the land of Youtube recently,
   and I can very certainly say that the launch into Youtube still has me
   rolling around shooting at the ground like a Halo Noob‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

   However, despite the terrible audio, my own nervousness talking to a
   camera (no dating robots for me!), and only having the beautiful thing
   we call a ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù to film on‚Ä¶I‚Äôve found the experience to actually
   be very‚Ä¶fun.

   It‚Äôs a learning process for sure but, here‚Äôs my most recent video.
   Enjoy! (or not üòõ )

5 Korean nail trends I‚Äôm on like donkey kong.

   Posted on July 30, 2015July 31, 2015 by inge1415

   I previously posted about certain Korean nail trends that needed to
   kick the bucket, but what would I be without posting about current nail
   trends I actually enjoy? So here they are‚Ä¶5 current Korean nail trends
   that are the icing on my cake.

   1) GRAPHICALLY FRENCH
   image

   image

   Why have a normally French mani when you can skip the impressionist era
   and go straight for modern art? All you need is a steady hand and a
   brush!

   2) GOING LOCO
   image

   image

   In Korea, they love their nail art. Now, sometimes this can go very
   wrong (I‚Äôm talking about the tiger claws with the crown jewels AND the
   queen herself glued to them), but sometimes, they can go very right.

   3) THE CHIARA FERRAGNI
   image

   image

   Probably the newest trend to hit‚Ä¶makeup roadshop √©tude house and
   Laniege both released stickers with eyes and lips‚Ä¶now your nails can
   look like Chiara‚Äôs line of shoes and purses. Plus, if you hit the small
   local shops in any of the shopping areas, you can get a knock off phone
   case to match. Tread with caution‚Ä¶your nails don‚Äôt want to look like
   mrs. Potato head exploded on them‚Ä¶

   4) CELLOPHANE
   image

   When it is not being used for evil (see previous nail post), cellophane
   can actually take the graphic look that has recently gained popularity
   and give it some glam.

   5) THE CRESCENT
   image

   probably one of my favorite new trends. Unlike it‚Äôs brother, the
   reverse moon, it doesn‚Äôt make me want to re polish people‚Äôs nails‚Ä¶.

   HONORABLE MENTIONS

   1) CARTOON CARTOON
   image

   When done well, this takes you back to the joys of middle school‚Ä¶bask
   street boys, first crushes and‚Ä¶.cartoon network. Yes please.

   2) SWEETHEART MANI
   image

   I usually don‚Äôt like things that are too girly, but this trend that has
   been quite popular (and typically in pastel colors) is so sweet I‚Äôm
   getting cavities.

   That is it for now!

5 Korean nail trends I can‚Äôt get behind‚Ä¶

   Posted on July 30, 2015July 30, 2015 by inge1415

   Trends come and go and here in Korea it‚Äôs no different, but being in a
   society where nail art is much more prevalent than in the states, you
   are bound to come a across a few trends thatdon‚Äôt float your boat!
   Without further ado, here are 5 nail trends that make me feel a little
   titanic.

   1) THE OUTLINE image While this trend is (thankfully) on the out, I
   never understood it‚Äôs initial appeal. It only makes the nail appear
   smaller.

   2 ) THE LONG NAIL image When I was a child, I associated long nails
   with older women who smelled of gardenia perfume. I still find it
   impractical. Anyone with contacts will understand the difficulty of
   trying to get them out when your nails have grown too long! Ouch‚Ä¶

   3) THE CLEAR AND COLORFUL image I‚Äôm instantly brought back to my nail
   art attempts in middle school. I dont mind the colorful change to a
   french mani, but I prefer the choice of one color that draws your eye,
   but doesn‚Äôt blind it.

   4) CELLOPHANE image I have seen this done beautifully, typically when
   the cellophane has a beautiful pearly iridescence that is paired with
   white‚Ä¶but lately this green and white versus black and pink has been
   popping up on many an instagram post. The color clash and graphic
   confusion feels less like art and more like a broken stained glass
   window.

   5) REVERSE MOON image This is the newest fad to be popping up in nail
   shops in Korea, and probably my least favorite. It reminds me of
   acrylic nails that have grown out, and I can‚Äôt shake the urge to want
   to finish painting the nail. I find solice in the fact that trends come
   and go, and that with every trend I don‚Äôt like, there is always one I
   do. üôÇ
