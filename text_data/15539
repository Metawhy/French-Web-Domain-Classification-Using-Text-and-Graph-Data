Welcome to the SwiftMQ Platform

   Enterprise Messaging | Microservices | Realtime Streaming Analytics

   SwiftMQ goes Open Source. Read more here.

SwiftMQ, State of the Art Messaging.

   We help you to get your messages transferred. Reliable, fast and
   standards based. Scale to your needs, from small to large enterprise
   deployments, on-premise or in the cloud. Intercept your messages in
   transit, process and analyze it. Automate your business, create new
   value from your existing data.

Standards Based

   Connect your business applications through JMS or through the new
   standard protocol AMQP 1.0. Even AMQP 0.9.1 is supported. IoT clients
   can connect via MQTT 3.1/3.1.1. And all of them can transparently
   interoperate.

Highly Scalable

   Connect SwiftMQ Routers to build large Federated Router Networks. The
   built-in dynamic routing architecture let's you send from any source to
   any destination transparently. Add clustered queues to scale or build
   large pub/sub domains.

Microservice Platform Included

   Automate anything by using the integrated SwiftMQ Streams microservice
   platform that works on message streams, runs inside a SwiftMQ Router
   and can be easily integrated into existing infrastructures and data
   feeds.

SwiftMQ Open Source

   We strive to put SwiftMQ on a solid foundation and to create a strong,
   collaborative and thriving community. This is the reason why we have
   released our full featured base products under the open source Apache
   2.0 license.

   It gives you the reliability you need, the freedom from lock-in into
   proprietary products and technologies and, of course, the chance to
   participate by joining the community.

SwiftMQ Client

   SwiftMQ Client provides JNDI & JMS to connect to SwiftMQ Routers, the
   CLI admin client to administer router networks, a Filetransfer over JMS
   client to send/receive files of unlimited size over JMS and the famous
   and widely used AMQP 1.0 Java Client to connect to any AMQP 1.0 broker.

SwiftMQ Community Edition (CE)

   SwiftMQ CE is our base product with JMS 1.1, AMQP 1.0/0.9.1, MQTT
   3.1/3.1.1, unlimited routing connections to build large Federated
   Router Networks or pub/sub domains and SwiftMQ Streams, the integrated
   microservice platform to intercept, process, analyze any messages sent
   over queues or topics.

   SwiftMQ UR is for companies who require on-call professional support.
   It expands on the Community Edition with bridges, JMS file transfers,
   distributed transaction support, file replication, professional support
   and SwiftMQ Explorer, a graphical administration console.

SwiftMQ High Availability Edition (HA)

   SwiftMQ HA adds high and continuous (rolling upgrades) availability to
   Universal Edition (UR). With automatic failover and failback, it is
   intended for companies with critical systems that must stay running,
   even during upgrades or failures.

Data Privacy Policy

   Our website may be used without entering personal information.
   Different rules may apply to certain services on our site, however, and
   are explained separately below. We collect personal information from
   you (e.g. name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.) in
   accordance with the provisions of German data protection statutes.
   Information is considered personal if it can be associated exclusively
   to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data protection
   may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the
   Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information
   as to the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and
   processing personal information by the provider.

   See "Contact Address" above.

   Please be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to
   security risks and, therefore, complete protection against third-party
   access to transferred data cannot be ensured.

Cookies

   Our website makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat
   use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber.
   Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and
   stores on your computer. They are used to improve our website and
   services. In most cases these are so-called "session cookies" that are
   deleted once you leave our website.

   To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used
   to automatically recognize you. Recognition occurs through an IP
   address saved to the cookies. The information thereby obtained is used
   to improve our services and to expedite your access to the website.

   You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings
   on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however,
   that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the
   functions of our website.

Server Data

   For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet
   browser transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server
   log files), is collected: - type and version of the browser you use -
   operating system - websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)
   - websites that you visit - date and time of your visit - your Internet
   Protocol (IP) address. This anonymous data is stored separately from
   any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it
   impossible to connect it to any particular person. The data is used for
   statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services.

Purpose of Registering

   We offer you the opportunity to sign up for our website. The
   information entered when signing up, as shown in the registration form
   is collected and stored solely for use by our website. When signing up
   for our website, we also store your IP address and the date and time
   you registered. This serves to protect us in the event a third party
   improperly and without your knowledge makes use of your data to sign up
   for our site. None of this information is transferred to third parties.
   Nor is any of this information matched to any information that may be
   collected by other components of our website.

Newsletter

   Our website offers you the opportunity to subscribe to our newsletter.
   The newsletter provides you periodically with information about our
   services. To receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address.
   We will review the email address you provide for the purpose of
   determining whether you are in fact the owner of the email address
   provided or whether the actual owner of said address is authorized to
   receive the newsletter. When subscribing to our newsletter, we will
   store your IP address as well as the date and time you subscribed. This
   serves to protect us in the event a third party improperly and without
   your knowledge makes use of your email address to subscribe to our
   newsletter. We will not collect any other data. The data thereby
   collected is used solely for the purpose of receiving our newsletter.
   No data is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information
   matched to any information that other components of our website may
   collect. You may cancel your subscription to the newsletter at any
   time. You will find additional details in the email confirming your
   subscription as well as in each newsletter.

Contacting Us

   On our website we offer you the opportunity to contact us, either by
   email and/or by using a contact form. In such event, information
   provided by the user is stored for the purpose of facilitating
   communications with the user. No data is transferred to third parties.
   Nor is any of this information matched to any information that may be
   collected by other components of our website.

Use of Google Analytics with anonymization

   Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google
   Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA,
   hereinafter referred to as “Google“. Google Analytics employs so-called
   “cookies“, text files that are stored to your computer in order to
   facilitate an analysis of your use of the site.

   The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and
   frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is
   transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there.

   We use Google Analytics with an IP anonymization feature on our
   website. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP
   address before transferring it from member states of the European Union
   or signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

   Google will use this information to evaluate your usage of our site, to
   compile reports on website activity for us, and to provide other
   services related to website- and internet usage. Google may also
   transfer this information to third parties if this is required by law
   or to the extent this data is processed by third parties on Google´s
   behalf.

   Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with
   other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed
   by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You
   should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make
   full use of all the functions of our website.

   Google also offers a disabling option for the most common browsers,
   thus providing you with greater control over the data which is
   collected and processed by Google. If you enable this option, no
   information regarding your website visit is transmitted to Google
   Analytics. However, the activation does not prevent the transmission of
   information to us or to any other web analytics services we may use.
   For more information about the disabling option provided by Google, and
   how to enable this option, visit
   https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en

Use of YouTube components with enhanced data protection mode

   On our website we use components (videos) of YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry
   Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, a company belonging to Google Inc.,
   Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

   To this end, we use the “ - enhanced data protection mode - ” option
   provided by YouTube.

   When you display a page that has an embedded video, a connection will
   be made to the YouTube server and the content will appear on the
   website via a communication to your browser.

   According to the information provided by YouTube, in “ - enhanced data
   protection mode -”, data is only transferred to the YouTube server, in
   particular which of our websites you have visited, if you watch the
   video. If you are logged onto YouTube at the same time, this
   information will be matched to your YouTube member account. You can
   prevent this from happening by logging out of your member account
   before visiting our website.

   Further information about data protection by YouTube is provided by
   Google under the following link:

   https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/

Newsletter Consent

   You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data to
   receive our newsletter as follows:

   “I have read the privacy policy and I give my consent to data being
   processed by a service provider located in the United States”.

   We use the newsletter to provide you with regular updates about our
   offers. To receive our newsletter, you will need a valid email address.
   We will then check the email address entered to ensure that you are
   actually its owner or if its owner has agreed to receive our
   newsletter. By registering for the newsletter, we will save your IP
   address and date and time of registration. This will be used in case a
   third party misuses your email address to subscribe to our newsletter
   without your knowledge.

   We will not compare the data collected during newsletter registration
   with any other data that might be collected by other components of our
   site.

Newsletter by MailChimp

   We use MailChimp to send our newsletter to our subscribers. MailChimp
   is a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means
   Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA.

   The data stored when you registered for the newsletter (email address,
   name, IP address, and time and date of registration) will be sent to a
   server operated by The Rocket Science Group in the United States and
   stored there in accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield.

   Further information about the data protection offered by MailChimp can
   be found at:

   http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/

   Further information about the EU-US Privacy Shield can be found at:

   Die Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit

   http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/eu-
   us-privacy-shield/index_en.htm

   You may cancel your newsletter subscription and revoke your consent to
   the storage of this data at any time with future effect. For
   instructions to take this step, please refer to the confirmation email
   and each newsletter.

Newsletter tracking

   Our newsletter includes so-called web bugs that allow us to recognise
   if and when an email has been opened and which links in the email have
   been clicked by its recipient.

   This data is stored by us so that we can best align our newsletter to
   the wishes and interests of our subscribers. Accordingly, the data thus
   collected is used to send personalised newsletters to each recipient.

   You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data as
   follows:

   “I agree that my data and my user responses will be stored
   electronically by newsletter tracking so that I can receive a
   personalised newsletter. The revocation of the consent to receive the
   newsletter constitutes a revocation of the consent for the tracking
   described above.”

   By revoking the consent to receive the newsletter, the consent to the
   aforementioned tracking is revoked.

Use of Google-Adwords

   For purposes of promotion, our website also employs the Google ad tool
   "Google-Adwords". As part of this, our website employs the analysis
   service "Conversion-Tracking" from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre
   Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as
   “Google“. If you access our site by way of a Google ad, a cookie is
   placed on your computer. Cookies are small text files that your
   internet browser downloads and stores to your computer. These so-called
   "conversion cookies" cease to be active after 30 days and are not used
   to identify you personally. If you visit certain pages of our website
   while the cookie is still active, we and Google know that you, as user,
   have clicked on ads placed on Google and were redirected to our site.
   Google uses the information obtained through "conversion cookies" to
   compile statistics for our website. These statistics tell us the total
   number of users who have clicked on our ad as well as which pages of
   our site were then accessed by each user. However, neither we nor other
   advertisers who use "Google-Adwords" receive any kind of information
   that can be used to personally identify users. You can prevent the
   installation of "conversion cookies" by making the appropriate change
   to your browser settings, for example by setting your browser so that
   the automatic placement of cookies is deactivated or by blocking
   cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com“.
   You can obtain the relevant data privacy policy from Google at the
   following link:

   https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html

Information/Cancellation/Deletion

   On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at
   no cost if you have questions relating to the collection, processing or
   use of your personal information, if you wish to request the
   correction, blocking or deletion of the same, or if you wish to cancel
   explicitly granted consent. Please note that you have the right to have
   incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted, where such
   claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this data.
