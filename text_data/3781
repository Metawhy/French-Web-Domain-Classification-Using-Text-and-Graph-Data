       hello — i was using the free version and it worked perfectly. When
       I clicked on my Posts page (which I called Portfolio), all my posts
       came up. I upgraded to the Pro version today and now, all my posts
       disappeared off that page. I have changed nothing else. Please
       help. website: sageandspiritphoto.com
       Second, I cannot figure out how to add my Instagram link to my
       website. Can you help me with this? I looked at the theme
       instructions but it does not tell me how to initially add the
       instagram link to the social menu then add the widget (i think
       that’s what I need to do? Not sure) — at any rate, step by step
       instructions would be helpful. Thank you

       Hi — on the second question, I figured out how to add the social
       menu to my footer but I’d really like to add it to the sidebar
       instead. I tried adding a CT: Social widget to the sidebar but that
       only showed links and not the social media icons. Of course, the
       posts not showing up is a bigger problem. Thanks again for any
       help.

       @boonanalytics: Hello there,
       Can you check if Portfolio Section is still on?
       Go to => Appearance => Customize => Theme Options => Portfolio
       To have social links in the sidebar
       There seems to be a little issue withe the CT: Social Icons widget.
       I will look into the issue and get back to you soon.
       Kind Regards,
       Skandha

       Hi – thank you for your response, and for looking into the CT icons
       widget issue.
       Regarding the posts, if I enable Portfolio, then the posts appear
       on my home page (whether I pick homepage or entire site as my
       option for where I want it enabled). I am not looking for my posts
       to appear on my home page. My intent is for my Home Page to be a
       static picture (just as it looks now). In the top right hand
       corner, I have a link called Portfolio — this is simply my posts
       page (which I have titled Portfolio). In the free version, when I
       clicked on that Portfolio link, my posts came up, which was
       perfect. When I upgraded to the Pro version, for some reason that
       Portfolio link points back to the home page (I think or maybe it
       points nowhere) instead of to my posts (not sure why). The
       Portfolio page is still showing as my posts page in WordPress and
       the permalink for that page does show correctly (i.e. url/portfolio
       not the home page or any other page). I did not actually change any
       of that when I made the switch from free to Pro. I’m not sure what
       happened with the switch to the Pro that somehow changed that page
       so it no longer shows the posts. Please let me know if I can
       provide you any more information. Thank you very much!

       issue. Thank you.

       HI
       I am testing the theme and experienced this problem when I tested
       the search function.
       It displayed Ok in desktop mode but not in mobile mode.
       Can you help rectify it as I couldn’t find anything in the FAQ.
       my test site is at https://staging.goldspark8.com
