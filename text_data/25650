     My 2 tutorials BOOKS are coming BACK to KICKSTARTER in the HIGHER
     TIERS of my brother Robin’s How to WRITE campaign THIS OCTOBER 2019!
     BUT! The ONLY WAY to get the books is to join the SECRET LAUNCH CLUB

     date ANYWHERE online ahead of the campaign going live!
     My drawing tutorials books will NOT be on sale ANYWHERE in shops OR
     online outside of Kickstarter for at least the next TWO YEARS, so
     this is a VERY RARE CHANCE to get them!

     I’m sure a ton of people already know how to do this, but I only
     learned recently, so I wanted to share one of my favorite
     thumbnailing tricks! Color matching is SUPER helpful to quickly map
     out potential color schemes :D

     [EDIT] this is in Adobe Photoshop, sorry for forgetting to mention
     that!

     july ‘19 vs september ‘19

     so here’s a tiny tutorial about light reflections (i’m no expert
     though!!)
     image image

     the drawing made in july is lacking on light reflections
     image image

     the one done in september looks much better since i paid attention
     to them

     Also remember that the intensity of the lighting depends on the
     material on which it is reflected, eg. glass / metal / fabrics etc.
     Glossy surfaces reflect the lighting more than matte surfaces

     another example:

   Do you have any tips on how to color the light underside of a dark
   skinned person's palm? How much lighter should it be, and should it be
   pale or have a redder tint like blush? I'm white and I worry I've been
   doing it incorrectly.
   Asked by Anonymous
   afro-ami

   OH   B O I  ~

   Eesh, coloring darkskin palms is one of those things i’m good at doing
   but not so good at explaining, so i’ll try my best on this one

   Okay so starting off

The palm of a dark skin person’s hand is simply just a reflection of their
undertone

   image

   Everyone has an undertone and black people are no different. A dark
   skin person’s palm is a part of their hand that has little to no
   melanin. Without all of that melanin the only thing that’s left is
   their undertone

Black people with an orange undertone tend to have orange looking palms

   image

Black people with a neutral undertone tend to have a mixture of pinkish
orange-ish looking palms

   image

And black people with red undertones tend to have pink looking palms

   image

   So how exactly do you determine the palm color and undertone of a
   darkskin black person?

   ight so  B  O O M,
   image

   When it comes to a black person with a neutral skin tone rather than
   raising the color up in the Spectrum simply just lighten the skin

   Skin tone can be complicated so I made a few examples:
   image

   Make sure when coloring black palms to always add a gradient
   image

   (( Many artists have done this and I too am guilty of it so dont sweat
   it ))

♡Hope these tips help you out♡
