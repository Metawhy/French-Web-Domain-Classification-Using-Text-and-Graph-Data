Protein-Packed Snacks Are Everywhere — But Do You Really Need Them?

   Medically reviewed by Katherine Marengo, LDN, RD, specialty in
   nutrition, — Written by Sarah Garone on September 23, 2019 New
   Share on Pinterest

   Food trends these days have gotten better at begging you to pay
   attention to them. Instead of one brand convincing us it’s the new
   thing, we have every brand collectively on the same train. Today, the
   trend is protein-added foods.

   “Now with 25 grams of protein!” shouts a shiny bar wrapper staring out
   at you at the grocery checkout. Even desserts have this label,
   proclaiming ice cream sandwiches to be a “high-protein indulgence.”
   Uber-protein-ified bars, balls, bites, shakes, and cookies — no food
   has been left behind in this protein rush.

   And after years of vilifying carbs and fats, the uptick in protein in
   American foods makes sense. It’s the one macronutrient we can all agree
   upon.

   Or perhaps it’s because many of us associate it with strength.

   Gym culture particularity encourages the idea that mega-doses of
   protein are the key to staying fit or rebuilding muscle tissue (and, if
   you’re into it, getting totally ripped). Who doesn’t remember the early
   gym goer in middle school who was downing protein shakes after a
   workout?

   It’s true, of course, that the body requires plenty of protein

   Besides just building muscle, this nutrient serves innumerable other
   purposes, like giving structure to cells, regulating fluid balance, and
   creating enzymes that facilitate bodily functions.

   Obviously, it’s a good idea to eat foods that provide enough of it. But
   what exactly is enough — and are protein-loaded snacks the answer?

   Compared to the placement and popularity of high-protein products,
   protein requirements per standard governmental nutrition advice
   actually appears quite low. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for
   protein for adults is just 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. By
   this standard, a 170-pound person needs only 58 grams of protein per
   day — less than what you’d find in a single serving of steak.

   But many nutrition experts point out that calculations like these
   aren’t one-size-fits-all, and a variety of factors go into
   understanding individual protein needs.

   “The DRIs for protein are based on studies that estimate the minimum
   amount of protein needed to prevent deficiencies, which is different
   than the amount needed to promote optimal health,” says Ali Webster,
   PhD, RD, of the International Food Information Council.

   “Optimal protein intake is likely higher than this benchmark and is
   probably different for everyone: It can vary depending on age, sex, if
   a woman is pregnant or lactating, and level and type of physical
   activity,” she says.

   If you’re shooting for weight loss, it’s also definitely a mistake to
   underestimate your protein needs.

   “I have certainly had clients who are restricting their food intake or
   think they are making healthy choices but are actually low on protein
   intake,” says board-certified sports dietitian Mitzi Dulan, RD, CSSD,
   of Simply Fuel. “Protein helps to satisfy, so I’m often getting people
   to increase their protein so they feel more satisfied to help assist
   with weight loss.”

   On the other hand, overdoing it on protein is a real possibility

   “You really don’t ever need to go over 2 grams of protein per kilogram
   of body weight [per day],” says Dulan. And that’s for athletes. For
   anyone with compromised kidney function, Dulan notes, they should be
   especially careful about taking in too much. (To find how much you
   need, in pounds or based on your workout style, use this calculator.)

   Despite concerns about under- and overconsuming protein, recent
   research indicates that most Americans aren’t at risk of either.

   A 2018 analysis found that the majority of the U.S. population exceeds
   minimum recommendations for this macro, but doesn’t overstep what’s
   considered acceptable.

   Translation: Except for special circumstances, most of us are probably
   doing just fine, protein-wise — so supplementing through high-protein
   bars, balls, and bites is likely unnecessary. This is especially true
   if you think opting for a high protein snack may be healthier than a
   regular snack.

   Many of these popular snacks, blinged-out with protein exclamations,
   are highly processed, contain questionable ingredients, or large
   amounts of sugar and sodium.

   Lenny & Larry’s Complete Chocolate Chip Cookie, for example, may be
   marketed for its 16 grams of protein, but they define a serving as half
   a cookie.

   Likewise, Skinny Cow’s “protein-packed indulgence” Fudgetastic Java ice
   cream won’t actually offer you 23 grams of protein unless you’re eating
   the whole pint. You won’t want to get your power from PowerBar’s
   Cookies N Cream protein bar, either, whose ingredient list reads like a
   mystery novel of syrups and oils.

   So, watch out for labels because brands may not really have your health
   in mind

   We’re not saying ban all high-protein snacks! For people who don’t eat
   meat, dairy, and/or have allergy concerns, these bars could be a real
   life saver. But we also think it’s worth taking a pause to read the
   label before throwing them into your cart.

   “The healthfulness of any food is determined by everything it
   contains,” says Webster. “Make sure you read the Nutrition Facts label
   to see the big picture of how many total calories, types of fat and
   amount of sodium, fiber and added sugars are in a high-protein
   product.”

   If you’re aiming to bulk up or need extra protein for any other reason,
   first try adding it to your diet through whole foods like eggs,
   soybeans, meats, fish, and nuts. (For folks allergic to all the above,
   there are some low sugar options out there, such as R.E.D.D, which you
   can buy online.)

   These foods may not come with fancy packaging boasting their macros,
   but without added sugars or off-the-wall ingredients, they’re probably
   a lot better for you in the long run.

The One Thing You Absolutely Must Clean After Sex

   Medically reviewed by Janet Brito, PhD, LCSW, CST, specialty in sex
   therapy, — Written by Gabrielle Kassel on September 23, 2019 New
     * Washing
     * Butt washing
     * Period washing
     * Toy hygiene
     * Laundry!
     * tl;dr

   Share on Pinterest

   If you’ve achieved a form of sexcellence that resulted in pool of lube,
   sweat, maybe squirt, and even more lube, you might think you need to
   immediately untangle yourself from your partner(s) afterward and have a
   little rub-a-dub in the tub.

   But luckily, Dr. Felice Gersh, OB/GYN, says that doesn’t have to be the
   case! Don’t surrender your sheets to the laundry just yet.

   “Humans are part of the animal kingdom, so like dogs or cats, we don’t
   need any super elaborate post-sex rituals to achieve reproductive
   health or success,” she says.

   The words doing the most work here are “super” and “elaborate.”

   Dr. Renjie Chang, OB/GYN and founder of NeuEve, a women’s sexual health
   product startup, says going to the bathroom post-romp is a good idea,
   especially for folks who are prone to urinary tract infections.

   “Bacteria located outside the body can enter the urethra during sexual
   intercourse and climb up to reach the bladder, causing a UTI,” she
   explains. Peeing helps flush out bacteria and reduce the risk of a UTI.

   Are your bits the one thing you have to clean immediately after sex?
   Trick question. It depends on what you were doing and with what you
   were doing it with? Intact foreskin? Yes. Toys? Yes. Post-anal clean
   up? We got tips on that, and how to keep those sheets clean. Read on.

   1. How to rinse your bits

   A lil wash isn’t a bad idea. For folks with penises, Dr. Gersh says
   gently washing the penis in the shower (or sink, if you can finagle
   that) with a fragrance-free soap is the right move.

   If your foreskin is still intact, Lisa Finn, a sex educator at sex toy
   emporium Babeland, says rolling back the fold and rinsing can keep
   semen or bacteria from building up and causing an infection.

   If you have a vulva, you can gently wipe it clean with a damp,
   soap-free washcloth. “A very brief and gentle finger wash on the outer
   portions with just warm water is best,” says Dr. Gersh.

   Never, ever do anything that could be mistaken for scooping, scrubbing,
   or scraping (even if there’s sperm or lube inside!).

   “The vagina really is a self-cleaning machine, and trying to wash out
   the inside can actually mess with your pH, which increases the risk of
   infection — especially if soap is involved,” she explains.

   tl; dr: Vulva dabbing, not digging.

   Pregnancy and STI risk:

   No matter how thoroughly you clean your bits after sex, you can’t
   reduce the risk of pregnancy or STIs with a wash. If you’re worried
   about either, chat with your healthcare provider.

   2. OK, and what if the butt was involved?

   “The downside of anal play is that it’s possible to come into contact
   with fecal matter or fecal remnants, which are loaded with bacteria,”
   says Dr. Chang.

   Some of that bacteria, if spread to other parts of your body, can cause
   infection. So, if your and/or your partner’s booty-hole got some love
   (with a toy, tongue, or finger) during your sex sesh, a little extra
   cleanup is required. #WorthIt.

   Another piece of advice? Shower your bits anyway.

   While ideally a condom or finger condom/glove was used (hint, hint),
   Dr. Chang says if you have a penis with foreskin and didn’t pull your
   skin back before wearing a condom, then cleaning your head really well
   is a M-U-S-T.

   Note: There’s no post-romp protocol for the receptive partner. “Shower,
   but otherwise leave the rectum alone. You don’t need to do a post-play
   enema or anything like that,” says Dr. Gersh. Good to know.

   3. And what if one of us was menstruating??

   Period sex is as divisive as CrossFit or Spam. But if you’re Team
   Period Sex, you know it can be a little, uh, bloody.

   If you have the foresight, Finn says, “Laying down a towel or a
   [moisture-proof] blanket can be a great way to prevent mess.” (She
   recommends the Liberator Throw.)

   Otherwise, as soon as you can (the longer the stain sits, the harder it
   is to get out), rinse the sheet with cold water and scrub as much of
   the blood out as possible.

   Squirt on some stain remover and let it sit while you and boo do a
   post-romp recap (just me?). Finally, rinse out the remover and toss
   your sheets in the washing machine with some detergent.

   As for your bod? Regular cleaning with warm water and gentle soap will
   do.

   Note: These cleanup tips apply to other forms of blood play, too.
   However, some additional cleanup may be necessary. Any equipment used
   will need to be sterilized, and any cuts should be cleaned carefully.

   Friendly reminder:

   “STI transmission is still a risk when someone is on their period, and
   HIV and hepatitis can be passed through menstrual blood, so practicing
   safer sex practices is still important,” says Finn.

   4. BTW: You gotta take care of your toys

   How and when you wash your toys depends on the material.

   Toys made of porous materials need to be washed right away with
   lukewarm water and mild soap so that the bacteria don’t have time to
   grow, says Finn.

   Porous materials:
     * polyvinyl chloride
     * thermoplastic rubber
     * thermoplastic elastomer
     * jelly rubber
     * latex

   “If it’s made of a non-porous material like silicone, stainless steel,
   glass, Pyrex, or ABS plastics, you can simply wipe the toy down with a
   wet cloth, dry it, and then store it until you have time for a proper
   clean,” she says.

   The next morning, boil the toy in hot water or rinse it again with a
   soapy washcloth.

   5. More sheet-saving tips

   Boning on a bed-turned-Slip-’N-Slide is all cum and games until there’s
   a stubborn salty concoction on your linens. Finn has some quick tips
   for getting said sex stains out of your sheets.

Semen

   Baby gravy is actually full of protein, so you’ll want to stay away
   from bleach, which can turn protein a neat-o yellow color.

   Instead, treat wet cum stains with an enzyme neutralizer before tossing
   the sheets in the wash. Blot dry stains with baking powder before
   washing.

Vaginal fluid/sweat/spit/urine

   Heat can set a stain, so start by rinsing under cold water. Then spritz
   on some enzyme-neutralizing spray or hydrogen peroxide before tossing
   in the washer.

Water-based lube

   Water-based lube will usually come out in the wash. If you’re an
   overachiever, you can soak the sheets in salt and vinegar before
   washing to help lift the stain.

Silicone-based lube

   Dose silicone-based lube splotches with a dish soap or generic stain
   remover, and then use some good old-fashioned elbow grease to scrub up
   the stain and loosen the lube from the material.

Poop

   If there are lil chunks, rinse or brush them off with cold water. Any
   smears can be treated with bleach and hothothot water.

   Cleanup? It’s worth the time

   Cleanup after some slick and saucy sexcapades may be a wee bit
   time-consuming. Luckily, a little foresight will allow you to lay with
   your lover a little longer after getting laid.

   Finn’s recommendation? Invest in an extra towel, a water-resistant
   blanket, a mattress protector, fragrance-free baby wipes, a
   wastebasket, and maybe even some sex toy cleansing spray, like the
   Babeland Toy Cleaner.

   That way you can get wet and wild and enjoy a post-coitus cuddle sesh.

‘But Don't You Care About Health?’ and Other Misguided Beliefs

   Written by Amee Severson on September 24, 2019 New
   Share on PinterestDesign by Lauren Park

   If you’ve spent any time browsing health topics on social media, you’ve
   likely encountered ripples of the anti-diet movement, such as Jameela
   Jamil’s “I Weigh” campaign or the backlash against Macy’s for selling
   plates showing restrictive serving sizes.

   The topic has even managed to make the front page of legacy health
   outlets (see: “SELF” and Tess Holliday).

   If you still feel at a loss or even a bit defensive when people talk
   about Health at Every Size or why diets don’t work, you’re not alone.

   We’ve been conditioned to believe that diets — intentional weight loss
   efforts and wellness plans — are the best, if not the only, solution to
   the “obesity epidemic.” Getting information that blatantly rejects
   long-standing beliefs can feel disorienting!

   But that’s what is important to remember: that the anti-diet movement
   is not an attack on you or your individual actions.

   It’s a movement that promotes overall well-being rather than size
   reduction. It’s a statement that people deserve to exist and don’t have
   to engage in weight-loss attempts to earn respect. The movement targets
   the diet industry and culture at large — not you! And science backs the
   theories behind the movement.

   So let’s walk through these common gut reactions. Since #AntiDiet is
   going to become more common (and for good reason, since the movement
   cares about the whole person), here’s what you need to know.

   1. “You’re right! Diets don’t work! But this isn’t a diet, it’s a
   lifestyle”

   If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck… well, that “lifestyle
   change”? It’s a duck.

   Word got out about “diets not working” in the early 2000s, and diets
   haven’t been calling themselves diets for a long time. Instead, diet
   culture has been slowly moving away from the word “diet.”

   Now it’s about “health.” It’s about “living your best life.” It’s about
   weight, but the letters W, E, I, G, H, and T are silent. Even Weight
   Watchers rebranded as WW in an attempt to capitalize on this movement.

   But just as WW is still about weight, diets are still about weight
   loss. Foods are still being policed and restricted. Rules are still
   imposed. It sure looks like a duck — with a new slogan.

The anti-diet movement still fights that

   The movement is rooted in the belief that a person’s food doesn’t need
   to be policed or restricted with rules and that weight is not the most
   important health marker (or any other marker).

   One way to recognize this particular “duck” is to notice whether a
   wellness plan suggests that achieving health requires weight loss — or,
   these days, whether weight loss is implied.

   Another red flag? Adding morality to food. Food is not moral. It’s
   food. You’re not a bad person for eating a doughnut, nor are you a
   better person for eating kale.

   Because the truth is, the human body is so unique from person to person
   that we can’t predict what will happen to it. By not dieting, you’ll
   have the opportunity to learn what does and doesn’t make your body feel
   its best, and then you can choose what you want to eat. Intuitively,
   you learn.

   2. “I’m following X diet and I believe in it”

   There are so many diets out there. And when you’re following a certain
   diet plan, it’s really easy and normal to feel emotionally invested.
   You kind of have to be! Investment is what makes following a diet for
   any length of time actually work.

   So when someone talks about how diets don’t work, it’s normal to feel a
   bit attacked.

   The larger picture is that the diet funnel is rigged. It’s rigged to
   make you believe not only that your diet is different or superior but
   also that you have to restrict yourself to it in order to be happy,
   healthy, or allowed to participate in the world around you.

And that’s the mindset the anti-diet movement is speaking out against

   Not you, but the system that wants you to believe, this time, that
   another restrictive diet will be different. To get out of that mindset,
   think of it like The Matrix: The more you see it, the more you can’t
   unsee it. It’s systemic bias that you can opt out of participating in.

   It can take a while to feel comfortable going against the status quo.
   It can take a while to be confident living against systemic
   expectations. It won’t be an easy journey, but it will be a freeing
   one.

   And, thankfully, there are ways to navigate that. Intuitive eating is a
   big one: coming back into the trust that we can truly listen to our
   bodies and relearning that our bodies have always been sending us
   signals and giving us feedback.

   3. “I’m too fat — I need to lose weight”

   This is probably the hardest to argue with — not because I agree or
   because I think it’s not healthy or OK to be in a fat body.

   But because it’s hard.

   It’s hard because being in a fat body and not actively trying to lose
   weight, or even — *gasp* — liking your body, can get you labeled a
   social deviant, which is an extremely difficult position to be in.

   But I encourage you to think about ways you can improve your health
   independent of weight.

   Will physical therapy help you be more active, pain-free? Will taking
   fish oils help with your cholesterol? Maybe you’ll feel better and be
   healthier. And maybe your weight will stay the same. And maybe you
   won’t have to add the stress of a restrictive diet.

   4. “But don’t you care about health?”

   We have less control over our health than we have been led to believe.
   The truth is, you can’t learn anything about a person’s health from
   their body size or the way they look alone.

   Even “healthy eating” is only one small factor among all the
   determinants of health. The rest of the health checklist includes
   everything from recreational drug habits to genetics to whether someone
   has access to quality healthcare.

   And that big picture of health is part of the reason the anti-diet
   movement is here.

   The movement wants to help people recognize that not all of health can
   be rectified with food. By accepting this and allowing for other
   lifestyle changes, as well as other definitions of health, we allow for
   a more expansive and nuanced relationship with our bodies.

   5. “But dieting has worked for me — I’ve lost weight”

   Dieting gives most people a honeymoon period — a period when it’s easy
   to lose weight or to keep it off. But then it stops working. Does this
   sound familiar? If it does, it’s because this is the experience of most
   people who try to lose weight.

   A 2012 study that followed participants from adolescence into adulthood
   also noted that people will regain the majority of the weight they’ve
   lost, if not more, within 5 to 7 years. Even if you keep up the
   behavior that led to your weight loss, it’s likely you’ll regain
   weight.

   And that’s because your body interprets dieting as a threat. In my
   professional experience as a dietitian and my personal experience as
   someone constantly bombarded with diets, I’ve never met anyone who has
   maintained weight loss long-term.

   I know it’s not impossible. But I also believe that those folks are
   like lottery winners. Unicorns. A few exist, but banking on that being
   your experience will likely result in some disappointment.

   If this is all true, then what? Well, the anti-diet movement is trying
   to move past the pesky idea that health is about thinness.

   We do this by attempting to call out the impossible beauty standards
   society has created (and we have perpetuated). Because every human is
   worth so much more than their body size and their attempts to change
   it.

   6. “Wow. This tone is really divisive. No one wants to listen to you if
   you’re so angry”

   It’s normal to be angry after you’ve been harmed. And the fat activist
   movement, which was founded by folks with skin in the game? We have
   been harmed.

   A person’s point is not less valid when they’re angry or emotional.
   Anger doesn’t make a point less valid, no matter where it comes from.
   Calling the opposition angry is, at its core, tone policing and
   gaslighting. It reinforces the idea that you must be palatable to be
   worth listening to.

   When you’re in a marginalized body, others tend to label anger itself
   as “out of control,” even if that anger is a valid and true expression.
   It can just add to the “too much”-ness that people use as an excuse not
   to listen.

   Think of another time you may have found someone angry. This social
   pattern has become so ingrained that we don’t notice when it’s being
   done to us or realize when we do it to others.

   And here’s another nugget of truth: Anger is a human reaction. When our
   belief systems about ourselves or the world are challenged, no matter
   how true the challenge is, we get angry. It’s human, and it’s a sign to
   check in.

   Another human reaction? Gaslighting and tone policing, which tend to be
   reactions of fragility.

   If you notice that your response is to set the emotional context of the
   conversation or downplay the reaction of the person without listening
   to what they’re saying, check if you’re feeling defensive. It’s a sign
   that you may not be really listening or that your response might only
   make the other person feel worse.

   Try taking a step back and unpacking the why before responding.

   7. “Aren’t you concerned about the obesity epidemic?”

   In a word: No.

   Obesity was named a disease when the American Medical Association
   decided to name it a disease. The AMA’s own research committee stated
   that the evidence did not a show a direct cause-and-effect relationship
   between obesity and morbidity and mortality.

   Obesity, as a disease state, has also been a questionable diagnosis.
   And the stigma of labeling body size as a disease and attempting to
   treat it as such is far more likely to lead to negative health outcomes
   than the weight itself.

   Researchers also pointed out that establishing social and public health
   campaigns against obesity could cause further stigma and unnecessary
   treatments.

   Anti-diet isn’t about denying that there might be an increased risk
   associated with certain body sizes, but “Fat is killing us” is
   hyperbolic.

“So why is obesity still a problem? Why do doctors warn against it?”

   Again, it’s that rigged system. Yes, bias in medical care and medical
   research affects the way bodies are treated. That’s why the anti-diet
   movement is also a social justice movement.

   We’ve been on this path for so long and the biases are so entrenched
   that we have to change not only the way research is done but also the
   way researchers and medical professionals view fatness.

   The anti-diet movement is for everyone

   It’s about improving healthcare and bringing awareness to mental health
   and to social justice.

   And it’s about you. It’s about recognizing that your body is yours and
   it is unique. It’s worthy of proper healthcare and respect and love —
   regardless of the size of it, the foods you eat, or even the health
   conditions you’re living with.

   The anti-diet movement cares about health. All of it. Mental health,
   cultural health, and lifting up those who have spent their lives
   feeling marginalized and excluded. Emotional reactions are common, and
   anti-diet advocates are angry and emotional. But we aren’t angry at
   you.

   We aren’t attacking your personal diet or your personal experience.
   Because those are yours. You get to choose those things for yourself.

   We are angry at the culture that has told us that fitting a size is the
   only way to live your life, angry at the rigged system and the
   emotional toll for those who have been harmed by the attempts to help.
   And we will keep pushing for change.
