   The DOI^® System ISO 26324

                           Image showing DOI Uses

   This is the web site of the International DOI Foundation (IDF), a
   not-for-profit membership organization that is the governance and
   management body for the federation of Registration Agencies providing
   Digital Object Identifier (DOI) services and registration, and is the
   registration authority for the ISO standard (ISO 26324) for the DOI
   system. The DOI system provides a technical and social infrastructure
   for the registration and use of persistent interoperable identifiers,
   called DOIs, for use on digital networks.

   Clicking on a DOI link (try this one: https://doi.org/10.1109/5.771073)
    takes you to one or more current URLs or other services related to a
    single resource. If the URLs or services change over time, e.g., the
    resource moves, this same DOI will continue to resolve to the correct
                resources or services at their new locations.
