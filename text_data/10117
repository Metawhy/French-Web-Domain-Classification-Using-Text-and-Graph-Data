From the concert
       2019-06-04 @ GrandWest Grand Arena

Directed by
       Mountainside Sessions
       Rehearsal backstage with The Mighty Soweto Gospel Choir. Working
       with them feels like home and I’m looking forward to collaborating
       again.
       Film and Audio by: Mountainside Sessions
       Mountainside Sessions is devoted to the growth of South African
       music by providing live recording videos to local artists both
       known and unknown. They share local talent weekly in order to grow
       a platform where art is appreciated and the artists get the
       recognition they deserve. They were kind enough to come out and
       film for me and it was a pleasure working with them. Looking
       forward to doing more with them. Filmed by Dan Tucker and Josh
       Hundermark.
       Huge thanks to the fans in:
       Durban
       Pretoria
       Johannesburg
       Cape Town
       Mauritius
       Reunion Island
       Sal Masekela
