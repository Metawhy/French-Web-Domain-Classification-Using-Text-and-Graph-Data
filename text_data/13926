Jura Prophecy

   46% 70cl

   Heavily peated with fresh cinnamon and sea spray Matured without chill
   filtration for a huge peaty punch, this complex whisky is aged in

KILCHOMAN

   KILCHOMAN

   The first distillery built on the Isle of Islay for over a century,
   Kilchoman celebrated its third birthday in September 2009, with its new
   spirit finally reaching the age required for it to be legally called a
   single malt. Built using the model of a “farmhouse-distillery”,
   Kilchoman makes a point of distilling its new spirit from barley grown
   on its own land. Some 100 tonnes are harvested and malted at the
   distillery, providing 30% of their needs. The rest comes from the
   maltings at Port Ellen. Its first barrel of new make spirit was filled
   in 2005.

   Eilean Donan castle in Scotland

   Scotland accounts for the largest number of distilleries in the world.
   With over 97 operating malt distilleries, it offers a broad range of
   personalities and thoroughly unique flavours.
   The question of production regions arose in the early 1980s, when the
   range of single malts on offer increased significantly.
   Five main regions are commonly recognised - the Lowlands, Highlands,
   Speyside, Campbeltown, the islands and Islay - but this classification
   is not set in stone and only applies to malt distilleries.

The Lowlands

   Once the main whisky-producing region, the Lowlands have seen their
   number of distilleries rapidly decline, dropping from eight
   distilleries in 1980 to just two in 2000. The Bladnoch distillery
   located at the southern-most tip of the Lowlands recently reopened its
   doors, as did Aisla Bay, increasing the number of working distilleries
   to four.
   The whiskies of the Lowlands, Auchentoshan and Glenkinchie are renowned
   for the delicacy and freshness of their aromas, often characterised by
   herbaceous and floral notes.

The Highlands

   Scotland’s largest region, the Highlands stretch down to the south from
   Dundee to Campbeltown and all the way up to the northern town of
   Thurso. The twenty-six distilleries scattered from north to south and
   east to west, include some of the finest jewels of the whisky industry:
   Dalmore, Oban, Aberfeldy andGlenmorangie.
   Most Highland whiskies are characterised by notes of salt, broom,
   spices and sometimes peat, with each individual distillery and ageing
   process adding its own specific flavours.

Speyside

   The ‘golden triangle’ of whisky, Speyside stretches from the city of
   Inverness (West) to Keith (East), just south of the town of Grantown on
   Spey, and boasts the highest number of distilleries (forty-eight),
   including the famous Macallan, Glenfiddich, Glenlivet,and Aberlour.
   Speyside whiskies are known for their fruity notes (white-fleshed
   fruit, red berries) and their rounded, mellow character.

Campbeltown and the islands

   Located off the western coast of Scotland, the islands include Orkney
   (2 distilleries), Skye (1), Mull (1), Jura (1), Arran (1) and the
   Campbeltown peninsula (3). They have an inherently maritime character
   with vegetal (heather) and woody notes.
   Talisker is the only distillery on the Isle of Skye, and is
   characterised by a volcanic temperament, infused with smoky notes and
   spices (pepper).

The Isle of Islay

   Located off the south-western coast of Scotland, of all the islands
   Islay is the most exposed to high winds and storms. The island is
   probably home to Scotland’s highest number of distilleries per square
   metre.
   No less than seven distilleries have chosen to set up shop here:
   Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Bowmore, Caol Ila, Bunnahabhain and
   Bruichladdich, as well as Port Ellen, which closed in 1983, and a
   newcomer, Kilchoman, which opened in 2005.
   These malts are among the smokiest, earthiest and most iodised in
   Scotland.

Highlands

   This vast region extends to the north of a line from Greenock to Dundee
   and offers a wide variety of landscapes. The mountains (notably Ben
   Nevis and the Grampians) and valleys contrast dramatically with the
   lakes of Perth and Aberdeen. The whisky-producing Highlands can be
   divided into four sub-regions. The southern Highlands, with light,
   fruity single malts. The western Highlands with spicy, single malts
   tasting of the sea air, like Talisker from the isle of Skye, or more
   salty and smoky, like Oban and Ben Nevis.

Lowlands

   Stretching south from a line joining Greenock, to the north of Glasgow,
   to Dundee, in the county of Perth, this rugged region, with its jagged
   coastline benefits from a mild climate. It is characterised by rich,
   fertile agricultural land, suitable for cereal crops, especially barley
   and wheat. Served by two rivers, the Forth and the Clyde, it has all
   the resources necessary for distillation. Sometimes distilled three
   times, Lowlands whiskies are generally dry and light. They are also
   characterised by subtle floral and herbaceous notes. At the end of the
   last century there were over twenty active distilleries in the
   Lowlands. There are currently only two, Auchentoshan to the north of
   Glasgow and Glenkinchie east of Edinburgh, which is the only Lowlands
   distillery that is open to the public.
