Picture Yourself at Union
       Thrive at the intersections of scientific probing and artistic
       flair. Of intellectual curiosity and serious fun. Of an idyllic
       campus, and an urban setting.
       Since 1795, we've been challenging convention, blurring boundaries
       and shaking up traditional thinking.

UNION ALUMNI MAKING A DIFFERENCE

   A law career of service

   "Pro bono work is very important to me because it allows me to assist
   underserved individuals, organizations and communities that would not
   otherwise have access to legal representation."
   Carla Reeves '08

   Theater as therapy

   "Children with autism have difficulty reading nonverbal cues,
   communicating, and expressing emotions. Improv requires them to do all
   of these things. In addition, it is always safe."
   Rachel Magin '14

   Helping refugees

   “We are just scratching the surface of what’s possible in terms of how
   technology can be leveraged to help the most vulnerable live a safer,
   healthier, and more empowering life.”
   Mike Clarke ’11
