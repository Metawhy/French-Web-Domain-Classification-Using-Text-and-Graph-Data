Anna's Rapunzel Birthday Party

   Posted by Erin Eason
   My little girl is turning 4! (Actually this happened quite some time
   ago.  I'm only getting around to posting about it now!) ...and this
   year she has requested a Rapunzel party.  I could not have been any
   more excited.  I loved this movie and it was the first movie we had
   ever taken Anna to see in the theatre.  Now, I am not a fan of doing a
   party store birthday party.  I would rather not go to the party store
   and buy every matching themed item they have, throw it all up in the
   house and call it good.  I like to create one of a kind party pieces.
   I like a challenge.  So, here is what I came up with...

   First, we worked on some decorations.

   I made this door sign by cutting the Rapunzel sun out of foam core and
   then spraying it with gold glitter paint.  I attached a glittery purple
   4 and a purple ribbon and I had the perfect welcome to our Rapunzel
   party.

   This is the front walkway going up to our house.  I found some
   printable  Flynn Rider "wanted" posters online and printed off a
   bunch.  We put them on trees and anywhere else had space.
   You can print your own Flynn Rider 'Wanted' posters here.

   When each child entered the house, they received either a Rapunzel hair
   or a Viking helmet.  I made these Rapunzel hairs myself.  They were a
   lot more work than I thought they would be, but I think they were well
   worth it.

   Here is a great tutorial on how to make the Rapunzel hair.

    In the second picture you can see a different version of the Rapunzel
   hair.  We had a few ladies under 2 years old and I didn't want the
   really long Rapunzel hair being any kind of choking hazard or getting
   stuck around their necks.  Therefore, I made baby Rapunzel hair and
   attached them to dollar store yellow headbands.  This worked out great!

   The backyard was adorned with not only a bunch of Flynn Rider "Wanted"
   posters but this amazing Snuggly Duckling sign made by by my husband.
   I told him I thought we 'needed' one and voila! A perfect replica of
   the Snuggly Duckling sign!

   [IMG_0732.JPG]

   [IMG_0784.JPG]
   Here is our awesome magical glowing flower.  I bought a lily at the
   craft store and just painted it with gold craft paint.
   [IMG_0755.JPG]

   We also bought a bunch of flowers in the clearance section at the
   crafts store and put them wherever we could find room.  Rapunzel loves
   flowers...and apparently Pascal does too!

   [IMG_0783.JPG]

   The food was fun to do as well, but of course the cake was best of
   all!  Here are some photos of the Rapunzel tower cake.  It was almost
   3.5 feet tall and was an exact replica of the one in the movie.  If you
   want to know more about how I made this cake and see more pics, check
   out my blog post Best Rapunzel Tower Cake Ever!

   (...and can you see the cute banner I made at the top of the first cake
   pic.  It reads 'Best Day Ever'.)
   [IMG_0753.JPG]

   [IMG_0769.JPG]
   Aside from the cake, we also had Rapunzel paint brushes, or rice krispy
   treats dipped in colored candy melts and then put on a stick.
   [IMG_0756.JPG]

   [IMG_0757.JPG]

   Because there might not have been enough cake! ;)

     [IMG_0758.JPG]
   I also made these fancy water bottle labels. They read 'Anna's Best Day
   Ever'.

   [IMG_0786.JPG]

   [IMG_0789.JPG]

   [IMG_0790.JPG]
   We kept the activities simple.  We had a lot of little kids and
   families, so we opted to move away from traditional party games.  It
   worked out fine because it was a beautiful day and everyone wanted to
   spend most of their time hanging out and playing with their Rapunzel
   hair in the treehouse.
     [IMG_0890.JPG]
   Here is Penelope hanging out in her baby Rapunzel hair.
   [IMG_0814.JPG]
   We did plan one activity.  I bought a bunch of canvases and paint and
   each child was able to paint a canvas to take home with them.  I bought
   some pizza boxes at our local Cash n' Carry so that parents could take
   the painting home in their cars without having to worry about wet
   paint.
   [IMG_0800.JPG]
   Here is my sweet girl blowing out the candles.
   [IMG_0823.JPG]

   At the end of the party, each child received a Flynn Rider satchel
   (sewn by me) filled with all sorts of goodies. We included Rapunzel
   paints, a crown, a viking rubber duckie, princess crayons, a small
   chameleon, a ring pop, a necklace and a small mirror and comb.

     [IMG_0734.JPG]
   Everyone else got these cute Rapunzel inspired sugar cookies. I never
   do decorated cookies so I was pretty proud of how they turned out.
   [IMG_0739.JPG]




   The day after the party, I took my little Rapunzel to the park and took
   some birthday pictures of her.  I had her wear her new Rapunzel hair
   and this cute Rapunzel inspired apron skirt I made her for the party.

   Happy 4th Birthday to my sweet girl! Hope it was the Best. Day. Ever.

The Best Rapunzel Tower Cake

   Posted by Erin Eason
   My AWESOME husband surprised me for Mother's day with a 3-day intensive
   class with Mike McCarey over at Mike's Amazing Cakes in Redmond, WA.
   My Mother's Day present was a huge surprise and included the
   following...
   In Mike McCarey's 3-day Custom Class, a maximum of 5 students spend 3
   days receiving the ultimate in hands-on, personalized instruction from
   Mike and his talented staff.  Each student gets to create the project
   of their dreams from start to finish. Mike teaches the entire process
   from finding resource materials and creating patterns, to building your
   stand and then executing your cake to it's final finish. In addition,
   each student will watch and learn as Mike instructs the other student
   on their dream projects.  Possible project ideas were: cars, animals
   (standing or sitting), shoes, ball shapes, off-kilter tiers, boats,
   upside-down wedding cakes...
   For more information on this class you can check out the calendar on
   his website at www.mikesamazingcakes.com.
   So, what is my dream cake? I have no idea. I have a whole file on my
   computer filled with pictures of cake ideas I would like to make, but
   this is entirely different.  This cake has to be monumental,
   challenging...and large.  Mike is known for making over the
   top, enormously realistic, and to-scale replicas of....well, almost
   anything.  He asked me to send my top four ideas and with the help of
   the husband spent about 6 hours making my list.
   I finally figured that if this cake was going to be as awesome as I
   imagined it could be, that I should probably make something that I
   could replicate for an actual event where people could see it. My
   little lady's 4th birthday was only 5 months away ;), so why not make
   her the best birthday cake ever.  The researching of different Rapunzel
   cakes lead to the realization that there were very few awesome Rapunzel
   tower cakes.  Most were some version of frosted upside down ice cream
   cones on cupcakes or stunted versions where it may have been possible
   for Rapunzel to just climb out the window and make a small jump to safe
   ground.
   I sent Mike a picture of the tower as it appeared in the movie and when
   Mike called to talk about the specifics of the cake I couldn't have
   been more excited.  Mike explained that he wanted make a 3 1/2 foot
    tall exact replica of the tower.  The actual tower would be made of
   cake, while the top portion and Rapunzel's living space would be made
   entirely of chocolate.  The chocolate top of the tower would also be
   able to be removed from the bottom section of the tower so that it
   would be easy to transport and so that the top could be saved and
   admired for months after.
   When I got to Mike's Amazing Cakes, I found my new work station and met
   the three other students I would be sending the next three days with.
   The other students flew in from around the country (California, Las
   Vegas and Canada) to be there and each of the cakes we were going to be
   completing that weekend were entirely different.  We spent the morning
   reviewing the plans Mike had made and how to replicate them at home,
   talking about the internal structure, and getting to see all
   of the work our classmates would be doing.
   The it was time to get started. Here is what I found on my work table.
   Picture of idea board
   [IMG_1648.JPG]
   These are just a couple pictures of plans Mike gave me for the tower.
   All the plans were copied to scale, as were the patterns for the
   tower's many details.
   To learn more about how Mike makes his patterns and plans, check out
   his Craftsy class on Advanced Cake Sculpting here
   www.craftsy.com/class/advanced-cake-sculpting-bobblehead-cakes
   [IMG_1652.JPG]
   [IMG_1649.JPG]
   This is a picture of stands I used to create the Rapunzel tower.
   The stand on the left is a 'working' stand.  This is the stand that I
   used to work on the top portion of the tower.  You can see the
   Styrofoam round attached to the stand in this photo.  This stand's
   lower height made a more manageable working height.
   The stand on the right was the actual stand that the cake was attached
   and carved on.  When the tall tower of cake was carved, covered and
   finished, I removed the top of the tower from the 'working' stand and
   set it on the dowel attached to the actual cake stand.  Using the two
   stands also made transporting the cake easier.
   [photo%5B4%5D+(2).JPG]
   Here are pictures of the tower building process. The tower was made
   from a buttermilk based white cake and surprisingly had no internal
   structure beyond the middle pole. We did not use any cardboard rounds
   in between layers and the tower was more solid than I would have
   thought possible.
   [photo%5B1%5D.JPG]
   [photo%5B2%5D.JPG]
   [photo%5B3%5D.JPG]
   The process for the top of the tower was little more complicated.  The
   structure started with
   styrofoam rounds and then we covered them completely in modeling
   chocolate.  All of the details on the top tower were done in modeling
   chocolate.  With a little airbrushing and some buttercream piped ivy
   the cake was complete.  I couldn't have been more excited about the
   finished project.

   Best. Rapunzel. Cake. Ever.
   [photo%255B4%255D.JPG]
   Here are some photos of the cake once I got it home.
   [IMG_9185.JPG]
   [IMG_9186.JPG]
   [IMG_9187.JPG]
   I added these photos of Anna with her cake so that you can see how big
   the cake really was.  I don't think the pictures above truly do it
   justice.
   [IMG_9201.JPG]
   [IMG_9205.JPG]
    This one I added just because it is so sweet! Anna is looking for
   Rapunzel through the window.
   [IMG_9218.JPG]
   While I was there, Mike generously offered for me to come back to the
   shop to recreate the bottom portion of the tower a few months later for
   Anna's actual birthday party. Of course I said "YES"!
   Stay tuned for my next post detailing Anna's Rapunzel Party.

Koi Fish Cake

   Posted by Erin Eason
   While I was at Cake Love 2012, I also took a cake carving class with
   Mike Elder from Black Sheep Custom Cakes.  It was a great experience
   and I learned a lot of new techniques that I will definitely be trying
   again soon.  Here is the finished project.  I think this koi cake is
   pretty fancy.

Gumpaste Peony

   Posted by Erin Eason
   At Cake Love 2012, I took a flower class from Jacqueline Butler of
   Petalsweet Cakes.  For those of you that know me, I know...a flower
   class?  I love making cake and wish more often than not that I liked
   to, was patient enough or was good at making sugar flowers.  However,
   this class may have changed my mind.  My flower actually turned
   out pretty good.  I may have actually have the thought of making a
   whole army of these flowers, enough that I could cover a cake in them.
    What do you think?

Gumpaste Red High Heel Shoe

   Posted by Erin Eason
   This past October, I went to the Cake Love 2012 cake conference in
   Vancouver, BC with a bunch of my cake friends.  It was a great time and
   I got to take some fabulous classes by some awesome instructors.

   Here is my gumpaste red closed toe high heeled shoe I made in a class
   taught by Wayne Steinkopf   from Swank Cake Design.

   I can't wait to make another and actually put it on a cake.  Right now,
   this one hangs out on the shelf is my craft room.  I think it might be
   lonely!

Ade's First Birthday - A Jungle Cake

   Posted by Erin Eason
   I made this sweet first birthday cake for the sweetest little boy.  The
   jungle theme was really fun and gave me the opportunity to not only
   make some awesome gumpaste figures but extend the theme by adding
   animal print to the cake rounds.  Happy Birthday Ade!

The Pickle Cake

   Posted by Erin Eason
   A friend of mine came to me and explained that her daughter was turning
   9 and had requested a pickle birthday  party.  At this pickle party,
   they were going to eat all kinds of pickles, can their own pickles, and
   play a bunch of different pickle inspired games.  I love a good themed
   birthday party probably more than most people, so when she asked if I
   could come up with a pickle cake I was happy to help her out.

   My friend gave me complete creative license with the design of this
   cake. The only requests were that it needed to feed 12 people and that
   they would like it to be made from chocolate cake.  In the planning
   process for this cake, I decided that I would try to make the pickle as
   realistic as possible and then quickly realized that this plan would
   either turn out great or turn out very, very badly. There was a
   definite possibility that the cake could turn out as awesome as I
   imagine it could be in my head or it could turn out to look like a big,
   green, unappealing blob of a cake. Oh geez!

   I went to work baking, carving, covering and worrying...and then I
   decided that maybe the key to a fabulous pickle cake would be in it's
   color, or rather it's range of color, depth and realism.  So, I got out
   my rarely used airbrush.  I rarely used it because I am mostly afraid
   of it.  I have not used it very many time and know that once you
   airbrush a cake you can't got back, you can't remove it and it is
   extremely hard to remedy without starting over completely.  But, I went
   for it anyways and I am now in awe of the airbrush's awesome
   abilities.  Starting with a very light avocado green colored base I
   layered shade of green, yellow and warm brown to achieve almost exactly
   what I had imagined.  I love it!

   When I delivered this pickle, the birthday girl was not only surprised
   by how real it looked but also by it's size. You can't tell from the
   picture, but i grossly over-estimated the amount of cake I would need
   and this cake was huge.  I could easily fed 40 people.

   So, three cheers for a super huge pickle cake.  I'm sure it tasted
   better than it looked (because that is a lot of pickle).



   [IMG_1184.JPG]


   ***Another funny pickle cake story:

   I saw my friend who ordered the pickle cake the week following the
   party and she had great things to say about the cake.  She then went on
   to tell me that since she didn't actually get to have a piece of cake
   at the party (and since there was so much left over) she decided to
   have a piece after dinner that night,  When she took a bite of the
   cake, she was surprised to find that the chocolate cake not only have a
   slight pickle flavor but was a tad crunchy.  Needless to say, she did
   finish her piece but still wondered if I had intended for the flavor of
   the cake to include the cake's theme as well.  The next day, after a
   little super sleuthing, she came to find out that her 4 year old son
   had come by some of the sprigs of dill that were left over from the
   party's pickle canning activity and had decided to place the sprigs
   inside the holes the candles had made in the top of the leftover cake.
   So, there was at least one piece of cake that actually tasted like a
   pickle.  Too funny!
