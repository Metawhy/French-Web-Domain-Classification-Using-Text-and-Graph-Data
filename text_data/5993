Roar Bible Crafts

   Posted on October 1, 2019

   These are the crafts that can be used with the Group’s Roar V.B.S.
   program.

   Although most Vacation Bible School curriculum programs provide or sell
   their own Bible crafts, many times they have nothing to do with the
   Bible story of the day or not much thought went into designing them in
   the first place.

   My hope is that these crafts will help make planning your Vacation
   Bible School a little less stressful.
