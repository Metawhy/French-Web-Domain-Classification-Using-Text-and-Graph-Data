   Well took the time this evening to make sure all the furnace vents were
   clean and clear, checked the filter and belt, and switched on the
   furnace for the first time this season. Took out the digital
   thermometer to show the wifey it was working… she replied, “Um yeah, I
   think its working if the kitchen is 119 degrees”. LoL!

   Classic great film, Thirteen Ghost (2001) There are ghosts around us
   all the time. Most of them, they can’t hurt us, most of them don’t even
   want to hurt us. A little ghost here, a little ghost there, no one
   cares. But there are exceptions. The ones who die all violent deaths
   stay in the tortured realm and so violence is all they know.

   Well took the time this evening to make sure all the furnace vents were
   clean and clear, checked the filter and belt, and switched on the
   furnace for the first time this season. Took out the digital
   thermometer to show the wifey it was working… she replied, “Um yeah, I
   think its working if the kitchen is 119 degrees”. LoL!

   Classic great film, Thirteen Ghost (2001) There are ghosts around us
   all the time. Most of them, they can’t hurt us, most of them don’t even
   want to hurt us. A little ghost here, a little ghost there, no one
   cares. But there are exceptions. The ones who die all violent deaths
   stay in the tortured realm and so violence is all they know.

   Well took the time this evening to make sure all the furnace vents were
   clean and clear, checked the filter and belt, and switched on the
   furnace for the first time this season. Took out the digital
   thermometer to show the wifey it was working… she replied, “Um yeah, I
   think its working if the kitchen is 119 degrees”. LoL!

   Classic great film, Thirteen Ghost (2001) There are ghosts around us
   all the time. Most of them, they can’t hurt us, most of them don’t even
   want to hurt us. A little ghost here, a little ghost there, no one
   cares. But there are exceptions. The ones who die all violent deaths
   stay in the tortured realm and so violence is all they know.

   Well took the time this evening to make sure all the furnace vents were
   clean and clear, checked the filter and belt, and switched on the
   furnace for the first time this season. Took out the digital

   think its working if the kitchen is 119 degrees”. LoL!

   Classic great film, Thirteen Ghost (2001) There are ghosts around us
   all the time. Most of them, they can’t hurt us, most of them don’t even
   want to hurt us. A little ghost here, a little ghost there, no one
   cares. But there are exceptions. The ones who die all violent deaths
   stay in the tortured realm and so violence is all they know.

The wifey has been wanting a Alexa or smart speaker for an anniversary gift…
well today while at a Goodwill I happened across a iLive Performance
Concierge speaker, basically a Alexa smart enabled speaker, for $3.00!! Works
perfect and we had a cord that works with it for charging. She loves it and
has been playing trivia and word games with it all evening! I love being able
to get her something she wants and even more so when it’s a awesome bargain
price!
