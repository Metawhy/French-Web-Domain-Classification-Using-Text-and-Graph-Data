Further information on data protection

1. Automatic storage of access data

   Each time you access AdDefend GmbH’s website, the access data for the
   transaction is automatically saved in a log file. This concerns general
   information such as the page from which the file was requested, the
   name of the retrieved file, the date and time of the request, the
   amount of data transferred, the protocol used and the own descriptions
   sent by the Internet browser and possibly the operating system.
   This general information will be anonymised, so it will not be stored
   together with your personal data that may be available at the AdDefend
   GmbH and will not be merged with it in any other way. They are only
   evaluated for statistical purposes and used to improve the content and
   functionality of the website. There shall be no transfer of this data
   to third parties for other non-commercial or commercial purposes. The
   access data in the log file are stored for a maximum of 4 weeks.

2. Cookies

   This website also uses cookies. A cookie is a text file with an
   identification number that is transmitted to and deposited on the
   user’s computer when you use the website, together with the other data
   actually requested. The file is kept there for later access and is used
   to authenticate the user.
   Since cookies are just simple files and not executable programs, they
   pose no threat to your computer. Cookies do not contain any personally
   identifiable information, so that the protection of your privacy is
   guaranteed. Your Internet browser accepts cookies automatically if you
   have chosen this setting for your browser. This setting can be changed
   and the storage of cookies disabled or set so that you are notified
   when a cookie is deposited. However, if you should choose to deactivate
   the use of cookies, some functions of the website may not be available
   or only available to a limited extent.

3. Mailings (by post and by e-mail)

   If you have subscribed to the AdDefend GmbH agency group’s mailings,
   AdDefend GmbH will process the personal information that you have
   provided us with to inform you of news from the agency group.
   You agree that a regular dispatch of newsletters by e-mail or post may
   be made to the contact details you have provided (postal address,
   e-mail address). Before the e-mail newsletter is sent out, it will be
   verified beforehand that you are the owner of the specified e-mail
   address or that the owner agrees to receive the newsletter.
   To manage the address data and to send the newsletter, AdDefend GmbH
   uses a data processing company. The service provider has access only to
   the personal information needed to fulfil the contract. Your address
   data are not used by the service provider or by AdDefend GmbH itself
   for other purposes. AdDefend GmbH concludes a corresponding data
   processing contract with the service provider, which meets the
   requirements of Art. 28, 29 GDPR.
   You can informally object to this processing at any time both by post
   to info@addefend.de .

4. Use of the analytics tool “Google Analytics”

   AdDefend GmbH uses the service Google Analytics of Google LLC, 1600
   Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. This service allows
   an analysis of the use of this website and uses cookies for this
   purpose. For this purpose, the information generated by the cookie on
   behalf of AdDefend GmbH, such as your anonymised IP address, is
   transmitted to a server of Google LLC in the USA, where it is stored
   and evaluated. Because on this website, Google Analytics has been
   extended by the code “gat. _anonymizeIp ();”. This ensures an anonymous
   collection of IP addresses. The anonymisation of your IP address is
   usually done by Google LLC shortening your IP address within the
   European Union or other contracting states of the European Economic
   Area (EEA). In exceptional cases, your IP address will be transmitted
   to servers in the US and only abbreviated once there. Your IP address
   will not be merged with other data from Google LLC.
   The Google Analytics Advertising feature uses remarketing and
   demographics and interests reporting. The purpose of these procedures
   is using the user behaviour information to align advertising measures
   more closely to the interests of the respective user. Based on your
   surfing behaviour, our website can display personalised advertising on
   other websites as part of remarketing. The advertising media may
   contain products that you previously viewed on the our website. If
   you’ve consented to Google linking your web and app browsing history to
   your Google Account and using information from your Google Account to
   personalise your ads, Google will use that information for cross-device
   remarketing. You may object to the collection of your data through
   Google Analytics at any time. The following options are available:
   Most browsers accept cookies automatically. You can prevent the use of
   cookies by setting your browser accordingly; however, if you do so, you
   may not be able to make use of all the functions of the website. The
   settings must be done separately for each browser that is used.
   You may also prevent Google LLC from collecting and processing this
   information by downloading and installing the browser add-on available
   from the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de
   Alternatively, or within browsers on mobile devices, click on the
   following link: Deactivate Google Analytics An opt-out cookie will be
   stored on the AdDefend GmbH user device for AdDefend GmbH web pages
   with effect for the currently used browser. If the cookies are deleted
   in this browser, this link must be clicked again.
   For more information about terms of use and data protection, please
   visit http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html or
   https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/.

5. Use of Google remarketing for interest-based advertising

   Google’s remarketing technology will redirect users who have already
   visited our websites to the Google Partner Network pages through
   interest-based advertising. With the help of cookies, interests can be
   analysed when you visit the website and then used for relevant product
   advertising.
   If users have consented to Google linking their web and app browsing
   history to their Google account, and using information from AdDefend
   GmbH’s Google account to personalise ads they see on the web, Google
   will use that logged-in user’s data along with Google Analytics data to
   create and define audience lists for cross-device remarketing. Google
   Analytics will track Google-authenticated IDs of these users to support
   this feature. Google’s personal information is temporarily linked to
   AdDefend GmbH’s Google Analytics data to build audiences.
