Executive Summary

   AI is a prediction technology. Its improvement is akin to turning up
   the volume knob on a speaker dial. But rather than volume, you’re
   turning up the AI’s prediction accuracy. What happens to Amazon’s
   strategy as their data scientists, engineers, and machine learning
   experts work tirelessly to dial up the accuracy on the prediction
   machine? In this example, it shifts Amazon’s business model from
   shopping-then-shipping to shipping-then-shopping, generates the
   incentive to vertically integrate into operating a product-returns
   service (including a fleet of trucks), and accelerates the timing of
   investment due to first-mover advantage from increasing returns. All
   this is due to the single act of turning the dial on the prediction
   machine.

   How will AI change strategy? That’s the single most common question the
   three of us are asked from corporate executives, and it’s not trivial
   to answer. AI is fundamentally a prediction technology. As advances in
   AI make prediction cheaper, economic theory dictates that we’ll use
   prediction more frequently and widely, and the value of complements to
   prediction – like human judgment – will rise. But what does all this
   mean for strategy?

   Here’s a thought experiment we’ve been using to answer that question.
   Most people are familiar with shopping at Amazon.  Like with most
   online retailers, you visit their website, shop for items, place them
   in your “basket,” pay for them, and then Amazon ships them to you.
   Right now, Amazon’s business model is shopping-then-shipping.

   Most shoppers have noticed Amazon’s recommendation engine while they
   shop — it offers suggestions of items that their AI predicts you will
   want to buy. At present, Amazon’s AI does a reasonable job, considering
   the millions of items on offer. However, they are far from perfect. In
   our case, the AI accurately predicts what we want to buy about 5% of
   the time. In other words, we actually purchase about one out of
   every 20 items it recommends. Not bad!

   Now for the thought experiment. Imagine the Amazon AI collects more
   information about us: in addition to our searching and purchasing
   behavior on their website, it also collects other data it finds online,
   including social media, as well as offline, such as our shopping
   behavior at Whole Foods. It knows not only what we buy, but also what
   time we go to the store, which location we shop at, how we pay, and
   more.

   Now, imagine the AI uses that data to improve its predictions. We think
   of this sort of improvement as akin to turning up the volume knob on a
   speaker dial. But rather than volume, you’re turning up the AI’s
   prediction accuracy. What happens to Amazon’s strategy as their data
   scientists, engineers, and machine learning experts work tirelessly to
   dial up the accuracy on the prediction machine?

   At some point, as they turn the knob, the AI’s prediction accuracy
   crosses a threshold, such that it becomes in Amazon’s interest to
   change its business model. The prediction becomes sufficiently accurate
   that it becomes more profitable for Amazon to ship you the goods that
   it predicts you will want rather than wait for you to order them. Every
   week, Amazon ships you boxes of items it predicts you will want, and
   then you shop in the comfort and convenience of your own home by
   choosing the items you wish to keep from the boxes they delivered.

   This approach offers two benefits to Amazon. First, the convenience of
   predictive shipping makes it much less likely that you purchase the
   items from a competing retailer as the products are conveniently
   delivered to your home before you buy them elsewhere. Second,
   predictive shipping nudges you to buy items that you were considering
   purchasing but might not have gotten around to. In both cases, Amazon
   gains a higher share-of-wallet. Turning the prediction dial up far
   enough changes Amazon’s business model from shopping-then-shipping to
   shipping-then-shopping.

   Of course, shoppers would not want to deal with the hassle of returning
   all the items they don’t want.  So, Amazon would invest in
   infrastructure for the product returns — perhaps a fleet of
   delivery-style trucks that do pick-ups once a week, conveniently
   collecting items that customers don’t want.

   If this is a better business model, then why hasn’t Amazon done it
   already? Well, they may be working on it. But if it were implemented
   today, the cost of collecting and handling returned items would
   outweigh the increase in revenue from a greater share-of-wallet. For
   example, today we would return 95% of the items it ships to us. That is
   annoying for us and costly for Amazon. The prediction isn’t good enough
   for Amazon to adopt the new model.

   That said, one can imagine a scenario where Amazon adopts the new
   strategy even before the prediction accuracy is good enough to make it
   profitable because the company anticipates that at some point it will
   be profitable. By launching sooner, Amazon’s AI will get more data
   sooner, and improve faster. Amazon realizes that the sooner it gets
   started, the harder it will be for competitors to catch up. Better
   predictions will attract more shoppers, more shoppers will generate
   more data to train the AI, more data will lead to better predictions,
   and so on, creating a virtuous circle. In other words, there are
   increasing returns to AI, and thus the timing of adopting this kind of
   strategy matters. Adopting too early could be costly, but adopting too
   late could be fatal.

   The key insight here is that turning the dial on the prediction machine
   has a significant impact on strategy. In this example, it shifts
   Amazon’s business model from shopping-then-shipping to
   shipping-then-shopping, generates the incentive to vertically integrate
   into operating a product-returns service (including a fleet of trucks),
   and accelerates the timing of investment due to first-mover advantage
   from increasing returns. All this is due to the single act of turning
   the dial on the prediction machine.

   Most readers will be familiar with the outcome of companies like
   Blockbuster and Borders that underestimated how quickly the online
   consumer behavior dial would turn in the context of online shopping and
   the digital distribution of goods and services. Perhaps they were
   lulled into complacency by the initially slow adoption rate of this
   technology in the early days of the commercial internet (1995-1998).

   Today, in the case of AI, some companies are making early bets
   anticipating that the dial on the prediction machine will start turning
   faster once it gains momentum. Most people are familiar with Google’s
   2014 acquisition of DeepMind – over $500M for a company that had
   generated negligible revenue, but had developed an AI that learned to
   play certain Atari games at a super human performance level. Perhaps
   fewer readers are aware that more traditional companies are also making
   bets on the pace the dial will turn. In 2016, GM paid over $1B to
   acquire AI startup Cruise Automation, and in 2017, Ford invested $1B in
   AI startup Argo AI, and John Deere paid over $300M to acquire AI
   startup Blue River Technology – all three startups had generated
   negligible revenue relative to the price at the time of purchase. GM,
   Ford, and John Deere are each betting on an exponential speed up of AI
   performance and, at those prices, anticipating a significant impact on
   their business strategies.

   Strategists face two questions in light of all of this. First, they
   must invest in developing a better understanding of how fast and how
   far the dial on their prediction machines will turn for their sector
   and applications. Second, they must invest in developing a thesis about
   the strategy options created by the shifting economics of their
   business that result from turning the dial, similar to the thought
   experiment we considered for Amazon.

   So, the overarching theme for initiating an AI strategy? Close your
   eyes, imagine putting your fingers on the dial of your prediction
   machine, and, in the immortal words of Spinal Tap, turn it to eleven.

   The ideas here are adapted from our forthcoming book “Prediction
   Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence.” (Harvard
   Business School Press, April 2018)

Executive Summary

   When a company connects with customers’ emotions, the payoff can be
   huge. Yet building such connections is often more guesswork than
   science. To remedy that problem, the authors have created a lexicon of
   nearly 300 “emotional motivators” and, using big data analytics, have
   linked them to specific profitable behaviors. They describe how firms
   can identify and leverage the particular motivators that will maximize
   their competitive advantage and growth. The process can be divided into
   three phases. First, companies should inventory their existing market
   research and customer insight data, looking for qualitative
   descriptions of what motivates their customers—desires for freedom,
   security, success, and so on. Further research can add to their
   understanding of those motivators. Second, companies should analyze
   their best customers to learn which of the motivators just identified
   are specific or more important to the high-value group. They should
   then find the two or three of these key motivators that have a strong
   association with their brand. This provides a guide to the emotions
   they need to connect with in order to grow their most valuable customer
   segment. Third, companies need to make the organization’s commitment to
   emotional connection a key lever for growth—not just in the marketing
   department but across every function in the firm.

Idea in Brief

   The Problem
   Companies know that emotions drive customer behavior, but most have
   little idea how to connect in ways that motivate the desired behaviors.
   The process is more guesswork than science.

   The Solution
   The authors have created a lexicon of “emotional motivators” and, using
   big data analytics, have linked them to specific profitable behaviors.

   The Opportunity
   By identifying the most powerful emotional motivators for a given
   customer segment, companies can design marketing and other strategies
   to leverage those motivators, giving them a new source of competitive
   advantage and growth.

   When companies connect with customers’ emotions, the payoff can be
   huge. Consider these examples: After a major bank introduced a credit
   card for Millennials that was designed to inspire emotional connection,
   use among the segment increased by 70% and new account growth rose by
   40%. Within a year of launching products and messaging to maximize
   emotional connection, a leading household cleaner turned market share
   losses into double-digit growth. And when a nationwide apparel retailer
   reoriented its merchandising and customer experience to its most
   emotionally connected customer segments, same-store sales growth
   accelerated more than threefold.

   Given the enormous opportunity to create new value, companies should
   pursue emotional connections as a science—and a strategy. But for most,
   building these connections is more guesswork than science. At the end
   of the day they have little idea what really works and whether their
   efforts have produced the desired results.

   Our research across hundreds of brands in dozens of categories shows
   that it’s possible to rigorously measure and strategically target the
   feelings that drive customers’ behavior. We call them “emotional
   motivators.” They provide a better gauge of customers’ future value to
   a firm than any other metric, including brand awareness and customer
   satisfaction, and can be an important new source of growth and
   profitability.

   At the most basic level, any company can begin a structured process of
   learning about its customers’ emotional motivators and conducting
   experiments to leverage them, later scaling up from there. At the other
   end of the spectrum, firms can invest in deep research and big data
   analytics or engage consultancies with specific expertise. Companies in
   financial services, retail, health care, and technology are now using a
   detailed understanding of emotional connection to attract and retain
   the most valuable customers. The most sophisticated firms are making
   emotional connection part of a broad strategy that involves every
   function in the value chain, from product development and marketing to
   sales and service.

High-Impact Motivators

   Hundreds of “emotional motivators” drive consumer behavior. Below are
   10 that significantly affect customer value across all categories
   studied.

   IFRAME: /resources/html/infographics/2015/11/Magids-table/index.html

   In what follows we’ll describe our research and our work with
   companies—to our knowledge, the first to show direct, robust links
   among specific emotional motivators, a firm’s actions to leverage them,
   consumer behavior, and business outcomes.

Defining Emotional Motivators

   Our research stemmed from our frustration that companies we worked with
   knew customers’ emotions were important but couldn’t figure out a
   consistent way to define them, connect with them, and link them to
   results. We soon discovered that there was no standard lexicon of
   emotions, and so eight years ago we set out to create one, working with
   experts and surveying anthropological and social science research. We
   ultimately assembled a list of more than 300 emotional motivators. We
   consider customers to be emotionally connected with a brand when it
   aligns with their motivations and helps them fulfill deep, often
   unconscious, desires. Important emotional motivators include desires to
   “stand out from the crowd,” “have confidence in the future,” and “enjoy
   a sense of well-being,” to name just a few.

   Identifying and measuring emotional motivators is complicated, because
   customers themselves may not even be aware of them. These sentiments
   are typically different from what customers say are the reasons they
   make brand choices and from the terms they use to describe their
   emotional responses to particular brands. What’s more, as we’ll
   discuss, emotional connections with products are neither uniform nor
   constant; they vary by industry, brand, touchpoint, and the customer’s
   position in the decision journey.

Why Emotional Connections Matter

   Although brands may be liked or trusted, most fail to align themselves
   with the emotions that drive their customers’ most profitable
   behaviors. Some brands by nature have an easier time making such
   connections, but a company doesn’t have to be born with the emotional
   DNA of Disney or Apple to succeed. Even a cleaning product or a canned
   food can forge powerful connections.

Getting Started

   Identifying and leveraging customers’ emotional motivators can be
   broken into three phases.

   First, inventory your existing market research and customer insight
   data. You will probably find qualitative descriptions of your
   customers’ motivating emotions, such as what aspects of life they value
   most (family, community, freedom, security) and what they aspire to
   day-to-day and in the future. From there, pursue research to add detail
   to your understanding of those emotions. Define a set of emotional
   motivators to probe—the list in the exhibit “High-Impact Motivators”
   will provide ideas, as will your qualitative research. Online surveys
   can help you quantify the relevance of individual motivators. Are your
   customers more driven by life in the moment or by future goals? Do they
   place greater value on social acceptance or on individuality? Don’t
   assume you know what motivates customers just because you know who they
   are. Young parents may be motivated by a desire to provide security for
   their families—or by an urge to escape and have some fun (you will
   probably find both types in your customer base). And don’t undermine
   your understanding of customers’ emotions by focusing on how people
   feel about your brand or how they say it makes them feel. You need to
   understand their underlying motivations separate from your brand.

   Second, analyze your best customers—those who buy and advocate the
   most, are the least price-sensitive, and are the most loyal. To do
   this, identify those who are highly satisfied with your brand—whatever
   the degree of their emotional connection—and divide them into quartiles
   according to annual purchases, advocacy, and so on. Examine the top
   quartile to see how the characteristics and behavior of your best
   customers differ from those of people in the other quartiles. Look at
   demographics, whether people buy in person or online, how much they buy
   from your competitors, and where they get their information about your
   brand (traditional media, social networks, and so on). Compare the
   emotional motivators of your best customers with the ones you’ve
   researched for your overall customer base and see which are specific or
   more important to the high-value group. Find the two or three of these
   key motivators that have a strong association with your brand. They
   will serve as an initial guide to the emotions you need to connect with
   in order to grow the most valuable customer segment of your business
   and to the marketing strategies and customer experience tactics that
   will provide the greatest connection opportunities.

   Third, make the organization’s commitment to emotional connection a key
   lever for growth. Use the language of emotional connection when you
   talk about your customers—not just in the marketing department but
   across the firm. In our experience, successful strategies based on
   emotional connection require buy-in from the top and must be embraced
   across functions. For example, if people in product development are
   working on a version that’s easier to use, they shouldn’t just ask
   whether customers will be satisfied with it; they should learn which
   emotional motivators it resonates with and how it will strengthen
   emotional connections.

   The process, in brief, looks like this: Applying big data analytics to
   detailed customer-data sets, we first identify the emotional motivators
   for a category’s most valuable customers. High-value automobile
   customers, for example, might want to “feel a sense of belonging” and
   “feel a sense of freedom.” Next we use statistical modeling to look at
   a large number of customers and brands, comparing survey results about
   people’s emotional motivators with their purchase behavior and
   identifying spikes in buying that are associated with specific
   motivators. This reveals which motivators generate the most-profitable
   customer behaviors in the category. We then quantify the current and
   potential value of motivators for a given brand and help identify
   strategies to leverage them.

   The model also allows us to compare the value of making strong
   emotional connections with that of scoring well on standard customer
   metrics such as satisfaction and brand differentiation, thus
   highlighting the potential gains from looking beyond traditional
   measures. We find that customers become more valuable at each step of a
   predictable “emotional connection pathway” as they transition from (1)
   being unconnected to (2) being highly satisfied to (3) perceiving brand
   differentiation to (4) being fully connected.

   Although customers exhibit increasing connection at each step, their
   value increases dramatically when they reach the fourth step: Fully
   connected customers are 52% more valuable, on average, than those who
   are just highly satisfied. In fact, their relative value is striking
   across a variety of metrics, such as purchases and frequency of use.

   R1511C_VALUEEMOTIONALCONNECTION

   The pathway is an important guide to where companies should invest—and
   it reveals that they often invest in the wrong places. To increase
   revenue and market share, many companies focus on turning dissatisfied
   customers into satisfied ones. However, our analysis shows that moving
   customers from highly satisfied to fully connected can have three times
   the return of moving them from unconnected to highly satisfied. And the
   highest returns we’ve seen have come from focusing on customers who are
   already fully connected to the category—from maximizing their value and
   attracting more of them to your brand.

   Four insights from our research are especially relevant to firms
   looking to build on emotional connection.

Emotional motivators vary by category and brand.

   Of the 300-plus motivators we’ve identified, 25 significantly affect
   customer value across all the categories we’ve analyzed. Anywhere from
   five to 15 additional motivators are important in any given category.
   For example, the sense that a home furnishings store “helps me be
   creative” inspires consumers to shop there more often. The wish to
   “feel revived and refreshed” drives loyalty to fast-food restaurants.
   Emotional motivators also vary within categories, depending on the
   desires of brands’ most valuable customers. Because brands differ in
   how well they align with their customers’ motivators, each may have a
   different starting point in any effort to strengthen emotional
   connections—and that point won’t necessarily relate to conventional
   measures of brand perception.

Emotional motivators vary across customer segments.

   Recall the credit card designed with Millennials in mind. Our model
   uncovered desires to “protect the environment” and “be the person I
   want to be” as key motivators in the banking category for that age
   group. (Traditional industry motivators such as desires to “feel
   secure” and to “succeed in life” are more typical of older groups.) The
   bank crafted messaging and features to connect to those sentiments,
   leading to its fastest-growing new credit card.

Emotional motivators for a given brand or industry vary with a person’s
position in the customer journey.

   In banking, the desire to “feel secure” is a critical motivator when
   attracting and retaining customers early on. When cross-selling
   products later, the wish to “succeed in life” becomes more important.
   To maximize results, companies must align their emotional-connection
   strategies with their specific customer-engagement
   objectives—acquisition, retention, cross-selling, and so on.

Emotional-connection-driven growth opportunities exist across the customer
experience, not just in traditional brand positioning and advertising.

   For example, social media can have a big impact on emotional
   connection. One condiments brand found that 60% of its
   social-network-affiliated customers (especially followers on Facebook,
   Twitter, and Pinterest)—versus 21% of all customers—were emotionally
   connected. It accelerated growth in a matter of months by increasing
   its focus on its social media network, developing its online customer
   community, and pointing customers to the website for recipes and
   promotions.

Putting Emotional Connections to Work

   Let’s look at how an emotional-connection strategy paid off for a
   national fashion retailer. The company was struggling with common
   industry challenges. Although it had a well-known brand and a strong
   market presence, same-store sales were stagnating, and promotional
   pricing was shrinking margins. So it focused on cost management,
   logistical efficiency, and streamlining the merchandise and store
   mix—with limited success. Over the past two years we worked with the
   retailer on a four-part strategy to identify, understand, and quantify
   the value of the most emotionally connected customers. This exposed
   large, unexploited opportunities and allowed the retailer to better
   direct investments across the firm.

1. Target connected customers.

   We set out to answer two basic questions: How valuable were the
   retailer’s fully connected customers, and could the company attract
   more of them? We used statistical techniques to measure the strength of
   customers’ emotional connections with the retailer and with its
   competitors. The process began with surveys to discern how consumers
   related to key motivators in the category and with analysis to see
   which motivators best predicted purchase behavior. We then modeled the
   financial impact of building emotional connections with customers at
   each step on the pathway from unconnected to fully connected.

   Our analysis showed that although fully connected customers constituted
   just 22% of customers in the category, they accounted for 37% of
   revenue and they spent, on average, twice as much annually ($400) as
   highly satisfied customers. Enhancing emotional connection could be a
   viable growth strategy if the retailer could attract fully connected
   customers from competitors, transform satisfied customers into fully
   connected ones, or both.

   Further segmentation revealed a group of especially valuable customers.
   We labeled them Fashion Flourishers, because apparel connects to their
   deep desire for excitement, social acceptance, and self-expression. As
   a group, Flourishers are the most emotionally connected segment by far;
   half are already fully connected to the category. Comparing the ratios
   of various emotion-based segments’ spending to those segments’ size
   highlights extraordinary differences in value: Flourishers have a ratio
   of 1.9—nearly twice the market average and more than nine times that of
   the least-connected group (whom we called Can’t Please Them, and whose
   ratio is just 0.2). Given the relatively fixed cost structure of
   retailing, acquiring and retaining Flourishers represented an
   opportunity to boost revenue and margins.

   A detailed profile of Flourishers underscored their attractiveness and
   exposed ways for the retailer to target them. Customers in this
   segment:
     * have a high lifetime value, spending an average of $468 a year in
       the category, versus $235 for other customers.
     * shop more often and advocate more: Fully 46% of Flourishers shop
       key fashion categories at least monthly, versus 21% of all
       shoppers. Flourishers are 1.4 times as likely as other customers to
       recommend retailers to their friends and family members.
     * are less price-sensitive: They are 2.3 times as likely as other
       customers to say they are “willing to pay more for the best fashion
       products,” 1.7 times less likely to make fashion purchase decisions
       solely on the basis of price, and 1.3 times less likely to shop for
       the lowest prices.
     * are predominantly female and younger, more ethnically diverse, and
       more likely to live in urban centers than other customers.
     * are more digitally engaged than other segments: They are 2.3 times
       as likely to research a fashion retailer online, 2.9 times as
       likely to shop for fashion products through their mobile devices,
       and 3.7 times as likely to follow a retailer on social media.

   Drawing on these and other insights, the retailer created a blueprint
   for pursuing the most valuable customer opportunities. By applying the
   category segmentation scheme to the more than 25 million people in its
   customer database, it determined the financial value and behaviors of
   its own Flourishers, confirming that they spent substantially more than
   other customers and had the highest lifetime value and the lowest
   attrition and price sensitivity of any segment. It estimated that
   moving satisfied Flourishers up the pathway to full emotional
   connection could increase annual sales by 3% to 5%, and that luring
   Flourishers away from competitors could increase revenue by 5% to 8%.
   Because members of this group spend more per capita than other
   customers and turn over less often, the analysis also predicted
   improvements in operating margins and returns on capital.

2. Quantify key motivators.

   Next, by analyzing tens of thousands of Flourishers across the
   category, we quantified the impact of more than 40 motivators on the
   group’s purchasing, spending, loyalty, and advocacy. We identified the
   most important category motivators—the ones that bore the strongest
   relationship to purchases—and assessed the retailer’s competitive
   position in each. The financial analysis and modeling showed that
   further investments to strengthen the customer experience around the
   desires to “feel a sense of belonging,” “feel a sense of thrill,” and
   “feel a sense of freedom”—the motivators driving category purchase
   behavior and for which the retailer already had the strongest
   position—were likely to yield the highest ROI. Those motivators
   therefore became the focus of specific customer-experience investments.

3. Optimize investments across functions.

   To maximize opportunities from emotional connection, companies must
   look beyond the marketing department. The retailer examined every
   function and customer touchpoint to find ways to enhance high-ROI
   emotional motivators. This brought four major investment areas into
   focus: stores, online and omnichannel experiences, merchandising, and
   message targeting.

Stores.

   To estimate which of the retailer’s more than 700 stores had the most
   Flourisher customers, we scored each one according to the presence of
   this segment in the store’s trading area. We found that high-scoring
   stores generated up to 25% more revenue than others. Their same-store
   sales were growing twice as quickly, and their operating profit was 30%
   greater. Their profit margins were enhanced by 10% higher inventory
   turns and—consistent with expectations—by lower coupon usage.
   (Flourishers don’t just say they’re willing to pay more—they actually
   do pay more.)

   These analytics changed the retailer’s store location strategy. We
   mapped the concentrations of Flourishers in all U.S. markets and
   submarkets, along with the segment’s propensities to shop at more than
   150 other retailers. The company’s real estate team now uses a
   predictive model to identify sites near Flourishers and also near other
   retailers they frequent.

   The change is paying off. New stores in trading areas with high
   concentrations of Flourishers have first-year sales that are 20% higher
   than historical averages, leading to faster break-even times and higher
   returns on capital. Further analysis has revealed opportunities to open
   hundreds of stores catering to underserved Flourisher populations. To
   free up capital for new stores, the retailer is closing ones in
   low-Flourisher areas.

   Emotional-connection analytics have also allowed the retailer to
   understand which aspects of the in-store shopping experience are most
   important to Flourishers. Because those qualities often aren’t
   recognized by customers themselves, they had not informed store design.
   Flourishers say it’s important that sales associates are easy to find,
   that clearance items are easy to locate, and that stores have free
   Wi-Fi. However, analysis showed that those aren’t actually the features
   that drive their visits and purchases.

Mind the (Emotional Connection) Gap

   The “emotional connection score” (ECS) of a brand measures the share of
   customers who are fully connected. A gap between a brand’s ECS and the
   share of customers who consider it a “good brand” signals an
   opportunity to transform satisfied customers into fully connected—and
   more valuable—ones. Gaps between a brand’s ECS and competitors’
   indicate opportunities to seize (or maintain) advantage by attending to
   emotional connections.

   On the basis of its modeling, the retailer predicted that the option to
   purchase online and pick up in-store—something that few customers say
   is important and that was available only on a limited basis—would be a
   key driver of emotional connection (it speaks to Flourishers’ desire to
   “feel a sense of freedom”). It tested targeted communication and
   in-store promotion of the option and saw a material lift in sales; it
   has now committed capital to a nationwide rollout of the capability.
   Similarly, the retailer predicted that seeing imagery in-store of
   “people like you” would drive emotional connection and purchasing among
   Flourishers (although they say that this factor is unimportant). As a
   test, it expanded its presence on photo-sharing social media sites and
   encouraged customers to submit selfies showing their favorite outfits
   and styles. Selfie slide shows are (with subjects’ permission)
   displayed on large screens in test stores, thus addressing Flourishers’
   desire to “feel a sense of belonging.” Research indicates that the
   segment has responded to this motivator and increased purchase intent.

   The retailer is now designing and testing store experiences to leverage
   nearly a dozen other drivers of emotional connection.

Online and omnichannel experiences.

   Like individual store environments, online and omnichannel experiences
   can be optimized for emotional connection. To this end the retailer
   quantified the impact of more than 100 omnichannel touchpoints on
   customers’ emotional connection and spending. These included mobile app
   browsing and purchasing, visits to the retailer’s social media pages,
   e-commerce site navigation, and in-store returns of merchandise bought
   online. Each touchpoint was scored according to its potential impact on
   emotional connection and spending. Statistical models then revealed the
   most powerful combinations of touchpoints at each stage of the customer
   journey, allowing the retailer to hone its omnichannel strategy and
   prioritize investments.

   For example, Flourishers say that using a computer to shop online via
   an easy-to-use site is important to purchase decisions. In reality, the
   ease and allure of the mobile site and the availability of services
   such as ApplePay have a far greater impact on emotional connection and
   spending levels. The retailer is using such insights to design
   investments across e-commerce, mobile, and social media that will build
   emotional connections with Flourishers. For instance, it developed
   multiple concepts for the navigational redesign and aesthetic reskin of
   its mobile app, tested how effectively each version enhanced feelings
   of “freedom,” “belonging,” and “thrill” and drove purchases, and rolled
   out the best one.

Merchandising.

   Merchandise selection, from the broad category level to specific
   labels, can be optimized to drive emotional connection. The retailer
   now tracks the purchasing habits of Flourishers nationwide through
   point-of-sale data collected from hundreds of retailers by independent
   research companies. By applying the Flourisher segmentation to these
   POS databases, it has modeled the segment’s purchase behavior across
   more than 20 product categories and 100 labels and learned which of the
   approximately 10 competitive retailers these consumers buy from. The
   resulting insights have exposed gaps in merchandise important to
   Flourishers, and the retailer is working with its manufacturers to
   rebalance its mix.

Message targeting.

   Having identified its Flourisher customers, the retailer can now send
   them personalized messages designed to resonate with the emotional
   motivators that drive behavior at each stage of the customer journey.
   For example, when Flourishers are initially considering the retailer,
   “having fun” while shopping is paramount. At the point of purchase,
   “helps me feel creative” emerges as key. Working from such insights,
   the retailer has developed a series of messages targeting Flourishers
   and timed according to their position in the journey: A rules engine
   sends out e-mails tailored to browsing, transacting, and servicing
   interactions. Response rates to this direct-marketing campaign are 40%
   to 210% higher than historical averages.

About the Research

   Beginning with a two-year research project involving literature review
   and social science experts, we identified 300 universal motivating
   emotions. To measure their impact on consumer behavior, we conducted
   intercept surveys of more than one million U.S. consumers through
   thousands of websites, gathering data across 30 industries and 400-plus
   brands that included measures of brand consideration, trial,
   repurchase, advocacy, customer satisfaction, brand differentiation, and
   emotional connection. Over six more years we collected more than one
   billion data points, including demographic and actual purchase data.
   Using analytical techniques such as multivariate regression and
   structural equation modeling, we determined which emotional motivators
   are most powerfully associated with customer behavior and customer
   value by category and by brand and the degree to which connecting to
   those motivators influences customer behavior, both in absolute terms
   and relative to more commonly measured drivers of behavior.

   Media selection can also be finely tuned to boost emotional connection.
   We profiled the media consumption of Flourishers across 500 TV shows,
   100 websites and social networks, 50 types of mobile apps, 80 print
   publications, and 20 types of radio programming. Working with its ad
   agency, the retailer is executing emotional-connection-based media
   plans. For example, knowing that Flourishers are enthusiastic users of
   Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter, it has scaled up its programs on these
   platforms, which has increased its marketing ROI.

4. Systematize, measure, and learn.

   Leveraging emotional connection does not require turning your business
   processes upside down; you can embed relevant strategies into existing
   work streams. This is most effectively done by making emotional
   connection a key performance indicator and including it on the
   cross-functional senior-management dashboard.

   The retailer developed a scorecard that gives the CEO and the executive
   team a single-page view of customers’ progression on the
   emotional-connection pathway, along with the increase or decrease in
   connected customers of the company and its key competitors. The
   scorecard shows the correlation of customers’ emotional-connection
   scores with lifetime value measures such as annual spending, churn, and
   tenure. It also shows how the business impacts of specific emotions are
   trending and how Flourishers engage with key in-store and omnichannel
   touchpoints that drive emotional connection. In addition, the retailer
   includes emotional-connection metrics in its ongoing testing of media
   messages, store designs, and digital and mobile experiences.

   The results of these strategic and operational changes are startling.
   Same-store sales for stores serving Flourishers realized growth of 3.5%
   over the past year, whereas annual same-store growth over the past five
   years has averaged just 1%. Inventory turns increased more than 25%.
   Market share and customer advocacy also grew (the number of customers
   recommending the retailer is up 20% year-over-year), contributing to
   record-high customer lifetime values. Underlying all these gains is a
   20% rise in the company’s emotional-connection score—largely the result
   of moving satisfied customers to full emotional connection.

The Management Imperative

   Embracing an emotional-connection strategy across the organization
   requires deep customer insights, analytical capabilities, and, above
   all, a managerial commitment to align the organization with the new way
   of thinking. It’s important that marketing not hoard the strategy as
   “its” domain (although the function can and should use emotional
   connection to demonstrate the direct financial impact of its spending).
   Instead, marketing must partner with other functions, teaching and
   socializing emotional connection. The retailer we profiled now uses
   emotional connection to drive alignment across the operations
   management team, the C-suite, and the boardroom. At the outset the CEO
   identified emotional connection as a strategy to restore profitable
   growth. The CFO and the chief strategy officer then “sized the
   financial prize,” leading the heads of marketing, stores, customer
   experience, and merchandising to collaborate on an integrated strategy.

   The advent of big data analytics brings clarity, discipline, and rigor
   to companies’ long-held desire to connect with the customer emotions
   that truly matter. Emotional connections no longer have to be a
   mystery—they can be a new source of real competitive advantage and
   growth.

Executive Summary

   Reprint: R1103C

   Job requirements at the top of corporations have changed. Companies
   have come to expect much more from their C-level executives, who need
   new and different skills to deal with today’s business realities.
   Exactly what abilities do firms want in their leaders—now and in the
   future? By examining hundreds of job profiles developed by
   executive-search firm Heidrick & Struggles and interviewing numerous
   senior managers, the authors have identified some clear trends.

   One strikingly consistent finding is that today technical and
   functional expertise matters less at the top than business acumen and
   “soft” leadership skills do. Members of senior management now have more
   in common with their peers than with the people they manage. To thrive
   at the C-level, you must be a strong communicator, a collaborator, and
   a strategic thinker. You need a global mind-set and will be expected to
   offer your CEO deep insights on key business decisions.

   This article explores those developments in more detail and explains
   other findings about the latest requirements in each of seven C-level
   jobs: CIO, chief marketing and sales officer, CFO, general counsel,
   chief supply-chain management officer, chief human resources officer,
   and CEO. It offers a road map for ambitious managers who want to know
   which skills they should focus on developing in order to rise up the
   chain of command.

The Idea in Brief

   The skills needed for top jobs change with the times. The résumés of
   today’s C-level managers look much different from those of their
   predecessors from 10 or 20 years ago.

   For the senior-most executives, functional and technical expertise has
   become less important than understanding business fundamentals and
   strategy.

   Top-team members now tend to have more in common with their executive
   peers than with the people in the functions they lead. Chief human
   resource officers, for instance, increasingly come from outside HR; IT
   executives now often benefit from a marketing background.

   A recent study on executive recruiting offers insights on the new turns
   and twists in the road to the top.

   We know that different times and different circumstances call for
   different leadership skills. So when it comes to managing your own
   career, how do you prepare yourself to move up? What abilities should
   young would-be executives focus on developing as they choose companies,
   functions, and jobs? And what skills should working executives hone as
   they strive to reach the next level?

   Those aren’t easy questions. The trends vary by function, geography,
   and industry—and, of course, by company. And though we can definitively
   identify the skills that companies seek now, pinpointing those that
   will be useful in the future is unavoidably speculative. Nevertheless,
   in examining hundreds of executive profiles developed over the past
   decade or so by the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles and
   interviewing numerous top managers about the requirements for senior
   leaders past, present, and future, we have seen some clear signals
   about how C-level jobs are evolving.

About the Research

   To identify the critical traits of senior executives past, present, and
   future, we combined data analysis with studies of job descriptions
   created by knowledge management experts.

   First, we examined executive summaries describing why companies were
   recruiting; for example, for the position of chief information officer,
   we read more than 100 profiles prepared for firms that were conducting
   searches. We focused in particular on the themes in the companies’ job
   descriptions and how they ranked various competencies from “essential”
   to “nice to have.” We charted the data first on a timeline (from 10
   years ago to the present), then by sector, and finally by geography.
   Second, we asked search consultants in each function to speculate about
   what the future held for the positions we were surveying. To gather
   information on future requirements for CIOs, for instance, we convened
   several members of search firms’ information technology practices to
   discuss changing business needs (such as balancing innovation with
   simplified computing utility) in light of new technologies. Finally, we
   corroborated our analysis and gathered additional insights by
   conducting interviews with executives who were serving or had served in
   the roles in question.

   One strikingly consistent finding: Once people reach the C-suite,
   technical and functional expertise matters less than leadership skills
   and a strong grasp of business fundamentals. Chief information officers
   need to know how to create business models; chief financial officers,
   how to develop risk management strategies; chief human resource
   officers, how to design a succession plan and a talent structure that
   will provide a competitive edge. In other words, the skills that help
   you climb to the top won’t suffice once you get there. We’re beginning
   to see C-level executives who have more in common with their executive
   peers than they do with the people in the functions they run. And today
   members of senior management are expected not only to support the CEO
   on business strategies but also to offer their own insights and
   contribute to key decisions.

   In this article we’ll explore this trend in more detail and explain
   other findings about skills required in each of seven C-level jobs—CIO,
   chief marketing and sales officer, CFO, general counsel, chief
   supply-chain-management officer, chief human resource officer, and CEO.
   We’ll discuss the competencies that companies have sought over the past
   decade, those currently in demand, and those that, based on experience
   and early evidence, we expect to take precedence in the next decade.
   (For details on the methodology, see the “About the Research” box.) Our
   aim is to draw a road map of sorts for ambitious managers, to help them
   plot their next moves.

The Chief Information Officer

   In the late 1980s and mid 1990s, most executives in information
   technology either had grown up in the function, following a standard
   path from business analyst to director, or were accounting
   professionals with systems experience. Typically, directorship was the
   end of the line. IT leaders were detail-oriented, logical, sequential
   thinkers. But toward the end of that period, as web opportunities burst
   onto the scene, companies began to seek more strategic ways to apply
   technology—using the internet to explore new markets, attract new
   customers, and streamline processes.

   The typical IT director back then wasn’t particularly well versed in
   business strategy or big-picture thinking. Technology departments had
   become too rigid and parochial to respond quickly to new business
   challenges and opportunities. IT directors by and large either pushed
   back with technical reasons for why something couldn’t be done or
   agreed to requests too quickly without challenging their rationale or
   grasping their scope (and then frequently failed to deliver). Across
   geographies and sectors, serious barriers—in both leadership behavior
   and capability—were emerging between the business and technology
   functions. The few executives who could straddle both worlds were in
   high demand.

   In the mid to late 1990s, in response to the lack of business savvy
   among the IT staff, a new position evolved—CIO. The CIO was a senior
   executive who understood not only new technologies but also how they
   applied to business strategy. These new members of the executive team
   were able to broker the complex relationship between business leaders
   and the IT department. They were less exclusively concerned with the
   technology itself and more attuned to how it could generate competitive
   advantage—and more focused on leadership and organizational
   effectiveness. Meanwhile, another phenomenon was emerging:
   globalization. IT managers had to deal with integrating and
   standardizing processes and platforms across multiple operating
   companies, group functions, and regions.

   Then, in 2008, as credit began to dry up, business needs shifted again.
   Though IT had become better aligned with the business (at least when it
   came to improved relationships), IT executives now had to make complex
   decisions based on rigorous analyses of return on investment. Their
   jobs became less about managing projects well and more about managing
   the right projects well. Major technology expenditures needed to be
   justified. A number of CIOs found themselves in over their heads; the
   IT function required a leader who understood the increased complexity
   of business and how IT strategy, business strategy, risk management,
   and finance interacted.

   For the foreseeable future, we expect the demand for a sophisticated
   mix of skills in CIOs will increase. Companies will seek “hybrid” CIOs
   who have not only business savvy but also experience with analytics,
   organizational design, and infrastructure— and who know how to wire
   together a holistic system that can support global growth. In many
   cases, a commercial background will be a plus. Sales and marketing
   knowledge will be considered an advantage when it comes to e-commerce
   initiatives, as will stints in supply-chain management and logistics.

   “I look at myself as a business leader and not as a CIO. I talk to my
   team about how to have different types of conversations. For instance,
   don’t talk about how great the new smartphone is—talk about how it will
   increase sales calls, drive up revenue growth, and improve market
   share.” —CIO, Global Consumer Goods Company

   The most sought-after CIOs will have a keen understanding of how
   companies can put to use the oceans of information they now collect. As
   the CIO of a global consumer goods company explains, “There is a data
   explosion happening around us, but we feel we are well equipped to
   exploit this opportunity and use it as a competitive distinguisher in
   our markets. The ways we share our ideas and gain customer feedback are
   very new and exciting.”

New Requirements for the CIO

   Ability to view the business holistically, across functional, unit, and
   regional boundaries

   Process orientation and comfort with organizational design

   Information analytics knowledge; ability to help companies sort through
   and use information

   Expertise in investment allocation and using ROI to make decisions
   about future IT expenditures

The Chief Marketing and Sales Officer

   For most of the 20th century, the sales and marketing functions had
   narrow business charters and operated as silos. The two functions also
   tended to concentrate on different areas: sales on the
   business-to-business realm and on managing direct salespeople;
   marketing on the business-to-consumer realm. Marketing executives were
   almost exclusively responsible for creative, brand-driven advertising
   initiatives; sales executives were the proprietors of customer
   relationship management at the point of customer contact.
   Well-balanced, integrated marketing-and-sales organizations were rare;
   typically, one function had more power than the other.

   “The global consolidation of sales and marketing will be instrumental
   in allowing us to serve our clients’ needs in a more comprehensive
   way.” —CMO, Global technology and services company

   At the turn of the millennium, marketing and sales still remained
   separate, but both began to broaden in scope as new channels emerged.
   Sales continued to overshadow marketing in B2B companies, but
   e-commerce initiatives forced sales leaders to grapple with some of the
   responsibilities that typically fell to marketing, such as how to
   deliver brand messages directly via the web. Demand for this expanded
   skill set gave rise to the VP of sales and marketing position, which
   became common in more and more companies.

   A full decade later the lines between marketing and sales are
   continuing to blur. Trends like crowdsourcing are accelerating the
   innovation process, and social technologies, interactivity, and
   mobility have become integral to consumer media. Because marketing and
   sales must respond seamlessly to new opportunities, combined roles are
   increasingly prevalent.

   The rise of a new role, chief commercial officer, reflects this shift.
   A 2009 Heidrick & Struggles study found that more than 200 CCOs had
   been appointed worldwide since the title first appeared a decade
   earlier; more than 50 of the appointments occurred in 2008 alone. The
   creation of the position attests to the CEO’s need for a single point
   of contact on the commercial side who can manage innovation, product
   development, marketing, and sales—across all platforms, both digital
   and bricks-and-mortar.

   Technology—in particular, digital channels as touch points—will
   continue to dominate marketing and sales strategy in the future. The
   demand for segmentation capabilities will grow as firms address a more
   diverse population of customers who expect tailored products and
   solutions as well as higher levels of service. Marketing and sales
   executives will be managing a workforce that has grown up in the
   digital age and catering to a customer base that has an ever-increasing
   desire for speed and easy interaction.

New Requirements for the Chief Marketing and Sales Officer

   Significant in-sector experience

   Experience handling the marketing challenges and opportunities
   presented by new channels

   Ability to serve as the CEO’s single point of contact for marketing,
   sales, and e-commerce

   Sophisticated technology know-how, as some distribution becomes more
   channel neutral; skill at managing relationships between commercial and
   technology executives

   Crisis and reputation management skills

   The ability to promote transparency and manage customer communities and
   public conversations

The Chief Financial Officer

   Prior to the early 2000s the typical CFO was a bean counter,
   responsible mainly for reporting the numbers, measuring performance
   with integrity and accuracy, and managing the company’s
   checks-and-balances processes. CFOs had accounting and financial acumen
   as well as strong quantitative skills, but their purview was relatively
   narrow and confined mostly to their department. The typical CFO was
   also country-centric, even at firms with an international presence,
   operating on the theory that regulatory differences made global finance
   too complicated.

   “I think many CFOs a decade ago were probably great ‘stewards’ but saw
   the business more through an accounting lens versus a strategy and
   value-creation lens.”

   Today, however, regional differences loom larger than ever, and
   multinationals no longer have the luxury of keeping finance issues
   within geographical boundaries. Managing a company’s financials has
   become increasingly complex. Most large companies have a head of
   accounting team up with the CFO, who in turn plays a much more
   strategic role.

   As the CFO of a large U.S. retailer explained it to us, a decade ago he
   was a good “steward” but saw the business more through an accounting
   lens than through strategy and value-creation lenses. That is not the
   case for most CFOs today. The top finance job now involves helping the
   CEO and business heads find new opportunities and assess their
   strategic and financial merits and risks. Because risk management has
   gotten much more corporate attention—first in anticipation of Y2K and
   later in the aftermath of 9/11 and business scandals—the chief of
   finance has stepped up to become the CEO’s partner in making ambitious
   but rational choices on a wide range of issues. A once-obscure
   discipline, risk management has squarely hit the executive agenda, and
   CFOs had better be ready for it.

   The top finance job demands a far broader background than it used to.
   As the retired head of finance of one U.S. manufacturer pointed out to
   us, CFOs now need experience with capital markets, mergers, and
   information technologies. In many businesses, CFOs are asked to play a
   more active role in managing external stakeholders and in investor
   communications in particular. They’re also expected to have experience
   in operations and other corporate functional areas—and to encourage
   their subordinates to pursue cross-functional paths to broaden and
   deepen their teams’ skills.

   The CFOs of the future will operate around the globe, in multiple time
   zones, and will regularly partner with nonfinancial areas of the
   business on growth initiatives and international expansion. Thus they
   will need both a commercial sensibility and a global mind-set. (Some of
   the best companies now give their finance leaders international
   assignments to make sure they develop such a mind-set.) And whereas
   today CFOs are required to develop and implement systems and processes
   for budgeting and performance metrics, tomorrow they’ll also be
   required to provide the management team with real-time operational and
   financial data and analyses. They’ll continue to perform the
   traditional functions of managing the finances, reducing costs, and
   putting in place the appropriate controls, but strategic thinking will
   become more important. One retired chief financial officer believes
   that for the future CFO, “being a major contributor to the firm’s
   competitive advantage will be more essential than the compliance
   aspects of the traditional role.”

New Requirements for the CFO

   Experience that matches a company’s current needs—M&A experience for a
   company in growth mode, for instance, or a strong background in
   controls for a company that has experienced restatements or earnings
   violations

   Somewhat reduced focus on accounting skills and increased focus on
   strategic thinking

   Skill at finding the link between accounting and new business models
   and strategy

   Understanding of risk and how to balance it with performance

   A stronger outward focus, particularly when it comes to investor
   relations (though CFOs still need to be good overseers on the
   accounting front)

   A global, as opposed to country-specific, approach to finance

The General Counsel

   Twenty years ago, with some rare and notable exceptions, the general
   counsel role was not a powerful or influential one. The move from a law
   firm to in-house counsel was regarded as the “soft” option; in-house
   lawyers were often deemed second-class citizens in the legal
   profession. They worked shorter hours and made less money. They kept an
   eye on regulatory compliance, closed deals, reviewed documents, and
   dealt with employee issues. The most challenging and important issues
   were typically sent to outside counsel.

   “More-sophisticated corporations look to a balanced general counsel to
   be a facilitator, someone who can play different roles—crisis manager,
   mergers expert, catalyst.” —executive recruiter

   As it did with CFOs, the heightened attention to risk management
   broadened the role of general counsels over time. Safety, security, and
   reputational risks all became central to the senior team’s agenda.
   Companies began to seek legal officers who were adept at anticipating
   and mitigating them before they attracted public scrutiny.
   Increasingly, firms insisted that the top lawyer be at the table to
   discuss new initiatives so that their risks would be thoroughly
   analyzed before rollout. Many general counsels also became viable
   candidates for the job of CEO—evidence of their growing role as
   business partners.

   With these changes the general counsel position began to shed its image
   as a soft job. Because regulatory scrutiny has intensified so much, GCs
   now are under more pressure and work just as hard as, and often get
   paid more than, partners in law firms.

   To land a general counsel job today, a lawyer needs experience
   negotiating with legal and regulatory agencies and industry
   watchdogs—in the U.S., groups like the Department of Justice, the
   Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange
   Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Treasury Department, and
   the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (a bank regulator). And
   whereas corporate lawyers were once expected to understand just the
   rules at home—the assumption was that legal expertise didn’t travel
   across national borders well—CEOs today need lawyers who can operate
   across geographic boundaries.

   A sterling external reputation and a robust outside network—in
   particular, connections with government agencies and authorities—will
   often tip the scale in a given candidate’s favor. In heavily regulated
   industries or ones with a substantial amount of bet-the-company
   courtroom action, litigation experience is attractive, though corporate
   law tends to be the background of choice in some other industries.

   We’ll see a continuation of the trend toward general counsels who
   report directly to chief executives and function as high-level advisers
   to CEOs and their boards. To manage outside law firms, general counsels
   will have to develop new strengths in strategic and business knowledge,
   financial skills, and collaboration. They will also need the agility to
   explore alternative fee models while maintaining the quality of legal
   services provided. Amy Schulman, Pfizer’s general counsel, exemplifies
   the new, more versatile breed. She led a major reorganization of the
   company’s legal division and spearheaded the creation of the Pfizer
   Legal Alliance, a group of 19 law firms that are compensated on an
   annual fee, rather than billable hour, basis and are expected to share
   information on Pfizer’s legal business. Recently, Schulman became the
   business lead for Pfizer Nutrition, a unit that provides infant
   formulas and other products for children in more than 60 countries.

   Corporate counsels as a whole will need the drive and skill to deal
   with a range of new and evolving challenges, like content piracy,
   privacy, and environmental initiatives. Though the role of general
   counsel will continue to attract senior partners from law firms,
   companies will be more reluctant to pull executives straight from
   private practice, preferring candidates with in-house experience who
   understand how to manage the people and finances of a legal department
   and how to operate as part of an executive team.

   To help prepare their graduates for the new challenges, law schools
   have begun offering more business-focused and international legal
   courses. Fluency in multiple languages and cultural awareness are also
   key new skills for general counsels.

New Requirements for the General Counsel

   Business acumen

   Ability to interact with the board

   Experience managing an internal legal function

   Ability to negotiate with regulators and watchdog agencies

   Strong external network

   Judgment needed to outsource legal work appropriately and
   cost-effectively

   Knowledge of new environmental regulations and green considerations

The Chief Supply-Chain-Management Officer

   Two decades ago supply-chain management consisted of a handful of
   disciplines that were not systematically linked, and at the turn of the
   millennium that was still largely the case. However, as companies
   expanded internationally, separately handling the different aspects of
   SCM, such as purchasing and warehousing, started to become expensive
   and ineffective. The challenge of cost reduction forced SCMOs to pursue
   strategic sourcing and to build collaborative relationships with
   suppliers. CEOs thus looked for SCMOs who knew how to achieve cost
   efficiencies and possessed operational and outsourcing expertise. But
   10 years ago SCMOs still rarely reported directly to the CEO; the
   function was somewhat removed from the concerns of top management.

   “I have my people work as extended business partners with the other
   business units as part of cross-functional teams. Supply-chain leaders
   should be thinking about the whole enterprise rather than ‘It’s not my
   function.’ The goal is to influence a broader discussion instead of a
   myopic silo perspective.”—chief procurement officer, global airline

   Since then the role of the SCMO has changed. Today supply-chain
   management links the process end to end: Planning, procurement,
   manufacturing/operations, and logistics work together to devise
   economical solutions. The SCMO is expected to know all four functions
   thoroughly and to create an environment in which they share knowledge
   and work together smoothly.

   Sustainability is also rapidly becoming a business imperative for
   executives who manage this function. Companies are finding that they
   can create value by executing and sharing sustainability strategies
   throughout their supply chains, from suppliers to customers. That trend
   is driving managers toward increased transparency; the greater the
   collaboration across the supply chain, the more benefits the company
   discovers.

   In the future SCMOs will continue to be expected to pursue low costs
   through ever more diverse sourcing, both onshore and off. They will
   need to manage long-distance logistics and transportation, taking into
   account unpredictable external factors that could have a major impact
   on costs, such as political instability or the price of oil. Because
   they will also partner with CIOs to invent new ways for their companies
   to interact with customers and suppliers, SCMOs will have to be
   technologically savvy. Beyond all that, they will need to be
   big-picture thinkers who can participate in strategic and operational
   decisions at the highest level. Since SCMOs will be active and equal
   members of the executive team, experience in running a business unit,
   managing a P&L, and interacting with customers will serve them well.

   As they meet the heady pace of change, companies will continually
   adjust their business models. In order to revise their supply practices
   accordingly, SCMOs will need experience in organizational design.
   International experience will grow more critical in the job, too, as
   global distribution becomes more commonplace and more competitive.
   SCMOs will need to understand emerging markets, which will often force
   them to embrace innovation. Distribution and logistics challenges in
   India, for example, are so complicated and challenging that ordinary
   solutions fall short there.

New Requirements for the Chief Supply-Chain-Management Officer

   Commercial acumen

   Understanding of cultural differences and shifting demographics

   Change management skills; facility with cultural change initiatives

   The credibility needed to act as an internal adviser to the CEO and the
   board

   Ability to work with the board to manage succession

   Technological savvy

   Expertise in building compensation and performance into governance
   structures

   Skill at marketing the CHRO position to the rest of the organization

The Chief Human Resource Officer

   Despite widespread acknowledgment that talent is integral to
   competitiveness, HR still struggles to gain clout in the C-suite. The
   HR role has long been viewed as largely administrative, except in the
   most forward-thinking companies, and its leaders have mostly been
   relegated to managing policies and cultural initiatives.

   “A good bellwether of the state of HR will be the function’s ability to
   produce candidates from within its own ranks to take on senior roles at
   companies.”—executive recruiter

   In the early 2000s, as globalization hit full force and multinational
   companies from mature markets expanded further into developing
   countries, hiring and managing talent became more complicated. Cultural
   differences created internal tensions and confused recruiting
   efforts—making strong talent programs more vital than ever. Because
   it’s difficult to compare leaders from vastly different markets,
   companies began to acutely need personnel development systems that
   could be applied in a variety of settings. Nonetheless, at many
   companies HR still has something of a PR problem—and, with few
   exceptions, appears largely to react to rather than shape changes in
   the business world.

   Some of the fault clearly lies with CEOs, who typically fail to define
   what they expect from their CHROs. And although compliance, risk, and
   executive compensation all belong on the CEO’s agenda, many CEOs do not
   understand how to leverage the HR function to help address those
   topics. As Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, was quoted as saying
   in the New York Times, “The discipline I believe so strongly in is HR,
   and it’s the last discipline that gets funded. Marketing,
   manufacturing—all these things are important. But more often than not,
   the head of HR does not have a seat at the table. Big mistake.”

   But there are signs of change. Instead of turning to career HR
   practitioners, companies are increasingly filling the CHRO role with
   leaders from functions on the business side, such as operations,
   marketing, or corporate law. One financial services company, for
   instance, which has long pointed to its sophisticated HR practices as a
   key source of competitive advantage, recently appointed a legal
   professional as its CHRO, in large part in response to the complex
   regulatory environment. Legal issues, in fact, are consuming more and
   more of HR executives’ bandwidth—often to ill effect. Another financial
   services firm has seen a marked rise in turnover of late as its CHRO
   has been forced to spend most of her time dealing with regulatory and
   compensation issues, leaving other parts of the HR job undermanaged.

   If companies continue to award top HR jobs to non-HR executives, the
   CHROs of the future will be more likely to have an understanding of
   commercial models, as well as experience with change management and
   finding pragmatic solutions to complex issues. And they will put extra
   pressure on HR specialists in functions like talent management to shift
   their focus from theory to business management.

   As companies make more cross-border acquisitions, HR leaders will have
   to become more culturally and internationally astute. Ideally, they
   will have lived and worked in several regions. Such experience will
   give them a more nuanced understanding of how dissimilar cultures
   interact and help them make the most effective use of people with very
   different backgrounds. It will also help them create a high-performing
   organization with the least possible disruption—a tall order.

   In general, because of changing workforce demographics, HR executives
   will have to be comfortable managing a staff that is more diverse. They
   will need to adeptly juggle the needs and contributions of experienced
   boomers, eager millennials, and professionals from emerging economies,
   to name a few.

   Compensation will continue to be a hot topic, and not just in the
   financial services industry. Grounding in global remuneration practices
   and in the financial modeling, taxation, accounting, and legal issues
   surrounding compensation will help HR leaders build their companies’
   capabilities and gain credibility with senior leadership teams and
   boards of directors. The heads of HR also must be integrally involved
   in designing and implementing leadership succession plans—a matter that
   is woefully neglected in the majority of companies.

   It may sound cliché, but attracting and developing top talent is the
   most important job of the CEO, and the chief HR officer should, in
   partnership with business heads, lead the charge.

The Chief Executive Officer

   Many people have written about how the CEO role has evolved, so we
   won’t go into depth here. We did, however, note a few trends that are
   influencing the direction the job is going in. First, it’s less and
   less common for board members to be selected by the CEO, as boards and
   their nominating committees have assumed primary responsibility for
   director recruitment. However, it’s now more common for the CEOs to owe
   their jobs to the boards rather than to their predecessors. That shift
   will mean more accountability at the top. Interestingly, boards have
   also become a source of CEO candidates. Over the past year there was a
   notable jump in the number of CEOs who were recruited from their
   company’s board, according to an October Newswire article.

   “The critical functions for today’s CEO are to listen, listen,
   listen…and communicate, communicate, communicate.”—executive recruiter

   Second, the types of skills increasingly in favor are strong
   communication, empathy, collaboration, and trust building. One skill
   that will be of foremost importance will be the ability to elicit
   public trust as the face of the company. That will include facility and
   credibility with socially responsible initiatives.

   One theme that ran consistently through our findings was that
   requirements for all the C-level jobs have shifted toward business
   acumen and “softer” leadership skills. Technical skills are merely a
   starting point, the bare minimum. To thrive as a C-level executive, an
   individual needs to be a good communicator, a collaborator, and a
   strategic thinker—and we think the trend toward a general business
   orientation over a functional orientation will continue. A CEO would
   now count on a CIO, for instance, to weigh in on a discussion about
   expansion into a new market and how the firm’s systems could support
   that expansion. What would the challenges be? What would be the
   long-term impact of the IT expenditures required to support the
   expansion? The CIO would be expected to provide answers to those
   questions.

   Going forward, C-level executives will not simply manage their own
   business areas; they will be active members of the firm’s senior
   leadership who advise the CEO on key decisions. As one executive
   recruiter put it, “The C-level person today needs to be more
   team-oriented, capable of multitasking continuously and leading without
   rank, and able to resist stress and make sure that his subordinates do
   not burn out. And he needs to do all of this with a big smile in an
   open plan office. In other words, we’re looking at a whole new breed of
   top executive.”

   Business Review.
