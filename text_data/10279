Approvals

   The IF13 power cord with integrated filter is the easiest way to
   integrate an EMC filter into a given design (with a power cord). The
   approach to incorparate the filter in an external cable can help to
   pass compliance testing at the end of the design phase. The performance
   of the filter is enhanced through the ferrite cable and shielding. With
   different versions of input and output connections the cord can be
   easily implemented. Complying with RoHS and REACH the power cords
   fulfill worldwide environmental regulations.

Features and benefits

     * Easy to implement, no redesign required
     * EMC lifeline at last design stage
     * High performance in high frequency range
     * Retrofit for cord connected devices
     * no space allocation required for filter

Typical applications

     * All cord connected applications
     * Datacenter
     * Communication Technology
     * Medical and Laboratory devices
     * Security applications
     * High frequency applications
     * Applications with critical housing dimensions (cable is external)
