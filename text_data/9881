Chennai floods in December 2015 man-made, says CAG Report

One of the key reservoirs storing water for the Chennai city, the
Chembarambakkam reservoir was not operated on full capacity, said the report.

   Chennai-flood-bccl The CAG report makes particular mention of the
   operating of the Chembarambakkam tank between December 1, 2015, and the
   next day.
   CHENNAI: The massive floods that swept Chennai, Kanchipuram and other
   districts in December 2015 were due to failure of various state
   government agencies to heed the recommendations of expert committees on
   flood mitigation, check dam building and other measures, said a CAG
   report.
   One of the key reservoirs storing water for the Chennai city, the
   Chembarambakkam reservoir was not operated on full capacity, said the
   report. "An abrupt and uncontained release of water from
   Chembarambakkam reservoir contributed to the massive disaster.
   Imprudent and injudicious action by tank in charge warrants detailed
   enquiry," the report said.
   The CAG report makes particular mention of the operating of the
   Chembarambakkam tank between December 1, 2015, and the next day. "The
   discharge of water continuously from 29000 cusec for 21 hours from
   01/12/2015 -- 1800 hours to 02/12/2015 -- 1500 hours into the Adyar
   river coupled with surplus water from upstream are and catchment area
   caused huge flow of flood water into Adyar river."
   The report categorically states the "injudicious decision to
   indiscriminately increase the discharge of water from 12000 cusec to
   29000 cusec" has proved that the disaster was indeed a "man-made"
   catastrophe.
   The 127-page report also detailed various inefficiencies on the part of
   the state water resources department in installing warning systems. It
   also called for a detailed Inquiry into the officials responsible for
   the operation of the Chembarambakkam reservoir.
   The report also mentioned that "no records were made available to the
   audit to ascertain the fact that the tank in-charge communicated with
   the government/ departmental authorities on the incoming flood."

Chennai floods in December 2015 man-made, says CAG Report

One of the key reservoirs storing water for the Chennai city, the
Chembarambakkam reservoir was not operated on full capacity, said the report.

   Chennai-flood-bccl The CAG report makes particular mention of the
   operating of the Chembarambakkam tank between December 1, 2015, and the
   next day.
   CHENNAI: The massive floods that swept Chennai, Kanchipuram and other
   districts in December 2015 were due to failure of various state
   government agencies to heed the recommendations of expert committees on
   flood mitigation, check dam building and other measures, said a CAG
   report.
   One of the key reservoirs storing water for the Chennai city, the
   Chembarambakkam reservoir was not operated on full capacity, said the
   report. "An abrupt and uncontained release of water from
   Chembarambakkam reservoir contributed to the massive disaster.
   Imprudent and injudicious action by tank in charge warrants detailed
   enquiry," the report said.
   The CAG report makes particular mention of the operating of the
   Chembarambakkam tank between December 1, 2015, and the next day. "The
   discharge of water continuously from 29000 cusec for 21 hours from
   01/12/2015 -- 1800 hours to 02/12/2015 -- 1500 hours into the Adyar
   river coupled with surplus water from upstream are and catchment area
   caused huge flow of flood water into Adyar river."
   The report categorically states the "injudicious decision to
   indiscriminately increase the discharge of water from 12000 cusec to
   29000 cusec" has proved that the disaster was indeed a "man-made"
   catastrophe.
   The 127-page report also detailed various inefficiencies on the part of
   the state water resources department in installing warning systems. It
   also called for a detailed Inquiry into the officials responsible for
   the operation of the Chembarambakkam reservoir.
   The report also mentioned that "no records were made available to the
   audit to ascertain the fact that the tank in-charge communicated with
   the government/ departmental authorities on the incoming flood."
