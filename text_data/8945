   wizard makes determining stream settings a breeze and I can easily
   incorporate stream add-ons like notifications, custom layouts etc.

   "I have been using XSplit Broadcaster for over 5 years. It was easy to
   set up when I first started and adding on more advance features was
   easy as I keep on using it throughout the years. As a pro player, we
   gain followers thru showing our skills and hardwork in tournaments, but
   since i started streaming it had helped me gain more followers by
   sharing my knowledge to the world."
