New Benefit: Pay Later

   Introducing Book Now, Pay Later**. Now, you can book your flights with
   no money down, and you’ll enjoy the flexibility of changing flights
   with no change fees when you book refundable airfares. You’ll get all
   the same great benefits Flights by Celebrity offers, plus the
   convenience of locking in your flights and the fare without having to
   pay for the airfare at time of booking. Pay for your flights at the
   same time as your cruise final payment. It’s the newest premium benefit
   of Flights by Celebrity.

Testimonials

   "Booked Flights by Celebrity for our Mediterranean Cruise. Tampa to
   Washington, DC to Rome. Flight delays caused us to miss our connecting
   flight...Flights by Celebrity quickly re-routed us to a later flight to
   DC sent us to Munich then on the Rome we made the ship with minutes to
   spare!"

   By Anonymous


   "I made the mistake of NOT booking Flights By Celebrity on my first
   cruise with Celebrity. My flight was cancelled 6 hours prior to
   departure. I immediately regretted not booking with air professionals
   who are familiar with the cruise industry. I promised myself at that
   moment I would always book air through Flights By Celebrity"
