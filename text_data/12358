Mr. Egret

   Egret

   He is the most dapper fellow.

   He has travelled over 7000 km an is none the worse for wear.

   But he has requested an airy glass dome, preferably antique.

   And he would like the salon painted a more complementary colour.

   We all, at some point in our lives, go to great lengths for love.

   And I am truly smitten.
