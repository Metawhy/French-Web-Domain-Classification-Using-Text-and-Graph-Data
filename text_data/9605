Meet Anthony William

   #1 New York Times best-selling author of Medical Medium, Life-Changing
   Foods, Thyroid Healing, and Liver Rescue was born with the unique
   ability to converse with Spirit of Compassion who provides him with
   extraordinarily accurate health information that’s often far ahead of
   its time.

   Since age four, when he shocked his family by announcing that his
   symptom-free grandmother had lung cancer (which medical testing soon
   confirmed), Anthony has been using his gift to “read” people’s
   conditions and tell them how to recover their health.

   His unprecedented accuracy and success rate as the Medical Medium have
   earned him the trust and love of millions worldwide, among them movie
   stars, rock stars, billionaires, professional athletes, best-selling
   authors, and countless other people from all walks of life who couldn’t
   find a way to heal until he provided them with insights from Spirit.
   Anthony has also become an invaluable resource to doctors who need help
   solving their most difficult cases.

   Anthony William is also the originator of the Global Celery Juice
   Movement. Millions of people are healing thanks to drinking 16 ounces
   of straight celery juice on an empty stomach every day–a specific
   healing practice that Anthony has been recommending since I was a child
   in 1975. With the release of his four bestselling books, all of which
   include information about the undiscovered healing properties of celery
   juice, millions of people have now tried celery juice and found it to
   offer them improvement, relief and healing from all kinds of acute and
   chronic illnesses and symptoms, including digestive issues, skin
   conditions, migraines, fatigue, autoimmune illnesses, brain fog, and
   hundreds of others.

   What if you could focus on one aspect of your well-being to transform
   all the others—and at the same time prevent health problems you didn't
   even know lurk beneath the surface? In today's world, we have no idea
   how many symptoms, conditions, and diseases are rooted in an overloaded
   liver. It's not only about liver cancer, cirrhosis, and hepatitis.

   Nearly every challenge, from pesky general health complaints to
   digestive issues to emotional struggles to weight gain to high blood
   pressure to heart problems to brain fog to skin conditions to
   autoimmune and other chronic illnesses, has an origin in an overloaded
   liver and can improve and heal when you harness the force of this
   humble organ.
