The impact of food waste

   In the United States, over one-third of all available food goes uneaten
   through loss or waste. When food is tossed aside, so too are
   opportunities for improved food security, economic growth, and
   environmental prosperity. USDA is uniquely positioned to help address
   the problem of food loss and waste through its programs, policies, and
   guidance.

   Frequently Asked Questions

Does the U.S. have a food loss and waste reduction goal?

   Yes, September 16, 2015, the first-ever national food loss and waste
   goal in the United States was launched, calling for a 50-percent
   reduction by 2030. USDA and EPA will work in partnership with
   charitable organizations, faith organizations, the private sector, and
   local, state and tribal governments to reduce food loss and waste in
   order to improve overall food security and conserve our nation’s
   natural resources.

How much food waste is there in the United States and why does it matter?

   In the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent
   of the food supply. This estimate, based on estimates from USDA’s
   Economic Research Service of 31 percent food loss at the retail and
   consumer levels, corresponded to approximately 133 billion pounds and
   $161 billion worth of food in 2010. This amount of waste has
   far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation and
   climate change:
     * Wholesome food that could have helped feed families in need is sent
       to landfills.
     * The land, water, labor, energy and other inputs used in producing,
       processing, transporting, preparing, storing, and disposing of
       discarded food are pulled away from uses that may have been more
       beneficial to society – and generate impacts on the environment
       that may endanger the long-run health of the planet.
     * Food waste, which is the single largest component going into
       municipal landfills, external link quickly generates methane,
       helping to make landfills the third largest source of methane in
       the United States.  external link

How does USDA contribute to reducing food loss and waste?

   New and ongoing USDA initiatives are already building momentum for food
   loss and waste reductions:
     * In 2013, USDA and EPA joined together to launch the U.S. Food Waste
       Challenge to provide a platform to assess and disseminate
       information about the best practices to reduce, recover, and
       recycle food loss and waste. By the end of 2014, the joint U.S.
       Food Waste Challenge (EPA plus USDA) had over 4,000 participants,
       well surpassing its goal of 1,000 participants by 2020.  USDA is
       working to grow this list and expand food loss and waste reduction
       efforts from farm to fork.
     * Reducing food loss and waste is core to USDA’s mission. USDA
       supports numerous programs and policies targeted to improving
       market and distributional efficiencies. Recently, USDA has
       instigated a wide variety of initiatives to reduce food loss and
       waste, including an app to help consumers safely store food and
       understand food date labels, new guidance to manufacturers and
       importers on donating misbranded or sub-spec foods, and research on
       innovative technologies to make reducing food loss and waste cost
       effective. USDA will build on these successes with additional
       initiatives targeting food loss and waste reduction throughout its
       programs and policies.

What baseline estimates of food loss and waste will be used to measure
progress in reaching the 50 percent reduction goal?

   The United States currently does not have a single baseline estimate of
   food loss and waste. Instead, two very different measures describe the
   amount of food loss and waste in the United States:
     * EPA estimates: 2010 was selected as a baseline at 218.9 pounds of
       food waste per person sent for disposal. The 2030 FLW reduction
       goal aims to reduce food waste going to landfills by 50 percent to
       109.4 pounds per person.
     * USDA estimates the amount of food loss and waste from the food
       supply at the retail and consumer levels: in 2010 food loss and
       waste at the retail and consumer levels was 31 percent of the food
       supply, equaling 133 billion pounds and almost $162 billion.

   Neither estimate provides a comprehensive evaluation of food loss and
   waste in the United States.  However, reductions in both these
   estimates will provide evidence of progress in reducing food loss and
   waste and the serious environmental impacts associated with landfilling
   food. A variety of other data collection efforts across the country
   will help provide information on other segments of the supply chain.

How is food waste defined in the context of the U.S. Food Waste Challenge?

   USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) defines food loss as the edible
   amount of food, postharvest, that is available for human consumption
   but is not consumed for any reason. It includes cooking loss and
   natural shrinkage (for example, moisture loss); loss from mold, pests,
   or inadequate climate control; and food waste. For the U.S. Food Waste
   Challenge, USDA is adopting the convention of using the general term
   “food loss and waste” to describe reductions in edible food mass
   anywhere along the food chain. In some of the statistics and activities
   surrounding recycling, the term “waste” is stretched to include
   non-edible (by humans) parts of food such as banana peels, bones, and
   egg shells.

What is the U.S. Food Waste Challenge?

   On June 4, 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge,
   calling on entities across the food chain – farms, agricultural
   processors, food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants,
   universities, schools, and local governments – to join efforts to
     * Reduce food waste by improving product development, storage,
       shopping/ordering, marketing, labeling, and cooking methods.
     * Recover food waste by connecting potential food donors to hunger
       relief organizations like food banks and pantries.
     * Recycle food waste to feed animals or to create compost, bioenergy
       and natural fertilizers.

   By joining the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, organizations and businesses
   demonstrate their commitment to reducing food waste, helping to feed
   the hungry in their communities, and reducing the environmental impact
   of wasted food.  The Challenge’s inventory of activities will help
   disseminate information about the best practices to reduce, recover,
   and recycle food waste and stimulate the development of more of these
   practices. The inventory of activities and participants will also
   provide a snapshot of the country’s commitment to—and successes
   in—reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste. The Challenge
   includes a specific goal of 400 participants by 2015 and 1,000 by 2020.

Who is invited to join the U.S. Food Waste Challenge?

   Organizations in the U.S. food chain that currently create food waste
   are invited to join the U.S. Food Waste Challenge.  This includes
   producer groups, processors, manufacturers, distributors, retailers,
   food service, industry groups, NGO’s, state, county and city
   governments, and other Federal agencies. Individual consumer
   activities, though very important to the goal of reducing, recovering,
   and recycling food waste, will not be included on the U.S. Food Waste
   Challenge website.

How can participants join in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge?

   There are two ways to join the U. S. Food Waste Challenge:
    1. Either participants complete the USDA activity form listing the key
       activities they are or will practice to reduce, recover, or recycle
       food waste in their operations. USDA will post these activities on
       its website.
    2. Or, participants join via participation in the EPA Food Recovery
       Challenge external link and benefit from EPA’s technical assistance
       to set specific quantitative food-waste goals and attain them!

   Participants can also do both!

What is the difference between the U.S. Food Waste Challenge and EPA's Food
Recovery Challenge?

   The U.S. Food Waste Challenge is an umbrella challenge that includes
   both participants who join via filling out the USDA activity form and
   participants of EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge.

   EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge external link offers participants access
   to data management software and technical assistance to help them
   quantify and improve their sustainable food management practices.
   Participants enter goals and report food waste diversion data annually
   into EPA’s data management system. They then receive an annual climate
   profile report that translates their food diversion data results into
   greenhouse gas reductions as well as other measures such as “cars off
   the road” to help participants communicate the benefits of activities
   implemented. EPA provides on-going technical assistance to EPA’s Food
   Recovery Challenge participants to encourage continuous improvement.

What is a U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champion?

   U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions are businesses and
   organizations that have made a public commitment to reduce food loss
   and waste in their own operations in the United States by 50 percent by
   the year 2030.

How does a company become a U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champion?

   To join the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions, organizations
   complete and submit the 2030 Champions form (LINK FORM), in which they
   commit to reduce food loss and waste in their own operations and
   periodically report their progress on their website.

Does USDA or EPA verify the Champions’ food loss and waste reduction
estimates?

   The exact definition of food loss and waste could vary by country,
   business and consumer. U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions are
   encouraged to consult the Food Loss and Waste Protocol for information
   on defining and transparently measuring food loss and waste. It is at
   the Champion’s discretion whether to calculate the 50% reduction on an
   absolute or per customer/consumer basis.

Does USDA or EPA provide technical support to measure food loss and waste?

   U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions can join EPA’s Food Recovery
   Challenge to access technical assistance for measuring food waste and
   assessing the positive environmental benefits of waste reduction.

Are there any government recognition programs for businesses that are not
ready to commit to a 50% reduction goal but are working to reduce, recover
and recycle food loss and waste in their operations?

   Businesses that are not ready to make the 50-percent reduction
   commitment but are engaged in efforts to reduce food loss and waste in
   their operations can be recognized for their efforts by either
   joining the Food Recovery Challenge or the U.S. Food Waste Challenge.

Why did USDA and EPA establish the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions
and how is it different than the U.S. Food Waste Challenge?

   USDA and EPA launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge in 2013 as a way to
   raise awareness about food loss and waste in the United States and
   about steps that businesses and organizations are taking to reduce it.
   More than 4,500 entities have signed up for the U.S. Food Waste
   Challenge, demonstrating the growing momentum around this issue in the
   United States.  Reaching the new national goal of cutting food loss and
   waste in half by 2030, which was announced in 2015, is going to require
   renewed commitments to aggressively cut food loss and waste. USDA and
   EPA established the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions initiative
   as a way of ramping up national efforts to meet this goal.

What are the three food loss and waste recognition programs maintained by
USDA and EPA?

   U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions
   /oce/foodwaste/Champions/index20161108.htm

   Launched in 2016, U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions are
   businesses and organizations that have made a public commitment to
   reduce food loss and waste in their own operations in the United States
   by 50 percent by the year 2030.

   Food Recovery Challenge

   -frc

   Launched in 2011, the Food Recovery Challenge is designed for
   organizations seeking to track their food waste reduction activities.
   Members can join as participants if they are generating food waste or
   as endorsers if they are not generating their own food waste but can
   help others reduce their waste (i.e., organizations looking to help
   educate or recruit for the FRC) with requirements to provide data or
   report activities/accomplishments to the challenge.  Members are
   eligible for awards based on their accomplishments which are given
   annually.  EPA provides technical assistance and a free climate report
   to participants.  The Food Recovery Challenge currently has more than
   800 participants and has prevented and diverted millions of tons of
   food since it started.

   U.S. Food Waste Challenge
   /oce/foodwaste/

   Launched in 2013, the U.S. Food Waste Challenge is designed for
   organizations seeking to make a public pledge/disclosure of their
   activities to reduce food waste.  Participants make a one-time pledge
   with their name and activities listed on USDA’s website.  The goal of
   the U.S. Food Waste Challenge is to disseminate information about best
   practices to reduce, recover, and recycle food loss and waste.
