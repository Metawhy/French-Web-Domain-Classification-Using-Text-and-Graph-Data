MIXED BERRY OVERNIGHT OATS

   Sara Forte · August 19, 2019
   overnight-oats-01.jpg overnight-oats-01.jpg

   For my boy, the day before Kindergarten:

   This all felt like a lifetime away when you were teeny tiny and now,
   cliche as it sounds, it feels like it snuck up on me. Older folks will
   tell you ‘it goes by quickly,’ and when you are in those early years of
   parenting, it feels like no such pace. Yet, as we’re on the eve of the
   first day of kindergarten, and you’re trying on polo shirts and getting
   a larger lunchbox and reviewing how we handle conflict with friends
   that should maybe be a liiitttllleee less physical than how you bicker
   with your spicy little sister, and it truly does feel like a wildly
   quick, albeit full, five years.
   Nov 12, 2014 - 0727.jpg Nov 12, 2014 - 0727.jpg

   It likely all went unnoticed by you, but deciding where to put you for
   school this year has caused me all sorts of worry and stress and back
   and forth. Knowing that we have a choice in this shows immense
   privilege and I do not take that for granted. I hope one day you see
   that going to school with daily support from your teachers and parents
   to learn and grow is a gift not everyone gets. I will remind you of
   that when it feels hard to hustle out the door or do homework when you
   just want to play. I wanted to choose what would be best for you but I
   also see now that I was protecting myself, as well.

   Should we hold him back? He cries easily. He’ll be the youngest.

   Should we drive further to the better school? I want him to have
   friends close to our house.

   Do we do this or that Spanish immersion school? It will be frustrating
   for him, different, more difficult, he’ll be behind.

   I could talk myself into and out of each option on any given day. In
   the eleventh hour, we grabbed the last spot at the dual immersion
   school you are heading to and buddy, I feel really good about it.

   I am overly empathetic with you and your sister, and it is tough for me
   to rise above your emotions sometimes. As an adult, I hope that will
   read as an extension of my deep affection for you, but in these young
   years, I know that you look to me for stability. When you cry about
   getting a shot, I probably shouldn’t cry too ;) If you come home
   unhappy from school, I would blame myself for making the wrong choice,
   and I think I was trying to find some way to avoid that. But here is
   what a wise mentor reminded me: it is not my job as your parent to make
   everything easy and comfortable for you. A child who does not learn how
   to work through hard things themselves, how to rise to the occasion and
   figure things out, won’t have those necessary skills to handle
   difficult things as they grow up and out of our care.
   Jul 28, 2016 - 0976.jpg Jul 28, 2016 - 0976.jpg

   My job is to support and love you and encourage you - to protect you,
   yes, but not from a challenge. I want to step in when I see someone
   take your sand toy at the beach or your sister rages at you, but I also
   want you to be confident that YOU know how (or can learn how) to handle
   those circumstances on your own. It may not soak in until I am gone or
   you are a parent yourself, but I hope that you look back on your
   experience of me and see that I truly did the best I could to parent
   you. That doesn’t mean it will all look right by you, and I’ll be the
   first to say I’ve messed up, and will continue to, but I truly do
   delight in you. You are loved so completely by your family.
   Dec 15, 2017 - 1073.jpg Dec 15, 2017 - 1073.jpg

   I know that you are kind. I know that you are a good friend and will
   stick up for your people. I know that you want to be silly and make
   people laugh. I know that you are incredibly curious and so bright,
   Curran. From here on out, school will be a big part of your life and is
   just as much an education in people as it is in every other subject.
   Ask questions. Include people. Do your best. Choose grace. Speak up for
   yourself and others. “Cool” is temporary, “nice” leaves an actual
   impression - be nice.
   Home is always here. You will forever have a cheerleader in me. I love
   you so much, my baby.

   - Mommy

MIXED BERRY OVERNIGHT OATS

   Makes 6 small servings

   I admit I am not really a fan of cold oats, but my kids love these. I
   did not invent overnight oats, but these are the ratios we’ve been
   using for a creamy, pudding-like texture. It will looks thin at first,
   but that liquid is absorbed by the oats and chia to thicken the
   situation. My kids love carbs; but this adds some fiber and protein and
   healthy fats so they don’t have a blood sugar crash.

Ingredients

   1 1/2 cups nut or oat milk
   1 cup plain yogurt (dairy-free varieties work too!)
   2 Tbsp. ground flax
   2 Tbsp. chia seeds
   2-3 Tbsp. maple syrup
   1 tsp. vanilla extract
   1 1/4 cups old fashioned oats
   1/2 tsp. cinnamon
   pinch of salt
   1 lb. of mixed berries - blueberries, chopped strawberries, cherries
   etc.

for topping

   yogurt
   cocoa nibs
   toasted coconut
   toasted nuts
   granola

instructions

   In a large mixing bowl, combine the milk, yogurt, flax chia, maple and
   vanilla and stir well to combine. Add the oats, cinnamon, a big pinch
   of salt and mix. Stir in half of the berries. You could also just top
   with the berries, but I find my kids don’t try to pick at it if the
   berries are just non-negotiably in there.

   Transfer the overnight oats into portioned containers and pop them in
   the fridge for two hours or overnight.

   The next morning, garnish with remaining berries, more desired toppings
   and enjoy!
   Oat cups will keep in the fridge for 3-5 days.

                             LENTIL-CAULI TACO MEAT

   Sara Forte · July 30, 2019

   cauliflower and lentil tacos 'meat' cauliflower and lentil tacos 'meat'

   Ok. I had to double post on both SKCC and here because so many of you
   asked me for this recipe. The first time I made this, I was literally
   grasping at what was left in the fridge. It made a wet gross mush in a
   pot that I had no interest in eating, so I tried to save it by drying
   it out in the oven because I HATE wasting food. It had crispy edges and
   a deep tomato flavor and I ate it for three meals straight. To be
   honest with you, I cannot get it as good as it was the first time.
   Below is something pretty damn close.

   My family does eat meat, but in an effort towards sustainability and
   health, we eat a lot of vegetarian meals. Love a good mushroom taco, or
   even some saucy tempeh, but this mixture has the crumbly, spicy, crisp
   edges I remember from the ground beef tacos of my youth. Chili, sloppy
   joes, tacos, hamburger helper, any other babies of the 80’s know that
   dinner rotation?

   If you give it a whirl. Let me know your thoughts. I’ve used it in
   tacos, as shown, but also sprinkled it in a salad with avocado and
   peaches and pepitas, and put it in burritos for my wee ones. You could
   add rice and stuff it into bell peppers (there is a recipe in my story
   highlights). Anyway, you get the idea.
     __________________________________________________________________

LENTIL-CAULI TACO MEAT

   Makes about 4 cups / Serves 6

   If you need to cut a corner, use the steamed lentils from Trader Joes.
   I actually prefer them - they are drier than the ones I cook at home.
   Keep an eye on it while it’s in the oven, and stir it around. We want
   to dry it out to get some crunchy edges.

   Try it in tortillas with smashed avocado, cabbage and taco sauce below.

Quicky Taco Sauce

     * Blitz Together:
     * + 1 cup plain, whole greek yogurt
     * + 1 jalapeno
     * + 1 large garlic clove
     * + zest & juice of 1 lime
     * + small bunch cilantro
     * + salt & pepper

Ingredients

   2 Tbsp. avocado or extra virgin olive oil
   1/2 a yellow onion, roughly chopped
   3 garlic cloves
   1 (1.5 lb.) head of cauli, leaves and core removed, broken into florets
   (or 12 oz. fresh, not frozen, riced-cauli)
   3/4 tsp. Kosher salt/ 1/2 tsp. sea salt
   Fresh ground pepper
   1/2 tsp. cumin
   1 tsp. chili powder
   1 tsp. coriander
   1 cup canned tomato sauce (I like Muir Glen!)
   1 cup cooked lentils, drained

Instructions

   Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Preheat the oven to 400’ and
   line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment.

   Into a food processor, add the onions and garlic. Pulse a few times to
   chop well. Transfer to the pot with the hot oil and give it a quick
   stir. Put the cauli florets into the food processor and pulse, scraping
   down the sides every few times until it is in tiny rice-like pieces.
   Add it to the pot along with salt and pepper, sauté about 5 minutes
   until things soften and get golden in places.

   Add the cumin, chili powder, coriander (or about 1 Tbsp. taco
   seasoning) and stir. Add the tomato sauce and lentils, stir again.
   You’re going to think it looks like a soggy mess, but press on! Turn
   off the heat, let the mixture cool down.

   Transfer the cauli mixture to the prepared baking sheet and spread it
   in an even layer. Let all the steam off, then bake it in the upper
   third for 35 minutes, stirring once or twice during the baking time.
   Turn the oven up to 450’, and cook another 5-10 minutes. Turn off the
   oven, but leave the tray in there for another 10-15 minutes to dry it
   out further. The moisture level will be different per person because
   some cauli can be pretty watery, lentils can have different textures
   etc. It should look a little charred in spots. Stir it around to cool.

   Assemble as you wish - into a taco or roasted sweet potato or room temp
   into a taco salad. We didn’t make it super spicy so it would be
   kid-friendly too.

   Store covered in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze for up to a
   few months.

                           OATMEAL BREAKFAST COOKIES

   Sara Forte · May 29, 2019

   breakfast-cookies-01.JPG breakfast-cookies-01.JPG

   We have this “breakfast cookie” recipe going out to our Cooking Club
   members this week and I wanted to put the recipe here too. The feeding
   babies section is a crowd favorite, and my kids plow through these.
   Healthy-ish, grab n’ go, and what not - that’s what ya’ll seem to love
   about the kids recipes I’ve included around here. It’s tough to find a
   cookie or muffin that hold together that are both gluten and egg-free,
   but these work. Report back if you make them, or let me know what you
   changed. I love seeing your photos!

   Our son turned FIVE this weekend. It felt like a big birthday - every
   increment of five does to me for some reason. My mom always made a big
   deal of birthdays and I thought it was so fun - I love making him feel
   like the star of the weekend and the one to make all the calls. We
   packed the weekend with Legoland, camping with cousins in San Clemente,
   rocket launching in a field, Chuck-e-Cheese with grandparents, meals of
   his choice, sprinkle cupcakes etc. etc. It sounds like a lot because it
   was :)

   I feel like we were chin deep in both baby and toddler-hood at the same
   time for the past few years, and seeing Curran now as an
   almost-kindergartener is wild. Like we’ve been treading water, and now
   we can swim. He is thoughtful and emotional and smart and empathetic -
   LOVES his dad, lights up with the company of friends, is ALWAYS the
   first person to wake up in the morning with a full tank of energy, very
   into building things, collector, can recall specific memories in full
   detail from way before I thought was possible (“remember when I choked
   on that frozen mango?”…you were one, how do you remember that?!?!). He
   has figured out that throwing clothes in the hamper is quicker than
   folding and putting them away which I find both annoying and clever -
   for some reason it’s a nod from toddler to kid - those little things
   that feel different.

   Curran and I had a tough time with each other during his 2-4 age
   because he is pretty sensitive, and it would touch on an insecurity of
   my own - both of us then upset, neither bringing calm to the situation.
   I thought I was self-aware enough to not ride my toddlers emotions but
   I did… do, sometimes still. He’s better lately, and I am too, far from
   perfect, but it feels like we’ve grown in that area together. Perhaps
   that makes me sound like an immature parent, but little refines us and
   highlights our weak spots like our own children. Anyway, finding a
   better rhythm with him has been so special. I used to want time to
   speed up, I didn’t want to tread water anymore, but the swimming? Now I
   want to stop time! Curran and I have put together more lego sets in the
   past four days than I care to have floating around the house but he
   LOVES them, both the building and the company, so bring on the Legos.

   SIDENOTE: Hugh made a short pdf of quick food photography tips which is
   now available on our SHOP page. For a limited time, it is available for
   $1.99, which will be the best couple bucks you’ll spend this week. It
   is not a full photography course, but the concise and simple tips will
   absolutely make a difference in the way you capture your food. I’ve
   learned so much from Hugh, and this guide boils down the handful of
   important things to think about when you take and edit a photo of your
   food. Let us know if you have any questions!

OATMEAL BREAKFAST COOKIES

   Makes 18 small

   These are delicate, as there is no gluten or egg helping to bind them.
   If you are looking for something to pack in a lunchbox, and can
   tolerate eggs, add one in to the mashed banana step to help make them
   more sturdy. Raisins feel slightly more virtuous, but chocolate chips
   feel slightly more delicious. Take your pick. Keep them small either
   way.

   I do not usually stock quick-cooking oats, but you can blitz
   old-fashioned oats in a food processor for a similar texture, or I’ve
   used Seven Sundays muesli with success (Target or Costco sell the big
   bags). If you need these to be nut-free, I have a report that sunflower
   butter works fine.

Ingredients

   1 medium, extra extra ripe banana, mashed
   1/2 tsp. sea salt
   1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
   1/2 tsp. cinnamon
   1/4 cup coconut oil, warmed
   1/4 cup maple syrup
   1/3 cup smooth, natural nut butter (almond, cashew, peanut)
   2 Tbsp. chia seeds
   1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats (or old-fashioned oats you’ve blitzed in
   the food processor a few times to get smaller bits)
   1/2 tsp. baking powder
   3 Tbsp. flaxmeal
   1/2 cup raisins (chop if they’re jumbo), or mini chocolate chips

Instructions

   In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed banana with salt, vanilla,
   cinnamon, coconut oil and stir to combine. Add the maple, nut butter,
   chia seeds and stir again until smooth. Let the chia seeds absorb for a
   moment.

   Stir in the oats, baking powder, flaxmeal, raisins and let the mixture
   chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350’
   and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment.

   Roll the dough into balls of about 2 Tbsp. worth of dough. Arrange them
   on the baking sheet with a little space between, give them a gently
   press down, they don’t spread much.

   Bake on the middle rack for 12-13 minutes. Remove to cool completely -
   they’ll hold together better once cooled.

   Store in an airtight container. Cookies will keep for three days.

Do you want to eat better?

     * Does meal planning feel like a chore?
     * Are you wasting money on unused groceries?
     * Do you ever stand in front of a fridge full of food and wonder,
       “How is there nothing to eat?”
     * Does it feel like you’re at the grocery store too often?
     * Are you bored of eating the same meals on repeat?
     * Do you struggle to feed picky eaters or different dietary
       preferences?

Developed from experience

   Over the years, through the journey of publishing Sprouted
   Kitchen, writing cookbooks, teaching classes,  contributing to
   magazines, and talking friends through weeknight dinner hangups, I've
   developed shortcuts and practices for cooking efficiently and well for
   my own family.

   With that in mind, we have set out to create Sprouted Kitchen Cooking
   Club, a program that will assist in getting people to the table with
   tasty, healthy-ish food in a simple and sustainable way.

What people are saying about Cooking Club

   "I just wanted to drop you a note to say how frickin excited I am about
   this! When I first read about it, I wasn't sure it would be for me, but
   decided to sign up anyway ... since I love your books so much. I work
   crazy hours, so I almost never cook during the week, so I didn't think
   this would click for me, but I was totally wrong!!
   I came home late last night from a crazy Labor Day weekend, really not
   in the mood to grocery shop, let alone cook. I have to say, I did not
   realize how much effort just THINKING about what I wanted to cook/buy
   took. By just going on auto pilot and buying what was on the list and
   cooking the first recipe, I got a great, much needed wholesome meal,
   and it felt SO EASY TO DO!! Not having to use my brain to
   think/organize just made all the difference in the world.
   Tacos are on the menu tonight - so excited to try the next recipe!!"

   Meg

   "What I like so much about this cooking club is the shopping list. I
   pretty much wing it when it comes to meals and often don't have the
   right ... ingredients with many last minute trips to the grocer, when I
   do plan it's generally for one meal. So it's awesome to do one trip to
   the market and have everything readily at hand for 3 meals and dessert
   to boot!" read more
   Marry

   "I am absolutely loving being a part of the cooking club! I joined week
   two and it’s definitely the best decision I’ve made for ... dinners.
   The way you cook is so up my alley - whole, fresh ingredients, lots of
   veggies, salads, bowls & sauces - YUM. So when you started the cooking
   club it was a no-brainer for me, I’ve seriously been having so much fun
   since I joined. My husband has been loving everything I’m making as
   well. I also have raved so much I’ve gotten both my mom & my sister to
   join.
   Added bonus - because I am buying such specific ingredients /
   quantities for the recipes - I find I am almost never throwing produce
   away at the end of the week (which is something I struggled with
   before) & our groceries are even a bit cheaper!” read more
   Micah

   "...Cooking Club has given me the boost I needed to get back on track
   and snowballed into other good habits! I feel better than I have in a
   long time and I’ve even lost a few ... pounds.
   All of this is to say, thank you, thank you! The recipes are easy to
   follow, the perfect amount of food for our family of four, and of
   course, delicious. You have even won over my skeptical husband who
   loves your seasonal approach. I love the tips you offer for leftovers,
   modifications, and kid-friendly approaches.
   Any chance you are considering developing an app for this? That would
   be icing on the cake!
   Again, thank you so much for all of your hard work and for sharing your
   gift with us! read more
   Maureen

   "I just wanted to say thank you. This is really the answer to my dreams
   and something I am so excited about starting. I get really stressed out
   by the planning process and as many times as I have tried to meal plan,
   I get overwhelmed and often spend way too much time trying to menu plan
   and make shopping lists etc. ... To be able to have that done for me
   was life changing. I would say that I saved two hours off of my weekend
   by not having to use any mental energy flipping through cookbooks and
   recipes and making grocery lists. Printing yours out is a game changer
   for me.
   The other exciting thing is that my receipt from Trader Joes was 87.70
   yesterday instead of the 150 plus that I usually spend on Sundays when
   I do my grocery shopping. Having a solid plan saved me over 60 dollars
   because I didnt buy things "just in case"- I bought what I knew I
   needed for your plan and that was it.
   I am really excited about joining the cooking club and wanted to thank
   you for doing this- it's something I am so excited about and am really
   looking forward to participating in each week. Thank you again!" read

Frequently Asked Questions
     __________________________________________________________________


How much does a Cooking Club membership cost?

   When you sign up for Cooking Club your first week is free, after which
   membership is $8.99 per month.
     __________________________________________________________________


How many recipes will I receive each week?

   Each weekly plan will provide four recipes - three meals and one treat
   or snack.
   I believe that three dinners at home is a reasonable number for the
   average home cook, who can then fill in other nights with their staple
   meals, going out, social plans and what not. Personally, I find five
   meals of planning to be too much, whereas three leaves room for plans
   changing, leftovers or a pizza and movie night should the mood strike.
     __________________________________________________________________


Recipes are free online, Sara.

   I know! Isn't that great? There is so much great content that it can
   even be too much for some of us. If you are organized and like the
   searching and pinteresting and list making and you have the skills to
   whip up a quick pan sauce with what you have on hand without a recipe,
   that’s great, and this program might not be ideal for you.  This is for
   the guy or gal who wants someone to help them simplify their meal
   planning, make dinner a little easier on them, and take a good chunk of
   mental bandwidth out of the weekly equation by answering: “What’s for
   dinner?”  My goal is to offer a very usable resource for people who
   want to eat better at home but, for one reason or another, could use a
   hand getting there.
     __________________________________________________________________


What kind of food can I expect?

   I eat a produce heavy diet, with seafood and poultry on occasion. I'm
   not overly concerned with labeling my food choices, but I know that is
   important for a program like this. I don't follow strict rules, but I
   do pay attention to what makes me feel good. I lean towards a
   mediterranean or anti inflammatory diet, where there is limited use of
   wheat, dairy and animal proteins, with wiggle room. I focus on using
   seasonal produce, healthy fats, legumes and nuts. Food choices should
   not be a game of "good" and "bad", you will see the substitutions for
   various diets in the recipe notes. You will catch on to my staple
   ingredients and adjust as necessary. This can be as simple as adding a
   grilled chicken breast to a vegetarian entree to up the protein content
   or leaving sausage out of a pasta dish if you prefer it vegetarian -
   either way, all notes will be there in the side bar so the plan works
   for your eating habits.
     __________________________________________________________________


Where will it go from here?

   I pivoted my plans from writing a third cookbook to this project, as I
   believe it may lead to a more communal place to cook alongside people.
   I want to lead people back to the dinner table. If there is enough
   interest, this could lead to an app, more video content, grocery lists
   that interface with delivery services that exist, recipes that can
   adjust for number of people serving, or a number of other potential
   features. We started a Facebook group so we can share ideas about what
   we swapped or did with the extra dressing. I am excited to chat with
   you, and help however needed, of course.

   I am also quite passionate about inviting people into our home
   - ordinary hospitality - and I think that has gotten away from us in
   the time of curated Instagram pages which sometimes discourage people
   from hosting, if they are not an amazing cook. Maybe once a month we
   can add one recipe that is written for closer to 8 people? I can give
   lots of make ahead tips so YOU will invite people over and I can walk
   you through getting a simple, vibrant dinner on the table.  I don't
   know! So many thoughts. We're starting this thing rather lean with the
   desire to refine and improve it based off of the feedback we get from
   real users. So while we may not be able to make shifts quickly, we are
   always open to your ideas.

MIXED BERRY OVERNIGHT OATS

   Sara Forte · August 19, 2019
   overnight-oats-01.jpg overnight-oats-01.jpg

   For my boy, the day before Kindergarten:

   This all felt like a lifetime away when you were teeny tiny and now,
   cliche as it sounds, it feels like it snuck up on me. Older folks will
   tell you ‘it goes by quickly,’ and when you are in those early years of
   parenting, it feels like no such pace. Yet, as we’re on the eve of the
   first day of kindergarten, and you’re trying on polo shirts and getting
   a larger lunchbox and reviewing how we handle conflict with friends
   that should maybe be a liiitttllleee less physical than how you bicker
   with your spicy little sister, and it truly does feel like a wildly
   quick, albeit full, five years.
   Nov 12, 2014 - 0727.jpg Nov 12, 2014 - 0727.jpg

   It likely all went unnoticed by you, but deciding where to put you for
   school this year has caused me all sorts of worry and stress and back
   and forth. Knowing that we have a choice in this shows immense
   privilege and I do not take that for granted. I hope one day you see
   that going to school with daily support from your teachers and parents
   to learn and grow is a gift not everyone gets. I will remind you of
   that when it feels hard to hustle out the door or do homework when you
   just want to play. I wanted to choose what would be best for you but I
   also see now that I was protecting myself, as well.

   Should we hold him back? He cries easily. He’ll be the youngest.

   Should we drive further to the better school? I want him to have
   friends close to our house.

   Do we do this or that Spanish immersion school? It will be frustrating
   for him, different, more difficult, he’ll be behind.

   I could talk myself into and out of each option on any given day. In
   the eleventh hour, we grabbed the last spot at the dual immersion
   school you are heading to and buddy, I feel really good about it.
   May 06, 2015 - 0319.jpg May 06, 2015 - 0319.jpg

   I am overly empathetic with you and your sister, and it is tough for me
   to rise above your emotions sometimes. As an adult, I hope that will
   read as an extension of my deep affection for you, but in these young
   years, I know that you look to me for stability. When you cry about
   getting a shot, I probably shouldn’t cry too ;) If you come home
   unhappy from school, I would blame myself for making the wrong choice,
   and I think I was trying to find some way to avoid that. But here is
   what a wise mentor reminded me: it is not my job as your parent to make
   everything easy and comfortable for you. A child who does not learn how
   to work through hard things themselves, how to rise to the occasion and
   figure things out, won’t have those necessary skills to handle
   difficult things as they grow up and out of our care.
   Jul 28, 2016 - 0976.jpg Jul 28, 2016 - 0976.jpg

   My job is to support and love you and encourage you - to protect you,
   yes, but not from a challenge. I want to step in when I see someone
   take your sand toy at the beach or your sister rages at you, but I also
   want you to be confident that YOU know how (or can learn how) to handle
   those circumstances on your own. It may not soak in until I am gone or
   you are a parent yourself, but I hope that you look back on your
   experience of me and see that I truly did the best I could to parent
   you. That doesn’t mean it will all look right by you, and I’ll be the
   first to say I’ve messed up, and will continue to, but I truly do
   delight in you. You are loved so completely by your family.
   Dec 15, 2017 - 1073.jpg Dec 15, 2017 - 1073.jpg

   I know that you are kind. I know that you are a good friend and will
   stick up for your people. I know that you want to be silly and make
   people laugh. I know that you are incredibly curious and so bright,
   Curran. From here on out, school will be a big part of your life and is
   just as much an education in people as it is in every other subject.
   Ask questions. Include people. Do your best. Choose grace. Speak up for
   yourself and others. “Cool” is temporary, “nice” leaves an actual
   impression - be nice.
   Home is always here. You will forever have a cheerleader in me. I love
   you so much, my baby.

   - Mommy

MIXED BERRY OVERNIGHT OATS

   Makes 6 small servings

   I admit I am not really a fan of cold oats, but my kids love these. I
   did not invent overnight oats, but these are the ratios we’ve been
   using for a creamy, pudding-like texture. It will looks thin at first,
   but that liquid is absorbed by the oats and chia to thicken the
   situation. My kids love carbs; but this adds some fiber and protein and
   healthy fats so they don’t have a blood sugar crash.

Ingredients

   1 1/2 cups nut or oat milk
   1 cup plain yogurt (dairy-free varieties work too!)
   2 Tbsp. ground flax
   2 Tbsp. chia seeds
   2-3 Tbsp. maple syrup
   1 tsp. vanilla extract
   1 1/4 cups old fashioned oats
   1/2 tsp. cinnamon
   pinch of salt
   1 lb. of mixed berries - blueberries, chopped strawberries, cherries
   etc.

for topping

   yogurt
   cocoa nibs
   toasted coconut
   toasted nuts
   granola

instructions

   In a large mixing bowl, combine the milk, yogurt, flax chia, maple and
   vanilla and stir well to combine. Add the oats, cinnamon, a big pinch
   of salt and mix. Stir in half of the berries. You could also just top
   with the berries, but I find my kids don’t try to pick at it if the
   berries are just non-negotiably in there.

   Transfer the overnight oats into portioned containers and pop them in
   the fridge for two hours or overnight.

   The next morning, garnish with remaining berries, more desired toppings
   and enjoy!
   Oat cups will keep in the fridge for 3-5 days.

                             LENTIL-CAULI TACO MEAT

   Sara Forte · July 30, 2019

   cauliflower and lentil tacos 'meat' cauliflower and lentil tacos 'meat'

   Ok. I had to double post on both SKCC and here because so many of you
   asked me for this recipe. The first time I made this, I was literally
   grasping at what was left in the fridge. It made a wet gross mush in a
   pot that I had no interest in eating, so I tried to save it by drying
   it out in the oven because I HATE wasting food. It had crispy edges and
   a deep tomato flavor and I ate it for three meals straight. To be
   honest with you, I cannot get it as good as it was the first time.
   Below is something pretty damn close.

   My family does eat meat, but in an effort towards sustainability and
   health, we eat a lot of vegetarian meals. Love a good mushroom taco, or
   even some saucy tempeh, but this mixture has the crumbly, spicy, crisp
   edges I remember from the ground beef tacos of my youth. Chili, sloppy
   joes, tacos, hamburger helper, any other babies of the 80’s know that
   dinner rotation?

   If you give it a whirl. Let me know your thoughts. I’ve used it in
   tacos, as shown, but also sprinkled it in a salad with avocado and
   peaches and pepitas, and put it in burritos for my wee ones. You could
   add rice and stuff it into bell peppers (there is a recipe in my story
   highlights). Anyway, you get the idea.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

LENTIL-CAULI TACO MEAT

   Makes about 4 cups / Serves 6

   If you need to cut a corner, use the steamed lentils from Trader Joes.
   I actually prefer them - they are drier than the ones I cook at home.
   Keep an eye on it while it’s in the oven, and stir it around. We want
   to dry it out to get some crunchy edges.

   Try it in tortillas with smashed avocado, cabbage and taco sauce below.

Quicky Taco Sauce

     * Blitz Together:
     * + 1 cup plain, whole greek yogurt
     * + 1 jalapeno
     * + 1 large garlic clove
     * + zest & juice of 1 lime
     * + small bunch cilantro
     * + salt & pepper

Ingredients

   2 Tbsp. avocado or extra virgin olive oil
   1/2 a yellow onion, roughly chopped
   3 garlic cloves
   1 (1.5 lb.) head of cauli, leaves and core removed, broken into florets
   (or 12 oz. fresh, not frozen, riced-cauli)
   3/4 tsp. Kosher salt/ 1/2 tsp. sea salt
   Fresh ground pepper
   1/2 tsp. cumin
   1 tsp. chili powder
   1 tsp. coriander
   1 cup canned tomato sauce (I like Muir Glen!)
   1 cup cooked lentils, drained

Instructions

   Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Preheat the oven to 400’ and
   line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment.

   Into a food processor, add the onions and garlic. Pulse a few times to
   chop well. Transfer to the pot with the hot oil and give it a quick
   stir. Put the cauli florets into the food processor and pulse, scraping
   down the sides every few times until it is in tiny rice-like pieces.
   Add it to the pot along with salt and pepper, sauté about 5 minutes
   until things soften and get golden in places.

   Add the cumin, chili powder, coriander (or about 1 Tbsp. taco
   seasoning) and stir. Add the tomato sauce and lentils, stir again.
   You’re going to think it looks like a soggy mess, but press on! Turn
   off the heat, let the mixture cool down.

   Transfer the cauli mixture to the prepared baking sheet and spread it
   in an even layer. Let all the steam off, then bake it in the upper
   third for 35 minutes, stirring once or twice during the baking time.
   Turn the oven up to 450’, and cook another 5-10 minutes. Turn off the
   oven, but leave the tray in there for another 10-15 minutes to dry it
   out further. The moisture level will be different per person because
   some cauli can be pretty watery, lentils can have different textures
   etc. It should look a little charred in spots. Stir it around to cool.

   Assemble as you wish - into a taco or roasted sweet potato or room temp
   into a taco salad. We didn’t make it super spicy so it would be
   kid-friendly too.

   Store covered in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze for up to a
   few months.

   chop well. Transfer to the pot with the hot oil and give it a quick
   stir. Put the cauli florets into the food processor and pulse, scraping
   down the sides every few times until it is in tiny rice-like pieces.
   Add it to the pot along with salt and pepper, sauté about 5 minutes
   until things soften and get golden in places.
   Add the cumin, chili powder, coriander (or about 1 Tbsp. taco
   seasoning) and stir. Add the tomato sauce and lentils, stir again.
   You’re going to think it looks like a soggy mess, but press on! Turn
   off the heat, let the mixture cool down.
   Transfer the cauli mixture to the prepared baking sheet and spread it
   in an even layer. Let all the steam off, then bake it in the upper
   third for 35 minutes, stirring once or twice during the baking time.
   Turn the oven up to 450’, and cook another 5-10 minutes. Turn off the
   oven, but leave the tray in there for another 10-15 minutes to dry it
   out further. The moisture level will be different per person because
   some cauli can be pretty watery, lentils can have different textures
   etc. It should look a little charred in spots. Stir it around to cool.
   Assemble as you wish - into a taco or roasted sweet potato or room temp
   into a taco salad. We didn’t make it super spicy so it would be
   kid-friendly too.
   Store covered in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze for up to a
   few months.

                           OATMEAL BREAKFAST COOKIES

   We have this “breakfast cookie” recipe going out to our Cooking Club
   members this week and I wanted to put the recipe here too. The feeding
   babies section is a crowd favorite, and my kids plow through these.
   Healthy-ish, grab n’ go, and what not - that’s what ya’ll seem to love
   about the kids recipes I’ve included around here. It’s tough to find a
   cookie or muffin that hold together that are both gluten and egg-free,
   but these work. Report back if you make them, or let me know what you
   changed. I love seeing your photos!

   Our son turned FIVE this weekend. It felt like a big birthday - every
   increment of five does to me for some reason. My mom always made a big
   deal of birthdays and I thought it was so fun - I love making him feel
   like the star of the weekend and the one to make all the calls. We
   packed the weekend with Legoland, camping with cousins in San Clemente,
   rocket launching in a field, Chuck-e-Cheese with grandparents, meals of
   his choice, sprinkle cupcakes etc. etc. It sounds like a lot because it
   was :)

   I feel like we were chin deep in both baby and toddler-hood at the same
   time for the past few years, and seeing Curran now as an
   almost-kindergartener is wild. Like we’ve been treading water, and now
   we can swim. He is thoughtful and emotional and smart and empathetic -
   LOVES his dad, lights up with the company of friends, is ALWAYS the
   first person to wake up in the morning with a full tank of energy, very
   into building things, collector, can recall specific memories in full
   detail from way before I thought was possible (“remember when I choked
   on that frozen mango?”…you were one, how do you remember that?!?!). He
   has figured out that throwing clothes in the hamper is quicker than
   folding and putting them away which I find both annoying and clever -
   for some reason it’s a nod from toddler to kid - those little things
   that feel different.

   Curran and I had a tough time with each other during his 2-4 age
   because he is pretty sensitive, and it would touch on an insecurity of
   my own - both of us then upset, neither bringing calm to the situation.
   I thought I was self-aware enough to not ride my toddlers emotions but
   I did… do, sometimes still. He’s better lately, and I am too, far from
   perfect, but it feels like we’ve grown in that area together. Perhaps
   that makes me sound like an immature parent, but little refines us and
   highlights our weak spots like our own children. Anyway, finding a
   better rhythm with him has been so special. I used to want time to
   speed up, I didn’t want to tread water anymore, but the swimming? Now I
   want to stop time! Curran and I have put together more lego sets in the
   past four days than I care to have floating around the house but he
   LOVES them, both the building and the company, so bring on the Legos.

   SIDENOTE: Hugh made a short pdf of quick food photography tips which is
   now available on our SHOP page. For a limited time, it is available for
   $1.99, which will be the best couple bucks you’ll spend this week. It
   is not a full photography course, but the concise and simple tips will
   absolutely make a difference in the way you capture your food. I’ve
   learned so much from Hugh, and this guide boils down the handful of
   important things to think about when you take and edit a photo of your
   food. Let us know if you have any questions!

OATMEAL BREAKFAST COOKIES

   Makes 18 small

   These are delicate, as there is no gluten or egg helping to bind them.
   If you are looking for something to pack in a lunchbox, and can
   tolerate eggs, add one in to the mashed banana step to help make them
   more sturdy. Raisins feel slightly more virtuous, but chocolate chips
   feel slightly more delicious. Take your pick. Keep them small either
   way.

   I do not usually stock quick-cooking oats, but you can blitz
   old-fashioned oats in a food processor for a similar texture, or I’ve
   used Seven Sundays muesli with success (Target or Costco sell the big
   bags). If you need these to be nut-free, I have a report that sunflower
   butter works fine.

Ingredients

   1 medium, extra extra ripe banana, mashed
   1/2 tsp. sea salt
   1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
   1/2 tsp. cinnamon
   1/4 cup coconut oil, warmed
   1/4 cup maple syrup
   1/3 cup smooth, natural nut butter (almond, cashew, peanut)
   2 Tbsp. chia seeds
   1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats (or old-fashioned oats you’ve blitzed in
   the food processor a few times to get smaller bits)
   1/2 tsp. baking powder
   3 Tbsp. flaxmeal
   1/2 cup raisins (chop if they’re jumbo), or mini chocolate chips

Instructions

   In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed banana with salt, vanilla,
   cinnamon, coconut oil and stir to combine. Add the maple, nut butter,
   chia seeds and stir again until smooth. Let the chia seeds absorb for a
   moment.

   Stir in the oats, baking powder, flaxmeal, raisins and let the mixture
   chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350’
   and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment.

   Roll the dough into balls of about 2 Tbsp. worth of dough. Arrange them
   on the baking sheet with a little space between, give them a gently
   press down, they don’t spread much.

   Bake on the middle rack for 12-13 minutes. Remove to cool completely -
   they’ll hold together better once cooled.

   Store in an airtight container. Cookies will keep for three days.
