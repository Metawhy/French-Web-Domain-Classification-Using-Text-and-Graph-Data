       U.S. Navy Machinist Mate First Class Fred M. Jones was 30 years old
       when he was killed on the USS Arizona, 07 Dec 1941. He joined the
       U.S. Navy in 1929. Until recently, he was interred in Hawaii with
       other unidentified casualties of the bombing. His remains were
       identified by the U.S. Navy and his body was brought back to
       Lakeside Cemetery in Port Huron, Michigan for burial on May 20,
       2017. People with American flags lined the route of the funeral
       procession along the St. Clair River. A large crowd gathered at the
       cemetery to pay their respects as Jones was buried with military
       honors.
