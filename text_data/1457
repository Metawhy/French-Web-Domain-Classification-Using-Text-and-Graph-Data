   Announcements

   by The Duchess and The Rabbit


   When Ryan and I were planning our wedding, we found there were
   surprisingly few resources for couples who wanted write their own
   ceremony, which is why I decided to share our wedding ceremony with you
   a few months ago. And though I love posting tons of visual inspiration
   and real wedding stories here on Snippet & Ink, I’d also love to
   provide inspiration for what’s really the most important part of the
   wedding day. So I’m calling on you to share your ceremony with us!


   If you’d like to submit your wedding ceremony for a Real Wedding
   Ceremony archive, shoot me an email with the following:

   – Subject Line: Ceremony
   – Full text of your ceremony, including readings, prayers, vows songs,
   blessings, etc. (see my post here for a guide)
   – Your wedding date and first names (optional)
   – A couple lines about your ceremony (optional)


   To answer some questions you might have:

   – Ceremonies will not be posted on the main page of the blog, but
   rather will be published on their own individual pages.
   – You can remain anonymous if you prefer, just let me know when you
   send your submission.
   – Details you might share about your ceremony include: What inspired
   you (religion, cultural traditions, family, literature, etc.)? What was
   important to you for your ceremony?
   – If you wrote your own vows, please only include them if you feel
   comfortable. Otherwise, just make note of the placement of your vows.
   – I will post an announcement on the blog when the ceremony archive
   goes live.


   Email ceremony submissions to kathryn@snippetandink.com. And if you
   have any questions, you can email me or leave them in the comments
   here. Can’t wait to hear from you!

       Thank you so much for this post. I’m feeling very lost about what
       to do for our ceremony in October. Thanks for all of the
       inspiration you shared from your own wedding, I’ve found it very
       helpful!

       Yes please! Like Anna, we are creating our own ceremony in October
       and is proving more difficult than originally thought. Would love
       to see more full ceremonies. Thank you!

Bi-Lingual Episcopal Wedding Ceremony with the Eucharist

   Wedding Ceremony of Anna Rebekah & Matthew Erik


   Processional
   Scherzino Mexicano by Manuel Ponce
   Performed by groom’s friend on classical guitar and bride’s on flute.


   Declaration of Consent / Declaracion de Consentimiento


   Ministry of the Word / Ministerio de la Palabra


   Readings:

   Genesis 1:26-28
   Then God said, ‘Let us make humankind in our image, according to our
   likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
   the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild
   animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon
   the earth.’  So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God
   he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them, and
   God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and
   subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the
   birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the
   earth.’

   1 Corinthians 13:1-13
   If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have
   love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic
   powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have
   all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am
   nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body
   so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. // Love is
   patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or
   rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or
   resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the
   truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
   endures all things. // Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they
   will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge,
   it will come to an end. For we know only in part, and we prophesy only
   in part; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end.
   When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I
   reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish
   ways. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to
   face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have
   been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and
   the greatest of these is love.

   Matthew 5:1-10
   When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat
   down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught
   them, saying:
   ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
   ‘Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
   ‘Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
   ‘Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
   will be filled.
   ‘Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
   ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
   ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
   ‘Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for
   theirs is the kingdom of heaven.


   Homily


   The Marriage / Matrimonio


   The Peace / La Paz


   The Eucharist / En la Eucaristia


   Prayer of Consecration


   The Lord’s Prayer
   Our Father, who art in heaven,
   hallowed be thy Name;
   thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
   on earth as it is in heaven.
   Give us this day our daily bread.
   And forgive us our trespasses,
   as we forgive those who trespass against us.
   And lead us not into temptation,
   but deliver us from evil.
   For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
   and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.


   Final Blessing


   Recessional
   From the bride: We had a Mariachi group surprise our guests (yes, even
   our bridal party) at the end of our ceremony when we kissed. I can’t
   remember the name of the song but it was a popular Marachi song. They
   led the guests up to our reception and played for our cocktail hour.
