   User Experience & more

   I’m seasoned user experience professional with 17 years of
   broad-ranging experience, I take a technology-focused, user-centric
   approach to solving business problems. I love to deep dive – understand
   the business landscape and how the consumer intersects, then ideating,
   creating, prototyping, and testing to bring the experience to life. I
   am inspired by dynamic collaboration and am comfortable conceptualizing
   with my team or presenting to stakeholders. Overall, I seek to elevate
   the importance of UX within the organization, evangelizing the value of
   good UX with colleagues, customers, and the community.

   This is my place on the internet to share my ideas and what I find
   interesting. I’ve just got this up and running, so it’s a little sparse
   at the moment.
