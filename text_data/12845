Department of Commerce Adds Dozens of New Huawei Affiliates to the Entity
List and Maintains Narrow Exemptions through the Temporary General License

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   Monday, August 19, 2019

   Office of Public Affairs

   (202) 482-4883
   publicaffairs@doc.gov

   WASHINGTON – Today, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the
   U.S. Department of Commerce identified 46 additional Huawei
   Technologies Co., Ltd. affiliates that require inclusion on the Entity
   List, as part of a routine review of all Entity Listings. Since May,
   the Department has added over one hundred persons or organizations to
   the Entity List in connection to Huawei. The new restrictions on these
   affiliates are effective today, August 19th.

   BIS has also announced that it will extend the Temporary General
   License (TGL) authorizing specific, limited engagements in transactions
   involving the export, reexport, and transfer of items – under the
   Export Administration Regulations (EAR) – to Huawei and its non-U.S.
   affiliates which are subject to the Entity List. The continuation of
   the TGL is intended to afford consumers across America the necessary
   time to transition away from Huawei equipment, given the persistent
   national security and foreign policy threat. This license will be
   effective on August 19, 2019 and last an additional 90 days.

   “As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s
   products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any
   disruption,” said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. “Simultaneously,
   we are constantly working at the Department to ensure that any exports
   to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the Entity
   Listing or Temporary General License.”

   Outside of the scope of the TGL, any exports, reexports, or in-country
   transfers of items subject to the EAR will continue to require a
   license granted after a review by BIS under a presumption of denial.

   Huawei was added to the Entity List after the Department concluded that
   the company is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national
   security or foreign policy interests, including alleged violations of
   the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), conspiracy to
   violate IEEPA by providing prohibited financial services to Iran, and
   obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those
   alleged violations of U.S. sanctions, among other illicit activities.

   The Bureau of Industry and Security’s mission is to advance U.S.
   national security and foreign policy objectives by ensuring an
   effective export control and treaty compliance system and promoting
   continued U.S. strategic technology leadership. BIS is committed to
   preventing U.S.-origin items from supporting Weapons of Mass
   Destruction (WMD) projects, terrorism, or destabilizing military
   modernization programs. For more information, please visit
