   Rachel Adler
   byRachel Adler 4 years ago

   There are countless things I love about working in the beauty
   industry—always having the inside track on the hottest new products,
   the life-long friendships I’ve cultivated, an endless supply of
   lipsticks—and I wouldn’t trade my job for anything in the world. But
   when I signed up for this, no one told me that I’d also be putting my
   own looks under a microscope, day after day, just as a natural
   side-effect of the job.

   While it may seem kind of vain, I’ve become downright obsessive—and
   more than a little critical—of my skin. That’s hard to admit,
   especially since the beauty industry is about helping people look and
   feel their best. And yet it’s hard not to be your own worst critic.
   Some of the people I work with day to day have literally flawless skin,
   and it’s difficult not to compare yourself to perfection. As I sit
   through endless conferences on new dermatological breakthroughs, the
   devastating yet ever-growing numbers of skin cancer and—ugh—the
   perceived horrors of aging, I can only turn all of those statistics on
   myself, comparing and contrasting how “well” I’m doing with my own
   skin.

   This has to led to something like a beauty-related psychotic break. I’m
   constantly examining each of my freckles, asking every dermatologist in
   sight if it’s skin cancer (better safe than sorry, right?). I inspect
   my cheeks every day to see if they’re losing that coveted plumpness of
   youth. And visible signs of aging? Forget about it, I’m terrified.

   But as I edge ever closer to 30, I’m forced to admit it: my skin has
   changed, and the wrinkles I’ve dreaded for so long have appeared on my
   face. Though my rational brain knows that I won’t degrade into a
   shriveled-up husk, the panicky, perfection-obsessed part of my mind is
   a little afraid that, y’know, THAT MIGHT REALLY HAPPEN. So how am I
   dealing with this deep-rooted beauty crisis? Therapy? Meditation? A
   bottle of wine?

   No, I choose to deal with my issues via the time-honored tradition of
   GIFs. Here is my journey through the Valley of Wrinkle Acceptance—as
   told in reaction GIFs.

   So I see my first wrinkle (or imagine it) and apply layers and layers
   of skin creams, because five has to be better than one, right?

   I ask every single person in sight if they see a crease on my forehead.
   Do you see it now? When I wrinkle it up is it there?
   giphy.com / reddit.com

   giphy.com / reddit.com

   I debate how much I’ll need to give up to afford the cost of Botox. A
   smaller apartment is worth a wrinkle-free face, right?
   giphy.com / www.hungrymeetshealthy.com

   Also, if Botox goes wrong, I think of my back-up plans. Real
   Housewives? Botched?

   Every time I pass a mirror (even if it’s simply a reflective elevator)
   I check for new wrinkles.

   I apply coconut oil over my entire face, because coconut oil cures
   everything. I then feel extremely greasy so quickly scrub everything
   off and immediately regret my decision.
   giphy.com / realitytvgifs.tumblr.com

   I look up home remedies for wrinkles (because there’s a DIY for
   everything) and apply bananas to my face.

   Cannot. Stop. Looking. In. The. Mirror. Cancel plans with friends to
   examine my face. Yes, I’ve officially gone off the deep end.

   I drink away my sorrows with wine, because that’s the answer for
   everything in life. Wine cures wrinkles, right?

   I eventually give up, and give in. Wrinkles may have won this round,
   but the battle goes on…I’ll find a new product and a new way to defeat
   you, wrinkle demon.
