                         Decorating Homemade Dog Treats

   [Decorating%2BHomemade%2BDog%2BTreats.jpg]
   Our current FAQs, Tips, and Troubleshooting mini-series is all about
   DIY dog treats and today we're talking about decorating homemade dog
   treats. Baked biscuits can be made and decorated in such a wide variety
   of styles that we split this treat type into three separate posts:
   our introduction to making homemade baked biscuit (cookie) style dog
   treats, today's decorating details, and our follow-on shelf-life and
   storage post to close out the mini-series.

                   Homemade Baked Biscuit (Cookie) Dog Treats

   Dalmatian dog in front of oven full of baking homemade dog treats.
   Our current FAQs, Tips, and Troubleshooting mini-series is all about
   DIY dog treats, and we had so many delicious things to share that we
   extended the mini-series into this week so that baked biscuit (cookie)
   dog treats could get the extra special treatment (sorry...couldn't help
   myself!) this category of homemade dog treats deserve as one of the
   most popular and varied types of treats. Today's post is an
   introduction to making biscuit treats, and then we'll look at
   shelf-life/storage and decorating in their own dedicated posts to wrap
   up the mini-series.
