Matting Little Works of Art

   [CitrineForest-c.jpg]
   Citrine Forest
   by Artist Rita Squier
   Original Watercolor Painting
   Size: 2.5 x 3.5 inches
   Matted: 8x10 inches
   ACEO
   I have decided to add a mat to some of my little original watercolor
   ACEO art card paintings.  The paintings are 2.5 x 3.5 inches and the
   mat size is 8x10 inches.  This makes them easier for you to purchase
   and add your own frame and hang on your wall.  I am also giving you the
   option of a black or white mat.
   I have begun to add quite a few of my little watercolors that have
   never been listed for sale before online or in my Etsy shop.  The plan
   is to add at least a few each day.  Drop by my Squier Etsy Shop to see
   more of these little treasures.
   It's just a click away: squier.etsy.com
   ACEO = Art Cards, Editions & Originals always 2.5 x 3.5 inches.
   Most of my ACEOs are little original watercolor paintings.

   by Artist Rita Squier
   Original Watercolor Painting
   Each One Size: 2.5 x 3.5 inches
   ACEO
   The Splat Series!  A set of 3 little abstract watercolor paintings.  A
   blast or splat from the past.  These little ACEO sized paintings were
   done in 2009.  I have decided to put them up for sale in my Squier Etsy
   Shop as a set.
   This was a fun little experiment in abstract painting.

Dusting Off My Techniques

   [010518-Tranquility-b.jpg]
   Tranquility
   by Artist Rita Squier
   Original Watercolor Painting
   Size:  8x10 inches (cropped a bit)
   Fresh off the art board, this precious little watercolor painting.
   It is a bit late in the evening, the sun has set. I attempted to take
   this photo with an iPad Mini and edited the colors to look as best I
   could on my computer screen simply using the Preview program.  It is a
   close representation of the piece!
   Tomorrow, with proper natural light I will retake the photo and add
   this new painting to my rasquier.com website.
   I painted this little painting on an 8x10 piece of 300 lb. Waterford
   paper that I found kicking around my studio.  I do love to paint on 300
   lb. paper, it handles the water and the paint differently than a 140
   lb. piece of watercolor paper.  You have more time to play with the
   color and techniques because the paper stays wet longer.  Plus I pulled
   out my Series 7 Winsor Newton brush, it has an awesome point to create
   that fabulous tree with the thin wispy branches.

Love Watercolor Painting

   [010318-NewBeginning-c.jpg]
   New Beginning
   by Artist Rita Squier
   Original Watercolor Painting
   Size: 9x12 inches
   Today's newest watercolor painting!
   New Beginning is a fantastic title for this little wonder.  I have not
   painted all too often for the past year.  I did hand paint my Christmas
   cards which perhaps sparked my interest in watercolor painting again.
   I do absolutely love to paint especially in watercolor a rather
   challenging medium.
   Hopefully this fresh start and new beginning will continue and I will
   be back to doing what I love doing best.  Painting watercolors,
   experimenting in other mediums and also teaching and giving out
   watercolor painting tips.

Happy New Year 2018

   [010218-FreshStart-b.jpg]
   Fresh Start
   by Artist Rita Squier
   Original Watercolor Painting
   Size:  8x10 inches
   Happy New Year Everyone!
   I have decided to give my painting, my website and my blog a brand new
   fresh start for 2018.  I cleared off my easel and created this lovely
   little watercolor painting today.  Then proceeded to figure out how to
   add it to my website.
   Updating my website has become a challenge.  I have been trying my best
   to learn how to use Adobe Dreamweaver pretty much all Summer, Autumn
   and now this Winter I am going to master it!  I was so good at using
   Adobe GoLive.  For me, it was quick and simple to use because I knew it
   so well.  I had been using it for years!  However, the program had
   become outdated and extinct.  The program and my desktop no longer
   wanted to talk to the internet.  Too many other things in life had
   gotten in the way of my art.  I have decided to give myself and my art
   a Fresh Start.  Learning and updating the art and design things I keep
   putting on the back burner, my website, my blog.  I myself need to be a
   priority along with some of the things that make me happy.  The number
   one thing that makes me happy is creating art.
   2018 will be filled with more art, more watercolors and more
   creativity.
   And more blogging!

ACEO - Art Cards Editions and Originals

   [RASquier-MahjongTiles.jpg]
   Mahjong Tiles
   by Artist Rita Squier
   ACEO
   Giclée - Fine Art Print
   Size:  2.5 x 3.5 inches
   What is an ACEO?
   The letters in ACEO stand for Art Cards, Editions and Originals.
   The Art Card Originals are handmade one at a time.  They can be created
   in any medium such as watercolor, oil paint, acrylics, pen and ink,
   multi-media, collage and the list goes on.
   The Art Card Editions are prints.  They can be open ended editions and
   sometimes they are limited edition prints.  The printing method can
   vary as well.
   The main requirement of the ACEO or ATC is the size.  They are always
   2.5 x 3.5 inches.  They are the same size as trading cards, like
   baseball cards.  They are kind of a trading card for artists.  They are
   called Artist Trading Cards or ATC when traded amongst artists.  They
   are considered ACEOs when they are sold to artists and collectors.
   Collecting ACEOs whether they are originals or prints is an excellent
   way to start an affordable art collection!  They are small and often
   times not very expensive.
   I love to create ACEOs!

Julia's Cross a Memorial to My Mom

   [JuliaCross8x10-c.jpg]
   Julia's Cross
   by Artist Rita Squier
   A watercolor painting I created in memory of my Mom who recently passed
   away in November.  The watercolor is so beautiful and meaningful, I
   wanted to be able to share it with others.  I had fine art giclée
   prints made.  The paper is Somerset Velvet.  It has the look and feel
   of watercolor paper.  The prints have turned out so nice it looks like
   a real watercolor painting.
   If you would like a copy of this beautiful spiritual print, you can
   find Julia's Cross as an 8x10 inch print in my Squier Etsy Shop.  Also
   available are 5x7 inch prints with or without a mat in my Squier Etsy
   Shop.

New Prints for 2017

   [CrossPrints.jpg]
   My newest endeavor to start off 2017 are giclée prints.  These prints
   were made from watercolor paintings I created in memory of my Mom Julia
   and my Aunt Viola.  Two very wonderful ladies who will always be very
   dear to me.
   The new prints are currently available in my Squier Etsy Shop.  Both
   styles are done in 5x7 and 8x10 inch.  I offer the 5x7 prints matted
   and ready for you to frame in a standard 8x10 frame.
   They can be found in the Giclée - Fine Art Prints Section of my Squier
   Etsy Shop.

New Backdrop for My Art

   [background.jpeg]
   I was trying to figure out what I could use for a new backdrop for my
   watercolor paintings that I put up on Etsy for sale.  I tried looking
   around the house to see if I had a cool new spot I could use to
   photograph my art.  A new spot that also had great natural light.
   I decided my original spot to photograph my art was the best.  It has
   great lighting, if I can get to it at the right time of day with the
   right amount of sunshine.  Works like a charm every time.
   I wanted a more creative backdrop than just the wall or just a plain
   white canvas panel.  As I was searching for little paintings to add to
   my Studio SALE I found an unfinished background for a painting.  It was
   blue.  I used that for a few paintings.  But I had a lot of trouble
   getting the blue in one of the paintings to photograph properly.
   A day or two later, I came up with the perfect solution!  I would use
   the backside of the blue background painting.  It is an awesome 300 lb.
   half sheet of 100% cotton rag archival watercolor paper.  I decided to
   paint a new backdrop with neutral colors!  I wanted to keep it pale and
   simple.  I used Carbon Black and Neutral Tint.  I added a few splatters
   of clear water and a few splatters of my two colors.  I must admit I am
   very pleased with my result!
   I photographed a few of my Studio SALE paintings and I do think they
   turned out pretty good.  Pop on over to my Squier Etsy Shop and take a
   look.  You may find a cute little painting you just have to buy!

8 Years on Etsy

   [5x7s-2.jpg]
   Today marks my
   8th Etsy-versary!
   I have now been selling my art and more on Etsy for eight years.  I
   have sold paintings and shipped them all over the world.  It is
   wonderful to be able to say I have paintings in collections through the
   USA, Canada, all over Europe, even South America, Australia, Asia,
   including Brunei.
   Today, I have created a Studio SALE section in my Squier Etsy Shop.
   The prices are incredible, if you like a painting snap it up quick!  I
   am not sure just how long I will keep the prices low.
   The Studio SALE section has a quite a few watercolor sketches and fun
   quick paintings and I plan on adding more and more each day this week.
   A big thank you to all those who have purchased my art, my designs and
   my artisan crafts over the years!  -- Sincerely, - Rita

Day 28 Painting A Day

   Misty Sunset
   by Artist Rita Squier
   Original Watercolor Painting
   Size: 5x7 inches
   Sometimes you think you have a bright and brilliant sky and then the
   watercolor paint dries back a lot more than you expected.  It is one of
   the many tricky qualities of watercolor painting.
