   Since 1926, driving down Route 66 has been the experience of a lifetime
   for travelers, adventurers, desperados, and dreamers. The Historic 66
   website provides free information for all those who want to learn more
   about the legendary Route 66.

   While officially Route 66 no longer exists, the majority of it remains
   to be driven and enjoyed. The turn-by-turn road description will guide
   you on your journey through all eight states from Chicago to Los
   Angeles. Not only will it help you to stay on track, but you’ll also
   find some background information on the hundreds of roadside
   attractions that dot the landscape.

   In the picture gallery, you'll find inspiration for your upcoming
   voyage or take a trip down memory lane. Thanks to the preservation
   organizations, volunteers, and business owners, a lot of these
   landmarks can still be admired in real life along Route 66. Some
   treasures, however, have disappeared and can only be explored through
   pictures.

   Are you ready for the big adventure and start building your very own
   memories? Current roadmaps and GPS systems are poor at indicating where
   Route 66 ran and signs can be spotty or even missing all too often.
   Hence, you will need a detailed map and guide before hitting the road
   and getting your kicks on Route 66!

   25 The website is celebrating its 25^th anniversary in 2019!
