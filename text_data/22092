Our Philosophy

Clean, Natural Food should Taste Good!

   Like most kids, I grew up eating processed, convenient foods (that are
   terrible for your health). When I went to college, I decided it was
   time for a change. I wanted to look good and feel good about my body,
   but didn’t know what foods I should be eating. After years of research,
   I created Papa Steve’s with one goal in mind – to make a clean,
   healthy, high-protein bar that’s made fresh and actually tastes good!

   Our Mission is simple: To Inspire people to live healthy, happy lives
   by offering great tasting, no junk nutrition, made from real
   ingredients.

We Believe ...

     * That truly great tasking foods are the ones made with real
       ingredients.
     * In the wholesome power of Mother Nature's raw ingredients.
     * That handmade food is what our body really needs. No processed
       foods, no preservatives, no candy power bars.
     * That you should not have to compromise your health to have a
       convenient food.

   Worth the Money

   I recommend buying directly from Papa Steve's . This is my second
   order, my first order from Amazon took longer and shelf life shorter.
   These bars are by far the best protein bars on the market. Worth the
   extra $. Excellent source of protein, low sugar and taste great.
