A unique name for a unique university

   Mines is different, but it just may be perfect for you.
   [mclimb.jpg]

   Colorado School of Mines has, since our founding in 1874, been a bit
   different. We were built to give the West, the world and emerging
   industries the knowledge and talent required to power the 19th and
   20th centuries (and beyond).

   Not much has changed in the nearly 150 years since. We‚Äôre still closely
   aligned with‚Äîand committed to meeting‚Äîindustry and societal needs by
   preparing graduates who can contribute, adapt and lead in a constantly
   changing world.

   What else hasn‚Äôt changed? Our name. We remain a place dedicated to
   hands-on practice (thus the ‚ÄúSchool‚Äù) and committed to digging deep
   (‚Äúmining‚Äù) for answers to the world‚Äôs pressing challenges. If that
   makes us sound and look a bit different‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs nothing new
   either.
