Frequently asked questions

   (BUTTON) What are Eligibility Requirements?

          + You will use the account primarily for business purposes.
          + You’re not already an N26 user.
          + You reside in a country where N26 operates: Germany, Austria,
            France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece, the
            Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Finland, Latvia, Estonia,
            Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland

   (BUTTON) Is N26 Business free?
          N26 Business is free to open online with no account management
          fees. It’s the easiest business bank account to open if you’re a
          freelancer or you’re self-employed.

   (BUTTON) Should I open the account with my personal name or with my
          business name?
          To sign up for N26 Business you have to use your personal name
          and last name. The N26 Business account is designed for
          self-employed and freelance users doing business under their own
          name. That means you can’t have your company’s name on the
          account or card.

   (BUTTON) Can I have a regular N26 bank account and an N26 Business
          account at the same time?
          It’s possible to do business banking and spending with your N26
          Business Mastercard and personal spending with your additional
          Maestro card on the same account. However, it’s currently not
          possible to have two separate N26 accounts at the same time.

   (BUTTON) How do I get my cashback on Mastercard purchases?
          Since N26 Business is an online business bank account, you’ll
          receive your 0.1% cashback on all Mastercard purchases directly
          into your account. It will automatically be deposited at the end
          of every quarter. You don’t have to take any additional steps!

   (BUTTON) What happens if I use my N26 Business account for personal
          spending?
          The N26 Business bank account makes it easy to do personal
          spending on the same account if you have both the Mastercard and
          Maestro cards that are easily available from the app. As long as
          you use the Mastercard for business spending and the Maestro
          card for personal spending, you can continue to enjoy the many
          advantages of the account.
