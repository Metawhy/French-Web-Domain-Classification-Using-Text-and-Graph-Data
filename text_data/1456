       Axiom Verge for those who like Metroidvania games. 84 Metacritic
       Battlezone a game I think can now be played without VR since a
       recent patch albeit full price is too much lead to mixed reviews.
       Darkest Dungeon had the blogcast and especially Sid addicted for
       weeks, I got addicted as well. 84%
       Firewatch a narrative based experience 81%
       Flower a palette cleanser experience 91%
       Hohokum a game/experience that holds an odd niche. 75%
       Journey a game that put President Shuhei Yoshida in tears 92%
       N++ A game with thousands of levels/challenges 82%
       Ratchet and Clank needs no introduction. 85%
       Risk of Rain the more you play the harder and crazier it gets, tons
       of crazy. 81%
       Rogue Legacy a challenging time and time again until you get the
       hang of risk/reward/mastery 85%
       Soma. SOOOOMAAAA Sci-fi horror game and favorite syllables for the
       Podcast. 84%
       Last of Us from the genius of Naughty Dog. 95%
       Unfinished Swan an interesting emotional story/puzzle experience
       about loss and grief. 83%
       Transistor another genius games from the people who made Bastion,
       Pyre, and well the middle child Transistor. 83%
       None of these games are bad. Some more niche’ than others. Maybe
       grab something new. I have all but 2.

       @MakaiOokami
       I don’t think that’s correct. I’m pretty sure Battlezone VR still
       requires VR for the entire game. There is no NON-VR mode.
     * MakaiOokami
       08/23/2017 at 11:29 am
       I guess you’re right drd7of14.
       I guess it was Eve Valkyrie Warzone that’s getting patched to no
       longer require VR. You can see how the mistake was made. Warzone
       Battlezone. I’ve got VR so it wasn’t something I was really paying
       attention to. Thanks for the correction. I thought a non VR patch
       was why someone decided to make it their pick for the discount.

       You’ve got Journey, Rogue Legacy, Ratchet and Clank, the Last of
       Us, and Transistor.
       You’ve got 1/3 of the games up there…
       Gotta ask why Darkest Dungeon and Risk of Rain aren’t on your
       collection. If you liked Tharsis you’ll probably like Darkest
       Dungeon IMO.

       Pretty sure you are just admitting to having terrible opinions and

   Axiom Verge – Own it, very good metroidvania heavily inspired by metro
   game. It’s getting a limited physical release. Recommend it!
   Darkest Dungeon – Currently one of my favorite indie games atm. This
   game is a fun dungeon-esque crawler with heavy emphasis on sanity. It’s
   new DLC Crimson Court just released today too so worth the pick up.
   Firewatch – Audio in this game is amazing, relaxing sounds of the
   forests draw you in. The communication between the two main characters
   is astounding.
   Flower – Everyone knows what this one is, just a simple game for
   relaxation and calming.
   Hohokum – Weird game, played it a few times and never went back.
   Journey – Well known, no need to say anything about it.
   Ratchet & Clank – Awesome remake
   The Last Of Us Remastered – Need I say anything about this masterpiece
   Transistor – GET THIS TITLE NOW!

   Prices of these games still seem high to me. 67 percent off or more
   would of did the trick for me to pick some of these up. Been wanting
   soma and firewatch for some time now.

   Pretty terrible sale considering its only 33% on only 15 games. Some
   good games here dont get me wrong but they have been at better prices
   before or free on PS+. Suspect decision making whoever decided to ok
   this.

       I agree that it’s pretty terrible. Why make a discount code that’s
       only good for 15 games? Why did they not publish the games WITH THE
       33% DISCOUNT ALREADY ON? I mean, buyers could have very well
       purchased the games already and not get a discount if they’re not
       aware of the code…

   Congrats on 10 years and a thank you to the entire blog team for always
   keeping me and others on here updated. Few great games in there, though
   I have the ones I would want already. Still a extra sale is great for
   everyone on the blog though some don’t deserve it.

   that list in your cart?

   jump on that to finally play it on my PS Vita.

   Tatanka2007
   08/23/2017 at 1:51 am

   Definitely rather weak since many titles have either been free with
   Plus or have had far better discounts. I suspect that they will have
   better discounts again in the future too.

   Still I gotta admit that Rachet and Clank is so much fun and looks even
   better on PS4 Pro. I think regular digital is only $20, so get it!

       Better than the current presidency. I’ll be just happy if the
       current president doesn’t cause Japan or Korea to get nuked off the
       face of the Earth…
       Now THOSE are low expectations. Let’s not get all the great games
       we want from TGS to be wiped out by 2 madmen who need a diaper
       change and the t.v. constantly on telling them that they aren’t
       sad, losers, with no good qualities and money gotten by stealing
       from all those they look down on thanks to their father being
       powerful and dying leaving undeserved power vacuum that they then
       got sucked into.

   Happy 10 year downward spiral!
   I don’t know about the vast majority, but I would gladly give up these
   “sales”, and have much more excitement and enthusiasm if the old
   PlayStation Store update format came back. Alas, we know that’s not
   happening, so cheers!



   Fuhr31
   08/23/2017 at 4:14 pm

   the problem with PS Store is that sales are based on inflated base
   prices. Older games need a permanent price drop like you see in retail,
   then we can talk about sales. When the sales at best only bring prices
   down to what you see everyday in retail, then they arent really sales
   at all.

   FWIW Transistor is the highlight of my PS+ subscription, in that it was
   both not on my radar at all and turned out to be one of my favorite
   games on the system. I’ll probably be nabbing Firewatch and cleaning up
   my wishlist a bit.

   Hello everyone! It’s Alex Bravve from Nordcurrent here. Today, I’m
   going to talk about our upcoming PSP game, available on PSN only –
   101-in-1 Megamix. It will be released on September 20 in North America
   and on September 22 in Europe.

   As many of you have already guessed, 101-in-1 Megamix is a collection
   of 101 mini-games in different genres, ranging from arcade and puzzles,
   to space racing and cooking.

   101-in-1 Megamix PSP 101-in-1 Megamix PSP

   The game is structured as a series of humorous TV shows about
   underwater world, music, cooking, etc. So there is an unprecedented
   variety in visuals and game worlds. This is one of the few games that
   can take you from the Wild West to the space and from Paradise Islands
   to the fancy restaurants.

   101-in-1 Megamix PSP (2) 101-in-1 Megamix PSP (2)

   Some of the games are based on well-known classics, and it will be easy
   to get an idea of where the inspiration came from.

   101-in-1 Megamix PSP (5) 101-in-1 Megamix PSP (5)

   However most of the games are completely original. We had lots of ideas
   about fun gameplay and fun visuals that wouldn’t work as standalone
   projects, but would be really fun as a wacky mini-game. Here we were
   able to choose the best ones and finally do them. Hope you will enjoy
   them.

   101-in-1 Megamix PSP (1) 101-in-1 Megamix PSP (1)

   There are several game modes in 101-in-1 Megamix. The most important is
   TV Guide Mode – this is where you progress further into the game,
   unlock new games (only 15 of them are unlocked in the very beginning),
   get bonuses, etc.

   101-in-1 Megamix PSP (3) 101-in-1 Megamix PSP (3)

   More than a dozen of games have an ad-hoc multiplayer. So you can grab
   your family or a friend, and enjoy this mayhem together. There are two
   multiplayer modes in 101-in-1 Megamix – an ordinary Multiplayer mode,
   and a Marathon mode. In Marathon mode, you are given a list of five
   randomly assigned games, you have to complete all five of them, and the
   one who’s earned more points in all five is the winner.

   101-in-1 Megamix PSP (6) 101-in-1 Megamix PSP (6)

   101-in-1 Megamix is suitable for all ages, and it will be as fun to
   play for your children or parents, as it is for you. And did I say
   about the value for money?:) If you divide $14.99 by 101, it turns out
   that you pay less than 15 cents for a game. I don’t think any other
   game can beat us on PSP. :)

   101-in-1 Megamix PSP (4) 101-in-1 Megamix PSP (4)

   Thanks for reading this and hope you will enjoy this game! For more
   information on our games you can visit our studio website or our
   Facebook page.

       try!



   Bcrichmark
   09/20/2010 at 2:58 pm

   I’d buy that for a dollar! OH they want 15 well never mind then ill
   pass. Whats with the price hike in games lately most new psn download
   games use to cost 10 bucks but ever since rachet quest for booty came
   out alot of others think 15 bucks is ok. In my opinion the rachet game
   was a more refined, with retail quality to it and deserves the 15 buck
   price tag. alot of the 15 dollar games on psn now need to be no more
   than 10 bucks. You Would Think with a poor Economy and lots of
   Competition with micro game makers out there that you would want to
   keep yours more attractive by keeping it cheaper.

       If it was sold at retail, it would cost $29.99, but since it is
       sold on PSN, we are offering it at $14.99, which I believe is a
       good deal.



   vernSL
   09/20/2010 at 3:16 pm

   Looks like it could be fun. $15 isn’t a lot for a game, especially one
   with what seems like a lot of content. I’ll probably wait for a review
   first, but it looks like it might be pretty fun. Mini games are great
   for portable systems. We need some videos of it in action though!

   I love all these little kids or losers working minimum wage jobs who
   keep complaining about the price of games. Like 14.99 is a lot of money
   to spend. LOL!

   I am buy Deathspank, Sonic, Blade Kitten and the RDR DLC without
   hesitation nor worrying about how much they cost. Good games are good
   games, regardless of the price.

   If you are having to calculate if its worth the purchase down to the
   penny, you should not be playing games…but rather talking to a
   financial advisor…or working another job. LOL!

   I guess they forgot about Work Time Fun having a whole lot of games,
   plus downloadable addons.

   @17 “I love all these little kids or losers working minimum wage jobs
   who keep complaining about the price of games. Like 14.99 is a lot of
   money to spend. LOL!”

   Hey man, $15 is a lot of money to me and I am a relativity high earner.
   I got a wife and two kids to take care of… just because you have no
   damned overhead in your life doesn’t mean you can trot around on your
   high horse and belittle everyone else.

   Funny thing is, I laugh at people like you who have nothing else of
   value to spend your hard earned money on. The rest of us calculate
   where best to spend our money (AFTER mortgage, car payments and living
   costs) and not squander it on anything waved under our noses.

   Pfft, you probably live with mummy and daddy still and don’t even know
   what the real value of money is yet.

   @ #20

   Wrong. I don’t have car payments because I paid off both of mine. I
   live in an apartment and have living costs just as you do. I don’t have
   a nagging wife or bratty kids…so that puts me up above you.

   However 14.99 is still NOT A lot of money. I pay that usually for lunch
   on a monday to friday daily basis. I really am tired of all these
   whiners complaining about the cost of games. You guys want handouts
   like a bunch of bums.

   Interesting concept – Mario Party comes to the PSP. The only problem,
   or concern, I have is the locked games – that drives me batty. In this
   case, there are 101 mini games but only 15 are available at the start!
   I utterly hate that. This is the type of game that I want to just pick
   up and go for the odd 10 or 15 minute breaks I may have during the
   course of the day. I dont want to have to sit down and objectively work
   for hours unlocking things. Just unlock everything at once and let me
   play what I want to play.

   PS – Screenshots are lovely, but lets show a video of actual game play
   so that we can see how this really looks on the PSP.

       Thank you TripG! Unlocking the games is actually part of the fun.
       Once you complete a game, it unlocks another two, so you wouldn’t
       get stuck. And here is the video:

   Hey, I’m not starting a ‘flame war’.. I just can’t let pretentious
   comments like that slide. I don’t care how much he pays for his lunch…
   the PS community come from various income levels and shouldn’t be
   called “little kids or losers” just because they decide something is to
   expensive for them.

   I’m happy for you if you think $15 is nothing, if you really can just
   buy whatever you like regardless of the price then good for you. You
   are part of the problem, if people you continue to pay $15 for PSN
   games then they will needlessly stay at $15.

   I love mini-game collections on the PSP! Work Time Fun is among my
   favorite games on the PSP Go currently! I’ll definately be downloading
   this game as soon as I get another PSN Card! It looks like a LOT of
   fun, and there’s nothing better than a fun, quirky, mini-game
   collection to play in between Monster Hunter Freedom Unite sessions!

   You just said Sonic was a good game? What games in the series have been
   good since the Genesis days?

   Therefore, I’ve come to the conclusion you just buy anything cuz it’s
   there, which is the reason dev’s charge $15 per game. Because they can.

   I submit an idea to the PS.Share blog every day, and many dont get
   posted. They dont tell me why. But when stuff like “Add a Super
   NINTENDO” emulator gets added it’s very disheartening to see things you
   cant possible do get chosen over my legitimate ideas.

   Can you please force them to tell us why our ideas dont get posted and
   show where are ideas are in the queue to be read?

   To say that I am ashamed of the PlayStation community I am a part of
   right now would be an understatement. Such disrespectful, arrogant and,
   in the first several comments, ignorant commenting is absolutely
   disgusting. (The rush to be the “first” brings out the idiots without
   fail) Sadly, it’s been heading in this downward spiral for awhile now.

   My sincerest apologies.

   Sadly, it seems by placing a full game in the same price range as PSN
   minigames, many are equating the two. Honestly, I think setting it
   initially at a $30 price-point and then striking that price down to $15
   would have garnered more attention. Those graphics are actually quite
   impressive for the PSP. It’s easy to forget what PSP games looked like
   3 years ago. Actually, now that I think about it, the fact that they
   thought it looked like a cheap PS3 game is more of a compliment than an
   insult.

   Thanks for stopping by and for keeping such an upbeat attitude.

   Today’s the day — Dead Star is launching on PS4 and it’s free for
   PlayStation Plus members this month!

   Before you start your journey towards becoming the galaxy’s greatest
   pilot, we wanted to throw some tips your way.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSKuYI2i64A

   Dead Star is a 10-on-10 multiplayer shooter set on the fringes of known
   space, where teams of outlaws and scavengers fight for survival in a
   galactic prison known as The Wastes. Dead Star incorporates features
   from multiple modern genres, including RPGs and MOBAs, while remaining
   true to its roots in arcade-based space combat.

   Here are four quick tips as you head into battle.

Choose Your Ship

   Dead Star offers many different ships, each with its own unique set of
   powers and roles in combat, broken down into the following types:
     * Scouts: These sleek, nimble ships are useful for exploration. They
       don’t have much combat power, but they can capture outposts four
       times faster than anything else.
     * Raiders: A mix of speed and power, Raiders are formidable in combat
       and also pack double the cargo capacity — making them the ideal
       class for upgrading your bases.
     * Frigates: The heavy hitters of Dead Star, Frigates pack a lot of
       health and offensive firepower at the cost of being among the
       slowest ships in the game.

   Dead Star on PS4 Dead Star on PS4

   Every ship class has three alien variations — the type you choose
   depends on your preferred gameplay style. The Valant are your
   offensive-minded powerhouses, loaded full of weaponry that take the
   fight to your enemies and create havoc on the front-line.

   The Ithid are perfect for pilots who thrive on guerrilla tactics —
   their cloaking devices and teleportation allow for quick surprise
   attacks.

   The Estari are the support crew of the three races. These ethereal
   energy beings can repair damage to ships while also packing a serious
   punch with their lighting-based attacks.

   You can carry three ships into battle, from any race or any class, so
   choosing the perfect loadout is crucial!

Battle for Victory

   Each region of space in Dead Star is procedurally generated from a
   collection of asteroid belts, minefields, derelict space junkyards, and
   dozens of other obstacles, so gaining intel from early scouting is
   vital to your team’s performance.

   At the start of every match, your team’s main goal is exploring the
   region of space and capturing neutral outposts to establish your front
   line — victory can be achieved either by destroying your enemy’s Home
   Base or by earning a set amount of resources from captured outposts.
   Early captures can turn the tide of battle!

   Dead Star on PS4 Dead Star on PS4

   Once you’ve captured an outpost, you’ll want to upgrade it using ore
   mined from asteroids within the region. Deposit enough ore into the
   outpost and you’ll unlock new features, including turret defenses, A.I.
   units you can commandeer to fly alongside your ship, or even
   sector-wide bonuses for your team. In addition to helping your team,
   upgrading outposts also earns you experience for your ship!

Level Up and Upgrade Your Ship

   As you battle for control of the region you’ll be earning experience
   for your ship by destroying enemy ships, capturing outposts, mining
   ore, or performing unique tactical actions. Earn enough experience and
   you’ll gain an upgrade point, which can be used to unlock new powers
   for your ship or improve powers you’ve already unlocked.

   Each ship has five unique systems that can be upgraded up to four
   times, improving everything from damage and defensive capabilities to
   general upgrades to your health, shields, and speed. Finding builds
   that complement your playstyle is important, but don’t worry if you
   don’t know where to start: we’ve incorporated an Automated Upgrade
   system that provides you with a build carefully selected by the dev
   team to keep you in the action and also learn each ship’s abilities.

   Dead Star on PS4 Dead Star on PS4

Earn Loot

   After every match in Dead Star you’ll earn rewards based on your rating
   as an effective pilot in five different categories, ranging from how
   many enemy ships you’ve destroyed to how many bases you’ve upgraded.
   The higher your rating in each category, the rarer rewards you’ll
   receive — whether it’s a cosmetic skin for your favorite ship, a fancy
   new portrait for your pilot, or rare components you can use to
   permanently improve your ship’s abilities.

   Also keep an eye out for Contracts — these extremely rare rewards grant
   your crew access to a powerful Capital Ship used to invade a series of
   live player matches. If your crew can survive the battle against the
   Dead Star community, you’ll earn the rarest rewards in the galaxy!

   Think you’ve learned enough for your first battle? Join the fight in
   Dead Star today on PS4 as a free PS Plus download for April. Visit our
   official forums to share your favorite ship and provide us with your
   feedback.

   Good luck, pilots — we’ll see you on the battlefield!

       “Everyone,” heh. Many people have been quite happy with the quality

       looks great.

       @ KongWen, Yes maybe not everyone but the rumblings are getting
       louder. So much so that other news outlets are starting to pick up
       on it and report it. It was recently reported that Sony’s PS Plus
       survey showed a 70% decline in customer satisfaction with the
       service from last year. That is huge. A lot of that has to due with
       the fact that these Indy games are horrible.

       And to the other troll about 70% dissatisfaction- care to share a

       The people that did that poll were just 4000 or so users of reddit
       on the PS4 subreddit who aren’t much better than the kids you see
       in YouTube comment sections. You should not use them as a
       representation of actual PS4 gamers. Most just go there to complain
       about everything.

       Most of them just hate on the games because they don’t have large
       budgets. Most of them don’t even try the games before judging them.
       Their opinions mean very little.

       This game is a lot of fun! A nice combo of arcade shooter and
       tactical combat. Feels like a space 4x game where instead of being
       the general and controlling the whole group, you control one of the
       grunts in that group. Can’t wait to get together with my friends
       and play again! Thanks for a pretty swell game.

       Could you guys help me with one question? I’m wondering how
       augmentations work because every time I try to equip them they
       unequip on there own. Thanks and so far I love this game!
     * spidercat2112
       04/06/2016 at 6:01 pm
       I really loved BROFORCE. I will admit that it had a few bugs in it
       (like your character freezing in place at the start of a level for
       about 2 seconds). But they fixed it with last update. BROFORCE is
       just an awesomely fun game. It might not be to people who don’t
       know the references to all the action movie heros you unlock, but I
       knew them all. Plus every hero has their own special abiliities
       unique to the film they are from. Highlander was the last unlock .
       If you are a fan of movies like ‘The Notebook’ & ‘Twilight’; then
       this ain’t for you. If you think ‘Macho Man Randy Savage’ should be
       the voice of reason in your quest to complete a video game,then
       BROFORCE is that exactly. It isn’t made to make your heart swell,
       it is made for excessive bloody killing without emotion. Because
       that is the only way to get this job done. If you don’t like
       BROFORCE – I’m sure a store in your area will be having a sale on
       Vagisil soon.

   Is this yet another online only/have to play mp type of game?

   Or is there a solo/offline experience, even if it’s just playing with a
   bunch of bots?

   Even if it’s free, I’m only interested in playing if I can do so solo.

       Hi boomstickbhg,
       Dead Star is definitely a multiplayer focused game, so
       unfortunately we don’t have a single player story campaign at this
       time. We do have offline tutorials where you can fight against AI
       units to learn the basics of exploration and combat. We also let
       you try out any of the available ships in a solo Free Play area – a
       small scale map that has AI units and some Outposts you can take
       over. You can even tweak the parameters of the map to make it
       harder, or to test out the different map features like nebulae,
       asteroid variants, etc.
       Give us a try sometime – maybe you’ll find something you like! Even
       if the game isn’t for you, we’ve got some great music from Sam
       Marshall (@SamMarshallMuse)!

       Not sure how this will display since I’m actually replying to the
       reply to my comment…
       Thank you for the informative post. While I would like more Solo
       options, the fact that there is some free play solo is reason
       enough for me to give this a chance.
       Started my download, hopefully will have some fun with this later
       today.

       You might try out Rebel Galaxy. It’s not played from the same
       viewpoint, but it is a space game with plenty of upgrades and
       things to do. I enjoyed trying out Dead Star, but I ultimately want
       a game that isn’t played one round at a time.

       I never comment on forums but i feel the desire to defend indies
       and ps plus. We pay only 50 a year, and people like you most likely
       expect “AAA” every month?! That’s not only infeasible, but just
       plain dumb to even consider. I’d much prefer the indies we get as
       opposed to old AAA games that are either just ok (knack, watch
       dogs) or we already have.Expecting a battlefront, gta, infamous,
       etc. so early in the console cycle is either greedy or ignorant to
       how this all works. Be happy we get anything at all, let alone
       incredible games like Rocket League, Resogun, Dead Nation,
       Mercenary Kings, Towerfall:Ascension, The Binding of Isaac,
       Apotheon, Rogue Legacy, Guacamelee, Super Meat Boy, Helldivers, and
       now Dead Star. That’s just the ones that immediately come to mind.
       TL;DR: Stop complaining, be grateful, just try these awesome
       ‘indie’ games. If you don’t like them, even just half, then maybe
       you don’t know or care about what constitutes a good game. And you
       should find out yourself rather than immediately bashing a game
       because it wasn’t made by dozens of developers. Indie does not mean
       garbage, short, or boring.

       “Be happy we get anything at all”
       “Stop complaining, be grateful”
       Unfortunately, PS+ is not free and I pay for it. I feel grateful
       for free things in life, not the things that I pay for or exchange
       my time and knowledge for (work).
       PS+ as you seem to be putting it, and is the reality, nowadays is
       just Sony’s “pay to play online” schema. With the excuse of free
       games in the middle.
       I was one of the people who didn’t care at first when we had “bad
       months”, but surely Sony is on a streak now.
       While we’ve had some good indie games now and then, my feeling and
       the feeling of most people judging by comments and polls is that
       PS+ is not delighting the players. Even worst if we look at the
       competition, where it seems they are getting a bunch of AAA games
       thrown every month.
       “If you don’t like them, even just half, then maybe you don’t know
       or care about what constitutes a good game”
       Oh thanks, so you are the authority on what is good and what is
       not. Interesting. Last time I checked beauty is in the eye of the
       beholder but I’m clearly wrong.
       Care to tell me also what music should I listen to, what style of
       clothing should I wear and other things in life, Sensei?

   carabu,,,I agree 100% about the PS+ Decline.
   -It’s NOT a copincidence that more Indy games = angry gamers.
   -Only the minority for whatever reason sees ART & Creativity in some
   indy game.
   Usually pixelated garbage..
   —Always the same story from the creator/developer with a small 3 man
   team in some dudes garage.
   -Go play youre game somewhere else & quit forcing this crapy crap on
   the rest of us…
   –I’d rather have a AAA PS+ game for only 1 week a month instead of a
   month of mediocrity…

   I would love to play this, but I can’t get into a game. Infinite
   waiting screen is really irritating.
   So, after deleting all data and redownloading the game 3 times, I’m
   done.

   It looked interesting in the tutorial, but without the ability to play
   the game I am afraid I have to say I am passing on this. Deleted
   forever.

   How a game is allowed to be released in this condition is beyond me.
   Back to Smite for my MOBA style fix it is then.

   Yes free games are great,but it still sucks when u wait all month and
   the new batch is a letdown because its multiplayer only. Plus these
   games aren’t free,they’re rentals, when PlayStation Plus runs out so
   does our access to the games.

   04/05/2016 at 8:02 pm

   this is the first comment that i’ve posted here and i just want to say
   that this game looks cool; i’m very excited to give it a try! Putting
   indie games on ps plus is the best thing to happen to the community
   simply because it incentives the player base to try these
   unconventional titles as opposed to the cookie cutter AAA titles.

   give it a chance. don’t knock it until you try it… and peeps gotta stop
   being entitled. 24 games a year for 50 bucks is a great deal. even if
   you like only 3 games a year its still worth it. perspective. I paid 60
   bucks for watch dogs and it sucked haha.

   Usually when I see any kind of moba game I steer clear of it. The genre
   has a track record of being extremely irritating to me. But I’ll give
   it a shot. I remember playing in the beta for that Dead Island moba.
   This game kinda reminds me of it. Their style of progression was what
   kept me entertained as long as it did. Maybe this one will do the same.



   flooderdooden
   04/06/2016 at 2:28 am

   I agree with earlier commenters about the possibility of a single
   player/bot mode–if nothing else, just to get the feel of the different
   ships, as well as learn some efficient strategies for winning/capturing
   territory (more than just the basic tutorial). As it stands, I’ve
   played three rounds online, and two of them were instances where I
   spawned into the game late in the match with my team’s home base under
   attack. The third game we were quickly overrun as well, as people on my
   team didn’t appear to know what was going on. I could see this game
   being fun for those who team up, and frustrating for those that don’t.
   Having had three meh experiences, I’m not sure whether I’ll continue to
   keep giving this a try–in terms of ps+ game multiplayer experiences,
   it’s better than Hardware Rivals but a far cry from Rocket League. I
   definitely see where PS+ gives this game the chance for a much larger
   community/base, but I suspect my experience with the game is not an
   isolated one.

   I do wish the Armature team the best though, and for those that have
   had a positive experience, I hope you continue to enjoy!

   To be honest, i was looking foward to Dead Star but i find it VERY
   disappointing that the Game REQUIRE an ALWAYS online connection.

   It’s a good thing that it was given for FREE on plus ’cause for what
   the game offers/lack on top of the mandatory always online connection…
   I find it laughable that $19.99 is the asking price for non plus
   subscribers. Good Luck with that.

   I’ll add it to my download list hoping that Armature studios wise up,
   take the mandatory always online OUT and adds OFFLINE multiplayer mode
   / LAN on a future expansion/DLC.

   Until then… Game Dismissed.

   to pay for garbage service.

     * Valormok

   04/07/2016 at 2:23 am

   Dead Star is awesome! Really fun game with neat progression. Getting a
   grip of how everything works takes a few matches (it was the same with
   Helldivers) but once you know how the systems work it’s great, and it’s
   fun experimenting with the different ships and loadouts. I have had a
   few issues with dropping out of matches suddenly but hopefully that
   will improve.

   Also this is nothing like Galak-Z, it is far superior and a 100 times
   more fun. Zombi I find rather boring though, feels like a derivative
   Dying Light clone, without the parkour and with poor combat. But then
   it’s all down to taste and what you’ve played before.



   maxafin
   04/07/2016 at 3:02 am

   ps plus will never be what it was back on ps3 , it used to be an
   optional extra that was heavily incentivised by the games coming out
   every month, now it’s the only way to play online there’s no reason for
   huge triple a titles to be released onto it for free and with the
   significant rise in subscribers it’s likely not even feasible. That
   being said this is probably my favorite line up in a while so far!
   Deadstar is really good fun tactical combat and i look forward to
   grabbing some friends and forming a team. I also think that zombi is
   pretty badass! as much as ps plus doesn’t blow me away every week any
   more games like these are what keep me checking every month. binding of
   isaac and rocket league are probably my most played games on the
   console. not that i wouldn’t love to see some much better games on the
   service but this month I’d say was pretty good.

   I got to enjoy this for a few hours last night and have to say, I
   absolutely LOVED it! There was an Asteroids-esque MMO I used to play on
   PC about 15 years ago and while this isn’t the same, it’s the closest
   to it I’ve been able to find since then. I love the depth of it; easy
   to pick up and play but knowing your ship’s ins-and-outs is vital to
   going 22-0 with a decisive victory (like I did with the Warden last
   night).

   Dare I say, 2016’s Rocket League? Too soon to tell.

       Sorry to hear that so many of you cry babies aren’t enjoying these
       FREE titles, but I appreciate them. This game is especially amazing
       and I’m very much looking forward to more! More ships! More guns!!
       More game modes!!! Keep doing what you’re doing, Armature! <3<3



   Xanthus179
   04/07/2016 at 6:41 am

   Played it for a bit last night, and my strongest take away is that it
   is not a game for me. I love the flying around, and upgrading of ships
   and your base, but what I must be looking for is an experience where I
   am piloting one of those individual ships, working with others to
   upgrade our base over time, fighting off random enemy ships in the
   sector, and upgrading my own ship as I go along.

   It kind of feels bad to say, this is a beautiful game, but it makes me
   want to play something else.

   After reading this, and watching the PS Underground video, I am totally
   on board. Going to try bringing in some of my Helldivers squad mates
   and give this game a try. May turn out to be the first moba type game I
   ever get into (and I have tried others, just find them personally very
   boring).

   04/07/2016 at 11:19 am

   I am loving this game, I’m level 15 right now. All that said, the drop
   rate, and quality needs to be raised. Contracts should drop more
   frequently, and there are so many ships I’d like to be getting better
   upgrade material.

     * stevenomes
       04/09/2016 at 1:50 pm
       have you gotten any decent drops yet? im level 12. and have only
       gotten resources every single time. a few paint styles from time to
       time but i dont really care about that so much (ships are small).
       im thinking maybe they rare loot doesnt start dropping until you
       reach a certain level?

   Hmmm not a bad game just another in a long list that doesn’t appeal to

   Psn games although really poor for me as in not one has been played
   longer than 30-60 mins over the last 18 months before was the only one
   I played with any regularity and that was on steam.

   I tried this out a bit last night. seems like there are a lot of ways
   to play. i went through tutorial mode tried some free play and then a
   few games. i could see it being pretty fun if you are on a good team.
   Regarding ps plus games, i was looking at my library the other day,
   have quite a few of them now. i usually only download those that i am
   interested in but so far ive had fun with the following to varying
   degrees: Apotheon, Limbo, Valiant hearts, Binding of Issac – Rebirtih,
   steamworld dig, velocity 2x, guacamelee, super meat boy, escape plan,
   injustice gods among us, counterspy, msg5 – ground zeros, rocket
   league, super exploding zoo, styx, lara croft temple of osiris. i have
   too many AAA games right now im working on, its nice to have some
   smaller games to play when i dont have a lot of time for a marathon
   session. honestly with Dark Souls 3, Uncharted 4, no man sky all set to
   release within the next couple months, i dont need any more triple AAA
   games right now. im still doing another run in bloodborne, and havent
   finished star wars battlefront, msg5 -phantom pain, assassins creed
   syndicate, witcher 3, street fighter 5, resogun, borderlands 2, diablo
   3, far cry 4, wolfenstein.

       oh you don’t need any more AAA games, that’s a relief. How about
       the rest of us? I am not a millennial, before that gets thrown out
       there by the only guy on here who’s opinion is correct, but if I
       wanted bad indie titles I would pay for them, giving away a game
       designed with a small team who need the money doesn’t really feel
       right to me. and to all those capitalizing FREE games, I pay
       monthly for this service, care to share how you don’t?

       04/09/2016 at 1:47 pm
       i didnt think tuturial did much either. just played a bunch of
       games and im starting to figure out the strengths and weakness of
       each ship. stay in a group at first dont venture out on your own.
       if you play as scout ship (first colum of ship) they are mostly for
       patroling the map. very fast speed and can take over outpost
       quickly, but dont have much firepower so make sure you are not
       trying to take the outpost by yourself. raider ships, middle
       column, are kind of the middle type. are stronger and can play hit
       and run or support. also they an carry the most resources so if you
       want to farm this may be the best choice. the captial ships (not
       sure of their class name off the top of my head) are much larger.
       this is the third column. they are much more offensive but very
       slow. have some support abilities as well so you could potentially
       support if you want as well. the best way to learn ive found is
       just to play the games live. also had a few obnoxious teammaste on
       the mic so might be better off muting all if you are getting
       feedback or just some guy cussing every few words.



   stevenomes
   04/09/2016 at 1:35 pm

   been playing this game the last few days. its pretty fun. the cool part
   is you can play how you want. can just farm resources, play as support
   character in battles, play offensive as juggernaut type ship or raider
   style. the upgrades are kind of bland though. doesnt seem very eventful
   at the of the game i barely have gotten anything except upgrade
   resources. maybe the more rare loot comes once you get to a hire level.
   level 12 right now

   The last video in our little Tearaway miniseries is all about us: Media
   Molecule, the studio behind Tearaway and our first game
   LittleBigPlanet.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvs-z5RI2E8

   The video focuses on how we work, and how we assure everyone’s ideas
   are counted. Mm is an interesting place, a rather chaotic place where
   the term ‘herding cats’ gets thrown around a lot, but where somehow the
   chaos is channeled into communal creativity and the games we love to
   make. We love to inspire creativity in people, and we love to create
   our own unique games that we think will give people experiences unlike
   any they’ve had before.

   Tearaway is out this Friday, November 22nd and we hope it will provide
   players with exactly that – a new game experience unlike any other –
   we’ll let you be the judge!

   We hope you enjoy this last video in the series– remember to pre-order
   Tearaway to secure the cool pre-order bonus items. Week one orders at
   the PS Store will also include the bonus items, so those who prefer the
   digital version will not miss out!

   Tearaway launches on Friday (yay!), so take a good look at the trailer
   above to get ready for the big day!

       This week I feel like I have been over saturated by tearaway, there
       has been more media for it then for the ps4

       Yea Tearaway!!! Now PLEASE announce your first PS4 game!!! Can’t
       wait to see what you do with all that power.

       I appreciate the exposure given to Tearaway on the PS Blog, but it
       seems like there’s a real dearth of ads for it elsewhere. The
       majority -if not all- TV spots I’ve seen have been for the EU
       region and, more recently, they also had the killer
       Tearaway/LBP/16GB Vita bundle announced.
       I really hope the game does well for MM, as all the early
       previews/reviews so far seem to point to it being a title to not be
       missed.

       This looks great. Can’t wait to play it! Please bring the Tearway
       bundle to the U.S. and market the heck out of it! This has so much
       appeal to the average non gamer and creative types. Kids who play
       minecraft would eat this up.

       This game look so nice, I hope the launch goes well for you guys. I
       don’t own a vita right now, but I’m going to buy one before
       Christmas for sure. That being said, I sure hope NA is getting the
       nice bundle that was announced in EU (wink wink nudge nudge…). I
       would be so happy even without the 16 GB memory card and LBP.

       Really love to see passionate people making games, who aren’t in it
       JUST for the profit margin. It’s clear whenever you see
       MediaMolecules’ games, that they love what they do. Congratulations
       on creating another great game, can’t wait to get my hand on it.

       and whatever you guys have cooking for PS4 :)

       I really want to pre-order to get the bonus content, but I can only
       pay with PayPal and the only place I can find that carries the
       bonus content is Gamestop, who don’t take PayPal. Does anyone know
       if Best Buy carries the bonus content? Because it doesn’t say on
       their website.

       Mm is by far the most creative studio around.
       I cannot wait until Friday to get my hands on Tearaway.

       @9: I believe I read that all PSN purchases made in the first week
       will also get the ‘pre-order’ bonuses. Amazon.com also has the
       pre-order bonuses listed.

       @Zoomguy53 if you buy the game on psn in the first week you get the
       pre-order stuff. Also concerning paypal you can add funds to your
       playstation wallet using paypal on the web store. Just click the
       little coin icon and it will take you to a page to add funds.

       Do you know when I can pre-order this game off the US playstation
       store. I’m looking at the updated store, I found the tearaway game
       page thing but I still can’t pre-order or anything. Will I be able
       to pre-order from the US store? Will I have to wait for next
       Tuesday to get my hands on this game digitally?

       You can’t pre-order vita games on the US store yet for some reason.
       Will be able to get the game on the store on Friday tho.

       SCEA not supporting SCEE content well? NO. NEVER.
       SCEA doesn’t support Europe (or Japan really) content well at all.
       I know the markets are different, but it’s still Sony Computer
       Entertainment content and you should be trying to push it to some
       extent. Not just shove it out and watch it flop then use that as a
       “reason” for not localizing future installments… *looking at
       Invizimals*
       Hey, SCEA. Don’t be lame. /salty
       Anyhoo, can’t wait to play Tearaway.

       Recently got in the market for a PS Vita this holiday season, and
       naturally the Tearaway title caught my eye. However, I’m extremely
       disappointed in the lack of PS Vita bundles for the US market for
       the 2013 holidays.
       Now if Sony would only bring the PS VITA/ Tearaway/ LBP/ 16 GB
       bundle to the US sometime in the next month as gold_og_roger said…
       would be a happy camper.
       I’m sure that ANY PS Vita/ Tearaway bundle in the US this holiday
       season will do exceptionally well!

       I have to get this game for my PS Vita, but after all of my mula
       that was spent on PS4. I’m gonna have to wait on this for now. I’m
       guessing Little Big Planet Hub will be for PS4 hmmm.
