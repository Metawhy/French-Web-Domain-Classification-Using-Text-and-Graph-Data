  Arithmetic Protections Against Physical Attacks for Elliptic Curve based
                                Cryptography

Short abstract:

   This research will provide novel implementations of curve based
   cryptographic algorithms on custom hardware platforms. A specific focus
   will be placed on trade-offs between efficiency and robustness against
   physical attacks. One of our goal is to theoretically study and
   practically measure the impact of various protection schemes on the
   performances (speed, silicon cost and power consumption). The
   originality of the work lies in new mathematical approaches for
   optimizing and protecting cryptographic building blocks. Theoretical
   aspects will include an
   investigation of how special number representations can be used to
   speed-up cryptographic algorithms, and protect cryptographic devices
   from physical attacks. In particular, we shall explore the suitability
   and the efficiency of redundant encoding scheme to provide a natural
   protection against side channel attacks. On the practical side, we will
   design innovative cryptographic hardware architectures of a specific
   processor based on the theoretical advancements described above to
   implement curve based protocols. We will target efficient and secure
   implementations for both FPGA an ASIC circuits. As a first objective,
   we plan do develop an FPGA prototype of the processor. Our deliverables
   will include a fast and secure cryptoprocessor for FPGA that can be
   used in a variety of cryptographic applications. Specific programming
   tools will be developed for this processor. Both the processor hardware
   description for FPGAs and the corresponding programming tools will be
   distributed as open source. Another original and ambitious goal of the
   project is the design and fabrication of a specific ASIC version of the
   processor. Another ambitious objective of our proposal if the extension
   of our FPGA processor to handle all the arithmetic operations required
   for implementing the cryptosystems based on hyperelliptic curves.
