Top 3 Reasons You Should Automate Your Marketing Webinars

   By Shahin Shadfar

   “What the heck is Webinar Automation?” you may ask. Put simply, it is
   the future of webinars! More specifically, it is the process of
   creating one webinar, then cloning it and running it time and again in
   a live environment. No, this doesn’t mean just recording a video of
   your webinar and replaying it back in front of a new group of
   attendees. A video replay would lose any interactivity that defines any
   greatly produced webinar. You see, creating a powerful webinar is not
   as simple as talking over a PowerPoint deck for half-an-hour! Plus, I’m
   assuming your goal is not to put your attendees to sleep. A truly
   effective marketing webinar is interactive- it includes polls,
   well-coordinated live and/or pre-recorded video clips and other action
   requests for attendees to keep them engaged. Creating an interactive
   presentation also means you end up collecting more useful information
   from your attendees that can feed into your marketing automation tools
   for follow-up. By only replaying a video recording of your original
   webinar is not going to offer the same live experience. Creating
   automated webinars by leveraging Webinato’s unique AutoPilot module
   enables you to replay events with all their original interactivity as
   if they were live. Your attendees won’t even be able to tell the
   difference and bear in mind you can always seamlessly switch to live
   Q&A at the end!

   Now that you’re getting familiar with Webinar Automation, let’s talk
   about the major advantages of automating your marketing webinars.

                               [AutoPilot.png]

    1. Save Time. Less Hassle.

   Creating a more effective and powerful presentation takes time and
   resources. In addition to curating content like PowerPoint slides,
   polls, video clips, and documents to download, you may also need to
   coordinate with guest speakers whose calendars might not always line up
   with yours. Redoing the same webinar two days later, and then a week
   later for a new audience is a pain. An efficient and successful
   marketer like yourself is always seeking to streamline repeated
   processes, am I right? Having the ability to redo a webinar
   automatically will significantly save you time and resources.
    2. Stay Consistent!

    Reproducing your marketing webinars with the same content and flow
   will also offer a more consistent experience for your attendees. The
   time you free up on an ongoing basis will help you spend more time on
   the original presentation and create one outstanding webinar you can
   then successfully clone. You may be wondering by now, how you could
   adapt each webinar to your audience as new attendees may have new
   unanswered questions. The answer lies in Webinato’s hybrid
   automated/live presentation technology that essentially enables you to
   replay interactively the main portion of your original event, and then
   seamlessly switch to an actually live Q&A session. Webinato even allow
   you to answer questions in parallel while the replay is running if you
   needed to.

   Consistency has the benefit of not only offering your attendees a
   higher quality presentation every time, but also lets you better
   compare the results of your various events. For instance, you can run
   your webinar for group A composed of a certain demographics and again
   at a later time in front of group B of a different demographics. Now
   you can compare the conversion rates between the two webinars and draw
   more accurate conclusions given that both groups were shown the exact
   same presentation.

     This Creates Tremendous New Opportunities for You to Maximize Your
     Return-On-Event

    3. Make More Webinars!

    Webinar Automation will let you run webinars for different time zones,
   different group of prospects, and on different days of the week, thus
   allowing you to reach a much wider audience. This creates tremendous
   new opportunities for you to maximize your ROE (Return On Event) as you
   continue to collect data from your attendees on every repeated session.

   Webinato will even let you schedule webinars to run automatically at a
   certain time without you needing to be present. Imagine collecting
   information from prospects in Australia in the middle of the night
   while you are asleep in the US! The Webinato AutoPilot offers
   interactive replay even for on-demand sessions. This means that your
   target audience could run your webinars at the time they wish while
   still taking polls, asking questions and so forth and so on.

Some Web-Browsers are Not Bundling Flash Player Anymore. Now What?

BREAKING NEWS: Read Our Announcement of The New Upcoming Webinato Platform

   Webinato’s modular architecture to support high quality webinars has
   evolved and improved since our early days in 2004. We do not confine
   our platform to any specific technology, as programming languages and
   systems come and go over time.

   The hundreds of complex components that make up the Webinato system use
   a number of different technologies under the hood and our policy has
   always been to use the best tool available for every task.

   The Webinato browser-based interface uses Flash technology within a
   very secure environment. Although Flash may not be considered trendy
   anymore, it still offers unique advantages that are still unavailable
   in other web-based solutions, such as HTML5. This is the reason why all
   major webinar platforms still utilize Flash in their web-based
   interfaces, even though they are experimenting with HTML5. The Webinato
   engineering team is also actively experimenting with HTML5 and will
   deliver a version as soon as we are fully comfortable to deliver all of
   the functions we currently offer with the same level of reliability and
   security. We will be making an announcement regarding HTML5 in the
   first quarter of 2017.

   webinar

   But what do your end-users do if web-browsers don’t bundle the Flash
   Player? Just because the Flash player is not included in a browser does
   not mean it does not support it. Flash is still used on a large number
   of sites and systems. Our login page detects if a user does not have
   Flash Player installed, in which case he or she is invited to easily
   install the Flash player, which they’ll only need to do once.

   Having a browser-based webinar system is a major advantage over needing
   to have users install an entire application on their computers. Over
   80% of PCs and Macs in the US today have Flash Player installed. Once
   Flash is installed for another site, it will work flawlessly for the
   Webinato system as well, meaning that users don’t have to install it
   again for every site that requires it.

   So you can rest assured, and continue to focus on creating, delivering
   and automating great webinars without having to worry about your
   attendees accessing your Webinato rooms! Our 24×7 tech-support team is
   also available to help your attendees should they experience any
   issues.

   Stay tuned for exciting news on the future evolution of Webinato!

The Secrets To Getting The Max Out Of Your Marketing Webinars

   By Shahin Shadfar

   You have once again managed to gather dozens of potential customers in
   one virtual space at the same time, ready to attend your marketing
   webinar! This was a tough one – your mailing list response was less
   than stellar, but you got lucky with a masterfully executed Facebook ad
   campaign and the percentage of invitees that actually showed up was way
   higher than you expected!

   Now what? Show the same old boring PowerPoint deck and screen share
   demo? Or do you find yourself wondering what more you could do to get
   the most out of this golden opportunity of having potential buyers live
   and present at the other end of the wire? After all, they opted to take
   time out of their busy schedule to listen to you!

   Although a majority of webinars out there are static, uninspiring and
   flat out BORING, savvy marketers have developed a new generation of
   engaging, media-rich and result-oriented presentation techniques over
   the past few years that have proven to be much more effective. More
   effective presentations mean more money in your pocket! What are these
   new techniques, you may ask. Well, we’re going to spill the secrets
   here.

How to Entertain Webinar Early Birds

   Handling people who show up 15 minutes early to your webinar is a lot
   easier than handling people who show up 15 minutes early to your house
   party. For one thing, it doesn’t matter if your hair is still wet. For
   another, the Webinato platform has lots of tips and tools to keep
   early-birds entertained:
    1. Ask open-ended questions in the chat box. Early birds will answer,
       and as new audience members sign in they can read the chat thread
       and get involved.
    2. Run a pre-event slide show to include housekeeping topics,
       presenter information, social media instructions like assigned
       Twitter hashtags and a schedule of upcoming webinars. This lets you
       get your message out without using valuable webinar time.
    3. Launch opinion polls. When you are asking your audience to take
       action they are less likely to give in to other online
       distractions.
    4. Play music to set the tone of your webinar. A rousing march, modern
       electronica or soothing new age will help get your audience in the
       proper mood to receive your message.
    5. Entertain with videos. Sure, the sneezing baby panda may have
       nothing to do with your webinar topic, but dollars to donuts your
       audience will watch it – no matter how many times they’ve seen it
       before.
    6. Show the World Map. People love to see who else is present and
       where they are connecting from.
    7. Use the eCurtain. The eCurtain hides the stage while presenters
       finish getting ready for the webinar. The eCurtain, found in the
       tools menu, can display custom messages and play custom music or an
       audio message.

How To Create More Engaging Webinars

   You have done a great job in gathering tens, hundreds or even thousands
   of prospects for your next webinar! Using some specific techniques,
   along with Webinato platform, you can deliver greater value to your
   audience and get more out of your online events.

   Webinato is particularly powerful for sales and marketing webinars. In
   addition to offering a 100% web based easy to access and use platform,
   capable of hosting thousands of participants with high quality image
   and sound, Webinato offers you a number of interactive tools to
   optimize your presentation and significantly increase your conversion
   rate. Our customers have experienced conversion rates of over 30% by
   leveraging the following techniques!

   The success of a marketing webinar depends on three factors: the
   quality of its content, the quality of its rich-media delivery and its
   level of interactivity. The only area where Webinato cannot help you is
   the content of your presentation!

Use the Webinato Event Registration

   The integrated “Event Manager” in the “Admin Page” offers an intuitive
   solution to create and promote your online events. You can create
   exciting mobile-friendly landing pages for your events with a poster
   (image) and a registration form including custom questions. The event
   registration page lets registrants to share it with friends, add the
   event to their calendars or post to social media.

Display an in-room marketing banner

   omNovia’s room layout and functionality is fully customizable. In the
   “Room Settings” section of your “Admin Page”, you can set top marketing
   banners for your room. Clicking these banners opens a separate web
   browser that takes attendees to a web site of your choice.

Play a background music or display a custom message

   As attendees enter the room, you want to create a welcoming and
   comfortable atmosphere. Think of your Webinato room as a physical
   social environment, such as a hotel ballroom, where your prospects can
   become future customers. The customizable background music, with or
   without the eCurtain, can be used to play music or a looping
   prerecorded message.

Show the World Map

   By leveraging the World Map, in your room’s tools menu, you can show
   all the participants a live map that displays the location of everyone
   who is in the webinar. You can zoom in to focus on a specific country
   or region. This unique feature demonstrates to attendees not only that
   they are not alone, but also that there is a great level of interest
   and demand for your event. Besides people love to see who else is in
   the webinar and where they’re connecting from.

Show live video of presenter(s)

   To personalize your presentation, we suggest having your presenter(s)
   greet your participants using the room’s live video module. After the
   initial introduction, you can switch off your webcam if you want your
   participants to focus on your slide show or other material.

Show marketing videos

   With the Webinato Video Player, you can show private videos of any
   length or instantly access millions of publicly available YouTube
   videos. Think of your webinar as a TV Show! Some of our customers start
   their presentations with a short commercial, funny introduction or even
   a testimonial. The rich-media capabilities in your virtual room can
   help increase your viewers’ interest and remove boredom or other
   effects caused by lengthy and monotonous presentations.

Conduct Live Instant Polls

   Interactivity is an essential component of a successful webinar. Your
   attendees can get distracted or bored no matter how great your
   presentation content. You need to ask questions and engage them in your
   “show.” A useful tool is the Instant Poll. You should create your
   questions and answers ahead of time (although you may also type them
   “on the fly”) and run a few surveys during your live presentation. The
   poll results are available in the room reports.

Use clickable links in your Slides

   The Slides module in your room can show Microsoft PowerPoint
   presentations with animations, transitions and hyperlinks. To prompt
   action from your audience, you can have a large link on your last slide
   inviting attendees to click and go sign-up for a service or purchase a
   product. Insert this link into your slide using the hyperlink function
   of PowerPoint before you upload the presentation to the Slides module.

Display Room Announcements

   Another way to call for an action during your webinar is to post
   messages as Announcements. Unlike general chat messages that scroll up
   as new messages are added, the Announcement module enables you to post
   a colored message, or clickable link, on top of the chat.

Leverage Documents Folder

   Would you like your attendees to download your brochures or
   testimonials? The Documents Folder (located on the right side of your
   room) allows you to upload any type of file(s) or link(s) and make them
   available for attendees to access at any time.

Use the in-room Timer

   Marketing studies show that giving a sense of urgency can be
   particularly effective in getting prospects to take an action. The
   Timer function in your room lets you display a count-down timer. As an
   example, you may place a temporary discount of 30% on your product if
   purchased in the “next 10 minutes.” The Timer will display for everyone
   how much time remains until the end of the special offer.

Use the Cobrowser module

   The Webinato Cobrowser takes your attendees to any web page where they
   can individually interact and take actions. As an example, during your
   webinar you can take your attendees to a sign-up page and have each
   attendee fill out the form while you answer their questions.

Place a relevant end-room URL

   Finally, when you end the room, you can navigate your viewers’ browser
   to any web page. This page could be the “ordering” site and may
   encourage participants one last time to take a step. You can set this
   parameter in the Room Settings section of your Admin Page.

Reaching Higher Conversion Rates in Sales and Marketing Webinars

   While the number of sales and marketing webinars has been significantly
   increasing over the last few years, only a small number enjoy high
   conversion rates. Challenges posed by the lack of interactivity, the
   difficulty in maintaining attendees’ attention level and obstacles in
   conveying the message without the body language, to name a few, can
   negatively impact the results of webinars. Many marketers are content
   with the relatively low success rates they obtain as they compare them
   with more traditional marketing channels such as mail marketing.

   By using the right webinar solutions and deploying best practices one
   can reach much higher conversion rates and unleash the true power of
   interactive marketing. In this paper, we analyze the theory behind
   Attendee Action Threshold (A2T) and discuss practical methodologies to
   increase attendee responsiveness and, hence, the conversion rate in
   marketing webinars.

A2T

   Any sound marketing project requires predefined goals. In a physical
   marketing seminar as an example, your goals may be to have 40% of
   attendants register for your newsletter and say 10% purchase your
   product or service at the event. Whether it is filling out a form or
   purchasing an item, it requires an action from the attendee. The higher
   the number of actions, the higher the probability of ending up with
   more sales at the end of the day. We define similar actions during
   webinars. The question is “what will it take to have an attendee take
   an action?” A number of factors, which we will analyze below,
   positively affect the attendee’s decision to act in front of his/her
   computer monitor without meeting you in person. A certain comport level
   must be reached for a person to willingly take a step. If you manage to
   reach or exceed that comport level or Attendee Action Threshold (A2T),
   there will be an action. Naturally the A2T is different for each
   individual and you will reach better results the more people you manage
   to persuade.

                          Attendee Action Threshold

   Although this approach seems evident, it is easy to overlook the steps
   necessary to reach the desired results. We often witness eloquent and
   experienced speakers, who attain great results during physical
   seminars, produce mediocre webinar conversions. They sometimes get
   disappointed and quit giving webinars instead of enhancing their web
   conferencing methodologies. If you build your online presentation with
   the A2T in mind and consistently take into account the factors
   discussed below, you will be able to create and replicate successful
   webinars with unexpectedly high conversion rates. I am often asked
   “What is a good conversion rate?” and the answer depends on the
   content, the price point, and many other factors. In thoughtfully built
   webinars with $400 to $1,000 range price points we have seen conversion
   rates as high as 45% and much higher for attendees registering for a
   free service.

A2T Components

   In a physical seminar as well as in a web-based presentation similar
   factors impact the A2T. Below is the list of these factors with names
   adapted to a web-based environment:
     * Content
       Attendee Action Threshold The presentation content evidently
       affects the credibility of the presentation. The core content
       although adapted for the web does not need to be any different in a
       webinar from the physical seminar.
     * Look and Feel
       Just as you do not want to host your live seminar in an
       unattractive hotel or you do not wish to own a mediocre web-site,
       the environment in which you present your webinar reflects your
       company image and is influential on your attendees.
     * Interactivity
       It is critical to make an engaging presentation in which attendees
       participate instead of simply watching and listening. Grabbing
       attendees’ attention and holding it during the entire presentation
       is a significant challenge especially in a virtual environment.
     * Social Proof
       Social Proof is simply the theory that people’s behavioral patterns
       are highly influenced by the actions of the people or community
       around them. Robert Cialdini has written about Social Proof
       extensively in his influential book Influence: The Psychology of
       Persuasion. In the chapter on Social Proof, Cialdini suggests that
       “One means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what
       other people think is correct…We view a behavior as more correct in
       a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.”
       In a webinar it is powerful to show attendees how many others are
       not only attending but also taking actions.
     * Urgency
       It has been empirically proven that consumers are more likely to
       purchase at the time when they are exposed to time-sensitive
       offers. Therefore, the sense of urgency in marketing is to get your
       attendees to act as fast as possible during the webinar. You want
       them to feel that what they have seen is an offer they cannot pass
       up.

Webinar Tools for A2T

   Although web conferencing platforms have evolved tremendously in the
   last few years, few provide the quality, ease of use and interactivity
   necessary to make high impact marketing presentations. I suggest you do
   your homework and choose the platform that will enable you to meet the
   A2T requirements. No matter how good the platform, you should learn how
   to use it well and how to leverage its tools. Some companies provide
   webinar services to assist you throughout the process of preparing a
   webinar, in addition to the technology. It may be worth using those
   services at least a few times until you master the practice. You should
   not choose the platform based on its cost but on your ROE (Return On
   Event), especially if you are delivering webinars for sales purposes.
   We are going to review the six components of the A2T as presented above
   and discuss what type of tools in a web conferencing environment would
   allow you to achieve those goals. It goes without saying that
   adjustments to your practice, industry and habits are required.

Content

   The content of your presentation does not vary a great deal whether it
   is for a seminar or a webinar. If we included the content delivery and
   the format into the definition of content, you would need to use a web
   conferencing system that enables:
     * Animations in Microsoft PowerPoint presentations
     * Playing movies
     * White board
     * Live video

   It is often very effective to break the monotony of a presentation by
   switching to different formats instead of a long slide show
   presentation. You might want to:
     * Start with a powerful movie about the product or about yourself to
       add more credibility from the very beginning
     * Play other movies or video testimonials in the middle of your slide
       show
     * Make a point by drawing on a white board
     * Use a pointer on your slides
     * Show your live video to connect more with your online attendees.
       There are now High Definition live video options that allow
       charismatic speakers and presenters to establish a more effective
       relationship with the viewers.

   Incorporating rich media and visual aids into your presentations makes
   them more interesting and more fun.

   Although sometimes necessary, I would advise you avoid the telephone
   whenever possible. The higher audio quality and its synchronization
   with other features (and video) in the virtual room justify using the
   integrated audio instead of teleconference bridges. This should also
   significantly reduce costs.

Look and Feel

   Choose a platform that enables you to quickly customize your webinar
   rooms. You should see your webinar environment as an extension of your
   web site and bring as much cosmetic attention to it as you do for your
   web site. Have your graphic designer work with the webinar provider and
   create a space that reflects the values of your company. Customization
   does not stop at placing a company logo. You should:
     * Create a color theme or skin for the entire platform that conforms
       to your web site
     * Ensure the registration and/or login page(s) are consistent with
       your visual identity
     * Make sure the platform preserves the quality of your slide shows,
       movies and delivers high quality live video that does not distort
       the face of your presenters
     * Focus on attendee experience. You want to give a “wow” effect
       before even starting the presentation. How easy is it to access the
       webinar? How pleasant is their experience? Have you eliminated any
       frustrating elements that could affect the attendee’s mood and
       hence negatively impact the outcome of the presentation?

   In the early days of the Internet, companies rushed to build web sites
   and only later started to analyze visitors’ behavior and experience,
   which led to the web 2.0 wave. Get ahead of your competition by
   producing professional and pleasant webinars instead of just doing a
   web-based slide show plus audio.

Interactivity

   Although the webinar medium is the perfect interactive tool, many do
   not take advantage of the interactivity and deliver one-way monotonous
   and often boring presentations. Your event instantly becomes more
   effective if you manage to have your attendees become participants
   instead. It is possible (and easy) to offer an interactive session
   while still controlling the flow and not losing control over your
   event. It is recognized that you need to have attendees in a live
   seminar take an action every seven minutes if you wish to grab and hold
   their attention. Action may include raising hands, answering questions,
   taking notes, repeating a phrase after you etc. In a web based
   environment you are competing with so many distractions you do not have
   in a live seminar room. From checking emails and online chatting, to
   YouTube movies and kids playing in the background, you face major
   obstacles. It is a huge mistake to deliver a 60-minute slide show with
   voice over as your presentation.

   Here are some of the tools you can use to make your event more
   engaging:
     * At registration time, add a relevant custom question to the list.
       By doing so, you show them you care about their input and gather
       useful information you can use during the live presentation.
     * Before the start of the actual presentation, let people chat with
       each-other or ask casual questions as you want to create a friendly
       environment.
     * During the session ask people to comment or ask questions via chat
       and make sure you answer most questions. Bringing them the answers
       allow them to make an educated decision and brings them closer to
       taking an action.
     * Take frequent polls (not just one or two) and depending on the
       question, share the results with the attendees.
     * Ask attendees to download a brochure or other collaterals right
       into their computers.
     * In certain cases you might want to ask them to play a game within
       the platform. Certain web conferencing systems allow you to start
       quiz games, for instance.
     * Have more than one presenter or speaker intervene. The reason why
       they involve multiple presenters or commentators on TV is that
       viewers like witnessing dialogs instead of monologs.
     * If your systems allows, take attendees to a web page (probably
       towards the end of your pitch) where they can take an action such
       as registering for a service or purchasing a product. Some web
       conference platforms also incorporate shopping-carts or
       Home-Shopping-Network-like modules.
     * When you end the webinar, take attendees to a survey page.

   I do not encourage allowing people to ask questions verbally on the
   phone or via their computers since it is very difficult to manage a
   large crowd and can add unexpected echoes or background noises.

   Interactivity is probably the most critical component in your quest for
   A2T.

Social Proof

   There are a few different ways to communicate to your viewers the fact
   that they are not the only ones participating in your webinar and have
   them take an action since others are doing it. You can:
     * Show them the list of attendees or at least past attendees.
     * Show them a map with locations of participants as enabled in some
       web conferencing systems
     * Show them intense participation by means of interactive chat
     * Display a shopping cart with number of products sold
     * Play testimonial movies or for even more effectiveness have a past
       customer chat or talk live and relate his/her experience

   Mastering the art of social proof can help you start a snow-ball
   effect. Remember we are referring here to real-time social proof, which
   is inherently more powerful than some testimonials posted on your web
   site.

Urgency

   Leveraging one more time the real-time factor, urgency as demonstrated
   by numerous studies can be extremely effective. You can present
   time-sensitive offers during the webinar. You may show a count-down
   timer and set a discount or special offer for a limited time only.

   Urgency and Social Proof are particularly effective in a real-time
   environment.

   Mastering the art of producing effective marketing webinars will give
   you a definite edge over competition. By employing advanced recasting
   solutions you can also repurpose your webinars and monetize them
   without having to recreate them every time. The right balance of
   technology, people and processes will enable you to create successful
   webinars in a consistent fashion. Try to choose the right technology
   and apply some of the suggestions above for your next webinar.

   It might also be a good idea to hire webinar consultants or request it
   from your webinar service provider at least for a few webinar sessions.

The Webinato Platform

   While Webinato is the name of our webinar platform, our company,
   founded in 2004 by Shahin Shadfar, is called omNovia Technologies. The
   name omNovia came from the composition of latin “omni” (everywhere, all
   the time…) and “novia” for novelty or innovation. In 2004 our first
   webinar platform was designed to enable live online training for
   hundreds of attendees with a simple interface and integrated audio. It
   was the first reliable solution for large webinars.

   Since then we have been constantly innovating our webinar platform with
   interactive tools such as the unique and patented AutoPilot module,
   able to automatically run webinars. Indeed we are the inventors of
   Webinar Automation, that allows you to pre-record your webinars and run
   them in a fully interactive fashion as if they were live! We now often
   host webinars with thousands of attendees in the most complete and most
   reliable environment.

The Webinato Team

   Prior to founding omNovia Technologies, Shahin was in the team that
   invented and marketed the first secure Java and Cryptography based
   smart cards, now used as mobile phone SIM cards or in modern credit
   cards. Shahin also co-founded the Information Security group at
   Schlumberger leveraging smart cards as corporate identity cards.

   The Webinato team is a group of passionate men and women committed to
   helping you create the most engaging webinars for your virtual training
   or marketing presentations.
