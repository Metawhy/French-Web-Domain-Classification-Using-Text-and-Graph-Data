Honeywell DPR TruStability™ Board Mount Pressure Sensors

   Honeywell Sensing & Control DPR TruStability™ Board Mount Pressure
   Sensors are piezoresistive silicon sensors offering a ratiometric
   analog output for reading pressure over the specified full scale
   pressure span and temperature range. These Honeywell sensors ±1.6mbar
   to ±25mbar / ±160Pa to ±2.5kPa / ±0.5inH2O to ±10inH2O pressure range.
   DPR sensors are fully calibrated and temperature compensated for sensor
   offset, sensitivity, temperature effects, and non-linearity using an
   on-board Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Calibrated
   output values for pressure are updated at approximately 1kHz. The
   series is calibrated over a -20°C to 70°C temperature range. The sensor
   is calibrated for operation from a single power supply of 5.0VDC. These
   sensors measure differential or gage pressures. The robust and durable
   housing is designed to withstand harsh application environments.
