Doctors rely on more than just data for medical decision making

   A new study from MIT computer scientists suggests that human doctors
   provide a dimension that, as yet, artificial intelligence does not.

   Computer scientists find that physicians’ “gut feelings” influence how
   many tests they order for patients. Watch Video

   Many technology companies are working on artificial intelligence
   systems that can analyze medical data to help diagnose or treat health
   problems. Such systems raise the question of whether this kind of
   technology can perform as well as a human doctor.

   A new study from MIT computer scientists suggests that human doctors
   provide a dimension that, as yet, artificial intelligence does not. By
   analyzing doctors’ written notes on intensive-care-unit patients, the
   researchers found that the doctors’ “gut feelings” about a particular
   patient’s condition played a significant role in determining how many
   tests they ordered for the patient.

   “There’s something about a doctor’s experience, and their years of
   training and practice, that allows them to know in a more comprehensive
   sense, beyond just the list of symptoms, whether you’re doing well or
   you’re not,” says Mohammad Ghassemi, a research affiliate at MIT’s
   Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). “They’re tapping
   into something that the machine may not be seeing.”

   This intuition plays an even stronger role during the first day or two
   of a patient’s hospital stay, when the amount of data doctors have on
   patients is less than on subsequent days.

   Ghassemi and computer science graduate student Tuka Alhanai are the
   lead authors of the paper, which will be presented at the IEEE
   Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society conference on July 20.
   Other MIT authors of the paper are Jesse Raffa, an IMES research
   scientist, and Roger Mark, a professor of health sciences and
   technology and of electrical engineering and computer science. Shamim
   Nemati and Falgun Chokshi of Emory University are also authors of the
   study.

   How to measure feelings

   Doctors consider a huge number of factors — including symptoms,
   severity of illness, family history, and lifestyle habits — when
   deciding what kinds of exams to order for their patients. In addition
   to those factors, Ghassemi, Alhanai, and their colleagues wondered
   whether a doctor’s “gut feelings” about a patient also plays a role in
   their decision-making.

   “That gut feeling is probably informed by a history of experience that
   doctors have,” Ghassemi says. “It’s sort of like how when I was a kid,
   my mom could just look at me and tell that I had done something wrong.
   That’s not because of something mystical, but because she had so much
   experience dealing with me when I had done something wrong that a
   simple glance had some data in it.”

   To try to reveal whether this kind of intuition plays a role in
   doctors’ decisions, the researchers performed sentiment analysis of
   doctors’ written notes. Sentiment analysis, which is often used for
   gauging consumer attitudes, is based on computer algorithms that
   examine written language and tally positive or negative sentiments
   associated with  words used in the text.

   The researchers performed their analysis on the MIMIC database, a
   collection of medical records from 60,000 ICU patients admitted to Beth
   Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston over a 10-year period. This
   database includes doctors’ notes on the patients as well as severity of
   illness, diagnostic imaging exams, and several other factors.

   The researchers wanted to determine what, if anything, the doctors’
   notes added on top of the information available in the medical records.
   They computed sentiment scores from the notes to see if there was any
   correlation with how many diagnostic imaging tests the doctors ordered
   for patients.

   If medical data alone was driving doctors’ decisions, then sentiment
   would not have any correlation with the number of tests ordered.
   However, the researchers found that when they accounted for all other
   factors, the doctors’ sentiments did indeed help predict how many tests
   they would order. This effect was strongest at the beginning of a
   patient’s hospital stay, when doctors had less medical information to
   go on, and then declined as time went by.

   They also found that when doctors felt more pessimistic about a
   patient’s condition, they ordered more testing, but only up to a
   certain point. If they felt very negatively about the patient’s
   condition, they ordered fewer tests.

   “Clearly the physicians are using something that is not in the data to
   drive part of their decision making,” Alhanai says. “What’s important
   is that some of those unseen effects are reflected by their sentiment.”

   Sentimental machines

   Next, the researchers hope to learn more about just what factors
   contribute to doctors’ gut feelings. That could potentially lead to the
   development of artificial intelligence systems that could learn to
   incorporate the same information that doctors are using to evaluate
   patients.

   “The question is, can you get the machine to do something like that? It
   would be very interesting to teach the machine to approximate what the
   doctor encodes in their sentiment by using data not currently captured
   by electronic health systems, such as their speech,” Alhanai says.

   The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
   Neuroimaging Training Grant, the Abu Dhabi Education Council, the NIH
   Critical Care Informatics Grant, and the NIH Research Resource for
   Complex Physiologic Signals Grant.

   A region that holds one of the biggest concentrations of people on
   Earth could be pushing against the boundaries of habitability by the
   latter part of this century, a new study shows.

   Research has shown that beyond a certain threshold of temperature and
   humidity, a person cannot survive unprotected in the open for extended
   periods — as, for example, farmers must do. Now, a new MIT study shows
   that unless drastic measures are taken to limit climate-changing
   emissions, China’s most populous and agriculturally important region
   could face such deadly conditions repeatedly, suffering the most
   damaging heat effects, at least as far as human life is concerned, of
   any place on the planet.

   The study shows that the risk of deadly heat waves is significantly
   increased because of intensive irrigation in this relatively dry but
   highly fertile region, known as the North China Plain — a region whose
   role in that country is comparable to that of the Midwest in the U.S.
   That increased vulnerability to heat arises because the irrigation
   exposes more water to evaporation, leading to higher humidity in the
   air than would otherwise be present and exacerbating the physiological
   stresses of the temperature.

   The new findings, by Elfatih Eltahir at MIT and Suchul Kang at the
   Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, are reported in the
   journal Nature Communications. The study is the third in a set; the
   previous two projected increases of deadly heat waves in the Persian
   Gulf area and in South Asia. While the earlier studies found serious
   looming risks, the new findings show that the North China Plain, or
   NCP, faces the greatest risks to human life from rising temperatures,
   of any location on Earth.

   “The response is significantly larger than the corresponsing response
   in the other two regions,” says Eltahir, who is the the Breene M. Kerr
   Professor of Hydrology and Climate and Professor of Civil and
   Environmental Engineering. The three regions the researchers studied
   were picked because past records indicate that combined temperature and
   humidity levels reached greater extremes there than on any other land
   masses. Although some risk factors are clear — low-lying valleys and
   proximity to warm seas or oceans — “we don’t have a general
   quantitative theory through which we could have predicted” the location
   of these global hotspots, he explains. When looking empirically at past
   climate data, “Asia is what stands out,” he says.

   Although the Persian Gulf study found some even greater temperature
   extremes, those were confined to the area over the water of the Gulf
   itself, not over the land. In the case of the North China Plain, “This
   is where people live,” Eltahir says.

   The key index for determining survivability in hot weather, Eltahir
   explains, involves the combination of heat and humidity, as determined
   by a measurement called the wet-bulb temperature. It is measured by
   literally wrapping wet cloth around the bulb (or sensor) of a
   thermometer, so that evaporation of the water can cool the bulb. At 100
   percent humidity, with no evaporation possible, the wet-bulb
   temperature equals the actual temperature.

   This measurement reflects the effect of temperature extremes on a
   person in the open, which depends on the body’s ability to shed heat
   through the evaporation of sweat from the skin. At a wet-bulb
   temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 F), a healthy person may not be
   able to survive outdoors for more than six hours, research has shown.
   The new study shows that under business-as-usual scenarios for
   greenhouse gas emissions, that threshold will be reached several times
   in the NCP region between 2070 and 2100.

   “This spot is just going to be the hottest spot for deadly heat waves
   in the future, especially under climate change,” Eltahir says. And
   signs of that future have already begun: There has been a substantial
   increase in extreme heat waves in the NCP already in the last 50 years,
   the study shows. Warming in this region over that period has been
   nearly double the global average — 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade
   versus 0.13. In 2013, extreme heat waves in the region persisted for up
   to 50 days, and maximum temperatures topped 38 C in places. Major heat
   waves occurred in 2006 and 2013, breaking records. Shanghai, East
   China’s largest city, broke a 141-year temperature record in 2013, and
   dozens died.

   To arrive at their projections, Eltahir and Kang ran detailed climate
   model simulations of the NCP area — which covers about 4,000 square
   kilometers — for the past 30 years. They then selected only the models
   that did the best job of matching the actual observed conditions of the
   past period, and used those models to project the future climate over
   30 years at the end of this century. They used two different future
   scenarios: business as usual, with no new efforts to reduce emissions;
   and moderate reductions in emissions, using standard scenarios
   developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Each
   version was run two different ways: one including the effects of
   irrigation, and one with no irrigation.

   One of the surprising findings was the significant contribution by
   irrigation to the problem — on average, adding about a half-degree
   Celsius to the overall warming in the region that would occur
   otherwise. That’s because, even though extra moisture in the air
   produces some local cooling effect at ground level, this is more than
   offset by the added physiological stress imposed by the higher
   humidity, and by the fact that extra water vapor — itself a powerful
   greenhouse gas — contributes to an overall warming of the air mass.

   “Irrigation exacerbates the impact of climate change,” Eltahir says. In
   fact, the researchers report, the combined effect, as projected by the
   models, is a bit greater the sum of the individual impacts of
   irrigation or climate change alone, for reasons that will require
   further research.

   The bottom line, as the researchers write in the paper, is the
   importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce the
   likelihood of such extreme conditions. They conclude, “China is
   currently the largest contributor to the emissions of greenhouse gases,
   with potentially serious implications to its own population:
   Continuation of the current pattern of global emissions may limit
   habitability of the most populous region of the most populous country
   on Earth.”

   “This is a solid piece of research, extending and refining some of the
   previous studies on man-made climate change and its role on heat
   waves,” says Christoph Schauer, a professor of atmospheric and climate
   science at ETH Zurich, who was involved in the work. “This is a very
   useful study. It highlights some of the potentially serious challenges
   that will emerge with unabated climate change. … These are important
   and timely results, as they may lead to adequate adaptation measures
   before potentially serious climate conditions will emerge.”

   Schauer adds that “While there is overwhelming evidence that climate
   change has started to affect the frequency and intensity of heat waves,
   century-scale climate projections imply considerable uncertainties”
   that will require further study. However, he says, “Regarding the
   health impact of high wet-bulb temperatures, the applied health
   threshold (wet-bulb temperatures near the human body temperature) is
   very solid and it actually derives from fundamental physical
   principles.”

   With apologies to “Spinal Tap,” it appears that black can, indeed, get
   more black.

   MIT engineers report today that they have cooked up a material that is
   10 times blacker than anything that has previously been reported. The
   material is made from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, or CNTs —
   microscopic filaments of carbon, like a fuzzy forest of tiny trees,
   that the team grew on a surface of chlorine-etched aluminum foil. The
   foil captures at least 99.995 percent* of any incoming light, making it
   the blackest material on record.

   The researchers have published their findings today in the journal
   ACS-Applied Materials and Interfaces. They are also showcasing the
   cloak-like material as part of a new exhibit today at the New York
   Stock Exchange, titled “The Redemption of Vanity.”

   The artwork, conceived by Diemut Strebe, an artist-in-residence at the
   MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology, in collaboration with
   Brian Wardle, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, and his
   group, and MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology
   artist-in-residence Diemut Strebe, features a 16.78-carat natural
   yellow diamond from LJ West Diamonds, estimated to be worth $2 million,
   which the team coated with the new, ultrablack CNT material. The effect
   is arresting: The gem, normally brilliantly faceted, appears as a flat,
   black void.

   Wardle says the CNT material, aside from making an artistic statement,
   may also be of practical use, for instance in optical blinders that
   reduce unwanted glare, to help space telescopes spot orbiting
   exoplanets.

   “There are optical and space science applications for very black
   materials, and of course, artists have been interested in black, going
   back well before the Renaissance,” Wardle says. “Our material is 10
   times blacker than anything that’s ever been reported, but I think the
   blackest black is a constantly moving target. Someone will find a
   blacker material, and eventually we’ll understand all the underlying
   mechanisms, and will be able to properly engineer the ultimate black.”

   Wardle’s co-author on the paper is former MIT postdoc Kehang Cui, now a
   professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

   Into the void

   Wardle and Cui didn’t intend to engineer an ultrablack material.
   Instead, they were experimenting with ways to grow carbon nanotubes on
   electrically conducting materials such as aluminum, to boost their
   electrical and thermal properties.

   But in attempting to grow CNTs on aluminum, Cui ran up against a
   barrier, literally: an ever-present layer of oxide that coats aluminum
   when it is exposed to air. This oxide layer acts as an insulator,
   blocking rather than conducting electricity and heat. As he cast about
   for ways to remove aluminum’s oxide layer, Cui found a solution in
   salt, or sodium chloride.

   At the time, Wardle’s group was using salt and other pantry products,
   such as baking soda and detergent, to grow carbon nanotubes. In their
   tests with salt, Cui noticed that chloride ions were eating away at
   aluminum’s surface and dissolving its oxide layer.

   “This etching process is common for many metals,” Cui says. “For
   instance, ships suffer from corrosion of chlorine-based ocean water.
   Now we’re using this process to our advantage.”

   Cui found that if he soaked aluminum foil in saltwater, he could remove
   the oxide layer. He then transferred the foil to an oxygen-free
   environment to prevent reoxidation, and finally, placed the etched
   aluminum in an oven, where the group carried out techniques to grow
   carbon nanotubes via a process called chemical vapor deposition.

   By removing the oxide layer, the researchers were able to grow carbon
   nanotubes on aluminum, at much lower temperatures than they otherwise
   would, by about 100 degrees Celsius. They also saw that the combination
   of CNTs on aluminum significantly enhanced the material’s thermal and
   electrical properties — a finding that they expected.

   What surprised them was the material’s color.

   “I remember noticing how black it was before growing carbon nanotubes
   on it, and then after growth, it looked even darker,” Cui recalls. “So
   I thought I should measure the optical reflectance of the sample.

   “Our group does not usually focus on optical properties of materials,
   but this work was going on at the same time as our art-science
   collaborations with Diemut, so art influenced science in this case,”
   says Wardle.

   Wardle and Cui, who have applied for a patent on the technology, are
   making the new CNT process freely available to any artist to use for a
   noncommercial art project.

   “Built to take abuse”

   Cui measured the amount of light reflected by the material, not just
   from directly overhead, but also from every other possible angle. The
   results showed that the material absorbed at least 99.995 percent of
   incoming light, from every angle. In other words, it reflected 10 times
   less light than all other superblack materials, including Vantablack.
   If the material contained bumps or ridges, or features of any kind, no
   matter what angle it was viewed from, these features would be
   invisible, obscured in a void of black.

   The researchers aren’t entirely sure of the mechanism contributing to
   the material’s opacity, but they suspect that it may have something to
   do with the combination of etched aluminum, which is somewhat
   blackened, with the carbon nanotubes. Scientists believe that forests
   of carbon nanotubes can trap and convert most incoming light to heat,
   reflecting very little of it back out as light, thereby giving CNTs a
   particularly black shade.

   “CNT forests of different varieties are known to be extremely black,
   but there is a lack of mechanistic understanding as to why this
   material is the blackest. That needs further study,” Wardle says.

   The material is already gaining interest in the aerospace community.
   Astrophysicist and Nobel laureate John Mather, who was not involved in
   the research, is exploring the possibility of using Wardle’s material
   as the basis for a star shade — a massive black shade that would shield
   a space telescope from stray light.

   “Optical instruments like cameras and telescopes have to get rid of
   unwanted glare, so you can see what you want to see,” Mather says.
   “Would you like to see an Earth orbiting another star? We need
   something very black. … And this black has to be tough to withstand a
   rocket launch. Old versions were fragile forests of fur, but these are
   more like pot scrubbers — built to take abuse."

   *An earlier version of this story stated that the new material captures
   more than 99.96 percent of incoming light. That number has been updated
   to be more precise; the material absorbs at least 99.995 of incoming
   light.

       knowledge in climate science and stress the urgent need for action.
     * This diagram shows an edge-on view of the molecular structure of
       the new coating material. The thin layered material being coated is
       shown in violet at bottom, and the ambient air is shown as the
       scattered molecules of oxygen and water at the top. The dark layer
       in between is the protective material, which allows some oxygen
       (red) through, forming an oxide layer below that provides added
       protection.

Protecting atomic sheets
       Ultrathin coating could protect 2D materials from corrosion,
       enabling their use in optics and electronics.
     * MIT engineers have programmed viruses called bacteriophages to kill
       different strains of E. coli, by making mutations in a viral
       protein that binds to host cells.

Fighting drug resistance
       Engineered viruses that target bacteria could offer a new weapon to
       combat infection.

       A study by MIT researchers underscores the importance of sleep
       consistency when it comes to academic performance, reports Jamie
       Ducharme for TIME. “If you can just get the same amount each night,
       compared to someone who averages the same amount as you but gets
       less consistent sleep, you’re going to do better,” says Prof. Jeff
       Grossman.

     * A simulation of early galaxy formation under three dark matter
       scenarios. In a universe filled with cold dark matter, early
       galaxies would first form in bright halos (far left). If dark
       matter is instead warm, galaxies would form first in long,
       tail-like filaments (center). Fuzzy dark matter would produce
       similar filaments, though striated (far right), like the strings of
       a harp.

This is how a “fuzzy” universe may have looked
       Scientists simulate early galaxy formation in a universe of dark
       matter that is ultralight, or “fuzzy,” rather than cold or warm.
       MIT News
     * A system designed by researchers at MIT and elsewhere enables
       interconnected smart devices to cooperatively pinpoint their
       positions in noisy environments where GPS usually fails, which is
       useful for emerging “localization-of-things” applications.

System helps smart devices find their position
       Connected devices can now share position information, even in
       noisy, GPS-denied areas.

     * Even relatively small differences in the duration, timing, and
       consistency of students' sleep may have significant effects on
       course test results, a new MIT study shows.

Study: Better sleep habits lead to better college grades
       Data on MIT students underscore the importance of getting enough
       sleep; bedtime also matters.

     * A lattice structure, originally printed flat, has morphed into the
       outline of a human face after changing in response to the
       surrounding temperature. Perspective view (left), top view
       (middle), and side view (right) of transformed lattice,
       approximately 160mm tall.

This flat structure morphs into shape of a human face when temperature

     * Writing for the Financial Times, Channing Arndt highlights a study
       co-authored by MIT researchers that finds climate mitigation
       efforts will not hamper economic growth in developing countries.
       “If poorer countries were exempted for a period of time from having
       to curb emissions, not only would climate change still be
       constrained, but most poorer countries would be likely to reap net
       economic benefits,” writes Arndt.
       Financial Times
     * MIT researchers have developed a 3D-printed mesh structure that can
       transform from a flat surface into complex shapes in response to
       temperature changes, reports the Xinhua news agency. “The technique
       can be used to design deployable structures like tents or coverings
       that automatically unfurl and inflate, and also be used as
       scaffolds for artificial tissue or deformable lenses in
       telescopes.”

     * UPI reporter Brooks Hays writes that MIT researchers has developed
       a new test to verify the destruction of nuclear weapons. “The test
       can identify the specific isotope of the target element, which
       could allow inspectors to confirm the identity of a warhead before
       it's disassembled,” writes Hays.

     * Writing for The Boston Globe, Prof. Richard Samuels examines
       Japan’s current approach towards foreign policy and national

       progressivism…repels independents, with a negative effect that is
       stronger and clearer than the signs of enthusiasm generated among
       Democrats.”
