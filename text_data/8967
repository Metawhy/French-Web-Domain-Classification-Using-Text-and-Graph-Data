The last CITES

   Posted on 02/10/2019 by johnray

   With a bit of luck this will be the last time I have to fill out CITES
   paperwork. Musical instruments will be exempt from CITES II and III
   controls starting soon. These two years of having to comply has been an
   added hassle that we just don’t need so we are quite happy about it.
   From now on it will just be articles in Appendix I that will be
   problematic. I have always tried to avoid restricted wood so I will say
   good-bye to CITES forever.

Where to see a guitar show in Granada

   Posted on 28/09/2019 by johnray

   Marcus Toscano is back with his daily spanish guitar concerts. So many
   people come to Granada and want to hear some guitar music but find that
   there is nothing available. Don’t miss this.

Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg

   Posted on 22/09/2019 by johnray

   My friend Knud Sindt, lute-maker, brought some students of this
   university and their teacher by the workshop on Friday for a peek into
   the world of Granada guitar-making. These soon-to-be music teachers had
   plenty of questions and enjoyed the sound of one of my Torres
   Invencible copies. The teacher Axel and a few of the students are
   guitarists and put the guitar through its paces. This guitar is a copy
   of La Invencible which I think I will keep on hand to show to potential
   customers as it has an incredible similarity to the original Torres
   guitars in its deep, deep basses and warm trebles. As always I copied
   this guitar directly from the original. This Torres is very special and
   one of the reasons is the bracing. In the photo of the original you can
   see how two of the fan braces extend into the upper bout by way of
   cut-outs in the lower transverse bar.

José Ángel Chacón

   Posted on 08/09/2019 by johnray

   I dropped in on José Ángel Chacón Tenllado yesterday in Málaga. He was
   my first teacher in this fascinating world of instrument-making. He is
   also responsible for the beginnings of artisans such as Susana Martín,
   Victor Quintanilla and his son José Ángel “Chico” Chacón Escobar. I
   caught Chico at the family workshop where he teaches lutherie and saw
   some old friends too. Always a pleasure to remember my roots.

Centro de Referencia Nacional

   Posted on 02/09/2019 by johnray

   We have been hearing for years now that Granada will be home to the
   National Centre of Reference for guitar-making. However, bureaucracy
   and bad management conspired to make that impossible. In the end
   Granada has finally been approved as reference centre for construction
   and maintenance of musical instruments among other things. There is no
   guitar programme as yet but perhaps another 10 years will see that.

A guitar for Segovia

   Posted on 23/06/2017 by johnray

   cd I am lucky enough to have as my friends and/or clients some of the
   great spanish guitarists and teachers. I met Javier Somoza while I was
   working with the 1924 Santos Hernández guitar for my article in Roseta
   published last year as he was executive editor for that issue. We
   finally got to have a drink and a meal together at the Madrid
   presentation of the journal. He played two pieces on the original
   guitar at that time and told me that he had plans to record this cd.
   The guitar is an excellent example of perhaps the best maker Spain has
   ever produced and the recording certainly does it justice. The music is
   well-chosen and very well played.

   I am pleased to see that the cd (available starting today!) has
   excellent distribution and can be bought in most european countries. I
   am not sure if Brilliant has U.S. distribution but I am betting that
   they do. In searching for these links I see that in some countries it
   will be July 7th before the cd is available.

   online shop

   France

   HMV

   FNAC

   Of course I need to mention that I have included a copy of this guitar
   in my catalogue and it is selling very well. RAY_Hernandez_03

The last CITES

   Posted on 02/10/2019 by johnray

   With a bit of luck this will be the last time I have to fill out CITES
   paperwork. Musical instruments will be exempt from CITES II and III
   controls starting soon. These two years of having to comply has been an
   added hassle that we just don’t need so we are quite happy about it.
   From now on it will just be articles in Appendix I that will be
   problematic. I have always tried to avoid restricted wood so I will say
   good-bye to CITES forever.

Where to see a guitar show in Granada

   Posted on 28/09/2019 by johnray

   Marcus Toscano is back with his daily spanish guitar concerts. So many
   people come to Granada and want to hear some guitar music but find that
   there is nothing available. Don’t miss this.

Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg

   Posted on 22/09/2019 by johnray

   My friend Knud Sindt, lute-maker, brought some students of this
   university and their teacher by the workshop on Friday for a peek into
   the world of Granada guitar-making. These soon-to-be music teachers had
   plenty of questions and enjoyed the sound of one of my Torres
   Invencible copies. The teacher Axel and a few of the students are
   guitarists and put the guitar through its paces. This guitar is a copy
   of La Invencible which I think I will keep on hand to show to potential
   customers as it has an incredible similarity to the original Torres
   guitars in its deep, deep basses and warm trebles. As always I copied
   this guitar directly from the original. This Torres is very special and
   one of the reasons is the bracing. In the photo of the original you can
   see how two of the fan braces extend into the upper bout by way of
   cut-outs in the lower transverse bar.

José Ángel Chacón

   Posted on 08/09/2019 by johnray

   I dropped in on José Ángel Chacón Tenllado yesterday in Málaga. He was
   my first teacher in this fascinating world of instrument-making. He is
   also responsible for the beginnings of artisans such as Susana Martín,
   Victor Quintanilla and his son José Ángel “Chico” Chacón Escobar. I
   caught Chico at the family workshop where he teaches lutherie and saw
   some old friends too. Always a pleasure to remember my roots.

Centro de Referencia Nacional

   Posted on 02/09/2019 by johnray

   We have been hearing for years now that Granada will be home to the
   National Centre of Reference for guitar-making. However, bureaucracy
   and bad management conspired to make that impossible. In the end
   Granada has finally been approved as reference centre for construction
   and maintenance of musical instruments among other things. There is no
   guitar programme as yet but perhaps another 10 years will see that.

A guitar for Segovia

   Posted on 23/06/2017 by johnray

   cd I am lucky enough to have as my friends and/or clients some of the
   great spanish guitarists and teachers. I met Javier Somoza while I was
   working with the 1924 Santos Hernández guitar for my article in Roseta
   published last year as he was executive editor for that issue. We
   finally got to have a drink and a meal together at the Madrid
   presentation of the journal. He played two pieces on the original
   guitar at that time and told me that he had plans to record this cd.
   The guitar is an excellent example of perhaps the best maker Spain has
   ever produced and the recording certainly does it justice. The music is
   well-chosen and very well played.

   I am pleased to see that the cd (available starting today!) has
   excellent distribution and can be bought in most european countries. I
   am not sure if Brilliant has U.S. distribution but I am betting that
   they do. In searching for these links I see that in some countries it
   will be July 7th before the cd is available.

   HMV

   FNAC

   Of course I need to mention that I have included a copy of this guitar
   in my catalogue and it is selling very well. RAY_Hernandez_03

Adiós a un maestro

   Posted on 06/11/2019 by johnray

   Hoy es un día triste para la luthería. José Ángel Chacón Tenllado
   falleció esta madrugada con 85 años plenamente aprovechados y dejando
   atrás una obra compuesto por multitúd de instrumentos de cuerda,
   artesanos formados en la luthería y una “Escuela Malagueña de Luthería”
   que es tanto una tradición como una realidad donde los alumnos aprenden
   ahora con el heredero José Ángel Chacón Escobar. Aunque yo hice mi
   primer instrumento aquí en Granada con cuatro consejos de Antonio Marín
   y Jonathan Hinves, mi primera enseñanza fue en Málaga con José Ángel.
   Aprendí muchísimo sobre la madera, las herramientas, historia y la
   cultura músical. También terminé allí la guitarra que aún conservo y
   toco. Hoy tendríamos que honrar la visión de José Ángel, una visión de
   una escuela de luthería con fondos públicos y un reconocimiento de este
   oficio tan importante. Hizo grandes pasos hacía una escuela oficial
   pero hay trabajo por hacer todavía.

   Today is a sad day for those of us who live by the chisel and the
   plane. José Ángel Chacón Tenllado passed away early this morning at the
   age of 85 having lived a full life and leaving behind a legacy that any
   luthier would be proud of. He founded the “Escuela Malagueña de
   Luthería”, taught many a builder, and built hundreds of stringed
   instruments. His son José Ángel Chacón Escobar carries on the tradition
   and continues to teach students at the family workshop. Although I
   built my first instrument here in Granada with a few consultations with
   Antonio Marín and Jonathan Hinves, the first person to take an interest
   in teaching me was José Ángel in Málaga. I learned so much about wood,
   tools, history and musical culture. I also built my first guitar and I
   still have it and play it.

   In the video above you can see that he was named Maestro Artesano by
   the regional government (the first luthier to have that honor), he
   earned the medalla de plata al mérito de las bellas artes from the
   Ministry of Culture. He also wrote two books on the subject of
   lutherie. He was a man with a vision and that vision was of an official
   school of lutherie and public support for it. He achieved great things
   both in Málaga and in Gelves, Sevilla but Spanish governments still
   refuse to value lutherie in the way it is valued all over the world.

First in a series

   Posted on 03/11/2019 by johnray

   I was perusing my collection of guitar books and realised that while
   some of you might have a similar collection there are certainly those
   among you who will be interested in hearing some of the anecdotes found
   in those books. I’m starting with a book by Julia Crowe which I loved.
   It is full of stories from guitarists from all “walks” of music. The
   title is “My First Guitar” and is based on interviews with a plethora
   of guitarists, guitar-makers and technicians. The books makes for a
   great read even if your heros are not guitar heros; mine are. Here is
   something from Juan Martin’s story on page 107:

     When I was seventeen, I went to Madrid and mixed up with the great
     players in the capital. I used to listen to a record of the great
     flamenco guitarist Niño Ricardo, and would do this by slowing down
     the old 33 rpm LP to the speed of 16, making the music one octave
     lower. This way, I could more or less work out what I was hearing.
     So when I traveled to Madrid, I went to the Conde Hermanos shop with
     the hope of finding a better guitar than the Conde I had or at least
     to see if they could make it better for me. I played this Ricardo
     material and there was this old man in the shop, listening. He said
     to to me, gruffly, “¿Tu quien eres?” (“Who are you?”). I said “Juan
     Martin.” “¿De donde ha aprendido esto?” (“Where did you learn
     this?”). I told him I learned it from Niño Ricardo.          “Yo soy
     el Ricardo!” he growled.

   Of course he goes on to tell how he learned from and drank wine with
   Niño Ricardo and went on to meet other guitar greats. The book is
   inspiring and funny and well worth tracking down. The ebook version is
   readily available and you can contact Julia for a copy on her blog at
   this link.
