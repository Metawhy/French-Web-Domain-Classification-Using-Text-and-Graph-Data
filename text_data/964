   Hey there guys, back with another ride. You maybe wondering why a more
   modern vehicle cuz I usually do classic cars. Thing is a really close
   friend of mine loves this car and wanted to see it ingame which is why
   I did it. And ngl the conversion was pretty fun and actually kinda
   satisfying when everything comes together. Maybe I'll do more modern
   cars too down the line : )
   Also this is just the first version. I will add tuning parts later on
   in the future.
   Anyway here are the features as always:
   - HQ Exterior
   - HQ Interior
   - LODS
   - Dirtmap
   - HQ Tuning Parts
   - Proper Collisions
   - Real life spawn colors
   - Animated Engine
   - Breakable Windshield
   - Breakable Lights
   - Working Dials
   - Paintable Interior (Secondary Color)
   - Hands on steering wheel
   - Working Mirrors
   - Realisitc Handling and Engine sound
   - Proper Interior illumination (White when off, orange when on)
   Changelog:-
   v2.0
   - Added a bunch of tuning parts
   - Fixed small model issues
   - Removed AO for tuning support
   Credits:-
   Turn10 Studios - Model (Forza Motorsport 7 & 4), Textures(Forza

       @teunolan Sadly I couldn't find a proper engine model for this car.
       The current one is from the Rx7 Spirit R with RX8 engine covers.
       @MoravianLion @SLY95ZER @wolfysplace Thanks, Like I mentioned in
       the description, tuning parts are on the way. I just didn't have
       enough time due to irl stuff.
       @_Divine_ Happy Birthday dude, have a blast!
       @vitya93 Did you install it properly?

       @ Stellasin You see,when you shot the left side of the window,there
       was a big hole on the right side.And if you shoot the hole,you can
       see broken glass on the hole,which makes the car a little bit
       unreal.Except that,this car was perfect.

       @LukeDominic Oh yes I know this thing. Unfortunately this can't
       really be fixed properly. Most modded cars have this issue. This is
       because the boundaries of the window are stored in files that can't
       be edited.

       I was guna say thanks for making lod but surely having a 20mb of
       3dfiles is just as bad for servers as they still need that loaded
       into memory?

       Stellasin Author
       @StonedRaider The Lod is pretty big because the L1 is the exact
       same as L0. The reason for this is that I wanted to avoid people
       using the L1 model on low end rigs.

       The RX-8 is one of those cars that I hold dear into my heart, thank
       you for making such an absolutely gorgeous rendition! Mind if I ask
       if you're planning to add a back seat support? I've been getting
       back with LSPDFR, and it would be great to finally have a great car
       where I can stash em in. Some other RX-8s have done them, but they
       have not been of this quality. One more less important thing, do
       you have plans on making the digital speedometer functional?
       Absolutely great mod otherwise, keep up the amazing work!

       Stellasin Author
       @Aeztus You're welcome man <3. Yeah I was planning on adding a back
       seat with the doors but sadly I couldn't find a good model with
       door sills for the back doors. Most of them are low quality. And
       for the digital speedometer, I can do it, but I have to sacrifice
       the red needles which are more accurate to the real car. And sure,
       I will do my best :D

       @Stellasin Aw damn, so unless there's some miracle, you won't be
       adding rear passenger support? Yeah, I think going with the red
       needles was a great decision, so I'll probably go into the ytd and
       edit out the placeholder digital dial. Speaking of speed, the
       handling you did for this car is tbh actually also quite
       phenomenal. It feels a little lacking in corners but it does have a
       certain grounded-ness that I surprisingly really liked. In a way, I
       guess it felt real, so kudos for that!

       Hi @Stellasin,
       i like all of your Mod Projects ;-D
       Now i have a Question:
       Are you working on all of this Cars, that can be handled with LODs,
       because i would like to propose the Cars for the german GTA
       RolePlay Community "WIldLifeRP". Can we use the Cars for our RP
       Project?
       Have a nice Day

   NaturalVision Remastered (NVR) is a "work-in-progress" visual overhaul
   mod. Numerous changes were made to the environmental weathers, lighting
   system, ambient colors, tonemapping, weapons system, select textures
   and much more in order to blur the line between fantasy and reality.
   The goal was to try and make GTAV look visually similar to Southern
   California in real life. In order to achieve this, research on the Los
   Angeles (Los Santos) and Salton Sea (Sandy Shores) regions was
   conducted using hundreds of photos and hours upon hours of video
   footage. All of this was necessary in order to produce the most
   realistic visual experience currently possible with GTAV's limited game
   engine.
   Fun Fact: More than 4000 hours have been spent working on this mod.
   These things take time.
   The aesthetic behind NaturalVision Remastered was inspired by Forza
   Horizon, Watch_Dogs, GTAIV and a variety of other games.
   Numerous visual details were taken from those titles and remade in
   GTAV's various weathers.
   Unlike most graphics mods, NaturalVision Remastered does not rely on
   ReShade for its looks. This allows for players to enjoy a massive boost
   in performance.
   There are numerous optional add-ons included with this mod, ranging
   from a depth of field modifier, motion blur enhancer, LSPDFR related
   tweaks and much more. This gives users the ability to customize the
   game to their liking.
   It also includes an optional ENB and ReShade package which produces
   effects such as improved vehicle anti-aliasing, sharpening, deband and
   more.
   Please make sure to check everything out so that you can enjoy this mod
   as much as possible.

   Install guide is included in the super detailed "README" file within
   the download.
   The README is currently available in the following languages:
   English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Korean
   and Chinese
   Please read everything carefully in the readme before commenting about
   an issue. There is a good amount of useful information in there that
   should help troubleshoot your issues and also answer your questions.
   IMPORTANT You must put your GTAV display brightness at 50% for the best
   possible experience.

   With NaturalVision Remastered, your in-game performance will be about
   the same as vanilla.
   The only thing that matters is how you currently run GTAV without mods
   and the FPS you receive on average.
   If you plan on using ReShade then you may experience performance loss,
   but it's not necessary to use it anymore.
   There is little to no performance loss with ENB by itself, so feel free
   to use that.

       Well if anyone is interested I know how to fix the flickering
       shadows at night and resolve the issue with the Carcols.meta that
       creates the massive bright lights at night. Though I will need
       permission from Razed before I can release a fix. As for the
       ENB/Reshade crashing, I can look into that too. Never been an issue
       on my side.

       @jametco_ Doubt it. Unless the new update broke ENB which I also
       doubt. Pretty sure there is a compatibility issue with ENB
       overriding files that NVR uses.

       @WineDaddy8 It still works and is still supported. There is no need
       for an update atm. Issues are mostly due to incompatibilities with
       other mods, rather than with the mod its self. Sometimes gta5-mods
       has a period and you can't download certain files. Works fine for
       me.

       Does anyone else find this... rather underwhelming? In person it's
       difficult to tell what it even changes from the vanilla game
       besides some pretty minor lighting / color stuff.
       Is there some additional HD texture pack I need to be using in
       conjunction with it, or something?

       @oskar123123 I can fix the light flickering. I know exactly why it
       does it and which lines of code in NVR causes the issue. But I need
       Razed Approval before I can even think of creating let alone
       releasing modified version of his code.

       Reclusive Eagle
       @oskar123123 FPS drops are you have a probably due to rain/puddle
       reflections. Otherwise NVR is an entire visual overhaul for a
       majority of the games lighting/reflection systems so that alone
       requires more power than unmodded GTA V.

       @oldman82 Hey, sorry I did not answer you way earlier, but yes,
       that is/was legit. Of course, now you also most likely need to
       watch the video at the link posted by @FreedomDude to make it work.

       When Script Hook V gets updated (it will, right?), will we need an
       update for Menyoo as well? Also, what was the point in giving us a
       Rockstar Games Launcher? It was working fine after the Launcher,
       but then they updated it AGAIN. It's so pointless. It's like
       they're looking for ANYTHING just to stop modders from modding!
       Why? I thought they were okay with modding. Doing this to us isn't
       going to make us want to play online. I will NEVER play online.

       @Simmeh Menyoo won't need an update, nothing new is the update that
       R* released since last time I checked 2KB of data ain't enough for
       a car ahah.
       But seriously menyoo won't need an update for a while but anyway by
       then I won't have any doubts in my mind either the moderators will
       make menyoo their mod to 'update' or allow someone else to take
       over the menyoo page

       so since the latest gta "update" earlier this week, the game wont
       allow you to spawn DLC cars using menyoo, is there a fix or does
       menyoo need to be updated?

       @Starcasm12 If you're using the big download button, then that's
       the problem. Same thing happened to me until I installed the
       version of Menyoo in the pinned comment. (1.1.0)
       https://github.com/MAFINS/MenyooSP/releases/tag/v1.1.0
       If you install that version, your game should launch. It worked for
       me.

       Object Spooner seems a little buggy after the scripthook update.
       Vehicles vanish shortly after spawning in, I am using the github
       version.

       @xFrosts I got vehicles to stay spawned by changing persist setting
       from on to off and back on but some vehicles still vanish.. I guess
       we'll just have wait on mafins now... Atleast it's working after a
       fashion.

       Menyoo sorta works for me, but when I spawn the new cars from the
       Casino update, and try to drive away, they immediately disappear.
       What do I do?

       I get a crash every time I try to adjust the neon kit on my car
       through the Menyoo menu, other than that, great thing to have.
