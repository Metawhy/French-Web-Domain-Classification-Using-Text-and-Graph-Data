Pumpkin Donuts

   These pumpkin donuts are so moist you won’t dare to dip them in
   anything! Also I gotta be real, many baked donuts are disappointing.
   They’re like tiny cupcakes without buttercream that have been
   over-baked. MEH!!! These don’t have that problem, the pumpkin brings a
   lot of moisture and the glaze just seeps into the cake…

   snack on but they’re PERFECT for making a moist, delicious banana
   bread. While you’re at it why not throw in some chocolate chips and
   make this easy recipe a TOTAL crowd pleaser. It’s great with your

Halloween Cupcakes

   Halloween is definitely the time to go all in on your baking and sweets
   so this year I decided to to a fun group of spooky/cute cupcakes. I
   wanted them to have a wow factor but not be overly complicated or time
   consuming. I whipped up my favorite moist and fluffy chocolate cupcakes
   and got…

Pumpkin Pie Recipe

   Pumpkin pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts. It should have a
   crisp crust, SMOOTH, creamy filling with lots of flavor and my piece
   always has a mountain of whipped cream. Store-bought pie can never
   compete… How to Avoid Burnt Pie Crust I don’t know if you’re in this
   habit but tenting your crusts…

Nachos Recipe

   My loaded nachos recipe is so good there’s just no way anyone will be
   able to resist the temptation of this crispy, chessy, all around
   delicious snack. I added big dollops of sour cream just before serving
   but you can drizzle on some Mexican crema or a sprinkle of queso
   fresco.  Pro Tips for the…

Apple Roses Pie

   An apple rose pie is definitely a special occasion treat. Not because
   it’s too difficult but because it takes time to roll all of those
   little roses! If you want to save some time you can make a batch or my
   mini apple rose tarts or you could just arrange the thin slices in a…

Mini Pumpkin Pies

   I love pumpkin pie but sharing can be very over-rated so what better
   dish to whip up than mini pumpkin pies?!? They’re much easier to make
   and just as delicious. I styled them with a dainty dollop for the
   photos but they were completely covered in whipped cream (like a
   blizzard hit and there’s a…

Pumpkin Macarons

   I was nearly shocked by how well these pumpkin spice latte macarons
   turned out! Macarons can be tricky, it’s easy to end up with hollow,
   cracked or lopsided cookies. This time, I folded the mixture JUST
   RIGHT! I let them sit for almost an hour before baking and they were
   perfect. I’m also loving the…

   almost forgot to…

French Toast

   French toast is a classic breakfast treat you can make with a few
   ingredients you probably have on hand already. When done right it
   should be moist and fluffy inside sealed in a paper-thin golden
   envelope. Drizzle with some maple syrup and serve with berries for a
   perfect morning! Pro Tips for Perfect french toast…
