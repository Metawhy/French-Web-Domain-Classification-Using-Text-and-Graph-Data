   Trees are renewable, so why not let them count under the proposed
   revisions to the EU renewable energy target? Here we answer this and
   other questions to demonstrate why burning trees for energy is not
   inherently climate-friendly.

What is the EU renewable energy target and its relevance to trees?

   The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive establishes an
   overall policy for advancing the use of energy from renewable sources
   in the EU. The current framework requires the EU to meet at least 20
   percent of its total energy needs with renewables by 2020. Wood is
   currently the largest contributor to this renewable energy target,
   accounting for as much as 45 percent of all renewable energy consumed.
   Much of the forest biomass currently used consists of industrial and
   harvest residues and traditional fuelwood. However, these sources are
   nearing full exploitation and further demand for wood for bioenergy
   will likely come from additional tree harvesting. Even now, Europe is
   importing wood pellets from U.S. and Canadian forests. Proposals
   currently under discussion by the European Parliament for a revised
   Renewable Energy Directive would increase the share of renewable energy
   in the EU’s total energy mix from 20 percent to at least 27 percent,
   and possibly 30–35 percent, by 2030. This proposal would likely
   increase demand to turn trees into energy as EU countries seek ways to
   meet these more ambitious renewable energy targets.

Why aren’t trees a climate-friendly energy source?

   There is a common perception that burning trees to generate heat or
   electricity should be considered “zero emissions” or “carbon neutral”
   because the carbon dioxide (CO[2]) released during burning is either
   recaptured by photosynthesis as trees regrow, or the CO[2] already
   sequestered by trees cancels out the emissions. The reality, however,
   is more complex for the following reasons:
     * When burned, trees generate more CO[2] emissions per unit of energy
       generated than fossil fuels. An oft overlooked fact is that burning
       wood emits more CO[2] than fossil fuels per megawatt-hour (MWh) of
       electricity generated or per unit of heat generated. For example,
       per data from Laganière et al. (2017), smokestack CO[2] emissions
       from combusting wood for heat can be 2.5 times higher than those of
       natural gas and 30 percent higher than those of coal per unit of
       generated energy. In terms of electricity generation, smokestack
       emissions from combusting wood can be more than three times higher
       than those of natural gas, and 1.5 times those of coal per MWh.

     * There is a carbon sequestration opportunity cost. Harvesting trees
       for energy releases carbon that would otherwise have remained
       stored in the forest. It also forgoes future carbon sequestration
       that otherwise would have occurred had the trees been allowed to
       continue growing.
     * The re-sequestration of the released carbon back into biomass is
       not instantaneous. It takes a long time for the CO[2] emissions
       from burning trees to be re-absorbed in new additional biomass.

   Because of the combination of these factors, it takes a long time
   before the CO[2 ]absorbed by additional tree regrowth offsets the
   increase in CO[2] emissions associated with burning wood for energy
   (relative to the emissions generated by burning fossil fuels to yield
   an equivalent amount of energy). As a result, the increase in
   atmospheric CO[2 ]emissions from burning trees for energy persists for
   many years. This delay before atmospheric CO[2] benefits are achieved
   is referred to as carbon payback time—”when preharvest carbon levels
   are reached (absolute carbon balance)”—or as time to carbon
   parity—”when comparing carbon levels to a reference case [such as when
   fossil fuels are burned and the trees remain growing] (relative C
   balance).” The payback time varies according to where trees are grown,
   type of energy generation facility, and type of fossil fuel being
   replaced, among other factors. In the case of mature forests, there may
   never be a complete payback, if the replanted forest is regularly
   harvested.

How long are carbon payback periods?

   Several studies indicate that the carbon payback periods can be on the
   order of decades to more than a century, varying by forest type and the
   fossil fuel being compared against. Payback periods in this range are
   summarized by the European Joint Research Centre (2014), which draws
   from a half-dozen studies covering temperate and boreal forests from
   Europe, Canada, and the United States. Another example is Laganière et
   al. (2017), which analyzed carbon payback periods for various bioenergy
   feedstocks sourced from Canadian forests relative to coal-, oil-, and
   natural gas-fired power and heat generation. Figure 1 summarizes their
   results, with each black bar indicating the number of years that
   bioenergy results in increased CO[2] levels in the atmosphere relative
   to the fossil fuel alternative.

   [Source: Laganière et al. 2017. “Range and Uncertainties in Estimating
   Delays in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential of Forest Bioenergy
   Sourced from Canadian Forests.” Global Change Biology Bioenergy 9 (2):
   358–69.]


   Among other studies coming to similar conclusions, Mitchell et al.
   (2012) analyzed an even broader set of forests and harvesting regimes
   and found most options to have payback times of more than 100 years,
   with the fastest payback times for a limited number of forest types and
   management regimes being at least 30 years. The science office of the
   Department of Energy & Climate Change in the United Kingdom had similar
   findings.

Why does the time delay to carbon payback matter?

   Burning biomass for energy releases a big “pulse” of CO[2] into the
   atmosphere relative to what would otherwise have been emitted if the
   power generator had continued to use fossil fuels. But the world needs
   to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the coming three
   decades and peak global emissions as soon as possible, if it is to stay
   below a 2°C temperature rise relative to pre-industrial levels, let
   alone below a 1.5°C rise. There is a significant environmental cost to
   delaying greenhouse gas emission reductions, as recognized by the fifth
   assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Now
   is not the time to increase atmospheric CO[2] concentrations over
   decadal or century timescales.

But won’t trees that are already growing elsewhere re-absorb the CO[2]
released from harvesting and burning trees, “offsetting” the emissions?

   No. Those trees growing elsewhere would have grown anyway in the
   counterfactual situation where fossil energy was burned instead of
   wood. Thus, their absorption of CO[2 ]is not “additional” and cannot be
   counted as an offset for absorbing the CO[2] released by burning trees
   for energy.

But haven’t trees used for bioenergy already absorbed CO[2], so their
emissions are not “new”?

   Some people argue that it is okay to cut down and burn trees because
   the trees have already absorbed carbon from the atmosphere during their
   growing phase. In other words, they argue that burning trees for energy
   should be credited for the carbon that the same trees absorbed when
   they grew. However, as far as the atmosphere is concerned, the carbon
   stored by trees is in the trees, and not in the atmosphere. Cutting
   down and burning the trees converts this carbon into CO[2], increasing
   the concentration of CO[2] in the atmosphere. Meeting global
   temperature goals requires keeping the carbon sequestered in trees for
   as long as possible.

Are there any tree-based feedstocks that could be beneficial from an
atmospheric CO[2 ]perspective?

   Some sources of bioenergy have shorter carbon payback periods. These
   include various forms of tree-based residues and wastes, including
   forest slash left over after harvest, black liquor from paper making,
   unused sawdust, and urban wood waste.

Have others arrived at similar conclusions?

   Yes. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Science Advisory Board
   concluded in 2012 that bioenergy is not inherently “carbon neutral” in
   the near term. Support for this conclusion was expressed in a letter
   from more than 90 leading U.S. scientists. A European Environment
   Agency Scientific Committee came to a similar conclusion when giving
   advice on greenhouse gas accounting in relation to bioenergy. A number
   of other papers have found that burning stem wood increases CO[2]
   emissions for at least decades, including the following:

       761–72.

What should the EU do with the revised Renewable Energy Directive?

   First, the EU should pass an amendment to the Renewable Energy
   Directive to limit the definition of renewable biomass from forests to
   residues and wastes. The current sustainability criteria for bioenergy
   proposed by the European Commission do not ensure that use of bioenergy
   results in CO[2] reduction benefits over fossil fuel alternatives in
   climate-relevant timescales. Second, the EU should phase out subsidies
   and incentives for the use of stemwood and stumps. Tree-based wastes
   and residues should benefit from subsidies or incentives only if they
   have no major alternative uses. In practice, the quantity of biomass
   that results in CO[2] benefits for the atmosphere is likely to be
   limited relative to the total demand for renewable energy.

   The enhanced EU renewable energy target should instead be met by
   increased investments in wind, solar, and other zero-emitting energy
   sources with unambiguous climate benefits. And efforts to increase
   energy efficiency should be strengthened.

   If the EU does not restrict biomass to genuinely CO[2]-friendly
   feedstocks, other countries will likely adopt similarly lax regulations
   that allow trees to be used as renewable energy sources—with
   significant negative consequences for forests and climate.

   A new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   shows that half a degree of warming matters—a lot.

   As part of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, countries
   committed to keep global warming well below 2˚C (3.6˚F) above
   pre-industrial levels while trying to limit temperature increase to
   1.5˚C (2.7˚F). Based on a request by governments, the IPCC, a
   collection of world’s leading climate scientists, took stock of how the
   impacts of a 1.5˚C temperature limit differ from 2˚C, as well as the
   differences between emissions pathways for achieving these two
   temperature goals. Their findings show that the world will face severe
   climate impacts even with 1.5 degrees of warming, and the effects get
   significantly worse with 2 degrees. The world has already witnessed
   about 1˚C of temperature rise and is on track to exhaust the carbon
   budget associated with 1.5˚C by 2030.

   Here’s a breakdown of the differences between a 1.5˚C and a 2˚C world:

Extreme Temperature

   Average and extreme temperatures will be higher in all inhabited areas
   under 2°C of warming versus 1.5°C. For example, under 1.5°C of warming,
   almost 14 percent of the world’s population would be exposed to severe
   heat waves at least once in five years. In contrast, under 2°C of
   warming, 37 percent of the world’s population would be exposed to
   severe heat waves at least once in five years.

Drought

   The probability of drought and risks to water availability may be
   substantially reduced if warming is limited to 1.5°C. For example, the
   risk of increased drought magnitude and frequency are significantly
   larger under 2°C of warming in the Mediterranean and southern Africa
   than under 1.5°C.

     * The World Is On Track to Exceed its "Carbon Budget" in 12 Years

Heavy Precipitation and Flooding

   High latitude and mountainous regions, as well as Eastern Asia and
   Eastern North America, are projected to experience heavier
   precipitation under 2°C of warming than under 1.5°C.  While 1.5°C can
   lead to increased runoff and floods in some regions compared to today’s
   conditions, 2°C could lead to even more.

Ice-Free Arctic

   With 1.5°C, the report finds it is very likely to have one sea-ice-free
   summer every 100 years; at 2°C, the frequency increases to at least one
   every 10 years. This can lead to more heat being absorbed, impacts to
   ocean circulation, and have consequence for winter weather in the
   Northern hemisphere.

Sea Level Rise

   With 1.5°C of warming, sea level rise would be 0.4 meters (1.3 feet) in
   2100, compared to levels in 1986-2005. At 2°C, it would be 0.46 m (1.5
   ft) in 2100.

   The risk of flooding is also greater with a higher temperature rise.
   With 1.5°C of warming by 2100, up to 69 million people could be exposed
   to flooding (assuming no adaptation and current population). Up to 79
   million could be exposed under 2°C of warming.

   Also, if the rate of sea level rise is slower, there can be more
   opportunities for communities to adapt.

Species Loss

   At 2ºC warming, 18 percent of insects globally, 16 percent of plants
   and 8 percent of vertebrates are projected to lose more than half of
   their ranges. With 1.5°C of warming, this is reduced by two-thirds for
   insects, and by half for plants and vertebrates.

   Other factors that lead to losses of species, such as forest fires and
   the spread of pests and diseases, also decrease if warming stays at
   1.5°C.

Terrestrial Ecosystems

   Ecosystems are expected to transform with greater warming. For example,
   under 2°C of warming, 13 percent of the Earth’s land area is projected
   to witness biome shifts (such as changing from tundra to forest), or
   transformation. With 1.5°C of warming, this risk is lowered to 4
   percent of Earth’s land area.

   Under higher temperatures, permafrost is at a much greater risk for
   melting, which would lead to the release of its stored carbon into the
   atmosphere.

   With warming of 2°C, 35-47 percent of the Arctic’s permafrost would
   thaw by 2100, an area of land that is three-quarters the size of
   Australia. If warming is limited to 1.5°C, the extent of thawing
   permafrost drops to 4.8 million km2. or about 21-37 percent of the
   total permafrost area..

Oceans

   Ocean ecosystems are already transforming and will change dramatically
   with just 1.5°C of warming. However, limiting warming to 1.5°C can
   stave off many of the impacts that higher temperatures would bring.

   For example, coral reefs are projected to decline by 70-90 percent with
   warming greater than 1.5°C. With an additional half degree of warming,
   more than 99 percent losses are expected. Loss of fishery productivity
   at low latitudes, acidification, dead zones and other dangerous
   conditions are projected to be more pronounced with warming higher than
   1.5°C. For example, one study cited in the report found that the global
   annual catch from marine fisheries declined by 1.5 million tonnes under
   1.5°C of warming; under 2°C. that loss grew to 3 million tonnes.

Food Security

   The risks of food shortages are projected to be lower in the Sahel,
   southern African, Mediterranean and Amazon regions under 1.5 °C of
   warming than they would be at 2°C of warming. Fisheries and aquaculture
   also experience lower risks if warming stays at 1.5°C.

Health

   Risks to human health, including heat-related morbidity and mortality
   in urban areas, are lower with 1.5°C of warming than 2°C.

Economic Growth

   Economic losses are greater as temperatures rise, with middle income
   countries (Africa, southeast Asia, India, Brazil, Mexico) projected to
   be affected the most. For example, if warming is limited to 1.5°C,
   global GDP losses will be 0.3 percent by 2100. With 2°C of warming,
   losses would be 0.5 percent.

How much harder is it to limit warming to 1.5˚C vs. 2˚C ?

   Meeting both the 1.5°C and 2°C limit will require unprecedented
   transformation across all economies, industries and geographies.

   For limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the world
   will need to reduce its annual emissions to 25-30 GtCO2e on average in
   2030. The world is currently on track to emit more than double this
   amount by 2030 (52-58 GtCO2e). Limiting warming to 2°C would require
   reducing annual emissions by about 20 percent below 2010 levels in
   2030; for 1.5°C, emissions will need to drop by 40-50 percent. Carbon
   dioxide emissions will need to reach net-zero around 2050 to limit
   warming to 1.5°C and around 2075 for 2°C.

Setting Sights on 1.5˚C

   Achieving 2˚C will avoid many catastrophic impacts from climate change,
   but the consequences will be significantly worse than if we can limit
   global warming to 1.5˚C. Adaptation needs also grow as temperature
   rises. Saving this half a degree will require tremendous effort. But as
   the report today shows, the effort will be well worth the reward of
   more secure communities, ecosystems and economies.

   Trees are renewable, so why not let them count under the proposed
   revisions to the EU renewable energy target? Here we answer this and
   other questions to demonstrate why burning trees for energy is not
   inherently climate-friendly.

What is the EU renewable energy target and its relevance to trees?

   The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive establishes an
   overall policy for advancing the use of energy from renewable sources
   in the EU. The current framework requires the EU to meet at least 20
   percent of its total energy needs with renewables by 2020. Wood is
   currently the largest contributor to this renewable energy target,
   accounting for as much as 45 percent of all renewable energy consumed.
   Much of the forest biomass currently used consists of industrial and
   harvest residues and traditional fuelwood. However, these sources are
   nearing full exploitation and further demand for wood for bioenergy
   will likely come from additional tree harvesting. Even now, Europe is
   importing wood pellets from U.S. and Canadian forests. Proposals
   currently under discussion by the European Parliament for a revised
   Renewable Energy Directive would increase the share of renewable energy
   in the EU’s total energy mix from 20 percent to at least 27 percent,
   and possibly 30–35 percent, by 2030. This proposal would likely
   increase demand to turn trees into energy as EU countries seek ways to
   meet these more ambitious renewable energy targets.

Why aren’t trees a climate-friendly energy source?

   There is a common perception that burning trees to generate heat or
   electricity should be considered “zero emissions” or “carbon neutral”
   because the carbon dioxide (CO[2]) released during burning is either
   recaptured by photosynthesis as trees regrow, or the CO[2] already
   sequestered by trees cancels out the emissions. The reality, however,
   is more complex for the following reasons:
     * When burned, trees generate more CO[2] emissions per unit of energy
       generated than fossil fuels. An oft overlooked fact is that burning
       wood emits more CO[2] than fossil fuels per megawatt-hour (MWh) of
       electricity generated or per unit of heat generated. For example,
       per data from Laganière et al. (2017), smokestack CO[2] emissions
       from combusting wood for heat can be 2.5 times higher than those of
       natural gas and 30 percent higher than those of coal per unit of
       generated energy. In terms of electricity generation, smokestack
       emissions from combusting wood can be more than three times higher
       than those of natural gas, and 1.5 times those of coal per MWh.

     * There is a carbon sequestration opportunity cost. Harvesting trees
       for energy releases carbon that would otherwise have remained
       stored in the forest. It also forgoes future carbon sequestration
       that otherwise would have occurred had the trees been allowed to
       continue growing.
     * The re-sequestration of the released carbon back into biomass is
       not instantaneous. It takes a long time for the CO[2] emissions
       from burning trees to be re-absorbed in new additional biomass.

   Because of the combination of these factors, it takes a long time
   before the CO[2 ]absorbed by additional tree regrowth offsets the
   increase in CO[2] emissions associated with burning wood for energy
   (relative to the emissions generated by burning fossil fuels to yield
   an equivalent amount of energy). As a result, the increase in
   atmospheric CO[2 ]emissions from burning trees for energy persists for
   many years. This delay before atmospheric CO[2] benefits are achieved
   is referred to as carbon payback time—”when preharvest carbon levels
   are reached (absolute carbon balance)”—or as time to carbon
   parity—”when comparing carbon levels to a reference case [such as when
   fossil fuels are burned and the trees remain growing] (relative C
   balance).” The payback time varies according to where trees are grown,
   type of energy generation facility, and type of fossil fuel being
   replaced, among other factors. In the case of mature forests, there may
   never be a complete payback, if the replanted forest is regularly
   harvested.

How long are carbon payback periods?

   Several studies indicate that the carbon payback periods can be on the
   order of decades to more than a century, varying by forest type and the
   fossil fuel being compared against. Payback periods in this range are
   summarized by the European Joint Research Centre (2014), which draws
   from a half-dozen studies covering temperate and boreal forests from
   Europe, Canada, and the United States. Another example is Laganière et
   al. (2017), which analyzed carbon payback periods for various bioenergy
   feedstocks sourced from Canadian forests relative to coal-, oil-, and
   natural gas-fired power and heat generation. Figure 1 summarizes their
   results, with each black bar indicating the number of years that
   bioenergy results in increased CO[2] levels in the atmosphere relative
   to the fossil fuel alternative.


    Figure 1. Carbon Payback Periods for Bioenergy from Canadian Forests

   [Key
   Black = period with net carbon losses
   Yellow = possible additional payback times depending on various
   management choices
   Green = period with net carbon gains
   * That otherwise would have been burned or left to decompose]

   [Source: Laganière et al. 2017. “Range and Uncertainties in Estimating
   Delays in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential of Forest Bioenergy
   Sourced from Canadian Forests.” Global Change Biology Bioenergy 9 (2):
   358–69.]


   Among other studies coming to similar conclusions, Mitchell et al.
   (2012) analyzed an even broader set of forests and harvesting regimes
   and found most options to have payback times of more than 100 years,
   with the fastest payback times for a limited number of forest types and
   management regimes being at least 30 years. The science office of the
   Department of Energy & Climate Change in the United Kingdom had similar
   findings.

Why does the time delay to carbon payback matter?

   Burning biomass for energy releases a big “pulse” of CO[2] into the
   atmosphere relative to what would otherwise have been emitted if the
   power generator had continued to use fossil fuels. But the world needs
   to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the coming three
   decades and peak global emissions as soon as possible, if it is to stay
   below a 2°C temperature rise relative to pre-industrial levels, let
   alone below a 1.5°C rise. There is a significant environmental cost to
   delaying greenhouse gas emission reductions, as recognized by the fifth
   assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Now
   is not the time to increase atmospheric CO[2] concentrations over
   decadal or century timescales.

But won’t trees that are already growing elsewhere re-absorb the CO[2]
released from harvesting and burning trees, “offsetting” the emissions?

   No. Those trees growing elsewhere would have grown anyway in the
   counterfactual situation where fossil energy was burned instead of
   wood. Thus, their absorption of CO[2 ]is not “additional” and cannot be
   counted as an offset for absorbing the CO[2] released by burning trees
   for energy.

But haven’t trees used for bioenergy already absorbed CO[2], so their
emissions are not “new”?

   Some people argue that it is okay to cut down and burn trees because
   the trees have already absorbed carbon from the atmosphere during their
   growing phase. In other words, they argue that burning trees for energy
   should be credited for the carbon that the same trees absorbed when
   they grew. However, as far as the atmosphere is concerned, the carbon
   stored by trees is in the trees, and not in the atmosphere. Cutting
   down and burning the trees converts this carbon into CO[2], increasing
   the concentration of CO[2] in the atmosphere. Meeting global
   temperature goals requires keeping the carbon sequestered in trees for
   as long as possible.

Are there any tree-based feedstocks that could be beneficial from an
atmospheric CO[2 ]perspective?

   Some sources of bioenergy have shorter carbon payback periods. These
   include various forms of tree-based residues and wastes, including
   forest slash left over after harvest, black liquor from paper making,
   unused sawdust, and urban wood waste.

Have others arrived at similar conclusions?

   Yes. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Science Advisory Board
   concluded in 2012 that bioenergy is not inherently “carbon neutral” in
   the near term. Support for this conclusion was expressed in a letter
   from more than 90 leading U.S. scientists. A European Environment
   Agency Scientific Committee came to a similar conclusion when giving
   advice on greenhouse gas accounting in relation to bioenergy. A number
   of other papers have found that burning stem wood increases CO[2]
   emissions for at least decades, including the following:

       761–72.

What should the EU do with the revised Renewable Energy Directive?

   First, the EU should pass an amendment to the Renewable Energy
   Directive to limit the definition of renewable biomass from forests to
   residues and wastes. The current sustainability criteria for bioenergy
   proposed by the European Commission do not ensure that use of bioenergy
   results in CO[2] reduction benefits over fossil fuel alternatives in
   climate-relevant timescales. Second, the EU should phase out subsidies
   and incentives for the use of stemwood and stumps. Tree-based wastes
   and residues should benefit from subsidies or incentives only if they
   have no major alternative uses. In practice, the quantity of biomass
   that results in CO[2] benefits for the atmosphere is likely to be
   limited relative to the total demand for renewable energy.

   The enhanced EU renewable energy target should instead be met by
   increased investments in wind, solar, and other zero-emitting energy
   sources with unambiguous climate benefits. And efforts to increase
   energy efficiency should be strengthened.

   If the EU does not restrict biomass to genuinely CO[2]-friendly
   feedstocks, other countries will likely adopt similarly lax regulations
   that allow trees to be used as renewable energy sources—with
   significant negative consequences for forests and climate.

   A new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   shows that half a degree of warming matters—a lot.

   As part of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, countries
   committed to keep global warming well below 2˚C (3.6˚F) above
   pre-industrial levels while trying to limit temperature increase to
   1.5˚C (2.7˚F). Based on a request by governments, the IPCC, a
   collection of world’s leading climate scientists, took stock of how the
   impacts of a 1.5˚C temperature limit differ from 2˚C, as well as the
   differences between emissions pathways for achieving these two
   temperature goals. Their findings show that the world will face severe
   climate impacts even with 1.5 degrees of warming, and the effects get
   significantly worse with 2 degrees. The world has already witnessed
   about 1˚C of temperature rise and is on track to exhaust the carbon
   budget associated with 1.5˚C by 2030.

   Here’s a breakdown of the differences between a 1.5˚C and a 2˚C world:

Extreme Temperature

   Average and extreme temperatures will be higher in all inhabited areas
   under 2°C of warming versus 1.5°C. For example, under 1.5°C of warming,
   almost 14 percent of the world’s population would be exposed to severe
   heat waves at least once in five years. In contrast, under 2°C of
   warming, 37 percent of the world’s population would be exposed to
   severe heat waves at least once in five years.

Drought

   The probability of drought and risks to water availability may be
   substantially reduced if warming is limited to 1.5°C. For example, the
   risk of increased drought magnitude and frequency are significantly
   larger under 2°C of warming in the Mediterranean and southern Africa
   than under 1.5°C.

     * The World Is On Track to Exceed its "Carbon Budget" in 12 Years

Heavy Precipitation and Flooding

   High latitude and mountainous regions, as well as Eastern Asia and
   Eastern North America, are projected to experience heavier
   precipitation under 2°C of warming than under 1.5°C.  While 1.5°C can
   lead to increased runoff and floods in some regions compared to today’s
   conditions, 2°C could lead to even more.

Ice-Free Arctic

   With 1.5°C, the report finds it is very likely to have one sea-ice-free
   summer every 100 years; at 2°C, the frequency increases to at least one
   every 10 years. This can lead to more heat being absorbed, impacts to
   ocean circulation, and have consequence for winter weather in the
   Northern hemisphere.

Sea Level Rise

   With 1.5°C of warming, sea level rise would be 0.4 meters (1.3 feet) in
   2100, compared to levels in 1986-2005. At 2°C, it would be 0.46 m (1.5
   ft) in 2100.

   The risk of flooding is also greater with a higher temperature rise.
   With 1.5°C of warming by 2100, up to 69 million people could be exposed
   to flooding (assuming no adaptation and current population). Up to 79
   million could be exposed under 2°C of warming.

   Also, if the rate of sea level rise is slower, there can be more
   opportunities for communities to adapt.

Species Loss

   At 2ºC warming, 18 percent of insects globally, 16 percent of plants
   and 8 percent of vertebrates are projected to lose more than half of
   their ranges. With 1.5°C of warming, this is reduced by two-thirds for
   insects, and by half for plants and vertebrates.

   Other factors that lead to losses of species, such as forest fires and
   the spread of pests and diseases, also decrease if warming stays at
   1.5°C.

Terrestrial Ecosystems

   Ecosystems are expected to transform with greater warming. For example,
   under 2°C of warming, 13 percent of the Earth’s land area is projected
   to witness biome shifts (such as changing from tundra to forest), or
   transformation. With 1.5°C of warming, this risk is lowered to 4
   percent of Earth’s land area.

   Under higher temperatures, permafrost is at a much greater risk for
   melting, which would lead to the release of its stored carbon into the
   atmosphere.

   With warming of 2°C, 35-47 percent of the Arctic’s permafrost would
   thaw by 2100, an area of land that is three-quarters the size of
   Australia. If warming is limited to 1.5°C, the extent of thawing
   permafrost drops to 4.8 million km2. or about 21-37 percent of the
   total permafrost area..

Oceans

   Ocean ecosystems are already transforming and will change dramatically
   with just 1.5°C of warming. However, limiting warming to 1.5°C can
   stave off many of the impacts that higher temperatures would bring.

   For example, coral reefs are projected to decline by 70-90 percent with
   warming greater than 1.5°C. With an additional half degree of warming,
   more than 99 percent losses are expected. Loss of fishery productivity
   at low latitudes, acidification, dead zones and other dangerous
   conditions are projected to be more pronounced with warming higher than
   1.5°C. For example, one study cited in the report found that the global
   annual catch from marine fisheries declined by 1.5 million tonnes under
   1.5°C of warming; under 2°C. that loss grew to 3 million tonnes.

Food Security

   The risks of food shortages are projected to be lower in the Sahel,
   southern African, Mediterranean and Amazon regions under 1.5 °C of
   warming than they would be at 2°C of warming. Fisheries and aquaculture
   also experience lower risks if warming stays at 1.5°C.

Health

   Risks to human health, including heat-related morbidity and mortality
   in urban areas, are lower with 1.5°C of warming than 2°C.

Economic Growth

   Economic losses are greater as temperatures rise, with middle income
   countries (Africa, southeast Asia, India, Brazil, Mexico) projected to
   be affected the most. For example, if warming is limited to 1.5°C,
   global GDP losses will be 0.3 percent by 2100. With 2°C of warming,
   losses would be 0.5 percent.

How much harder is it to limit warming to 1.5˚C vs. 2˚C ?

   Meeting both the 1.5°C and 2°C limit will require unprecedented
   transformation across all economies, industries and geographies.

   For limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the world
   will need to reduce its annual emissions to 25-30 GtCO2e on average in
   2030. The world is currently on track to emit more than double this
   amount by 2030 (52-58 GtCO2e). Limiting warming to 2°C would require
   reducing annual emissions by about 20 percent below 2010 levels in
   2030; for 1.5°C, emissions will need to drop by 40-50 percent. Carbon
   dioxide emissions will need to reach net-zero around 2050 to limit
   warming to 1.5°C and around 2075 for 2°C.

Setting Sights on 1.5˚C

   Achieving 2˚C will avoid many catastrophic impacts from climate change,
   but the consequences will be significantly worse than if we can limit
   global warming to 1.5˚C. Adaptation needs also grow as temperature
   rises. Saving this half a degree will require tremendous effort. But as
   the report today shows, the effort will be well worth the reward of
   more secure communities, ecosystems and economies.

INSIDER: Why Burning Trees for Energy Harms the Climate

   Trees are renewable, so why not let them count under the proposed
   revisions to the EU renewable energy target? Here we answer this and
   other questions to demonstrate why burning trees for energy is not
   inherently climate-friendly.

What is the EU renewable energy target and its relevance to trees?

   The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive establishes an
   overall policy for advancing the use of energy from renewable sources
   in the EU. The current framework requires the EU to meet at least 20
   percent of its total energy needs with renewables by 2020. Wood is
   currently the largest contributor to this renewable energy target,
   accounting for as much as 45 percent of all renewable energy consumed.
   Much of the forest biomass currently used consists of industrial and
   harvest residues and traditional fuelwood. However, these sources are
   nearing full exploitation and further demand for wood for bioenergy
   will likely come from additional tree harvesting. Even now, Europe is
   importing wood pellets from U.S. and Canadian forests. Proposals
   currently under discussion by the European Parliament for a revised
   Renewable Energy Directive would increase the share of renewable energy
   in the EU’s total energy mix from 20 percent to at least 27 percent,
   and possibly 30–35 percent, by 2030. This proposal would likely
   increase demand to turn trees into energy as EU countries seek ways to
   meet these more ambitious renewable energy targets.

Why aren’t trees a climate-friendly energy source?

   There is a common perception that burning trees to generate heat or
   electricity should be considered “zero emissions” or “carbon neutral”
   because the carbon dioxide (CO[2]) released during burning is either
   recaptured by photosynthesis as trees regrow, or the CO[2] already
   sequestered by trees cancels out the emissions. The reality, however,
   is more complex for the following reasons:
     * When burned, trees generate more CO[2] emissions per unit of energy
       generated than fossil fuels. An oft overlooked fact is that burning
       wood emits more CO[2] than fossil fuels per megawatt-hour (MWh) of
       electricity generated or per unit of heat generated. For example,
       per data from Laganière et al. (2017), smokestack CO[2] emissions
       from combusting wood for heat can be 2.5 times higher than those of
       natural gas and 30 percent higher than those of coal per unit of
       generated energy. In terms of electricity generation, smokestack
       emissions from combusting wood can be more than three times higher
       than those of natural gas, and 1.5 times those of coal per MWh.

     * There is a carbon sequestration opportunity cost. Harvesting trees
       for energy releases carbon that would otherwise have remained
       stored in the forest. It also forgoes future carbon sequestration
       that otherwise would have occurred had the trees been allowed to
       continue growing.
     * The re-sequestration of the released carbon back into biomass is
       not instantaneous. It takes a long time for the CO[2] emissions
       from burning trees to be re-absorbed in new additional biomass.

   Because of the combination of these factors, it takes a long time
   before the CO[2 ]absorbed by additional tree regrowth offsets the
   increase in CO[2] emissions associated with burning wood for energy
   (relative to the emissions generated by burning fossil fuels to yield
   an equivalent amount of energy). As a result, the increase in
   atmospheric CO[2 ]emissions from burning trees for energy persists for
   many years. This delay before atmospheric CO[2] benefits are achieved
   is referred to as carbon payback time—”when preharvest carbon levels
   are reached (absolute carbon balance)”—or as time to carbon
   parity—”when comparing carbon levels to a reference case [such as when
   fossil fuels are burned and the trees remain growing] (relative C
   balance).” The payback time varies according to where trees are grown,
   type of energy generation facility, and type of fossil fuel being
   replaced, among other factors. In the case of mature forests, there may
   never be a complete payback, if the replanted forest is regularly
   harvested.

How long are carbon payback periods?

   Several studies indicate that the carbon payback periods can be on the
   order of decades to more than a century, varying by forest type and the
   fossil fuel being compared against. Payback periods in this range are
   summarized by the European Joint Research Centre (2014), which draws
   from a half-dozen studies covering temperate and boreal forests from
   Europe, Canada, and the United States. Another example is Laganière et
   al. (2017), which analyzed carbon payback periods for various bioenergy
   feedstocks sourced from Canadian forests relative to coal-, oil-, and
   natural gas-fired power and heat generation. Figure 1 summarizes their
   results, with each black bar indicating the number of years that
   bioenergy results in increased CO[2] levels in the atmosphere relative
   to the fossil fuel alternative.

   Delays in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential of Forest Bioenergy
   Sourced from Canadian Forests.” Global Change Biology Bioenergy 9 (2):
   358–69.]


   Among other studies coming to similar conclusions, Mitchell et al.
   (2012) analyzed an even broader set of forests and harvesting regimes
   and found most options to have payback times of more than 100 years,
   with the fastest payback times for a limited number of forest types and
   management regimes being at least 30 years. The science office of the
   Department of Energy & Climate Change in the United Kingdom had similar
   findings.

Why does the time delay to carbon payback matter?

   Burning biomass for energy releases a big “pulse” of CO[2] into the
   atmosphere relative to what would otherwise have been emitted if the
   power generator had continued to use fossil fuels. But the world needs
   to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the coming three
   decades and peak global emissions as soon as possible, if it is to stay
   below a 2°C temperature rise relative to pre-industrial levels, let
   alone below a 1.5°C rise. There is a significant environmental cost to
   delaying greenhouse gas emission reductions, as recognized by the fifth
   assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Now
   is not the time to increase atmospheric CO[2] concentrations over
   decadal or century timescales.

But won’t trees that are already growing elsewhere re-absorb the CO[2]
released from harvesting and burning trees, “offsetting” the emissions?

   No. Those trees growing elsewhere would have grown anyway in the
   counterfactual situation where fossil energy was burned instead of
   wood. Thus, their absorption of CO[2 ]is not “additional” and cannot be
   counted as an offset for absorbing the CO[2] released by burning trees
   for energy.

But haven’t trees used for bioenergy already absorbed CO[2], so their
emissions are not “new”?

   Some people argue that it is okay to cut down and burn trees because
   the trees have already absorbed carbon from the atmosphere during their
   growing phase. In other words, they argue that burning trees for energy
   should be credited for the carbon that the same trees absorbed when
   they grew. However, as far as the atmosphere is concerned, the carbon
   stored by trees is in the trees, and not in the atmosphere. Cutting
   down and burning the trees converts this carbon into CO[2], increasing
   the concentration of CO[2] in the atmosphere. Meeting global
   temperature goals requires keeping the carbon sequestered in trees for
   as long as possible.

Are there any tree-based feedstocks that could be beneficial from an
atmospheric CO[2 ]perspective?

   Some sources of bioenergy have shorter carbon payback periods. These
   include various forms of tree-based residues and wastes, including
   forest slash left over after harvest, black liquor from paper making,
   unused sawdust, and urban wood waste.

Have others arrived at similar conclusions?

   Yes. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Science Advisory Board
   concluded in 2012 that bioenergy is not inherently “carbon neutral” in
   the near term. Support for this conclusion was expressed in a letter
   from more than 90 leading U.S. scientists. A European Environment
   Agency Scientific Committee came to a similar conclusion when giving
   advice on greenhouse gas accounting in relation to bioenergy. A number
   of other papers have found that burning stem wood increases CO[2]
   emissions for at least decades, including the following:

What should the EU do with the revised Renewable Energy Directive?

   First, the EU should pass an amendment to the Renewable Energy
   Directive to limit the definition of renewable biomass from forests to
   residues and wastes. The current sustainability criteria for bioenergy
   proposed by the European Commission do not ensure that use of bioenergy
   results in CO[2] reduction benefits over fossil fuel alternatives in
   climate-relevant timescales. Second, the EU should phase out subsidies
   and incentives for the use of stemwood and stumps. Tree-based wastes
   and residues should benefit from subsidies or incentives only if they
   have no major alternative uses. In practice, the quantity of biomass
   that results in CO[2] benefits for the atmosphere is likely to be
   limited relative to the total demand for renewable energy.

   The enhanced EU renewable energy target should instead be met by
   increased investments in wind, solar, and other zero-emitting energy
   sources with unambiguous climate benefits. And efforts to increase
   energy efficiency should be strengthened.

   If the EU does not restrict biomass to genuinely CO[2]-friendly
   feedstocks, other countries will likely adopt similarly lax regulations
   that allow trees to be used as renewable energy sources—with
   significant negative consequences for forests and climate.

   A new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   shows that half a degree of warming matters—a lot.

   As part of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, countries
   committed to keep global warming well below 2˚C (3.6˚F) above
   pre-industrial levels while trying to limit temperature increase to
   1.5˚C (2.7˚F). Based on a request by governments, the IPCC, a
   collection of world’s leading climate scientists, took stock of how the
   impacts of a 1.5˚C temperature limit differ from 2˚C, as well as the
   differences between emissions pathways for achieving these two
   temperature goals. Their findings show that the world will face severe
   climate impacts even with 1.5 degrees of warming, and the effects get
   significantly worse with 2 degrees. The world has already witnessed
   about 1˚C of temperature rise and is on track to exhaust the carbon
   budget associated with 1.5˚C by 2030.

   Here’s a breakdown of the differences between a 1.5˚C and a 2˚C world:

Extreme Temperature

   Average and extreme temperatures will be higher in all inhabited areas
   under 2°C of warming versus 1.5°C. For example, under 1.5°C of warming,
   almost 14 percent of the world’s population would be exposed to severe
   heat waves at least once in five years. In contrast, under 2°C of
   warming, 37 percent of the world’s population would be exposed to
   severe heat waves at least once in five years.

Drought

   The probability of drought and risks to water availability may be
   substantially reduced if warming is limited to 1.5°C. For example, the
   risk of increased drought magnitude and frequency are significantly
   larger under 2°C of warming in the Mediterranean and southern Africa
   than under 1.5°C.

     * The World Is On Track to Exceed its "Carbon Budget" in 12 Years

Heavy Precipitation and Flooding

   High latitude and mountainous regions, as well as Eastern Asia and
   Eastern North America, are projected to experience heavier
   precipitation under 2°C of warming than under 1.5°C.  While 1.5°C can
   lead to increased runoff and floods in some regions compared to today’s
   conditions, 2°C could lead to even more.

Ice-Free Arctic

   With 1.5°C, the report finds it is very likely to have one sea-ice-free
   summer every 100 years; at 2°C, the frequency increases to at least one
   every 10 years. This can lead to more heat being absorbed, impacts to
   ocean circulation, and have consequence for winter weather in the
   Northern hemisphere.

Sea Level Rise

   With 1.5°C of warming, sea level rise would be 0.4 meters (1.3 feet) in
   2100, compared to levels in 1986-2005. At 2°C, it would be 0.46 m (1.5
   ft) in 2100.

   The risk of flooding is also greater with a higher temperature rise.
   With 1.5°C of warming by 2100, up to 69 million people could be exposed
   to flooding (assuming no adaptation and current population). Up to 79
   million could be exposed under 2°C of warming.

   Also, if the rate of sea level rise is slower, there can be more
   opportunities for communities to adapt.

Species Loss

   At 2ºC warming, 18 percent of insects globally, 16 percent of plants
   and 8 percent of vertebrates are projected to lose more than half of
   their ranges. With 1.5°C of warming, this is reduced by two-thirds for
   insects, and by half for plants and vertebrates.

   Other factors that lead to losses of species, such as forest fires and
   the spread of pests and diseases, also decrease if warming stays at
   1.5°C.

Terrestrial Ecosystems

   Ecosystems are expected to transform with greater warming. For example,
   under 2°C of warming, 13 percent of the Earth’s land area is projected
   to witness biome shifts (such as changing from tundra to forest), or
   transformation. With 1.5°C of warming, this risk is lowered to 4
   percent of Earth’s land area.

   Under higher temperatures, permafrost is at a much greater risk for
   melting, which would lead to the release of its stored carbon into the
   atmosphere.

   With warming of 2°C, 35-47 percent of the Arctic’s permafrost would
   thaw by 2100, an area of land that is three-quarters the size of
   Australia. If warming is limited to 1.5°C, the extent of thawing
   permafrost drops to 4.8 million km2. or about 21-37 percent of the
   total permafrost area..

Oceans

   Ocean ecosystems are already transforming and will change dramatically
   with just 1.5°C of warming. However, limiting warming to 1.5°C can
   stave off many of the impacts that higher temperatures would bring.

   For example, coral reefs are projected to decline by 70-90 percent with
   warming greater than 1.5°C. With an additional half degree of warming,
   more than 99 percent losses are expected. Loss of fishery productivity
   at low latitudes, acidification, dead zones and other dangerous
   conditions are projected to be more pronounced with warming higher than
   1.5°C. For example, one study cited in the report found that the global
   annual catch from marine fisheries declined by 1.5 million tonnes under
   1.5°C of warming; under 2°C. that loss grew to 3 million tonnes.

Food Security

   The risks of food shortages are projected to be lower in the Sahel,
   southern African, Mediterranean and Amazon regions under 1.5 °C of
   warming than they would be at 2°C of warming. Fisheries and aquaculture
   also experience lower risks if warming stays at 1.5°C.

Health

   Risks to human health, including heat-related morbidity and mortality
   in urban areas, are lower with 1.5°C of warming than 2°C.

Economic Growth

   Economic losses are greater as temperatures rise, with middle income
   countries (Africa, southeast Asia, India, Brazil, Mexico) projected to
   be affected the most. For example, if warming is limited to 1.5°C,
   global GDP losses will be 0.3 percent by 2100. With 2°C of warming,
   losses would be 0.5 percent.

How much harder is it to limit warming to 1.5˚C vs. 2˚C ?

   Meeting both the 1.5°C and 2°C limit will require unprecedented
   transformation across all economies, industries and geographies.

   For limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the world
   will need to reduce its annual emissions to 25-30 GtCO2e on average in
   2030. The world is currently on track to emit more than double this
   amount by 2030 (52-58 GtCO2e). Limiting warming to 2°C would require
   reducing annual emissions by about 20 percent below 2010 levels in
   2030; for 1.5°C, emissions will need to drop by 40-50 percent. Carbon
   dioxide emissions will need to reach net-zero around 2050 to limit
   warming to 1.5°C and around 2075 for 2°C.

Setting Sights on 1.5˚C

   Achieving 2˚C will avoid many catastrophic impacts from climate change,
   but the consequences will be significantly worse than if we can limit
   global warming to 1.5˚C. Adaptation needs also grow as temperature
   rises. Saving this half a degree will require tremendous effort. But as
   the report today shows, the effort will be well worth the reward of
   more secure communities, ecosystems and economies.
