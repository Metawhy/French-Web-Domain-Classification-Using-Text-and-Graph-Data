Farm Activities Using Free Printables for a Montessori-Inspired Farm Unit

   By Deb Chitwood from Living Montessori Now
   It's time to expand another fun, popular unit for preschoolers ... our
   Montessori-inspired farm unit! I've added a lot of free farm printables
   and activities along with a free farm pack (subscriber freebie at
   LivingMontessoriNow.com)!
   [Free%2BFarm%2BPrintables%2Band%2BActivities%2Bfor%2Ba%2BMontessori-Ins
   pired%2BFarm%2BUnit.jpg]
   You'll find many activities for preschoolers through first graders
   throughout the year along with presentation ideas in my previous posts
   at PreK + K Sharing. You'll also find ideas for using free printables
   to create activity trays here: How to Use Printables to Create
   Montessori-Inspired Activities.
   At Living Montessori Now, I have a post with resource links of Free
   Printables for Montessori Homeschools and Preschools.
   Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links (at no cost to you).

Montessori Shelves with Farm-Themed Activities

   Montessori Shelves with Farm-Themed Activities
   You’ll find Montessori-inspired farm numbers, letters, and and more
   (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to
   get the link and password … or check the bottom of your latest
   newsletter if you’re already a subscriber)
   I always have related books available throughout a unit. On the top
   shelf, I have two classic and endearing Montessori-friendly books: Our
   Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm and The Year at Maple Hill Farm.
   On the right side of the shelf ( book on a wooden cookbook holder), I
   have DK Smithsonian Picturepedia (beautiful photos and a fabulous
   reference book I use for many, many units!).
   You could mix your farm-themed activities among your shelves according
   to curriculum area. Or you could have a special farm-themed area
   something like the one pictured. My shelves this month have a mixture
   of skill levels mainly from toddler through first grade. Many of the
   activities can be adapted for a variety of levels. If you’re a
   homeschooler, just choose the activities that work for your child’s
   interests and ability levels. If you don’t have room for all the
   activities you’d like to do, simply rotate them.

Safari Ltd Farm Animals and Key with Maple Hill Farm Books

   Safari Ltd Farm Animals and Key with Maple Hill Farm Books
   Free Printable: Safari Ltd. Farm TOOB Key
   These animals are from the Safari Ltd. Farm TOOB, although a variety of
   farm TOOBS are available. Matching the figures to the TOOB keys is a
   simple-to-prepare activity that's great for toddlers and young
   preschoolers.

Farm Booklet

   Free Printable: Farm Booklet (Farm Picture-Word Cards) from PreKinders
   This is next to the open Picturepedia book on the top shelf. It's so
   easy to prepare! Just print and cut it out. The printable even has
   places to punch holes to make a booklet using a binder ring.

Farm Books, Spanish Farm Animal 3-Part Cards, and Schleich Farm Animals


   Free Printable: Spanish 3-Part Cards from Totschooling at Teachers Pay
   Teachers
   The materials were easy to prepare. I display them simply on a
   Multicraft tray with the added Montessori cards display box (which I
   love and typically use for all my 3-part cards now). I used Schleich
   farm animals.
   There are eight Spanish farm animal cards in the printable (along with
   many other Spanish words), although I just started with six of the
   cards.
   My toddler grandkids love My First Farm: Let's Get Working! (and the
   rest of the series). National Geographic Kids Farm Animals has
   easy-to-understand facts and gorgeous photographs.
   Because of the Spanish vocabulary, this can be used for multiple ages.
   Matching Farm Animal Objects to Pictures
   My 18-month-old grandson, Caleb, and 21-month-old granddaughter,
   Sophia, are learning some Spanish vocabulary, so Caleb's mom,
   Christina, introduced them to the Spanish words while they matched the
   animals to the pictures.
   Looking at the Farm: Let's Get Working! Book After Farm Animal Matching
   Activity
   Caleb and Sophia didn't use the Spanish word cards, although those
   would be perfect for my 5½-year-old granddaughter, Zoey.

Manuscript and Cursive Writing and Spelling Materials

   It's a personal preference if you like to introduce manuscript or
   cursive first. Many Montessorians introduce cursive first, and many
   Montessorians introduce manuscript first. It often depends on what your
   child will be encountering most. When I was a Montessori teacher, my
   students went on to traditional schools, so I always introduced print
   first. I did the same with my now-adult children as a homeschooler. I'm
   doing the same with my grandchildren, since they're exposed to print so
   often in books and other areas.
   I do think that learning cursive is essential so that (at a minimum)
   children grow up able to read their grandparents' and
   great-grandparents' handwriting (and the handwriting of others from
   those generations). When my grandchildren are comfortable writing and
   reading manuscript print, I focus a lot on cursive. I do focus on it
   earlier with the font cards I design to go with each unit. But it isn't
   a thorough, focused emphasis until they're comfortable with manuscript
   letter writing and reading.

F is for Farm Corn Writing Tray (Middle of Middle Shelf in Shelf Photo)

   Free Printables: Farm letters for corn writing tray (part of my
   subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to get the link
   and password … or check the bottom of your latest newsletter if you’re
   already a subscriber)
   For the tray, I used the wooden tray from the Melissa & Doug Lace and
   Trace Shapes. You can use whatever tray or container work best for you,
   though. I just used popping corn for the corn. It doesn't work as well
   for writing as sand or salt, but it's fun and an interesting sensory
   experience. If you would like help with introducing phonetic sounds,
   introducing objects with sounds, or beginning phonics in general, check
   out my DIY Beginning Montessori Phonics with Preschoolers.

Montessori Farm and Barn ar Phonogram Cards

   Farm and Barn ar Phonogram Cards and Booklet
   Free Printables: “ar” farm and barn phonogram cards (part of my
   subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to get the link
   and password … or check the bottom of your latest newsletter if you’re
   already a subscriber)
   Free Printable: Green Series ar Letters from MontessoriSoul (Print two
   sets if you want to use the pictures for movable alphabet word
   building.)
   I love the simplicity of this! It was so easy to prepare, yet it
   isolates the ar phonogram very well. I have a post and video on how to
   introduce words starting with phonograms, even with very young
   children.

Matching Cursive Chicken Alphabet Cards to Manuscript Chicken Alphabet Cards

   Chicken Movable Alphabet or Matching Alphabet Cards in Manuscript and
   Cursive Free Printable: Chicken movable alphabet cards in manuscript
   and cursive (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my
   email to get the link and password … or check the bottom of your latest
   newsletter if you’re already a subscriber)
   My 5½-year-old granddaughter, Zoey, really enjoyed this activity when
   we did it with the apple alphabet cards. I introduced it with a cursive
   tracing board.
   After tracing the letters on the tracing board, Zoey placed the
   manuscript letters in alphabetical order. Then she matched each of the
   cursive letters to the manuscript letters. We'll do a similar activity
   with the chicken alphabet cards.

DIY Holstein Cow and Button Cards and Counters

   DIY Holstein Cow and Black Button Cards and Counters Free Printables:
   Holstein Cow Numbers (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign
   up for my email to get the link and password … or check the bottom of
   your latest newsletter if you’re already a subscriber)
   I love making DIY themed cards and counters to introduce odd and even
   and add interest and variety to cards and counters. I found these micro
   (6mm) buttons that are an inviting way to represent the Holstein cows
   spots. You need exactly 55 buttons if you want to do the numbers and
   counters 1-10. The package contains 100 buttons, so there are even some
   left over. (Note: I used them last year in our fire safety unit for
   Dalmatian cards and counters.)
   DIY Holstein Cow Cards and Counters Layout
   For kids who are already comfortable with symbol and quantity, I’ll
   typically use the cards and counters for hands-on addition,
   subtraction, and other mathematical operations. (See some of my other
   themed posts for ideas.) But sometimes I like to use the odd and even
   labels like I did with the Dalmatian cards and counters.

Farm Number Matching or Addition and Subtraction Game

   Farm Number Matching or Addition and Subtraction Game
   Free Printable: Farm Math from Teacher Mom Plus 3 (I had this printable
   from before, and I just discovered it's no longer available. I'll try
   to find something similar for you.)
   Free Printable: Holstein Cow Numbers (part of my subscriber freebie
   pack, so just sign up for my email to get the link and password … or
   check the bottom of your latest newsletter if you’re already a
   subscriber)
   I often like to use flat glass marbles as markers for many activities
   (although I don't leave them out when I have toddlers around). The way
   I would use this printable for multiple ages is to have younger
   children roll the numbered dice to find a matching number. Then they
   could put a clear flat marble over the number.
   An older child can use the number cards and symbol cards to create an
   addition or subtraction problem to match the number that's rolled with
   the dice.

Farm Bingo

   Farm Animal Bingo Tray
   Free Printable: Farm Animal Bingo Printable from The Preschool Toolbox
   Again, flat glass marbles are fun to use as markers, although I don't
   recommend them when toddlers are around. I just have the printables on
   the tray on my shelves now.
   This printable only has one page plus a page of duplicate images. You
   could use it as a cooperative Bingo game, or just use it for matching.
   I printed out 3 copies of the first page and cut apart the pictures on
   one of the pages. For my toddler grandkids, we'll use the printables
   for picture matching. For Zoey, I've written the words in cursive on
   the backs of the individual cards. She can draw a card, read the name,
   and match it.

Free Farm Printables for Preschoolers-First Graders (some printables for up
to grade 3)

   Montessori-Inspired Farm Pack
   Montessori-Inspired Farm Pack for DIY Cards and Counters, Number or
   Letter Matching, Number or Letter Basket, Bead Bar Work, Hands-on Math
   Operations, Number or Letter Salt/Sand Writing Tray, Letter Tracing,
   DIY Movable Alphabet, and Creative Writing (subscriber freebie, so
   just sign up for my email to get the link and password – or check your
   inbox if you’re already a subscriber).

"Bird Count" Picture Book, With a READ AND DANCE Lesson Plan

   GREETINGS!
   For this blog post, I am introducing a beautiful new picture book by
   Susan Edwards Richmond, with gorgeous illustrations by Stephanie Fizer
   Coleman, and published by Peachtree Publishing Company, Inc.
           This book will be released on October 5, 2019!
   [Bird%252BCount_cover.jpg]
   Here is a
   READ AND DANCE lesson plan to present to young children, to enrich and
   enhance the enjoyment of this book! This lesson is a collaboration
   between Susan and myself; I developed some movement prompts based on
   her book, and she created this full lesson plan around my movement
   ideas, tying it to arts and early literacy standards. She includes
   materials needed, explanation of how to present it, accommodations for
   children with special needs, and an idea for expanding this activity
   into an informal performance for parents and friends.
   You will find this plan, and many more imaginative ideas for preschool
   through fifth grade, on Susan's website. Some of the resources she has
   developed for a unit on birds and bird watching include linking the
   book to technology and math, art and music, social studies and
   geography, Next Generation Science Standards, and so much more!
   Link to Susan Edwards Richmond's website

READ AND DANCE!

   [DSC_0233.jpg]

 Susan Edwards Richmond's Bird Count Activity Plan:

Moving Like a Bird

   Description and Goals
   Children will use movement to retell the story of Bird Count, by
   creating a dance that incorporates their interpretations of different
   birds described in the book. This activity offers children an
   alternative method of storytelling through a kinesthetic learning
   experience.
   Developmental Areas and Skills: Creative and Physical Domains
   Curriculum Standards and Guidelines
   Guidelines for Preschool Learning Experiences (MA Department of
   Education):
   Guiding Preschool Learning in the Arts: Movement and Dance: 6. Act out
   ways that movement
   and dance can show feelings or convey meaning.

          Objectives
         Children will use their bodies to act out the movements of
   birds in the story.
             Children will work cooperatively to create a dance based on
   their creative ideas.
     *
     * Materials
     *
     * Bird Count by Susan Edwards Richmond, illustrated by Stephanie
       Fizer Coleman.

     * Music and a method to play it, such as a CD player.
     *
     *  An open space in the classroom or outdoors.
     *
     * Introduction
     * Read or review Bird Count by Susan Edwards Richmond, illustrated by
       Stephanie Fizer Coleman. Ask children if they can think of other
       ways to tell the story without using words. Tell them that, today,
       they are going to recreate the story using movement, or dance.
     * Procedure
     *
     * 1. Introduce Activity (above)
     *
     * 2. Show children the illustrations of each bird in the story, one
       at a time.

               For each bird, ask: How might this bird move?
          3. Give movement prompts, and incorporate children’s ideas. Here
   are some examples:
     *  Canada goose: Can you fly like a Canada goose? They are very
       strong fliers. Flap your wings as you sail through the sky. Now
       land in Curcurbit Farm’s fields, just like in the story.

       [DSC_0009.jpeg]
       Fly like a Canada goose!
     *
     *  Downy woodpecker: Fly like a woodpecker, and land in a tall tree.
       Use your long beak to peck and find insects.
     *
     *  Duck: Imagine you are swimming like the mallards in the pond, and
       turn upside down with your bottom sticking up! Now dive like a
       merganser.
     *
     * Great blue heron: Stretch your long neck looking for fish. You see
       one! Try to catch it.
     *

   page1image3907950528

                              [DSC_0985.jpg]
                      Turn upside down like a mallard!

     *
     * 4. Once you have explored movement with all of the birds in the
       story, play some lively music and ask the children to dance freely
       about pretending to be all of the birds in the book.
     *
     * 5.  Optional: If children are interested, have them choose which
       birds they’d like to be.Then retell the story, asking each one to
       perform when they are introduced in the text.

   Conclusion
   Wrap up the activity when interest wanes or the activity begins to
   stray. Ask children if they would like to perform their dance for their
   families. If so, tell them you will revisit the activity at a later
   time to practice and prepare. If there is interest, you may wish to add
   an art component by encouraging children to create costumes or sets.
   Accommodations
   This activity provides children with challenges expressing themselves
   verbally an alternative method of expression. Allow children to
   participate using whatever kinds of movement they are comfortable with.
   Children who use a wheelchair can use their arms to imitate birds or
   maneuver the wheelchair in ways that imitate bird movement. Give
   children who may need additional focus a job to do, such as helping to
   display the book pages, or leading particular movements.
   Evaluation
   The activity will be successful if the children engage in movement that
   represents different birds in the story. Other measures of success are
   if the children are able to incorporate some of their own original
   ideas into their movements and if they can cooperate with others in
   performing a class dance!
   Family/Community Engagement
   Present the dance at a community celebration or special event. Or
   record the dance and share it in a weekly newsletter or on a class
   website.
   Keep on dancin',
   Connie

Apple Activities Using Free Printables for a Montessori-Inspired Apple Unit

   By Deb Chitwood from Living Montessori Now
   It's time for a new school year! And it's time to expand my
   already-huge apple unit. So I've added a lot of free apple printables
   and activities along with a free apple pack (subscriber freebie at
   LivingMontessoriNow.com)!
   [Free%2BApple%2BPrintables%2Band%2BActivities%2Bfor%2Ba%2BMontessori-In
   spired%2BApple%2BUnit.jpg]
   You'll find many activities for preschoolers through first graders
   throughout the year along with presentation ideas in my previous posts
   at PreK + K Sharing. You'll also find ideas for using free printables
   to create activity trays here: How to Use Printables to Create
   Montessori-Inspired Activities.
   At Living Montessori Now, I have a post with resource links of Free
   Printables for Montessori Homeschools and Preschools.
   Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links (at no cost to you).

Montessori Shelves with Apple-Themed Activities

   Montessori Shelves with Apple-Themed Activities
   You’ll find Montessori-inspired apple numbers, letters, and and more
   (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to
   get the link and password … or check the bottom of your latest
   newsletter if you’re already a subscriber)
   I always have related books available throughout a unit. On the top
   shelf, I have How Do Apples Grow? by Betsy Maestro and Apples by Gail
   Gibbons. How Do Apples Grow? by Betsy Maestro is Montessori-friendly
   and has fairly in-depth information on the apple life cycle. It's
   recommended for ages 4-8.
   I often have a book by Gail Gibbons as part of our unit. Her apple book
   is another great Montessori-friendly book for 4-8 year olds with a good
   amount of understandable information.
   On the right side of the shelf (book on a wooden cookbook holder), I
   have the awesome I Spy: An Alphabet in Art. It has a wide variety of
   paintings, but I love that the cover photo (the page I have open) is
   the fascinating Son of Man by the surrealist artist René Magritte! The
   book is recommended for ages 4-8, but I love to adapt it for even
   toddlers. I also printed out and included an easel with Paul Cezanne's
   Still Life with Apples.
   You could mix your apple-themed activities among your shelves according
   to curriculum area. Or you could have a special apple-themed area
   something like the one pictured. My shelves this month have a mixture
   of skill levels. Many of the activities can be adapted for a variety of
   levels. If you’re a homeschooler, just choose the activities that work
   for your child’s interests and ability levels. If you don’t have room
   for all the activities you’d like to do, simply rotate them.

Apple Books with Apple Life Cycle Work

   Apple Books with Apple Life Cycle Work
   Free Printables: Apple Life Cycle Printables (subscriber freebie) from
   Welcome to Mommyhood
   I like to introduce the apple life cycle with a book like How Do Apple
   Grow? (see above). The materials were very easy to prepare. I display
   them simply on a Multicraft tray with the added Montessori cards
   display box (which I love and typically use for all my 3-part cards
   now).

Manuscript and Cursive Writing and Spelling Materials

   It's a personal preference if you like to introduce manuscript or
   cursive first. Many Montessorians introduce cursive first, and many
   Montessorians introduce manuscript first. It often depends on what your
   child will be encountering most. When I was a Montessori teacher, my
   students went on to traditional schools, so I always introduced print
   first. I did the same with my now-adult children as a homeschooler. I'm
   doing the same with my grandchildren, since they're exposed to print so
   often in books and other areas.
   I do think that learning cursive is essential so that (at a minimum)
   children grow up able to read their grandparents' and
   great-grandparents' handwriting (and the handwriting of others from
   those generations). When my grandchildren are comfortable writing and
   reading manuscript print, I focus a lot on cursive. I do focus on it
   some earlier with the font cards I design to go with each unit. But it
   isn't a thorough, focused emphasis until they're comfortable with
   manuscript letter writing and reading.

   Free Printables: Apple letters for apple sand writing tray (part of my
   subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to get the link
   and password … or check the bottom of your latest newsletter if you’re
   already a subscriber)
   For the sand tray, I used the wooden tray from the Melissa & Doug Lace
   and Trace Shapes. You can use whatever tray or container work best for
   you, though. I had gotten some lovely white sand for making kinetic
   sand and other projects. I love that it was so easy to make a bright
   color simply by adding gel food coloring and some water. I recommend
   spreading it on a baking pan to dry overnight. If your sand isn’t
   already sterilized, you might want to heat it up at a low temperature
   in your oven to partially dry it.
   If you would like help with introducing phonetic sounds, introducing
   objects with sounds, or beginning phonics in general, check out my DIY
   Beginning Montessori Phonics with Preschoolers.

National Geographic Kids Apples for Everyone Book with Manuscript and Cursive
Movable Alphabet Apple Letters

   Because I'm focusing on cursive as well as manuscript, I made a simple
   tray with the movable alphabet letters for apple in cursive and
   manuscript. (You could use the apple movable alphabet letters from our
   subscriber freebie pack.) I like to use the traditional wooden ones as
   well. We've been using a traditional small wooden manuscript movable
   alphabet, although we're starting to work with the cursive wooden
   movable alphabet. There are a number of price ranges available. You can
   find more movable alphabet resources in my "Inexpensive and DIY Movable
   Alphabets" post.
   I often like to place a book with my materials to draw attention to
   both the book and the activity. I love the photography in National
   Geographic Kids books, including this Apples for Everyone book. While
   there aren't in-depth facts in this book, it's lovely to look at and
   can be used for toddlers through beginning readers.

Matching Cursive Apple Alphabet Cards to Manuscript Apple Alphabet Cards


   Free Printable: Apple movable alphabet cards in manuscript and cursive
   (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to
   get the link and password … or check the bottom of your latest
   newsletter if you’re already a subscriber)
   My 5½-year-old granddaughter, Zoey, really enjoyed this activity. I
   introduced it with a cursive tracing board. I got the 2-sided version
   (with capital letters on one side and lowercase on the other), since
   capital cursive letters aren't commonly seen on written materials.
   After tracing the letters on the tracing board, Zoey placed the
   manuscript letters in alphabetical order. Then she matched each of the
   cursive letters to the manuscript letters.

Parts of an Apple Tree Puzzle and Labels

   Parts of an Apple Tree Puzzle and Labels
   Free Printable: Parts of an Apple Tree (subscriber freebie) from The
   Natural Homeschool
   This was another activity that was super easy to prepare. I simply
   printed out and cut apart the printable (laminate it if you wish) and
   placed it in a Montessori Services basket. See bottom shelf in the
   photo.
   This works well for children who can read, but younger children could
   match the labels to a control puzzle or just put together the puzzle
   without labels.

Montessori Parts of an Apple 3-Part Cards and Booklet-Making Materials

   Montessori Parts of an Apple 3-Part Cards and Booklet-Making Materials
   Free Printables: Parts of the Fruit Nomenclature Cards and Little Book
   from The Helpful Garden
   This is another easy-to-prepare Montessori activity.  I have two of
   these awesome Montessori cards display boxes, so I used the second one
   for this activity. It even worked to place the picture/word cards and
   picture cards in the same section of the display box so that I could
   place the booklet-making pages in the last section.
   I keep my booklet-making supplies in a separate location, so this was a
   perfect way to have activities displayed attractively in a small amount
   of space!

Greater Than, Less Than Apple Activity

   Greater Than, Less Than Apple Tray
   Free Printable: Apple Tree Numbers and Greater Than, Less Than Symbols
   (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to
   get the link and password … or check the bottom of your latest
   newsletter if you’re already a subscriber)
   If you'd like some extra-fun ways to introduce greater than, less than,
   check out my greater than, less than alligator math activities. I
   typically introduce greater than, less than with those and then use an
   activity like this to reinforce the symbols. I used acrylic craft
   apples, but almost any small craft apples will work.
