Candy-Free Easter Egg Stuffers (Toddler Friendly)

   [candy%2Bfree.png]
   My toddlers love to search for eggs...but I hate all the sugar that
   comes along with egg hunting...so I put together a little list of
   candy-free egg stuffers. I was able to fill over 100 eggs with this
   list - and spent under $30. Enjoy!
   1) Stickers - this roll of 100 stickers is $4.55 (with free Prime
   shipping) on Amazon. I love them for my 1-year old because she is
   learning all of her animals...so she will have fun making the animal
   sounds as she opens her eggs on Easter morning.

   2) Squishies - I don't know why...but both my littles are OBSESSED with
   "squishies" - these little sea creatures are adorable and come in their
   own individual packages. I found them on Amazon for $7.99 (with free
   Prime shipping) for a pack of 24. (**Kiddos under 3 will need adult
   supervision with these)
   [IMG_4254.JPG]
   3) Play-Doh - because what little kid is not obsessed with Play-Doh?
   Love these little party favor sized Play-Doh's in an assortment of
   colors - they are $9.95 for a package of 15 on Amazon (with free Prime
   Shipping). Keep in mind that I did need to buy the larger sized eggs
   for the Play-doh...the standard eggs are a too small.
   [IMG_4255.JPG]
   4) Finger Puppets - puppets are so fun for language development and
   imaginative play. I found some cute ones on Amazon (with free shipping)
   for $2.99 for a package of 10.  Ikea also has some adorable ones for
   $4.99 for a package of 10.

   Wishing you {and your little chickadees} a very Happy Easter!

Ditching the binky...

                 [750g+beef+mince1+large+brown+onion2-3.png]
                     Photo Love: Katie Berry Photography

   Let's be honest. I was terrified to take away the binky from my two
   year old. He is completely unreasonable (all toddlers are) and I
   selfishly was concerned it would affect his sleep {in turn, affecting
   MY sleep}. But my pediatrician and dentist had recommended that the
   binky be GONZO by three years...so I knew I had to "grin and bear" it.
   Here is the shocker - it was not as painful as I thought it would be!
   I thought I would share my process with you {note that our son was only
   using his binky for nap/bedtime - but he did sneak it in when sleepy,
   grumpy, etc. on other occasions}:
   1) Buy "Goodbye Binky, The Binky Fairy Story" - I read this to our son
   nightly during our bedtime routine for a week. We talked about how "big
   boys don't need binkies"...and the idea seemed to finally STICK after
   3-4 days. {one comment about this book is that it is geared towards a
   little boy...I am sure that there are plenty of similar books with a
   little girl as the main character if you find that more relatable}.
   {Another great resource is this Sesame Street video "Bye Bye Binky"}
   2) My husband and I would make comments over the course of the week to
   our son, like: "Wow, you are such a big feller - you don't even need a
   binky anymore." "Look at your baby sister - she is a baby and she uses
   a binky." Etc...
   3) Our son is probably the most stubborn child, like ever. So, he never
   fully accepted the idea or leaving his binky for a binky fairy in
   exchange for a present. BUT this process did help to reinforce that BIG
   KIDS don't use binkies and being a BIG KID is cool.
   4) After 5 days, we realized that he was never going to give up his
   binky to a binky fairy after plenty of pleading. So, I did the
   unthinkable. I chopped the tip off his binky with a pair of scissors.
   He hated the chopped up binky and refused to use it. Sort of tough
   love. But after some coaxing and reminders: "You are SO big - you don't
   even need this binky anyways." And a few tears (WAY less than I was
   expecting)..he slept through the night. And did it again...and again.
   Yes, really! You can do this.
   5) After one week of binky-free days - we gave him a special gift (we
   got Braden this awesome roadster) from the Binky Fairy and made a big
   deal of the whole thing. He was pretty stoked.
   6) He is now 9 days sober of the binky - no slip up's yet. :)
   Hope this helps! It worked wonders for us!

Quiet Toddler Activity: Jellybeadz

   [Favorite+Gift.png]
   I am always looking  for new QUIET toddler activities in my house
   {especially with Braden's new baby sister needing lots of attention}.
   And these Jelly Beadz did the trick! They are $7 (with free Amazon
   Prime shipping) and provide some nice, quiet entertainment. Great for
   sensory development + hand-eye coordination. Braden also loved
   practicing colors and numbers while playing too!
   {Disclaimer: you have to soak them in water over-night before you can
   use}
   1) Soak in water.
   [photo-28.JPG]
   2) Add some fun accessories (water bottles, tubes, spoons, bowls, cups,
   etc).
   [photo-24.JPG]
   [photo-25.JPG]
   [photo-27.JPG]
   3) Play!
   [photo-29.JPG]
   **Note that these beads are the size of marbles and ARE NOT recommended
   for little ones that still put things in their mouths! And they
   definitely need to stay separate from curious younger siblings.
   I had initially seen this idea on my sweet friend, Mindy's Munchkin
   Menu, Instagram account. Check out her blog! It has awesome REAL FOOD
   recipes for your tots!
   Enjoy your quiet time!

Toddler Muffin Recipe {great for breast-feeding mommas too}

   [photo-6.JPG]
   It can be SO hard to get my two-year old to eat protein - so I love
   that these muffins are packed with Greek yogurt + eggs....and free of
   refined sugar, wheat and oils. An added bonus is that I LOVE them too!
   And oats are supposed to help with breast-milk production...double
   bonus! They are so easy to make!
   Here is what you need:
   {Makes 1 Dozen Muffins}
     * Blender
     * Aluminum cupcake liners (the muffins stick to paper liners)
     * Cupcake/muffin pan
     * 2 Over-ripe bananas
     * 2 1/2 cups of Old Fashioned oats
     * 1 cup of Greek yogurt
     * 3 eggs
     * Half cup of honey (agave or sugar work too)
     * 1 1/2 Tsp Baking Powder
     * 1/2 Tsp Baking Soda

    1. Pre-heat Oven to 400 degrees
    2. Pour oats into blender - little by little - until the oats looks
       like flour
    3. Add baking soda + baking powder (blend)
    4. Add bananas (blend)
    5. Add Greek yogurt (blend)
    6. Add Honey/sweetener (blend)
    7. Add eggs (blend)
    8. After everything is good and blended - pour into aluminum cupcake
       liners in cupcake/muffin pan
    9. Bake for 22 minutes

   Enjoy! So easy for your toddler to grab for breakfast! And so easy for
   mommas to snack on during middle-of-the night breast feedings.
