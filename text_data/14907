PAHO secures significant price reductions for hepatitis C medicines

   We welcome PAHO's announcement on the new negotiated prices for
   hepatitis C medicines. We call on PAHO & its member states to continue
   pursuing all options to make treatment available.

   Lack of awareness of Chagas disease in the US leading to unnecessary

Lack of awareness of Chagas disease in the US leading to unnecessary deaths
in vulnerable immigrant communities

   A new paper published in PLOS NTDs with the CECD and MSF shows that
   lack of awareness about Chagas disease is among the barriers to
   accessing essential care.

Neglected Patients

   Neglected diseases continue to cause significant morbidity and
   mortality in the developing world. Yet, of the 850 new therapeutic
   products approved between 2000 and 2011, only 4% (and only 1% of all
   approved NCEs) were indicated for neglected diseases, even though these
   diseases account for 11% of the global disease burden.

Sleeping Sickness

   Sleeping sickness is endemic in 36 African countries. 8.5 million
   people are at medium to high risk of being infected.

Leishmaniasis

   1 billion people are at risk of leishmaniasis worldwide. Visceral
   leishmaniasis kills an estimated 20,000-30,000 people annually.

Chagas Disease

   Chagas disease is endemic in 21 Latin American countries where it kills
   more people than malaria. Less than 1% of patients have access to
   treatment.

Paediatric HIV

   1.7 million children below 15 years of age are living with HIV
   globally, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, and 300 of them die every day.

Filarial Disease

   Over 21 million people are infected with onchocerciasis (river
   blindness), and 205 million people are at risk.

Mycetoma

   Stigmatizing disease often resulting in devastating deformities,
   amputation, and morbidity. Treatment success for eumycetoma is less
   than 35%.

Hepatitis C

   71 million people worldwide chronically infected in 2015, of which 75%
   live in low- and middle-income countries.

Mechanisms of experimental resistance of leishmania to miltefosine:
Implications for clinical use

   by Perez-Victoria FJ, Sanchez-Canete MP, Seifert K, Croft SL, Sundar S,
   Castanys S, Gamarro F. Drug Resist Updates, Feb-Apr 2006, 9(1-2):26-39.
   Review.

   Summary: Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, MIL), registered as
   Impavido®, has become the first oral drug for the treatment of visceral
   and cutaneous leishmanasis. MIL is a simple molecule, very stable,
   relatively safe and highly efficient in clinical trials. However, MIL
   requires a long treatment course (28 days) and has a long half-life
   (around 150 h), which might accelerate the emergence of drug resistance
   in case of inadequate use.
