   I finished the Intermediate Herbal Course yesterday, so I look forward
   to diving into the Entrepreneur Herbal Course next. I truly am so
   impressed with the course. Since starting, I’ve been waking up at 5
   a.m. every morning to study for a few hours before work. Those
   early-morning times with my materia medica open, the fire burning, and
   my dogs curled up on either side of my lap have brought so much joy.
   Thank you for helping to provide that!
