Video Branding with FlexClip

   [video-branding-with-flexclip.jpg]
   The growing number of businesses, products and services is unstop-able.
   How you market your business today is different than the old-school
   advertising. The challenge is how to personalize your business with
   strong branding presentation. How to get your potential customers and
   the loyal ones to engage more with your product with more entertaining
   visual media. We are familiar enough with graphic media which is rather
   static and presenting lesser of story to your product or service in one
   package. But how about video branding?
   How can a brand spread its message on diverse platforms and talk to
   different audiences through unique content, while also clearly
   capturing the brand‚Äôs voice, look and feel? There's an interesting
   article written by Stanley Meytin for Forbes that explained how video
   brand identity can work as a blueprint for effective marketing.
   There are many reasons why you should use video branding. Obviously,
   selling is about storytelling, and videos are a great way to share a
   story of your product or service. Video helps people get to know, like
   and trust you. Videos will always keep your audience interested and
   feel convenient, no matter your product or service.
   But what if you don't know how to create a video? For that, there's a
   great web tool that you can try, and it's called FlexClip. FlexClip is
   a simple yet powerful video maker that creates marketing videos and
   family stories in minutes. Make a great video will not take too long in
   a simple interface, much simpler than any other video editor software
   :D.
   First of all, you can create a project then pick one of many collection
   of video templates that will fit what you need. Add videos or photos
   from computer or stock libraries to the storyboard. FlexClip has
   extensive media library where you can search great numbers of
   high-resolution photos, and royalty-free videos and audios to create a
   highly original video. You can also upload your own music file and
   voiceover.
   [Extensive%2BMedia%2BLibrary.png]
   Then customize your storyboard by adding text template with various
   style options of animation provided in the editor. Basic and Plus
   subscription can add watermark in each storyboard.
   [A%2BHandy%2BVideo%2BEditor.png]
   What I love about FlexClip is that you can apply the same color scheme
   for texts or design elements to all of your storyboard to consistently
   fit to your logo or brand identity.
   [Dynamic%2BText%2BAnimations.png]
   Preview your video and if you're happy with how it goes, you can
   download the video (in .mp4 file format) in different Video Quality.
   Free plan can download the 480p quality, 720p for Basic and 1080p for
   Plus subscriptions.
   As a video editor, FlexClip is equipped with quick video cutter &
   trimmer, and simple audio editor. The limit is your creativity as you
   can produce a movie for business, festivals, special events, and social
   media platforms with great efficiency. It can also work as a slideshow
   maker. Fantastic produced slideshow by FlexClip will make easier to
   grab the attention of your audience, making teaching more active and
   effective. More importantly, it can help to promote your business, to
   grow brand awareness or advertise your products to boost sales.

How Do You Subscribe to Blogs?

   [How-do-you-subscribe-to-blo.jpg]
   These days online content is widely accessible for us in the form of
   infography, forum website, Facebook story, Tweets, blogs and many more
   as the gadget technology innovation becomes diverse and growing in
   types. Reading is easier to do while travelling as you can access
   online content anytime with your phone. But today we will focus more on
   Blogs. In an article which is written by WP Beginner, it explained the
   different between a blog and a website:

     A blog is a type of website where the content is presented in
     reverse chronological order (newer content appear first). Blog
     content is often referred to as entries or ‚Äúblog posts‚Äù.

   So it is understood that blogs will likely have regular updates and
   informative in nature. People with different interests will chose to
   read blog topic that would fit their interest or preferences. Why
   people read blogs? to answer that question, Neil Patel wrote a great
   post article about 'Why People Read Content Online'. You may want to
   subscribe to a blog because you need to follow new information or
   keeping yourself updated with news. You also want to improve your skill
   or following tutorials which have been posted regularly by your
   favorite blog. You may just read a blog, because reading simply will
   make you feel good :D
   From this point, I assume that some of you read or follow several blogs
   from time to time. You either subscribe to a blog by RSS Feed,
   subscribe by email or just bookmark a blog URL to read its latest posts
   later on. Our weekend poll will have a question: "How Do You Subscribe
   to Blogs?".
   Each option of subscription will have have advantage and weakness which
   is depending on your reading style and need. I'd like to know your
   reasons of what you will vote. You probably want to share your favorite
   feed reader platform too, so feel free to leave comment either on the
   Twitter poll post or just comment here! :)
    Happy weekend everyone!

   Hiring an expert can be a better solution if you want a more
   profesional look for your logo design.
   But if yo have no experience to work with a logo designer, you can read
   this interesting article from Penji that shares tips of hiring a
   profesional to get your logo perfectly done for your business, hence
   you would have more idea about it and what to consider before you hire
   someone.
   Getting your instant logo from Brand Marketplace

   and business name for your company. So Branding actually has several
   components and a few of them are the logo design plus the unique and
   memorable company name. Brand Marketplace will provide you many
   alternatives of brand stocks to choose with. But first you'd probably
   need to understand how to pick a great brand name that will stick to
   your customers mind and this article from Rebrandly will help you to
   name your Brand.
   You can also check some of Brand Marketplaces such as: BrandCrowd,

Video Branding with FlexClip

   [video-branding-with-flexclip.jpg]
   The growing number of businesses, products and services is unstop-able.
   How you market your business today is different than the old-school
   advertising. The challenge is how to personalize your business with
   strong branding presentation. How to get your potential customers and
   the loyal ones to engage more with your product with more entertaining
   visual media. We are familiar enough with graphic media which is rather
   static and presenting lesser of story to your product or service in one
   package. But how about video branding?
   How can a brand spread its message on diverse platforms and talk to
   different audiences through unique content, while also clearly
   capturing the brand‚Äôs voice, look and feel? There's an interesting
   article written by Stanley Meytin for Forbes that explained how video
   brand identity can work as a blueprint for effective marketing.
   There are many reasons why you should use video branding. Obviously,
   selling is about storytelling, and videos are a great way to share a
   story of your product or service. Video helps people get to know, like
   and trust you. Videos will always keep your audience interested and
   feel convenient, no matter your product or service.
   But what if you don't know how to create a video? For that, there's a
   great web tool that you can try, and it's called FlexClip. FlexClip is
   a simple yet powerful video maker that creates marketing videos and
   family stories in minutes. Make a great video will not take too long in
   a simple interface, much simpler than any other video editor software
   :D.
   First of all, you can create a project then pick one of many collection
   of video templates that will fit what you need. Add videos or photos
   from computer or stock libraries to the storyboard. FlexClip has
   extensive media library where you can search great numbers of
   high-resolution photos, and royalty-free videos and audios to create a
   highly original video. You can also upload your own music file and
   voiceover.
   [Extensive%2BMedia%2BLibrary.png]
   Then customize your storyboard by adding text template with various
   style options of animation provided in the editor. Basic and Plus
   subscription can add watermark in each storyboard.
   [A%2BHandy%2BVideo%2BEditor.png]
   What I love about FlexClip is that you can apply the same color scheme
   for texts or design elements to all of your storyboard to consistently
   fit to your logo or brand identity.
   [Dynamic%2BText%2BAnimations.png]
   Preview your video and if you're happy with how it goes, you can
   download the video (in .mp4 file format) in different Video Quality.

   Plus subscriptions.
   As a video editor, FlexClip is equipped with quick video cutter &
   trimmer, and simple audio editor. The limit is your creativity as you

How Do You Subscribe to Blogs?

   [How-do-you-subscribe-to-blo.jpg]
   These days online content is widely accessible for us in the form of
   infography, forum website, Facebook story, Tweets, blogs and many more
   as the gadget technology innovation becomes diverse and growing in
   types. Reading is easier to do while travelling as you can access
   online content anytime with your phone. But today we will focus more on
   Blogs. In an article which is written by WP Beginner, it explained the
   different between a blog and a website:

     A blog is a type of website where the content is presented in
     reverse chronological order (newer content appear first). Blog
     content is often referred to as entries or ‚Äúblog posts‚Äù.

   So it is understood that blogs will likely have regular updates and
   informative in nature. People with different interests will chose to
   read blog topic that would fit their interest or preferences. Why
   people read blogs? to answer that question, Neil Patel wrote a great
   post article about 'Why People Read Content Online'. You may want to
   subscribe to a blog because you need to follow new information or
   keeping yourself updated with news. You also want to improve your skill
   or following tutorials which have been posted regularly by your
   favorite blog. You may just read a blog, because reading simply will
   make you feel good :D
   From this point, I assume that some of you read or follow several blogs
   from time to time. You either subscribe to a blog by RSS Feed,
   subscribe by email or just bookmark a blog URL to read its latest posts
   later on. Our weekend poll will have a question: "How Do You Subscribe
   to Blogs?".
   Each option of subscription will have have advantage and weakness which
   is depending on your reading style and need. I'd like to know your
   reasons of what you will vote. You probably want to share your favorite
   feed reader platform too, so feel free to leave comment either on the
   Twitter poll post or just comment here! :)
    Happy weekend everyone!

   costumers would prefer to buy products or services from a familiar
   brand.

   already there for long time with their devoted costumers?
   You need to find ways to differentiate‚Äìwith a solid brand building
   process of your own. This good article by FreshSparks. will give you

   Another following question will be: Who is the right person or team to
   develop or build your brand identity idea or concept?
   This question will be related with the level of your business. When you
   start a new small business, with limited budget you have to be creative

   that fits your product or service from online resources such as
   CreativeMarket Blog tutorial to design a logo or to study to understand
   the aspects needed to create brand identity from Format magazine.
   Hire a logo or Brand Identity designer
   Hiring an expert can be a better solution if you want a more
   profesional look for your logo design.
   But if yo have no experience to work with a logo designer, you can read
   this interesting article from Penji that shares tips of hiring a
   profesional to get your logo perfectly done for your business, hence
   you would have more idea about it and what to consider before you hire
   someone.
   Getting your instant logo from Brand Marketplace
   This option could be effective if you want many alternative of logos
   and business name for your company. So Branding actually has several
   components and a few of them are the logo design plus the unique and
   memorable company name. Brand Marketplace will provide you many
   alternatives of brand stocks to choose with. But first you'd probably
   need to understand how to pick a great brand name that will stick to
   your customers mind and this article from Rebrandly will help you to
   name your Brand.
   You can also check some of Brand Marketplaces such as: BrandCrowd,
