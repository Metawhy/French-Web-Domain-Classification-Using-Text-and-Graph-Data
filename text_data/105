A key stakeholder in sustainable development science

   The French National Research Institute for Development (IRD) is an
   internationally recognised multidisciplinary organisation working
   primarily in partnership with Mediterranean and intertropical
   countries.
   Bloc de texte

Our identity

   The IRD is a French public establishment operating under the joint
   authority of the French Ministry for Higher Education, Research and
   Innovation and the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs. Via
   its network and presence in fifty or so countries, it takes an original
   approach to research, expertise, training, and knowledge-sharing to the
   benefit of countries and regions that make science and innovation key
   drivers in their development.
     * A rich community of more than 7,000 people including 2,050 IRD
       agents (851 researchers and 1,199 IRD engineers and technicians)?
     * 29% of agents working outside mainland France
     * 72 research units
     * 1,429 articles published in 2017 by IRD researchers in the Web of
       Science
     * 62% of co-publications with a partner in the South

   Bloc de texte

Science committed to a sustainable future

   Scientific progress is necessary to further sustainable and human
   development: the IRD carries this conviction with it wherever it is
   present and wherever it works with its partners.

   The IRD is a key French player on the international development agenda.
   It works based on an original model: equitable scientific partnership
   with developing countries, primarily those in the intertropical regions
   and the Mediterranean area.

   Only this model allows us to design solutions which are adapted to the
   challenges that humans and the planet are facing (such as pandemics,
   climate change, humanitarian and political crises, and more) because
   the whole planet is facing these development challenges.
   Exergue

   Seul ce modèle permet de concevoir des solutions adaptées aux défis
   auxquels les hommes et la planète font face : pandémies, dérèglements
   climatiques, crises humanitaires et politiques…Car les défis du
   développement se posent à la planète toute entière.
   Bloc de texte

   The IRD priorities are part of efforts to implement the Sustainable
   development goals (SDGs) adopted in September 2015 by the United
   Nations and to perform critical analyses. The aim of the SDGs is to
   orient development policies and tackle the challenges related to
   overarching environment, economic, social, and cultural changes that
   affect the whole planet.

Working together on science that supports development

   As a multidisciplinary institute, the IRD demonstrates the importance
   of its unique approach by conducting research appropriate for
   addressing major development challenges.
   Bloc de texte

   At the forefront of sustainability science, IRD research springs from
   real-world problems faced by societies and ecosystems rather than the
   dynamics of the scientific disciplines that it mobilises?.

   Since this research concentrates on the intertropical and Mediterranean
   regions where the greatest ecological, social, and political
   vulnerabilities are combined for current models of development, it
   often almost naturally ends up at the front lines of major debates. For
   this reason, the IRD favours interdisciplinary and intersectional
   scientific approaches to the SDGs^?Sustainable Development Goals.

   Our structuring interdisciplinary partnership programmes (PSIPs)
   Bloc de texte

The pillars of our action for development

     * An equitable scientific partnership and co-publications with
       partners in developing countries
     * Solutions which are adapted to global challenges and based on
       scientific evidence
     * Public policies informed by scientific advances
     * Citizens driving change
     * Responsible innovations
     * Specific expertise and know-how

   Bloc de texte

Using a multidisciplinary and partner-based approach to research to tackle
major development challenges

   With the help of its partners, the IRD produces excellent, rigorous
   science meeting international standards that can be used to take
   decisions and shape public policy. World health, governance,
   inequalities & poverty, mobility & migration, climate change and other
   global changes, oceans, natural risks, sustainable agriculture,
   biodiversity, ecosystems, and resources are just a few of the themes
   examined through a multidisciplinary approach. The scientific activity
   of the IRD is rolled out through its research units and measures in
   France and abroad.

Embodying an innovative, comprehensive, & strategic vision of development
research

   The IRD contributes to the emergence, strengthening and empowerment of
   scientific communities and higher education and research systems in
   partner countries through its research.

   The IRD collaborates with all public and private actors, whether
   European or international, working on sustainable development
   challenges. Its research is consistent with the ideals of science and
   open & responsible innovation to change lifestyles.

The IRD around the world

   The IRD relies on its network of representatives abroad to organise its
   collaborations.
   Bloc de texte

   We are able to work together with our partners in France and in
   developing countries, bridging barriers between different disciplines
   and between fundamental and applied sciences; this liminal space is
   where new ideas develop.
   Bloc de texte

Our geographical priorities

   The IRD is present in: France; the French overseas departments and
   territories; international and European organisations in Brussels &
   Rome; and above all, in intertropical regions and the Mediterranean.
   Their situation requires a renewed pillar of knowledge to bring
   together the reduction of development inequalities, global changes,
   achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and innovation based on
   research.

   The IRD's cooperation methods are flexible and responsive, ranging from
   support for interdisciplinary research centres put in place by the
   partner countries to participation in joint scientific projects and
   programmes.

   Thanks to its network of representatives, the IRD can put scientific
   cooperation with developing countries at the heart of the national and
   European research and development assistance strategy. The IRD is
   present both in its immediate management of environmental, health or
   geostrategic crises and in crisis prevention and preparation measures
   which require significant interdisciplinary expertise.
