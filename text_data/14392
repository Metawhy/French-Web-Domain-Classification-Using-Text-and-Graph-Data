   LACMA is open during construction.

   We’re preparing for the construction of our new building for the
   permanent collection—the David Geffen Galleries. Opening in 2024, the
   building will breathe new life into thousands of years of art history.

   Learn more about LACMA’s transformation and construction timeline.

   While the original permanent collection galleries are closed, art from
   the museum’s collection will continue to be on view in exhibitions in
   BCAM and the Resnick Pavilion. Urban Light and Levitated Mass will
   continue to be open to visitors.

   Learn more about what’s on view and what to expect on campus.
