Trimage image compressor – 1.0.6

   A cross-platform tool for losslessly optimizing PNG and JPG files for
   web.

   Trimage is a cross-platform GUI and command-line interface to optimize
   image files for websites, using optipng, pngcrush, advpng and
   jpegoptim, depending on the filetype (currently, PNG and JPG files are
   supported). It was inspired by imageoptim. All image files are
   losslessy compressed on the highest available compression levels, and
   EXIF and other metadata is removed. Trimage gives you various input
   functions to fit your own workflow: A regular file dialog, dragging and
   dropping and various command line options.
