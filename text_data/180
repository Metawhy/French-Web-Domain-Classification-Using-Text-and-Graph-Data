HACK IN PARIS 2020

   Intrusion attempts are more and more frequent and sophisticated,
   regardless of their target (state or corporation). In this context,
   international hacking events are multiplying. A few events took place
   in France but until now, no one had covered hacking practices with a
   technical approach including both professional training and information
   aspects.

   Hack In Paris aims at filling this gap. After the success of the latest
   edition with more than 750 attendees, this 5-day corporate event will
   be held for the tenth time in France, at the Maison de la Chimie. Hack
   In Paris attendees (IT security passionate and professionals) will
   gather around a very rich and diverse program : state of the art IT
   security, industrial espionage, penetration testing, physical security,
   forensics, malware analysis techniques and countermeasures.

   Organized by Sysdream, the Cybersecurity Division of the Hub One group,
   Hack In Paris will be held from June 15th to 19th 2020 in English :

   Trainings
          June 15th to 17th, three days of trainings given by security
          officers (CISOs, CIOs) and technical experts.

   Talks, workshops
          June 18th & 19th, two days of talk and workshops given by
          international speakers and technical experts. During these 2
          days, a lot of activities as Wargame, Jeopardy, Live Hacking
          Event, had been added in order to widen the program of the
          event.
