Cadbury® Jelly Eggs

   [DSC_4235.jpg]
   [DSC_4238.jpg]
   Happy Easter to My Lovely Fluffy Peeps.
   Time for a nearly overdue Easter greeting from me, jelly-style. (I've
   been laid up with the flu this week, and haven't been able to post.
   Boo. Flu. UGH.)
   Cadbury Eggs have been something of an obsession for me, ever since
   their sugar-y, chocolate-y, syrupy, silky perfection hit the likely
   pre-diabetic bloodstream of my fat little prepubescent self oh so many
   years ago. Cadbury Eggs remain ever-present in my thoughts this time of
   year, so it was natural, what with JSTK relauching, to make the
   slightly blasphemous jelly leap to this most favorite, dreamed about,
   lusted after candy. Truly, I thought, why couldn't we make a jellied
   Cadbury Egg? Why can't we put cream inside a jelly shot? WHY WHY WHY.
   Before we launch into the recipe, I must clarify, for the edification
   of the nice Cadbury folks, that Cadbury is a registered trademark of
   Mondelēz International. JSTK is not affiliated in any way with Cadbury,
   Mondelēz or their related entities. JSTK has not received any
   promotional incentives in creating this recipe, but rather, the nice
   Cadbury folks are likely more horrified than delighted by the
   jellification of their lovely Cadbury eggs. But, mah peeps, thaz how we
   roll here at JSTK. Bold. Chocolate-y. Rebelz.
   Happy Easter!
   XO M.
   P.S. I tried to do a full step-by-step on this, but due to high fever,
   all the pre-assembly photos are blurry, and completely unusable. The
   assembly photos themselves are marginal, but hopefully helpful!
   P.P.S. Here's the link to the Wilton Brownie Pop Mold used for the
   eggs.
   Cadbury® Jelly Eggs
   Jelly Shot Mixture
     * 1 1/4 cup water
     * 3 tbsp sweetened condensed milk
     * 3 envelopes plain gelatin (we use Knox brand, it’s a little over 6
       tsp gelatin powder total)
     * 1 cup Godiva Milk Chocolate liqueur
     * 1/2 cup espresso, marshmallow or vanilla flavored vodka
     * 2 tbsp Kahlua coffee liqueur (optional)

   Whipped Filling
     * 1 cup heavy whipping cream
     * 1 tbsp instant pudding mix (vanilla, cheesecake, white chocolate,
       etc.)
     * Vanilla extract and sugar to flavor, if desired
     * Yellow food coloring

   Equipment
     * 2 silicone brownie pop molds or 2 standard non-reactive loaf pans
       (about 8" x 4")
     * hand mixer
     * mini scoop, or small teaspoons

   Place a glass or metal bowl in the freezer, to get nice and cold for
   use in whipping cream.
   Prepare molds by spraying lightly with cooking spray, then wiping clean
   with a paper towel. This will leave a very thin layer of lubrication
   which will ease unmolding without affecting the taste or appearance of
   your jelly shots. These molds are a little tricky, and the filled
   jellies are a little delicate, so this prep is very important– be
   thorough and consistent. (If you're using a pan, this step is
   optional.)
   Pour water and sweetened condensed milk into a saucepan. Sprinkle with
   gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two. Heat over low heat,
   stirring constantly, until gelatin is fully dissolved (about 5
   minutes).
   Remove from heat. Stir in the liquors.
   Place the prepared molds on a sturdy pan for support. Fill each mold
   about 1/4 of the way full (a little less than a tablespoon of jelly
   shot mixture). Place pan in refrigerator. Wrap the remaining jelly
   mixture and set aside on counter to keep warm.
   Remove bowl from freezer. Pour cream and 1 tbsp pudding mix into the
   chilled bowl, whip on high until stiff peaks form. Add vanilla extract
   and sugar to taste, if desired.
   Take about 1/3 of the whipped cream and mix in several drops of yellow
   food coloring to make the egg “yolk.” With the scoop, make 16 little
   tiny scoops, about 1/2 teaspoon volume.
   Remove the partially filled molds from the refrigerator. Test the jelly
   mixture – it should be set, but just a bit sticky. Place one “yolk” in
   the middle of each cavity, followed by a larger scoop of white whip
   mixture. Make sure to keep the whip in the middle, and not touch the
   sides.  Pour one tablespoon of the reserved jelly mixture into each
   cavity. This, when set, will anchor the whip, so it doesn’t float to
   the top.  Return the molds to the refrigerator for a couple minutes,
   until the added jelly mixture is set, but still a little sticky, 10 to
   15 minutes. Then, fill each cavity to the top.
   Refrigerate until fully set, 3 to 4 hours.  If setting longer than
   that, tent a little foil over the molds, so the top doesn’t dry out too
   much and tear the jelly shots when you remove them from the molds.
   To serve, unmold (or cut into cube if you're using a pan). To unmold,
   loosen the edges by pulling away from the side of the mold, and just
   pop each jelly shot out.
   Yield: about 16 jelly shots (volume about 3 tbsp each)

Irish Car Bomb Jelly Shots

   [DSC_4144_640px.jpg]
   Its official! No green, no sprinkles. St. Patrick's Day is going ever
   so slightly GLAM at Jelly Shot Test Kitchen this year.
   We like these Irish Car Bomb Jelly Shots made as separate components –
   it seems truer to the original drop-in-a-shot style cocktail – however
   the recipe could be made as a layered jelly shot in a 1 lb loaf pan.
   But seriously, yawn. We are so beyond bored with layered jelly shots …
   so 2009.
   The round molds are nice, but not necessarily needed. The components
   could be set in separate pans, and sliced into crisp squares, or cut
   out with small cookie cutters.  We used a 1 tbsp volume half-round mold
   for the Guinness layer, and a 1 tsp half-round mold for the Bailys
   layer. The Whiskey layer was set in a small pan, and then sliced.
   As a finishing touch, we brushed the Whiskey layer with edible gold
   flakes – available in oodles of kitchen and cake decorating stores. Dab
   or brush on with a paintbrush. You just need the tiniest little bit on
   each.
   Cheers! XO, Michelle
   P.S. I'll add a step-by-step soon. But this post is outrageously late
   for St. Patrick's Day as it is ....
   Irish Car Bomb Jelly Shots
   Fist, prepare your setting vessels (silicon molds or pans) by spraying
   with cooking spray and wiping clean with a paper towel. This will leave
   a very slight residue, which will assist in unmolding your jelly shots
   without affecting their taste or texture.
   Guinness Layer
     * 1 1/4 cup Guinness beer
     * 3 tsp Knox Gelatin (each envelope is about 2 1/4 tsp of gelatin
       powder)
     * 1/4 cup Kahlua coffee liqueur

   Pour the Guinness into a saucepan, and sprinkle with gelatin. Allow the
   mixture to set for a minute or two, to allow the gelatin to soften.
   Turn burner on low. Heat without stirring for a few minutes (this helps
   the carbonation dissipate), then stir until gelatin is fully dissolved.
   Stir in the Kahlua. Pour into a 1 lb non-reactive loaf pan or molds,
   and refrigerate until firm.
   Baileys Layer
     * 1/2 cup water
     * 2 tsp Knox gelatin
     * 1/2 cup Bailys Irish Cream liqueur

   Pour the water into a small saucepan, and sprinkle with gelatin. Cook
   on low heat for a few minutes, stirring constantly until the gelatin is
   fully dissolved. Stir in the Bailys. Pour into a small non-reactive pan
   or molds, and refrigerate until firm.
   Irish Whiskey Layer
     * 1/2 cup water
     * 1 tsp Knox gelatin
     * 1/2 cup Irish Whiskey

   Pour the water into a small saucepan, and sprinkle with gelatin. Cook
   on low heat for a few minutes, stirring constantly until the gelatin is
   fully dissolved. Stir in the whiskey. Pour into a small non-reactive
   pan, and refrigerate until firm.
   Note: some whiskey jellies get cloudy if set in a metal pan. This
   doesn't affect the taste, just the appearance. Use a glass or ceramic
   pan to keep it clear.
   To serve, unmold or slice into squares. Brush the whiskey gelatin with
   edible gold flakes before serving, if feeling fancy. Makes
   approximately 24 jelly shots.

Blue Hawaii Jelly Shots

   [blue-hawaii.jpg]
   Oh, yes, jelly people, following is another blast from JSTK's
   press-rich archives. Blue Hawaii Jelly Shots - sweet, tropical,
   rum-soaked and BLUE.  Oh YEZ. The recipe appeared on Serious Eats in
   2011, as promo press for the self-titled cocktail inspired jelly shot
   tome that rocked the culinary and pop culture spheres: Jelly Shot Test
   Kitchen - Jelling Classic Cocktails One Drink at a Time. (And by rocked
   I mean that a few people noticed it, wrote about it, and bought a few
   copies. This is also my cue to shout out a hale and hearty "hell yeah,
   bitchez!") And now recipe is here on the blog for your recipe perusing
   convenience.  I will continue rounding these press babies up as I
   discover them again and posting them to the blog.  Forgive my earlier
   raucous outburst. I have had a martini this evening, and no good can
   come of it.
   XO Michelle
   Blue Hawaii Jelly Shots
   Ingredients
   Blue Layer
     * 1⁄4 cup canned pineapple juice, strained to remove solids
     * 1⁄4 cup vodka
     * 1 envelope Knox gelatin
     * 1⁄4 cup blue curaçao liqueur
     * 1⁄4 cup white rum

   Yellow Layer
     * 3⁄4 cup pineapple juice, strained to remove solids
     * 1⁄4 cup Lemon Syrup (recipe follows)
     * 1 envelope Knox gelatin

   Lemon Syrup (FYI this makes a freaking ton of syrup - way more than
   needed for recipe)
     * 1 ½ cups water
     * 1 cup granulated sugar
     * 4 medium lemons, each cut into 8 wedges

   Instructions:
   Note:A 50-50 mix of frozen lemonade concentrate and water may be
   substituted for Lemon Syrup. In this case it would be 2 tbsp of
   concentrate, 2 tbsp water. Strain to remove any lemon pulp!
   For the Blue Layer: Combine the pineapple juice and vodka in a small
   saucepan and sprinkle with the gelatin. Allow the gelatin to soak for a
   minute or two. Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin
   is fully dissolved, about 5 minutes. (Take care to use very low heat,
   to avoid overheating the alcohol.) Remove from the heat and stir in the
   curaçao and rum. Transfer mixture to loaf pan or molds and refrigerate
   for at least an hour or until fully set.
   For the Lemon Syrup: Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan.
   Muddle the lemon wedges. Bring to a rolling boil over medium heat.
   Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and
   strain immediately. Allow the syrup to cool to room temperature.
   For the Yellow Layer: Combine the pineapple juice and 1/4 cup lemon
   syrup in a small saucepan and sprinkle with the gelatin. Allow the
   gelatin to soak for a minute or two. Heat over very low heat, stirring
   constantly, until gelatin is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from
   the heat and allow to cool slightly. Remove set Blue Layer from
   refrigerator, and ladle the yellow gelatin mixture over the top.
   Refrigerate until fully set, several hours or overnight.
   To serve, cut into desired shapes or unmold shots.

Pimms Cup Jelly Shots

   [pimms_jstkweb.jpg]
   OMG! It's our old friend, Pimms Cup (No. 1). Some of you may be
   experiencing some de ja vu as this recipe appears in the Jelly Shot
   Test Kitchen recipe book of classic cocktail inspired delights.
   HOWEVER, it was also published on Serious Eats and bon appetite sites
   back in 2011! (Ah, 2011. Book releases. Press. Good Times.) As such, we
   can share the recipe here with you on the blog as well, for ease of
   recipe reference.
   But back to the recipe. Pimms Cup Jelly Shots is one of our all time
   favorites. We smile just thinking about it, let alone making a batch.
   So cute, so fun with its sweet little fruit bouquet -  a tiny bite of
   summer!
   Cheers and XO!
   Michelle
   Pimms Cup (No. 1) Jelly Shots
   Pan and Accoutrements: 1-pound loaf pan (approximately 8” x 4”), large
   cocktail shaker and cocktail muddler
   Ingredients
     * 4 strawberries
     * 1 orange slice (about 1 inch), coarsely chopped
     * 2 large sprigs fresh mint
     * 1 (1-inch) piece cucumber, coarsely chopped
     * 3/4 cup Pimm’s No. 1 Cup
     * 6 ice cubes
     * 2/3 cup ginger ale
     * 2/3 cup lemon syrup (recipe follows)
     * 2 envelopes Knox gelatin
     * Slivers of cucumber, strawberry, orange, and mint for garnish if
       desired

   Lemon Syrup:
     * 1 ½ cups water
     * 1 cup granulated sugar
     * 4 medium lemons, each cut into 8 wedges

   Make the Lemon Syrup: Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan.
   Muddle the lemon wedges. Bring to a rolling boil over medium heat.
   Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and
   strain immediately. Allow the syrup to cool to room temperature.
   Short cut: A 50-50 mix of frozen lemonade concentrate and water may be
   substituted for Lemon Syrup. Make sure to strain to remove any lemon
   pulp!
   Muddle fruit together the strawberries, orange, mint, and chopped
   cucumber in a large cocktail shaker. Add Pimm’s and the ice cubes and
   shake vigorously. Strain liquid through fine mesh strainer and set
   aside (you should have approximately 2/3 cup of liquid).
   Combine ginger ale and lemon syrup in saucepan in a medium saucepan and
   sprinkle with gelatin. Allow gelatin to soak for a minute or two. Heat
   over very low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin is fully
   dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add the reserved
   Pimm’s liquid, stirring well to blend. Pour into pan and chill until
   fully set, several hours or overnight.
   To serve, cut into rectangles. Add spectacular garnish. First, peel
   “ribbons” from cucumber using a vegetable peeler. The ribbons should be
   about 6 inches long for easy handling. Group the slivered fruit and
   mint as desired, and tie each bundle with a cucumber ribbon. Trim the
   ribbon ends to desired length. Place a fruit bundle on each jelly shot.

Raspberry Marshmallow-tini Jelly Shots

   [DSC_3975_new.jpg]
   I mentioned to a dear friend that I was working on a new jelly shot for
   Valentines Day. She indicated that she would rather eat glass than be
   subjected to another syrupy pink sentiment of a disingenuous holiday,
   from JSTK or otherwise. Or words to that effect (your dear M. has
   scrubbed them up a touch for publication on the interwebs).
   So, the Raspberry Marshmallow-tini Jelly Shot, with its mended-heart
   motif is dedicated to those who may be hosting Anti-Valentines Day
   celebrations, or perhaps are just feeling a little shat upon in the
   romance department. It's cute, without being cloying - and tasty to
   boot.
   We were after a sweet-tart effect, and as such chose Hangar One
   Raspberry vodka for the clear gelatin portion. This is just a beautiful
   vodka - tart, and flecked with little bits of berry. Hangar One makes
   one batch a year each June, when the berries are ripe. What better
   story is there than that? Genius. If you can find it, buy it.
   Otherwise, there are many other lovely raspberry vodkas out there. You
   may even have one in your cupboard already.
   Regarding color, there are but a few times a year when we like to use
   food coloring at JSTK, and Valentines is one of them. We used
   McCormick's Neon shades, in pink for both layers.
   If you don't feel like an art project, this jelly shot can be made in
   two layers, in two 1 lb loaf pans. Just chill the raspberry layer in
   the fridge until mostly set, but slightly sticky when touched, then add
   the slightly cooled marshmallow layer, and refrigerate for several
   hours or overnight and slice up for serving. You know the drill by now,
   dears ...
   Full recipe and step-by-steps follow.
   Happy Valentines Day and a big smooshy kiss from your Valentine,
   Michelle
   [DSC_3805.jpg]
    Pan: Heart-shaped silicon mold (we used a 24-cavity Wilton silicon
   mold)
   [DSC_3806.jpg]
   Prepare your mold by spraying lightly with cooking spray, and then
   wiping each cavity clean. The idea is to leave only the slightest
   residue of spray to assist in unmolding your jelly shots.  Place the
   mold on a sturdy, portable flat surface, such as a cookie sheet or
   cutting board.
   [DSC_3776.jpg]
   Next, prepare the raspberry layer.  Pour the soda into a saucepan.
   Sprinkle with gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two. Heat over
   low heat, stirring occasionally, until gelatin is fully dissolved (just
   a few minutes).
   [DSC_3819.jpg]
   Stir in the sweet and sour mix (or lemonade) and vodka.
   [DSC_3821.jpg]
   Assess your need for food coloring, and if needed stir in a few drops
   of the pink or red food coloring. (Some vodka brands already have
   coloring in them and your mixture will not need any more – ours did -
   we used 3 drops of pink.)
   [DSC_3823.jpg]
   Fill the mold cavities. Refrigerate the mold until the gelatin is set,
   and firm to the touch, about 2 to 3 hours.
   [DSC_3946.jpg]
   Remove the mold from the refrigerator. With a small, sharp knife, cut
   jagged zig-zag breaks in each heart cavity, carefully removing one
   half. Try not to separate the other half from the edges of the mold.
   It’s a delicate procedure! Return the mold to the refrigerator.
   [DSC_3776.jpg]
   Prepare the marshmallow layer. Pour water into a saucepan. Sprinkle
   with gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two.
   [DSC_3782.jpg]
   Add the sweetened condensed milk. Heat over low heat, stirring
   occasionally, until gelatin is fully dissolved (just a few minutes).
   [DSC_3786.jpg]
   Stir in the marshmallow vodka, white chocolate liqueur.
   [DSC_3941.jpg]
   Assess your need for food coloring, and add if desired. (We used 1 drop
   of pink.) Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, 15 to 20
   minutes.
   [DSC_3949.jpg]
   Remove the mold from the refrigerator. Fill the empty parts of each
   heart cavity. Return the mold to the refrigerator and chill until fully
   set, several hours or overnight. Unmold just before serving.
   Raspberry Marshmallow-tini Jelly Shots
   Raspberry Layer
     * 2/3 cup lemon-lime soda (flat is best – avoids bubbles)
     * 2 envelopes plain gelatin (we use Knox brand, each envelope
       contains about 2 tsp gelatin powder – each envelope contains enough
       to gel 1 cup of jelly shot liquid)
     * 2/3 cup sweet and sour mix (or lemonade)
     * 2/3 cup raspberry flavored vodka (we used Hangar One Raspberry
       Vodka)
     * Pink or red liquid food coloring

   Marshmallow Layer
     * 1 cup water
     * 2 tbsp sweetened condensed milk
     * 1 envelope plain gelatin (we use Knox brand, each envelope contains
       about 2 tsp gelatin powder – which is enough to gel 1 cup of jelly
       shot liquid)
     * 2/3 cup vanilla flavored vodka
     * 1/3 cup Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur
     * Pink or red liquid food coloring

   Pan: Heart-shaped silicon mold (we used a 24-cavity Wilton brand
   silicon mold)
   Prepare your mold by spraying lightly with cooking spray, and then
   wiping each cavity clean. The idea is to leave only the slightest
   residue of spray to assist in unmolding your jelly shots.  Place the
   mold on a sturdy, portable flat surface, such as a cookie sheet or
   cutting board.
   Next, prepare the raspberry layer.  Pour the soda into a saucepan.
   Sprinkle with gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two. Heat over
   low heat, stirring occasionally, until gelatin is fully dissolved (just
   a few minutes). Stir in the sweet and sour mix (or lemonade) and vodka.
   Assess your need for food coloring, and if needed stir in a few drops
   of the pink or red food coloring. (Some vodka brands already have
   coloring in them and your mixture will not need any more – ours did.)
   Fill the mold cavities. Refrigerate the mold until the gelatin is set,
   and firm to the touch, about 2 to 3 hours.
   Remove the mold from the refrigerator. With a small, sharp knife, cut
   jagged zig-zag breaks in each heart cavity, carefully removing one
   half. Try not to separate the other half from the edges of the mold
   when removing. It’s a delicate procedure!  (If desired, set the gelatin
   remnants aside in covered bowl in the refrigerator - you can make a
   mosaic jelly shot later.)
   Return the mold to the refrigerator.
   Prepare the marshmallow layer. Pour water into a saucepan. Sprinkle
   with gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two. Add the sweetened
   condensed milk. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until
   gelatin is fully dissolved (just a few minutes).
   Stir in the marshmallow vodka, white chocolate liqueur. Assess your
   need for food coloring, and add if desired. (We used 1 drop of pink.)
   Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes.
   Remove the mold from the refrigerator. Fill the empty parts of each
   heart cavity. Return the mold to the refrigerator and chill until fully
   set, several hours or overnight. If refrigerating overnight, be sure to
   tent the mold with aluminum foil. Otherwise, the hearts will shrink and
   dry up. (Goodness, it seems like there is a metaphor in there
   somewhere, doesn’t it?)
   (If making mosaic gelatin from the remnants, retrieve the raspberry
   remnants from the refrigerator. Dice up a bit and place them in small
   container, evenly dispersed. Pour the marshmallow mixture over the top,
   refrigerate until set, and cut into cubes for serving)
   Unmold just before serving. To unmold, simply loosen the edges by
   gently pulling away from the side of the mold with your fingers. Then
   pop each jelly shot out onto your serving platter.
   Yield: 18 to 24 jelly shots

Allsorts Jelly Shot

   [DSC_3868_v3.jpg]
   [DSC_3909_crop.jpg]
   Sambuca. One of the most polarizing spirits, yet, oddly, one of the
   most often requested for jelly shot recipes, at least queries posted to
   my little blog. Like its candy inspiration, this jelly shot is a tamed
   version of licorice, balanced by a delicate, sweet creamy layer.
   And this jelly shot was also another opportunity to throw some click
   bait at the phenomenon that has been electrifying sex-starved suburbia
   for several years now. Of course I'm speaking of "Fifty Shades of
   Grey." Typically this is the point where I would add some literary puns
   relating to the qualities of the jelly shot versus the plot of the
   book/movie, but I don't feel qualified.  If there are any burning a
   hole in your keyboard, please do forward along. (Quite likely that I am
   the only person in North America who has not read the book, I think.
   Your dear M. has been living under a rock!)
   I hope you enjoy - so many of you have been wanting something with
   Sambuca. The addition of a creamy layer tames the Sambuca a touch - it
   is much more delicate and silky, but still stalwart enough for hard
   core licorice fans. That said, this jelly shot could easily be made
   with Kahlua or another liqueur in place of the Sambuca.
   I'll add some additional photos for the marbling treatment, however it
   truly is just as easy as dropping a warm mixture onto a partially set
   mixture in spoonfuls.  I'll also post a more traditional treatment at a
   later date.  You know the kind. Pastel-y. Allsorts-y.
   Cheers and XO!

   Prepare the white layer. Pour water into a saucepan. Sprinkle with
   gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two.
   [DSC_3782.jpg]
   Add the sweetened condensed milk. Heat over low heat, stirring
   occasionally, until gelatin is fully dissolved (just a few minutes).
   [DSC_3786.jpg]
    Remove from heat. Stir in the liqueur and vodka.
   [DSC_3788.jpg]
   Pour the white mixture into pan. Refrigerate until the mixture just
   barely begins to set, 15-20 minutes. It will be very wiggly, with a
   liquid appearance under the surface.
   [DSC_3792.jpg]
    If you have bubbles, chase them to the edge of the pan and crush them

   Prepare the Sambuca layer.  Pour water into a saucepan. Sprinkle with
   gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two. Heat over low heat,
   stirring occasionally, until gelatin is fully dissolved (just a few
   minutes).

    Stir in the Sambuca (and, if using, the black food coloring).
   [DSC_3799.jpg]
   Ladle the Sambuca mixture on top of the partially set white mixture.
   The warmer Sambuca mixture will break the partially-set white layer,
   forming the marbled pattern. The spooning is best completed in the
   refrigerator. Allow the jelly shots to complete the setting process, 3
   to 4 hours, or overnight.
   Licorice Allsorts Jelly Shot
   White Layer
     * 1/2 cup water
     * 2 tbsp sweetened condensed milk
     * 1 envelope plain gelatin (we use Knox brand, each envelope contains
       about 2 tsp gelatin powder – which is enough to gel 1 cup of jelly
       shot liquid)
     * 2/3 cup Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur
     * 1/3 cup vanilla flavored vodka

   Black Layer
     * 1/2 cup water
     * 1 envelope plain gelatin
     * 1/2 cup black Sambuca liqueur(or the clear with a few drops of
       black food coloring)

   Pan: standard non-reactive loaf pan (about 8" x 4")
   Prepare the white layer. Pour water into a saucepan. Sprinkle with
   gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two. Add the sweetened
   condensed milk. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until
   gelatin is fully dissolved (just a few minutes).
   Remove from heat. Stir in the liqueur and vodka.
   Pour the white mixture into pan. Refrigerate until the mixture just
   barely begins to set, 15-20 minutes. It will be very wiggly, with a
   liquid appearance under the surface.
   Prepare the Sambuca layer.  Pour water into a saucepan. Sprinkle with
   gelatin and allow to soak for a minute or two. Heat over low heat,
   stirring occasionally, until gelatin is fully dissolved (just a few
   minutes). Stir in the Sambuca, and, if using, the black food coloring.
   Ladle the Sambuca mixture on top of the partially set white mixture.
   The warmer Sambuca mixture will break the partially-set white layer,
   forming the marbled pattern. The spooning is best completed in the
   refrigerator.
   Allow the jelly shots to complete the setting process, 3 to 4 hours, or
   overnight.
   To serve, cut into cubes.
   Yield: 18 to 24 jelly shots

   Hello. Remember me? It’s been a while, but the Super Bowl is coming up.
   While I am not really a sporty sort, I always enjoy getting together
   with friends. And never is one more warmly welcomed than when one
   arrives with a plate of cupcakes.
   Jello Poke Cake is a pretty staple Midwestern dessert. It's pretty,
   easy and tastes great. It's also a vehicle for team spirit.
   I like to make this recipe over two days – preparing the cupcakes the
   evening before the event, and allowing them, and the layered jello shot
   mixtures to chill overnight. A few hours before the event, I frost the
   cupcakes, cut the jello shots into cubes and pop one on top of each
   cupcake.
   Any white cupcake will work for this recipe – so make from a mix, or
   buy from the store. I like to use Duncan Hines white cake mix, and I
   add one extra egg white, which makes it somehow more dense AND more
   fluffy. It is a great mix for this recipe because it is a very basic
   cake – and it will be loaded up with lots of flavorful gelatin
   goodness!
   Regarding saturation with the jello mixture, I like a consistent batch
   of cupcakes - so I have a bit of a method. For the first color of
   gelatin mix, I poke a 4-cornered square with one in the center. And
   with the second color, I poke 4 holes, kind of in-between each of the
   corners. Yeah, I know - pretty kooky - however, this way everything has
   a pretty consistent look, and is generally evenly saturated.
   The stabilized whipped frosting is an old farm recipe I found in an old
   cookbook. I use it for everything. It is easier to prepare than the
   traditional gelatin version, holds for days in the fridge, won’t budge
   on a serving tray, and is sturdy enough to be fluffy base for a gelatin
   cube.
   Jello Shot Cupcakes are a great opportunity to use up flavored rums and
   vodkas that could potentially be bursting out of the cupboard. Or maybe
   that is just me. Goes without saying that these can be made
   non-alcoholic by subbing more water for the booze. Hope you enjoy! More
   soon!

   Jello Shot Cupcakes
   Serves 24, serving size 1 Cupcake
   Implements
   BBQ skewer or chopstick for poking the cupcakes
   Squeeze bottle
   1 lb loaf pan (for setting up the jello shots)
   Saucepan, and spatula or spoon for stirring
   Sharp knife to cut jello shots
   Electric mixer
   Optional: frosting bag and tips (for icing), sprinkles for top
   Cupcakes
   24 plain white cupcakes, unfrosted, baked in paper cupcake wrappers
   Jello Shot Mixture - Color #1
   1 cup water
   1 envelope Knox gelatin (or other, 2.5 tsp of gelatin powder)
   1 box blue powdered gelatin mix (or color of your choice)
   1 cup flavored vodka
   Jello Shot Mixture - Color #2
   1 cup water
   1 envelope Knox gelatin (or other, 2.5 tsp of gelatin powder)
   1 box red powdered gelatin mix (or color of your choice)
   1 cup flavored vodka
   Whipped Cream Icing
   1 pint whipping cream
   2 tbsp dry vanilla instant pudding mix
   2 tbsp sugar
   1. Prepare your cupcakes. If baking your own cupcakes, just make sure
   to use a cupcake liner (helps contain the jello mixture) and cool the
   cupcakes completely before proceeding. To begin, poke 5 holes on top of
   the cupcake with skewer. Each hole should permeate the cupcake, i.e.
   poke until the top of the skewer touches, but does not puncture, the
   paper wrapper. Set cupcakes aside.
   2. Prepare Jello Shot Mixture #1. Pour one cup of water into saucepan,
   and sprinkle with one envelope of plain gelatin.  Allow gelatin to soak
   for a minute or two, until softened. Heat over medium low heat for a
   couple minutes, stirring constantly, until the gelatin dissolved. Add
   the flavored gelatin, stirring until it is fully combined. When the
   mixture is perfectly smooth, with no grains of gelatin or sugar, remove
   from heat, and stir in 1 cup of cold vodka. Allow mixture to cool to
   room temperature. (approximately 10 to 20 minutes)
   3. Pour 1 cup of Jello Shot Mixture #1 into loaf pan, and place in
   refrigerator to set.
   4. Add Jello Shot Mixture #1 to cupcakes. The remaining Jello Shot
   Mixture #1 into squeeze bottle. Invert cupcake and place one of the
   holes over the bottle nozzle. Flip cupcake, and give the bottle a very
   tiny squeeze. Repeat with other 4 holes. Continue process with
   remaining cupcakes. Place cupcakes into refrigerator.  Refrigerate for
   an hour or until jello inside the cupcake firms up.
   5. Prepare Jello Shot Mixture #2. Repeat steps in #2, using the second
   gelatin color. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature (approximately
   10 to 20 minutes).
   6. Check chilled jelly shot mixture. Is it set? It should be firm, but
   slightly tacky to the touch.  If set, carefully pour 1 cup of Jello
   Shot Mixture #2 on top of the set layer, and return the pan to the
   refrigerator.
   7. Prepare cupcakes. This time, poke 4 holes into each cupcake, sort of
   ‘in between’ the previously used holes.
   8. Add Jello Shot Mixture #2 to cupcakes, using procedure outlined in
   step 4 with each of the new holes. Continue process with remaining
   cupcakes. Place cupcakes into refrigerator.
   NEXT DAY .... OR SOME TIME LATER
   9. Cut the set jelly shots into squares with a sharp knife. On the
   corners in particular, you might see a bit of separation in the layers
   when you remove them from the pan. Just proceed carefully - this won't
   affect the finished jelly shots. (And besides, they are going on a
   mound of whipped cream and will be gobbled in seconds.)
   10.  Prepare whipped cream icing.
   11. Frost each cupcake, making sure to use enough to provide a sturdy
   home for a jello shot topper.
   12. Add a jello shot to each cupcake and top.
   13. Refrigerate until serving.
