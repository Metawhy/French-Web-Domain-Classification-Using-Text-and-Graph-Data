Testing the throttled delivery approach for 19H2

     Dona Sarkar and Brandon LeBlanc

   UPDATE 9/25: Today we have released 19H1 Build 18362.387 for Windows
   Insiders in Release Preview who are still on 19H1 only. This is just a
   small refresh update from Build 18362.385. We plan to enable this
   update for 19H2 soon.

   UPDATE 9/23: We have released 19H1 Build 18362.385 / 19H2 Build
   18363.385 (KB4517211) to the Release Preview ring.
     * Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are on 19H1 Build
       18362.329 will get 19H1 Build 18362.385 today.
     * Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are on 19H2 Build
       18363.329 will get 19H2 Build 18363.385 today.

   As a reminder, 19H1 and 19H2 share the same servicing content. That
   means they share the same Cumulative Update package.

   For Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are not yet on 19H2, you
   will continue to see a Windows 10, version 1909 update available If you
   go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. You can choose to
   install this update to receive 19H2 Build 18363.385 and future 19H2
   builds.

   This update contains all the same 19H2 features also available to
   Insiders in the Slow ring:
     * Windows containers require matched host and container version. This
       restricts customers and limits Windows containers from supporting
       mixed-version container pod scenarios This update includes 5 fixes
       to address this and allow the host to run down-level containers on
       up-level for process (Argon) isolation.
     * A fix to allow OEMs to reduce the inking latency based on the
       hardware capabilities of their devices rather than being stuck with
       latency selected on typical hardware configuration by the OS.
     * Key-rolling or Key-rotation feature enables secure rolling of
       Recovery passwords on MDM managed AAD devices upon on demand
       request from Microsoft Intune/MDM tools or upon every time recovery
       password is used to unlock the BitLocker protected drive. This
       feature will help prevent accidental recovery password disclosure
       as part of manual BitLocker drive unlock by users.
     * A change to enable third-party digital assistants to voice activate
       above the Lock screen.
     * You can now quickly create an event straight from the Calendar
       flyout on the Taskbar. Just click on the date and time at the lower
       right corner of the Taskbar to open the Calendar flyout and pick
       your desired date and start typing in the text box – you’ll now see
       inline options to set a time and location.
     * The navigation pane on the Start menu now expands when you hover
       over it with your mouse to better inform where clicking goes.
     * We have added friendly images to show what is meant by “banner” and
       “Action Center” when adjusting the notifications on apps in order
       to make these settings more approachable and understandable.
     * Notifications settings under Settings > System > Notifications will
       now default to sorting notification senders by most recently shown
       notification, rather than sender name. This makes it easier to find
       and configure frequent and recent senders. We have also added a
       setting to turn off playing sound when notifications appear.
     * We now show the options to configure and turn off notifications
       from an app/website right on the notification, both as a banner and
       in Action Center.
     * We have added a “Manage notifications” button to the top of Action
       Center that launches the main “Notifications & actions” Settings
       page.
     * We have added additional debugging capabilities for newer Intel
       processors. This is only relevant for hardware manufacturers.
     * We have made general battery life and power efficiency improvements
       for PCs with certain processors.
     * A CPU may have multiple “favored” cores (logical processors of the
       highest available scheduling class). To provide better performance
       and reliability, we have implemented a rotation policy that
       distributes work more fairly among these favored cores.
     * We have enabled Windows Defender Credential Guard for ARM64 devices
       for additional protection against credential theft for enterprises
       deploying ARM64 devices in their organizations.
     * We have enabled the ability for enterprises to supplement the
       Windows 10 in S Mode policy to allow traditional Win32 (desktop)
       apps from Microsoft Intune.
     * We’re updating the search box in File Explorer to now be powered by
       Windows Search. This change will help integrate your OneDrive
       content online with the traditional indexed results. More
       details here.
     * We have added the ability for Narrator and other assistive
       technologies to read and learn where the FN key is located on
       keyboards and what state it is in (locked versus unlocked).

   Additionally, this update will now be offered if you use Windows
   Defender Application Guard (WDAG) or containers.

   NOTE: We are continuing to push 19H2 out to 10% of Windows Insiders in
   the Release Preview ring automatically.

   UPDATE 9/5: We have increased the “seeker” experience for 19H2 in the
   Release Preview ring to 100%. This means that everyone in the Release
   Preview ring should see a Windows 10, version 1909 update available If
   they go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. Insiders who
   choose to install this update will be updated to 19H2 Build 18363.329.
   We are also beginning to push 19H2 out to 10% of Windows Insiders in
   the Release Preview ring as well. This means 10% of Insiders in the
   Release Preview should see 19H2 Build 18363.329 offered automatically.

   NOTE: IF your PC uses Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) or
   containers, you will not be offered this build of 19H2.

   UPDATE 8/29: We have released 19H1 Build 18362.329 and 19H2 Build
   18363.329 to Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring with the
   following fixes:
     * We fixed an issue where on devices with LTE capability, some SIM
       cards from certain carriers would not work correctly.
     * We fixed several issues resulting in bugchecks on some devices.

   To offer a clarification on these releases – 19H1 and 19H2 share the
   same servicing content. That means they share the same Cumulative
   Update package. For the small subset of Windows Insiders (the 10%) in
   Release Preview who were given the option to install 19H2, an
   enablement package is downloaded from Windows Update that turns on the
   19H2 features. This *changes* the build number for the OS from 19H1
   Build 18362 to 19H2 Build 18363. Because they use the same servicing
   content, the build revision number (the number that comes after the
   dot) will always match between 19H1 and 19H2. As we continue to test
   our servicing packages in the Release Preview ring, Insiders on 19H1
   and 19H2 will get a single Cumulative Update with the same fixes.

   [ORIGINAL POST FROM 8/26 BELOW]

   Hello Windows Insiders,

   Today, we are beginning to test the throttled approach we intend to use
   to rollout 19H2 to customers with Windows Insiders using the Release
   Preview ring. This is not the final 19H2 build that we intend to make
   available via the Release Preview ring once we are closer to launch.

   For a small subset of Insiders (around 10%) in the Release Preview
   ring, we have enabled the “seeker” experience for 19H2. For these
   Insiders, if they go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update,
   they will see that there is a Windows 10, version 1909 update
   available. They will be able to choose to download and install this
   update on their PC. After the update finishes, they will be on 19H2
   Build 18363.327.

   As John Cable mentioned in July, we will be delivering 19H2 to
   customers using our servicing technology (just like the monthly update
   process) for customers running the May 2019 Update (19H1). We have been
   testing 19H2 with Insiders in the Slow ring using the same baseline
   build number as the May 2019 Update but with an increased revision
   number like we normally use to show a build has been serviced with a
   Cumulative Update. However, to designate 19H2 as a feature update, we
   are revising the baseline build number by one full build.

   Insiders in the Release Preview ring who get 19H2 Build 18363.327 today
   will not see all the 19H2 features the Slow ring currently has as not
   all the features have been incorporated into the build yet. Because of
   the differences between the way the 19H2 updates are packaged between
   the Slow and Release Preview rings, Insiders in the Slow ring will not
   be able to switch to the Release Preview ring and get updates yet.
   Insiders who are thinking of switching rings should stay put for now.
   We will communicate to Insiders when it is ok to make the switch.

   Thanks,
   Dona and Brandon

Introducing Microsoft Edge Beta: Be one of the first to try it now

     Joe Belfiore

   Today I’m thrilled to announce that a Beta release for the next version
   of Microsoft Edge is now available for all supported versions of
   Windows and macOS. Our goal with Microsoft Edge is to create better web
   compatibility with better performance for our customers while ensuring
   less fragmentation of the web for all web developers. Our community has
   been with us on this journey from the beginning and your feedback is
   making it possible to rapidly improve. To date, there have been more
   than one million downloads of our preview builds, across all supported
   versions of Windows and Mac, from which we have received more than
   140,000 individual pieces of feedback. Thank you!

   Now that the Beta channel for the next version of Microsoft Edge is
   available, I’d like to call on all of you to jump in today and be some
   of the first to download and try it!

   Microsoft Edge Beta Channel: The next chapter

   Beta is the third and final preview channel which will come online
   before launch. As we release Beta, we remain committed to delivering a
   high-quality product and nailing the fundamentals of a great browsing
   experience. Beta represents the most stable preview channel, as
   features are added to Beta only after they have cleared quality testing
   in first the Canary channel and then the Dev channel. Major version
   updates can be expected roughly every six weeks, alongside periodic
   minor updates for bug fixes and security.

   While still in the preview stage, with this announcement the next
   version of Microsoft Edge is ready for everyday use. In the Beta today,
   you will see new ways to personalize your experience, along with
   support for 14 languages. With new tab page customization, you have the
   ability to choose what you want to see when you open a new web page by
   selecting either a Focused, Inspirational or Informational layout. You
   can also set a dark theme or visit the Microsoft Edge Insider Addons
   store or other Chromium-based web stores, such as the Chrome Web Store,
   to add your favorite extensions.

   You can personalize your experience further by enabling tracking
   prevention, a feature designed to protect you from being tracked by
   websites that you don’t visit. Today, this feature is behind a flag but
   you can enable it in the Beta builds. When enabled, a customer will be
   able to choose from three levels of privacy – Basic, Balanced and
   Strict. Additional features that we showed at the Build 2019 Conference
   will come to the Beta channel in the coming months. Collections
   is already available for testing in the Canary channel today.

   Microsoft Edge is getting even better for business

   Beta also includes many of the commercial features we announced at our
   Build conference, such as:
     * Microsoft Search built-in to Bing, which will reduce the time spent
       looking for things at work by intelligently connecting an
       organization’s people, documents, sites, locations and
       conversations.
     * Internet Explorer mode, which streamlines today’s not-so-great
       experience of viewing the web through two different browsers by
       bringing Internet Explorer 11 compatibility directly into Microsoft
       Edge, creating one simple experience. This
       is an important feature for the more than 60% of worldwide
       organizations that use both IE as well as another browser.

     * Windows Defender Application Guard helps to isolate
       enterprise-defined untrusted sites, protecting the company while
       employees browse the Internet.

   Additional features, like the enterprise-focused new tab, will be
   coming soon to the Canary and Dev channels as well.

   Security Bounty Program for Edge Beta

   With this Beta release, we are also announcing that we have extended
   the Microsoft Edge browser security bounty program to cover the Beta
   and Dev channels. We welcome researchers to seek out and disclose any
   high-impact vulnerabilities they may find in these channels and offer
   rewards up to US$30,000 for eligible vulnerabilities. See the MSRC
   blog for more details.

   Chromium contributions

   We are also continuing our commitment to be an active contributor to
   the Chromium community. To date, we’ve contributed more than 1,000
   commits to the Chromium project, and we look forward to continuing our
   active engagement with the community in the shared pursuit of making
   the web better for everyone.

   Time to try! Download Microsoft Edge Beta today

   If you are an enterprise customer, the next version of Microsoft Edge
   is ready to pilot with either Beta or Dev builds. We invite you to
   check out the enterprise tab of the Microsoft Edge Insider site,
   download a build and begin trialing it in your organization.

   If you are a consumer who is comfortable testing a beta, visit the
   Microsoft Edge Insider site to learn more and download the builds. Your
   feedback is critical in helping us build the future of Microsoft Edge
   and we’re excited to hear what you think.

   As with the Canary and Dev builds, if you’re not comfortable using
   early release software there is nothing for you to do today. Keep using
   the Microsoft Edge you know and love, and we’ll let you know when it’s
   time to make the move to the next version of the browser.

   Thanks again to everyone who has continued engaging with us on this
   journey. Stay tuned for more as we get closer to launch!

Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 18362.10022 (19H2)

     Dona Sarkar and Brandon LeBlanc

   Hello Windows Insiders!

   Today we are releasing 19H2 Build 18362.10022 to Windows Insiders in
   the Slow ring. This build includes the improvements and fixes from
   KB4515384 as well as general improvements to the overall quality of
   19H2.

   NOTE: For an explanation as to why the 19H2 build number in the Slow
   ring is different than the 19H2 build number in the Release Preview
   ring – see this blog post. We are working to move Insiders in the Slow
   ring to 19H2 Build 18363 builds.

   We also announced yesterday that we will begin making pre-release
   Windows 10 feature updates available to IT administrators using Windows
   Server Update Service (WSUS). For all the details, check out this blog
   post from Aria Carley. We also announced that Windows Insider Program
   for Business customers can now request Microsoft Support for Windows 10
   Version 1909 (19H2) builds in the Release Preview and Slow rings.

   As always, Insiders are encouraged to report any issues they experience
   with these updates through Feedback Hub.

   Thanks,
   Dona and Brandon

Testing the throttled delivery approach for 19H2

     Dona Sarkar and Brandon LeBlanc

   UPDATE 9/25: Today we have released 19H1 Build 18362.387 for Windows
   Insiders in Release Preview who are still on 19H1 only. This is just a
   small refresh update from Build 18362.385. We plan to enable this
   update for 19H2 soon.

   UPDATE 9/23: We have released 19H1 Build 18362.385 / 19H2 Build
   18363.385 (KB4517211) to the Release Preview ring.
     * Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are on 19H1 Build
       18362.329 will get 19H1 Build 18362.385 today.
     * Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are on 19H2 Build
       18363.329 will get 19H2 Build 18363.385 today.

   As a reminder, 19H1 and 19H2 share the same servicing content. That
   means they share the same Cumulative Update package.

   For Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are not yet on 19H2, you
   will continue to see a Windows 10, version 1909 update available If you
   go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. You can choose to
   install this update to receive 19H2 Build 18363.385 and future 19H2
   builds.

   This update contains all the same 19H2 features also available to
   Insiders in the Slow ring:
     * Windows containers require matched host and container version. This
       restricts customers and limits Windows containers from supporting
       mixed-version container pod scenarios This update includes 5 fixes
       to address this and allow the host to run down-level containers on
       up-level for process (Argon) isolation.
     * A fix to allow OEMs to reduce the inking latency based on the
       hardware capabilities of their devices rather than being stuck with
       latency selected on typical hardware configuration by the OS.
     * Key-rolling or Key-rotation feature enables secure rolling of
       Recovery passwords on MDM managed AAD devices upon on demand
       request from Microsoft Intune/MDM tools or upon every time recovery
       password is used to unlock the BitLocker protected drive. This
       feature will help prevent accidental recovery password disclosure
       as part of manual BitLocker drive unlock by users.
     * A change to enable third-party digital assistants to voice activate
       above the Lock screen.
     * You can now quickly create an event straight from the Calendar
       flyout on the Taskbar. Just click on the date and time at the lower
       right corner of the Taskbar to open the Calendar flyout and pick
       your desired date and start typing in the text box – you’ll now see
       inline options to set a time and location.
     * The navigation pane on the Start menu now expands when you hover
       over it with your mouse to better inform where clicking goes.
     * We have added friendly images to show what is meant by “banner” and
       “Action Center” when adjusting the notifications on apps in order
       to make these settings more approachable and understandable.
     * Notifications settings under Settings > System > Notifications will
       now default to sorting notification senders by most recently shown
       notification, rather than sender name. This makes it easier to find
       and configure frequent and recent senders. We have also added a
       setting to turn off playing sound when notifications appear.
     * We now show the options to configure and turn off notifications
       from an app/website right on the notification, both as a banner and
       in Action Center.
     * We have added a “Manage notifications” button to the top of Action
       Center that launches the main “Notifications & actions” Settings
       page.
     * We have added additional debugging capabilities for newer Intel
       processors. This is only relevant for hardware manufacturers.
     * We have made general battery life and power efficiency improvements
       for PCs with certain processors.
     * A CPU may have multiple “favored” cores (logical processors of the
       highest available scheduling class). To provide better performance
       and reliability, we have implemented a rotation policy that
       distributes work more fairly among these favored cores.
     * We have enabled Windows Defender Credential Guard for ARM64 devices
       for additional protection against credential theft for enterprises
       deploying ARM64 devices in their organizations.
     * We have enabled the ability for enterprises to supplement the
       Windows 10 in S Mode policy to allow traditional Win32 (desktop)
       apps from Microsoft Intune.
     * We’re updating the search box in File Explorer to now be powered by
       Windows Search. This change will help integrate your OneDrive
       content online with the traditional indexed results. More
       details here.
     * We have added the ability for Narrator and other assistive
       technologies to read and learn where the FN key is located on
       keyboards and what state it is in (locked versus unlocked).

   Additionally, this update will now be offered if you use Windows
   Defender Application Guard (WDAG) or containers.

   NOTE: We are continuing to push 19H2 out to 10% of Windows Insiders in
   the Release Preview ring automatically.

   UPDATE 9/5: We have increased the “seeker” experience for 19H2 in the
   Release Preview ring to 100%. This means that everyone in the Release
   Preview ring should see a Windows 10, version 1909 update available If
   they go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. Insiders who
   choose to install this update will be updated to 19H2 Build 18363.329.
   We are also beginning to push 19H2 out to 10% of Windows Insiders in
   the Release Preview ring as well. This means 10% of Insiders in the
   Release Preview should see 19H2 Build 18363.329 offered automatically.

   NOTE: IF your PC uses Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) or
   containers, you will not be offered this build of 19H2.

   UPDATE 8/29: We have released 19H1 Build 18362.329 and 19H2 Build
   18363.329 to Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring with the
   following fixes:
     * We fixed an issue where on devices with LTE capability, some SIM
       cards from certain carriers would not work correctly.
     * We fixed several issues resulting in bugchecks on some devices.

   To offer a clarification on these releases – 19H1 and 19H2 share the
   same servicing content. That means they share the same Cumulative
   Update package. For the small subset of Windows Insiders (the 10%) in
   Release Preview who were given the option to install 19H2, an
   enablement package is downloaded from Windows Update that turns on the
   19H2 features. This *changes* the build number for the OS from 19H1
   Build 18362 to 19H2 Build 18363. Because they use the same servicing
   content, the build revision number (the number that comes after the
   dot) will always match between 19H1 and 19H2. As we continue to test
   our servicing packages in the Release Preview ring, Insiders on 19H1
   and 19H2 will get a single Cumulative Update with the same fixes.

   [ORIGINAL POST FROM 8/26 BELOW]

   Hello Windows Insiders,

   Today, we are beginning to test the throttled approach we intend to use
   to rollout 19H2 to customers with Windows Insiders using the Release
   Preview ring. This is not the final 19H2 build that we intend to make
   available via the Release Preview ring once we are closer to launch.

   For a small subset of Insiders (around 10%) in the Release Preview
   ring, we have enabled the “seeker” experience for 19H2. For these
   Insiders, if they go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update,
   they will see that there is a Windows 10, version 1909 update
   available. They will be able to choose to download and install this
   update on their PC. After the update finishes, they will be on 19H2
   Build 18363.327.

   As John Cable mentioned in July, we will be delivering 19H2 to
   customers using our servicing technology (just like the monthly update
   process) for customers running the May 2019 Update (19H1). We have been
   testing 19H2 with Insiders in the Slow ring using the same baseline
   build number as the May 2019 Update but with an increased revision
   number like we normally use to show a build has been serviced with a
   Cumulative Update. However, to designate 19H2 as a feature update, we
   are revising the baseline build number by one full build.

   Insiders in the Release Preview ring who get 19H2 Build 18363.327 today
   will not see all the 19H2 features the Slow ring currently has as not
   all the features have been incorporated into the build yet. Because of
   the differences between the way the 19H2 updates are packaged between
   the Slow and Release Preview rings, Insiders in the Slow ring will not
   be able to switch to the Release Preview ring and get updates yet.
   Insiders who are thinking of switching rings should stay put for now.
   We will communicate to Insiders when it is ok to make the switch.

   Thanks,
   Dona and Brandon

Introducing Microsoft Edge Beta: Be one of the first to try it now

     Joe Belfiore

   Today I’m thrilled to announce that a Beta release for the next version
   of Microsoft Edge is now available for all supported versions of
   Windows and macOS. Our goal with Microsoft Edge is to create better web
   compatibility with better performance for our customers while ensuring
   less fragmentation of the web for all web developers. Our community has
   been with us on this journey from the beginning and your feedback is
   making it possible to rapidly improve. To date, there have been more
   than one million downloads of our preview builds, across all supported
   versions of Windows and Mac, from which we have received more than
   140,000 individual pieces of feedback. Thank you!

   Now that the Beta channel for the next version of Microsoft Edge is
   available, I’d like to call on all of you to jump in today and be some
   of the first to download and try it!

   Microsoft Edge Beta Channel: The next chapter

   Beta is the third and final preview channel which will come online
   before launch. As we release Beta, we remain committed to delivering a
   high-quality product and nailing the fundamentals of a great browsing
   experience. Beta represents the most stable preview channel, as
   features are added to Beta only after they have cleared quality testing
   in first the Canary channel and then the Dev channel. Major version
   updates can be expected roughly every six weeks, alongside periodic
   minor updates for bug fixes and security.

   While still in the preview stage, with this announcement the next
   version of Microsoft Edge is ready for everyday use. In the Beta today,
   you will see new ways to personalize your experience, along with
   support for 14 languages. With new tab page customization, you have the
   ability to choose what you want to see when you open a new web page by
   selecting either a Focused, Inspirational or Informational layout. You
   can also set a dark theme or visit the Microsoft Edge Insider Addons
   store or other Chromium-based web stores, such as the Chrome Web Store,
   to add your favorite extensions.

   You can personalize your experience further by enabling tracking
   prevention, a feature designed to protect you from being tracked by
   websites that you don’t visit. Today, this feature is behind a flag but
   you can enable it in the Beta builds. When enabled, a customer will be
   able to choose from three levels of privacy – Basic, Balanced and
   Strict. Additional features that we showed at the Build 2019 Conference
   will come to the Beta channel in the coming months. Collections
   is already available for testing in the Canary channel today.

   Microsoft Edge is getting even better for business

   Beta also includes many of the commercial features we announced at our
   Build conference, such as:
     * Microsoft Search built-in to Bing, which will reduce the time spent
       looking for things at work by intelligently connecting an
       organization’s people, documents, sites, locations and
       conversations.
     * Internet Explorer mode, which streamlines today’s not-so-great
       experience of viewing the web through two different browsers by
       bringing Internet Explorer 11 compatibility directly into Microsoft
       Edge, creating one simple experience. This
       is an important feature for the more than 60% of worldwide
       organizations that use both IE as well as another browser.

     * Windows Defender Application Guard helps to isolate
       enterprise-defined untrusted sites, protecting the company while
       employees browse the Internet.

   Additional features, like the enterprise-focused new tab, will be
   coming soon to the Canary and Dev channels as well.

   Security Bounty Program for Edge Beta

   With this Beta release, we are also announcing that we have extended
   the Microsoft Edge browser security bounty program to cover the Beta
   and Dev channels. We welcome researchers to seek out and disclose any
   high-impact vulnerabilities they may find in these channels and offer
   rewards up to US$30,000 for eligible vulnerabilities. See the MSRC
   blog for more details.

   Chromium contributions

   We are also continuing our commitment to be an active contributor to
   the Chromium community. To date, we’ve contributed more than 1,000
   commits to the Chromium project, and we look forward to continuing our
   active engagement with the community in the shared pursuit of making
   the web better for everyone.

   Time to try! Download Microsoft Edge Beta today

   If you are an enterprise customer, the next version of Microsoft Edge
   is ready to pilot with either Beta or Dev builds. We invite you to
   check out the enterprise tab of the Microsoft Edge Insider site,
   download a build and begin trialing it in your organization.

   If you are a consumer who is comfortable testing a beta, visit the
   Microsoft Edge Insider site to learn more and download the builds. Your
   feedback is critical in helping us build the future of Microsoft Edge
   and we’re excited to hear what you think.

   As with the Canary and Dev builds, if you’re not comfortable using
   early release software there is nothing for you to do today. Keep using
   the Microsoft Edge you know and love, and we’ll let you know when it’s
   time to make the move to the next version of the browser.

   Thanks again to everyone who has continued engaging with us on this
   journey. Stay tuned for more as we get closer to launch!

Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 18362.10022 (19H2)

     Dona Sarkar and Brandon LeBlanc

   Hello Windows Insiders!

   Today we are releasing 19H2 Build 18362.10022 to Windows Insiders in
   the Slow ring. This build includes the improvements and fixes from
   KB4515384 as well as general improvements to the overall quality of
   19H2.

   NOTE: For an explanation as to why the 19H2 build number in the Slow
   ring is different than the 19H2 build number in the Release Preview
   ring – see this blog post. We are working to move Insiders in the Slow
   ring to 19H2 Build 18363 builds.

   We also announced yesterday that we will begin making pre-release
   Windows 10 feature updates available to IT administrators using Windows
   Server Update Service (WSUS). For all the details, check out this blog
   post from Aria Carley. We also announced that Windows Insider Program
   for Business customers can now request Microsoft Support for Windows 10
   Version 1909 (19H2) builds in the Release Preview and Slow rings.

   As always, Insiders are encouraged to report any issues they experience
   with these updates through Feedback Hub.

   Thanks,
   Dona and Brandon

Testing the throttled delivery approach for 19H2

   By Dona Sarkar and Brandon LeBlanc
   Share Tweet Share Share (BUTTON) Skype

   UPDATE 9/25: Today we have released 19H1 Build 18362.387 for Windows
   Insiders in Release Preview who are still on 19H1 only. This is just a
   small refresh update from Build 18362.385. We plan to enable this
   update for 19H2 soon.

   UPDATE 9/23: We have released 19H1 Build 18362.385 / 19H2 Build
   18363.385 (KB4517211) to the Release Preview ring.
     * Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are on 19H1 Build
       18362.329 will get 19H1 Build 18362.385 today.
     * Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are on 19H2 Build
       18363.329 will get 19H2 Build 18363.385 today.

   As a reminder, 19H1 and 19H2 share the same servicing content. That
   means they share the same Cumulative Update package.

   For Insiders in the Release Preview ring who are not yet on 19H2, you
   will continue to see a Windows 10, version 1909 update available If you
   go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. You can choose to
   install this update to receive 19H2 Build 18363.385 and future 19H2
   builds.

   This update contains all the same 19H2 features also available to
   Insiders in the Slow ring:
     * Windows containers require matched host and container version. This
       restricts customers and limits Windows containers from supporting
       mixed-version container pod scenarios This update includes 5 fixes
       to address this and allow the host to run down-level containers on
       up-level for process (Argon) isolation.
     * A fix to allow OEMs to reduce the inking latency based on the
       hardware capabilities of their devices rather than being stuck with
       latency selected on typical hardware configuration by the OS.
     * Key-rolling or Key-rotation feature enables secure rolling of
       Recovery passwords on MDM managed AAD devices upon on demand
       request from Microsoft Intune/MDM tools or upon every time recovery
       password is used to unlock the BitLocker protected drive. This
       feature will help prevent accidental recovery password disclosure
       as part of manual BitLocker drive unlock by users.
     * A change to enable third-party digital assistants to voice activate
       above the Lock screen.
     * You can now quickly create an event straight from the Calendar
       flyout on the Taskbar. Just click on the date and time at the lower
       right corner of the Taskbar to open the Calendar flyout and pick
       your desired date and start typing in the text box – you’ll now see
       inline options to set a time and location.
       Add events directly from the Calendar flyout on your Taskbar!
     * The navigation pane on the Start menu now expands when you hover
       over it with your mouse to better inform where clicking goes.
     * We have added friendly images to show what is meant by “banner” and
       “Action Center” when adjusting the notifications on apps in order
       to make these settings more approachable and understandable.
       We have added friendly images to show what is meant by "banner" and
       "Action Center" when adjusting the notifications on apps.
     * Notifications settings under Settings > System > Notifications will
       now default to sorting notification senders by most recently shown
       notification, rather than sender name. This makes it easier to find
       and configure frequent and recent senders. We have also added a
       setting to turn off playing sound when notifications appear.
     * We now show the options to configure and turn off notifications
       from an app/website right on the notification, both as a banner and
       in Action Center.
     * We have added a “Manage notifications” button to the top of Action
       Center that launches the main “Notifications & actions” Settings
       page.
     * We have added additional debugging capabilities for newer Intel
       processors. This is only relevant for hardware manufacturers.
     * We have made general battery life and power efficiency improvements
       for PCs with certain processors.
     * A CPU may have multiple “favored” cores (logical processors of the
       highest available scheduling class). To provide better performance
       and reliability, we have implemented a rotation policy that
       distributes work more fairly among these favored cores.
     * We have enabled Windows Defender Credential Guard for ARM64 devices
       for additional protection against credential theft for enterprises
       deploying ARM64 devices in their organizations.
     * We have enabled the ability for enterprises to supplement the
       Windows 10 in S Mode policy to allow traditional Win32 (desktop)
       apps from Microsoft Intune.
     * We’re updating the search box in File Explorer to now be powered by
       Windows Search. This change will help integrate your OneDrive
       content online with the traditional indexed results. More
       details here.
     * We have added the ability for Narrator and other assistive
       technologies to read and learn where the FN key is located on
       keyboards and what state it is in (locked versus unlocked).

   Additionally, this update will now be offered if you use Windows
   Defender Application Guard (WDAG) or containers.

   NOTE: We are continuing to push 19H2 out to 10% of Windows Insiders in
   the Release Preview ring automatically.

   UPDATE 9/5: We have increased the “seeker” experience for 19H2 in the
   Release Preview ring to 100%. This means that everyone in the Release
   Preview ring should see a Windows 10, version 1909 update available If
   they go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. Insiders who
   choose to install this update will be updated to 19H2 Build 18363.329.
   We are also beginning to push 19H2 out to 10% of Windows Insiders in
   the Release Preview ring as well. This means 10% of Insiders in the
   Release Preview should see 19H2 Build 18363.329 offered automatically.

   NOTE: IF your PC uses Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) or
   containers, you will not be offered this build of 19H2.

   UPDATE 8/29: We have released 19H1 Build 18362.329 and 19H2 Build
   18363.329 to Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring with the
   following fixes:
     * We fixed an issue where on devices with LTE capability, some SIM
       cards from certain carriers would not work correctly.
     * We fixed several issues resulting in bugchecks on some devices.

   To offer a clarification on these releases – 19H1 and 19H2 share the
   same servicing content. That means they share the same Cumulative
   Update package. For the small subset of Windows Insiders (the 10%) in
   Release Preview who were given the option to install 19H2, an
   enablement package is downloaded from Windows Update that turns on the
   19H2 features. This *changes* the build number for the OS from 19H1
   Build 18362 to 19H2 Build 18363. Because they use the same servicing
   content, the build revision number (the number that comes after the
   dot) will always match between 19H1 and 19H2. As we continue to test
   our servicing packages in the Release Preview ring, Insiders on 19H1
   and 19H2 will get a single Cumulative Update with the same fixes.

   [ORIGINAL POST FROM 8/26 BELOW]

   Hello Windows Insiders,

   Today, we are beginning to test the throttled approach we intend to use
   to rollout 19H2 to customers with Windows Insiders using the Release
   Preview ring. This is not the final 19H2 build that we intend to make
   available via the Release Preview ring once we are closer to launch.

   For a small subset of Insiders (around 10%) in the Release Preview
   ring, we have enabled the “seeker” experience for 19H2. For these
   Insiders, if they go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update,
   they will see that there is a Windows 10, version 1909 update
   available. They will be able to choose to download and install this
   update on their PC. After the update finishes, they will be on 19H2
   Build 18363.327.

   As John Cable mentioned in July, we will be delivering 19H2 to
   customers using our servicing technology (just like the monthly update
   process) for customers running the May 2019 Update (19H1). We have been
   testing 19H2 with Insiders in the Slow ring using the same baseline
   build number as the May 2019 Update but with an increased revision
   number like we normally use to show a build has been serviced with a
   Cumulative Update. However, to designate 19H2 as a feature update, we
   are revising the baseline build number by one full build.

   Insiders in the Release Preview ring who get 19H2 Build 18363.327 today
   will not see all the 19H2 features the Slow ring currently has as not
   all the features have been incorporated into the build yet. Because of
   the differences between the way the 19H2 updates are packaged between
   the Slow and Release Preview rings, Insiders in the Slow ring will not
   be able to switch to the Release Preview ring and get updates yet.
   Insiders who are thinking of switching rings should stay put for now.
   We will communicate to Insiders when it is ok to make the switch.

   Thanks,
   Dona and Brandon

Introducing Microsoft Edge Beta: Be one of the first to try it now

   By Joe Belfiore / Corporate Vice President, Windows
   Share Tweet Share Share (BUTTON) Skype

   Screenshot of Microsoft Edge Beta screen

   Today I’m thrilled to announce that a Beta release for the next version
   of Microsoft Edge is now available for all supported versions of
   Windows and macOS. Our goal with Microsoft Edge is to create better web
   compatibility with better performance for our customers while ensuring
   less fragmentation of the web for all web developers. Our community has
   been with us on this journey from the beginning and your feedback is
   making it possible to rapidly improve. To date, there have been more
   than one million downloads of our preview builds, across all supported
   versions of Windows and Mac, from which we have received more than
   140,000 individual pieces of feedback. Thank you!

   Now that the Beta channel for the next version of Microsoft Edge is
   available, I’d like to call on all of you to jump in today and be some
   of the first to download and try it!

   Microsoft Edge Beta Channel: The next chapter

   Illustration showing construction of the Microsoft Edge Beta browser on
   a laptop

   Beta is the third and final preview channel which will come online
   before launch. As we release Beta, we remain committed to delivering a
   high-quality product and nailing the fundamentals of a great browsing
   experience. Beta represents the most stable preview channel, as
   features are added to Beta only after they have cleared quality testing
   in first the Canary channel and then the Dev channel. Major version
   updates can be expected roughly every six weeks, alongside periodic
   minor updates for bug fixes and security.

   While still in the preview stage, with this announcement the next
   version of Microsoft Edge is ready for everyday use. In the Beta today,
   you will see new ways to personalize your experience, along with
   support for 14 languages. With new tab page customization, you have the
   ability to choose what you want to see when you open a new web page by
   selecting either a Focused, Inspirational or Informational layout. You
   can also set a dark theme or visit the Microsoft Edge Insider Addons
   store or other Chromium-based web stores, such as the Chrome Web Store,
   to add your favorite extensions.

   You can personalize your experience further by enabling tracking
   prevention, a feature designed to protect you from being tracked by
   websites that you don’t visit. Today, this feature is behind a flag but
   you can enable it in the Beta builds. When enabled, a customer will be
   able to choose from three levels of privacy – Basic, Balanced and
   Strict. Additional features that we showed at the Build 2019 Conference
   will come to the Beta channel in the coming months. Collections
   is already available for testing in the Canary channel today.

   Microsoft Edge is getting even better for business

   Beta also includes many of the commercial features we announced at our
   Build conference, such as:
     * Microsoft Search built-in to Bing, which will reduce the time spent
       looking for things at work by intelligently connecting an
       organization’s people, documents, sites, locations and
       conversations.
     * Internet Explorer mode, which streamlines today’s not-so-great
       experience of viewing the web through two different browsers by
       bringing Internet Explorer 11 compatibility directly into Microsoft
       Edge, creating one simple experience. This
       is an important feature for the more than 60% of worldwide
       organizations that use both IE as well as another browser.

     * Windows Defender Application Guard helps to isolate
       enterprise-defined untrusted sites, protecting the company while
       employees browse the Internet.

   Additional features, like the enterprise-focused new tab, will be
   coming soon to the Canary and Dev channels as well.

   Security Bounty Program for Edge Beta

   With this Beta release, we are also announcing that we have extended
   the Microsoft Edge browser security bounty program to cover the Beta
   and Dev channels. We welcome researchers to seek out and disclose any
   high-impact vulnerabilities they may find in these channels and offer
   rewards up to US$30,000 for eligible vulnerabilities. See the MSRC
   blog for more details.

   Chromium contributions

   We are also continuing our commitment to be an active contributor to
   the Chromium community. To date, we’ve contributed more than 1,000
   commits to the Chromium project, and we look forward to continuing our
   active engagement with the community in the shared pursuit of making
   the web better for everyone.

   Time to try! Download Microsoft Edge Beta today

   If you are an enterprise customer, the next version of Microsoft Edge
   is ready to pilot with either Beta or Dev builds. We invite you to
   check out the enterprise tab of the Microsoft Edge Insider site,
   download a build and begin trialing it in your organization.

   If you are a consumer who is comfortable testing a beta, visit the
   Microsoft Edge Insider site to learn more and download the builds. Your
   feedback is critical in helping us build the future of Microsoft Edge
   and we’re excited to hear what you think.

   Screenshot of Microsoft Edge Insider Channels

   As with the Canary and Dev builds, if you’re not comfortable using
   early release software there is nothing for you to do today. Keep using
   the Microsoft Edge you know and love, and we’ll let you know when it’s
   time to make the move to the next version of the browser.

   Thanks again to everyone who has continued engaging with us on this
   journey. Stay tuned for more as we get closer to launch!

Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 18362.10022 (19H2)

   By Dona Sarkar and Brandon LeBlanc
   Share Tweet Share Share (BUTTON) Skype

   Hello Windows Insiders!

   Today we are releasing 19H2 Build 18362.10022 to Windows Insiders in
   the Slow ring. This build includes the improvements and fixes from
   KB4515384 as well as general improvements to the overall quality of
   19H2.

   NOTE: For an explanation as to why the 19H2 build number in the Slow
   ring is different than the 19H2 build number in the Release Preview
   ring – see this blog post. We are working to move Insiders in the Slow
   ring to 19H2 Build 18363 builds.

   We also announced yesterday that we will begin making pre-release
   Windows 10 feature updates available to IT administrators using Windows
   Server Update Service (WSUS). For all the details, check out this blog
   post from Aria Carley. We also announced that Windows Insider Program
   for Business customers can now request Microsoft Support for Windows 10
   Version 1909 (19H2) builds in the Release Preview and Slow rings.

   As always, Insiders are encouraged to report any issues they experience
   with these updates through Feedback Hub.

   Thanks,
   Dona and Brandon
