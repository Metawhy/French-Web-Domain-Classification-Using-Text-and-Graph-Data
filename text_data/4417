   Al Bashir Case
   The Prosecutor v. Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir
   ICC-02/05-01/09
   Pre-trial

   The first warrant for arrest for Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir was issued
   on 4 March 2009, the second on 12 July 2010. The suspect is still at
   large.

   Next steps: Until Omar Al Bashir is arrested and transferred to the
   seat of the Court in The Hague, the case will remain in the Pre-Trial
   stage. The ICC does not try individuals unless they are present in the
   courtroom.
