   Q: Why do you have a Brutalist Website?
   A: To be honest, I never thought to have or to design a brutalist
   website. I end up with my actual page because while I was updating the
   website and also my projects, I decided that I wanted to show only with
   the use of typography and codes who I am and most important what I do.
   I used some simple codes which they helped me to communicate in a
   visual language different concepts. I have always been interested in
   storytelling because I consider it as a form of interactive art where
   the storyteller can use words to tell a story while someone is
   listening and most important is using his imagination to figured out
   the story. Magic! So I thought, what happen when this form of art meets
   technology and its tools? This is what my website is all about.

   Q: Why do you have a Brutalist Website?
   A: Wikipedia says Brutalist buildings are usually formed with repeated
   modular elements forming masses representing specific functional zones…
   In the case of the design of this website, we generally only used 2
   type sizes and rules, which became the repeated modular elements. We
   felt that the undesigned aesthetic was right for the content, which in
   this case, is a collection of surveillance related photography books.
