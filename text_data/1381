New Things, New York & Happy New Year

   [black&amp;spiro-2014-2.jpg]
   Hello.  Happy New Year.  How is it March already?  I know its a cliché
   but time really does fly.  We've had a nice start to 2014.  Some good
   projects are on the go and we've been busy stocking up the store again
   after a busy Christmas period..  Olivia and I travelled to New York
   early February where we spent 10 days trudging around in snow and
   freezing conditions to find some wonderful things for Black & Spiro.
   Some of my favourite finds can be seen above including vintage
   paintings and one-off textiles.  We still have things arriving weekly
   from the trip so make sure you pop into the shop for a visit if you are
   looking for something extra special.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-13.jpg]
   Central Park was like, as one of my instagram followers said, 'a scene
   out of The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe'.  Pure Magic especially for
   2 Aussie girls used to the unbearable humidity in Brisbane.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-9.jpg]
   Visiting New York's vintage markets is one of my favourite things to
   do.  There is just so much and so little luggage space that making a
   decision on what comes and what has to stay is very difficult.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-12.jpg]



   [black&amp;spiro-2014-18ab.jpg]

   I usually always have a buying regret, and this trip was no different.
   On our last day I found this wonderful book that I should have bought
   and now so desperately wish I had but alas, we had so much to get home
   and I had to leave it behind.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-5a.png]
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-10.jpg]
   Olivia's first trip to the Big Apple and the weather certainly turned
   it on for her!  She was in snow heaven.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-15.jpg]
   Bergdorf's incredible displays did not disappoint.  This painted fan
   installation was just randomly placed in a section upstairs in the
   store.  So much work and so much creative thought that must go into
   every single display project they produce.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-8.jpg]
   For me, a trip to NYC wouldn't be complete without a meal at my fave
   Osteria Morini in Soho.  Simple, traditional, hearty Italian.  Love it
   so much.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-16.jpg]

   We also visited Freemans for a bowl of warm soup after our visit to
   John Derian's divine stores just around the corner.  I was sad to see
   that Peels had closed just a few weeks prior to our visit!!
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-11.png]
   We loved catching up with Jamie Meares from Furbish Studio and her
   lovely assistant at Tipsy Parson.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-14.jpg]
   This trip, we stayed in mid-town at The NoMad and I was so taken with
   the building that we looked out onto from our room and hotel rooftop.
   One of my instagram followers informed me that it is the home of the
   very fashionable Isabel and Ruben Toledo!  Click HERE to read and see
   more about them and their seriously amazing home in the clouds!
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-7.jpg]
   Our busy week in NY came to an end.  We had a fabulous time and came
   home with lots of beautiful things and lots of great inspiration for
   our year ahead.
   [black&amp;spiro-2014-3.jpg]
   Despite all that New York is, I was so happy to come home to this!

Buzz - Our Latest Restaurant Project

   [buzz-11.png]
   Earlier this year we were asked to visit the new Gas Works development
   in Newstead where Margot McKinney & Peter Kedwell planned on opening
   their 4th Buzz Restaurant.  It was a late Autumn afternoon and the
   skies were a pale blue fading into a warm soft pink.  What greeted
   us on site was a gigantic concrete jungle with shards of aluminium,
   rocks, plastic, air-conditioning vents, building tools and lots of
   scaffolding.
   [buzz-16s.jpg]
   [buzz-15.jpg]
   The Kedwell-McKinney brief was for us to help them create a restaurant
   that felt comfortable, was fresh, light and open, with lots of appeal
   and interest for their customers and somewhere for people to also enjoy
   dinner (as Buzz is mostly known for their fab breakfasts and
   lunches) or even just a drink at the bar.
   [buzz-9.jpg]
   We used Peter Kedwell's history and career in the fruit and vegetable
   industry as our inspiration for the project.  Fresh food and market
   produce became our main focus for the colours, materials and ideas we
   presented.
   [buzz-12.jpg]
   We also wanted the restaurant to have a warm, almost lived-in, country
   farmhouse-type atmosphere and this image above provided us
   with inspiration to use bagged brick, timber and zinc in the finishes.
   [buzz+lights1.png]
   The fabulous big black industrial lights we found in France look
   wonderful hanging in the space and have you spotted the little
   terracotta plant-pot lights hanging over the central bar?  I came up
   with the idea when I was in my garden potting terracotta pots just
   before we presented the concept.  It was like a little garden angel
   reached out to me and said - wouldn't they look great turned upside
   down and used as lights at Buzz!  Again, this played wonderfully on the
   garden/market theme.
   [buzz-13a.png]

   ﻿
   This fabulously detailed green door that Alexandra Macmillan posted on
   her Pinterest page was the perfect piece of inspiration we needed for
   our cabinetry design and colour.

   [blog-buzz-oct-2013-1a.jpg]
   It's just so wonderful when you start to see your ideas and vision for
   a project come together and  just as you had planned in your head.
   Site visits just got better and better as each day passed just prior to
   the restaurant opening last weekend.
   [blog-buzz-oct-2013-3.jpg]
   One of my favourite things we created was the old cane market basket
   wall.  We collected up a bunch of old baskets from all over the place
   including a few that came from my own collection at home.

   [buzz-6a.jpg]

   Another favourite thing is the back-lit shutter panelling we devised
   and installed over the large ugly round column as above.
   [buzz-5.jpg]
   And although in our original concept we had suggested to use old market
   posters adhered directly to the bare concrete wall, the wonderful
   vintage Queensland paw-paw girl that Margot found certainly is a
   fabulous fit.
   [buzz-7.jpg]
   As in any project, some things don't arrive on time so the stools you
   see in this section of the restaurant aren't permanent.  We have some
   new ones arriving in the next little while...well actually who knows
   when!!  Notice the lovely collection of old vintage green and white and
   black and white plates we hung on the wall just above the
   kitchen-pass....another favourite thing.
   [Buzz-b.png]
   [Buzz-a.png]
   [buzz-4.jpg]
    And finally, one last favourite thing is the beautiful blackboard we
   created.  This back-piece to an old sideboard we once had found it's
   perfect resting place here.  Olivia and I painted it with black-board
   paint ourselves and we asked Vanessa Macphail to do her thing with the
   lettering.
   [buzz-2.jpg]
   [buzz-1.jpg]
   If you get the chance to have a meal at Buzz, I hope you enjoy what we
   have created there.  I'm hopeful that we can add a bit more excitement
   to the exterior spaces over the next few months as time passes...
   Thank you Margot & Peter for asking me to help you with this wonderful
   project.  I hope it's a fabulous success!

Black & Spiro News

   [blog-shop-oct-2014.png]

   I forgot how great it is to clear the decks!  Our store room is nice
   and spacious again after what seemed like a 2 hour crazy hurricane in
   the shop last Saturday morning at our 1 day sale.  I was very excited
   that almost everything went and since that crazy day, we have been able
   to shape up the shop and give it a bit of a face-lift with some
   beautiful new things.
   Olivia and I were so inspired last Tuesday night that we stayed back
   into the dark hours of the night creating this wonderful wall of tear
   sheets in the store.  It has created much interest and chatter in the
   shop amongst our clients and customers.
   [blog-shop-oct-2013-3.jpg]
   Last Thursday night we opened our 'Flowers' art exhibition.  Divine
   flower paintings line our walls by Pip Boydell, Bridgette McNab, Jenny
   McCown & Linda Sheppard.  If you haven't popped in to see them I invite
   you to do so as they really are so beautiful and they certainly add a
   lovely layer to the store!  The exhibition will run for another 3
   weeks.  I will be sad to see the paintings go!
   [blog-shop-oct-2013-2.jpg]


   [blog-shop-oct-2013-6.jpg]


   Look at these very special new cushions we have in the store made from
   antique textiles.  I am in-love with every single one of them!
   ﻿

   [blog-shop-oct-2013-9.jpg]
   ﻿
   [blog-shop-oct-2013-7.jpg]
   Another new addition in the shop is our beautiful old circa 1920's
   piano.  We encourage anyone who comes in to have a little play if they
   want including your children!  We love having it in the store and we
   are thinking we might have a few Christmas carol Saturday morning
   sessions leading into Christmas!
   In project news, later this week the brand new Buzz restaurant at Gas
   Works will be opening.  We provided the full concept for this new
   restaurant and we are so excited about unveiling it!  I will post some
   pictures here soon I promise!!
   See you soon.

   is next Saturday 12th October but I can't tell you the details about it

   [blog+-+flowers-invite-blackandspiro.jpg]

Shop News

   [blog+-+shop+-september+2013.jpg]
   [blog+-+shop+september+2013.jpg]

   In shop news, late last week we received a rather lovely shipment of
   antiques.  A few divine sideboards, tables and objects.  If you are
   looking for that elusive piece, make sure you pop in as I think our new
   pieces are some of the loveliest we've had in a long time.  We have
   also just had a big delivery of our beautiful Black & Spiro
   bespoke cushions - so many different patterns, shapes and colours to
   choose from.  Some of the cushions we have had made are in the divine,
   unique fabrics I found when I was overseas.

French Leave


   [Blog+-+Anna+1.jpg]
   I thought it appropriate to call this post - 'French Leave' which is
   defined as - an abrupt and unannounced departure (without saying
   farewell).
   Over the course of this year I have kept myself off the streets doing
   my usual decorating thing with some wonderful clients and some exciting
   projects but I have also been heavily engrossed in writing my first
   book with Penguin which is due for release early next year.  I never
   really anticipated the incredible amount of work, energy and
   inspiration needed to write a book and so I felt that in order to
   put all my effort into my writing I really couldn't write a book and a
   blog at the same time.  I hope you can understand my French Leave and
   grant me pardon.  Maybe having my book on your coffee table next year
   will make up for my leave of absence here this year!
   It astonishes me to think that Spring has arrived here in Australia and
   we are on the down-hill slide to Christmas yet again.  Having just
   returned from a much-needed holiday in Europe where we (my family and
   I) experienced and enjoyed the end of Summer there, I am excited to
   think about our forthcoming Summer months.
   I thought you might like to see a few of my holiday snaps which, if you
   follow me on Instagram, you may be a little sick of seeing.  I
   personally love seeing peoples holiday snaps especially of Italy so
   here you go.  I might also post a second series in a few days time.
   Oh and before I depart I will let you know that we have some really
   exciting things happening at Black & Spiro over the next month,
   including a wonderful collaborative art exhibition which I extend you
   an invitation to.  I will post the invite here on the blog and on my
   Instagram in the coming week so watch out for it.  Pip Boydell will be
   showcasing a new series of paintings in a divine new style and we have
   a wonderful Sydney artist, Bridget McNab and 2 other fabulous Brisbane
   artists as well!  We also have another exciting day planned here at the
   store in the coming weeks which I will let you know about closer to the
   date.
   Hope to see you in the shop soon!!

          I established this blog in 2006 so that I could record my
          inspirations, my thoughts and my work as an Interior Designer.
          Based in Brisbane, Australia, my store Black & Spiro is always
          filled with a unique collection of interesting things which we
          scour the globe to find. I am most passionate about my family,
          my career, tradition, collecting, flowers, fabric, gardening,
          colour and quality and I will always strive to be creative and
          extraordinary in everything I do. I hope I can inspire you to
          live a bright and colourful life surrounded by the things you
          love.
