Super Duper Birthday

   [SuperDuperBday3wm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends,
   Today I am sharing a Super Hero themed birthday card I created
   recently.
   While looking through my die stash recently, I discovered Taylored
   Expressions Square Block Cutting Plate that I had apparently purchased
   a few years back and somehow forgotten about and hadn't used. Of course
   I pulled it out so I could make a card using it in the future.
   [SuperDuperBday1wm.jpg]
   Looking through some of my stamps to see what I could use with the die
   I found these fun Super Hero stamps from Sunny Studio Stamps I
   purchased a few months back. I also purchased their Heroic Halftones
   Paper Pad recently, so pulled that out to use for the panels  of the
   frame.
   I like how that smaller rectangle on the right hand side is the perfect
   size for a sentiment.
   [SuperDuperBday2wm.jpg]
   For the inside of my card I created a pop-up card using Karen
   Burniston's Katherine Label Pop-up die set.
   I continued the comic theme that I used on the front of the card on the
   inside. I cut rectangles of black cardstock and rounded the corners and
   then cut out the patterned papers and rounded the end corners and
   adhered this to each side of the card.
   I decorated these panels using a City Block Border and more of the
   stamps from the Sunny Studio Stamps et. I also added a few more
   sentiments from the shapes which are from an MFT Stamps stamp set.
   For the sentiment on the pop-up panel I used a die from Heffy Doodle
   Stamps and the rest is from the Sunny Studio Stamps stamp set.

Santa Ho Ho Ho

   [HoHoHoSanta1wm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends.
   A couple of months ago, I managed to snag a few Christmas themed stamps
   and dies when Simon Says Stamp had one of their Steals & Deals sales.
   Today I am sharing a Christmas card I created using three of the
   products from that sale.
   First up the Santa was made using Simon Says Stamp Picture Book Santa
   die set. I die cut the image using various colored cardstocks and then
   paper pieced it all together.
   The background panel uses Poppy Stamps Pinpoint Snowflake Sidekick
   Frame & Sidekick. I had been eyeing this style of die set for sometime
   so when it was on sale for about 1/2 price I couldn't pass it up. I die
   cut the panel from white cardstock and then added Glitter Dots Peel Off
   Stickers to the centre of the snowflakes.
   I layered this panel to a panel which had been covered using Elizabeth
   Craft Designs Bright Cranberry Silk Microfine Glitter. I added a Merry
   Christmas sentiment to the top left corner of the card.
   [HoHoHoSanta2wm.jpg]
   For the inside of the card I added the sentiment "Ho Ho Ho" using MFT
   Stamps Ho Ho Ho Die-namics. I added another snowflake die cut using the
   frame I used on the front to the centre "Ho" and added some red
   snowflakes which come out of the centre "Ho"

From Our House To Yours

   [OurHouseToYours1wm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends,
   Today I am sharing a Christmas card I created recently using dies from
   Elizabeth Craft Designs.
   This front door scene uses the beautiful Christmas door die set which
   contains the door, trees, lanterns, wreath etc ... everything you see
   on the front to create the front door scene. I just love how beautiful
   and inviting this looks.
   For the base of the card I used MFT Stamps Small Brick Wall Stencil to
   create the walls of the house before adding the door and all the extras
   over the top.
   I wanted to added the sentiment "From Our House To Yours" and I found
   this sentiment from a long retired Waltzing Mouse Stamps stamp set. I
   believe ECD has a similar sentiment included in their "Joyful Wishes"
   stamp set but as I don't have that set I used what was on hand. I have
   linked to the ECD version below in case you are interested.
   I cut everything out of colored cardstock and then sponged around the
   edges using inks that matched the cardstock. I added Warm Diamond Silk
   Microfine Glitter to the ice above and below the door and Clear Nuvo
   Drops to the lanterns and windows in the door.
   [OurHouseToYours2wm.jpg]
   For the inside of the card, I added the tree and presents from the
   Sleigh die set and added the Merry Christmas Small sentiment to the top
   right corner of the card.

Joy, Merry and Bright

   [C4C505Joy3wm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends,
   It’s challenge time with the “Crazies” over on the Crazy 4
   Challenges blog. Being a brand new month it is time to introduce our
   challenge hostess for October which is Tracey Farr.
   For our challenge this week we are to .... Focus on the Sentiment -
   make your sentiment the star of your card, the bigger the better!
   [C4C505Joy1wm.jpg]
   I figured this was a good opportunity to play with my Spellbinders Joy
   die set I purchased a few weeks ago. I die cut the base of
   the sentiment from green cardstock and then cut the letters out using
   Elizabeth Craft Designs Solar Gold Silk Microfine Glitter. I then added
   the flowers and berries using colored cardstocks.
   I used Altenew's Candy Cane Stripe Cover Plate for the background of my
   card, layering this onto red cardstock.
   To finish off the front of my card I added the "Merry and Bright"
   sentiment which is from Holiday Sentiments Glimmer Plate and gold foil.
   [C4C505Joy2wm.jpg]
   For the inside of my card I created a pop-up card using Karen
   Burniston's Katherine Label Pop-up die set. I gold embossed the
   sentiment which is a Penny Black stamp set.
   I added the poinsettia to the upper left corner of the label which was
   created using the poinsettia dies included in Spellbinders Ornament die
   set.
   [C4C505Joy4wm.jpg]
   Along the edges of my card I added the Candy Cane Stripes Cover Plate
   which I die cut from white cardstock and cut in half, adhering half on
   each edge. I then added the Pine Needles Border die which is an older
   die from Memory Box.
   Don't forget to check out the rest of the “Crazies” cards over on
   the Crazy 4 Challenges blog and also their individual blogs for more
   details.

To A Fabulous Teacher

   [BestTeacher3wm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends,
   Today I have a thank you teacher card that I created for my
   grandchildren's teacher. With the end of the school year coming up, I
   need to make sure I have plenty for all the kids teachers.
   [BestTeacher2wm.jpg]
   I created a pop-up card using Karen Burniston's the Katherine Label
   Pop-up die set.
   To decorate the inside of the card I created the school yard scene by
   cutting a blue background panel. I added clouds to the panel using MFT
   Stamps Mini Cloud Stencil and white pigment ink.
   I added grass to the base of my card using Lawn Fawn's Grassy Hillside
   Border die set.
   [BestTeacher4wm.jpg]
   The Build-a-House die set from Lawn Fawn is easy to convert into a
   school house so I added that to the left hand side of the card. I added
   the four characters and accessories images from Tonic Studios Celebrate
   Success stamp set.
   [BestTeacher5wm.jpg]
   The sentiment on the pop up Katherine Label is from Heffy Doodle's
   Teach Me Words stamp set.
   [BestTeacher1wm.jpg]
   For the front of the card I added a blackboard using Hero Arts Wood
   Frames Infinity die set using brown and black cardstock.
   I added the teacher sentiment which is a die cut from Honey Bee Stamps.
   I stamped a few of the small images around the blackboard from the
   Celebrate Success stamp set.  To finish the card I added the globe, set
   square and pencil also from this stamp set.

Sending A Message

   [SendingMessage3wm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends,
   It's challenge time with my friends over on the CCEE Stampers challenge
   blog. It's a brand new month, so it's time to introduce our challenge
   hostess for the month which is Kelly Santi.
   Apparently Today is National Techies Day. I am so grateful to have the
   technology that we do! Create a card with something ‘techy’ on it
   (computers, cell phones, etc) or simply create a thank you card (if
   need be!)

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbTzNzQ8is8?ecver=2

   I decided to go with an "iPhone" theme for our challenge mixing three
   different iPhone/Smart Phone die sets I have and this fun image from
   Art Impressions of two friends texting each other. You can see my card
   in action in the video above.
   [SendingMessage1wm.jpg]
   For the front of my card I used the Art Impressions Texting BFF and
   added a couple of speech bubble messages. The messages are from the
   Marianne Design phone stamp/die set and the speech bubbles are from MFT
   Stamps Smart Phone die-namics which is an older die from my stash.
   [SendingMessage2wm.jpg]
   For the inside of my card I created a pop-up card using Karen
   Burniston's Rockin' Rectangle Pop-up. All the sentiments used on the
   inside are from MFT Stamps Friend Request stamp set.
   [SendingMessage4wm.jpg]
   For the iPhone, I combined all three phone dies. The actual iPhone is
   from Kelly Purkey, I die cut the phone from black for the main part of
   the phone, the inner part from designer paper and then cut a piece a
   silver cardstock slightly larger than the black panel and rounded the
   corners as I wanted a cover on the phone.
   Along the bottom of the iPhone I added some apps which are from the
   Marianne Design Stamp/die set.
   The sentiments are from the MFT Stamps Friend Request stamp set and
   then these were all die cut using the speech bubbles from MFT Stamps
   Smart Phone Die-namics.
   Don't forget to check out the CCEE Stampers blog (goes live 12 AM EST)
   to see the rest of the creations the CCEE Stampers created this week.

Divinity Designs - October Release

   [OctoberReleaseTriowm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends,
   Today I am sharing three projects I created using new stamps and dies
   from Divinity Designs October Release.  For more inspiration using the
   September Release and to see the other designers projects, be sure to
   visit the Divinity Designs Blog.
   There are only 86 days until Christmas, so this month the Divinity
   Designs release is all about Christmas!!!! There are some amazing new
   stamps, dies and papers being released and I am excited to share seven
   of those new products with you today.
   [ChristmasTree1wm.jpg]
   The first thing I pulled out to play with from this release is the
   Christmas Tree Table Top Décor dies ... this is so much fun and perfect
   for Christmas holiday decorations. This Christmas tree stands 10 1/2
   inches with the star in place.
   You need to die cut 4 to 6 Christmas tree to create this decoration.
   The die was a little bigger than I expected, so I was limited in what
   green cardstock I had enough of so opted for this lighter green. After
   die cutting and embossing the tree I then used Eucalyptus Ink to add a
   little more detail to the edges.
   This die set comes with the ornaments & lights to decorate the tree,
   but Divinity Designs has also released a die set with just these in the
   die set in case you want an additional set to make decorating the tree
   a little quicker.
   [ChristmasTree2wm.jpg]
   The Christmas Tree stands on a skirt which was created using the
   Christmas Skirt die.
   No Christmas tree is complete without presents right!!!! so I added
   some presents using the smaller dies from both the Squares and
   Rectangles die sets. To create the presents, I used the dies to die cut
   the patterned paper and then layered this onto a piece of cardstock
   that has a tab at the base, folded the tab, so the present stands up. I
   left mine freestanding, but you could also adhere everything to the
   base. I added the bows which are from the new Treat Tower die set.
   [ChristmasTree3wm.jpg]
   Here is a close up of the Christmas Tree skirt ... this is absolutely
   beautiful with wonderful embossed features. This die is 6 inches in
   diameter. After die cutting and embossing this die, I then adhered it
   to white cardstock and carefully trimmed around the edge.
   [DeerOrnamentHalfShutter1wm.jpg]
   For my second project for today's release I created a Half-Shutter card
   using the Half Shutter Card with Layers die set.
   On the right hand panel I used the ornament from the Deer Ornament
   Stamp/Die Duos set. I gold embossed the ornament and then die cut the
   ornament using the coordinating circle die.
   I used the pine branches from the Pinecone & Pine Branches die set at
   the top of the ornament to resemble a Christmas tree.
   I used one of the sentiments from the stamp set on the centre panel.
   [DeerOrnamentHalfShutter2wm.jpg]
   For the front panel I used the Merry Christmas die set which I die cut
   from Gold Cardstock. I layered this sentiment using the Ovals and
   Scalloped Ovals die sets.
   I added more pine branches to the left hand side of the card, so that
   when the card is closed it looks like a Christmas tree.
   On the lower left hand side of the card I added a deer and tree which
   are from the Trees & Deer die set which is an older die set, but works
   perfectly with many of the products being released this month.
   [DeerOrnamentHalfShutter3wm.jpg]
   The patterned paper used on this card uses the new Rustic Christmas
   Paper Pad.
   [PickupTruckCentreStep1wm.jpg]
   For my final project for today, I created a Center Step Card using the
   Center Step with Layers die set.
   The three panels at the top of the card were die cut using another of
   the papers from the Rustic Christmas Paper Pad.
   Along the bottom of the card I added two layers of snow using the Curvy
   Slopes die set, another older die set.
   [PickupTruckCentreStep2wm.jpg]
   To decorate the front of the card, I used the Pickup Truck die set,
   adding a tree to the back of the truck.
   The trees and deer are again from the Trees & Deer die set.
   I added the star from the Christmas Tree Table Top Décor die set to the
   top right hand side of the card.
   The "Peace" sentiment is from the Deer Ornament Stamp/Die Duos set
   which was die cut using the Sentiment Strips die set.
   [PickupTruckCentreStep3wm.jpg]
   For the inside of my card, I added snow, a tree and dies along the
   bottom of the card.
   I added the "Merry Christmas" sentiment  to the top part of the card
   which is the new Merry Christmas die set.
   Thanks for visiting my blog today, I hope you enjoyed my projects.

Happy Fall

   [HappyFall4wm.jpg]
   Hi Crafty Friends!
   Welcome to our October Karen Burniston Designer Challenge.
   Check out Karen Burniston's blog on Wednesday (US Time) when you will
   be able to see what all the designers created for the challenge this
   month, plus Karen will have an amazing video tutorial to share with us
   all.
   Our challenge theme this month is .... "AUTUMN" - use our autumn dies
   (Elements and/or Word Set 7) for a card celebrating fall.
   [HappyFall3wm.jpg]
   For my card today I decided to pull out Karen's Photo Collage Pop-up
   die set to showcase the leaves and other elements included in the
   Autumn Elements die set.
   I created my background panels using Gina K Designs Leafy Stencil
   sponging on Distress Oxide inks in fall/autumn colors.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/haiOKm23g4A?ecver=2

   Here is a quick video to see my card in action.
   I die cut all the leaves, pumpkin, apples and acorn from white
   cardstock and then colored each of them using Distress Oxides.
   I added the "Fall, Autumn & Colors" words from the Word Set 7 - Autumn
   Greetings die set to three of the photo frames. I also added the
   bulldog clips three of the frames too.
   [HappyFall2wm.jpg]
   I added squares from the Crosshatch - Squares die set to the top left
   and bottom right hand corners to the card.
   The bear, mice, tree trunk and stamp sentiment are from Neat &
   Tangled/Simon Says Stamps stamp set.
   [HappyFall1wm.jpg]
   I kept the front fairly simple seeing the focus is on the inside of the
   card. I added the Happy Fall using the Happy from the Word Set 7 -
   Autumn Greetings and the Alphabet die set for the word "Fall" The
   sentiment was layered using circles from the Crosshatch - Circles die
   set.
   I finished off the card adding a few leaves to the card.
   [HappyFall5wm.jpg]
   Here is one last photo of my card when it is partially closed. It does
   fold pretty flat and will fit inside a standard envelope.
   Don't forget to visit Karen Burniston's blog on Wednesday when you will
   be able to see what all the designers created for the challenge this
   month.

          Hi I am a stamper from 'downunder' Australia. I have been
          married to my wonderfully supportive husband for about 45 years.
          I have 2 beautiful adult daughters,and two adorable
          Grandchildren .. a boy and a girl :)! I also have one very
          spoilt dog who thinks she is in charge of the house. My name
          StampOwl is not because of any late night stamping sessions
          (although I have been known to do that at times), but rather it
          combines my two favourite hobbies - stamping & collecting owls.
          If it is a choice between the two stamping normally wins!
