Introducing SketchCassette

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ya-RIAWIbA

   Elliott Smith. Bruce Springsteen. Iron & Wine. Daniel Johnston. Wu-Tang
   Clan. All these artists have at one point in their career, either by
   choice or necessity, made use of a 4-track cassette recorder to capture
   their music. There is a sound to these cassette recordings that people
   tend to refer to in vague, almost mystical terms, speaking of warmth,
   intimacy, even fragility.

   We too have always loved the sound of songs recorded on 4-track tape,
   so when it came time to start work on our senior design project at our
   university, we decided to combine our love of DSP programming and
   cassettes into what became SketchCassette. The goal was to make a tape
   plugin that did what the current offerings don’t: allow the user to
   recreate all the messed up things that one can get when a tape doesn’t
   behave.
   Our GUI, designed by Dan, is a visual reflection of SketchCassette’s
   lo-fi sonic aesthetics

   We believe that we have managed to isolate, quantify, and recreate some
   of the most special sounds that cassettes can produce and package them
   digitally with deep user control. This includes everything from clean
   high fidelity performance with subtle filtering and saturation to total
   tape catastrophe and beyond. SketchCassette, despite being first and
   foremost a lo-fi tape plugin, is endlessly versatile and well suited on
   a huge variety of source material.

   SketchCassette includes the following features modeled from real, new
   old stock cassettes:
     * Age modeling
     * Saturation
     * Wow & flutter with sine and random wave modulation options
     * Deeply controllable dropouts
     * Accurate, stereo tape hiss
     * Tape type frequency profiles
          + Type I: 1985 TDK D90
          + Type II: 1986 BASF Chromdioxid ii
          + Type IV (Metal): 1988 Sony Metal-SR
     * Noise-reduction encoding compression

About

   Here at Aberrant we create exciting, affordable tools for creative
   mixing and audio production. Our goal is to offer you various ways of
   introducing color, intrigue, and personality into your mixes, and help
   you achieve a refreshing and engaging sound. We believe that the mixing
   and production stages of making music are important parts of the
   creative process, and the tools you use should ignite a spark for new
   ideas and innovation, rather than simply guide you toward a clean,
   polished mix.

   Our way of meeting that goal is by creating plugins that offer up
   sounds that are uncommon in today’s digital audio workflows. We are
   always trying to find new ways to tweak the formulas that people have
   come to expect from common effects by introducing glitches,
   modulations, and misbehaviors that are all deeply user controllable.

   If you want something strange, exciting, and entirely different in your
   mixes, you’ve come to the right place.
