Two editors for each job

   [2-editors.png]

   English correction is not a skill that just any native speaker can
   carry out. Our English correction service is provided by professional,
   highly experienced editors. We recruit editors who have years of
   experience of English editing and English proofreading work. Once
   corrected by our teams, the English in your edited document will flow
   as if written by a native English speaker.
   Introduce me to your professional editors.

Our focus on quality

   The fact that our English editing services are provided online means
   that we can easily allocate a native English editor and a second
   proofreader to edit then check every document we handle. Quality is
   built into every phase of our English correction service and having a
   two-tier editing/proofreading service ensures you receive a faultless
   document.
   Read why this double-checking was coded into our workflow.
