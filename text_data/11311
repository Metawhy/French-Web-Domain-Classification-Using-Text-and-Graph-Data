   Precompiled binary distributions of the base system and contributed
   packages, Windows and Mac users most likely want one of these versions
   of R:

     * Download R for Windows

   R is part of many Linux distributions, you should check with your Linux
   package management system in addition to the link above.

Source Code for all Platforms

   Windows and Mac users most likely want to download the precompiled
   binaries listed in the upper box, not the source code. The sources have
   to be compiled before you can use them. If you do not know what this
   means, you probably do not want to do it!
     * The latest release (2019-07-05, Action of the Toes) R-3.6.1.tar.gz,
       read what's new in the latest version.
     * Sources of R alpha and beta releases (daily snapshots, created only
       in time periods before a planned release).
     * Daily snapshots of current patched and development versions are
       available here. Please read about new features and bug fixes before
       filing corresponding feature requests or bug reports.
     * Source code of older versions of R is available here.
     * Contributed extension packages

Questions About R

     * If you have questions about R like how to download and install the
       software, or what the license terms are, please read our answers to
       frequently asked questions before you send an email.

What are R and CRAN?

   R is ‘GNU S’, a freely available language and environment for
   statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of
   statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling,
   statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering,
   etc. Please consult the R project homepage for further information.

   CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store
   identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. Please
   use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load.

   To “submit” a package to CRAN, check that your submission meets the
   CRAN Repository Policy and then use the web form.

   If this fails, upload to ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/ and send an

   mailboxes of half a dozen people.

   Note that we generally do not accept submissions of precompiled
