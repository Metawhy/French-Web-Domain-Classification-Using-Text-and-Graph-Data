Overview

   Cameroon Forest

   Forests play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they
   soak up carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that would otherwise
   be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in climate
   patterns.

   Forests are essential for life on earth. Three hundred million people
   worldwide live in forests and 1.6 billion depend on them for their
   livelihoods. Forests also provide habitat for a vast array of plants
   and animals, many of which are still undiscovered. They protect our
   watersheds. They inspire wonder and provide places for recreation. They
   supply the oxygen we need to survive. They provide the timber for
   products we use every day.

   Forests are so much more than a collection of trees. Forests are home
   to 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity. These ecosystems are
   complex webs of organisms that include plants, animals, fungi and
   bacteria. Forests take many forms, depending on their latitude, local
   soil, rainfall and prevailing temperatures. Coniferous forests are
   dominated by cone-bearing trees, like pines and firs that can thrive in
   northern latitudes where these forests are often found. Many temperate
   forests house both coniferous and broad-leafed trees, such as oaks and
   elms, which can turn beautiful shades of orange, yellow and red in the
   fall.

   The most biologically diverse and complex forests on earth are tropical
   rainforests, where rainfall is abundant and temperatures are always
   warm. Forests also play a critical role in mitigating climate change
   because they act as a carbon sink—soaking up carbon dioxide and other
   greenhouse gases that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and
   contribute to ongoing changes in climate patterns.

   But forests are being destroyed and degraded at alarming rates.
   Deforestation comes in many forms, including fires, clear-cutting for
   agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for
   timber, and degradation due to climate change. This impacts people’s
   livelihoods and threatens a wide range of plant and animal
   species. Forests are disappearing at an alarming rate—18.7 million
   acres of forests are lost annually, equivalent to 27 soccer fields
   every minute.

   The Amazon, the planet’s largest rainforest, lost at least 17% of its
   forest cover in the last half century due to human activity. In
   Indonesia, the island of Sumatra has lost 85% of its forests—primarily
   due to conversion for oil palm and pulp plantations—and a similar level
   of destruction is taking place on the island of Borneo. Deforestation
   also undermines the important carbon sink function of forests. It is
   estimated that 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions are the result of
   deforestation.

Collaborating to Conserve Forests: HP and WWF Project Goes Beyond Responsible
Sourcing Toward a Healthier Planet

   Our forests are in crisis. Nearly half of all global forests are under
   threat of deforestation and forest degradation, which represents a
   major risk to global climate, biodiversity, water, people, and
   businesses who depend on healthy forests. HP is one company that’s
   responding to this need for action.

Why They Matter

     * Forest

People Depend on Forests
       Millions of people around the world depend on forests for hunting,
       gathering and medicine, forest products such as rubber and rattan,
       and small-scale agriculture. Deforestation can disrupt the lives of
       local communities, sometimes with devastating consequences. Forests
       provide a vast array of resources to all of us, including food,
       wood, medicine, fresh water, and the air we breathe. Without the
       trees, species can disappear, the natural water balance can become
       disrupted and the ecosystem that supports the human population can
       fall apart.

Carbon Sink
       Forest trees and other plants soak up carbon dioxide from the
       atmosphere and store it away as they grow and thrive. Tropical
       forests alone hold more than 210 gigatons of carbon, seven times
       the amount emitted each year by human activities.
     * Chimpanzee

Unique Biodiversity
       Eighty percent of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal
       species can be found in forests, and tropical rainforests are home
       to more species than any other terrestrial habitat. A square
       kilometer of forest may be home to more than 1,000 species.

Threats

Conversion to Agriculture

   As the human population continues to grow, there is an obvious need for
   more food. In addition, agricultural products, such as soy and palm
   oil, are used in an ever-increasing list of products, from animal feed
   to lipstick and biofuels. Rising demand has created incentives to
   convert forests to farmland and pasture land. Once a forest is lost to
   agriculture, it is usually gone forever—along with many of the plants
   and animals that once lived there.

Illegal Logging

   Illegal logging Riau, Sumatra

   Illegal logging in Sumatra.

   National laws regulate the production and trade of timber products at
   all stages, from harvesting to processing to sales. These laws can be
   violated in any number of ways, such as taking wood from protected
   areas, harvesting more than is permitted and harvesting protected
   species. Illegal logging occurs around the world, and in some places,
   illegal logging is more common than the legal variety. This destruction
   threatens some of the world’s most famous and valuable forests,
   including rainforests in the Amazon, Congo Basin, Indonesia and the
   forests of the Russian Far East. Illegal logging also depresses the
   price of timber worldwide, disadvantaging law-abiding companies, and
   depriving governments of revenues normally generated by duties and
   taxes. Poor communities near forests are often vulnerable when
   outsiders try to gain control over the timber nearby, which can lead to
   repression and human rights violations.

Fires

   Forest Fire, Amazon

    Fires are a natural and beneficial part of the forest landscape, but
   they can be a problem when they occur in the wrong place, at the wrong
   frequency or at the wrong severity. Each year, millions of acres of
   forest around the world are destroyed or degraded by fire. The same
   amount is lost to logging and agriculture combined. Fire is often used
   as a way to efficiently and inexpensively clear land for other uses
   such as planting crops. These fires not only alter the structure and
   composition of forests, but they can also open up the forests to
   invasive species, threaten biological diversity, alter water cycles and
   soil fertility, and destroy the livelihoods of the people who live in
   and around the forests.

Fuelwood Harvesting

   Wood is still a popular fuel choice for cooking and heating around the
   world, and about half of the illegal removal of timber from forests is
   thought to be for use as fuelwood.

What WWF Is Doing

   Mountain Gorilla

   WWF works to create protected areas, which have been key to the
   preservation of some species, such as the mountain gorillas that live
   in the forests of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa.

Working with Companies

   To combat illegal logging and promote responsible forestry, WWF created
   the Global Forest & Trade Network (GFTN). GFTN links hundreds of
   companies, forest-dependent communities, non-governmental organizations
   and entrepreneurs in more than 30 countries around the world with the
   goal of creating a market for environmentally responsible forest
   products. GFTN works at national and regional levels to expand the area
   of forests under responsible and credibly certified forest management.
   It also works to encourage demand for “good wood” – wood and paper
   products from those well-managed forests. GFTN helps participants
   benefit from sustainable forest management and reduce demand for
   products from illegal and controversial sources. As a result of this
   program, habitat has been preserved for endangered species such as the
   Borneo pygmy elephant, orangutan and great apes.
   GFTN legally harvested timber

   WWF's Global Forest Trade Network (GFTN) works at national and regional
   levels to ensure the legal harvest of timber. Here, a man marks legally
   harvested timber.

Working to Reduce Deforestation

   Eliminating all deforestation is not possible. Parts of the landscape
   will need to be reshaped and altered as populations grow and change—but
   this can be balanced through sustainable forest management,
   reforestation efforts, and maintaining the integrity of protected
   areas. Given the amount of deforestation around the world, zero net
   deforestation may seem unattainable. However, it is not only possible,
   but necessary if we intend to preserve our most precious wildlife,
   respect and empower local communities, maintain critical ecosystem
   services and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some nations are already
   finding success. Paraguay, for example, reduced the rate of
   deforestation in their country by 85% in the years just following
   enactment of its 2004 Zero Deforestation Law. WWF advocates for
   governments, international bodies and other stakeholders to make zero
   net deforestation a reality by 2020.

Offsetting Carbon Emissions from Forests

   If carbon emissions from deforestation were taken into account, Brazil
   and Indonesia would rank in the top 10 of the world’s worst polluters.
   WWF has a program focus on reducing emissions from deforestation and
   forest degradation in developing countries and the conservation,
   sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon
   stocks (called REDD+). These efforts will also address many of the
   drivers of deforestation and provide incentives for nations to protect
   their forests while safeguarding the rights of local communities and
   indigenous peoples.

Creating Protected Areas

   Securing forest ecosystems as parks and other protected areas can help
   to preserve their valuable plants and animals for future generations.
   Protected areas have proved key to the preservation of some species,
   such as the mountain gorillas that live in the forests of the Virunga
   Mountains in East Africa. In addition to protecting biodiversity, the
   Amazon Region Protected Areas program has demonstrated that a system of
   well-managed and sustainably-financed protected areas contributes to
   reduced CO2 emissions from deforestation. WWF has worked to create and
   continue support for protected areas in more than 100 countries around
   the world.

Promoting Sustainable Bioenergy

   Biomass

   Biomass from forestry and farming has the potential to become a major
   source for sustainable power generation.

   Humans have used forests for fuel for thousands of years, and 2.6
   billion people today still use biomass—mainly wood and charcoal—for
   cooking. WWF works to promote bioenergy from scrap wood, oil and fats,
   sugar and starch crops, residues and wastes, and even algae to reduce
   reliance on forests and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. WWF’s vision
   is that by 2050, 100% of the world’s energy will come from sustainable,
   renewable sources, including bioenergy.

Stopping Illegal Logging

   Illegal logging includes the harvesting, transporting, processing,
   buying or selling of timber in violation of national laws. WWF uses
   several approaches to tackle illegal logging. One is ensuring that
   powerful policies and trade agreements are in place in the US and other
   countries. WWF also provides guidance on best practices related to
   legality and responsible sourcing to hundreds of companies around the
   world, including in the US, and supports an alliance that monitors the
   status of the remaining natural forests in Sumatra's province of Riau.
   We, too, we encourage US consumers to buy wood products that are
   certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.

Overview

   Soil erosion in Kenya

   Soil is the earth’s fragile skin that anchors all life on Earth. It is
   comprised of countless species that create a dynamic and complex
   ecosystem and is among the most precious resources to humans. Increased
   demand for agriculture commodities generates incentives to convert
   forests and grasslands to farm fields and pastures. The transition to
   agriculture from natural vegetation often cannot hold onto the soil and
   many of these plants, such as coffee, cotton, palm oil, soybean and
   wheat, can actually increase soil erosion beyond the soil’s ability to
   maintain itself.

   Half of the topsoil on the planet has been lost in the last 150 years.
   In addition to erosion, soil quality is affected by other aspects of
   agriculture. These impacts include compaction, loss of soil structure,
   nutrient degradation, and soil salinity. These are very real and at
   times severe issues.

   The effects of soil erosion go beyond the loss of fertile land. It has
   led to increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers,
   clogging these waterways and causing declines in fish and other
   species. And degraded lands are also often less able to hold onto
   water, which can worsen flooding. Sustainable land use can help to
   reduce the impacts of agriculture and livestock, preventing soil
   degradation and erosion and the loss of valuable land to
   desertification.

   The health of soil is a primary concern to farmers and the global
   community whose livelihoods depend on well managed agriculture that
   starts with the dirt beneath our feet. While there are many challenges
   to maintaining healthy soil, there are also solutions and a dedicated
   group of people, including WWF, who work to innovate and maintain the
   fragile skin from which biodiversity springs.

Causes

   Guidelines to avoid overgrazing

   Working on providing guidelines for local herders to avoid overgrazing.

   As the human population has expanded, more and more land has been
   cleared for agriculture and other pursuits that degrade the soil and
   make erosion more likely to occur.

Agriculture

   When agriculture fields replace natural vegetation, topsoil is exposed
   and can dry out. The diversity and quantity of microorganisms that help
   to keep the soil fertile can decrease, and nutrients may wash out. Soil
   can be blown away by the winds or washed away by rains.

Deforestation

   Without plant cover, erosion can occur and sweep the land into rivers.
   The agricultural plants that often replace the trees cannot hold onto
   the soil and many of these plants, such as coffee, cotton, palm oil,
   soybean and wheat, can actually worsen soil erosion. And as land loses
   its fertile soil, agricultural producers move on, clear more forest and
   continue the cycle of soil loss.

Overgrazing

   The conversion of natural ecosystems to pasture land doesn’t damage the
   land initially as much as crop production, but this change in usage can
   lead to high rates of erosion and loss of topsoil and nutrients.
   Overgrazing can reduce ground cover, enabling erosion and compaction of
   the land by wind and rain.. This reduces the ability for plants to grow
   and water to penetrate, which harms soil microbes and results in
   serious erosion of the land.

Use of Agrochemicals

   Pesticides and other chemicals used on crop plants have helped farmers
   to increase yields. Scientists have found that overuse of some of these
   chemicals changes soil composition and disrupts the balance of
   microorganisms in the soil. This stimulates the growth of harmful
   bacteria at the expense of beneficial kinds.

Impacts

   Repairing land that is vulnerable to erosion

   Crops like napier grass are good for soil retention, regeneration and
   fodder use.

   The loss of fertile soil makes land less productive for agriculture,
   creates new deserts, pollutes waterways and can alter how water flows
   through the landscape, potentially making flooding more common.

Desertification

   Desertification can be characterized by the droughts and arid
   conditions the landscape endures as a result of human exploitation of
   fragile ecosystems. Effects include land degradation, soil erosion and
   sterility, and a loss of biodiversity, with huge economic costs for
   nations where deserts are growing.

Loss of Arable Land

   Arable land is any land that can be used to grow crops. Many of the
   practices used in growing those crops can lead to the loss of topsoil
   and destruction of soil characteristics that make agriculture possible.

Clogged and Polluted Waterways

   Soil eroded from the land, along with pesticides and fertilizers
   applied to fields, washes into streams and waterways. This
   sedimentation and pollution can damage freshwater and marine habitats
   and the local communities that depend on them.

Increased Flooding

   Land is often transformed from a forest or other natural landscape,
   such as floodplains and wetlands, into a crop field or pasture. The
   converted land is less able to soak up water, making flooding more
   common. There are methods to improve soil water holding capacity as
   well as restoration and maintenance of wetlands.

What WWF Is Doing

   Soil erosion measurement stick

   As a growing human population cuts down forests and transforms natural
   landscapes into fields for agricultural crops and pasture land, the
   sustainable use of the world’s natural resources is becoming
   increasingly important.

Promoting Sustainable Agriculture

   Agriculture gives us food, fiber, and even biofuels. Farming is the
   world’s largest industry, employing a billion people who produce more
   than $1 trillion of food annually. WWF works with farmers, major
   companies and their supply chains to promote the use and development of
   sustainable agriculture that preserves and restores critical habitats,
   helps protect watersheds and improves the health of soil and water.

Working to Reduce Deforestation

   Eliminating all deforestation is not possible. Parts of the landscape
   will need to be reshaped and altered as populations grow and change—but
   this can be balanced through sustainable forest management,
   reforestation efforts and maintaining the integrity of protected areas.
   Given the amount of deforestation around the world, zero net
   deforestation may seem unattainable. However, it is not only possible,
   but necessary if we intend to preserve our most precious wildlife,
   respect and empower local communities, maintain critical ecosystem
   services and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some nations are already
   finding success. Paraguay reduced the rate of deforestation in their
   country by 85% in the years just following enactment of its 2004 Zero
   Deforestation Law. WWF advocates for governments, international bodies
   and other stakeholders to make zero net deforestation a reality by
   2020.

Preventing Desert Expansion

   To prevent desert expansion, WWF works to preserve and restore
   ecosystems in danger of desertification. For example, in the
   Mediterranean, WWF developed a program to create a network of protected
   forests to integrate conservation and development so that local people
   would benefit from their natural heritage.

Overview

25%

   of global land use, land-use change and forestry emissions are driven
   by beef production, including conversion of forests in the Brazilian
   Amazon.

   Beef is raised in many of the most sensitive and important ecosystems
   around the world, including the North America’s great plains, the
   Brazilian Amazon, the savannahs of Southern Africa and the Great
   Barrier Reef watershed of Australia.

   With the global population expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050 and
   income levels rising, demand for beef is increasing and will only grow.
   Yet beef production requires a lot of land, water and energy, and
   generates considerable waste. It is thus essential to improve its
   sustainability globally.

   There are many ways beef production—when sustainably managed—can
   achieve conservation benefits. Grazing maintains the health of
   grasslands, improves soil quality with manure, and preserves open space
   and wildlife habitat. Additionally, carbon is sequestered in the
   grasses and soils of grazing lands. Beef production also provides
   social benefits by sustaining livelihoods and community vibrancy in
   rural areas where grasslands dominate. In the Northern Great Plains,
   for example, WWF is partnering with ranchers, recognizing that their
   viability is key to keeping grasslands intact. When ranchers manage
   land for long-term health, wildlife and people, everyone wins.

   WWF envisions a global marketplace in which all beef is sustainable. By
   working with producers as well as companies and their supply chains to
   improve the sustainability of beef production, WWF is helping ensure
   that consumers have choices for a safe, affordable and sustainable
   diet.

The story of soy

   Behind beef, soy is the second largest agricultural driver of
   deforestation worldwide. From the Northern Great Plains of the U.S. to
   the Amazon of Brazil, forests, grasslands, and wetlands are being
   plowed up to make room for more soy production.

Impacts

   Beef production has several distinct and significant impacts on the
   environment. More agricultural land is used to raise cattle than all
   other domesticated animals and crops combined. In addition, cattle eat
   an increasing proportion of grain produced from agriculture, are one of
   the most significant contributors to water pollution and soil
   degradation, and are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.
   Finally, processing cattle into meat, meat by-products and leather is a
   major source of pollution in many countries.

Habitat conversion

   Researchers estimate that each year an area of rainforest larger than
   the state of New York is destroyed to create grazing land. Other
   important habitats, such as the grasslands of the Northern Great
   Plains, are threatened by expansion of crops for livestock and human
   consumption. Currently, over two-thirds of the world's agricultural
   land is used for maintaining livestock. One-third of the world's land
   is suffering desertification due in large part to deforestation,
   overgrazing and poor agricultural practices.
   Cattle ranching and forest burning

Water pollution and usage

   Disposal of cattle production waste without proper treatment leads to
   the pollution of water resources. Sediment resulting from poor grazing
   management contaminates surface water and groundwater. Beef production
   also requires a significant amount of water, most of which is used to
   grow feed for cattle.

Industrial pollution

   As the global cattle industry has expanded, the beef slaughter and
   leather industries have grown vigorously. When it is not properly
   treated, waste from slaughterhouses and tanneries—rich in organic
   matter, heavy metals and caustic solutions—is highly polluting without
   appropriate treatment.

Soil degradation

   Livestock farming is one of the main contributors to soil erosion
   around the world. Turning forests into pasture and overgrazing, or
   using marginal lands to grow feed, can lead to extreme loss of topsoil
   and organic matter that may take decades or centuries to replace.

Climate change

   Beef production has a considerable effect on climate change due to
   emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and carbon
   dioxide. Research shows that ruminant livestock account for between 7%
   and 18% of global methane emissions from human-related activities.

What WWF Is Doing

   Cattle

   WWF is committed to working with the global beef industry to address
   production issues in ways that are socially responsible,
   environmentally sustainable and economically viable.

Improving Management Practices

   Initial research shows that there are a number of best management
   practices that, if adopted broadly, can measurably reduce environmental
   impacts. These include:
     * Maintaining vegetative cover
     * Avoiding overgrazing
     * Protecting riparian areas
     * Selecting for cattle that are more efficient
     * Reducing waste and disposing of waste in the least harmful ways
     * Using chemicals and antibiotics judiciously
     * Reducing wastewater
     * Improving water effluent quality
     * Reducing soil compaction

Catalyzing Global Action on Beef

   WWF’s first major initiative related to this work was helping to
   convene the Global Conference on Sustainable Beef, held in November
   2010. Approximately 300 stakeholders from across the beef system met to
   address the environmental, economic and social impacts of beef
   production and determine if there was consensus for forming a coalition
   to improve the sustainability of the global beef system.

   The message was loud and clear: a multi-stakeholder initiative was
   needed and with that, a foundation for the Global Roundtable for
   Sustainable Beef (GRSB) was laid. WWF is a founding member of the GRSB,
   which formally launched in February 2012. It overwhelmingly approved
   global principles and criteria in November 2014, and WWF is actively
   involved in the newly established U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef
   and Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef as well as related pilot
   projects to develop key sustainability indicators and methods to verify
   sustainable beef. Other national roundtables have been created in
   Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, with more to come.

Promoting Sustainable Ranching

   Through the Sustainable Ranching Initiative, WWF collaborates with
   farmers and ranchers around the world to identify and accelerate the
   use of more ecologically and economically sustainable management
   practices. The Initiative is working in key beef production areas such
   as the Northern Great Plains, the Chihuahua Desert, Australia,
   Argentina, and southern Africa to increase the uptake of best
   practices.

Florida Ranchlands Environmental Services Project (FRESP)

   In the Northern Everglades region of Florida, WWF worked with ranchers
   to establish the Florida Ranchlands Environmental Services Project
   (FRESP) in 2005. This collaborative, entrepreneurial endeavor designed
   a “payment for environmental services” approach to improving water
   retention and reducing nutrient loads on ranchlands. FRESP is now
   coming to a close after successfully informing the launch of the
   Northern Everglades-Payment for Environmental Services project of the
   South Florida Water Management District.

Food Waste

Overview

   food waste

45%

   About 45% of all fruits, vegetables, roots, and tubers are wasted

   We now produce enough food for everyone on the planet today. But we’re
   losing millions of acres of native grassland in the US to agriculture
   in areas like the Northern Great Plains. Producing enough food while
   limiting our impact on the environment is one of the biggest challenges
   of our time.

   That is why an effective food strategy must address the issue of food
   loss and waste. In order to meet global food security needs, as well as
   the food demands of an increasingly affluent global population, we will
   need to both increase productivity and efficiency as well as reduce
   food waste.

   Worldwide, humans waste one of every three food calories produced.
   These wasted calories are enough to feed three billion people—10 times
   the population of the United States, more than twice that of China, and
   more than three times the total number of malnourished globally. Wasted
   food represents about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and is a
   main contributor to deforestation and the depletion of global water
   sources.

   This makes reducing waste a huge opportunity. WWF is now bringing
   people together from the hospitality industry, retail, and food
   services sectors, as well as schools and farms to explore how to
   measure and reduce waste from field to table.

   If you or your business is interested in innovative, new approaches to
   reducing food loss and waste, Further With Food, is a great resource
   for all of us to learn from each other and contribute to cutting food
   loss and waste in the US in half by 2030.

A wake-up call on agriculture’s role in climate change

   The connection between food and land use and global climate change is
   the subject of a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations body that assesses the science
   of climate change for the benefit of global policymakers. IPCC’s August
   2019 report focuses especially on the impact of agriculture—with good
   reason.

Why It Matters

     * watering a field

       Every living creature depends on healthy and abundant fresh water
       for survival. But each year, more than 66 trillion gallons of water
       go toward producing food that’s lost or wasted. We can change this
       by producing and eating only the food we need.
     * ranchers and cattle

       Livestock require a lot of land and water in many of the most
       sensitive ecosystems around the world—from the Northern Great
       Plains of the United States to the savannahs of southern Africa.
       Yet about 20% of these products are wasted, which means we’re
       wasting one-fifth of the land and water used to produce them.
     * fruits and vegetables

       Fruits and vegetables are great sources of nutrition, yet they’re
       also among the most wasted foods. About 45% of all fruits,
       vegetables, roots, and tubers are wasted, according to the Food and
       Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That’s the
       equivalent of 3.7 trillion apples and 1 billion bags of potatoes.
     * farm land

       By building an efficient food system that reduces waste, we can
       help save the land, water, and energy upon which people and
       wildlife depend. More than 5.4 million square miles of land—an
       expanse greater than the US, India, and Mexico combined—are used to
       produce food that’s wasted. This impacts the natural habitat of
       many wild animals, the fresh water we share with them, and the
       global climate.
     * garbage trucks headed to landfill

       Around the world, people are facing more extreme weather linked to
       climate change. Food waste contributes to this threat. Food sent to
       landfills produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that impacts
       our climate. Each year, wasted food emits more than 3.3 billion
       tons of these gases.
     * food stocked in a warehouse

       A smooth and functional supply chain that brings food from farms to
       our tables is necessary to feed the world. Yet, right now, we lose
       and waste food at every link in this chain. Developing countries
       tend to lose more food on farms and in transportation where roads
       and refrigeration are lacking. In developed countries, we waste
       food more often in grocery stores, restaurants, and our own homes.
     * family eating

       Food brings family and friends together in all parts of the globe.
       We need to think about our choices in restaurants and grocery
       stores and at home to ensure these gatherings are also good for the
       environment.

What WWF Is Doing

   A farm

Markets Institute

   As part of WWF’s Markets Institute, the food waste program is working
   to convene key stakeholders across hospitality, retail, and food
   services sectors to understand how to accelerate the adoption of
   strategies to measure and reduce food waste. We are also promoting data
   transparency, which will allow companies to benchmark food waste
   prevention performance with their peers and across industries.

Transforming Business

   WWF is building on the success of its ongoing work with market leaders
   to increase adoption of food waste reduction programs, working to
   transform sectors where we see potential for the greatest impact. Our
   initial focus is measurement—establishing baselines and setting goals:
   we must first understand industry metrics today before we can determine
   the roadmap for success tomorrow.

   WWF is working across the spectrum—from food producers to consumers and
   many others in between—to recapture food’s lost value from farm to
   cafeteria to dining room.
   Hotels, which serve $35 billion dollars in catering and banquets each
   year in the US, are an ideal test bed to learn, iterate, drive waste
   reduction, and help reshape the food service industry.

   WWF, in partnership with the American Hotel and Lodging Association
   (AHLA) and with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, engaged the
   hospitality industry in research and demonstration projects across the
   country to test food waste prevention strategies, understand the
   largest drivers of food waste, and determine the most effective staff,
   leadership, and customer engagement strategies to inform an industry
   best practices campaign.
   Out of these projects came a toolkit to provide the industry with
   strategies, tips, and resources to prevent waste from occurring at
   their properties, donate what cannot be prevented but is still safe to
   eat, and divert what remains from landfills. Learn more at
   HotelKitchen.org.

Maximizing Farm Resources

   Lettuce growing on a farm

   WWF, in partnership with UC Davis and the Global Cold Chain Alliance
   (GCCA), recently launched an effort to determine how much food could be
   better utilized on farm and post-harvest. The goal is to better
   understand the amount and causes of edible and inedible produce that’s
   currently excluded from the value chain. WWF will form baseline
   measurements for losses and use the WRI Food Loss and Waste
   Standard for reporting results. Our effort seeks to improve the way
   products are grown and sold and increase profits for farmers by finding
   markets and solutions that maximize farm resources and edible food
   rescue.

Saving School Food

   WWF is working with students and teachers, grades 5-12, to share the
   value of food and strategies for reducing waste. Schools can use their
   cafeteria as a classroom to conduct food waste audits and understand
   the connection between their food, wildlife, and habitat conservation.
   We aim to promote more sustainable and economical food procurement and
   service strategies in schools, and to build a culture of respect for
   food that can help students forge lifelong stewardship habits. Learn
   more about how your students or school can become Food Waste Warriors.
