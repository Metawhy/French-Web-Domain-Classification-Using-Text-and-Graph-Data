   answers to these common issues.

   We also have a huge library of Frequently Asked Gardening Questions, as
   well as a Dictionary of Garden Terms. Need something to listen to?

   Podcast, also available on itunes.

   Beyond all that, we also have thousands of articles, nicely categorized
   to help you find what you're looking for.

   variety of printed gardening books.
   Research Plants

   Our database of plants has been in continuous development since 2010,
   and now has over 700K plants and nearly half a million photos. Any
   member of NGA is allowed to contribute to it, and it has had many
   thousands of different gardeners collaborating in its development. We
   have a team of administrators and moderators who check each and every
   addition, helping to ensure accuracy at all times.

   Every day new plants and photos are added by our members.

   Each plant has all the important data details included, such as
   sunlight requirements, water needs, etc. For each plant, members can
   post photos, write comments, and enter in grower performance reports.
   For cultivars, we track parentage and allow gardeners to easily
   traverse family trees to see which pollen or pod parent each cultivar
   was bred from. We also have custom data fields for different kinds of
   plants. Tomatoes, for example, include data fields for heredity, fruit
   shape, etc.

   Members can keep their own custom lists of plants that they grow (or
   wish to grow in the future). They can then use this list as a journal
   where they report milestones in the growth of all their plants. These
   lists also form the backbone of the world's largest seed swap that
   occurs each fall, when tens of thousands of seed packets are shared
   amongst the NGA membership.

   We also maintain beautifully designed plant care guides for each the
   main kinds of plants.
   Gardening Tools
   [smallmap-460.gif] We maintain a number of highly popular tools that
   gardeners can use to find important and helpful information for their
   gardening activities. They are all easy to use and need only a zipcode
   to return insights relevant to your local area.

   Our most popular tool is the Planting Calendar. Enter your zipcode and
   it will tell you exactly when you should plant all the common kinds of
   vegetables. Similarly, enter your zipcode to know when you can expect
   your first and last frost dates for your area. You can lookup your USDA
   Hardiness Zone, and browse our Calendar of Local Gardening Events. To
   help you calculate how much mulch, fertilizer, or other gardening
   inputs, use our handy Gardening Calculators.
