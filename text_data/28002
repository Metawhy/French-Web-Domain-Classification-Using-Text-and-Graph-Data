   Are you considered a night owl or early bird when it comes to personal
   productivity?
   Are you considered a night owl or early bird when focusing on your
   personal projects, especially for those of you with traditional 9-to-5
   workday jobs? There are those who are exhausted into the office every
   morning, while the early bird finds bursts of energy much earlier on
   For me I'm a special breed...overall I'm a night owl during the
   weeknights, and typically loves to be early riser on the weekends
   feeling there's a whole day ahead of me. That speaks to when I'll be
   online at Product Hunt as well. What about you?

   For me I'm a special breed...I'm notorious for midnight hooting and
   working away on my artwork during the weeknights, and wakes up earlier
   than my pet lovebird Goldie during the weekends and holidays. Am I the
   abnormal one here or are there others who functions like I do as well?

   I love my AirPods and don't feel a need for these in every day usage.
   But I'd be tempted to get them for when I want to go for a run. I
   haven't tried running with them yet, though, so it may not be needed.

   @edowling how are they more prone to falling out of your ear when
   running? in the originals the wire actually pulls down on them towards
   gravity .. if anything the airpods should be more secure

   Web notifications: time to cure a disease in our workflowIntroducing
   Station's new Notification Center. Notifications came to life with an
   honorable aim in mind: telling users something new just happened. The
   sad truth is they have become hacks designed to steal our attention
   rather than meaningful insights into our work. We can receive up to one
   notification every 4 minutes.
   Your way of working belongs to the Stone Age - Station's official blog
   - MediumWe spend nearly ⅓ of our life online to get work done. Writing
   emails, editing spreadsheets, looking through analytics data, taking
   minutes - most of the work we achieve each and every day takes place in
   our trusty old Chrome, Firefox or Safari (and if you are a digital
   hipster, Internet Explorer).

   Having been a user of Franz for a long time now, I'm glad I found
   Station cause it has way more functionality :) Thank you for making
   this!

   Although, I'm not sure on how I can mute particular apps from sending
   me notifications 🙃

   EDIT 1: Multiple instances such as Twitter do not actually separate two
   accounts; if I log out of one, it logs out of the other.

   P.S: I'll edit this review once I use it for a bit longer :)
   Pros:

   Clean, minimal & functional.
   Cons:

   Needs a little more basic features.

   👋 Station is the best workflow improvement I've made recently. I've
   been a beta tester of Station for the past few months, that's why I am
   glad to hunt it today! All the places of the Internet where I like to
   spend time (Twitter, Slack channels, Github, Feedly, GDrive,
   Dribbble...) were spread among Chrome tabs, Desktop apps, and Menu bar
   icons. Now, it's all gathered in Station. The "commute" among these
   places disappeared. Going from a place to another now feels as easy as
   switching among Slack channels. Give it a try. Cheers!

   Edit: We got a lot of questions, so I'm adding the frequently asked
   ones here: If you have more questions, please share them in the
   community: https://community.getstation.com/ > Where can I find the
   installer? On https://getstation.com/ click "Download". No email
   required. > Cool, but these apps keep all apps open using RAM and CPU.
   Definitely, but, in Station, we addressed this issue! We idle
   applications you have not used for some time and pop it again as soon
   as you need it. That's transparent for the user, but it definitely has
   a positive impact on RAM and CPU! > Can you expand on what kind of
   privacy you have for this app? Except few telemetric data that helps in
   the development of the product, everything stays local. Naturally, all
   the applications running in Station (Slack, Gmail..) have their own
   privacy model. You can read more in our privacy policy note:
   https://station.slite.com/public... > Do you support multi-account? Yes
   we do, just add an app for the second time and it will let you connect
   it with a second account. > It looks like a very good idea, but I
   wanted to know what will be the business model before investing time in
   it? The Station app is free. We are currently testing "Station for
   teams" with some pilot companies. It includes specific features that
   will be part of paid plans. > How can I suggest an application to be
   included in Station's app store? To suggest a new application, you can
   type the name iof the application n the "app store" search and click
   "request". > What OS do you support? Mac and Windows. Linux is coming.
   --- Hi everyone! 👋 First off, big thanks to @ldesserrey for hunting us!
   🚀 Station is a free desktop app that centralizes all your work
   applications in one neat interface. Think of it as a super efficient
   workspace for all your web tools. We want to give you a snapshot into
   what we think the future of work will look like & hopefully build it
   together with you ! ;) We realise we still have a long way to go but
   our team has been working round the clock on this ambitious product for
   the past year & we're really excited to hear what you think 🤗 ! We'll
   be here all day to answer any questions you might have, so ask away!
   Cheers! 🍻

   I've been using Station since it's very beginning (9 months ago). I use
   it now on a daily basis.

   As a designer, I have on my desktop my Sketch, and of course my
   Station. It centralize all my work (InVision, Slacks, Gmail,
   Notifications, Trello... 300+ apps already, so crazy!). So no need to
   switch between thousand of tabs on chrome, or to set up my work
   everything morning. I just open Station and eveything is there : what I
   missed, my new assignments... It just makes you way more productive.

   Give it a try people and get Station now !
   Pros:

   nice experience, higher productivity, better perfs than chrome,
   centralized work, fast switcher, smart handle of pages, daily use base
   Cons:

   can't wait for Single Sign In, and password manager features !!

   Are you considered a night owl or early bird when it comes to personal
   productivity?
   Are you considered a night owl or early bird when focusing on your
   personal projects, especially for those of you with traditional 9-to-5
   workday jobs? There are those who are exhausted into the office every
   morning, while the early bird finds bursts of energy much earlier on
   For me I'm a special breed...overall I'm a night owl during the
   weeknights, and typically loves to be early riser on the weekends
   feeling there's a whole day ahead of me. That speaks to when I'll be

   For me I'm a special breed...I'm notorious for midnight hooting and
   working away on my artwork during the weeknights, and wakes up earlier
   than my pet lovebird Goldie during the weekends and holidays. Am I the
   abnormal one here or are there others who functions like I do as well?

   I love my AirPods and don't feel a need for these in every day usage.
   But I'd be tempted to get them for when I want to go for a run. I
   haven't tried running with them yet, though, so it may not be needed.

   @edowling how are they more prone to falling out of your ear when
   running? in the originals the wire actually pulls down on them towards
   gravity .. if anything the airpods should be more secure

   Web notifications: time to cure a disease in our workflowIntroducing
   Station's new Notification Center. Notifications came to life with an
   honorable aim in mind: telling users something new just happened. The
   sad truth is they have become hacks designed to steal our attention
   rather than meaningful insights into our work. We can receive up to one
   notification every 4 minutes.
   Your way of working belongs to the Stone Age - Station's official blog
   - MediumWe spend nearly ⅓ of our life online to get work done. Writing
   emails, editing spreadsheets, looking through analytics data, taking
   minutes - most of the work we achieve each and every day takes place in
   our trusty old Chrome, Firefox or Safari (and if you are a digital
   hipster, Internet Explorer).

   Having been a user of Franz for a long time now, I'm glad I found
   Station cause it has way more functionality :) Thank you for making
   this!

   Although, I'm not sure on how I can mute particular apps from sending
   me notifications 🙃

   EDIT 1: Multiple instances such as Twitter do not actually separate two
   accounts; if I log out of one, it logs out of the other.

   P.S: I'll edit this review once I use it for a bit longer :)
   Pros:

   Clean, minimal & functional.
   Cons:

   Needs a little more basic features.

   👋 Station is the best workflow improvement I've made recently. I've
   been a beta tester of Station for the past few months, that's why I am
   glad to hunt it today! All the places of the Internet where I like to
   spend time (Twitter, Slack channels, Github, Feedly, GDrive,
   Dribbble...) were spread among Chrome tabs, Desktop apps, and Menu bar
   icons. Now, it's all gathered in Station. The "commute" among these
   places disappeared. Going from a place to another now feels as easy as
   switching among Slack channels. Give it a try. Cheers!

   Edit: We got a lot of questions, so I'm adding the frequently asked
   ones here: If you have more questions, please share them in the
   community: https://community.getstation.com/ > Where can I find the
   installer? On https://getstation.com/ click "Download". No email
   required. > Cool, but these apps keep all apps open using RAM and CPU.
   Definitely, but, in Station, we addressed this issue! We idle
   applications you have not used for some time and pop it again as soon
   as you need it. That's transparent for the user, but it definitely has
   a positive impact on RAM and CPU! > Can you expand on what kind of
   privacy you have for this app? Except few telemetric data that helps in
   the development of the product, everything stays local. Naturally, all
   the applications running in Station (Slack, Gmail..) have their own
   privacy model. You can read more in our privacy policy note:
   https://station.slite.com/public... > Do you support multi-account? Yes
   we do, just add an app for the second time and it will let you connect
   it with a second account. > It looks like a very good idea, but I
   wanted to know what will be the business model before investing time in
   it? The Station app is free. We are currently testing "Station for
   teams" with some pilot companies. It includes specific features that
   will be part of paid plans. > How can I suggest an application to be
   included in Station's app store? To suggest a new application, you can
   type the name iof the application n the "app store" search and click
   "request". > What OS do you support? Mac and Windows. Linux is coming.
   --- Hi everyone! 👋 First off, big thanks to @ldesserrey for hunting us!
   🚀 Station is a free desktop app that centralizes all your work
   applications in one neat interface. Think of it as a super efficient
   workspace for all your web tools. We want to give you a snapshot into
   what we think the future of work will look like & hopefully build it
   together with you ! ;) We realise we still have a long way to go but
   our team has been working round the clock on this ambitious product for
   the past year & we're really excited to hear what you think 🤗 ! We'll
   be here all day to answer any questions you might have, so ask away!
   Cheers! 🍻

   Station. It centralize all my work (InVision, Slacks, Gmail,
   Notifications, Trello... 300+ apps already, so crazy!). So no need to
   switch between thousand of tabs on chrome, or to set up my work
   everything morning. I just open Station and eveything is there : what I
   missed, my new assignments... It just makes you way more productive.

   Give it a try people and get Station now !
   Pros:

   nice experience, higher productivity, better perfs than chrome,
   centralized work, fast switcher, smart handle of pages, daily use base
   Cons:

   can't wait for Single Sign In, and password manager features !!
