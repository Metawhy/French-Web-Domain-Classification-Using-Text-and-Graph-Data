Insane Clown Makeup Can Help You Dodge Facial Recognition Systems

   Looking for a reason to become a Juggalo?

   Twitter user @tahkion has discovered a new way to beat facial
   recognition systems, computer programs that analyze images or videos of
   people's faces for the purposes of identifying them.

   In a series of tweets on Saturday, the computer science blogger for
   WonderHowTo described how the face makeup favored by Juggalos -
   die-hard fans of the musical group Insane Clown Posse - confuses the
   systems to the point they can't accurately identify people.

     recognition successfully. if you want to avoid surveillance, become

   According to @tahkion, the key to the success of the makeup is where
   you put the paint. Blacking out the area below the mouth but above the
   chin - as many Juggalos do - tricks facial recognition systems into
   identifying jawline much closer to the mouth than it really is.

   This prevents the system from accurately connecting a person in Juggalo
   makeup to an image of that person without the makeup on.

     for anyone wondering why some face changes evade facial recognition
     and others don't, here's a visualization of how landmarks are placed
     on a few examples. juggalo makeup is particularly effective as it
     basically totally redefines what is interpreted as the jawline
     pic.twitter.com/dFSx5FEGc9
     — TAHKION (@tahkion) July 1, 2018

   However, as @tahkion explained in a reply to another Twitter user, a
   facial recognition system could likely match two images of the same
   painted Juggalo - assuming they wore their makeup exactly the same way
   in both images.

     because the makeup and no makeup pictures are so different, even if
     you had a picture with the makeup it would only match when the
     makeup is done in the same way. it would also only be linked to the
     no makeup photo if done manually by a human

   As facial recognition systems become more sophisticated, they're also
   becoming more commonly used. China is arguably at the forefront of this
   trend, using facial recognition tech to enforce laws and identify
   criminals, but the tech is quickly gaining favor in the US, too.

   Amazon has come under fire from privacy advocates and its own employees
   for helping US law enforcement agencies implement a facial recognition
   system, and in August, the US will begin using facial recognition
   technology to identify people entering and leaving the nation along
   part of its southern border.

   Past attempts to confuse these systems often involve complicated
   technology or deliver mixed results. Now, anyone who wants to keep
   their identity a secret simply needs to invest in some black and white
   body paint and check out a Juggalo makeup tutorial or two.

Wild Bees Have Been Found Building Nests Entirely Out of Plastic Waste

   MICHELLE STARR
   31 MAY 2019

   In the crop fields of Argentina, bees have been building nests for
   their young out of some strange materials. For the first time,
   scientists have found bee nests made entirely out of plastic waste.

   A lot of plastic in the form of packaging comes into farms, and often
   makes its way into the landscape. The world is changing, and wildlife
   is having to adapt - but whether they can adapt fast enough to keep up
   with human impact is still up for debate.

   Researchers from Argentina's National Agricultural Technology Institute
   discovered the plastic nests as part of their research into chicory
   pollinators.

   The team had set up 63 trap nests around crop fields: these are a bit
   like those bee hotels that you can build in your backyard for solitary
   bees, with long, hollow tubes, similar to the honeycomb holes where bee
   larvae grow.

   Bees can line these cavities with materials they forage such as mud,
   leaves, stone, petals and resin. They build these materials into a cosy
   nest in the cavity, separated into brood cells along the length, each
   of which holds a growing bee larva.

   Over the spring and summer of 2017 and 2018, the team checked their
   trap nests monthly to look for signs of bee activity.

   They only found three nests the bees used. Two were built with mud and
   petals, and five healthy adult bees emerged from them.

   The third had three cells entirely constructed out of plastic,
   carefully cut into oblong and oval shapes by the bee, and arranged in
   an overlapping manner. The first two cells were constructed of thin,
   light blue plastic, similar to a plastic shopping bag. The third cell
   was made of thicker white plastic.

   bee nest Clockwise: Plastic waste caught in a fence; plastic bee nest;
   the pieces of plastic; the cells. (Allasino et al., Apidologie, 2019)

   "Among the three cells," the researchers wrote in their paper, "one
   contained a dead larva; from the other, the adult seemed to have
   emerged from the nest; and the third cell was not finished."

   So, of the two occupied cells, one larva died and the other grew to
   adulthood - indicating that plastic might not be the best choice of
   building material, but it might not be the worst, either.

   The team were unable to make a positive identification of the bee that
   had built the nest, but believe it may have been an alfalfa leafcutter
   bee (Megachile rotundata). This is an introduced European species the
   team had previously seen in the study site, and its lifestyle fits.

   It's a solitary bee that, true to its name, cuts leaves to line its
   nests, similar to the manner in which the plastic fragments were
   trimmed. And, in North America, scientists have documented this
   particular bee using plastic to construct individual brood cells within
   a larger nest.

   What makes this new nest so striking is that all the cells in the nest
   were constructed of plastic; and it's the first documented case where
   two different types of plastic were used.

   And it might not actually be bad news. It could, the researchers said,
   mean that bees have an adaptive flexibility that will allow them to
   keep up with rapid environmental changes.

   Or it might mean that herbicides used in fields are reducing the number
   of plants the bees prefer to use in their nests. Or, because the bee in
   this instance only used plastic, without any leaves, it prefers that
   material for another reason - maybe plastic provides an adaptive
   advantage we are unaware of, the way some birds use cigarette butts to
   repel parasites.

   It's impossible to tell from a single nest.

   "However," the researchers wrote, "it could highlight bees' response
   capacity in the search for alternative materials for the construction
   of their nests in the face of human disturbance."

   The research has been published in Apidologie.

Wild Bees Have Been Found Building Nests Entirely Out of Plastic Waste

   MICHELLE STARR
   31 MAY 2019

   In the crop fields of Argentina, bees have been building nests for
   their young out of some strange materials. For the first time,
   scientists have found bee nests made entirely out of plastic waste.

   A lot of plastic in the form of packaging comes into farms, and often
   makes its way into the landscape. The world is changing, and wildlife
   is having to adapt - but whether they can adapt fast enough to keep up
   with human impact is still up for debate.

   Researchers from Argentina's National Agricultural Technology Institute
   discovered the plastic nests as part of their research into chicory
   pollinators.

   The team had set up 63 trap nests around crop fields: these are a bit
   like those bee hotels that you can build in your backyard for solitary
   bees, with long, hollow tubes, similar to the honeycomb holes where bee
   larvae grow.

   Bees can line these cavities with materials they forage such as mud,
   leaves, stone, petals and resin. They build these materials into a cosy
   nest in the cavity, separated into brood cells along the length, each
   of which holds a growing bee larva.

   Over the spring and summer of 2017 and 2018, the team checked their
   trap nests monthly to look for signs of bee activity.

   They only found three nests the bees used. Two were built with mud and
   petals, and five healthy adult bees emerged from them.

   The third had three cells entirely constructed out of plastic,
   carefully cut into oblong and oval shapes by the bee, and arranged in
   an overlapping manner. The first two cells were constructed of thin,
   light blue plastic, similar to a plastic shopping bag. The third cell
   was made of thicker white plastic.

   bee nest Clockwise: Plastic waste caught in a fence; plastic bee nest;
   the pieces of plastic; the cells. (Allasino et al., Apidologie, 2019)

   "Among the three cells," the researchers wrote in their paper, "one
   contained a dead larva; from the other, the adult seemed to have
   emerged from the nest; and the third cell was not finished."

   So, of the two occupied cells, one larva died and the other grew to
   adulthood - indicating that plastic might not be the best choice of
   building material, but it might not be the worst, either.

   The team were unable to make a positive identification of the bee that
   had built the nest, but believe it may have been an alfalfa leafcutter
   bee (Megachile rotundata). This is an introduced European species the
   team had previously seen in the study site, and its lifestyle fits.

   It's a solitary bee that, true to its name, cuts leaves to line its
   nests, similar to the manner in which the plastic fragments were
   trimmed. And, in North America, scientists have documented this
   particular bee using plastic to construct individual brood cells within
   a larger nest.

   What makes this new nest so striking is that all the cells in the nest
   were constructed of plastic; and it's the first documented case where
   two different types of plastic were used.

   And it might not actually be bad news. It could, the researchers said,
   mean that bees have an adaptive flexibility that will allow them to
   keep up with rapid environmental changes.

   Or it might mean that herbicides used in fields are reducing the number
   of plants the bees prefer to use in their nests. Or, because the bee in
   this instance only used plastic, without any leaves, it prefers that
   material for another reason - maybe plastic provides an adaptive
   advantage we are unaware of, the way some birds use cigarette butts to
   repel parasites.

   It's impossible to tell from a single nest.

   "However," the researchers wrote, "it could highlight bees' response
   capacity in the search for alternative materials for the construction
   of their nests in the face of human disturbance."

   The research has been published in Apidologie.

       Insane Clown Makeup Can Help You Dodge Facial Recognition Systems

  By Kristin Houser, Futurism

  July 05, 2018

   Looking for a reason to become a Juggalo?

   Twitter user @tahkion has discovered a new way to beat facial
   recognition systems, computer programs that analyze images or videos of
   people's faces for the purposes of identifying them.

   In a series of tweets on Saturday, the computer science blogger for
   WonderHowTo described how the face makeup favored by Juggalos -
   die-hard fans of the musical group Insane Clown Posse - confuses the
   systems to the point they can't accurately identify people.

   According to @tahkion, the key to the success of the makeup is where
   you put the paint. Blacking out the area below the mouth but above the
   chin - as many Juggalos do - tricks facial recognition systems into
   identifying jawline much closer to the mouth than it really is.

   This prevents the system from accurately connecting a person in Juggalo
   makeup to an image of that person without the makeup on.

   However, as @tahkion explained in a reply to another Twitter user, a
   facial recognition system could likely match two images of the same
   painted Juggalo - assuming they wore their makeup exactly the same way
   in both images.

   As facial recognition systems become more sophisticated, they're also
   becoming more commonly used. China is arguably at the forefront of this
   trend, using facial recognition tech to enforce laws and identify
   criminals, but the tech is quickly gaining favor in the US, too.

   Amazon has come under fire from privacy advocates and its own employees
   for helping US law enforcement agencies implement a facial recognition
   system, and in August, the US will begin using facial recognition
   technology to identify people entering and leaving the nation along
   part of its southern border.

   Past attempts to confuse these systems often involve complicated
   technology or deliver mixed results. Now, anyone who wants to keep
   their identity a secret simply needs to invest in some black and white
   body paint and check out a Juggalo makeup tutorial or two.
