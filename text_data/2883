Sovrn Holdings, Inc. Services Privacy Policy

   Effective Date: August 22, 2019

   Sovrn Holdings, Inc. (“Sovrn” or “we”) provides this privacy policy
   (“Privacy Policy“) to describe our and our subsidiaries’ information
   practices for our Publishers and Consumers (together, “you”) who use
   the Sovrn Services. Capitalized terms are defined in this Privacy
   Policy. For information on our information practices for our websites,
   please see the Sovrn Website Privacy policy and the Sovrn Commerce
   Website Privacy Policy.

   By using the Sovrn Services or submitting Personal Information through
   our Sovrn Services, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this
   Privacy Policy and to the processing of your Personal Information in
   accordance with this Privacy Policy.

What This Privacy Policy Covers

   Through the Sovrn Services including the Sovrn publisher platform and
   other Sovrn publisher tools and widgets, the Sovrn ad exchange, Sovrn
   header bidding, Sovrn video products, Sovrn analytics and data
   services, the Sovrn Commerce affiliate linking services, and other
   Sovrn products and services (together the “Sovrn Services“), we collect
   information about Publishers and Consumers. “Publishers” are websites
   or publications that use Sovrn Services, or natural persons who
   interact with Sovrn on behalf of such websites or publications.
   “Consumers” are individuals who visit our Publishers’ websites.

   This Privacy Policy describes Sovrn’s use of Personal Information and
   Other Information that we collect when you use the Sovrn Services.
   “Personal Information” means any information that can be used to
   directly or indirectly identify a natural person, such as contact
   information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and/or phone number),
   any other data that is associated with the contact information, and/or
   information that uniquely and persistently identifies a browser or
   device such as an IP address, mobile advertising identifier, cookie
   identifier, or email address that has been hashed to generate an
   alphanumeric identifier, or combination of information about a browser
   or device (such as IP address and browser type/settings). “Other
   Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to
   your Personal Information including aggregate or de-identified
   information.

   We collect and use Personal Information and Other Information as
   described in this Privacy Policy from both Publishers and Consumers.
   The practices described in this policy apply to both Publisher and
   Consumer information unless otherwise stated.

   The Sovrn Services contain links to websites or content, including
   advertisements, operated and maintained by third parties, over which we
   have no control. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a
   third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.

Information You Provide to Us

   The Personal Information we gather helps us provide the Sovrn Services
   and learn more about how you use Sovrn Services. You may choose to
   provide us with Personal Information by interacting with us. For
   example, if you sign up for a mailing list or otherwise request
   information, we collect your email address. When you contact us by
   sending us an email or providing other feedback, we will collect any
   information that is contained in your email or feedback.

   Information from Publishers: We collect additional Personal Information
   from Publishers. The Publisher registration process through Sovrn
   requires a valid email address and a username and password. For some of
   our Services, Publishers may register using an existing Google account.
   For Publishers who register through Google, we will receive your email
   address and profile information. We may also request information from
   you to support use of the Sovrn Services, such as the first and last
   name, bio, year of birth, telephone number, websites, software, mobile
   applications, log in IP addresses, physical address, zip code, and
   country of residence for the Publisher contact. We may collect
   information about the categories of content our Publishers typically
   make available to others on pages integrated with Sovrn Services and
   link this information to Personal Information provided for that
   account. For example, we categorize the types of content that
   Publishers make available. We collect payment information from
   Publishers who purchase Sovrn Services, including by participating in
   our advertising services. A Publisher may also choose to provide us
   with log-in credentials for accounts with third-party services such as
   online advertising providers, in order for Sovrn to provide services,
   such as reporting, based on information from those third-party
   services.

   You can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but
   this may limit the features of the Sovrn Services you are able to use.

Information Collected Via Technology

   As you use the Sovrn Services as a Publisher or browse websites within
   the Sovrn Publisher network as a Consumer, certain information may also
   be collected passively (as described in this section), including your
   web viewing and search activities across unrelated websites, mobile
   application usage, browser agent, browser type, operating system, IP
   address (which may be used to generate your approximate geographic
   location), device type, mobile device identifiers, email address that
   has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, use of ad
   blocking tools, information about the possible relationships among
   different browsers and devices, and information about the precise
   location of your device (if you have allowed a website to collect your
   location through your browser or have enabled location services on a
   mobile device). This information may be linked to Personal Information
   that identifies your browser or device, including through cookies.

   Sovrn Commerce enables Publishers to add links on locations including,
   but not limited to, webpages, sites, software, social media, and mobile
   applications to merchant destinations. When a Consumer clicks through
   Sovrn Commerce affiliated links to a merchant destination and then
   makes a purchase or submits a lead, the Publisher that generated the
   traffic is paid a referral fee or commission.

   The term ‘cookies’ is used as an umbrella term for various technologies
   used to identify browsers, such as HTML cookies, Flash cookies,
   scripts, web beacons and pixel tags. With each of these technologies, a
   small (text) file is placed by a web server on the device visiting the
   website or service, which can be read out during further use. For
   convenience, these techniques are collectively referred to in this
   Privacy Policy as “cookies“.

Sovrn may store cookies on your device:

     * For Publishers, to allow you to use our Sovrn Services, and access
       secure areas of the Sovrn Services. Without these cookies, it is
       not possible to load or offer key functionalities on our website,
       such as logging in to your account, displaying dynamic elements or
       uploading information.
     * For both Publishers and Consumers, for statistical purposes and to
       analyze and improve the use and performance of our Sovrn Services
       and to do the same for our Publishers’ websites.
     * For Consumers, to support the Sovrn Services that are described in
       this policy, such as for our analytics and data services and to
       provide Consumers with interest-based advertising, including
       through Google’s Exchange Bidding service, and the ability to opt
       out of such advertising as further described in this Privacy
       Policy.

   Our Sovrn Services may use both session cookies (which expire once you
   close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your
   device until you delete them). For more information about how cookies
   are used or what information we collect, please click here.

Information from Other Sources

   We may receive Other Information as well as Personal Information about
   you from other sources, and combine it with the information that we
   collect through the Sovrn Services. In addition to the types of
   information described above, this Personal Information may include, for
   example, mobile advertising identifiers, information about your
   activities across unrelated websites or mobile applications,
   demographic information, email address that has been hashed to generate
   an alphanumeric identifier, information about the possible
   relationships between different browsers and devices, information about
   you from offline sources, and/or precise information about the past or
   present location of a mobile device. These sources may include
   information conveyed to us by telephone or fax, information that we
   receive from third-party data providers, or information provided to us
   by third parties in a Publisher network.

For Consumers: Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out

   For our legitimate business interests, and with your consent where this
   is required, we may process and disclose your Personal Information for
   interest-based advertising as described in this section.

   Opting Out of Sovrn’s Activities: Sovrn collects, uses, and discloses
   web viewing data, app usage data, and precise location data across
   non-affiliated sites and apps over time for the purpose of delivering
   interest-based advertising to this device or different devices. You can
   choose to opt out of Sovrn’s interest-based advertising activities on
   your device. If you choose to opt out, we will not collect, use, or
   transfer such data from or on the device that you opted out, for the
   purpose of interest-based advertising.

   If you wish to opt out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such
   data from your browser for interest-based advertising purposes, you can
   visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about interest-based advertising
   and to exercise your opt-out choice with respect to Sovrn and other
   companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
   self-regulatory program.

   If you wish to opt-out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such
   data from your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes,
   you can download the DAA’s AppChoices app from your device’s
   application store. If you opt out through AppChoices, we will not
   collect, use or transfer such data from or on that device for
   interest-based advertising.

   When you use the opt-out tools above, your choice will be effective
   only on the browser or device where you exercised the choice. If you
   use a different device or browser, you will need to renew your opt-out
   choice. Our opt-out tool for browsers is cookie-based. It will be
   installed only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies,
   and if you delete this cookie then you will need to renew your opt-out
   choice. Even if you opt out on your browser or your mobile device, we
   may continue to collect, use and transfer such data for other purposes
   such as contextual advertising based on a current visit to a website,
   fraud prevention, improving site performance and other purposes
   referred to in this Privacy Policy.

   Opting out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser.
   Even if you opt out, you still may receive advertising from the Sovrn
   Services when you visit websites of a Publisher who uses our Services,
   but that advertising will not be targeted to you. If you opt out of
   Sovrn’s practices, you may also continue to receive interest-based
   advertising through other companies.

   Opting Out of Sovrn Commerce: If you want Sovrn Commerce to stop
   collecting or storing personal data about the websites you visit, the
   links you click, or the merchants you make purchases from, you can
   choose to opt-out out of Sovrn Commerce cookies using our opt-out page.
   Opting out of Sovrn Commerce cookies means that Sovrn Commerce will
   stop placing cookies on your device when you browse Sovrn Commerce
   enabled websites and/or links. To honor your opt-out choice, we need to
   place a cookie on your device so that we know not to track your
   activity. Clearing your browser’s cache or cookies will remove this
   cookie, and you will be required to opt-out of tracking again.
   Similarly, if you access sites that use Sovrn Commerce from a different
   browser or device than the browser or device you opted out of tracking
   on, you will be required to opt-out again.

Use of Personal Information

   We process Personal Information to enable our business and pursue our
   legitimate interests, including but not limited to the following:
     * For Consumers:
          + We will use your Personal Information to provide
            interest-based advertising and to support third parties’
            interest-based advertising activities as described above.
          + We will use your Personal Information to provide a variety of
            services to Publishers and other business partners including
            analytics and data services, and to enable Publishers to offer
            you choices related to your use of ad blocking technology and
            your ad experience on their websites.
          + For Sovrn Commerce and similar services, we will use your
            Personal Information to optimize links, determine the best
            merchant destination for clicks, and set the appropriate
            language and region for click destinations.
     * For Publishers:
          + We will use your Personal Information to provide products and
            services you have requested, and respond to any comments or
            complaints you may send us.
          + Sovrn will use a Publisher’s payment account information to
            make payments to you as part of our Services, if applicable.
          + If a Publisher chooses to provide us with log-in credentials
            for accounts with third-party services such as online
            advertising providers, Sovrn will use the credentials to
            access and provide you with services you request, such as
            reporting on your use of those third-party services. Sovrn may
            also use aggregate data obtained in this way for our internal
            purposes to improve the Sovrn Services.
          + We may monitor any Publisher account to prevent, investigate
            and/or report fraud, terrorism, misrepresentation, security
            incidents or crime, in accordance with applicable law.
          + We may also use the Personal Information you provided to
            provide you with electronic newsletters, transactional, or
            promotional e-mails.
     * For Everyone:
          + We monitor the use of the Sovrn Services, and use your
            Personal Information to help us monitor, improve and protect
            our products, content, services and websites.
          + We may use your information to invite you to take part in
            market research.
          + We may use your Personal Information to comply with applicable
            laws and protect Sovrn legitimate business interests and legal
            rights, including, but not limited to, use in connection with
            legal claims, compliance, regulatory, investigative purposes
            (including disclosure of such information in connection with
            law enforcement requests, legal process or litigation).

Use of Other Information

   We may collect Other Information through the Sovrn Services or we may
   create Other Information records from Personal Information by excluding
   information (such as your name or email address) that makes the
   information identifiable to you or your device. We may use Other
   Information for a variety of purposes to operate and improve the Sovrn
   Services.

   As examples, we may use Other Information for purposes that include
   testing our IT systems, analyzing usage patterns, market research, data
   analysis, improving the Sovrn Services and developing new products.

   We may also use Other Information on Consumers’ activities at Publisher
   websites, such as page views, use of ad blocking technology, and search
   queries, to provide aggregate information to Publishers so that they
   can improve their offerings.

Disclosure of Information

   We may disclose or provide your Personal Information to others as
   described in this Privacy Policy.

   For Sovrn Commerce and similar services, we will use your Personal
   Information to optimize links, determine the best merchant destination
   for clicks, and set the appropriate language and region for click
   destinations.
     * Publishers: We may disclose Personal Information to Publishers and
       their service providers in order to provide the Sovrn Services,
       such as measuring the effectiveness ofadvertising, advertising
       attribution, and preventing advertising fraud.
     * Other Third-Party Customers: We may disclose Personal Information
       that identifies their own purposes. Please see above for more
       information on how we may disclose Personal Information for
       interest-based advertising, and your choices related to this
       practice.
     * Service Providers: We may provide your Personal Information to
       third-party service providers and data processors who work on
       behalf of or with us to provide the Sovrn Services and to help us
       communicate with you. Examples include other advertising services
       and data enrichment services. Examples of such services include
       sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
       processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing
       customer service.
     * Affiliates: Sovrn may share some or all of your Personal
       Information with our Affiliates(i.e., companies which are under
       common control, such as subsidiaries or joint ventures), in which
       case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy in
       all material respects.
     * Business Transitions: In the event Sovrn goes through a business
       transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or
       sale of all or a portion of its assets including in bankruptcy,
       your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You
       acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
       Sovrn or its assets may continue to process your Personal
       Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
     * Law Enforcement: We may disclose your Personal Information if we
       believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a)
       comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants
       served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property
       of Sovrn, you, or third parties.
     * Other Information: We may use and disclose Other Information for
       any purpose in our discretion, to the extent permitted under
       applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as

       disclose it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose
       Personal Information.

Data Retention

   For Publishers: We will keep Publishers’ Personal Information for the
   length of any contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the
   extent permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as
   necessary to perform the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. This
   includes maintaining Publishers’ Personal Information after our
   relationship ends to protect ourselves from legal claims, to comply
   with law, or to administer our business.

   For Consumers: For Personal Information collected through our Sovrn
   Commerce services, our policy is to retain Consumers’ Personal
   Information for a maximum of eighteen months. Consumer Personal
   Information collected through all other Sovrn Services is to be
   retained for a maximum of one year. However, laws, legal claims or
   other particular circumstances may require us to keep certain Personal
   Information longer.

   We may retain Other Information for our business purposes, in our
   discretion or as permitted by law.

Publisher Choices

   Unsubscribe instructions will accompany each promotional email we send
   you. You can also contact us in order to change your preferences with
   respect to promotional emails (or other contacts if you are registered
   as a Publisher) by emailing us at marketing@sovrn.com. We will send you
   messages related to our relationship or transactions with you. You may
   not opt-out of these communications, but if you do not wish to receive
   these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account as
   discussed below.

   For Consumers, please see above for information on opting out of
   Sovrn’s collection, use and transfer of data for interest-based
   advertising purposes.

For Publishers: Access and Changes to Your Personal Information

   Connected to the Sovrn Services, we store and may display some of the
   information entered upon creation of a Publisher account, such as
   username (or display name) and bio, as well as network of connections.
   In order to access and remove or modify this bio and display name,
   and/or other contact information that is not displayed, you may login
   to your Sovrn account, select the “Account” option, and edit the
   contact details. To prevent any other information from the account
   being displayed by the Sovrn Services, you may contact us
   at publishersupport@sovrn.com to deactivate your account. When we
   deactivate Personal Information, it will be deactivated from our active
   databases but may remain in our archives.

Additional Rights for Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA)

   You may be entitled to ask us for a copy of your Personal Information,
   to correct it, to erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to
   transfer some of this information to other organizations. As further
   detailed in other sections of this Privacy Policy, you may also have
   rights to object to some processing, such as profiling we perform for
   the purposes of direct marketing and interest-based advertisement, and,
   where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw
   this consent. In some cases, you can exercise these rights through
   automated means. Where this is not possible you can contact us through
   our web form or through the contact details provided under the “Contact
   Us” section later in this Privacy Policy. These rights may be limited
   in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have
   a legal requirement to process your data. In some instances, this may
   mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent.

   Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or
   contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if
   such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our
   contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all
   other cases, provision of requested Personal Information is optional.

Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information

   Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where
   it was collected as well as other countries (including the United
   States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be
   less stringent than the laws in your country.

   Where Personal Information is transferred outside of the EEA to a data
   importer in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by
   the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by an appropriate
   safeguard such as approved standard contractual clauses (by the EU
   Commission, the European Data Protection Supervisor or a competent
   authority). More information on the relevant mechanism can be provided
   to you by contacting us through the details at the bottom of this
   Privacy Policy.

Security and Confidentiality

   Sovrn has put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic,
   and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal
   Information we collect.

   We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in

Sovrn Holdings, Inc. Website Privacy Policy

   Effective Date: August 22, 2019

   Sovrn Holdings, Inc. (“Sovrn” or “we”) provides this privacy policy
   (“Privacy Policy“) to describe our and our subsidiaries’ information
   practices related to the information we collect when individuals
   (“you”) visit sovrn.com (“Site”). To learn about our information
   practices for our services, please see the Sovrn Services Privacy
   Policy.

   By visiting or submitting Personal Information through the Site, you
   acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the
   processing of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy
   Policy.

What This Privacy Policy Covers

   “Personal Information” means any information that can be used to
   directly or indirectly identify a natural person, such as contact
   information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and/or phone number),
   any other data that is associated with the contact information, and/or
   information that identifies a browser or device such as an IP address,
   mobile advertising identifier, cookie identifier, email address that
   has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, or combination
   of information about a browser or device (such as IP address and
   browser type/settings). “Other Information” means information that is
   not associated with or linked to your Personal Information including
   aggregate or de-identified information.

   The Site contains links to websites or content operated and maintained
   by third parties, over which we have no control. We encourage you to
   review the privacy policy of any third-party website before disclosing
   any information to the website.

Information You Provide to Us

   The Personal Information we gather from you helps us provide the Site
   and learn more about how the Site is used. We collect Personal
   Information that you submit to us voluntarily, such as your name and
   contact information.

   For example, if you fill out a form on the Site or sign up for a
   newsletter, we collect your email address. When you contact us by
   sending us an email or providing other feedback, we will collect any
   information that is contained in your email or feedback.

   You can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but
   this may limit the features of the Site you are able to use.

   Information Collected Via Technology
   As you use the Site, certain information may also be collected
   passively (as described in this section), including your web viewing
   and search activities, browser type, operating system, cookie
   identifiers, and IP address. This information may be linked to Personal
   Information that identifies your browser or device, including through
   cookies.

   The term ‘cookies’ is used as an umbrella term for various technologies
   used to identify browsers, such as HTML cookies, Flash cookies,
   scripts, web beacons and pixel tags. With each of these technologies, a
   small (text) file is placed by a web server on the device visiting the
   website or service, which can be read out during further use. For
   convenience, these techniques are collectively referred to in this
   Privacy Policy as “cookies“.

   For example, Sovrn (or our third-party partners) may store cookies on
   your device:
     * To allow you to navigate our website. These cookies allow us to
       load or offer key functionalities on our website, such as
       displaying dynamic elements or uploading information.
     * To provide you with social media and multimedia functionalities.
       Videos and other media often rely on cookies to function correctly.
       In addition, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter
       can use cookies to see if you are logged in and enable you to
       “like” content or send it to your friends. When you use these
       features, such third-party companies can collect information from
       you. Depending on your settings, these external parties may also
       use such information for advertising purposes. If you would like to
       know more about this, please refer to the respective privacy
       policies of these third parties.
     * For statistical purposes and to analyze and improve the use and
       performance of the Site.
     * To provide interest-based advertising and the ability to opt out of
       such advertising as further described in this Privacy Policy.

   Our Site may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your
   web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until
   you delete them). For more information about how cookies are used or
   what information is collected, please click here.

Information from Other Sources

   We may receive Other Information as well as Personal Information about
   you from other sources and combine it with the information collected
   through the Site.

Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising

   We work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site
   and other websites or online services over time for non-advertising
   purposes. For example, we use Google Analytics and other third-party
   services to improve the performance of the Service and for analytics
   and marketing purposes. For more information about how Google Analytics
   collects and uses data when you use the Service, visit
   https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and to opt out of
   Google Analytics, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. We
   also enable third- party partners to collect web viewing data on the
   Site for “interest-based advertising,” which is the process of showing
   you targeted ads on one or more devices that are more likely to be
   relevant to you based on inferences drawn from your Web viewing data
   collected across non-affiliated websites and online services, over time
   and across browsers and devices. These third-party partners may also
   use their own cookies to display and track their ads. To opt out of
   this type of advertising from companies participating in the Digital
   Advertising Alliance or European Digital Advertising Alliance
   self-regulatory programs, you can visit www.aboutads.info/choices (for
   U.S. residents) or www.youronlinechoices.eu (for UK and further EU
   residents). Sovrn adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s
   Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with these activities.

   This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any
   third-party ad partners. To learn more about the practices of these
   companies, please read their privacy policies.

Use of Personal Information

   We process Personal Information to enable our business and pursue our
   legitimate interests, including but not limited to the following:
     * We will use your Personal Information to provide products and
       services you have requested, and respond to any comments or
       complaints you may send us;
     * We monitor the use of the Site, and use your Personal Information
       to help us monitor, improve and protect our products, content,
       services and websites;

       research. We may also use the Personal Information you provide to
       provide you with electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails.

   laws and protection of Sovrn’s legitimate business interests and legal
   rights, including, but not limited to, use in connection with legal
   claims, compliance, regulatory, investigative purposes (including
   disclosure of such information in connection with law enforcement
   requests, legal process or litigation).

Use of Other Information

   We may collect Other Information through the Site or we may create
   Other Information records from Personal Information by excluding
   information (such as your name or email address) that makes the
   information identifiable to you or your device. We may use Other
   Information for a variety of purposes to operate and improve the Site.

   As examples, we may use Other Information for purposes that include
   testing our IT systems, analyzing usage patterns, market research, data
   analysis, improving the Site and developing new products.

       marketing providers and analytics companies. Examples of such
       services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing
       assistance, and providing customer service.
     * Affiliates: Sovrn may share some or all of your Personal
       Information with our Affiliates (i.e., companies which are under
       common control, such as subsidiaries or joint ventures), in which
       case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy in
       all material respects.
     * Business Transitions: In the event Sovrn goes through a business
       transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or
       sale of all or a portion of its assets including in bankruptcy,
       your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You
       acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
       Sovrn or its assets may continue to process your Personal
       Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
     * Law Enforcement: We may disclose your Personal Information if we
       believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a)
       comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants
       served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property
       of Sovrn, you, or third parties.
     * Other Information: We may use and disclose Other Information for
       any purpose in our discretion, to the extent permitted under
       applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as

   of one year. Laws, legal claims or other particular circumstances may
   require us to keep certain Personal Information longer.

   discretion or as permitted by law.

Sovrn, Inc. Publisher Agreement

   This Publisher Agreement (the “Agreement“) sets forth the legally
   binding terms between you and Sovrn, Inc. for your use of the Services
   (as defined below), to the extent we make the Services available to you
   as the owner or operator (“Publisher“) of one or more websites, blogs
   and/or other properties approved by us (collectively, “Publisher
   Sites“). By accessing and using the Services, you agree to comply with
   and be bound by this Agreement. The Services are for business or
   commercial use, and are not to be used for personal, household, or
   family purposes.
    1. Services. We (i) provide Publishers with tools, technology and
       services to track, analyze, engage and grow their audiences,
       (ii) operate a real-time, data driven automation platform for
       advertising, data management and yield optimization, facilitating
       the integration of third party providers of online advertising and
       data on one or more of the Publisher Sites, and (iii) aggregate and
       license data to third parties relating to the operation of such
       platform (collectively, the “Services”). If we offer any additional
       Services in the future that are governed by additional terms, we
       will make such additional terms available to you and, unless
       otherwise provided, such additional terms will be incorporated
       herein.
    2. Account. Your use of the Services is subject to your creation and
       our approval of an account (an “Account”). By submitting an
       application to use the Services, if you are an individual, you
       represent that you are at least 18 years of age.
    3. Authorization. You may request to add any of your websites, blogs
       and/or other properties to the Services. We may, in our discretion,
       reject your request and/or remove any of your Publisher Sites from
       the Services at any time. You agree to adhere to our Ad Exchange
       Supply Policy and provide any additional information regarding your
       Publisher Sites and proposed Publisher Sites that we may reasonably
       request. You authorize us to (i) serve content, advertising
       materials and/or related technology (the “Ads”) from advertisers on
       your Publisher Sites and (ii) collect, access, index and copy your
       Content (as defined below in Section 6), and to collect site, user
       and third party data related to your Publisher Sites (collectively,
       the “Publisher Data”). Any Publisher Data that we aggregate with
       other data (including our own data and third party data relating to
       your Publisher Sites) for any purpose shall be referred to herein
       as “Sovrn Data”. We grant you a license to include on the
       applicable Publisher Sites the software code we provide to you (the
       “Code”) required for us to provide the Services. You must place the
       Code, without modification, directly within either the HTML code or
       the Ad server of the applicable Publisher Site that we have
       approved in writing for such use. You may not cover or obscure any
       Ads via HTML/CSS, scripting or any other means. Upon our written
       request, you will promptly remove Code from any of your Publisher
       Sites. You may not place Code on any Publisher Site that we have
       not approved in advance. We may reject or remove a specific Ad,
       modify or suspend the Services and/or delete your Account at any
       time for any reason or no reason. Unless we expressly agree
       otherwise, we will have sole discretion to: (a) identify, select
       and manage relationships with advertisers; (b) establish pricing
       and other terms and conditions with advertisers; and (c) take all
       actions relating to the foregoing.
    4. License; Publicity. You hereby grant us an unrestricted,
       irrevocable, perpetual, fully-paid and royalty-free right to use,
       create derivative works from and sub-license (including without
       limitation, the right to grant further sub-licenses) the Publisher
       Data for the purposes of (i) aggregating and licensing the
       Publisher Data to third parties in connection with the Services and
       (ii) providing and improving the Services. You hereby grant us an
       unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, fully-paid and royalty-free
       right to use and sub-license (including without limitation, the
       right to grant further sub-licenses) the Content for the sole
       purpose of providing and improving the Services. We may use your
       name and logo in presentations and marketing communications. We
       may, at our discretion, place terms such as “Ads by Sovrn” together
       with a hyperlink as part of the Ad on any of your Publisher Sites.
    5. Use of the Services. You are solely responsible for your use of the
       Services (e.g., access to and use of the Account and safeguarding
       usernames and passwords) and the Sovrn Data. Use of the Services
       and the Sovrn Data is subject to all applicable legislations,
       guidelines and policies, including, without limitation, privacy and
       data protection legislations, our privacy policy (available
       at https://www.sovrn.com/sovrn-legal-policies/), and you
       acknowledge and agree that you will be bound by the applicable
       privacy policy relevant to each user’s jurisdiction of residence
       (collectively, the “Policies”).
    6. Restrictions. You will not (i) use the Services or the Sovrn Data
       except as expressly authorized herein; (ii) use the Sovrn Data for
       any purpose other than internal analytics purposes, (iii) except as
       permitted by applicable law, copy, reproduce, modify, distribute,
       damage, interfere with, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or
       create derivative works of the Services or the Sovrn Data; (iv)
       breach, disable, tamper with or interfere with the proper working
       of the Services or the Sovrn Data or develop or use (or attempt)
       any workaround for any security measure related to the Services or
       the Sovrn Data; or (v) place any Content (as defined below) on any
       of your Publisher Sites that (a) infringes or misappropriates a
       third party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights,
       (b) breaches a third party’s rights or privacy or publicity or
       (c) contains or promotes Objectionable Activity (as defined below).

       (w) pornographic, illegal, fraudulent, false, deceptive,
       misleading, libelous, defamatory or threatening, (x) racist, hate
       speech or bullying, (y) adware, malware, spyware or any other
       malicious code or drive-by download applications and/or (z) “spam,”

       not permitted by law. “Content” means any blog entries, bookmarks,
       postings, messages, opinions, text, files, links, images, photos,
       video, sounds, works of authorship, feedback, bug reports and other
       materials available on any of your Publisher Sites.
    7. Legal Compliance.  Publisher represents and warrants that all
       Publisher Data is provided to or collected by Sovrn in compliance
       with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, mobile and social
       media platform rules and policies, and the United States Digital
       Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles published
       at AboutAds (“DAA Self-Regulatory Principles”) including the
       corresponding DAA-designated self-regulatory frameworks established
       in other countries and/or regions. For avoidance of doubt,
       applicable laws will include the EU Directive on Privacy and
       Electronic Communications (2002/58/EC), any national laws
       implementing such Directives and/or, when applicable, the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), and any legislation or
       regulation amending, supplementing or any of the foregoing from
       time to time (together “EU Privacy Laws“) for any Publisher
       providing content to readers within the European Economic Area.

       must comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and
       self-regulatory standards.  Publisher must comply with the enhanced
       notice obligations applicable to first parties under the DAA
       Self-Regulatory Principles including providing a link from the

    9. Data Rights. Publisher agrees that at Sovrn’s discretion, Sovrn may
       use the Consent of the visitors to the site, including Consent
       provided under the specifications of the IAB Europe’s GDPR
       Transparency & Consent Framework described at AdvertisingConsent
       (the “Consent Framework”), as the lawful basis for collecting and
       processing the personal information of the visitors to the site,
       including the visitor’s pseudonymised cookie identifier. In the
       absence of such  Consent, Publisher may indicate to Sovrn that it
       has established a lawful basis for Sovrn to process reader data by
       means other than the Consent Framework through the “EU GDPR Reader
       Controls” settings within the account section of the platform.
       Publisher agrees that by making such setting choice it will only
       share with or make available to Sovrn Publisher Data Subject to and
       with all necessary permissions, consents and licenses from the
       respective individuals or third party suppliers from whom such data
       is to be collected in order to permit Sovrn to retain, use, and
       share with third parties the Publisher Data it receives under this
       Agreement from Publisher for any lawful purpose. Publisher further
       agrees that Publisher (i) will not provide to Sovrn any information
       in the nature of social security, credit card, financial account,
       credit report, or medical or health information, except as may be
       specifically requested to register a Publisher Account; (ii) will
       not provide Sovrn with Publisher Data from any device sending any
       “Limit Ad Tracking” or analogous device platform signal; and (iii)
       if applicable, will obtain Consent for Sovrn’s collection, use, and
       transfer of Precise Location Data for interest-based advertising
       purposes. For the purpose of this section, the terms “Precise
       Location Data” and “Consent” shall have the meanings defined in the
       DAA Self-Regulatory Principles. In addition, where required,
       Publisher will ensure that the Consent will meet the standards and
       requirements of the EU Privacy Laws.
   10. Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” of a disclosing party
       under this Agreement hereunder (“Discloser”) means all of the
       Discloser’s non-public information, including without limitation,
       the terms of this Agreement. The Sovrn Data is the Confidential
       Information of Sovrn. The Publisher Data is the Confidential
       Information of Publisher. Confidential Information of Discloser
       shall not be used by the other party hereto (“Recipient”) for any

       Recipient’s rights as contemplated hereunder, and Recipient will
       not otherwise at any time disclose the Confidential Information of
       Discloser to any third party without Discloser’s prior written
       consent. Recipient agrees that it shall treat all Confidential
       Information of Discloser with the same degree of care as it accords
       to its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than
       reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may
       disclose Confidential Information (i) to the extent required by law
       or (ii) to its employees, attorneys, accountants, banks and other
       financing sources and their advisors under an obligation of
       confidentiality.

       represents and warrants to the other party that (i) it holds all
       rights necessary to perform its obligations hereunder; (ii) all
       information provided by it to the other party is complete, correct

       applicable to Publisher that may prohibit Publisher from either (a)
       providing Publisher Data to Sovrn or (b) allowing Sovrn to utilize

       posted on any of your Publisher Sites and (b) you hold, and hereby
       grant to us, all rights necessary for us to perform our obligations
       hereunder.

       harmless the other party and its agents, affiliates and licensors
       from any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses

       with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, mobile and social
       media platform rules and policies, and the United States Digital
       Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles published
       at AboutAds (“DAA Self-Regulatory Principles”) including the
       corresponding DAA-designated self-regulatory frameworks established
       in other countries and/or regions. For avoidance of doubt,
       applicable laws will include the EU Directive on Privacy and
       Electronic Communications (2002/58/EC), any national laws
       implementing such Directives and/or, when applicable, the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), and any legislation or
       regulation amending, supplementing or any of the foregoing from
       time to time (together “EU Privacy Laws“) for any Publisher
       providing content to readers within the European Economic Area.
    8. Privacy Notice.  Publisher must maintain and comply with a privacy
       policy that provides notice of data collection, use, and transfer
       practices related to the Services, including without limitation,
       use of cookies or other tracking mechanisms and such privacy policy
       must comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and
       self-regulatory standards.  Publisher must comply with the enhanced
       notice obligations applicable to first parties under the DAA
       Self-Regulatory Principles including providing a link from the

       at AboutAds as applicable.
    9. Data Rights. Publisher agrees that at Sovrn’s discretion, Sovrn may
       use the Consent of the visitors to the site, including Consent
       provided under the specifications of the IAB Europe’s GDPR
       Transparency & Consent Framework described at AdvertisingConsent
       (the “Consent Framework”), as the lawful basis for collecting and
       processing the personal information of the visitors to the site,
       including the visitor’s pseudonymised cookie identifier. In the
       absence of such Consent, Publisher may indicate to Sovrn that it
       has established a lawful basis for Sovrn to process reader data by
       means other than the Consent Framework through the “EU GDPR Reader
       Controls” settings within the account section of the platform.
       Publisher agrees that by making such setting choice it will only
       share with or make available to Sovrn Publisher Data Subject to and
       with all necessary permissions, consents and licenses from the
       respective individuals or third party suppliers from whom such data
       is to be collected in order to permit Sovrn to retain, use, and
       share with third parties the Publisher Data it receives under this
       Agreement from Publisher for any lawful purpose. Publisher further
       agrees that Publisher (i) will not provide to Sovrn any information
       in the nature of social security, credit card, financial account,
       credit report, or medical or health information, except as may be
       specifically requested to register a Publisher Account; (ii) will
       not provide Sovrn with Publisher Data from any device sending any
       “Limit Ad Tracking” or analogous device platform signal; and (iii)
       if applicable, will obtain Consent for Sovrn’s collection, use, and
       transfer of Precise Location Data for interest-based advertising
       purposes. For the purpose of this section, the terms “Precise
       Location Data” and “Consent” shall have the meanings defined in the
       DAA Self-Regulatory Principles. In addition, where required,
       Publisher will ensure that the Consent will meet the standards and
       requirements of the EU Privacy Laws.
   10. Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” of a disclosing party
       under this Agreement hereunder (“Discloser”) means all of the
       Discloser’s non-public information, including without limitation,
       the terms of this Agreement. The Sovrn Data is the Confidential
       Information of Sovrn. The Publisher Data is the Confidential
       Information of Publisher. Confidential Information of Discloser
       shall not be used by the other party hereto (“Recipient”) for any
       purpose other than performing Recipient’s obligations or exercising
       Recipient’s rights as contemplated hereunder, and Recipient will
       not otherwise at any time disclose the Confidential Information of
       Discloser to any third party without Discloser’s prior written
       consent. Recipient agrees that it shall treat all Confidential
       Information of Discloser with the same degree of care as it accords
       to its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than
       reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may
       disclose Confidential Information (i) to the extent required by law
       or (ii) to its employees, attorneys, accountants, banks and other
       financing sources and their advisors under an obligation of
       confidentiality.
   11. Representations and Warranties. Each of Publisher and Sovrn
       represents and warrants to the other party that (i) it holds all
       rights necessary to perform its obligations hereunder; (ii) all
       information provided by it to the other party is complete, correct
       and current; and (iii) it will operate in accordance with all
       applicable privacy policies and all applicable laws, rules, and
       regulations, including without limitation, applicable privacy and
       data security laws, rules, and regulations (including, without
       limitation, with respect to use of all Publisher Data). Publisher
       further acknowledges that Publisher is solely responsible for being
       familiar and in compliance with any laws of any jurisdictions
       applicable to Publisher that may prohibit Publisher from either (a)
       providing Publisher Data to Sovrn or (b) allowing Sovrn to utilize
       the rights in the Publisher Data granted to it hereunder.
       Publisher represents, warrants, and covenants that the Publisher
       Sites are not directed to children under 13 years old and that no
       portion of the Publisher Data has been or will be collected in
       connection with any site, application, advertisement or other
       online service directed towards children under 13 years old. You
       further represent and warrant that (a) you own or are otherwise
       authorized to use, and are solely responsible for, the Content

       grant to us, all rights necessary for us to perform our obligations
       hereunder.
   12. Indemnification. Each party will indemnify, defend and hold
       harmless the other party and its agents, affiliates and licensors
       from any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
       arising from third-party claims or any government or industry
       investigation, including reasonable costs of investigation and
       reasonable attorneys’ fees (“Claims“) arising out of or related to
       breaches of this Agreement or allegations thereof.
   13. Changes to the Services; Changes to the Agreement. We are
       constantly changing and improving the Services. We may add or
       remove functionalities or features of the Services at any time, and
       we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. We may modify this
       Agreement or our Privacy Policy at any time, and will post any
       modifications to this Agreement on the homepage of our website at
       https://www.sovrn.com. Changes will not apply retroactively and
       generally will become effective 14 days after they are posted.
       However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or made for
       legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you don’t agree to
       any modified terms in the Agreement or our Privacy Policy, you must
       stop using the Services. Your continued use of the Services after
       the effective date of any changes constitutes your agreement to
       follow and be bound by such changes.
   14. Payments. We will pay you the applicable amounts determined by us
       for each Ad impression served on any of your Publisher Sites within
       60 days after the end of each month in which the Ad impressions
       were served, subject to our prior receipt of valid payment and tax
       information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount accrued
       for the applicable month is less than $25 (USD) or the equivalent
       amount in the currency of the country in which you reside, payment
       will be deferred until the month in which the cumulative balance
       owed to you exceeds $25 (USD) or the equivalent amount in the
       currency of the or the Agreement is terminated. We will have no
       obligation to make payments for any amounts that we, in our sole
       discretion, deem to have been generated from any Prohibited
       Activity (as defined below). We have the right to adjust payments
       for non-payment from advertisers. “Prohibited Activity” means
       engaging in any of the following: (i) Objectionable Activity; (ii)
       clicking on your own Ads or using any means (automated or manual)
       to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially or otherwise
       generate activity not driven by bona fide human intent; (iii)
       offering a user any inducement of any kind to generate clicks or
       impressions; (iv) installing ad code on or within 404/error message
       pages, pop-over/pop-under windows, downloadable applications,
       software, chat windows or email (v) obscuring an advertisement or
       any portion thereof with other content, advertising or navigational
       elements. The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to
       collaborate on the identification and elimination of any Prohibited
       Activity.
   15. Yield Fee.  The parties acknowledge and agree that in the event
       that all of your Header Bidding Ad Zones (as hereinafter defined)
       do not have a combined Yield (meaning the result of (i) Fill
       Rate (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by (ii) CPM (as
       hereinafter defined)) of at least $0.018 (“Minimum CPM”) in any
       calendar month during the Term, then Sovrn will charge you the
       difference between (i) ((1,000 Header Bidding Ad Requests (as
       hereinafter defined) in a calendar month) times (the Minimum
       Yield)) and (ii) total revenue earned by you from Sovrn and related
       solely to header bidding in such calendar month (“Minimum Yield
       Fee”).  If the Minimum Yield Fee for a calendar month is positive,
       then that amount shall be deducted from any amounts owed by Sovrn
       to you and if there are not sufficient amounts owed by Sovrn to
       you, then Sovrn will invoice you such remaining amount which amount
       will be due 30 days after the date of such invoice.  As used
       herein, the term “Fill Rate” shall mean impressions served for all
       Header Bidding Ad Zones divided by total Header
       Bidding Ad Requests (as hereinafter defined) for all Header Bidding
       Ad Zones and the result converted to a percentage.  As used herein,
       the term “Header Bidding Ad Zone” shall be the unique ID set forth
       in your Account for a specific header bidding Sovrn ad tag and
       shall be designated as “ID” and shall relate solely to header
       bidding.  As used herein, the term “Header Bidding Ad Requests”
       shall be the total header bidding requests received by Sovrn from
       you and shall be designated in your Account as “Requests” and shall
       relate to solely header bidding.  Finally, as used herein, the term
       “CPM” shall be the price paid per 1,000 impressions related solely
       to header bidding and shall be designated in your Account as “CPM”
       and shall be solely related to header bidding. In the event of any
       discrepancy exceeding 10% between the numbers reported by Us and
       the numbers reported by Publisher, We agree to resolve such
       discrepancy in good faith.
   16. Term; Termination. This Agreement shall remain in full force and
       effect while you use the Services or maintain an Account. Either
       party may terminate access to or use of any Service or all Services
       or your Account for any reason or no reason, effective by us upon
       sending notice to the e-mail address in your Account or by you upon

       ACCURACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

       OF SECTION 19 BELOW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO
       THE OTHER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR (i) ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY
       INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE
       DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (FOR ANY CAUSE
       WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), EVEN IF SUCH
       PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR (ii)
       ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (FOR ANY
       CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), IN
       EXCESS OF $1,000 OR THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN THE CURRENCY OF THE
       COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU RESIDE.

       no effect. This Agreement is accepted upon your use of the Services
       or by registering to have an Account. This Agreement (which
       includes our privacy policy and any other rules posted on our
       website) constitutes the entire agreement between you and us
       regarding the use of the Services and/or the Sovrn Data. Our

       this Agreement shall be sent via email (i) if to you, to the email
       address submitted by you with your Account, and (ii) if to us, to
