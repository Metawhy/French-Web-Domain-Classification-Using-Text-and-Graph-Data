   First, the video “Traffic Jams — and how to get rid of them:”

                                  Some details

   In the “car following” model, acceleration of each vehicle depends on
   distance and relative velocity of the leading vehicle.

   In the “bilateral control” model, acceleration of each vehicle depends
   on distance and relative velocity of the leading and
   (counterintuitively) the following vehicle.

   For additional online information click the following link: Suppressing
   traffic flow instabilities using bilateral control

   See also the “Bilateral Control” section of Liang Wang's web page
   (scroll down) and Car-following and Bilateral Control experiments.

   Below are some more illustrations of the “phantom traffic jam” as an
   “emergent property” of a string of dynamical systems under the “car
   following” model — and the suppression of these flow instabilities
   using “bilateral control.”
     __________________________________________________________________

(1) Car following:

   The red car in the middle applies the brakes briefly:

                             [carfollowing1.gif]

   Closeup of track near point of initial disturbance (red car):

                             [carfollowing3.gif]

   With “car following” control, disturbances move upstream (to the left)
   only, and increase in amplitude as they go.
   The disturbance near the initial cause dies down, but the wave
   travelling upstream does not —
   eventually forming a phantom traffic jam.
     __________________________________________________________________

(2) Bilateral control:

   The red car in the middle applies the brakes briefly:

                              [bilateral1.gif]

   Closeup of track near point of intial disturbance (red car):

                              [bilateral3.gif]

   With “bilateral” control, disturbances travel in both directions and
   decrease in amplitude.
   The system soon returns to smooth flow!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Shown in (1) and (2) above are sequences of initially equally spaced
   vehicles travelling at a common velocity
   (traffic flow is shown in a coordinate system moving along the track at
   the common initial velocity —
   so cars moving at that velocity appear stationary in the animations)

   The vehicle in the middle (marked in red) briefly applies the brakes
   hard.

   Two different control schemes are illustrated: (1) “car following” and
   (2) “bilateral control.”

   Positional feedback constant k[d]=0.2 (units: sec^-2) and velocity
   feedback constant k[v]=0.05 (units: sec^-1) in both (1) amd (2).
   Detailed behavior depends on these gains and other parameters, but the
   overall difference between the two control schemes is clear.
   (The animations are speeded up by a factor of 10).
     __________________________________________________________________

(3) A more complex situation:

   One minute of car following control — followed by bilateral control:

                              [combined_6.gif]

   Shown is a recording of a sample run of a simple simulator (download by
   clicking on the link) (*).
   The system starts out in a reasonable state, but “phantom traffic jams”
   start to form about 30 seconds in —
   even though all the cars are following standard “car following”
   protocol.
   The “bilateral control” algorithm is switched on at the one-minute
   mark.
   The phantom traffic jams soon clear up!
