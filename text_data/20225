   simple dashboard area. The world is your WordPress.

Easy to Learn

   Whether you are a professional developer or a complete novice in the
   world of websites and coding, WordPress has got you covered. Being the
   most popular CMS in the world, WordPress also comes with a never-ending
   supply of tutorials, walkthroughs, and development guides to make sure
   you are never left in the dark.

So Much More

   and themes, WordPress is the perfect playground for any domain owner

WordPress hosting: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   Answers to frequently asked questions about WordPress and WordPress
   hosting.

What is WordPress?

   WordPress is an open-source, sophisticated tool which can be installed
   on your web server to help you create your website, community, blog or
   a network. It is written in PHP and is widely considered as the
   simplest, yet the most efficient and powerful content management system
   (CMS) that exists today. WordPress is being used by many Fortune 500
   companies and other renowned blogs like TechCrunch and Mashable. With a
   multitude of free tutorials, themes, plugins, and extensions available,
   WordPress is equally beneficial for beginners and development experts.

What kind of website can I create on WordPress?

   WordPress initially started off as a blogging tool, but for a long
   time, it is being used to power some of the most complex ecommerce
   stores, communities, blogs, and networks. You can quite literally
   create any type of website on WordPress. Ranging from a personal
   informatory blog to an online business website, from a job board to a
   Q&A website, from portfolio websites to online communities, and from
   wiki websites to niche affiliate websites. 

How WordPress hosting is different from regular web hosting?

   What makes WordPress hosting differ from regular web hosting is
   efficiency, performance, and resources. Hostinger provides hosting
   packages that have been optimized for WordPress hosting. With our
   sophisticated platforms, you will have exciting features like WP-CLI,
   GIT and SSH integrated within your website. Installing WordPress on our
   hosting servers is literally just one click away. With pre-installed
   WordPress caching plugins, the speed and performance of your website
   will be just brilliant!

How to get started after purchasing Hostinger’s WordPress hosting?

   We don’t mean to boast, but unlike other web hosting compnaies, we make
   WordPress installation on Hostinger as easy as possible. It's just a
   mere click away. Yes – quite literally – you can use our 1-click
   installer to completely install WordPress on the hosting platform (with
   all necessary configurations) thorugh a single click and within
   moments. Once the installation is completed, you can use a link
   www.examplewebsite.com/wp-admin (just put your own domain name in
   there) to access the WordPress administrator area and get started.

Can I transfer my WordPress website that is hosted with a different provider
to Hostinger?

   Most definitely, yes! All it will take for you to migrate your
   WordPress webiste to Hostinger is one click! The whole migration
   process will be seamless, fast and you will not have to put any
   efforts. If, however, you are having difficulties or hurdles, all you
   have to do is contact our experienced and highly vetted customer
   success team. They will make sure to do everything possible to help you
   with the WordPress migration process and answer any queries you might
   have.

Is your WordPress version different from WordPress.org version?

   No, it isn’t. We, at Hostinger, are proud to always ensure to keep
   everything up to date. The same version that you can find at
   WordPress.org will be available to you on your hosting with Hostinger.
   Our users can enable automatic updates via the auto installer and have
   WordPress updated automatically every time a new version rolls out.
   There is absolutely no restrictions on our users; you are free to
   install as many themes and plugins as you want, customize your
   WordPress site however you desire and have the access to the core
   WordPress files as well.

Is Hostinger secure enough to host WordPress?

   We can very safely say that Hostinger is a very secure web hosting. We
   use BitNinja to secure our servers and it is a leading server security
   provider. It has state-of-the-art malware detection and removal
   features along with intrusion detection and protection against even the
   most sophisticated (D)DoS attacks. BitNinja’s collective intelligence
   capability also allows to gather and form a strong allegiance against
   any attacking force to all protected servers. Also, the usage of port
   and web honeypots play a huge part in preventing fatal attacks. In
   short, security should be the least of your concerns when you choose
   Hostinger.

Web hosting: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   Find answers to some frequently asked questions about web hosting:

What is web hosting?

   Every website that you visit consists of a domain name and a web host.
   The easiest way to picture it is to think of the domain name as the
   address and the web hosting as the physical building.

   When you’re browsing the web and you type in a URL (i.e.
   http://www.hostinger.com), your web browser basically queries that
   domain name (i.e. hostinger.com) and asks it where the website is
   hosted. The browser then loads up the contents that are stored there.

   Web hosting is effectively the process of using a server to host a
   website, and there are all sorts of different types of web hosting
   available out there on the market. Hostigner, just like most web hosts
   offer different packages so that their customers can pay for just the
   resources that they need. The more popular the website is, the more
   resources it’s likely to need to function effectively.

   The good news is that with Hostinger, you can scale your web hosting
   package as and when you need it, so you can start off with Single
   hosting plan and gradually upgrade to Business or even VPS plan later.

How does web hosting work?

   Your website is basically a collection of files and (in most cases)
   database that are served up to your visitors as they browse around it.
   Hostinger will allocate space for you to store your website and
   database.

   When you sign up Hostinger, you’ll receive login details to access your
   hosting account’s admin panel.

   At Hostinger, we offer custom built hosting control panel. Using our
   control panel you can carry out basic hosting management, monitor
   resource usage, create email addresses and install content management
   systems (CMSs) like WordPress. Note that this is different to the admin
   panel for your website, which will be created when you install a CMS.
   This is the admin panel for your server as a whole.

Are there different types of hosting services?

   Yes! Web hosting comes in all different shapes and sizes, with
   different setups suitable for different types of webmaster. In general
   hosting can be broken up into the following categories:

   Shared Hosting: This is usually the cheapest form of website hosting
   because it’s the most economical when it comes to the use of hardware.
   Shared hosting means that multiple different websites are all hosted on
   the same server, with each user being allocated a certain amount of
   storage space and a certain amount of resources. This is often the best
   option for hobbyists and bloggers.

   VPS Hosting: A virtual private server (VPS) setup is like a shared
   hosting setup on steroids. It generally uses more powerful hardware and
   takes its name from the fact that while multiple websites are being
   stored on the same physical hardware, each uses virtualisation software
   to allow them to operate independently as though they were dedicated
   mini-servers.

   Dedicated Hosting: Dedicated hosting is a good choice for the pros, and
   like its name suggests, it involves the use of a server that’s
   dedicated to a single website. In other words, unlike shared and VPS
   hosting, the user doesn’t have to share storage space and resources
   with other people and they have a physical piece of hardware all to
   themselves.

   Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting allows webmasters to tap into a large bank
   of servers that are all interlinked and designed to take over from each
   other if needed. In other words, if you need more resources, the cloud
   will provide more resources to rise to the demand. Cloud hosting is
   usually the best option if you want to aim for 100% uptime and don’t
   care how much you need to pay for it.

   Hostinger provides a mix of shared and cloud hosting. This setup allows
   us to provide fast website hosting with nearly 100% uptime at
   unbeatable price.

Do I need to have technical knowledge to use Hostinger hosting?

   Not at all! Hostinger makes it as easy as possible for novice users to
   pick up the basics as they go along. Many of the everyday tasks, such
   as setting up an email address or installing a content management
   system (CMS), can be done with just a few clicks and with no technical
   knowledge whatsoever.

   However, don’t let that fool you - while it’s easy to pick up the
   basics and get going, our hosting packages are also suitable for
   experienced developers. After all, there’s no reason why something
   can’t be both user-friendly and powerful at the same time.

   If you’re struggling, there’s no shortage of online guides to walk you
   through the most common tasks that you might want to carry out, and we
   also have a customer support team who’ll be more than happy to help if
   you get stuck. But for the majority of our customers, no help is needed
   - and if you just want to jump in and get started, it’s quicker and
   easier than signing up for a new social network.

What are the main differences between shared hosting and a VPS?

   Good question! A virtual private server (VPS) is a little bit like a
   cross between shared hosting and a dedicated server. It’s not quite the
   best of both worlds, but it is a good compromise and it can help you to
   keep costs down. Some people compare shared hosting to living in an
   apartment complex and VPS hosting to living in a condo.

   With shared hosting, you’re sharing a server and that server’s
   resources with a bunch of other websites. With a VPS, you’re still
   sharing some resources because that’s determined by the hardware, but
   the software itself is set up in such a way that one machine acts like
   multiple different servers, providing a different virtual server for
   every user.

   For webmasters, using a VPS means that they get the administrative
   power of a dedicated hosting setup, including the ability to customize
   their server to suit them.

   If you think VPS will be more suitable for you check out our cheap VPS
   hosting plans here.

How long does it take to set up a Hostinger hosting account?

   Not long at all! We’re proud of the fact that setup is instant. That
   means our new customers can get started straight away without delay.
   Just create your account and walk through the setup process and you’ll
   be ready to log in and to start managing your new hosting account
   immediately.

What kind of hosting do I need?

   That depends - what kind of website do you have? And what’s your
   budget?

   As a general rule, shared hosting is the best place to start, and
   Hostinger’s hosting is suitable for almost any kind of website. Our
   hosting helps you to keep the costs down during the early days of your
   website while allowing you to pay only for the resources that you need.
   If your website starts to take off, you can easily upgrade to higher
   tier plan and pick up some extra resources.

   Ultimately, every website is different. If you’re not sure, why not get
   in touch with our team so we can chat it through with you and make a
   personalized suggestion based on your needs?

What’s hosting bandwidth?

   You might already be familiar with the term ‘bandwidth’ from your
   broadband provider. At its most simple level, bandwidth is a term that
   refers to how much data can pass along an internet connection.

   When a user accesses your website, they send a request to the server
   and the server responds by literally serving up your website. Think of
   it as like turning on a tap. The more that people visit your website,
   the more water is flowing along the pipe, until you reach a point at
   which the pipe is full of water and it’s running at full capacity.

   The same idea applies to your website. If too many people are trying to
   access it at the same time, the pipe is filled up and the site starts
   to slow down and even to stop working altogether. And your hosting
   bandwidth is what determines the width of that pipe.

   While other hosting providers are limiting bandwidth, Hostinger offers
   truly unlimited bandwidth with Premium and Business hosting plans.

What’s a MySQL Database?

   MySQL is an open source database management system that uses structured
   query language (SQL) to access, add to and manage the content of a
   database. The fact that it’s an open source tool means that it’s a
   popular choice for software developers, which is why it forms the
   backbone of many of the most popular operating systems.

   Most modern content management system (such as WordPress) use it to
   store data. Every change that you make in the CMS is recorded in the
   MySQL database, and then every time a visitor arrives on the site, the
   content of that database is served up to them.

What’s an SSL certificate?

   An SSL certificate is a small data file that uses a cryptographic key
   to digitally tie your company’s identity with the files that are stored
   on your webserver. The idea is to prove the identity of the publisher
   of a webpage and to reduce the likelihood of a visitor accessing
   sensitive areas of a website without the appropriate security.

   When a website has been secured with an SSL certificate, a visitor will
   see a padlock icon in their web browser and they’ll be connected to the
   site using the https:// protocol. With the SSL certificate in place and
   the user accessing the site through https, the connection between the
   browser and the web server has been secured and sensitive information
   can safely be transferred.

   That’s why people use SSL certificates on e-commerce websites and other
   types of website that process credit card transactions and other
   financial information.

   We offer free SSL certificates with Premium and Business hosting plans.

How can I build a website?

   There are plenty of different ways to build a website, and it’s our
   goal to make it as easy as possible for you to do that. We want you to
   be able to sign up and start building your website straight away with
   no delay, which is why we’ve put a lot of time into streamlining it
   all.

   If you just want to get started, the best option is usually to use our
   auto installer to install a content management system (CMS) which you
   can customize to suit your needs, whether you’re setting up a blog or
   whether you’re creating a website for your business. With a CMS, you
   can create new pages and customize the look and feel of your site
   without any technical know-how or programming ability.

   Many webmasters use WordPress which is the most widely-used CMS in the
   world. All our hosting plans are fully optimized for WordPress.

   But if WordPress doesn’t take your fancy, don’t worry. We also offer an
   intuitive drag and drop website builder that’s designed to get your
   site live in five minutes with no coding and no technical knowledge
   needed. You can find out more about that right here.

Will I get a free domain name?

   Yes! We make it easy for you to get going by offering a free domain
   name when you sign up for an annual plan. We also offer some of the
   lowest prices on the market so that you can set up your website without
   spending a small fortune.

Can I transfer my website to Hostinger?

   Yes - and we actively encourage it! If you’re using one of the more
   common CMS platforms such as WordPress then there are plenty of tools
   available to make it easy to export from one host and to import into
   another. But if you’re not using a common CMS - or if you need a little
   help along the way - then just let us know. Our staff will do
   everything they can to help you to make the transfer - and we’ll do it
   free of charge!!

Will Hostinger help me to create my website?

   Well that depends!

   We’ll certainly do everything we can to lend a helping hand, whether
   that’s by pointing you in the right direction or by troubleshooting
   errors and issues. We also have a large knowledge base that’s filled
   with answers to existing questions, as well as a range of tutorials
   which were written with new customers in mind to help them to get
   started and to make the most of their Hostinger plan.

   That said, we’re hosting specialists - which means that while we’ll
   offer as much help and support as we can, we’re not able to build you a
   website from scratch. But don’t worry about it - thanks to our website
   builder and our auto installers, you won’t have a problem.

Can I buy Hosting without a domain name?

   Yes, you can. If you want to, you can purchase domain names from
   elsewhere and point it to your server with Hostinger. If you want to
   keep your domain name and your website hosting together under a single
   provider — which we’d recommend for convenience and easier
   troubleshooting — then you can also transfer an existing domain name to
   Hostinger. Just get in touch and let us know!

Can I upgrade my hosting plan as my website grows?

   Yes! In fact, this is usually what we recommend, and it’s one of the
   benefits of choosing Hostinger as your hosting provider. We make the
   upgrade procedure as simple as possible so that you can start on our
   budget plans and upgrade as your website starts to take off. We’re
   there alongside you at all times and we’re ready to grow with you!

   Many other hosting providers will try to talk you into taking out plans
   that you neither need nor want. We disagree with that. We believe you
   should pay only for the resources that you need.

How can I be sure Hostinger hosting is secure?

   We take security very seriously because there’s no point having a
   website if you can’t be sure that it’s safe from attack. We use
   BitNinja to protect all of our users, and we go out of our way to
   ensure that our servers are as strong and secure as possible. This
   includes running advanced , custom built security software and
   regularly updating our infrastructure.

Can I install and run an ecommerce site on Hostinger hosting?

   Of course! We’re all about helping our customers to get their
   businesses off the ground, and that means that we support e-commerce
   sites on any of our plans. You can also take advantage of our
   auto-installers to set up a range of content management systems (CMS)
   and e-commerce platforms.

What kind of support will I get?

   Here at Hostinger, we pride ourselves on our support team. In fact, we
   call our support team our customer success team, because we go the
   extra mile to make sure that our customers are as successful as
   possible. If you have a problem, no matter what it is, then get in
   touch with us. We’ll do our best to fix it if it’s something that’s
   under control, and even if not, we’ll try to point you in the right
   direction.

   a long track record of doing everything in our power to help our
   customers. We respond quickly and thoroughly and don’t give up until
   we’ve found a solution. So if you’re having a problem, get in touch!

What is the architecture of Hostinger Cloud Hosting?

   At Hostinger , we use cloudlinux with LVE containers. Each account gets
   a dedicated container and is served from there. Each container has
   resource boundaries to make sure the host stays healthy at all times
   (even if, one of the accounts is under a DDoS attack). In case the host
   needs to be put down, the account with its container can be easily
   migrated to a different host, to avoid unnecessary downtime. Our shared
   hosting accounts share hosts between several customers, whereas our
   cloud hosting clients are served solely from the host, meaning that
   only their accounts are put in the whole host.

Can I upgrade from shared hosting to Cloud Hosting?

   If you have a shared web hosting plan on Hostinger, upgrading to cloud
   hosting is extremely simple. All you have to do is order an upgrade
   from the control panel, and everything will be migrated automatically!

   The main difference between two is that cloud hosting plan provides you
   with dedicated resources and the ability to manage them as you see fit.
   Meanwhile shared hosting typically hosts multiple servers on one
   dedicated machine and requires the user to share resources with other
   servers on the machine.

How many websites can I host with a Cloud Hosting package?

   Cloud Hosting has no limit on the amount of websites you can host. You
   can add as many as you need as long as you have the resources. And if
   you ever need more, we got your back!

What if I need assistance?

   Since cloud hosting is fully managed, you’ll have a dedicated support
   team ready to help with all your needs 24/7/365.
