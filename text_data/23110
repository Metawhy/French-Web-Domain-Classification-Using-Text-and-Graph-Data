Do universal owners vote to curb negative corporate externalities? An
empirical analysis of shareholder meetings

   This paper tests whether very diversified and patient investors, also
   known as universal owners, tend to vote in favor of shareholder
   resolutions instructing corporations to reduce or communicate on the
   negative externalities they produce. Our sample includes 213 US fund
   families that voted on 13,108 different shareholder resolutions at
   2,352 companies over the period from 2013 to 2016. We find that,
   contrary to the common ownership logic, universal owners’ support for
   issues related to externalities is lower than the one of otherwise
   similar fund families. Instead, support is positively associated with
   the proportion of socially responsible investment funds in the family.
   We discuss various practical implications of our results.

Italian politics take centre stage

   Political crisis and possible scenarios: The Deputy PM Matteo Salvini
   recently withdrew his party’s support to the coalition government
   headed by PM Giuseppe Conte, calling for a vote of no-confidence
   against the PM and subsequent snap elections.  On the 20th of August,
   after addressing the Senate, PM Conte resigned. President Sergio
   Mattarella will now weigh three options – consult political parties to
   form a new government (with the same forces of the current coalition or
   new ones), appoint a caretaker government or call for fresh elections.

   Argentina: how recent events shape the investment outlook

Argentina: how recent events shape the investment outlook

   Recent update on Argentina: Government’s decision to freeze energy
   prices and suspend VAT on certain products will complicate fiscal
   metrics. The country is likely to miss the IMF target of a primary
   balance for 2019. However, the IMF could disburse the September tranche
   of financial assistance, although conviction levels are low.

Do universal owners vote to curb negative corporate externalities? An
empirical analysis of shareholder meetings

   This paper tests whether very diversified and patient investors, also
   known as universal owners, tend to vote in favor of shareholder
   resolutions instructing corporations to reduce or communicate on the
   negative externalities they produce. Our sample includes 213 US fund
   families that voted on 13,108 different shareholder resolutions at
   2,352 companies over the period from 2013 to 2016. We find that,
   contrary to the common ownership logic, universal owners’ support for
   issues related to externalities is lower than the one of otherwise
   similar fund families. Instead, support is positively associated with
   the proportion of socially responsible investment funds in the family.
   We discuss various practical implications of our results.

Italian politics take centre stage

   Political crisis and possible scenarios: The Deputy PM Matteo Salvini
   recently withdrew his party’s support to the coalition government
   headed by PM Giuseppe Conte, calling for a vote of no-confidence
   against the PM and subsequent snap elections.  On the 20th of August,
   after addressing the Senate, PM Conte resigned. President Sergio
   Mattarella will now weigh three options – consult political parties to
   form a new government (with the same forces of the current coalition or
   new ones), appoint a caretaker government or call for fresh elections.

   Argentina: how recent events shape the investment outlook

Argentina: how recent events shape the investment outlook

   Recent update on Argentina: Government’s decision to freeze energy
   prices and suspend VAT on certain products will complicate fiscal
   metrics. The country is likely to miss the IMF target of a primary
   balance for 2019. However, the IMF could disburse the September tranche
   of financial assistance, although conviction levels are low.
