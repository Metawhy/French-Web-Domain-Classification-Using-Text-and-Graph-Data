Hertz in Almeria

   Located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Almería is home to
   stretches of soft beaches and beautiful coastline. This part of
   southern Spain is known for its desert landscape that has provided the
   backdrop for many Spaghetti Western films. There’s also no shortage of
   things to see in the port city itself, including its remarkable Moorish
   fortress, Alcazaba.

   Almería is not a traditional tourist hotspot, so it’s a great place to
   explore if you’re looking for a city break with a difference. Car
   rental in Almería makes it possible to see not only all the city has to
   offer, but also the Tabernas Desert and the lost gold mines of
   Rodalquilar, as well as the region’s bounty of beaches. You’ll find our
   Hertz car rental center located at Almería airport, just a few miles
   out of the center, so you can collect your vehicle at the very start of
   your visit if you’re flying in from overseas.

Driving in and around Almería

   Almeria

   Our car rental center at Almería Airport is just a short drive from the
   city center, less than 6 miles via the AL-12. If you’re staying in
   Almería, you’ll also find that the resort is a great base for exploring
   the rest of the Andalusian region including the nearby Cabo de Gata
   marine park, under an hour’s drive away along the AL-3115. Here you’ll
   find a fascinating, varied landscape with hidden coves, idyllic bays
   and volcanic rock formations. Some areas of the park have limited road
   access.

   Almería offers easy access to the Tabernas Desert, just 30 minutes or
   so away via the A-92. This road also connects the city with Seville,
   around a four hour drive to the west. There’s also the opportunity to
   take a scenic drive along the coast to some of the region’s beaches,
   including those at Pulpí, which boast honeyed sands, steep cliffs and
   tempting azure waters.

   It’s worth familiarizing yourself with the rules for driving in Spain
   before your visit to Almería. As in the US and most of mainland Europe,
   the Spanish drive on the right hand side of the road. The speed limit
   for cars on freeways is 120 km/h (75 mph) and, in built-up areas, the
   maximum speed is 50 km/h (30 mph), unless there are signs stating
   otherwise. The Spanish government has recently introduced some
   stretches with limits as high as 130km/h (81 mph) and as low as 20 km/h
   (12 mph), but these will be clearly signposted.

   Freeways in Spain often include tollbooths, like many other countries
   in central Europe, but there will be signs that clearly show when
   you’re approaching one. Our pick-up location team will be delighted to
   answer any questions you may have about paying for these. Spain has
   laws that state seatbelts must be worn at all times and strictly forbid
   the use of phones while driving, even if the car is stationary.

A quick guide to Almería

   Almeria

   With its prime location in sunny southern Spain, Almería combines
   fascinating historical sites with beautiful beaches and plenty more
   besides. There’s even a ferry port from where you can take an exciting
   trip to North Africa. Almería is a great base for exploring Andalusia,
   so that you can combine the contrasts of the coast and the desert
   during your stay.

The highlights of history

   If you’re visiting the center of Almería, you’ll find a number of
   enthralling sites to dive into. One of the most impressive is the
   Catedral de la Encarnacion, with its imposing towers and parapets. The
   building combines Gothic and Renaissance influences and was built on
   the former site of a mosque destroyed by an earthquake in the 16^th
   century.

   Climb the narrow streets to the west of the cathedral and you’ll reach
   perhaps the most famous attraction in Almería, the Alcazaba. This
   ancient fortress was built in the 10th century by the region’s Muslim
   rulers. A former royal residence with three walled enclosures called
   recintos, it dominates the skyline and can be seen from anywhere in the
   city. Head inside to see the varied residential, palace and battlement
   areas.

   On a hilltop close to the Alcazaba, you’ll come across the Castillo de
   San Cristobal. Built in the 12^th century as a military fortress, today
   the structure lies in ruins and is protected as a special historic site
   under Spanish law. Entry is free and it’s a brilliant place to learn
   all about Almería’s past.

A taste of Hollywood

   Not far from the city center, just a short drive up the A-92, you’ll
   find the Tabernas Desert. This vast landscape, with its striking
   similarity to the Wild West, has been the setting for a number of
   movies, from Lawrence of Arabia to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

   Today, the desert is a protected national park and popular tourist
   hotspot, thanks to the many Western villages that were built for
   filming here. One of the best-preserved sets can be found at Fort
   Bravo, created for Sergio Leone’s classic The Good, The Bad and The
   Ugly in 1966. Film fans might also want to visit Los Albaricoques, a
   real village used as a location in several movies.

The lure of the coast

   If you head east out of the city, you’ll find the maritime park Cabo de
   Gata. Filled with beautiful areas of untouched natural coastline with
   volcanic origins, you’ll find idyllic bays and serene water perfect for
   a swim. Dotted along the coast are many charming little fishing
   villages and cliffs with excellent views of the Mediterranean and
   surrounding areas.

   Summer is the most popular time to visit this area but those who are
   planning a long hike might find it more comfortable in the cooler
   months. Venturing along the coast takes you to sites including the
   former gold mining village of Rodalquilar, now home to serene botanical
   gardens, and the lighthouse at Torre de los Lobos, with its gorgeous
   views. All of these places are on your doorstep with car rental in
   Almería

Driving in and around Las Palmas

   With the cool sea breeze blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean, the warm
   sun beating down and the mountainous backdrop, Las Palmas is truly a
   wonderful destination to drive around.

   The GC-1 runs along the east side of Las Palmas, providing access to
   the Naval Museum, Poema De Mar Aquarium and Castillo de la Luz, a
   16th-century fortress. Vegueta, the atmospheric old quarter of the
   city, can also be reached via the GC-1 or GC-5.

   There are several parking lots in the city for you to use if you wish
   to leave your vehicle behind and head to Playa De Las Canteras, a
   nearly two-mile stretch of beach.

   Situated in the north-east of Gran Canaria, the capital is
   well-connected to the rest of the island. The GC-1 and GC-2 snake out
   along the coastline in opposite directions, while the GC-23 will take
   you inland.

   At just 30 miles long, it’s easy to see the whole of Gran Canaria in a
   day if you wish. The GC-1 freeway runs along the eastern and southern
   fringe of the island, taking less than an hour to reach the lively
   Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria at the bottom of the island.

   Although this main road ensures the city is well connected to the rest
   of the island, it’s worth taking the winding mountain roads. You’ll see
   quaint villages and phenomenal scenery, with views that stretch right
   out to Tenerife.

   Take the GC-15 and it’s an hour’s drive to the highest lookout point in
   Gran Canaria, right in the center of the island at Pico de las Nieves.
   Take the GC-2 west and just before you reach Barranco de Guayedra on
   the edge of Tamadaba Natural Park, you’ll find Finca Los Castaños, the
   only coffee plantation in Europe.

   Here you can learn how the beans are carefully harvested and roasted to
   perfection before enjoying a cup yourself.

   Driving in Gran Canaria is much the same as driving in mainland Spain.
   You’ll use the left-hand side of the road and all passengers must wear
   seatbelts.

   Speed limits are clearly signposted and are shown in kilometers. In
   cities and built-up areas, the limit is 31mph or lower, rising to 55mph
   on smaller roads, 62mph on main routes and 74mph on highways.

   There are several toll roads in Spain – look out for signs saying
   ‘Peaje’. Our staff will be happy to answer any questions you have about
   driving in Spain.

A quick guide to Las Palmas

   The energy of this city is palpable, from the flourishing port to the
   bustling cafes and lively plazas. Once you’ve explored Las Palmas, you
   can head out to discover the winding mountain roads and stunning
   coastline of Gran Canaria.

Wander through the old quarter

   Admire the mesmerizing blend of architecture as you stroll through the
   cobblestone streets of Las Palmas’ atmospheric old quarter Vegueta,
   which dates back to the 15th century.

   The Gothic grey-tinged façade of Santa Ana Cathedral stands out among
   the old churches and rows of houses, complete with wooden balconies.
   Its towers are landmarks of the city – ride the elevator all the way to
   the top of the bell tower and enjoy sweeping views across the city and
   out towards the coast.

   After exploring the maze of streets, while away a few hours in one of
   the squares, dining alfresco and blissfully watching the world go by.
   In Plaza de Santa Ana you’ll find eight bronze guard dogs watching over
   the square and at Plaza de Santo Domingo you can enjoy the tinkling
   soundtrack of an 18th century fountain.

Explore 40 miles of coastline

   Golden shores,lapped by warm turquoise sea, fringe Gran Canaria. But
   you don’t have to stray too far to enjoy the beach in Las Palmas, with
   Playa de las Canteras and Playa de las Alcaravaneras found within the
   city. Three-mile long Las Canteras is arguably the island’s best beach
   and one of the top urban beaches in Europe.

   On the opposite side of the island you'll find Puerto Rico de Gran
   Canaria, which boasts more hours of sunshine than any other part of
   Gran Canaria. Renowned for its beautiful beaches, this is the perfect
   spot to try out water sports such as jet skiing, parasailing and
   windsurfing.

   Once you’ve experienced the thrill of the waters, speed out to sea
   aboard a glass-bottomed boat to catch a glimpse of local marine life,
   such as colorful schools of fish and pods of dolphins.

   While you’re in the south part of the island, make sure you visit the
   Maspalomas Dunes, an enormous, other-worldly nature reserve that’ll
   make you feel like you’ve stumbled across a slice of desert. Make your
   way through the sand dunes to Maspalomas Beach where you can take a dip
   in the refreshing waters.

Take a hike

   Spending a morning hiking is one of the best ways to experience Gran
   Canaria’s diverse landscapes. In Las Palmas itself, you can wander
   along Playa El Confital, a serene surf spot with a long promenade that
   snakes around the south-west part of La Isleta.

   To conquer the highest point of the island, right in the center of Gran
   Canaria, head to Pico de las Nieves. At nearly 2,000 meters above sea
   level, the views from this vantage point are breathtaking.

   You'll find a stone semi-circle next to the car park that directs you
   towards uninterrupted views of the sunset. Aim to be here in the early
   evening and you’ll be able to see across the island’s peaks and across
   to Tenerife.

   Car rental in Las Palmas will give you the freedom to explore every
   corner of the city and the rest of Gran Canaria – all at your own
   pace.

Driving in and around Bari

   Bari

   Bari isn’t just a fantastic place in its own right, it’s also an ideal
   location if you want to explore the hidden gems of southern Italy by
   car, especially in an area where public transport can be unreliable.

   The SS16 loops around the city, providing access to the suburbs. The
   Corso Vittorio Veneto snakes along the waterfront and takes you into
   the historic part of Bari. Make use of the parking lot just beyond
   Castello Normanno-Svevo, as the tight streets around here make it
   easier to explore the main sights on foot. While the old town is a
   souk-style warren of cobblestone lanes, the adjacent modern city was
   meticulously planned and is much easier to navigate as a driver.

   Polignano a Mare is a 40-minute drive down the coast via the SS16. The
   town itself is perched dramatically on a cliff high above the sparkling
   blue sea, but there’s also a number of beaches here too, made for
   sun-seekers.

   UNESCO-listed Alberobello is also under an hour away along the SS100
   and SS172. This storybook town is like nothing you’ve ever seen before
   with its clutch of cone-shaped houses called ‘trulli’.

   Historic Lecce is less than a two-hour drive away on the southbound
   SS16, SS379 and SS613. If you’ve got time to make this day trip, it’s
   worth it to see the city’s hoard of unique baroque architecture.

   Vehicles travel on the right-hand side of the road in Italy, as back
   home. The Italian speed limit is typically 130km/h (80mph) for major
   freeways known as autostrade, and 50km/h (30mph) in urban areas, but
   always check signs as these can vary. Seat belts must be worn by the
   driver and all passengers.

A quick guide to Bari

   Bari

   Experience a different side of Italy when you visit Bari and
   surrounding Puglia. Rome may have a goldmine of history, Florence a
   wealth of treasured art and Bologna world-famous cuisine, but this
   region has all three – and more. It’s time to discover Italy’s best
   kept secret.

Bari’s historic heart

   Wandering along the charming, winding alleyways of Bari’s old town,
   you’ll find plenty of cafes and restaurants that serve up the city’s
   specialty – seafood. Paglionico Vini e Cucina is one of the best – and
   oldest – taverns to dine at. There’s no menu to flick through – simply
   order your pick of what’s being served up that day, such as fried
   calamari, grilled octopus and shrimp pasta, in a place that has been
   popular with locals since 1870.

   Make time to pay a visit to the Basilica di San Nicola. This
   Norman-style church was built in the 12th century as a home for the
   remains of Saint Nicholas, which were stolen from Turkey in the 11th
   century by Barese merchants. He’s better known today as the origin of
   Father Christmas.

   Castello Normanno-Svevo is another stop to make while in Bari.
   Overlooking the Adriatic Sea, it was built in the 12th century to
   protect the city and its mighty bastions and thick walls still stand
   today.

Beyond Bari

   Alberobello is a day tripper favorite due to its unique ‘trulli’ homes.
   Don’t forget your camera – the architecture is remarkable, with
   whitewash limestone walls and conical roofs painted with various
   symbols.

   Lecce attracts visitors all-year-round, thanks in part to its beautiful
   baroque architecture. Flamboyant churches and palaces appear as you
   wander the labyrinth of medieval passageways. Basilica di Santa Croce
   is one of its finest examples, with a breathtaking sculpted façade that
   took 100 years to create. Lecce is also a foodie paradise Come here to
   sample Pugliese cuisine at its finest, with trattorias serving up
   dishes ranging from broad bean purée with braised wild chicory to
   shrimp risotto.

Beach hopping near Bari

   Bari’s coastal location means there’s a wealth of nearby beaches to
   discover. Pop towels, a picnic and bucket and spades into the trunk of
   your rental car and set off to explore the Adriatic coast.

   On the eastern edge of Bari is Pane e Pomodoro Beach, meaning you don’t
   need to travel far from the city to bask in the sunshine.

   If you’ve got time to go further afield, Cala Porto Beach in Polignano
   a Mare is a real beauty. It’s found in the heart of the town, where
   small white pebbles form the shoreline, fringed with blue-green waters
   and surrounded by dramatic hilltop buildings. Just down the coast is
   Lido Santo Stefano, another sun kissed sandy bay with beautiful green
   waters – perfect for swimming and snorkeling.

   With car rental in Bari, you can enjoy a feast of culture on vacation
   in this sensation slice of Italy. Start your Puglia journey in style –
   you’ll want to come back again and again.

Driving in and around Bergamo

   Cleaved into two districts, Bergamo is spread between a warren of
   medieval streets enclosed by Venetian walls, and the beautiful
   architecture of the lower town. It’s well connected by a network of
   roads, making it straightforward to drive both in and around it. The
   SS470, SS42 and SP342 will take you out to the surrounding cities and
   the airport, which is just over three miles from the center.

   Situated in the far north of Italy, the city is just a short distance
   from the border with Switzerland bordering the towering snow-capped
   Alps - and in range of some ofthe best ski resorts in Italy. There are
   several snowy destinations to choose from within just a few hours of
   Bergamo, including 21km of slopes at the Presolana Monte Pora ski
   resort.

   The glamorous streets and bright lights of Milan are also within easy
   reach. Around an hour away via the E64 and A51, Milan is home to two of
   the country’s most famous soccer teams and hosts the superb Milan
   Fashion Week, bringing style from across the world to a city which
   prides itself on its fashion credentials.

   When exploring Lombardy, be aware that many of the major routes in
   Italy do have tolls. Unless signposted otherwise, speed limits vary
   from 80 mph on Italian freeways to 56 mph on local roads and 30 mph in
   cities, towns and villages. Like most of Europe, they drive on the
   right-hand side of the road and, as a major town, there is a limited
   traffic zone in place in Bergamo, which allows only residents to drive
   in specific areas - so keep an eye out and make sure you stay on the
   right roads to avoid a fine.

A quick guide to Bergamo

   One of northern Italy’s most captivating cities, Bergamo is a
   sometimes-overlooked gem of the Lombardy region. Don’t make that
   mistake. Once you’ve explored its historic streets, head out to
   discover the wider region, from the Alps to Italy’s lush agricultural
   heartland in Po Valley.

Medieval meandering

   Bergamo was part of the Republic of Venice from the early 15th century
   for nearly 400 years. To this day, the ancient hilltop Citta Alta - or
   Upper Town - is still surrounded by three miles of Venetian Walls and
   overlooks the modern Citta Bassa – the Lower Town.

   Park up and take the funicular, which has connected the two districts
   for more than 100 years and affords stunning views across the city.
   When you arrive in the upper town, meander along the pretty cobblestone
   streets until you reach the center at the aristocratic Piazza Vecchia.
   Take a seat at one of the many trattoria and admire the 800-year-old
   Palazzo della Ragione at the very heart of Bergamo. At the centrer of
   the square you’ll find Contarini Fountain and, on the opposite side,
   Palazzo Nuovo. Take a seat, sip an espresso and watch the gentle buzz
   of Bergamo life go by.

Riches of the Renaissance

   There’s a wealth of art to discover in Bergamo. Visit Accademia Carrara
   and you’ll find Renaissance masterpieces from the likes of Botticelli,
   Mantegna, Bellini and Raphael. With everything from depictions of
   saints and classical landscapes to explorations of love, the museum
   depicts the development of a movement that changed art forever.

   Bergamo is also the birthplace of Donizetti, one of the world's
   greatest opera composers, and his influence is still very much felt and
   celebrated here. Visit his house in the upper town and sift through his
   most personal items - letters, scores, portraits - in the Donizetti
   Museum. His ornate tomb can still be seen in Basilica di Santa Maria
   Maggiore.

   The 200-year-old theater, which was named in his honor, still regularly
   stages some of his most popular operas, and statues of composers
   guarding the entrance and a frescoed auditorium ceiling show the
   opulence of 19th century Italian opera houses.

Hike the Bergamo Alps

   Peaks, valleys, and forests are dotted with farms and villages inthe
   nearby Alps. This vast and imposing mountain range is 50 miles long,
   with soaring summits up to more than 3,000 meters. Stretch your legs as
   you follow one of the many footpaths and breathe in the fresh air. The
   scenery is always changing, becoming wilder and more dramatic as you
   head towards the highest peaks.

   Make sure you stop to see the impressive Serio Waterfalls. At 315
   meters they’re the highest in Italy, sending cascades of foaming white
   water into a towering Alpine gorge. The trail there will take around an
   hour and a half and, if you journey on, you’ll come to Rifugio Curo, a
   mountain refuge overlooking a turquoise pool, which contrasts
   gorgeously with the dark green mountains in the distance.

Dine on hearty local cuisine

   Italian cities are renowned for their mouth-watering food and Bergamo
   is no different.Make your way to the Upper Town for some of the best
   restaurants and eat your fill of delicious fresh produce against a
   stunning backdrop.Much of Italian life revolves around food, so make
   time to eat and enjoy.

   Pork, particularly salami, is popular here as well as Alpine cheeses
   like taleggio. Tuck into a steaming bowl of casoncelli, stuffed pasta
   served in simple but rich sauce of melted butter and sage, one of the
   most famous local dishes.

   Collect your car rental from Bergamo and soak up the atmosphere of this
   beautiful city as well as heading out into the diverse landscape of
   Lombardy to experience everything northern Italy has to tempt you with.

Hertz in New Mexico

   To describe New Mexico as scenic simply doesn't do the state justice.
   The place is referred to as the Land of Enchantment due to its pristine
   southwestern beauty that's apparent with every turn of the steering
   wheel. While there are cities to explore, such as Santa Fe and
   Albuquerque, travelers can also hop in a New Mexico rental car any time
   to hit the road and take in all the stunning desert landscapes and
   mountainous terrain that makes the state so remarkable. A great
   historical destination for anyone curious about the origins of the area
   will need to visit Aztec, New Mexico, home of the Aztec Ruins National
   Monument.

   There's also Chaco Culture National Historical Park, located between
   San Juan County and McKinley County. Prepare yourself for astonishment
   as you make your way through ancient homes that are still standing. If
   you’re out for a relaxing drive, swing your rental car to one of the
   more acclaimed areas of tranquility in the state: the Ojo Caliente
   Mineral Springs Resort & Spa, where the ultimate relaxation getaway
   begins with professional massage sessions or dips in the soothing
   springs. To receive some stress-alleviating treatment The Gila Cliff
   Dwellings just outside Silver City is where you'll find the
   Lightfeather Hot Springs, nature's own hot tub.

   Anyone curious about the question of extraterrestrial existence needs
   to spend a day driving through Roswell. Take your New Mexico rental car
   down U.S. Route 66, where you can experience the most alien-obsessed
   town in the entire country. UFO sightings are a thing of the norm here,
   with the famous 1947 Roswell UFO Incident remaining one of the more
   talked-about occurrences in the region. Stop at the Roswell UFO Museum,
   where you can learn all about the incident. Even if aliens aren't your
   fancy, Roswell is also home to the stunning Bitter Lake National
   Wildlife Refuge.
