   The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)
   study is one of the largest cohort studies in the world, with more than
   half a million (521 000) participants recruited across 10 European
   countries and followed for almost 15 years.
   EPIC was designed to investigate the relationships between diet,
   nutritional status, lifestyle and environmental factors, and the
   incidence of cancer and other chronic diseases. EPIC investigators are
   active in all fields of epidemiology, and important contributions have
   been made in nutritional epidemiology using biomarker analysis and
   questionnaire information, as well as genetic and lifestyle
   investigations. For details about research activities within EPIC,
   please refer to the Research and Highlights sections.
   The EPIC study is jointly coordinated by Professor Elio Riboli,
   Director of the School of Public Health at Imperial College London,
   United Kingdom, and Dr Marc Gunter and Dr Paul Brennan at the
   International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France.
