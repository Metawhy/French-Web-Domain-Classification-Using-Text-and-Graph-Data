daughters

   Unless a man looks to Jesus, a man doesn’t know how to treat a woman.
   [161b7982d61bf950fa2e3265d8d12f9f.jpg]
   When the prevailing thinking is boys will be boys — girls will be
   garbage.
   And that is never the heart of God.
   Real Manhood knows the heart of God for the daughters of His heart.
   This is what God chose as best, this is where He first became one of
   us: God chose to make His entry point into the world through the holy
   space of a woman, to enfold Himself inside of a woman, to drink of a
   woman, be held and nourished and cared for by a woman — that’s the
   jolting truth of how God loves His daughters with His honor.
   That Christ never beat down a woman with harsh words or lusting eyes or
   sneering innuendos, but He stepped in and stopped a broken woman from
   the abuse of angry men. Christ came to the defense of a hurting woman
   and the Son of Man stood between her ache and her attackers and He
   lifted the weight of shame from her and cupped her heart with hope and
   wrote a new future into the dust and dirt of everything and he saved.
   her. life. That’s how God loves His daughters with His defense.
   That Christ didn’t degrade women in His talk, but He made women heroes
   in His stories. He invited a woman with a coin and broom to reveal the
   truth about the Kingdom of God. He honored an intentional woman with an
   unjust judge as unveiling the character of God. He elevated a lonely,
   unmarried woman who dropped her meager resources into the temple
   treasury as the rebuke of God for all the rich and religious. That’s
   how God loves His daughters with His words.
   That Christ didn’t demonize women but He accepted the presence of a
   woman reviled by the self-righteous, He sat with the scandalous woman
   the righteous regarded as damaged goods, He welcomed the rejected and
   the immodest though he lost the respect of the religious. That’s how
   God loves His daughter with His grace.
   That when Christ stepped out of that black tomb, he still didn’t choose
   to first manifest Himself to prestigious officials, religious leaders,
   the Twelve, but instead He revealed Himself first to the women, He
   entrusted the veracity of His resurrection to the testimony of the
   women, He offered the privilege of proclaiming Christ as the risen
   Savior to the women, though no court at the time would accept their
   testimony. That’s how God loves His daughters with His regard.
   When you turn the pages of the Bible, let everything you read of women
   be shaped by how Jesus sealed His view and value of women.
   Let Christ shape you and not the magazine covers of the Walmart
   checkout: Real Manhood never objectifies women. Real Manhood edifies
   women.
   Real Manhood means you don’t get drunk, and a man can get drunk on a
   lot more than alcohol.
   Men drunk on power, on control, on ego, lose more than all inhibition —
   they lose The Way, their own souls. Men drunk on anything can destroy
   everything and real manhood thirsts for righteousness.
   Real Manhood means peer pressure only makes you stronger in Christ.
   That in a culture where it’s the tendency to bend, you’ll stand. That
   in situations where there’s tendency to look the other way, you’ll look
   for help. That, at times in the church when there’s a tendency to be
   divisive on the secondary and a unified front of silence on the
   painful, you’ll seek to rightly divide the truth and unify the
   brokenhearted.
   Because if Christ is The Truth — then where there isn’t Truth, there
   isn’t Christ. Why ever be afraid of the Truth?
   Because if you’re at peace in Christ, you fight injustice.
   Real Manhood means you take responsibility for your body.
   A woman’s immodesty is never an excuse for a man’s irresponsibility.
   Responsible men — are response-able. This is your job. A woman has
   her’s. Focus on yours. Real Men don’t focus responsibility on women
   staying “pure” but on men not pressuring. (Truth is, none of us are
   pure, and the onus is on you, to pursue holiness.)
   Real Men never pressure but treasure. No one tries to crush a diamond.
   Because pressuring a girl? Is blackmail, coercion and repeated robbery
   attempts. You’re meant to be a man, not the mafia. When you’re
   pressuring a girl for what you want — is your flag to lean into Jesus
   who will give you what you need.
   The thing is: Real Manhood means you hallow womanhood. A woman isn’t a
   toy to amuse your lusts, a thing to aggrandize your ego, a trophy to
   adorn your manhood. A woman is of your rib, who birthed your rib, who
   cupped your rib, who is meant to be gently cherished at your rib, at
   your side.
   The culture of boys will be boys — means girls will be garbage and you
   were made for more than this. I believe boys will be godly and boys
   will be honoring and boys will be humble.
   Real men like their Father — who laid down His life for His daughters.
