Spacecraft at Io Sees and Sniffs Tallest Volcanic Plume

   Illustration of Galileo at Jupiter

   Jupiter's moon Io has pulled a surprise on NASA's Galileo spacecraft,
   hurling up the tallest volcanic plume ever seen, which arose from a
   previously unknown volcano.

   A different volcano had been lofting a plume seven months earlier, but
   Galileo saw no sign of that plume during its latest Io flyby in early
   August.

   Adding to the surprise, for the first time a Galileo instrument has
   caught particles freshly released from an eruption, giving scientists a
   direct sample of Io material to analyze. "This was totally unexpected,"
   said the leader of that experiment, Dr. Louis Frank of the University
   of Iowa, Iowa City. "We've had wonderful images and other remote
   sensing of the volcanoes on Io before, but we've never caught the hot
   breath from one of them until now. Galileo smelled the volcano's strong
   breath and survived."

   The Jupiter-orbiting spacecraft has been gradually transmitting to
   Earth the new pictures and data from its flight over Io's north pole in
   early August, said Dr. Eilene Theilig, Galileo project manager at
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. "Io just keeps
   amazing everyone," she said. "Now we're eager to see what will be
   happening there when Galileo flies near Io's south pole in two weeks."

   Galileo engineers and scientists had anticipated that the Aug. 6 flyby
   (Aug. 5, Pacific time) might take the spacecraft right through gases
   rising from a volcano named Tvashtar near Io's north pole. Tvashtar had
   been lofting a high plume when last seen seven months earlier by both
   Galileo and the passing Cassini spacecraft. However, the Tvashtar plume
   has not been found in images from the August flyby. Researchers were
   startled to find, instead, that a previously unknown volcano just 600
   kilometers (370 miles) from Tvashtar was spewing a grand plume as
   Galileo passed.

   "After not seeing any active plumes at all in Io's high-latitude
   regions during the first five years of Galileo's tour, we've now seen
   two this year," said Galileo imaging team member Dr. Alfred McEwen of
   the University of Arizona, Tucson. The latest appears as a back-lit
   bulge above Io's surface in two newly released images. A third new
   image shows a white ring of material from the plume that has fallen
   back to the moon's surface, painting a circle around the source of the
   eruption. A fourth shows another new large plume deposit near Io's
   north pole.

   The images are available at the University of Arizona at
   http://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/Galileo/Releases .

   The new plume rises at least 500 kilometers (more than 300 miles) above
   ground, McEwen estimated, nearly 10 percent higher than the tallest
   ever seen before on Io.

   Scientists using Galileo's infrared mapping instrument have pinpointed
   the site of the eruption as a new hot spot at a location that was not
   known to be an active volcano, said JPL volcanologist Dr. Rosaly Lopes.
   It was surprising that the site leapt to such intense activity so
   abruptly with so little evidence of former volcanism, she said.

   "Galileo flew between two great volcanoes," Lopes said. "The plume we
   knew about might have settled down before we got there, but this new
   one sprang up suddenly."

   The particles detected in Galileo's plasma science instrument as the
   aging spacecraft sped within 194 kilometers (120 miles) of Io's surface
   likely came from the new hot spot rather than Tvashtar, Frank said. The
   volcanic material reached the spacecraft no more than a few minutes
   after rushing out of the source vent on the ground. The particles are
   apparently snowflakes made of sulfur-dioxide molecules with as many as
   15 to 20 molecules clumped together in each flake.

   Frank and co-workers will try to wring information from the particle
   impacts about the temperature and speed of the gas in the plume. "That
   will get us a step closer to knowing about the newly released material
   from a volcanic vent," he said.

   Galileo is on course to fly about as close to Io again at 0123
   Universal Time on Oct. 16 (6:30 p.m. Oct. 15, Pacific time). Its
   trajectory will take it close to Io's south pole, which may provide a
   look at details of another new hot spot near there identified from
   infrared mapping data this year. The polar passes in August and this
   month were also designed to provide data indicating whether Io
   generates its own magnetic field, as its sibling moon Ganymede does and
   Earth does.

   Io is the innermost of Jupiter's four largest moons and the most
   volcanically active world in the solar system. Galileo will get its
   sixth and final encounter with Io in January 2002. It has also flown 27
   close approaches to Jupiter's other three large moons: Europa, Ganymede
   and Callisto. Since it began orbiting Jupiter in 1995, Galileo has
   survived more than three times the radiation exposure it was designed
   to withstand. It is still is good overall health, but performance of
   some instruments has been degraded.

   manages Galileo for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.

Earth-like Planets

What's an Exoplanet?

   A trillion planets in our galaxy alone and many of them in Earth’s size
   range.
   What is an Exoplanet?
   All of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun. Planets
   that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets. Click here to see

Deep Space Network

What is the DSN?

   The largest international array of giant radio antennas supporting
   interplanetary spacecraft missions.
   What is the Deep Space Network?
   The DSN consists of three facilities spaced equidistant from each other
   – approximately 120 degrees apart in longitude – around the world.
   These sites are at Goldstone, near Barstow, California; near Madrid,
   Spain; and near Canberra, Australia. Click to learn more.
