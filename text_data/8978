VILLA LC by DFG Architetti

   Leave a reply

   VILLA LC is a project designed by DFG Architetti in 2019 and is located
   in Ragusa. An architecture that arises from the archetype of the house,
   the pitched roof, as we would have drawn from small, that goes down to
   the ground and generates a scenographic entrance, which embraces the
   guests, to culminate in a body of water in which one reflects a reverse
   world. Photography by Marcello Bocchieri.

   winter garden and a wood burning fireplace in a prestigious new house
   in the Khamovniki district. The apartment is located on the top floor

A Brockley Side by CAN

   Leave a reply

   A Brockley Side is a project designed by CAN. A rear side extension
   opens the back of this Victorian terrace house to it’s garden. A new
   glazed roof brings light deep into the plan. The floor throughout the
   rear of the house was lowered to provide additional head height and a
   consistent level with the new patio. The large pivot door allows
   unobstructed views of the garden, visually extending the space.
