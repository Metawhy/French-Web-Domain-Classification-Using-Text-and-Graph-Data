Our End User Privacy Policy

Who are we?

   Smart (“Smart”, “our”, “us”, “we”) is a fully transparent ad
   monetization platform, Supply Side Platform (“Platform”) providing
   programmatic buyers with exclusive access to high quality premium
   publisher (“Clients”) inventory. As an independent, publisher-focused
   platform, we help our Clients monetize their websites (“Services”)so
   that they can continue offering users (“Users”, “you”, “your”) content.

   Our technology gathers User information to optimize the delivery of
   digital advertising to you. We use this information to effectively
   tailor advertising to you and for statistical reporting and analytics
   purposes, as explained below.

   Smart AdServer is located at 66 rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, 75009
   Paris, France. If you have any questions regarding privacy, you can
   contact us at privacy@smartadserver.com.

   The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain what information we
   gather, for which purposes, how we use that information and what we do
   to protect it. This policy provides details about choices you can make
   with regards to  how we gather and use information about you (“Personal
   Data”).

How do we collect data ?

   Smart uses technologies like cookies, tags, and mobile SDKs to collect
   the data and store it on a user’s device.

   Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters,
   stored in the user’s device. They allow us to recognize and remember
   the user’s browser, preferences and other information.

   The Smart tag is a small piece of code that is inserted into a Client’s
   website source code, which allows them to have access and manage our
   services.

   An SDK, or Software Development Kit, is the software used by our
   Clients to integrate Smart to their mobile application (iOS and
   Android).

   Web beacons are used to help our Clients understand how visitors
   interact with their websites. Pixel tags are transparent images,
   iFrames, or JavaScript that are placed on a site. The use of a pixel
   tag allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the
   page that contains the tag.

What data do we process?

   -IP address;

   -cookie information, for example your unique browser ID;

   –technical information about the device: browser, operating system,
   screen size;

   –information about the geographic location of the device when it
   accesses a website;

   -pseudonymous ID of audience segmentation (if the website uses this
   type of system);

   -information about other identifiers assigned to the device (IDFA,
   AAID);

   -information about the user’s activity on the device, including web
   pages and mobile apps visited or used.

   Please note that as part of our Services we do not collect any
   information that could directly identify you. This means we do not know
   who you are. We do not know your address, your place of work, your date
   of birth, your email address, or your phone number. We do not collect
   sensitive information (such as your religious affiliation, political
   opinions or health details). We do not create segments to specifically
   target children under 16 years old.

For which purposes and on which grounds will Personal Data be processed?

   1. Purposes

   Smart does not receive, collect or process information unless it is
   used for the following purposes:

   –to perform our Services to our Clients, including providing,
   operating, managing, maintaining and enhancing our Platform;

   -to improve our performance;

   -to perform interest-based advertising and increase the relevancy of
   the ads being displayed to you;

   -to perform optimization in respect to a campaign, including to limit
   the number of times you see a particular ad;

   -to customize ads to a particular location;

   -to show ads related to the content of the concerned web page;

   –to report aggregated statistics (for example, to understand the
   effectiveness of an online advertising campaign);

   -to secure, amend and improve our Services;

   In some cases, if our Client requests it, and if you gave your clear
   and informed consent during the course of our Services, we will analyze
   your information to build individual profiles. These profiles will be
   used to predict future interests and display targeted advertisements,
   with the aim of providing you with relevant and interesting offers. The
   profiling is based on your behavior on our Client’s website. As we do
   not collect information to directly identify you (your name, for
   example), we expect that our Services will have no further impact,
   other than providing you with a good user experience when visiting our
   Clients’ websites.

   2. Legal Grounds

   When we are operating as a data controller, meaning that we determine
   the purposes and the means of the processing, we rely on:

   i) user consent, if required; or

   ii) our legitimate interests to

   -decide which buyer and creative wins an auction to purchase
   advertising inventory;

   -optimize the real-time purchase and sale of advertising inventory.

   When we are operating as a data processor, we are processing the data
   on behalf of our Clients based on their instructions. Therefore, they
   are accountable for the establishment of an appropriate legal basis for
   the processing of the data.  You can find this information in their own
   Privacy Policy available on their website.

To whom do we provide your Personal Data? Who can have access to your
Personal Data?

   We may share information, including Personal Data, with trusted third
   parties that provide services for Smart, such as hosting and internet
   connectivity. We may also share data with trusted business partners in
   order to perform or enhance our products and services.

   We may also disclose information if:

   -we are required by national or international law or legislation to do
   so;

   -we must comply with an authorized request or demand;

   -it is necessary in order to defend our own rights or interests.

   Finally, we may transfer your data to a successor entity in connection
   with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or
   other corporate change.

How long do we store the data?

   The data we use to provide our Services is being kept between two days
   and thirteen months, depending on the cookie or tag storing it. For
   more details about the storage duration, please see the table below.

   Once the duration period has been reached, the data is then no longer
   active. For security and regulatory purposes it is stored in our
   archive databases in  compressed form for a maximum of 36 months.

Your privacy rights

   When we are operating as a data controller, you can exercise your
   rights directly to us.. Please note that we do process Personal Data on
   behalf of Publishers. In some cases, it may be appropriate for you to
   exercise your rights directly on the website of the Publisher of your
   choice.

   -to confirm your Personal Data is being processed and/or to provide you
   a copy of your Personal Data;

   -to rectify your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or incomplete;

   -to withdraw your consent;

   -to erase your Personal Data, for instance if it is unlawfully
   processed or if you withdraw your consent;

   -to opt out the process of any data;

   –to restrict the processing of your Personal Data, (i) if the
   information is inaccurate, (ii) the processing is unlawful, (iii) you
   need us to retain the information after the retention for a legal
   claim, or (iv) you have objected to the processing and a verification
   of our legitimate interests is pending;

   –to provide you with an electronic file of your Personal Data, or to
   transfer your Personal Data to a third party, if technically feasible
   (portability).

   Before sending any requests, please note and consider that it is not
   feasible for us to provide Personal Data that is tied to your identity.
   Instead, you can provide us with your Smart AdServer ID and we will be
   able connect this information with the Personal Data tied to this ID
   (see section: How to find your Smart AdServer ID below).

   Your request should be addressed to privacy@smartadserver.com. We will
   respond within one month. If permitted under applicable legislation, we
   may extend the response period to two months if such is necessary due
   to the complexity and number of requests. We will notify and explain
   the reasons of any extension to you. If we deny your request, we will
   inform you of the reasons of such denial.

   If you consider your rights have been infringed upon according to the
   current privacy regulation, or regarding the denial of a request, you
   may lodge a complaint towards your local competent supervisory
   authority.

What makes us Smart

   In today’s ad tech world, reaching a more valuable audience is more
   critical than ever before. Programmatic advances have created
   short-term gains, but for publishers and buyers, sticking with the
   programmatic status quo jeopardizes long-term success. It’s Smart’s
   mission to help tomorrow’s leaders shift to a radically different ad
   tech model and take back control.

   Our fully transparent platform and shared-interest business approach
   enable premium publishers and brands to get their fair share of ad
   value at every opportunity, on their terms. In a shared-interest
   business approach you always act with certainty and have control of all
   the variables for the right blend of transaction models, channels and
   formats, while activating the right audience data for value path
   optimization.
