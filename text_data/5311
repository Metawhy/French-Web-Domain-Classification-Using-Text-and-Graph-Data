   Cookies and Similar Technologies

   What are Cookies?
   When you visit our CASIO-Website, open our e-mails, or view our
   services online, we or an authorized third party may send you a cookie.
   Cookies are small text files located in your browser directory that may
   be placed on your device. When a website is accessed, a cookie that is
   placed on a device will send information to the party that has placed
   the cookie. Cookies are extremely common and used on a number of
   websites. Each cookie will typically contain the name of the domain
   from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a
   value (usually a unique number). For a more thorough explanation of
   what cookies are and how they operate, please visit
   https://www.aboutcookies.org/ or http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.

   First Party and Third Party Cookies
   Our CASIO-Website may place first party cookies and allow third parties
   to place cookies on your device. The difference between a first party
   cookie and a third party cookie relates to the control of the party who
   serves the cookie. First party cookies are cookies that are specific to
   the website that created them. Their use enables us to operate an
   efficient service and to track the patterns of behavior of website
   users. Third party cookies, on the other hand, are placed on your
   device by a third party (i.e., not by CASIO). While we may allow third
   parties access to the CASIO-Website to place these cookies on users’
   devices, we do not retain control over the information supplied by the
   cookies, nor do we retain access to that data. This information is
   controlled wholly by that third party in accordance with their
   respective privacy policy.

   Session and Persistent Cookies
   Our CASIO-Website may place session and persistent cookies on your
   device. Whereas the difference between a first party and third party
   cookie relates to the party controlling the initial placement of the
   cookie on your device, the difference between a session and a
   persistent cookie relates to the length of time the cookie lasts.
   Session cookies are cookies that typically last for as long as you are
   using your browser, or browser session. When you end your browser
   session, the cookie expires. Persistent cookies, as the name implies,
   are persistent and will last after you close your browser. This allows
   for quicker and often more convenient access to our website.

   Clear GIFs/Web Beacons
   Clear GIFs (also known as Web Beacons) are typically transparent very
   small graphic images (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that are placed on a
   website, which may be included on our services provided via our
   CASIO-Website and typically work in conjunction with cookies to
   identify our users and user behavior.

Privacy policy of CASIO Europe GmbH

    1. General information about the collection of personal data
       CASIO Europe GmbH (hereinafter "CASIO") takes the protection of
       your personal data extremely seriously. This Data Privacy Policy
       describes how CASIO (hereinafter also "we", "us" and "our") uses
       and protects the data collected via the casio-europe.com ("CASIO

            e-mail: dataprotection@casio.de
    3. Notes on lawfulness and period of storage
          + Lawfulness of the processing of personal data
            If we obtain your consent for the processing operations of
            personal data, Article 6 (1) a) GDPR is the legal basis for
            the processing of personal data.
            With regard to the processing of personal data which are
            required to perform a contract with you, Article 6 (1) b) GDPR
            is the relevant legal basis. This also applies to processing
            operations which already become relevant precontractually.
            If processing of your personal data is required to fulfil one
            of our legal obligations, Article 6 (1) c) GDPR serves as the
            legal basis.
            In the event that vital interests on your part or in the case
            of another natural person are interfered with which make a
            processing of personal data necessary, Article 6 (1) d) GDPR
            serves as the legal basis for this processing.
            If processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of
            our company or of a third party and your interests,
            fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not override
            our legitimate interest, Article 6 (1) f) GDPR serves as the
            legal basis for processing.
            We do not exercise any automated decision-taking in relation
            with the processing of personal data through the CASIO
            website.
          + Storage period and erasure of data
            The personal data collected, processed and stored by us will
            essentially only be stored for such time as demanded by the
            concrete purpose of storage. If the purpose of
            storage/processing ceases to apply, i.e., when we no longer
            need to use your personal data to comply with contractual or
            statutory obligations, your data will be erased or anonymized.
            However, the situation may furthermore arise where European
            regulations, applicable national laws or other regulations
            (e.g. regulatory obligations) require that the data processed
            by us be retained for a longer period of time, e.g. statutory
            retention periods which can result from, e.g. Commercial Code,
            Tax Code and usually contain retention periods from 6 to 10
            years, or if we need it to preserve evidence within the
            statutes of limitation, which is usually three years but can
            be up to thirty years. When these retention periods expire, we
            delete or anonymize your data.
    4. Your rights
       Insofar as we process your personal data, you are a "data subject"
       as contemplated by the GDPR. As a data subject, you may have the
       following rights in respect of CASIO. To exercise your rights
       please contact us as stated in Section 2.
          + Right of access regarding processing
            You can within the framework of the statutory provision
            request from us information as to whether personal data are
            processed by us. If this is the case, you have the right to
            request information about the extent of the data processing.
            The access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of
            the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and
            the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the
            personal data have been or will be disclosed. You may have the
            right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing
            processing. However, this is not an absolute right and the
            interests of other individuals may restrict your right to
            obtain such copy.
            The right of access is limited pursuant to Section 34 FDPA.
            The right of access does e.g. not apply if the data (a) were
            recorded only because they may not be erased due to legal or
            statutory provisions on retention, or (b) only serve the
            purposes of monitoring data protection or safeguarding data,
            and providing information would require a disproportionate
            effort, and appropriate technical and organizational measures
            make processing for other purposes impossible.
          + Right to rectification ("Right to be forgotten")
            You may have a right to have your data corrected by CASIO if
            the processed personal data concerning you are incorrect.
            Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the
            right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by
            means of providing a supplementary statement.
          + Right to restriction of processing
            If the preconditions exist for this, you can request the
            restriction of the processing of your personal data. In this
            case, the respective data will be marked and may only be
            processed by us for certain purposes.
          + Right to erasure
            Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to obtain
            from us to erase of personal data concerning you and we may be
            obliged to erase such personal data. Such right to erasure
            does pursuant to Section 35 FDPA, for instance, not apply if
            in the case of a non-automated processing erasure would be
            impossible or would involve disproportionate effort due to the
            specific mode of storage and if your interest in erasure can
            be regarded as minimal. In such case, you may have the right
            to restriction of processing.
          + Right to data portability
            Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to receive
            the personal data concerning you which you have provided to
            CASIO in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
            format. Furthermore, you have the right to communicate these
            data to another controller without hindrance from CASIO
            provided the preconditions exist for this.
            Right of objection
            You have the right for reasons arising from your particular
            situation at any time to lodge an objection against the
            processing of the personal data concerning you that occurs on
            the basis of Article 6 (1) e) or f) GDPR.
            The consequence of your an objection is that CASIO will no
            longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can
            demonstrate compelling reasons worthy of protection for the
            processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms
            or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend
            legal claims.
            In the event that we undertake marketing in respect of
            yourself, you have the right at any time to lodge an objection
            against the processing of the personal data concerning you for
            such promotional purposes. You can notify us of your objection
            using the following contact details:

            e-mail: info@casio.de
          + Right to withdraw your consent under data protection law
            If you have consented under data protection law, you can
            withdraw this at any time for the future. Withdrawal of
            consent shall not affect the lawfulness of the processing
            conducted on the basis of the consent up to the point of
            withdrawal.
          + Right to appeal to a supervisory authority
            You may appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in
            the Member State of your place of residence, your workplace or
            the place of the suspected infringement if you are of the
            opinion that the processing of the personal data concerning
            you infringes the GDPR.

    7. Dealer search
       On our CASIO website we offer you as a user the opportunity to
       search for the specialist dealer of our products who is nearest to
       your immediate location. For this purpose we collect from you your
       geo data; this involves you entering these data in a designated
       form (a) or clicking to allow your web browser to identify your
       location by means of IP address (b). To be able to display the
       right specialist dealer, CASIO uses the service Google Maps API, a
       map service operated by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google can be
       contacted at Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House,
       Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. In this way, we can display
       interactive maps directly in your web browser and enable you to use
       the map function conveniently.
          + Collecting the data by form
            You have the opportunity on our CASIO website for the
            specialist-dealer search to complete a form in which you enter
            (optionally) the following details:
               o Your country
               o Your postcode or your town/city
               o If necessary, street/road name
            Then click on “Find dealer” and the specialist-dealer search
            is activated. In this way, Google receives the information
            that you have called up the corresponding subpage of our
            website. In addition, the following data are communicated to
            Google:
               o Your IP address
               o Date and time of the request
               o The time-zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
               o Contents of the request (concrete page)
               o Access status/HTTP status code
               o Data volume transmitted in each case
               o Website from which the request comes
               o Your browser type
               o Your operating system and its interface
               o Your language and version of the browser software
            This takes place irrespective of whether Google provides a
            user account via which you are logged in or whether no user
            account exists at Google. When you are logged in to Google,
            your data are assigned directly to your account. If you do not
            want your data to be assigned with your profile at Google, you
            must log out from Google before visiting the CASIO website.
            You have the opportunity to disable the Google Maps service in
            an easy way and thereby prevent data transfer to Google: To do
            so, disable JavaScript in your browser. However, we remind you
            that in this case you will not be able to use the map display.
            Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has
            submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield for this purpose:
            https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.
            The use of Google Maps API is justified in accordance with
            Article 6 (1) Sentence 1 b) GDPR since the data in the present
            case are required to perform the contract. We use Google Maps
            API to be able to offer you a map function so that you find
            the right specialist dealer as quickly as possible. If you
            consented to such processing, we use your browser data for the
            purpose of market and opinion research and optimization of our
            CASIO website as well as for personalizing your user
            experience with Google Analytics. The legal basis for the
            processing of your browser data is Article 6 (1) ( f) GDPR for
            the optimization of our CASIO website. We provide you with
            further information on the balancing test upon request.
            For further information on the purpose and extent of data
            collection and processing by Google, please refer to Google’s
            Data Privacy Policy. This also provides further information

            protect your privacy:
            http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.
          + Collecting the data via your web browser’s geo query
            CASIO sometimes uses websites which facilitate
            location-dependent browsing. It is therefore possible for your
            web browser, before you enter the data independently, already
            to ask whether our CASIO website is permitted to access your
            location. As soon as you permit your web browser to approve
            the website with an active click, the browser transmits data
            (degrees of longitude and latitude) to the Google location
            service to determine your approximate location. The browser
            then releases this information for the querying CASIO website
            so that CASIO can display the right specialist dealer for you.
            In view of data processing by Google, reference is made to
            Dealer search - Collecting the data by form above of this Data
            Privacy Policy.
            The legal basis for processing is in this case Article 6 (1)
            Sentence 1 b) GDPR.

   Cookies and Similar Technologies

   What are Cookies?
   When you visit our CASIO-Website, open our e-mails, or view our
   services online, we or an authorized third party may send you a cookie.
   Cookies are small text files located in your browser directory that may
   be placed on your device. When a website is accessed, a cookie that is
   placed on a device will send information to the party that has placed
   the cookie. Cookies are extremely common and used on a number of
   websites. Each cookie will typically contain the name of the domain
   from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a
   value (usually a unique number). For a more thorough explanation of
   what cookies are and how they operate, please visit
   https://www.aboutcookies.org/ or http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.

   First Party and Third Party Cookies
   Our CASIO-Website may place first party cookies and allow third parties
   to place cookies on your device. The difference between a first party
   cookie and a third party cookie relates to the control of the party who
   serves the cookie. First party cookies are cookies that are specific to
   the website that created them. Their use enables us to operate an
   efficient service and to track the patterns of behavior of website
   users. Third party cookies, on the other hand, are placed on your
   device by a third party (i.e., not by CASIO). While we may allow third
   parties access to the CASIO-Website to place these cookies on users’
   devices, we do not retain control over the information supplied by the
   cookies, nor do we retain access to that data. This information is
   controlled wholly by that third party in accordance with their
   respective privacy policy.

   Session and Persistent Cookies
   Our CASIO-Website may place session and persistent cookies on your
   device. Whereas the difference between a first party and third party
   cookie relates to the party controlling the initial placement of the
   cookie on your device, the difference between a session and a
   persistent cookie relates to the length of time the cookie lasts.
   Session cookies are cookies that typically last for as long as you are
   using your browser, or browser session. When you end your browser
   session, the cookie expires. Persistent cookies, as the name implies,
   are persistent and will last after you close your browser. This allows
   for quicker and often more convenient access to our website.

   Clear GIFs/Web Beacons
   Clear GIFs (also known as Web Beacons) are typically transparent very
   small graphic images (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that are placed on a
   website, which may be included on our services provided via our
   CASIO-Website and typically work in conjunction with cookies to
   identify our users and user behavior.

Privacy policy of CASIO Europe GmbH

    1. General information about the collection of personal data
       CASIO Europe GmbH (hereinafter "CASIO") takes the protection of
       your personal data extremely seriously. This Data Privacy Policy
       describes how CASIO (hereinafter also "we", "us" and "our") uses
       and protects the data collected via the casio-europe.com ("CASIO

       Personal data are all data which can be related to you personally,

       address, your e-mail address, your telephone number, your bank

       with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
       ("GDPR") and other provisions of applicable national data

            e-mail: dataprotection@casio.de
    3. Notes on lawfulness and period of storage
          + Lawfulness of the processing of personal data
            If we obtain your consent for the processing operations of
            personal data, Article 6 (1) a) GDPR is the legal basis for
            the processing of personal data.
            With regard to the processing of personal data which are
            required to perform a contract with you, Article 6 (1) b) GDPR
            is the relevant legal basis. This also applies to processing
            operations which already become relevant precontractually.
            If processing of your personal data is required to fulfil one
            of our legal obligations, Article 6 (1) c) GDPR serves as the
            legal basis.
            In the event that vital interests on your part or in the case
            of another natural person are interfered with which make a
            processing of personal data necessary, Article 6 (1) d) GDPR
            serves as the legal basis for this processing.
            If processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of
            our company or of a third party and your interests,
            fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not override
            our legitimate interest, Article 6 (1) f) GDPR serves as the
            legal basis for processing.
            We do not exercise any automated decision-taking in relation
            with the processing of personal data through the CASIO
            website.
          + Storage period and erasure of data
            The personal data collected, processed and stored by us will
            essentially only be stored for such time as demanded by the
            concrete purpose of storage. If the purpose of
            storage/processing ceases to apply, i.e., when we no longer
            need to use your personal data to comply with contractual or
            statutory obligations, your data will be erased or anonymized.
            However, the situation may furthermore arise where European
            regulations, applicable national laws or other regulations
            (e.g. regulatory obligations) require that the data processed
            by us be retained for a longer period of time, e.g. statutory
            retention periods which can result from, e.g. Commercial Code,
            Tax Code and usually contain retention periods from 6 to 10
            years, or if we need it to preserve evidence within the
            statutes of limitation, which is usually three years but can
            be up to thirty years. When these retention periods expire, we
            delete or anonymize your data.
    4. Your rights
       Insofar as we process your personal data, you are a "data subject"
       as contemplated by the GDPR. As a data subject, you may have the
       following rights in respect of CASIO. To exercise your rights
       please contact us as stated in Section 2.
          + Right of access regarding processing
            You can within the framework of the statutory provision
            request from us information as to whether personal data are
            processed by us. If this is the case, you have the right to
            request information about the extent of the data processing.
            The access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of
            the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and
            the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the
            personal data have been or will be disclosed. You may have the
            right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing
            processing. However, this is not an absolute right and the
            interests of other individuals may restrict your right to
            obtain such copy.
            The right of access is limited pursuant to Section 34 FDPA.
            The right of access does e.g. not apply if the data (a) were
            recorded only because they may not be erased due to legal or
            statutory provisions on retention, or (b) only serve the
            purposes of monitoring data protection or safeguarding data,
            and providing information would require a disproportionate
            effort, and appropriate technical and organizational measures
            make processing for other purposes impossible.
          + Right to rectification ("Right to be forgotten")
            You may have a right to have your data corrected by CASIO if
            the processed personal data concerning you are incorrect.
            Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the
            right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by
            means of providing a supplementary statement.
          + Right to restriction of processing
            If the preconditions exist for this, you can request the
            restriction of the processing of your personal data. In this
            case, the respective data will be marked and may only be
            processed by us for certain purposes.
          + Right to erasure
            Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to obtain
            from us to erase of personal data concerning you and we may be
            obliged to erase such personal data. Such right to erasure
            does pursuant to Section 35 FDPA, for instance, not apply if
            in the case of a non-automated processing erasure would be
            impossible or would involve disproportionate effort due to the
            specific mode of storage and if your interest in erasure can
            be regarded as minimal. In such case, you may have the right
            to restriction of processing.
          + Right to data portability
            Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to receive
            the personal data concerning you which you have provided to
            CASIO in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
            format. Furthermore, you have the right to communicate these
            data to another controller without hindrance from CASIO
            provided the preconditions exist for this.
            Right of objection
            You have the right for reasons arising from your particular
            situation at any time to lodge an objection against the
            processing of the personal data concerning you that occurs on
            the basis of Article 6 (1) e) or f) GDPR.
            The consequence of your an objection is that CASIO will no
            longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can
            demonstrate compelling reasons worthy of protection for the
            processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms
            or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend
            legal claims.
            In the event that we undertake marketing in respect of
            yourself, you have the right at any time to lodge an objection
            against the processing of the personal data concerning you for
            such promotional purposes. You can notify us of your objection
            using the following contact details:

            e-mail: info@casio.de
          + Right to withdraw your consent under data protection law
            If you have consented under data protection law, you can
            withdraw this at any time for the future. Withdrawal of
            consent shall not affect the lawfulness of the processing
            conducted on the basis of the consent up to the point of
            withdrawal.
          + Right to appeal to a supervisory authority
            You may appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in
            the Member State of your place of residence, your workplace or
            the place of the suspected infringement if you are of the
            opinion that the processing of the personal data concerning
            you infringes the GDPR.

    7. Dealer search
       On our CASIO website we offer you as a user the opportunity to
       search for the specialist dealer of our products who is nearest to
       your immediate location. For this purpose we collect from you your
       geo data; this involves you entering these data in a designated
       form (a) or clicking to allow your web browser to identify your
       location by means of IP address (b). To be able to display the
       right specialist dealer, CASIO uses the service Google Maps API, a
       map service operated by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google can be
       contacted at Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House,
       Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. In this way, we can display
       interactive maps directly in your web browser and enable you to use
       the map function conveniently.
          + Collecting the data by form
            You have the opportunity on our CASIO website for the
            specialist-dealer search to complete a form in which you enter
            (optionally) the following details:
               o Your country
               o Your postcode or your town/city
               o If necessary, street/road name
            Then click on “Find dealer” and the specialist-dealer search
            is activated. In this way, Google receives the information
            that you have called up the corresponding subpage of our
            website. In addition, the following data are communicated to
            Google:
               o Your IP address
               o Date and time of the request
               o The time-zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
               o Contents of the request (concrete page)
               o Access status/HTTP status code
               o Data volume transmitted in each case
               o Website from which the request comes
               o Your browser type
               o Your operating system and its interface
               o Your language and version of the browser software
            This takes place irrespective of whether Google provides a
            user account via which you are logged in or whether no user
            account exists at Google. When you are logged in to Google,
            your data are assigned directly to your account. If you do not
            want your data to be assigned with your profile at Google, you
            must log out from Google before visiting the CASIO website.
            You have the opportunity to disable the Google Maps service in
            an easy way and thereby prevent data transfer to Google: To do
            so, disable JavaScript in your browser. However, we remind you
            that in this case you will not be able to use the map display.
            Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has
            submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield for this purpose:
            https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.
            The use of Google Maps API is justified in accordance with
            Article 6 (1) Sentence 1 b) GDPR since the data in the present
            case are required to perform the contract. We use Google Maps
            API to be able to offer you a map function so that you find
            the right specialist dealer as quickly as possible. If you
            consented to such processing, we use your browser data for the
            purpose of market and opinion research and optimization of our
            CASIO website as well as for personalizing your user
            experience with Google Analytics. The legal basis for the
            processing of your browser data is Article 6 (1) ( f) GDPR for
            the optimization of our CASIO website. We provide you with
            further information on the balancing test upon request.
            For further information on the purpose and extent of data
            collection and processing by Google, please refer to Google’s
            Data Privacy Policy. This also provides further information

            protect your privacy:
            http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.
          + Collecting the data via your web browser’s geo query
            CASIO sometimes uses websites which facilitate
            location-dependent browsing. It is therefore possible for your
            web browser, before you enter the data independently, already
            to ask whether our CASIO website is permitted to access your
            location. As soon as you permit your web browser to approve
            the website with an active click, the browser transmits data
            (degrees of longitude and latitude) to the Google location
            service to determine your approximate location. The browser
            then releases this information for the querying CASIO website
            so that CASIO can display the right specialist dealer for you.
            In view of data processing by Google, reference is made to
            Dealer search - Collecting the data by form above of this Data
            Privacy Policy.
            The legal basis for processing is in this case Article 6 (1)
