   Targeting cookies

   These cookies are set through our site by advertising parties. They may
   be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and
   show you relevant ads on other sites. They work by uniquely identifying
   your browser and device.

   Advertising Cookies

   Third-party cookies are used for all ad retargeting and behavioral
   advertising. By adding tags to a page, advertisers can track a user or
   their device across different websites. That helps build a profile of
   the user based on their habits, so messages can be better targeted to
   their interests. Cookies from social networks allow you to share our
   site's content and your opinion on it with others, e.g. "Share" and
   "Like" application buttons, from social networks such as Facebook,
   Twitter, LinkedIn, Viadeo, etc. The social network which supplies these
   application buttons can identify you using this button, even if you
   have not clicked on it while browsing our site. This is because some
   cookies allow the social network concerned to track your browsing of
   our site if the social network is activated on your device while
   browsing our site. We have no control over the processes used by social
   networks to collect information about your browsing of our website.
   Please check the relevant social networks' personal data protection
   policies. These give you certain confidentiality options in relation to
   social networks, particularly by configuring your account settings with
   each network. The length of time third-party cookies, such as cookies
   from social networks, are retained can be amended at any time before
   LafargeHolcim receives the information. Once LafargeHolcim has been
   informed, changes to duration will be indicated within this policy.
