Global WordNet Grid

   The building of a completely free worldwide Global WordNet Grid, which
   will be build around a shared set of concepts used in many wordnet
   projects.

   We invite people from all language communities to upload synsets from
   their language to the Grid. Gradually, the Grid will then be
   represented by all languages.
