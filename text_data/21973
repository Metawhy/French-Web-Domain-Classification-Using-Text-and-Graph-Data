BIG Freebie...Just Around the Corner

   [500FollowersButton.jpg]
   Wow! You all are amazing. I am only 14 TpT followers away from reaching
   my 500 follower goal.
   [TpT+Stat.png]
   Keep up the awesome work! I said I would give you all until August
   15th, but I have a feeling together we are going to reach my goal
   before then. YAY!!!
   I want to give you a sneak peak at the freebie. Here you go...
   First of all, I ordered these super cute library pockets to go with the
   job cards. Remember, I will also provide a template to create your own
   library pockets from colored card stock or scrapbooking paper.  (Click
   on picture to purchase from Amazon)
   [photo+1.JPG]
   **If sold out, search "Polka Dot Black Terrific Pockets." Trend
   Enterprises also sells super cute pockets. Click here
   [photo-4.JPG]
   I folded the top tab over and tucked it in to give it a cleaner look.
   [photo+2.JPG]
   (Paper Passer and Food Patrol are not in this picture).
   I printed the cards on card stock and laminated them. I used double
   sided tape to stick the picture cards to the library pockets.
   [photo+3.JPG]
   Once I get all the pockets hung on the wall, I will use popsicle sticks
   with the students' names on them to designate a job to each student.
   In the freebie I will include 6 different colored title cards. See
   below...
   [Title+Cards.jpg]
   I can't wait to give this away! Thank you all once again for helping me
   promote my TpT store and reach 500 FOLLOWERS! YAY!

Calling all Followers....

   I am looking to reach a personal goal and I could really use your help.
   My goal is to reach 500 followers in my TpT store. I currently have 473
   followers, so I am almost there.
   Now... what is in this for you? Well, I have been working on a very
   special Job Chart. If I can reach 500 followers by August 15th, I will
   share this file exclusively with my blog followers for FREE. (It will
   not be offered in my TpT store.)
   Check out what I have been working on...
   [Screen+Shot+2014-07-18+at+1.03.19+PM.png]
   The job cards I currently have are as follows:
     * Line Leader
     * Caboose
     * Door Holder
     * Floor Crew
     * Librarian
     * Calendar
     * Messenger
     * Deck Checker
     * Whiteboard Duty
     * Teacher Helper
     * Pencil Patrol
     * Supplies
     * Substitute
     * Carpet Clean-Up
     * Punch Cards
     * Computer Helper
     * Lighting Crew
     * Recess Supplies

   There will also be a title card that says "Our Jobs."
   I would really appreciate your feedback on these. If you have a job
   card that you would like in this FREEBIE please comment below and I
   will try to add it to this pack.
   These job cards will fit on the front of library card pockets. I will
   include a template so that you can create your own library pockets
   using whatever card stock or scrapbooking papers you would like. (See
   template below).
   [Screen+Shot+2014-07-18+at+12.49.50+PM.png]
   Here is a picture of my OLD class jobs set up. I have ordered new
   library pockets. Black with white polka dot. I can't wait to get them
   so I can start assembling.

   before school starts.

Countdown to NWEA

   Wow! I just realized I have not posted in a looooong time. Sorry! I am
   going to try to do better on posting more frequently. Anyhow, I am
   currently on spring break and enjoy the nice weather Michigan is
   FINALLY having. It is funny how I know I am suppose to be taking a
   break from school, but all I can think about is the looming NWEA MAP
   test we have at the end of the month. I decided to take action and
   create a packet in which my students could have mixed practice of most
   of the concepts on the NWEA. After about three full days of work, I
   came up with the packet below. You can find it in my TpT store. (Just
   click on the picture)
   [Slide01.jpg]
   Here are pictures of a Math page and an ELA page…
   [SAMPLE+Pages+-+NWEA.png]
   For my blog followers. . .Here is a FREEBIE of one math and ELA page
   from the packet. I hope you like it! Click here for your FREEBIE! I
   hope you find it useful.

Organizing Student Websites

   I am just so excited for this post….For years I have been wanting to
   find a way to make student websites more accessible and easy for my
   students to open. It is hard trying to teach first graders to type a
   URL into the URL bar. They waste so much time trying to type the link
   in and by the time they actually finish they have wasted five minutes
   of their time. Well, I found an AMAZING and FREE website to help me
   organize all their websites. The website I am speaking of is called
   Symbaloo.com. This website allows teachers to organize all the websites
   into icons (which look like app icons). It also allows you to set
   Symbaloo as your homepage, so that when students open the web browser,
   they are already logged into Symbaloo. They simply have to click on the
   icon of the website they wish to visit and WOOSH… off they go. Below is
   a picture of my Symbaloo.com homepage.
   [Screen+Shot+2013-12-13+at+5.14.44+PM.png]
   I have color coded my icon so the students know which section in which
   they should be working. On my page, blue represents websites that may
   be used during "center time." Yellow are the websites students use for
   homework. Red are websites students can use during math time or math
   center time. Green are websites students can use during indoor recess.
   Also, any websites that need a student login, I print out the login
   information for that site and tape inside their classwork folder so
   they always have their username and password available.
   One other feature that is great about Symbaloo is that they have a
   Google search bar build right into your icon page. The students can
   simply search right from the Symbaloo page.
   Now you are probably wondering… "What websites are you using?" Well
   below is a list of the websites I have linked into my Symbaloo.
   Center Time Websites
     * Scootpad - www.scootpad.com (Great website for Common Core
       practice. Also a great way to practice for the NWEA assessment.
       There is a FREE version, but I recommend the premium package. It
       gives you great reports on your students progress. I use Scootpad
       for my students' homework.) In homework icons too.
     * Teach You Monster to Read - http://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com
       (My students are in love with this website. It is great for young
       readers. Many games focusing on reading foundational skills.
       Students logins required but FREE.) In homework icons too.
     * Sum Dog - http://www.sumdog.com (This website is FREE for the math
       component. You can purchase a membership for the reading portion. I
       only have the math portion and love it! There are so many fun
       games. Great way for students to practice Common Core concepts. In
       settings, you can focus the standards to meet your needs. Student
       logins required for this site as well.) In math icons too. In
       homework icons too.
     * RAZ-kids.com - http://www.raz-kids.com (Membership required. Great
       website for a variety of leveled books which students can read

   for.

   STEP #4 - Paste you link and name it. Choose your tile color. Then
   choose your icon to represent that site. (Sometimes an icon is provided
    OR you can choose an icon from the icon library. Below is what this
   part looks like.)
   [Screen+Shot+2013-12-13+at+6.35.49+PM.png]
   STEP #5 - Click "save"
   There you have it. It is as simple as that. I hope you love Symbaloo as
   much as I do. Just give it a try!
