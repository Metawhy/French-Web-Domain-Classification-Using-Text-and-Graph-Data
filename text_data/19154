ABOUT chef richard sandoval


   Growing up in Mexico City, Richard Sandoval would join his grandmother
   in the kitchen and gather around her large table with family to enjoy
   lively Mexican feasts prepared from scratch.

   From his grandmother, he learned to respect fresh, authentic,
   ingredients and create the vibrant flavors that turned family dinners
   into celebrated events. Meanwhile, his restaurateur father - owner of
   Madeiras in Acapulco and Villa Fiore also in Acapulco - imparted
   lessons in service and restaurant management.

   Sandoval, who was once a professional tennis player and had toured the
   world participating in prestigious matches, had such a passion for food
   that he decided to enroll in the Culinary Institute of America. Upon
   graduation, he gained the attention of New Yorkers with his
   contemporary French restaurants, Savann and Savann Est. Soon, though,
   he returned to his first love - the food of his childhood and in 1997
   opened Maya, his flagship modern Mexican restaurant in New York.

   During the past 18 years, Sandoval's career as a Chef-Restaurateur has
   evolved to include serving as a culinary consultant, television
   personality, cookbook author and brand ambassador. RS Hospitality is
   now a leading international restaurant group with over 45 concepts
   spanning Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Texas, New
   York, Virginia and Washington, D.C., as well as in Dubai, Abu Dhabi,
   Mexico, Costa Rica, Tokyo, Qatar and Serbia. Restaurant Business named
   the company on their POWER 20 LIST in 2017.

   With the broad range of restaurants in his portfolio, Chef Sandoval
   combines authentic Latin ingredients with international flavors and
   inventive techniques to create new and unexpected concepts and cuisines
   such as modern and coastal Mexican, Latin-Asian, Peruvian and
   Pan-Latin.

   Sandoval has developed menus for American Airlines First Class cabin,
   as well as many of the world's leading hotels. He is equally passionate
   about tequila and has curated one of the largest collections in North
   America and the Middle East and aspires to educate diners on their
   quality and diversity.

   When not cooking, Sandoval is passionate about training the chefs of
   the future. He supports their growth on the Board of Trustees at his
   alma mater, the Culinary Institute of America and has recently received
   an honorary doctorate from Johnson and Wales. For his work, he has been
   awarded Mexico's National Toque d'Oro 2003, Bon Appétit Restaurateur of
   the Year 2006 and Cordon d'Or Restaurateur of the Year 2012 and various
   other awards for his restaurants around the globe.
