Green Communications connects the firefighters of Ille-et-Vilaine (France)

   The call for tenders of the fire department of Ille-et-Villaine (SDIS
   35) for a stand-alone Wi-Fi mesh network is attributed to Green
   Communications.

   In a context of natural or man-made disaster, rescue forces need
   connectivity to make use of the SINUS application for the counting and
   identification of victims. Green Communications proposes a rapid
   deployable Wi-Fi infrastructure composed of a set of weatherproof Wi-Fi
   mesh nodes featuring 19 hours of battery life based on its Green PI low
   power and lightweight mesh devices.

NEW: GREEN PI MOBILE NETWORK

   Green Communications releases a stand-alone mobile Mesh network for the
   rapid set up of an Internet infrastructure with autonomous applications
   and services.

   The system comprises:
     * A set of handheld Mesh routers (YOI)
     * Batteries of 20h autonomy and more
     * A YOI-4G/LTE to connect Green PI to other networks
     * Embedded applications (Voice and video over IP, chat, file storage,
       web, etc.) for autonomous work.

   Within minutes, one can extend the coverage of a private LTE or a
   mobile 4G network inside buildings, tunnels and to remote areas by
   simply turning ON the YOI devices. This sets a Green PI network up
   providing both local-based services and global Internet access through
   the YOI-4G/LTE gateway.

   Green Communications delivers customized Green PI Mobile Networks with
