Mobile Blogging: My Portable Blog Writing Kit

   posted on June 16, 2008

   Nokia n95 [2326679230_736c183a8b_m.jpg] Last week I put a message on
   Twitter that prompted a couple of people to ask for more details:

     On way to sunny Reading, fighting through traffic and rain to see a
     client, writing blog posts on the road and trying to not feel car
     sick

   Yes, I was literally “blogging on the road” and it seems other people
   would like to do the same, so here is how I do it.

   My setup is comprised:
     * Macbook
     * Nokia n95
     * 3G mobile internet tariff

   The Mac talks to the phone over bluetooth and uses the 3G connection
   for connectivity. In the UK data costs are pretty expensive so I have
   recently switched from o2 and now have 1gb of data and more calls than
   I need for much less. It pays to shop around. Even better, my n95 also
   has Skype loaded, which is completely free while I am in the UK due to
   a deal with my new phone plan provider, 3. Overseas I still pay through
   the nose, but luckily outside the British Isles most countries have
   heard of free wifi.

   While I have a spare battery for my laptop when flying, I also have a
   british plug to car power socket adapter that allows me to plug in
   pretty much any device and get power on the move. Sometimes I even
   remember to take it along.

   I have been blogging while on travels for a few years but my setup has
   changed a fair bit, as you can see from this old post at Performancing

     My equipment has a much more Microsoft flavour. My humble Samsung
     V25 laptop runs XP Pro, plus I have a O2 XDA Exec Pocket PC (a
     rebadged HTC running Windows Mobile 2005 for Pocket PC). For voice I
     have Skype both on my laptop (I use a $9 Skype earpiece/microphone,
     nothing so posh as Nicks headset) and also on my Pocket PC. The PDA
     is actually a phone, but I only use it for data and Skype as I have
     a Sony Ericsson K750i for normal cellular voice calls.

   The n95 is a great phone for bloggers, and with it even without the
   laptop I am pretty connected, just a shame it doesn’t have a full
   keyboard like my old PDA. When we were in Chicago for SOBCon, Twitter
   was the main way to stay in contact, so being able to get web access
   from anywhere (mobile or wifi) is a boon. Try the mobile interface or
   TinyTwitter. In addition, IM tools are becoming an essential part of
   work life, I have been trialling eBuddy for MSN, etc, but it doesn’t
   seem to like the ‘@’ in my AIM account screen name.

   I am looking at the new 3G iPhone quite closely, although I expect I
   might have to stick with the n95 as it sounds like Apple will still not
   allow you to hook the iPhone up to a computer to act as a modem which
   is pretty important for my use.

   While I haven’t got this mobile blogging thing down to a fine art like
   Lorelle, my setup does show it is possible to be pretty portable with
   your blogging.

   Do you blog while on your travels?
