   Dinner in the Sky Dubai with Arzo Travels

   Hi, I am Arzo. I have been running this blog since 2015. I often travel
   solo, I am a bit crazy, a bit normal, at times confused and spontaneous
   but my trips turn out fun- even with all the weird things happening in
   between. Always on the hunt for good vegetarian food and amazing views!
   Here you will find real travel tips (mostly not sponsored and paid by
   myself). I am actually a middle-school teacher in Germany but took a
   break and blog full-time now and in between traveling the world
   (sometimes with my puppy – who is also named Puppy).
