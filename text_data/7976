   A Field Guide to “Fake News” and Other Information Disorders explores
   the use of digital methods to study false viral news, political memes,
   trolling practices and their social life online.

   It responds to an increasing demand for understanding the interplay
   between digital platforms, misleading information, propaganda and viral
   content practices, and their influence on politics and public life in
   democratic societies.

   It is a project of the Public Data Lab with support from First Draft.
