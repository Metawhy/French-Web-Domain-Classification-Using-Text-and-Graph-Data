The reason we exist is so that advertisers and website owners can gain
actionable insight to drive efficiency and relevancy across the customer
journey.
We do not sell the data we hold, neither do we know who you are personally.
We only know it's the same person if we see you again.

Privacy Policy



Information that we collect

   We collect information to enable our clients to provide better services
   to their visitors/clients – from figuring out basic stuff like which
   language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find
   most useful. The full list of actual data we collect can be found at
   the top of this page.
   We collect information in the following ways:
   Information we get from your use of our or clients' services. We
   collect information about the services that you use and how you use
   them, like when you watch a video, visit a website that uses our
   advertising services or view and interact with our client ads and
   content. This information includes:

Device information

   We collect device-specific information (such as your device model,
   operating system version, device type).

Location information

   When you use iSite monitored services, we will collect and process
   information about your location. We use your IP address to determine
   your location to an accuracy of approximately 5 miles.

Cookies and similar technologies

   We and our partners/clients use various technologies to collect and
   store information when you visit a iSite service/site, and this may
   include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser
   or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store
   information when you interact with services/sites we offer to our
   partners/clients, such as advertising services or iSite features that
   may appear on other sites. Our clickstream Analytics (iSite) product
   helps businesses and site owners analyse the traffic to their websites
   and apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising tracking
   services, iSiteAds information is linked, by iSite, using Ignition AI
   technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.
   Information we collect when you are signed in to an iSite monitored
   service/site, in addition to information we obtain about you from
   partners, may be associated with your iSite data. When information is
   associated with your iSite data, we treat it as personal information.

How we use information that we collect

   We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide,
   maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones and to protect
   iSite and our users/clients.
   We may use your iSite cookie across all of the services we offer that
   use iSite. In addition, we may replace past IDs associated with your
   iSite data, so that you are represented consistently across all our
   services.
   We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like
   pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of
   our services used by our clients. One of the products we use to do this
   is our own iSite service.

Information that you share

   Remember that when you share information publicly on a service/site, it
   may be indexable by search engines and research technologies, including
   iSite.

Opting out of iSite

   You can opt out of iSite from this URL: https://www.isitelab.io/#optout
   We do not collect Personaly Identifiable Information (PII) hence if you
   email us and ask for the data we have on you, we won't be able to
   provide anything as we don't know who you are. We require your cookie
   ID to be able to extract any data and a payment of £10 for this to be
   processed: Pay via PayPal

Information that we share

For external processing

   We do not share data with 3rd parties.

For legal reasons

   We will share data with companies, organisations or individuals outside
   iSite if we have a belief in good faith that access, use, preservation
   or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
   meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
   governmental request.
   enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of
   potential violations.
   detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
   issues.
   protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of iSite, our
   users or the public, as required or permitted by law.
   We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with
   our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For
   example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the
   general use of our services.
   If iSite is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will
   continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and
   give affected users notice before personal information is transferred
   or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Information security

   We work hard to protect iSite and our clients and users from
   unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or
   destruction of information that we hold. In particular:
   We encrypt all of our services using SSL.
   We review our information collection, storage and processing practices,
   including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorised
   access to systems.
   We restrict access to data to iSite employees, contractors and agents
   who need to know that information in order to process it for us and who
   are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. They may
   be disciplined or their contract terminated if they fail to meet these
   obligations.

When this Privacy Policy applies

   Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by iSite and
   its affiliates, services iSite provides on mobile devices, and services
   offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes
   services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate
   this Privacy Policy.
   Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other
   companies or individuals, sites that may include iSite services or
   other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover
   the information practices of other companies and organisations that
   advertise our services and that may use cookies, pixel tags and other
   technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.

Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities

   We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we
   receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made
   the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory
   authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve
   any complaints regarding the transfer of data that we cannot resolve
   with our users directly.

Changes

   Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce
   your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We
   will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes
   are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including,
   for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). We
   will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for
   your review.
