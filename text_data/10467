About YIS

   Yangon International School is a co-educational private college
   preparatory school located in a suburb of Yangon, Myanmar.  YIS seeks
   to foster the development of the whole child: one who is academically
   well prepared, socially responsible, culturally sensitive and
   personally fulfilled.

   Yangon International School is a co-educational, private, college
   preparatory school located in Yangon, Myanmar. The school’s driving
   mission is to foster the development of the whole child: one who is
   academically well prepared, socially responsible, culturally sensitive
   and personally fulfilled. YIS is the culminating vision of the owner, U
   Tin Maung Win, who wanted to create a school with an American
   curriculum to prepare young people in Myanmar to study overseas.

   The school opened in the fall of 2004 with 86 students. YIS now has
   over 560 students from pre-school to grade 12. Most students are
   Burmese nationals, although the student body grows more international
   as Yangon becomes more cosmopolitan. The first class graduated in 2009.
   YIS is located on two beautifully landscaped campuses.

   YIS facilities are modern and include an air-conditioned gym, swimming
   pool, playgrounds and a nine-story instructional building as well as an
   early childhood campus. There are multiple IT labs and Wi-Fi is
   available throughout the campus. In addition, there is a spacious
   library, three science labs, a large multi-purpose room, a performing
   arts floor, a fitness center, and four art rooms. Construction has
   begun on a new, state of the art addition.

   As the school has grown, more high school courses have been added,
   including 12 Advanced Placement courses, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and
   ESL. Through grades 2 to 10, students take the Measures of Academic
   Progress (MAP) tests. The PSAT is required in grade 11. All seniors in
   grade 12 take the SAT.

   There are 56 certified foreign teachers mostly from the United States,
   as well as from Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand; two
   guidance counselors; two ESL teachers; a Myanmar Studies department;
   and a staff of teaching assistants. Many teachers have advanced degrees
   and several years of teaching experience.

   Yangon International School has been awarded a Six Year Accreditation
   from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).  The
   school has a continuous review cycle to ensure that the accreditation
   standards and recommendations are met.
