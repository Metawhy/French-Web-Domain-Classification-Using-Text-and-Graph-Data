   The modern twists on classics was exciting and it delivered on flavour
   too which is a key factor when playing around with tradition. Can’t
   wait to go back to try other dishes.

   It's a crazy busy week for this mum with a bad bout of flu, school hols
   etc... and a little help in the kitchen from great quality products can
   go a long way in putting up healthy dinners everynight. For tonight's
   dinner, I decided on a simple crumbed chicken sandwich using Ingham's
   free range chicken tenderloins (with wholemeal & quinoa crumb) and a
   homemade spicy slaw. Really moist and tender chicken with a delicious
   crispy crumb; the wholemeal & quinoa adds an interesting texture and
   ofcourse nutritious too. #thespiceadventuress @inghamschicken
