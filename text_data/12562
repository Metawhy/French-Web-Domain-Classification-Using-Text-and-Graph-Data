Kate Tries The 5 AM Club (So You Don’t Have To)

   This summer, while searching for a way to better structure my limited
   time and energy, I decided to try an experiment: waking up at 5 a.m.
   every morning to fit in a bit of exercise, a bit of journaling, and a
   bit of reading—time for myself, essentially, before the rest of my
   family was awake. It’s been more than a month since I first tried The 5
   AM Club, and folks, I hate to say it…I’m actually enjoying it. Today
   I’m sharing the nitty-gritty details of how week one went, in all its
   tired yet transformative glory.

Kate Tries The 5 AM Club (So You Don’t Have To)

   This summer, while searching for a way to better structure my limited
   time and energy, I decided to try an experiment: waking up at 5 a.m.
   every morning to fit in a bit of exercise, a bit of journaling, and a
   bit of reading—time for myself, essentially, before the rest of my
   family was awake. It’s been more than a month since I first tried The 5
   AM Club, and folks, I hate to say it…I’m actually enjoying it. Today
   I’m sharing the nitty-gritty details of how week one went, in all its
   tired yet transformative glory.
