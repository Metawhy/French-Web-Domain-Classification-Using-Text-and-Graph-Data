Stark Photographs by Benjamin Dimmitt Show the Ecological Damage of Saltwater
Encroachment in Florida’s Wetlands

October 8, 2019

Laura Staugaitis

   All photographs © Benjamin Dimmitt, shared with permission of the
   artist

   An Unflinching Look, a documentary photo series by Benjamin Dimmitt, is
   set in Florida and focuses its gaze on rising sea levels. Dimmitt has
   been photographing in the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge north
   of Tampa since 2004, after an initial visit more than 30 years ago.

   “The dense palm hammocks and hardwood forests were festooned with ferns
   and orchids and the fresh water creeks were a clear azure,” Dimmitt
   tells Colossal. But, around 2011, saltwater began leaching into the
   creeks, due to rising sea levels and the state’s environmental
   decision-makers. Florida’s water commissioners allowed more fresh water
   to be drawn into large-scale inland developments and agricultural
   interests, leaving less for wetlands in the aquifers that feed these
   essential ecosystems.

   “What had been verdant, semi-tropical forest is now mostly an open
   plain of grasses relieved by palms and dying hardwood trees,” Dimmitt
   explains. “In 2014, I began to photograph in the salt-damaged sawgrass
   savannas and spring creeks there as a way of reckoning with the
   ecosystem loss and of understanding what has become of my native
   Florida. I have narrowed my focus to a small, remote area that I know
   and love. My intention in bearing witness to this loss has been to
   portray the ruined landscape with respect, nuance and beauty.”

   In order to create each photograph, Dimmitt canoes into the wetlands,
   stepping on to land to set up his tripod when possible, or shooting
   from his canoe if the water is too deep or land too soft. The
   selenium-toned gelatin silver prints are created with a medium format
   camera. Dimmitt grew up in a creative household, and his mother was an
   abstract painter. She gave the photographer his own camera at age 16,
   and her aesthetic continues to inform Dimmitt’s own practice to this
   day.

   Because Dimmitt has been working in this region for so long, he is able
   to show the dramatic changes in the landscape over time, as
   salt-intolerant vegetation has been wiped out by the encroaching ocean
   water, as documented in the diptychs shown here. The artist tells
   Colossal that he has a very direct approach to photography, shooting
   from his eye and his heart. He sought to channel “a hammer in a velvet
   glove,” creating compelling images that would draw viewers into the
   larger issues at stake. As part of his artistic practice, Dimmitt also
   researched saltwater intrusion and spoke with scientists, activists,
   state water management officials, and locals to gain a full picture of
   the situation. For the photographer, the experience of documenting the
   changes in Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge “has been painful
   and cathartic for me, evoking grief, anger and feelings of loss and
   mortality.”

   An Unflinching Look is part of a current exhibition, “This is Climate
   Change,” now on view at Southeast Museum of Photography through October
   26, 2019. Explore more of the photographer’s portfolio on his website
   and Instagram. You can also learn more about the buyouts that state
   governments in regions impacted by climate change are offering people
   to leave their homes in an incisive article on Bloomberg.

Embroidered Calligraphy by Olga Kovalenko Plays with Notions of Time and
Gesture

October 8, 2019

Laura Staugaitis

   “Kafkaesque”

   Embroidery and calligraphy merge in Olga Kovalenko’s gestural stitched
   lettering. Evoking the style of loose, ink-splattering calligraphy,
   Kovalenko replicates each speck of “ink” in carefully places, minuscule
   stitches. The artist shares with Colossal, “the main idea in this
   project was to connect two arts—the fast (expressive calligraphy) and
   the slow one (hand embroidery). It makes you think about the
   deceitfulness of time.” Kovalenko studied type design at Moscow State
   University of Printing Arts, and pursued further calligraphy studies
   with Evgeniy Dobrovinsky. See more of her multi-media lettering work on
   Behance and Instagram. (via Colossal Submissions)

Remote Landscapes Illuminated by Geometric Drone Flight Paths in Photographs
by Reuben Wu

October 7, 2019

Laura Staugaitis

   Chicago-based artist Reuben Wu (previously) blurs the lines between
   photography and art in his unique images. Wu’s work brings him to
   remote locations around the world to capture rugged landscapes. But
   rather than focusing on purely documenting local topography, Wu uses
   lighted drones to create geometric shapes in the air, accenting the
   natural surroundings. Featured here are images from Wu’s Lux Noctis and
   Aeroglyphs series, showcasing the artist’s interplay of organic and
   constructed shapes.

   “Lux Noctis started as a means to present landscapes in a different way
   to conventional photography. The use of artificial lighting in a
   natural landscape came to me at Trona Pinnacles in 2014 when a random
   truck drove into my time lapse, unexpectedly illuminating the pinnacles
   in a way that shouldn’t exist,” Wu tells Colossal. “This expanded into
   the idea of introducing my own look and feel to a landscape using very
   nuanced aerial lighting. Rather than rely on the sun, and timing, to
   light my images, I was able to light it myself, like I would in a
   studio environment.” For his most recent Lux Noctis images, Wu traveled
   to Bolivia with sponsorship from Phase One, to use the company’s new XT
   camera platform.

   For Aeroglyphs, the artist draws inspiration from the Land Art movement
   to create interventions without physically touching the earth. Images
   from the series are currently on view at photo-eye in Santa Fe, New
   Mexico through November 16, 2019. A catalogue from the show is
   available for preorder from Kris Graves Projects. Stay up to date with
   Wu’s new work and travels on Instagram and Facebook.

   Wu traveled to Chile to document the eclipse as part of his “Arca Lux”

A Swedish Art Collective Handcrafts 17,000 Unique Sculptures Signifying
Refugee Youth at Risk of Deportation

October 7, 2019

Laura Staugaitis

   Photography: Felix Gerlach and Martin Spencer

   Seventeen thousand unique sculptures are displayed in a new
   installation by Swedish artist collective Skaparkollektivet Forma. The
   group sought to draw attention to the individuality of 17,000 Afghan
   refugee youth whom the Swedish government plans to deport. The
   unaccompanied minors came to Sweden in 2015, totaling 23,500 in that
   year, and were fully integrated into their adoptive communities.
   However, the government seems to have shifted gears and has reversed
   its opinions on a majority of the young people.

   Working with 1,500 volunteers, Skaparkollektivet Forma created petite
   sculptural works of art to represent each individual impacted by the
   planned governmental uprooting. The works are glued to 34 frames in
   groups of 500, which allows the installation to be easily transported
   and installed in different configurations.

   Since the collective started working on this project, attention has
   been drawn to the issue, and some of the youth have been allowed to
   stay, but apparently the majority of the planned deportations are still
   set to happen. “In the debate on migration, living human beings tend to
   be transformed into anonymous volumes,” said Skaparkollektivet Forma
   told dezeen. “But we wanted to understand what this five-figure number
   actually represented. The installation makes the number 17,000 visible
   and above all shows that behind every number there is a person,” they
   explained. “Behind each figure there is a personality, a story, a work
   of art.”

   The work was initially displayed at Liljevalchs art gallery, which is
   an independent, public gallery in Stockholm. Follow the collective on
   Instagram and Facebook for updates. (via dezeen)

A Photographic Survey by Jessica Wynne of Chalkboards Filled by
Mathematicians

October 6, 2019

Andrew LaSane

   Poincaré in Paris. Images courtesy of Jessica Wynne

   Photographer and Fashion Institute of Technology professor Jessica
   Wynne has spent the last year documenting the numbers, symbols, and
   models drawn by mathematicians onto chalkboards. The photos capture the
   thought processes and physical efforts of professionals in a medium
   that has been largely abandoned.

   Wynne tells Colossal that she enjoys photographing the dusty work
   surfaces because of “their beauty, mystery and the pleasure of creating
   a permanent document of something that is ephemeral.” The “Do Not
   Erase” photo series, soon to be published in a book by Princeton
   University Press for release in 2020, includes boards from institutions
   and universities around the world. Wynne hopes that viewers can
   appreciate the aesthetic of the worked surfaces while “simultaneously
   appreciating that the work on the board represents something much
   deeper, beyond the surface.”

   Wynne adds that she feels a “kinship” with the mathematicians. “Their
   imagination guides them and similar to an artist they have the higher
   aspiration to create, discover, and find truth.” For updates on the
   release of her book and for more interesting photo series, head over to
   Jessica Wynne’s website.

Ironing Wrinkled Chips, Keeping Headphones in Place, and Other Surreal
Life-Hacks Photographed by Gab Bois

October 5, 2019

Andrew LaSane

   Montreal-based artist Gab Bois uses everyday objects to create
   photographs that twist reality and illustrate bizarre, yet clever,
   concepts. Often achieved using post-processing techniques, the seamless
   images depict unnatural double entendres and impossible feats. For the
   artist, the ideas are the star and photography is a tool for
   translation.

   Gab Bois has a degree in fine art but didn’t practice photography until
   after graduating. Finding inspiration in the mundane and random, the
   common thread in Gab Bois’ work is the familiar. The artist prefers
   creating from her own imagination and dreams so that the work feels
   authentic. She tells Colossal that nine times out of ten, she is the
   model in her photographs. “I like to be very hands-on when it comes to
   most aspects of my practice and find it very hard to delegate,” she
   explains. “Being my own subject gives me a sense of control that I
   wouldn’t have with a model.” She has shot other people on occasion, and
   Gab Bois says that those were great learning experiences.

   Gab Bois’ images live on Instagram, but the artist says that they
   “aspire to live a much larger life outside of the platform.” She added
   that Instagram is “a great diffusion tool but it feels reductive to me
   to have my work reside solely in a virtual environment.” The artist
   also has a sculptural practice that lives outside of social media.

   Gab Bois is working on a solo exhibition for 2020. In the more
   immediate future, her work will be featured in a group exhibition
   opening on October 10, 2019 at KK Outlet in London and also in Montreal
   on October 17, 2019. To see more of her ideas come to life, follow the
   artist on Instagram.

Hand-Painted Wood Offcuts Form Colorful Dovetailed Chairs and Benches by
Donna Wilson

October 4, 2019

Laura Staugaitis

   Textile designer Donna Wilson’s newest body of work is a collection of
   colorful chairs and benches called Abstract Assembly. The designer, who
   you may be familiar with through her quirky plush characters like Rita
   Radish and Lenny Leopard, debuted her new venture into hard goods at
   this year’s London Design Festival.

   The vibrant, multi-part chair backs are translated from Wilson’s
   watercolor paintings and use offcuts of oak, beech, and Douglas fir
   wood. Each design is a limited edition of ten. All components are
   hand-painted by Wilson and then dovetailed together (she partnered with
   Jon Almond on production). Design Milk quoted Wilson’s creative
   exploration that sparked the Abstract Assembly collection:

     A year ago I embarked on a new direction with the main purpose to
     satisfy my creativity. I finally managed to stand back from what I
     was doing with my company and see what I needed to do. With no idea
     where it would take me, I started drawing and painting in the
     evenings. The next step was for me to bring these abstract doodle to
     life and start working in wood, I wanted to make hand-assembled
     pieces using traditional carpentry techniques and luckily my partner
     Jon was able to help me develop these pieces into a collection of
     chairs and mirrors.

   See more from the Scottish designer on her website, where you can pick
   up a chair of your own, or peruse the wide array of Wilson’s
   fabric-based designs. You can also follow the company on Instagram and
   Twitter. (thnx, Kate!)

Chicago Artist Mends Potholes with Mosaics

May 30, 2014

Christopher Jobson

   bachor_2kenneth3

   After one of the most brutal winters in over 30 years, Chicago’s
   streets are pockmarked with an estimated 600,000 gaping potholes,
   making some streets almost impassable and raising the ire of residents
   citywide. The issue is so prevalent that the city even created a
   dedicated Pothole Tracker that shows potholes patched by the Department
   of Transportation over the last seven days. But some Chicagoans are
   more proactive and aren’t content to wait for help. One such person is
   artist Jim Bachor who has taken to filling potholes with original tile
   mosaics.

   Inspired in part by trips to view ancient art in Italy during the
   1990’s, Bachor has been creating mosaic work for several years, though
   of a much more whimsical nature. Think mosaics of coffee cups,
   twinkies, and boxes of cereal. For his pothole project Bachor has
   filled about 7 potholes with his original artwork that borrows from the
   design of the Chicago flag. While some of the mosaics simply read
   POTHOLE others are given unique ID numbers or include the phone number
   to nearby auto repair shops (the city has received 1,100 claims of car
   damage due to potholes this season). Bachor says the tongue-in-cheek
   approach is meant more as a sense of civic pride than a form of
   complaint against the city, as the potholes are an inevitable part of
   living in Chicago.

   Bachor hopes to do a few more pieces in the near future, though each
   mosaic costs around $50 to make and takes a considerable amount of time
   to prepare and install. Also, the resulting patch is temporary; these
   aren’t meant as a permanent fix. You can read more about the project
   over on Hyperallergic, and you can see more of Jim’s work at the
   Thorndale Red Line stop in a few months. (via Hyperallergic)

   Publish or Perish was a 2009 show at Mark Moore Gallery in Santa Monica
