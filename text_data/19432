What Is The Barnett Shale?

   View All Topics »

Background

     * Tweet
     *

   The Barnett Shale is a geological formation and rich source of natural
   gas located in the Fort Worth Basin in Northeast Texas. The shale
   consists of sedimentary rock made of clay and quartz and spans 5,000
   square miles, beneath about 18 North Texas counties. The productive
   portion of the rock formation is located directly beneath Johnson,
   Tarrant and western Dallas counties, about a mile and a half
   underground. The shale contains an estimated 40 trillion cubic feet of
   natural gas, making it the largest onshore natural gas field in Texas
   and potentially in the United States.

   The first well on the Barnett Shale was drilled in 1981 by Mitchell
   Energy. Drilling technology at that time didn’t allow for natural gas
   production in commercial quantities. Recent advances in drilling
   techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have
   enabled energy producers to extract gas from the Barnett Shale more
   efficiently and economically. Today thousands of natural gas wells
   pepper the landscape above the shale, making it an economically
   significant area for the state of Texas.

   The use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on many of the wells has
   sparked some controversy in recent years, as critics of the drilling
   method have questioned its impact on nearby water supplies.

   There have been earthquakes linked to injection wells in the
   Dallas-Fort Worth area. Those quakes are linked to drilling in Barnett
   Shale. The productive portion of the Barnett Shale is located directly
   beneath Johnson, Tarrant and western Dallas counties, about a mile and
   a half underground. The shale contains an estimated 40 trillion cubic
   feet of natural gas, making it the largest onshore natural gas field in
   Texas and potentially in the United States.

   Since its discovery, the Barnett Shale has produced an estimated 4.8
   trillion cubic feet of natural gas. A 2007 study by the Perryman Group
   suggests activity at the Barnett Shale is expected to create 108,000
   jobs and produce $10.4 billion in revenue by the year 2015.

With governor’s signature, Maryland becomes third state to ban fracking

   Maryland banned fracking for oil and natural gas at sites like this in
   Dimock, Pa.

   Scott Detrow / StateImpact PA

   Maryland banned fracking for oil and natural gas at sites like this in
   Dimock, Pa.

   Maryland Governor Larry Hogan on Tuesday signed a bill banning
   fracking, making his state the third after New York and Vermont to
   prevent the controversial process of oil and gas extraction.

   Hogan, a Republican, said in March that he would back the bill that was
   passed at the end of that month by both houses of the
   Democrat-controlled state legislature.

   “Because of Maryland’s position in the country and our wealth of
   natural resources, our administration has concluded that possible
   environmental risks of fracking outweigh any potential benefits,” Hogan
   said, according to the Associated Press.

   The ban, which goes into effect on Oct. 1 this year, stops any
   development of the Marcellus Shale, which underlies the western portion
   of Maryland as well as much of neighboring Pennsylvania and West
   Virginia.

   The Maryland Petroleum Council, a division of the American Petroleum
   Institute, condemned the state legislature’s final passage of the bill
   banning fracking on March 27.

   “This politically motivated decision moves Maryland further away from
   the state’s economic and environmental goals,” said Drew Cobbs, the
   council’s executive director, in a statement.

   “Denying Maryland consumers, businesses and job-seekers the benefits
   that come with in-state energy production through hydraulic fracturing
   shuts the door on an important share in the American energy renaissance
   and Western Maryland’s future economic growth,” Cobbs said.

   Opponents of fracking said the Maryland ban was inspired by the harm
   they said has been caused by the practice in Pennsylvania where
   thousands of wells have been drilled into the Marcellus Shale over the
   last decade. The critics urged Governor Tom Wolf to also ban fracking.

   “Maryland’s governor has proactively stopped fracking before it could
   ruin the state’s water, air and communities,” said Tracy Carluccio of
   the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental group. “Here in
   Pennsylvania, we have living proof of the indelible damage that
   fracking brings and yet Governor Wolf won’t even acknowledge what is
   occurring.

   “We call on Governor Wolf to listen to his neighboring states of
   Maryland and New York and stop fracking,” Carluccio said.

   Wolf’s spokesman, J.J. Abbott, said the governor believes he can
   protect the environment and create jobs by developing natural gas
   reserves.

   “He is focused on what he can control: ensuring smart, comprehensive
   environmental protection and enhancing technology and capacity for
   regulation,” Abbott said in a statement. “Under his leadership, DEP has
   pursued aggressive and important regulations on fracking and methane.”
