WELCOME TO ALLIANCE FRANCAISE DE CEBU!

   It is a ‚ÄúPetite France‚Äù in Cebu where anybody can enter without a visa
   and mingle with the French culture. ‚ÄúAlliance Francaise de Cebu‚Äù is a
   Filipino association of ‚ÄúFrancophile‚Äù women and men from various
   nationalities. Located in the very heart of the Visayan Capital, a
   stone‚Äôs throw from the Ayala Center, Alliance Francaise de Cebu is a
   genuine international meeting place. People from highly diverse
   backgrounds, with highly diverse sets of interests (cultural,
   professional etc.) come together from all over the globe.

   The language center is open to everyone willing to learn or polish
   their French . Exhibits and events organised in the cultural center
   will interest those who want to know more about this far away country,
   and be at the avant-garde of a long and traditional culture.

WHAT IS AN ALLIANCE FRANCAISE?

   An Alliance Francaise is a local non-stock, non-profit organization
   related to Fondation Alliance, in Paris, created more than 120 years
   ago, in 1883. Since then, the network expanded and counts actually 1071
   centers all over the world. Alliance Francaise is tightly working with
   the French Foreign Affairs Department and as a matter of fact with the
   French Embassy.

   The main goals of Alliance Francaise are :
     * teaching French
     * organizing cultural events
     * developing intercultural dialogue
     * promoting cultural goods such as books, movies, exhibition

   Francaise.
