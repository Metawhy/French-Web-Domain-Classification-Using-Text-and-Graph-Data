Texas Instruments INA185 Current Sense Amplifier

     * View Details
     * More About Texas Instruments
     * View Datasheet

   Texas Instruments INA185 Current Sense Amplifier is designed for use in
   cost-sensitive space-constrained applications. This device is a
   bidirectional, current-sense amplifier (also called a current-shunt
   monitor). The INA185 senses voltage drop across a current-sense
   resistor at common-mode voltages from –0.2V to +26V, independent of the
   supply voltage. The INA185 integrates a matched resistor gain network
   in four, fixed-gain device options: 20V/V, 50V/V, 100V/V, or 200V/V.
   This matched gain resistor network minimizes gain error and reduces the
   temperature drift.

   The INA185 operates from a single 2.7V to 5.5V power supply. The device
   draws a maximum supply current of 260µA and features a high slew rate.
   The INA185 also has a high bandwidth making this device an excellent
   choice for many power-supply and motor-control applications.

Features

     * SOT-563 package (1.6mm×1.6mm)
          + 39% smaller footprint than SC70
          + 0.55mm package height
     * Common-mode range (V[CM]): –0.2V to +26V
     * High bandwidth: 350kHz (A1 devices)
     * Offset voltage
          + ±55µV (max) at V[CM] = 0V
          + ±100µV (max) at V[CM] = 12V (A4 device)
     * Output slew rate: 2V/µs
     * Bidirectional current-sensing capability

     * Accuracy
          + ±0.2% maximum gain error (A1, A2, A3)
          + 0.5µV/°C maximum offset drift
     * Gain options
          + 20V/V (A1 devices)
          + 50V/V (A2 devices)
          + 100V/V (A3 devices)
          + 200V/V (A4 devices)
     * Quiescent current: 260µA (max)

Applications

     * Motor control
     * Battery monitoring
     * Power management

     * Lighting control
     * Overcurrent detection
     * Solar inverters

     * More About Analog Devices Inc.

   Analog Devices Inc. EV-ADF5610SD1Z Evaluation Board is used to evaluate
   ADF5610 frequency synthesizer. The evaluation board features the
   ADF5610 synthesizer with integrated voltage controlled oscillator
   (VCO). It also features a low noise, single-ended, 50MHz voltage
   controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) reference. An HMC1031 Integer N
   PLL, a switch, a jumper, a loop filter, a USB interface, and
   subminiature Version A (SMA) connectors are also integrated.

   The EV-ADF5610SD1Z evaluation board requires a SDP-S controller board,
   which is not included with the kit. The SDP-S allows software
   programming of the ADF5610 device through a USB interface.

Features

     * Self contained board, including ADF5610 frequency synthesizer with
       integrated VCO, single-ended, 50MHz VCXO, PLL jitter clean up
       circuit, loop filter (4kHz), USB interface, and voltage regulators
     * Windows-based software allows control of synthesizer functions from
       a PC
     * Externally powered by a single 6V supply

     * EQUIPMENT NEEDED
          + Windows-based PC with USB port for evaluation software
          + System demonstration platform, SDP-S
          + EVAL-SDP-CS1Z controller board
          + Micro USB cable
          + Power supply (6V)
          + 50Ω terminations
          + Signal source analyzer
