HubPages Network Privacy Policy

   This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 14, 2018, and is effective
   May 24, 2018. See the bottom of this page for recent changes to this
   Privacy Policy.

   feltmagnet.com is part of the HubPages Service.

   The following information is to help users and visitors (collectively
   “Users” or “You”) understand how we collect, use, disseminate and
   safeguard the information You provide to us while accessing and using
   our HubPages software, services, the website at FeltMagnet (the
   “Website”), and any other websites and services as may be added from
   time to time (collectively, the “Service”). We will not use or share
   Your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
   Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by
   other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized
   terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning
   given them in our Terms of Use. By using the HubPages Service, you
   expressly consent to the practices and activities described in this
   document.

   For users impacted by GDPR please see the GDPR Addendum For Impacted
   Users section below.

1. Information We Collect

   We collect the following information:

   a. User Provided Information. You may provide certain personally
   identifiable information to HubPages directly, such as Your first and
   last name, telephone number, address, tax information (such as a Social
   Security Number), credit card or PayPal® information, and email address
   (collectively, “Personally Identifiable Information”) when choosing to
   register, to purchase through the Service, to participate in promotions
   or surveys, or to subscribe to any newsletters or other distribution
   lists. You may also choose to provide us with Personally Identifiable
   Information in your User Content.

   When You use our Service, we may collect and store information about
   Your use, including the following:

   b. Cookies. When You visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies
   – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to
   your computer that identifies your web browser. You can set your web
   browser to refuse cookies; however, this may limit the functionality
   our Service can provide to You.

   c. Log Files. Log file information is automatically reported by your
   web browser each time You view a web page. When You register with or
   use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information
   that your web browser sends whenever You visit a website. These server
   logs may include information such as your IP address, browser type and
   language, number of clicks, domain names of websites visited, pages
   viewed, and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on
   particular pages, the date and time.

   d. Clear Gifs. When You use the Service, we may use clear gifs (a.k.a.
   web beacons) which are pieces of data used to track the online usage
   patterns of our Users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear
   gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are
   opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate
   reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make
   HubPages better for our Users.

   Information collected through clear gifs and cookies, and log file
   information is largely non-personally identifiable information because
   such information is not collected or used in such a way that an
   individual User can be identified, for example, by name or email
   address (collectively, “Non-Personally Identifiable Information”).
   Collected information may be Personally Identifiable Information or
   Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

   e. Third-party service-based information. This includes linked services
   (such as Facebook Connect) that You authorize to share information
   about You with HubPages. If You elect to use Facebook Connect with
   HubPages, You agree that HubPages may use (as described in Section 2)
   information about You provided by Facebook, including (but is not
   limited to) Your: name, email, gender, birthday, current city, profile
   picture URL, as well as any additional information (such as “Like”
   information) that You specifically consent for HubPages to access and
   use.

   Other third-party supported services, such as Google Analytics, that
   You might use on the Service may collect information through similar
   methods. Such information is not shared with us and is subject to the
   privacy policy of each such third-party service.

   Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data for
   advertising purposes (such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google
   Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and
   Interest Reporting), including the collection of data via advertising
   cookies and identifiers. For information about opting out of Google
   Analytics see the currently available Google Analytics opt-out tool.

   You may also opt-out of receiving targeted ads from third party
   advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising
   Initiative (NAI) with the NAI tool available here.

2. Use of Information

   Collected information is used to operate, maintain, and provide to You
   the features and functionality of the Service.

   We may use your Personally Identifiable Information for billing
   purposes, payment purposes (including any tax-related purposes),
   administrative purposes, such as notifying You of major changes in
   Service, news, and for other customer service purposes. You hereby
   consent to our use of your email address to send you such information.
   Also, we may provide credit card and ordering information to payment
   processors, including Paypal®, but we do not retain such information.

   We may use collected information to: (a) remember information so that
   You will not have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent
   visits to the Service; (b) provide custom, personalized content and
   information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;
   (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and
   traffic; (e) track User Content, and status in any promotions,
   sweepstakes, and contests; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g)
   access your information after You sign in; (h) market our Service to
   advertisers and other third parties; (i) to improve the quality and
   design of the Service and to create new features by storing, tracking,
   and analyzing your preferences and trends; and (j) verify your identity
   for payment and taxation purposes.

   The HubPages account screen name/username and/or subdomain name that
   you select will be displayed on the Service.

3. When We Disclose Information

   We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third
   parties solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we
   do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by
   this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations
   outside the direct control of HubPages (for instance, on servers or
   databases co-located with hosting providers).

   Any information or User Content submitted, transmitted, or uploaded to
   the public areas of the Service becomes publicly available and can be
   collected and used by other Users, who may forward this information or
   User Content to other websites or people.. Be aware that if Your User
   Content includes personal information, such as your name and email
   address, other Users will have access to it. If Your User Content is a
   photograph, please be aware that all photographs uploaded to the
   Service reside on public URLs. Any person who knows the URL of Your
   photograph can access the photograph, whether or not it’s published on
   a Hub. Your photograph will remain displayed on such URL after You
   delete it from Your Hub. Please do not upload any photographs that You
   do not want to be public information.

   If You request to participate in the Amazon Program under HubPages, You
   acknowledge that Amazon may require personal information about You to
   with respect to Your participation in the program (for fraud monitoring
   and other possible reasons), and You agree that HubPages may disclose
   to Amazon such personal information about You that Amazon requires,
   including (but not limited to) Your: name, email, phone number,
   address, and country.

   In order to describe our Service to prospective partners, advertisers
   and other third parties we may disclose aggregate user information. We
   share Non-Personally Identifiable Information (such as anonymous use
   data) with third parties to assist them in understanding our Service,
   including Users’ use of our Service and the success of promotions.

   We may release collected information if required to do so by law, or if
   we believe that such action is appropriate to comply with state and
   federal laws or respond to a court order, law enforcement request or
   demand, subpoena, or search warrant. We may disclose collected
   information to applicable entities (for example, the Internal Revenue
   Service and third party payment providers) with respect to payment and
   tax-related purposes. We may also share collected information in order
   to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual
   illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud; potential
   threats to public safety or the physical safety, property, or rights of
   any person; or violations of our Terms of Use.

4. Third-Party Service Providers

   The Service may be used in conjunction with services provided through a
   variety of third parties, such as Google. The use of User Content and
   other information provided by You to such third parties is governed by
   their privacy policies, not our Privacy Policy. HubPages is not
   responsible for such third party privacy policies or their compliance
   with such policies.

   HubPages may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve
   advertisements and/or collect information on the Service. These
   third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly
   to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on HubPages.
   They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may
   also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web
   beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
   personalize the advertising content. HubPages does not provide any
   personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or
   ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an
   advertiser asks HubPages to show an advertisement to a certain audience
   and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may
   conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying
   to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not
   including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about

   advertisements on the Service, other websites and other forms of media
   about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more

5. Choices

   You may update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information at
   any time as indicated on the Service or by sending us an email at
   team@HubPages.com. If You or HubPages intend to delete any User Content
   provided by You, we cannot guarantee that your User Content will be
   completely removed from all User devices or from their web pages, nor
   that other Users will not misuse any content that You supply. In
   addition the other Users may have already copied and forwarded your
   User Content to others, making recovery impossible.

6. Data Security

   We have put in place commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
   technical procedures to protect your Personally Identifiable
   Information and other data from loss, misuse or alteration and to
   safeguard and secure the data You provide. While we strive to protect
   such information after it arrives at our servers, we cannot guarantee
   the security of any information that is being transmitted over the
   Internet, or guarantee that such information may not be accessed,
   disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
   technical, or managerial safeguards. As a result, You provide such
   information at your own risk.

7. Children’s Privacy

   Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that
   reason, we do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information
   submitted by persons under 18 years of age. If You are under 18 years
   of age, then please do not submit any information to the Service at any
   time or in any manner.

8. Merger or Bankruptcy

   In the event that we acquire, are acquired by, or merge with a third
   party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign all collected
   information as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change
   of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy or similar
   situation, we may not be able to control how your information is
   treated, transferred, or used.

9. Changes and Updates

   We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, add or remove
   portions of this policy at any time by posting such changes to this
   page. Such changes will be effective upon posting. Any changes will be

11. GDPR Addendum for Impacted Users

   If you are an end user whose use of the website is covered by the GDPR
   regulations, this section applies to you, and in the event of any
   inconsistency between this section and the remainder of the Privacy
   Policy and or the Terms of Use, this section shall control for you as
   it relates to GDPR.

Personal Data & Purposes:

   The personal data we may collect will be used for the following
   purposes:
     * Functional: Data will be used to provide information, features, and
       services for users of the website (including various automated
       features), to communicate with users, and to make improvements.
     * Statistical: Data will be used to track and analyze usage,
       audience, and performance of the website
     * Provisioning & Security: Data will be used to help us operate,
       host, deliver, maintain and secure the website for users of the
       website
     * Marketing: Data will be used for promotional, targeting,
       monetization, and advertising activities with respect to the
       website

   There are no special categories of personal data specifically collected
   by the service; provided however, that if you as a user freely submits
   any such information to the website, such data may be visible to users
   of the website and such data will be treated similarly to your other
   Author Content and Hub Content.

   For any end user and/or website session that is covered by the GDPR
   regulation, HubPages may elect, in its sole discretion, not to collect
   and/or not to process personal data (beyond such data as used for
   Required purposes for which consent is not required).

Consent

   For those areas of collection and processing of your personal data that
   require consent, consent is deemed valid only upon your giving such
   consent to us explicitly. Where we are asking for your consent, we will
   tell you why and how the information will be used. You may then decide
   what consents (if any) you wish to provide. By consenting to the
   purpose as stated in a consent request, you are giving us permission to
   collect and/or process your personal data specifically for the purposes
   identified.

   Consents will be provided and managed through the consent dialogue tool
   only. Any other request to provide, remove, and/or manage a user’s
   consent will be referred back to the user to go through the consent
   dialogue. You may access the consent dialogue tool and update/remove
   your consents by clicking here.

Required Data

   As allowed under GDPR, certain personal data collection and processing
   may be required. You can view the applicable details in the Necessary
   section of the consent dialogue tool, accessible here.

   Other data is not required. You may decline to share certain personal
   data with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some
   of the features and functionality of the website.

Legal Basis

   Our legal basis for collection and processing of personal data is as
   follows:
     * consent explicitly given by you for the purpose requested;
     * legal compliance and/or vital interest, as mandated by a valid and
       binding request from an applicable government entity with proper
       jurisdiction;
     * contractual performance, for example with respect to activities
       initiated by you on the service (that may involve our third-party
       partners, for example the HubPages Earnings Program or third-party
       content/advertising modules);
     * legitimate interests pursued by us (or third parties we use)
       include specific activities initiated by you on the service and/or
       fraud/anti-spam protection, security, authentication,
       load-balancing, and other fundamental provisioning and protections
       for both registered and unregistered users of the website.

Contact/Manage

   Your rights under the GDPR can be viewed here.

   You may access the consent dialogue tool and update/remove your
   consents by clicking here

   Beyond consent management, please submit GDPR-related data rights or
   other requests via email to: gdpr@hubpages.com

   The Data Controller is HubPages, Inc. You may contact HubPages at:
   Team@hubpages.com

Disclosure of Data Transfer & Third-Parties

   HubPages may pass on your personal data to third parties after first
   obtaining your consent for purposes that you explicitly approve in the
   consent dialogue. You may access this consent dialogue tool and
   update/remove your consents by clicking here

   HubPages may pass on your personal data to third parties without first
   obtaining your consent for purposes allowed under required collection
   and processing under GDPR, including but not limited to where such data
   is required to provide website or user security, authentication,
   fraud-protection, or anti-spam protecting; and/or for a properly
   issued, valid, and binding legal compliance or vital interest requests
   from an entity with proper jurisdiction. You can view the applicable
   details in the Required section of the consent dialogue, accessible
   here.

   Personal data may be processed by us in the country where it was
   collected, as well as other countries (including the United States)
   where laws regarding processing may be less stringent than the laws in
   your country. Where personal data is transferred outside of the EEA to
   a data importer in a country that is not subject to an adequacy
   decision by the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by
   appropriate safeguards, such as industry-standard GDPR-compliant
   contractual clauses with third parties.

Deletions

   GDPR impacted users may have broader data/deletion rights for users
   than specified in the HubPages Terms of Use for all global users.
   Deletions of data, pursuant to properly issued, valid, and verified
   GDPR-related requests from a person or entity with rights to make such
   a request, will occur within a reasonable timeframe; data in backup
   archives that is unlinked may take longer to delete than active data.
