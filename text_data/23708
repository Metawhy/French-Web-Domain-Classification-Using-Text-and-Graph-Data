Best Cherry Tomato Bruschetta

   Jump to RecipePrint Recipe

   This is truly the best cherry tomato bruschetta recipe, and it‚Äôs the
   only one you need. It‚Äôs ultra simple, super quick, and delicious.

   Best Cherry Tomato Bruschetta

   We recently hosted my dad and step mom for the weekend. They came into
   town on a Friday night (we‚Äôre still temporarily living in Milwaukee),
   and I hustled back to meet them after running errands in Chicago.

   I‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs crazy ‚Äúliving‚Äù in two different cities. Our
   appointments (and our stuff) are spread across both cities, and it‚Äôs a
   bit chaotic at times.

   On my way back to MKE to meet them, it dawned on me that we had nothing
   to eat, so I swung by the grocery store and grabbed ingredients for my
   last-minute gathering go-to: bruschetta.

   I wanted to have a little something prepped when they arrived as I knew
   they probably wouldn‚Äôt have eaten yet, but I didn‚Äôt have a whole lot of
   time. And so I whipped together this bruschetta as soon as I arrived
   home.

   My goodness, you would have thought I‚Äôd spent hours in the kitchen had
   you heard their reaction.

   Yummmm.

   Wowww. That‚Äôs so good.

   How‚Äôd you make this?

   You HAVE to send me the recipe.

   So instead of sending it, I‚Äôm sharing it here for the sake of the
   greater good. Because everyone needs a good bruschetta recipe up their
   sleeve.

   I‚Äôve been making this simple bruschetta recipe for the last 10+ years,
   and it‚Äôs always a hit on both ends of the party.

   If you‚Äôre hosting, it is super quick + easy to make, has a wow-factor
   (especially if you use heirloom tomatoes, which tend to come in a
   variety of colors), and is great for both vegans and non-vegans alike.
   If you‚Äôre a guest, it‚Äôs one of those appetizers that‚Äôs light and yet so
   satisfying. Win-win.

   My only recommendation: Make sure everyone at the party enjoys it,
   because it‚Äôs got a garlicky punch. If everyone has a bite, you won‚Äôt
   notice each other‚Äôs garlic breath. üòÇ

   Best Cherry Tomato Bruschetta

   To make it, you‚Äôll start by making the tomato-basil topping.

   TIP: If you‚Äôre making this in the prime of tomato season, you can use
   any variety of ripe tomatoes; however, since we‚Äôre currently off-season
   for tomatoes, I recommend using heirloom cherry or grape tomatoes.
   They‚Äôre reliably sweet, juicy, and flavorful, and they offer a festive
   pop of color.

   Dice your tomatoes as finely as you prefer.

   Chop a handful of fresh basil leaves.

   Add both the tomatoes and basil to a serving bowl. Drizzle with olive
   oil (and a splash of balsamic if you‚Äôd like) and season with sea salt.
   Then, refrigerate the topping until ready to serve. I recommend
   preparing it no more than eight hours in advance.

   Best Cherry Tomato Bruschetta

   Once you‚Äôre ready to serve the bruschetta, preheat your broiler.

   Then, thinly slice a ciabatta baguette or French baguette and spread
   the bread slices out over a baking pan. Brush the top of each with
   olive oil, and season with sea salt.

   Best Cherry Tomato Bruschetta

   Broil the baguette slices for 2‚Äì4 minutes, or until the edges are
   golden brown and the tops feel crisp to the touch.

   Best Cherry Tomato Bruschetta

   Now, here‚Äôs the trick to making authentic bruschetta: Rub the warm
   slices of bread with whole peeled garlic cloves. The garlic melts into
   the surface of each crispy, chewy slice and infuses the most delightful
   garlicky flavor.

   Tuck your toasty bruschetta slices into a cozy bowl, and serve them
   alongside the tomato-basil topping.

   Quick, easy, and delicious.

Ingredients

     * 3 cups heirloom grape or cherry tomatoes, diced
     * Handful fresh basil leaves, chopped
     * Olive oil
     * Sea salt
     * Splash of balsamic vinegar (optional)
     * 1‚Äì2 French baguettes or ciabatta baguettes, sliced into
       1/3-inch-thick pieces*
     * 2‚Äì4 cloves garlic, peeled

Instructions

     * In a medium serving bowl, stir together the cherry tomatoes and
       basil. Drizzle a teaspoon or two of olive oil over top, generously
       sprinkle with salt, and toss to coat. Taste and season with more
       salt, if needed. If desired, add a small splash of balsamic
       vinegar, and toss again. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve
       (can be made up to 8 hours in advance).
     * When ready to serve, preheat the broiler on high.
     * Spread the baguette slices out over a large baking tray and use a
       pastry brush to brush the top of each slice with olive oil.
       Sprinkle the tops with sea salt.
     * Broil the baguette slices for 2‚Äì4 minutes, or until golden brown
       and crisp on top. Then, carefully rub the top of each with the
       garlic (it will melt into the surface of the hot toasts).
     * Serve the warm toasts alongside the tomato basil mixture.

Notes

   *If you use one baguette, you'll likely have leftover tomato topping.
   **The tomato-basil topping can be made up to 8 hours in advance.
