Israel to Hizballah: A crushing Israeli response will come – even for a
“limited reprisal”

   Aug 28, 2019 @ 8:39Sep 2, 2019 @ 16:58 Diane Shalem 3065 Views
   Abdel-Fatteh El-Sisis, Donald Trump, Hamas, Israel Air Force,
   Israel-Hizballah

   Israel categorically rejected Hizballah’s proposal of a “limited
   reprisal” to close the books on the IDF’s weekend attacks in Beirut and
   East Lebanon. The offer, as a formula for averting a general flareup of
   hostilities, was made during an exchange of back-channel messages on
   Tuesday, Aug. 27. However, as DEBKAfile’s military and intelligence
   sources reveal here, it was flatly rejected by Israel who replied
   unequivocally that any Hizballah attack on a military or civilian
   target -“limited” or not – would elicit a crushing Israeli blow against
   its forces in Lebanon.  For added muscle, the Israeli Air Force has
   been maintaining a round-the-clock presence over Lebanon, ready to
   strike Hizballah for any aggression without delay.

   The leaders of Iran’s Lebanese surrogate must therefore take into
   account that even a single rocket fired against Israel would bring
   forth a deadly Israeli counterblow and they have no way of predicting
   where that blow will fall.
   It is worth noting that not a single shot has been fired against the
   IAF aircraft over Lebanon, despite Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s
   threat on Sunday to shoot down every Israeli aerial intruder.

   According to intelligence estimates, Hizballah will try hard to stage
   an attack in the coming three weeks to take advantage of the
   pre-election climate prevailing in Israel in the run-up to its Sept. 17
   general election.

   In line with the US-Israel alliance, President Donald Trump called on
   Egyptian President Abdel-Fatteh El-Sisi, when they met at the weekend
   G-7 summit in Biarritz, to do what he can to rein in the Palestinian
   Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip and keep them from joining
   the violent campaign Iran and Hizballah are waging against Israel.
   El-Sisi responded by inviting a Hamas delegation to Cairo on Tuesday,
   Aug. 27 to warn them that Egyptian-Gaza links would be instantly
   severed if Hamas or Jihad struck Israel again.

   DEBKAfile stands firmly by its report that the real object of Israel’s
   drone attack in Beirut’s Dahya district last Saturday was the targeted
   assassination of a senior Iran-appointed liaison officer – not a
   missile factory, as falsely reported by The London Times and presented
   as fact by domestic media.

       What a surprise, Bibi has the psychopathic
       expectation that he should be able to kill and maim anyone other
       people under the guise of them possibly been a threat without any
       ability for them to retaliate.
       How very hypocritical and altogether typical of every thing that
       Israel has become. No equality before the law, right to steal and
       destroy without any fear. After all saying anything about this
       beacon of morality is antisemitic lol

                 Well in today’s world not believing the authority
                 narrative and learning to think for yourself is
                 considered a mental illness lol
                 But I really hope that I’m wrong in seeing almost
                 everything that Israel says at the moment as just reverse
                 projection.

            How people can still defend this behavior is beyond belief.
            Almost every thing that Israel says is the opposite of fact.
            Narrative control and reverse projection.
            A democracy where people are treated differently before the
            law. Evil is ok because its beneficial for us and we are
            special people who are always just the victims….
            But when you have psychopaths leading the country and running
            for office office again is it really any surprise that this is
            occurring?

                      The fact is Israel has agreement with Lebanon after
                      the Israel evacuated half the country from the North
                      to Negev in the last war and lost over 2500 soldiers
                      dead and wounded . No , Bibi want to get his own
                      country demolished by thousands of rockets . And
                      what he will do destroy Lebanon or Israel if they
                      all start shooting rockets from all the directions ?
                      Iraq, Yemen, Gasa, Sinai , Lebanon , Syria and
                      Turkomans . Yes he will be very precise in
                      destroying Israel with his f-22`s .

                 tom, sounds like a perfect description of the practical
                 tenets of Islam. The Yahwistic sects of christians and
                 jews at least had starts in truth and integrity. Islam
                 had it’s start in pillage, murder, and idolatry. If
                 Israel’s neighbors would cease making existential
                 threats, perhaps Israel would stop making nasty defenses.

                 or the 1930’s in Germany, but what do I know.

            throughout history has said as well. Then again if you where a

       Hizballah has long calibrated its responses but to actually fairly
       openly offer to limit its reprisals to me suggests Iran is very
       concerned that they are not able to execute and sustain a bigger
       reprisal.
       It also comes at a time when Iran is making more noise about
       negotiating with the USA (might not sound like it to some but
       that’s what they’re doing). The sanctions have to be hurting
       Iran/Hizballah finances pretty badly and that may be affecting
       military/terrorist readiness.
       The Chinese noises about negotiating with the USA are likely at
       least loosely linked to all of this as well. The linkage won’t be
       tight, however.

            iran needs a regime change, but it has to come totally from
            within. The last external change was operation ajax in 1953,
            which is the source of all the friction from then to now with
            iran.

       1. For Hezbollah there is this warning “You move, you die!”. I
       think they will try to harm Israel. If it happens, things will
       escalate and the reconstruction of Lebanon might take decades.
       2. While in an war at North, any attack of Hamas will be answered
       with destructive force. I think they will try to harm Israel in
       concert with Hezbollah. In this case, the reconstruction of Gaza
       might take decades.
       3. A minor point – there is a Tommy situation following his BDS
       hypnosis attack. He is first wrong, then over-wrong, because not
       paying attention to arguments. But there is no obligation to
       address him at all.

       Not much to do, but hoping Hezz will attack and then the cards are
       free for Bibi.
       I think Bibi did good job in showing restraint/ patience and warned
       them more than once.
       Soon will be the right time to start carpetbombing Beirut and
       repeat the same ‘last warning’ to the likes of Iran/syria and Gaza.
       the time of talking is over please: ONe last warning before hitting
       them like they have never seen before.
       time to show IDF is still in great shape and painfull decisions
       will be made.
       show no remorse please..not like 2006..Keep on bombing Dresden
       alike..only words Arabs understand.
       20 years ago I was strongly opposed to Israel, and wished them bad
       luck.
       Today, after paying attention and get properly informed, I really
       wish the Arabs a good lesson once and for all.

       First, it was the Arab Nations that Misled the Palestinians to
       Abandon & Attack the UN Creation of Israel & Palestine State &
       Expelled Jewish Populations in their Nations that Returned to
       Israel. 2nd, those Nations chose 3 Wars & Palestinians Rejected 12
       Peace Offers. 3rd, Some Arab Nations Chose Israel Recognition to
       Exists & Abandon Exiling Palestinians that Attacked them. 4th, then
       the Shiia took over Iran in 1979 Attacking Suinnis, Christians, and
       Jewish and Funding Terror throughout the Mideast. 5th Terror groups
       then continued to Attack their own Nations, The West, & have Reaped
       those Wayward War Winds Today

       The Demographic Populations of Iran has changed whereby the Youth
       was not Born until after the Iran-Iraq War & won’t fight for the
       Shiia Regime like in the 1980s. Afghanistan has over 50% their
       Youth under 20 & Don’t Remember Won’t allow the Taliban Terror to
       Return even if America pulls out due 911. Both Nations Terror
       Regimes have been Changed & Hizballah will face the same Fate of Al
       Aqada, Taliaban, Brotherhood, ISIS, & Shiia Terror! True Power
       Wears Out & Thins Those That Don’t Have It!

       Many Lebanese will welcome Attacks on Hizballah & Work to Betray
       Removal Them from Lebanon & Syria as well. They will end up in
       Camps like ISIS & Exiled in Iran. Proxies Servants Serve they do
       not Rule! Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon Yemen are Places of
       Devastation from Deviate Leadership that comes back on them! It
       won’t be Pretty & Hurts Neighbors as well, but it will end
       Hizballah in the end!

       The point that Tommy has been making is clearly understood and
       relatively accurate even if prefer to ignore it.
       As as always Haaretz is timely as ever.
       https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-if-there-s-such-a-thing-as
       -a-murderous-culture-then-it-exists-in-israel-1.7765199
       But i have to agree with that there is a time and a place for such
       discussions our sociable evils and maybe he should consider writing
       a few articles for Haaretz. The purpose of this site is not to
       focus on our inner demons so Tommy please leave these poor people
       alone to wallow in their own world view while you focus on more
       productive releases for your energy.

       The Simple Truthful Reality is that Iran & Proxies Hamas,
       Hizballah, Houthis do Fear Israel and it shows how they have No
       Choice but to Accept the Deaths of Proxies Surrogate of their Own
       Operations Weapons Facilities. The Reality is few want to Employ or
       Deployed knowing the termination Policy is Life trying to Plan
       Death towards others?

       America & Israel both have Abilities to Shoot Down any Drones with
       Laser Precision making them Obsolete! Iran Leadership is Impotent,
       Hizballah’s Cowards Remian Living in Man Made Caves, Hamas &
       Palestinians Give Speeches & Houthis Die Every Day by Arabian
       Hands.

       Israel’s Bibi, has Brilliantly Turned an Uncontrollable Escalation
       to his Advantage. People Unite as a Crisis Exploit the situation to
       its utmost, by dragging the Nation to a Low Level Conflict!

       The Question Essence Of Tragedy Isn’t The Conflict Of Right &
       Wrong, It Is The Conflict Of Right & Right Becomes Conflict Between
       Wrong & Wrong, For Every Death, There’s Always A Death To Be
       Avenged? The True Answer Justice For The Many, Justice For The Free
       By Way Of A Fee, Let Each Man Be Paid In Full, For Ourselves Alone!
