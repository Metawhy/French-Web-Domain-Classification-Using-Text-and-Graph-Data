   Instagram post 2140918082540751035_5311597 While I absolutely despise
   folding laundry from the dryer, I really do love referring to
   @unstoppables as "laundry sprinkles" when I let Gwen help me, haha!⁣ ⁣
   I know I’ve said it before, but if you aren’t stocking up on
   cleaning/laundry supplies like Downy, Tide and Bounce at @biglots then
   you are missing out!⁣ ⁣ Also, if you happen to have any tips on dealing
   with a toddler that starts screaming because we aren't allowed to put
   inflated balloons into the dryer, then I'm all ears...⁣ ⁣
