FOCUS ON WOMEN'S SAFETY

Sally Napper

   More businesses are sending female travellers around the world yet we
   know that more than 80% of female travellers are very nervous about
   what they may face when travelling. It is imperative to provide access
   to destination-specific advise based on their risk profile and
   offer 24/7 assistance should anything go wrong while travelling.

       Research and experience shows that business travellers face a
       growing threat from cyber criminal activity, from well-organised
       networks as well as uncoordinated attacks. As a result, business
       travellers face increased cyber-targeting and exposure during
       business travels as global digitalisation continues to advance, and
       reliance on technology becomes almost unavoidable.

    Dr Mark Parrish
    Medical Director - Europe
       This is not short term – it takes a number of years to put these
       programmes in place, to measure them and to show benefits. Many
       employers recognise that they need to work in tandem with their
       public healthcare systems. That will bring the most benefit to them
       and their employees.

Language Barriers and Fears

Overview

   The patient had symptoms of cardiac problems on a holiday cruise, the
   decision was made to disembark & admit him to a private specialist
   unit.

   Service: Medical evacuation

   Location: Marseilles, France

Problem

   A 56 year old British gentleman was on a Mediterranean holiday cruise
   with his wife when he started feeling unwell. Because the ship’s doctor
   became concerned that the patient’s symptoms were related to a cardiac
   problem, the patient and his wife were disembarked at the next port, a
   Corsican town called Ajaccio. He was admitted to the local public
   hospital and then moved by air ambulance to a private specialist unit
   in Marseilles on the mainland.

   Operating theatre

Solution

     * International SOS arranged a commercial flight and accommodation
       for the patient’s wife to meet and support her husband in
       Marseilles
     * The patient required heart bypass surgery. International SOS
       medical team and the treating doctor, to undergo surgery in France.
       The patient gave his consent to have the operation locally.
     * We kept in daily contact with the patient to monitor his recovery,
       progress and to offer support. The patient was frustrated by
       language difficulties but comforted by daily contact with a medical
       professional in English about his concerns.
     * Besides, the patient suffered from a chronic fear of flying, and
       was getting increasingly agitated about his forthcoming travel. The
       possibility to undertake the journey by train or road was reviewed
       in detail.
     * The arrangements were made at short notice, one day before the
       opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
     * The patient, his wife and the medical escort finally travelled to
       the UK on 26 July, by train to Paris, Eurostar to London and ground
       transport to Gloucestershire to avoid road traffic complications.
     * The patient underwent a post transport review at his nearest
       hospital in the UK as a precautionary measure, and was declared fit
       to be released home on the same day.

Impact

   The patient wrote to us to say: "You guys were nothing short of
   fantastic and totally professional in everything you did and your
   assistance made what would have been a complete nightmare into
   something that was bearable throughout."

   This case is an example of the difference human contact can make during
   the process of daily medical monitoring while the patient is admitted
   to hospital. Equally important was that neither the patient nor his
   wife had to unnecessarily chase us for updates on medical expenses or
   travel arrangements.

   Despite the logistical challenges on the journey to the UK, the patient
   and his wife always felt supported.

Improving a Healthcare Administration Programme

Overview

   Running a healthcare plan for thousands of employees requires competent
   administration, excellence in case management, and a solid network of
   doctors, hospitals and health providers. When your company does not
   have an adequate medical programme in place, costs can escalate along
   with increased employee sick time and lowered productivity. The case
   study below illustrates how International SOS centralised oversight,
   management and reporting for a client’s healthcare management program
   bringing considerable efficiencies.

   Service: Healthcare administration services

   Location: Jakarta, Indonesia

Problem

   Pierre Thibaut, HR Manager of a multinational mining corporation in
   Indonesia, inherited a healthcare programme from his predecessor and
   saw the need for improvement.  The existing programme was uncoordinated
   and fragmented. Employees complained about having to wait too long to
   see a doctor and were unhappy with the quality of the medical care they
   received. The catalogue of problems included wrong diagnoses,
   inadequately trained doctors, poor hospital sanitation, long hospital
   stays, lack of equipment, incorrect prescriptions and spiralling costs.
   Pierre knew that changing the company's healthcare programme would be a
   major challenge.

   Clinic employee

Solution

   Pierre contacted International SOS to help him deliver quality medical
   care while keeping a lid on costs. We conducted a full audit of the
   company's current health cover and made recommendations which were
   accepted. Firstly, International SOS centrally managed the healthcare
   programme from Jakarta with a small team of a doctor, nurses and
   several administrators. Employees could contact this team via a
   dedicated phone line and get medical advice as well as referrals to our
   accredited network of primary care physicians, specialists, dentists,
   and hospitals. With this came total confidence that all the
   practitioners and facilities had been screened to ensure they met
   international standards of care.

   Many of these providers also offered cashless access to medical care
   for employees, so employees didn't have to pay for doctor's visits
   upfront. At the company's other sites in Indonesia, we implemented
   local solutions to improve access to healthcare. In Papua at a busy
   mine, we assigned a doctor and administrator to coordinate care and
   keep the on-site workforce healthy.

   International SOS conducted reviews of diagnosis and treatment and
   verified the amounts patients were billed. Pierre received monthly
   reports on what had been spent, on what and where, so that he could
   gain visibility on key health issues and identify preventive health and
   wellness programs for employees.

Impact

   The survey results Pierre commissioned after eight months showed a
   staggering improvement - employee hospital stays were reduced by 45%,
   savings on the healthcare budget of $130,000 USD were realised.
   Employee satisfaction increased. This was notably linked to the fact
   that employees had a much better level of healthcare with more accurate
   diagnosis, treatment and preventive care.

Assistance With a Lost Passport and Missing Wallet

Overview

   If you are unlucky enough to lose your passport while you are abroad,
   it can be time-consuming and stressful to get a replacement. We
   strongly advise members to travel with copies of their passports and
   visas in case the originals are lost as it helps expedite consulate
   services.

   While International SOS can not promise next day service to replace
   government documents, we can often make things easier - by scheduling
   appointments with embassies, arranging translation, wiring emergency
   funds, and rebooking flights home.

   Service: International SOS membership

   Location: Moscow, Russia

Problem

   As an international banker, Anne Davidson* travelled frequently. While
   in Moscow on a three-day business trip, her money and passport were
   stolen. Due to fly home to London the following day, Anne was
   understandably in a panic. She called our International SOS assistance
   centre in Moscow for help.

Assistance Centre

Solution

   Within 20 seconds, the assistance centre answered her call and began to
   assist her.  Before her trip, we advised Anne at her pre-travel
   briefing to photocopy her passport and Russian visa. Unfortunately, in
   her haste she forgot to bring these items. No matter, International SOS
   contacted Anne’s company and they faxed a copy of her passport from her
   employee files. Additionally, they authorized us to wire Anne 12,000
   roubles ($400 USD) in emergency funds.

   International SOS supplied translation services so she could file a
   police report for her stolen wallet. We also arranged an appointment
   for Anne at the British Embassy.

   The next morning, she went to the embassy and got a replacement
   passport within 24 hours. At the same time, Anne’s in-country visa
   sponsor helped her apply for a new Russian visa so she could return to
   the UK. With the help the assistance centre, her flight home was
   rebooked. Three days later, Anne received her visa and was on her way
   home.

Impact

   With International SOS’ expert assistance, advice, logistical support,
   and translation services, what could have taken weeks to get back to
   London, took only days. Anne was pleased that she worked for an
   employer who provided access to essential travel support for her in an
   emergency.

A Fall in Paradise: Air Evacuation from St. Kitts

Overview

   The island of St. Kitts, in the eastern Caribbean, attracts tourists
   from around the world for its beautiful beaches, rain forest and
   mountains. But for an American couple on honeymoon, a hike into a
   dormant volcano took an unexpected turn and International SOS was there
   to help.
   Service: International SOS membership
   Location: St. Kitts, Caribbean

Problem

   On one of the last days of their trip, newlyweds Clay and Acaimie set
   out to hike the inactive volcano in the centre of the island, a popular
   destination on St. Kitts. The trek is steep, rocky and slippery in the
   lush jungle terrain. After more than a two-hour climb to the top of
   Mount Liamuiga, Clay decided to take a rope trail down into the crater
   while Acaimie remained above.


   “We had already reached the top and since it was a dormant volcano the
   crater of it was a lush prairie,” Clay wrote on social media. “I
   trusted the ropes with my weight too much and one of them snapped.”


   He fell more than 50 feet down the hillside, suffering a fractured
   skull, loss of hearing in his right ear, and a severe concussion. An
   initial diagnosis of a cracked vertebrae turned out to be false; it was
   an air bubble that was picked up on the scan.

   “I started getting this feeling, this really bad feeling, that
   something really bad had happened,” Acaimie said at a hospital news
   conference after their return. “I started to call down the mountain and
   I asked ‘Hey Clay are you okay, is everything alright?’ I didn’t hear a
   response at first and then I just listened really, really closely and I
   heard what sounded like Clay saying ‘Help!’


   It took time for his wife to reach him, pull him to safety and find a
   phone signal to call for help. The climb out took several hours, and he
   was met by paramedics and taken to a local hospital.

   “Acaimie is extremely strong and managed to help me back up out of the
   volcano crater and down the trail up its side until we got signal which
   was about two miles while I was collapsing and vomiting blood the
   entire way,” he wrote.



Solution

   Immediately after initial contact with paramedics, the International
   SOS Assistance Centre in Philadelphia was alerted to help with medical
   transportation services and determined the fastest and most cost
   effective means of evacuation.


   Clay’s injuries meant that he could not travel on a commercial carrier
   and needed an aircraft that would fly a lower altitude. In partnership
   with REVA, North America’s largest fixed-wing jet air-ambulance
   service, International SOS was able to facilitate air ambulance
   transportation back to the United States.

   “At International SOS we have one common goal, to protect travellers,”
   said Dr Robert L. Quigley, Senior Vice President and Regional Medical
   Director of International SOS. “We’re extremely happy to hear that the
   patient is doing well and was discharged.


   I am proud of my team of global specialists who did a flawless job of
   executing immediate air transportation assistance.”

Impact

   The trip went smoothly, and Clay recovered at a hospital in Florida
   before returning home to Indiana. It’s a successful outcome that
   International SOS was pleased to have been a part of.
