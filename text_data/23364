   Is your browser safe against tracking?
   [triangle.png]

   When you visit a website, online trackers and the site itself may be
   able to identify you – even if you’ve installed software to protect
   yourself. It’s possible to configure your browser to thwart tracking,
   but many people don’t know how.

   Panopticlick will analyze how well your browser and add-ons protect you
   against online tracking techniques. We’ll also see if your system is
   uniquely configured—and thus identifiable—even if you are using
   privacy-protective software. However, we only do so with your explicit
   consent, through the TEST ME button below.
   Test me [X] Test with a real tracking company ^what's this?

   Only anonymous data will be collected through this site.

   Panopticlick is a research project of the Electronic Frontier
   Foundation. EFF operates Panopticlick in the United States, which may
   not provide as much privacy protection as your home country.
   Panopticlick is part of an effort to illustrate the problem with
   tracking techniques, and help get stronger privacy protections for
   everyone. Learn more.
