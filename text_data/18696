The Lion Roars Againâ€¦

   Nestled in the heart of the Staffordshire countryside, a short distance
   from the bustling town of Stafford, is the village of Bradley.
   Neighbour to the historical Church of All Saints and St Marys, The Red
   Lion awaits you.

   Since being taken over by The Lewis Partnership in November 2015, the
   Red Lion has gone from strength to strength and we are proud to have
   once again established this countryside gem into the heart of the
   village community.

   Our extensive refurbishment is now complete.  The Red Lion has now been
   brought up to The Lewis Partnership standards and sits proudly within
   our portfolio .
