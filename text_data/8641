Connecting data to discover insights That drive business outcomes

   We believe that Marketing Intelligence is not only about understanding
   who our consumers are, but what drives their decisions. Online
   browsing, offline location and purchases, multi-channel touchpoints -
   even the cultural and economic trends around us - all offer their own
   unique part of the answer.

   It is through the access to this diverse and comprehensive perspective
   on user behavior, along with the data science and human ingenuity
   required to distill this, that MiQ provides Marketing Intelligence
   which decodes the consumer and drive meaningful business outcomes.
