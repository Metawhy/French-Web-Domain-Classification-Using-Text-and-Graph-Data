A few benefits

Sweet Nothings

   Some client love.

“We’re using Toggl to analyze the profitability of the projects we do for our
clients, and for tracking our internal ROI. But sometimes we also show the
data to our clients - that makes negotiations a lot easier!”

“Using Toggl is helping us get a handle on our time allocation for different
customers and projects. Before we had no idea of what people were spending
their work time on - I had to check in on that all the time. Now I can just
focus on the important things, instead of micromanaging.”

“It’s always hard to predict how much time a project is going to take. Having
stats on how much time different things have taken in the past is great for
getting accurate predictions for the future.”
