NEW 'Little Man' party printables - happy customer photos

   We recently celebrated my youngest son Max's 3rd birthday.
   So of course.....I designed a new set of printables for the occasion
   :-)
   'Mister Max' is a nickname we have for Max, so I decided to do a little
   man themed party!
   The photos of the party will be coming soon, but for now, I have some
   others from one of my customers to share with you. The lovely Katie of
   Charming Treats emailed me a while ago
   to ask if I had a little man theme, lucky for her I was in the process
   of designing them for Max's party.
   I chose to do the design in two colour ways, as I adore vintage colour
   palettes but also love simple, modern designs using colours that pop.
   Katie chose the vintage colours for her son Lucas' party
   and has kindly shared some fantastic photos with us (thank you!) so
   enjoy and be inspired....
   Cake, cupcakes, cookie and cake pops all made by Charming Treats

   Katie made edible cupcake toppers using our printable party spot design

   [404173_451100041608317_774093657_n.jpg]
    These mini chocolates were cleverly wrapped using our party spot
   printable (rather than punching them with a circle punch Katie left
   them as squares to wrap around)

    Awesome cake by Charming Treats !!

FREE Breast Cancer Awareness printables

   [BCApreview.png]
   'Every day in Australia around 48 women are diagnosed with
   gynaecological or breast cancer' :-(
   Unfortunately these cancers touch everyone's life in one form or
   another,
   even the smallest donation will help in some way.
   I thought I'd create some pretty printables that might inspire you to
   hold a girls' night in to help raise funds for Women's cancers. Girls'
   night in doesnt have to be a night event, you could hold a breakfast,
   morning tea, lunch or afternoon tea
   Download your free printables here
   The file contains and invitation template, thank you note card, party
   spots / tags, and buffet labels
