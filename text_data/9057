The Koreas at Night

   The Koreas at Night

   January 30, 2014JPEG

   Flying over East Asia, astronauts on the International Space Station
   (ISS) took this night image of the Korean Peninsula. Unlike daylight
   images, city lights at night illustrate dramatically the relative
   economic importance of cities, as gauged by relative size. In this
   north-looking view, it is immediately obvious that greater Seoul is a
   major city and that the port of Gunsan is minor by comparison. There
   are 25.6 million people in the Seoul metropolitan area—more than half
   of South Korea’s citizens—while Gunsan’s population is 280,000.

   North Korea is almost completely dark compared to neighboring South
   Korea and China. The darkened land appears as if it were a patch of
   water joining the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan. Its capital city,
   Pyongyang, appears like a small island, despite a population of 3.26
   million (as of 2008). The light emission from Pyongyang is equivalent
   to the smaller towns in South Korea.

   Coastlines are often very apparent in night imagery, as shown by South
   Korea’s eastern shoreline. But the coast of North Korea is difficult to
   detect. These differences are illustrated in per capita power
   consumption in the two countries, with South Korea at 10,162 kilowatt
   hours and North Korea at 739 kilowatt hours.

   Astronaut photograph ISS038-E-38300 was acquired on January 30, 2014,
   with a Nikon D3S digital camera using a 24 millimeter lens, and is
   provided by the ISS Crew Earth Observations Facility and the Earth
   Science and Remote Sensing Unit, Johnson Space Center. The image was
   taken by the Expedition 38 crew. It has been cropped and enhanced to
   improve contrast, and lens artifacts have been removed. The
   International Space Station Program supports the laboratory as part of
   the ISS National Lab to help astronauts take pictures of Earth that
   will be of the greatest value to scientists and the public, and to make
   those images freely available on the Internet. Additional images taken
   by astronauts and cosmonauts can be viewed at the NASA/JSC Gateway to
   Astronaut Photography of Earth. Caption by M. Justin Wilkinson, Jacobs

A Raft of Rock

   A Raft of Rock

   August 13, 2019

   Volcanoes have a lot of dramatic ways to announce their presence: thick
   plumes of ash and steam; rivers and lakes of molten lava; rockfalls and
   lahars; earthquakes; even the sudden rising of an island above the
   water line. One of the more subtle and rarely observed displays is the
   pumice raft.

   Many of the world’s volcanoes are shrouded by the waters of the oceans.
   When they erupt, they can discolor the ocean surface with gases and
   debris. They also can spew masses of lava that are lighter than water.
   Such pumice rocks are full of holes and cavities, and they easily
   float.

   August 13, 2019JPEG

   On August 13, 2019, the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 acquired
   natural-color imagery of a vast pumice raft floating in the tropical
   Pacific Ocean near Late Island in the Kingdom of Tonga. NASA’s Terra
   satellite detected the mass of floating rock on August 9; the
   discolored water around the pumice suggests that the submarine volcano
   lies somewhere below. By August 13, the raft had drifted southwest. As
   of August 22, the raft had moved north again and was a bit more
   dispersed, but still visible.

   The Volcano Discovery web site reported that it received an email from
   a sailor on August 7, 2019, about clouds of smoke on the horizon in the
   direction of Fonualei volcano. According to a bulletin from the
   Smithsonian’s Global Volcanism Program (GVP), sailors began reporting
   sightings of the pumice raft by August 9. The crew of the catamaran
   Roam encountered the pumice and provided a detailed report on Facebook
   on August 15. The sailors described a “rubble slick made up of rocks
   from marble to basketball size such that water was not visible,” as
   well as a smell of sulfur.

   Volcanologists at the Smithsonian believe the evidence points to an
   unnamed submarine volcano near Tonga at 18.325° South, 174.365° West.
   The last report of an eruption at the site occurred in 2001, and the
   summit of the seamount is believed to stand about 40 meters (130 feet)
   below the water line.

   Volcanologist Erik Klemetti of Denison University wrote: “Pumice rafts
   can drift for weeks to years, slowly dispersing into the ocean
   currents. These chunks of pumice end up making excellent, drifting
   homes for sea organisms, helping them spread...The erupted pumice means
   this volcano erupts magma high in silica like rhyolite.”

Fires in Brazil

   Fires in Brazil

   August 13, 2019JPEG

   Editor’s Note: This story was updated on 22 August 2019 to clarify our
   data source.

   In the Amazon rainforest, fire season has arrived. The Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite
   captured these images of several fires burning in the states of
   Rondônia, Amazonas, Pará, and Mato Grosso on August 11 and August 13,
   2019.

   In the Amazon region, fires are rare for much of the year because wet
   weather prevents them from starting and spreading. However, in July and
   August, activity typically increases due to the arrival of the dry
   season. Many people use fire to maintain farmland and pastures or to
   clear land for other purposes. Typically, activity peaks in early
   September and mostly stops by November.

   As of August 16, 2019, an analysis of NASA satellite data indicated
   that total fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been
   close to the average in comparison to the past 15 years. (The Amazon
   spreads across Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and parts of other countries.)
   Though activity appears to be above average in the states of Amazonas
   and Rondônia, it has so far appeared below average in Mato Grosso and
   Pará, according to estimates from the Global Fire Emissions Database, a
   research project that compiles and analyzes NASA data. (Note that while
   the chart label says 2016, the 2019 data is listed on all of the plots
   as a green line. Roll your cursor over the green 2019 block below the
   plot to isolate the 2019 numbers.)
