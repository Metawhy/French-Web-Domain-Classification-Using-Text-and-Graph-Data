Shanghai

   As a thriving financial centre, Shanghai has become a popular
   destination for business travellers and leisure explorers. A unique
   combination of colonial buildings, modern skyscrapers and shopping
   centres help define the city’s mark on modern China. Travellers staying
   at Marriott hotels in Shanghai enjoy easy access to the city’s top
   historic attractions, the best shopping and restaurants.

   Shanghai is a culturally diverse city, and its French roots are proudly
   displayed in the Bund, an area located on the Huangpu River. Plan a
   shopping adventure or an evening stroll at the Bund, where the
   European-style buildings provide a picturesque, romantic backdrop. Our
   Shanghai luxury hotels are also conveniently located near the Jade
   Buddha Temple, where you can see the famous jade Buddha statues brought
   to China in 1882. The Shanghai Museum, arguably one of the best museums
   in the country, provides visitors a glimpse into China’s past. This
   massive museum features 11 galleries and over 120,000 artefacts.

   Looking for things to do in Shanghai with children? Regardless of age,
   your children will enjoy walking through the world’s longest underwater
   tunnel at the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium. If you’re staying at The
   Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong, walk across the street for outdoor
   entertainment. Lujiazui Central Green is perfect for an afternoon
   stroll, taking in the sculptures along the way.

   If you want to explore local nightlife, Shanghai will not disappoint.
   Travellers can bar hop, dance the night away at discos or enjoy the
   cool atmosphere of a jazz club before returning to their Shanghai
   hotel.

Shanghai

   As a thriving financial centre, Shanghai has become a popular
   destination for business travellers and leisure explorers. A unique
   combination of colonial buildings, modern skyscrapers and shopping
   centres help define the city’s mark on modern China. Travellers staying
   at Marriott hotels in Shanghai enjoy easy access to the city’s top
   historic attractions, the best shopping and restaurants.

   Shanghai is a culturally diverse city, and its French roots are proudly
   displayed in the Bund, an area located on the Huangpu River. Plan a
   shopping adventure or an evening stroll at the Bund, where the
   European-style buildings provide a picturesque, romantic backdrop. Our
   Shanghai luxury hotels are also conveniently located near the Jade
   Buddha Temple, where you can see the famous jade Buddha statues brought
   to China in 1882. The Shanghai Museum, arguably one of the best museums
   in the country, provides visitors a glimpse into China’s past. This
   massive museum features 11 galleries and over 120,000 artefacts.

   Looking for things to do in Shanghai with children? Regardless of age,
   your children will enjoy walking through the world’s longest underwater
   tunnel at the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium. If you’re staying at The
   Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong, walk across the street for outdoor
   entertainment. Lujiazui Central Green is perfect for an afternoon
   stroll, taking in the sculptures along the way.

   If you want to explore local nightlife, Shanghai will not disappoint.
   Travellers can bar hop, dance the night away at discos or enjoy the
   cool atmosphere of a jazz club before returning to their Shanghai
   hotel.

   As a thriving financial centre, Shanghai has become a popular
   destination for business travellers and leisure explorers. A unique
   combination of colonial buildings, modern skyscrapers and shopping
   centres help define the city’s mark on modern China. Travellers staying
   at Marriott hotels in Shanghai enjoy easy access to the city’s top
   historic attractions, the best shopping and restaurants.

   Shanghai is a culturally diverse city, and its French roots are proudly
   displayed in the Bund, an area located on the Huangpu River. Plan a
   shopping adventure or an evening stroll at the Bund, where the
   European-style buildings provide a picturesque, romantic backdrop. Our
   Shanghai luxury hotels are also conveniently located near the Jade
   Buddha Temple, where you can see the famous jade Buddha statues brought
   to China in 1882. The Shanghai Museum, arguably one of the best museums
   in the country, provides visitors a glimpse into China’s past. This
   massive museum features 11 galleries and over 120,000 artefacts.

   Looking for things to do in Shanghai with children? Regardless of age,
   your children will enjoy walking through the world’s longest underwater
   tunnel at the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium. If you’re staying at The
   Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong, walk across the street for outdoor
   entertainment. Lujiazui Central Green is perfect for an afternoon
   stroll, taking in the sculptures along the way.

   If you want to explore local nightlife, Shanghai will not disappoint.
   Travellers can bar hop, dance the night away at discos or enjoy the
   cool atmosphere of a jazz club before returning to their Shanghai
   hotel.

Shanghai

   As a thriving financial centre, Shanghai has become a popular
   destination for business travellers and leisure explorers. A unique
   combination of colonial buildings, modern skyscrapers and shopping
   centres help define the city’s mark on modern China. Travellers staying
   at Marriott hotels in Shanghai enjoy easy access to the city’s top
   historic attractions, the best shopping and restaurants.

   Shanghai is a culturally diverse city, and its French roots are proudly
   displayed in the Bund, an area located on the Huangpu River. Plan a
   shopping adventure or an evening stroll at the Bund, where the
   European-style buildings provide a picturesque, romantic backdrop. Our
   Shanghai luxury hotels are also conveniently located near the Jade
   Buddha Temple, where you can see the famous jade Buddha statues brought
   to China in 1882. The Shanghai Museum, arguably one of the best museums
   in the country, provides visitors a glimpse into China’s past. This
   massive museum features 11 galleries and over 120,000 artefacts.

   Looking for things to do in Shanghai with children? Regardless of age,
   your children will enjoy walking through the world’s longest underwater
   tunnel at the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium. If you’re staying at The
   Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong, walk across the street for outdoor
   entertainment. Lujiazui Central Green is perfect for an afternoon
   stroll, taking in the sculptures along the way.

   If you want to explore local nightlife, Shanghai will not disappoint.
   Travellers can bar hop, dance the night away at discos or enjoy the
   cool atmosphere of a jazz club before returning to their Shanghai
   hotel.

Shanghai

   As a thriving financial centre, Shanghai has become a popular
   destination for business travellers and leisure explorers. A unique
   combination of colonial buildings, modern skyscrapers and shopping
   centres help define the city’s mark on modern China. Travellers staying
   at Marriott hotels in Shanghai enjoy easy access to the city’s top
   historic attractions, the best shopping and restaurants.

   Shanghai is a culturally diverse city, and its French roots are proudly
   displayed in the Bund, an area located on the Huangpu River. Plan a
   shopping adventure or an evening stroll at the Bund, where the
   European-style buildings provide a picturesque, romantic backdrop. Our
   Shanghai luxury hotels are also conveniently located near the Jade
   Buddha Temple, where you can see the famous jade Buddha statues brought
   to China in 1882. The Shanghai Museum, arguably one of the best museums
   in the country, provides visitors a glimpse into China’s past. This
   massive museum features 11 galleries and over 120,000 artefacts.

   Looking for things to do in Shanghai with children? Regardless of age,
   your children will enjoy walking through the world’s longest underwater
   tunnel at the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium. If you’re staying at The
   Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong, walk across the street for outdoor
   entertainment. Lujiazui Central Green is perfect for an afternoon
   stroll, taking in the sculptures along the way.

   If you want to explore local nightlife, Shanghai will not disappoint.
   Travellers can bar hop, dance the night away at discos or enjoy the
   cool atmosphere of a jazz club before returning to their Shanghai
   hotel.
