   TEL AVIV, Israel, May 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --

   SQream, developer of SQream DB, the leading GPU database for analyzing
   massive data stores at a fraction of the cost, announced today that it
   has raised $26.4 million in Series B funding. The latest round was led
   by Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) with participation from existing and new
   investors including Hanaco Venture Capital, Sistema.vc, World Trade
   Ventures, Paradiso Ventures, Glory Ventures, and Silvertech Ventures.

   SQream DB, a powerful SQL analytical database, enables companies to
   analyze up to 20 times more data, up to 100 times faster, at as little
   as 10% of the cost and administration. SQream DB harnesses the power of
   thousands of parallel processing cores in NVIDIA GPUs. The solution
   allows users to easily ingest, store and analyze tens to hundreds of
   terabytes of data and more with significantly reduced infrastructure
   and manpower resources. The result is unparalleled power and
   flexibility to explore and analyze massive amounts of data. The latest
   investment reinforces the rising challenge facing enterprises to take
   full advantage of rapidly growing data stores.

   "SQream is uniquely positioned to provide enterprises with the solution
   they require to lower the barrier for accessing and analyzing rapidly
   growing, large-scale data stores in the cloud. We are pleased to expand
   our relationship with SQream, and work together to accelerate the
   growth of the cloud industry," said Chaoqun Zhan, Director of Alibaba
   Database Business.

   This strategic investment deepens the relationship between Alibaba
   Cloud and SQream. In February, the companies announced a collaboration
   agreement to provide Alibaba Cloud's customers with a cost effective
   way to set up, access and analyze data in the cloud, enabling more
   comprehensive analytics and previously unobtainable business
   intelligence.

   "We are very gratified with the vote of confidence we have received
   from this round's lead investor, Alibaba Group, and our other key
   investors," said Ami Gal, CEO and Co-founder of SQream. "The financing
   enables us to accelerate technological integration with ecosystem
   partners, and to grow our global sales and marketing team as we help
   enterprises worldwide meet the challenges of accessing and analyzing
   data from exponentially growing massive data stores."

   LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyperloop One today took
   another major step on its path to defining the future of
   transportation. The Company and the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority
   (RTA) agreed jointly to evaluate a Hyperloop One system in greater
   Dubai and the UAE. Hyperloop One will work with McKinsey & Co. and the
   Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) on a detailed feasibility study sponsored by
   the RTA. The agreement moves the company into its next stage of
   progress in Dubai following a successful engagement in the Dubai Future
   Accelerators, which culminated in a presentation of Hyperloop One's
   value proposition to His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al
   Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of
   Dubai.

   Additionally, Hyperloop One unveiled an original concept for autonomous
   transportation in the UAE, including designs for the world's first
   Hyperloop One Portals (the equivalent of a station or airport) and
   Hyperloop One Pods that can take passengers from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in
   12 minutes, compared to a two-hour drive. The work is the result of
   deep collaboration between Hyperloop One and BIG's amazing team of
   architects and engineers. Both announcements were revealed at the Burj
   Khalifa in Dubai.

   "Technology is evolving and transforming how we live, yet we lack real
   innovation in mass transportation and the current system has stagnated.
   Hyperloop One is focused on transport that's far more efficient, fast
   and clean. It will change the dynamics of how we move goods and
   people," said Shervin Pishevar, Executive Chairman, Hyperloop One.
   "Dubai makes perfect sense for Hyperloop One because this is the 21st
   century's global transport hub and its leaders understand that
   Hyperloop One is ushering in the next era of transportation."

   Under the terms the agreement, Hyperloop One will work with McKinsey
   and BIG to evaluate the implementation of a passenger Hyperloop in
   Dubai. This announcement is the second partner agreement Hyperloop One
   has signed in Dubai and the sixth worldwide. The Company announced a
   deal in August to pursue a cargo Hyperloop One system with ports
   operator DP World at its deepwater Jebel Ali port in Dubai. The
   Company's growing presence on the ground in the UAE underscores the
   demand for Hyperloop One technology for passengers and freight in the
   country.

   Chairman of the RTA, His Excellency Mattar Al Tayer, commented on the
   agreement, saying, "This is an opportunity to help transform the UAE
   from a technology consumer to a technology creator, incubating
   expertise for a new global industry, in line with the UAE's Vision
   2021. With Hyperloop One, we will create a new means of transportation,
   keeping our region at the forefront of transportation technology and
   innovation."

   Conceptual Vision
   The engineers, architects and designers from Hyperloop One and BIG have
   collaborated intensively for six months to produce a comprehensive
   human experience for Hyperloop travel. The Company is showcasing today
   the first-ever routes from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, several Portal sites
   throughout Dubai and the conceptual interiors and exteriors of the
   individual passenger Pods. The work is based on a detailed study of how
   an urban and inter-city transport network should integrate with the
   existing infrastructure. It's autonomous, point-to-point and vastly
   simplifies the experience of getting from your front door to your
   destination.

   "We're going to create a seamless experience that starts the moment you
   think about being somewhere – not going somewhere," said Josh Giegel,
   President of Engineering, Hyperloop One. "We don't sell cars, boats,
   trains, or planes. We sell time. This puts an end to us being a
   'pod-in-a-tube' or 'fast train from SF to LA' company."

   "With Hyperloop One we have given form to a mobility ecosystem of pods
   and portals, where the waiting hall has vanished along with waiting
   itself," says Bjarke Ingels, founder, BIG. "Collective commuting with
   individual freedom at near supersonic speed. We are heading for a
   future where our mental map of the city is completely reconfigured, as
   our habitual understanding of distance and proximity – time and space –
   is warped by this virgin form of travel."

   In less than two years, Hyperloop One has raised more than $160
   million, assembled a team of more than 200 world-class experts, and
   built a campus in Downtown LA, a test and safety site in the Nevada
   desert, and a 100,000-sq. ft. machine and tooling shop in North Las
   Vegas. In addition, the Company has established a global partner
   network with industry leaders such as GE, SNCF, DP World, AECOM, Arup,
   Systra, Ramboll, and KPMG.

   "The momentum is global and accelerating," adds Hyperloop One CEO Rob
   Lloyd. "The world will see the test of the first full-scale Hyperloop
   system in early 2017 at our Test and Safety Site in Nevada and we will
   have multiple operational Hyperloop systems within five years."

   FAIRFAX, Va., Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American
   Council for Technology and Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) today
   announced that it has awarded Andrew Robinson, Chief Executive Officer
   of Robbins-Gioia LLC, the prestigious Janice K. Mendenhall Spirit of
   Leadership Award for his significant contributions to the federal
   information technology (IT) community. Robinson was among 8 individuals
   recognized for their leadership and commitment to public service at the
   ACT-IAC 2016 Executive Leadership Conference (ELC) in Colonial
   Williamsburg, Virginia.

   Established in 2001, the Janice K. Mendenhall Spirit of Leadership
   Award commemorates the life of long-time civil servant Janice
   Mendenhall, an exceptional leader who was known for her dedication to
   mentoring others and strengthening government and industry relations.
   The award is the highest tribute ACT-IAC bestows annually.

   ACT President Margie Graves and IAC Chair Dave McClure presented
   Robinson with the award in recognition of his long history of
   leadership in ACT-IAC and his contributions to a more effective and
   innovative government. Prior to joining Robbins-Gioia in 2016, Andy
   Robinson has over 25 years of experience in the technology arena with a
   strong record of success as a solutions-oriented strategic leader at
   ICF International, Exeter Group, Gartner Group and Xerox. Throughout
   his career he has demonstrated a strong commitment to improving
   government, mentoring people and strengthening the community. As a
   volunteer and leader within ACT-IAC, he has contributed to its mission
   of advancing government in many areas. Robinson is a past IAC Chair and
   played a key role in standing-up the ACT-IAC Institute for
   Innovation. He has just completed three years as the first Chair of the
   Institute. Robinson is a member of the George Washington University
   Research Advisory Board and Center for Cyber and Homeland Security
   Advisory Board. He is also a member of the Program Management Institute
   Global Executive Council. He is board member of Rendez-vous: Haiti – a
   non-profit organization established after the 2010 earthquake to help
   the people of Haiti improve their lives through sustainable
   development.  His accomplishments and standards are in the best
   tradition of the Mendenhall Award.

   Graves and McClure also presented two individuals with the ACT-IAC
   Leaders Award in recognition of the exceptional contributions they have
   made to ACT-IAC and advancing government. Richard Spires, CEO
   of LearningTree International, was recognized for his leadership in
   developing the FITARA Maturity Model now being used in federal
   government to improve the management of technology. U.S. Chief
   Information Officer Tony Scott was recognized for his exceptional
   leadership in creating a more effective and innovative government
   through the use of technology. He was also acknowledged for his support
   of strong government-industry collaboration.

   The ACT-IAC Individual Contributor of the Year Award – Government was
   presented to Dan Morgan (Department of Transportation). The ACT-IAC
   Individual Contributor of the Year Award – Industry was presented to
   Chip Block (Evolver).  Both individuals were recognized for their
   significant contributions to ACT-IAC over the past year.

   The ACT-IAC Rookie of the Year Award was presented to Matt Sexton
   (Tista Science and Technology) and Zach Buss (Booz Allen
   Hamilton). This award honors individuals who are relatively new to
   ACT-IAC and, in a short time, have already demonstrated active
   involvement across a range of activities in the organization.

   The Ginny McCormick New Heights Award recognizes an individual who has
   made significant contributions as a volunteer – working quietly and
   effectively towards a more effective government. The 2016 award was
   presented to Dee Delaney (AT&T).

   "Part of what makes ACT-IAC unique and valuable is the engagement and
   passion of so many exceptional volunteers from both government and
   industry. The individuals who have been recognized this year represent
   the best of the best," said ACT-IAC Executive Director Kenneth Allen.
   "Through their dedication, their investment of personal time and their
   commitment to the idea that collaboration produces better outcomes, we
   are all winners in our quest to create a more effective and innovative
   government."

   SAN FRANCISCO, July 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Twitter announced today it
   has created an online application process for Twitter accounts to
   receive verified status. Verified accounts on Twitter allow people to
   identify key individuals and organizations on Twitter as authentic, and
   are denoted by a blue badge icon. An account may be verified if it is
   determined to be of public interest. Typically this includes accounts
   maintained by public figures and organizations in music, TV, film,
   fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports,
   business, and other key interest areas.

   "We want to make it even easier for people to find creators and
   influencers on Twitter so it makes sense for us to let people apply for
   verification," said Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter's vice president of User
   Services. "We hope opening up this application process results in more
   people finding great, high-quality accounts to follow, and for these
   creators and influencers to connect with a broader audience."

   Twitter was the first platform to introduce account verification,
   starting in 2009 and currently has close to 187,000 verified accounts.
   The @CDCgov was one of the first Twitter accounts to be verified in
   order to help citizens find authentic and accurate public health
   information straight from the source. Among the other first accounts to
   be verified include @NASAArmstrong, @KimKardashian, @Oprah,
   @MilwaukeePolice, @SF311, and @TonyHawk.

   The application process will start rolling out today and be available
   globally this week. People can learn more about the application process
   in the Twitter Help Center.

   TEL AVIV, Israel, May 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --

   SQream, developer of SQream DB, the leading GPU database for analyzing
   massive data stores at a fraction of the cost, announced today that it
   has raised $26.4 million in Series B funding. The latest round was led
   by Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) with participation from existing and new
   investors including Hanaco Venture Capital, Sistema.vc, World Trade
   Ventures, Paradiso Ventures, Glory Ventures, and Silvertech Ventures.

   SQream DB, a powerful SQL analytical database, enables companies to
   analyze up to 20 times more data, up to 100 times faster, at as little
   as 10% of the cost and administration. SQream DB harnesses the power of
   thousands of parallel processing cores in NVIDIA GPUs. The solution
   allows users to easily ingest, store and analyze tens to hundreds of
   terabytes of data and more with significantly reduced infrastructure
   and manpower resources. The result is unparalleled power and
   flexibility to explore and analyze massive amounts of data. The latest
   investment reinforces the rising challenge facing enterprises to take
   full advantage of rapidly growing data stores.

   "SQream is uniquely positioned to provide enterprises with the solution
   they require to lower the barrier for accessing and analyzing rapidly
   growing, large-scale data stores in the cloud. We are pleased to expand
   our relationship with SQream, and work together to accelerate the
   growth of the cloud industry," said Chaoqun Zhan, Director of Alibaba
   Database Business.

   This strategic investment deepens the relationship between Alibaba
   Cloud and SQream. In February, the companies announced a collaboration
   agreement to provide Alibaba Cloud's customers with a cost effective
   way to set up, access and analyze data in the cloud, enabling more
   comprehensive analytics and previously unobtainable business
   intelligence.

   "We are very gratified with the vote of confidence we have received
   from this round's lead investor, Alibaba Group, and our other key
   investors," said Ami Gal, CEO and Co-founder of SQream. "The financing
   enables us to accelerate technological integration with ecosystem
   partners, and to grow our global sales and marketing team as we help
   enterprises worldwide meet the challenges of accessing and analyzing
   data from exponentially growing massive data stores."

   LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyperloop One today took
   another major step on its path to defining the future of
   transportation. The Company and the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority
   (RTA) agreed jointly to evaluate a Hyperloop One system in greater
   Dubai and the UAE. Hyperloop One will work with McKinsey & Co. and the
   Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) on a detailed feasibility study sponsored by
   the RTA. The agreement moves the company into its next stage of
   progress in Dubai following a successful engagement in the Dubai Future
   Accelerators, which culminated in a presentation of Hyperloop One's
   value proposition to His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al
   Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of
   Dubai.

   Additionally, Hyperloop One unveiled an original concept for autonomous
   transportation in the UAE, including designs for the world's first
   Hyperloop One Portals (the equivalent of a station or airport) and
   Hyperloop One Pods that can take passengers from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in
   12 minutes, compared to a two-hour drive. The work is the result of
   deep collaboration between Hyperloop One and BIG's amazing team of
   architects and engineers. Both announcements were revealed at the Burj
   Khalifa in Dubai.

   "Technology is evolving and transforming how we live, yet we lack real
   innovation in mass transportation and the current system has stagnated.
   Hyperloop One is focused on transport that's far more efficient, fast
   and clean. It will change the dynamics of how we move goods and
   people," said Shervin Pishevar, Executive Chairman, Hyperloop One.
   "Dubai makes perfect sense for Hyperloop One because this is the 21st
   century's global transport hub and its leaders understand that
   Hyperloop One is ushering in the next era of transportation."

   Under the terms the agreement, Hyperloop One will work with McKinsey
   and BIG to evaluate the implementation of a passenger Hyperloop in
   Dubai. This announcement is the second partner agreement Hyperloop One
   has signed in Dubai and the sixth worldwide. The Company announced a
   deal in August to pursue a cargo Hyperloop One system with ports
   operator DP World at its deepwater Jebel Ali port in Dubai. The
   Company's growing presence on the ground in the UAE underscores the
   demand for Hyperloop One technology for passengers and freight in the
   country.

   Chairman of the RTA, His Excellency Mattar Al Tayer, commented on the
   agreement, saying, "This is an opportunity to help transform the UAE
   from a technology consumer to a technology creator, incubating
   expertise for a new global industry, in line with the UAE's Vision
   2021. With Hyperloop One, we will create a new means of transportation,
   keeping our region at the forefront of transportation technology and
   innovation."

   Conceptual Vision
   The engineers, architects and designers from Hyperloop One and BIG have
   collaborated intensively for six months to produce a comprehensive
   human experience for Hyperloop travel. The Company is showcasing today
   the first-ever routes from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, several Portal sites
   throughout Dubai and the conceptual interiors and exteriors of the
   individual passenger Pods. The work is based on a detailed study of how
   an urban and inter-city transport network should integrate with the
   existing infrastructure. It's autonomous, point-to-point and vastly
   simplifies the experience of getting from your front door to your
   destination.

   "We're going to create a seamless experience that starts the moment you
   think about being somewhere – not going somewhere," said Josh Giegel,
   President of Engineering, Hyperloop One. "We don't sell cars, boats,
   trains, or planes. We sell time. This puts an end to us being a
   'pod-in-a-tube' or 'fast train from SF to LA' company."

   "With Hyperloop One we have given form to a mobility ecosystem of pods
   and portals, where the waiting hall has vanished along with waiting
   itself," says Bjarke Ingels, founder, BIG. "Collective commuting with
   individual freedom at near supersonic speed. We are heading for a
   future where our mental map of the city is completely reconfigured, as
   our habitual understanding of distance and proximity – time and space –
   is warped by this virgin form of travel."

   In less than two years, Hyperloop One has raised more than $160
   million, assembled a team of more than 200 world-class experts, and
   built a campus in Downtown LA, a test and safety site in the Nevada
   desert, and a 100,000-sq. ft. machine and tooling shop in North Las
   Vegas. In addition, the Company has established a global partner
   network with industry leaders such as GE, SNCF, DP World, AECOM, Arup,
   Systra, Ramboll, and KPMG.

   "The momentum is global and accelerating," adds Hyperloop One CEO Rob
   Lloyd. "The world will see the test of the first full-scale Hyperloop
   system in early 2017 at our Test and Safety Site in Nevada and we will
   have multiple operational Hyperloop systems within five years."

   FAIRFAX, Va., Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American
   Council for Technology and Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) today
   announced that it has awarded Andrew Robinson, Chief Executive Officer
   of Robbins-Gioia LLC, the prestigious Janice K. Mendenhall Spirit of
   Leadership Award for his significant contributions to the federal
   information technology (IT) community. Robinson was among 8 individuals
   recognized for their leadership and commitment to public service at the
   ACT-IAC 2016 Executive Leadership Conference (ELC) in Colonial
   Williamsburg, Virginia.

   Established in 2001, the Janice K. Mendenhall Spirit of Leadership
   Award commemorates the life of long-time civil servant Janice
   Mendenhall, an exceptional leader who was known for her dedication to
   mentoring others and strengthening government and industry relations.
   The award is the highest tribute ACT-IAC bestows annually.

   ACT President Margie Graves and IAC Chair Dave McClure presented
   Robinson with the award in recognition of his long history of
   leadership in ACT-IAC and his contributions to a more effective and
   innovative government. Prior to joining Robbins-Gioia in 2016, Andy
   Robinson has over 25 years of experience in the technology arena with a
   strong record of success as a solutions-oriented strategic leader at
   ICF International, Exeter Group, Gartner Group and Xerox. Throughout
   his career he has demonstrated a strong commitment to improving
   government, mentoring people and strengthening the community. As a
   volunteer and leader within ACT-IAC, he has contributed to its mission
   of advancing government in many areas. Robinson is a past IAC Chair and
   played a key role in standing-up the ACT-IAC Institute for
   Innovation. He has just completed three years as the first Chair of the
   Institute. Robinson is a member of the George Washington University
   Research Advisory Board and Center for Cyber and Homeland Security
   Advisory Board. He is also a member of the Program Management Institute
   Global Executive Council. He is board member of Rendez-vous: Haiti – a
   non-profit organization established after the 2010 earthquake to help
   the people of Haiti improve their lives through sustainable
   development.  His accomplishments and standards are in the best
   tradition of the Mendenhall Award.

   Graves and McClure also presented two individuals with the ACT-IAC
   Leaders Award in recognition of the exceptional contributions they have
   made to ACT-IAC and advancing government. Richard Spires, CEO
   of LearningTree International, was recognized for his leadership in
   developing the FITARA Maturity Model now being used in federal
   government to improve the management of technology. U.S. Chief
   Information Officer Tony Scott was recognized for his exceptional
   leadership in creating a more effective and innovative government
   through the use of technology. He was also acknowledged for his support
   of strong government-industry collaboration.

   The ACT-IAC Individual Contributor of the Year Award – Government was
   presented to Dan Morgan (Department of Transportation). The ACT-IAC
   Individual Contributor of the Year Award – Industry was presented to
   Chip Block (Evolver).  Both individuals were recognized for their
   significant contributions to ACT-IAC over the past year.

   The ACT-IAC Rookie of the Year Award was presented to Matt Sexton
   (Tista Science and Technology) and Zach Buss (Booz Allen
   Hamilton). This award honors individuals who are relatively new to
   ACT-IAC and, in a short time, have already demonstrated active
   involvement across a range of activities in the organization.

   The Ginny McCormick New Heights Award recognizes an individual who has
   made significant contributions as a volunteer – working quietly and
   effectively towards a more effective government. The 2016 award was
   presented to Dee Delaney (AT&T).

   "Part of what makes ACT-IAC unique and valuable is the engagement and
   passion of so many exceptional volunteers from both government and
   industry. The individuals who have been recognized this year represent
   the best of the best," said ACT-IAC Executive Director Kenneth Allen.
   "Through their dedication, their investment of personal time and their
   commitment to the idea that collaboration produces better outcomes, we
   are all winners in our quest to create a more effective and innovative
   government."

   SAN FRANCISCO, July 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Twitter announced today it
   has created an online application process for Twitter accounts to
   receive verified status. Verified accounts on Twitter allow people to
   identify key individuals and organizations on Twitter as authentic, and
   are denoted by a blue badge icon. An account may be verified if it is
   determined to be of public interest. Typically this includes accounts
   maintained by public figures and organizations in music, TV, film,
   fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports,
   business, and other key interest areas.

   "We want to make it even easier for people to find creators and
   influencers on Twitter so it makes sense for us to let people apply for
   verification," said Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter's vice president of User
   Services. "We hope opening up this application process results in more
   people finding great, high-quality accounts to follow, and for these
   creators and influencers to connect with a broader audience."

   Twitter was the first platform to introduce account verification,
   starting in 2009 and currently has close to 187,000 verified accounts.
   The @CDCgov was one of the first Twitter accounts to be verified in
   order to help citizens find authentic and accurate public health
   information straight from the source. Among the other first accounts to
   be verified include @NASAArmstrong, @KimKardashian, @Oprah,
   @MilwaukeePolice, @SF311, and @TonyHawk.

   The application process will start rolling out today and be available
   globally this week. People can learn more about the application process
   in the Twitter Help Center.
