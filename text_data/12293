   Alliance Française Dublin with musicologist Dr Laura Anderson is
   organising a 3-movie-cycle called "Disruptive Soundscapes" that will
   focus this year on the sound in the French New Wave.
   The first film of the season is Les Cousins (1959), one of the earliest
   French New Wave masterpieces which brought its director Claude Chabrol
   to critical attention and wide acclaim along with Le Beau Serge (1958).
   In her post-screening talk, Dr Anderson will situate the soundtrack for
   Les Cousins in relation to French New Wave film music and will discuss
   the film’s use of original music by Paul Misraki alongside extensive
   employment of pre-existing classical music, most notably from Wagner.

   of the Great Frenchman   80 Minutes with
   Seamus Heaney

   Tuesday 15 October – 5.30-7.30pm
   Admission free  [book.gif]

   In this new workshop, we will look at the concept of "global
   simulation", a pedagogical tool that offers a fictitious framework
   conducive to the realisation of social actions. The fact that the
   activities have meaning, are coherent and are aimed at the realisation
   of a common project contributes greatly to the commitment of the
   learners.
   We will see how to set up an overall simulation with your classes to
   create a developing project over several weeks.

   The workshop will be led by Gaële Mordelet, Course Director at Alliance
   Française Dublin. Places are limited, so be sure to book early!



   Thursday 17 October – 6.30pm

   Alliance Française Dublin is pleased to welcome the screening of the

   Zapateiro.
   In 1879, French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, creator of the Suez
   Canal and co-founder of the Alliance Française, embarked on the
   pharaonic project of the Panama Canal. But very quickly the attempt was
   foiled by epidemics, design flaws and financial scandals.
   In the presence of a descendant of Ferdinand de Lesseps.
