Very large dead zone forecast for the Gulf of Mexico

Very large dead zone forecast for the Gulf of Mexico

   Release Date: June 10, 2019

   NOAA's annual prediction based on USGS data

   NOAA scientists are forecasting this summer’s Gulf of Mexico hypoxic
   zone or ‘dead zone’ – an area of low to no oxygen that can kill fish
   and other marine life – to be approximately 7,829 square miles, or
   roughly the size of Massachusetts. The annual prediction is based on
   U.S. Geological Survey river flow and nutrient data.

   The 2019 forecast is close to the record size of 8,776 square miles set
   in 2017 and larger than the 5-year average measured size of 5,770
   square miles.

   The annually recurring Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone is primarily caused
   by excess nutrient pollution from human activities, such as
   urbanization and agriculture, occurring throughout the Mississippi
   River watershed. Once the excess nutrients reach the Gulf they
   stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which eventually die, then sink and
   decompose in the water. The resulting low oxygen levels near the bottom
   are insufficient to support most marine life and have long-term impacts
   to living marine resources that are unable to leave the area.
   Considered one of the world’s largest, the Gulf of Mexico dead zone
   occurs every summer.

   A major factor contributing to the large dead zone this year is the
   abnormally high amount of spring rainfall in many parts of the
   Mississippi River watershed, which led to record high river flows and
   much larger nutrient loading to the Gulf of Mexico. This past May,
   discharge in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers was about 67% above
   the long-term average between 1980 and 2018. USGS estimates that this
   larger-than average river discharge carried 156,000 metric tons of
   nitrate and 25,300 metric tons of phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico in
   May alone. These nitrate loads were about 18% above the long-term
   average, and phosphorus loads were about 49% above the long-term
   average.

   NOAA issues a dead zone forecast each year, and refines the models used
   by the Hypoxia Task Force to set nutrient reduction targets and better
   understand the link between hypoxia and nutrients. The forecast assumes
   typical coastal weather conditions, but the measured dead zone size
   could be disrupted and its size could change by major wind events,
   hurricanes and tropical storms which mix ocean waters, as occurred in
   2018. A NOAA-supported monitoring survey will confirm the size of the
   2019 Gulf dead zone in early August, a key test of the accuracy of the
   models.

   “The models help predict how hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico is linked to
   nutrient inputs coming from throughout the Mississippi River Basin,”
   said Steve Thur, Ph.D., director of NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal
   Ocean Science. “This year's historic and sustained river flows will
   test the accuracy of these models in extreme conditions, which are
   likely to occur more frequently in the future according to the latest
   National Climate Assessment. The assessment predicts an increase in the
   frequency of very heavy precipitation events in the Midwest, Great
   Plains, and Southeast regions, which would impact nutrient input to the
   northern Gulf of Mexico and the size of the hypoxic zone.”

   The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force, a
   group working to reduce the Gulf dead zone through nutrient reductions
   within the Mississippi River watershed, has set a 5-year average
   measured size target of 1,900 square miles.

   While nutrient inputs to the Gulf of Mexico vary from year to year
   because of natural swings in precipitation and discharge, USGS also
   tracks longer-term gradual changes in nitrate and phosphorus loading
   into the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River.

   “Long-term monitoring of the country's streams and rivers by the USGS
   has shown that while nitrogen loading into some other coastal estuaries
   has been decreasing, that is not the case in the Gulf of Mexico," said
   Don Cline, associate director for the USGS Water Resources Mission
   Area. "USGS monitoring and real-time sensors, coupled with watershed
   modeling, will continue to improve our understanding of the causes of
   these changes and the role they play in the Gulf and other coastal
   areas.”

   The USGS operates more than 3,000 real-time stream gauges, 50 real-time
   nitrate sensors, and 35 long-term monitoring sites throughout the
   Mississippi-Atchafalaya watershed, which drains all rivers and streams
   in parts or all of 31 states and 2 Canadian provinces into the Gulf of
   Mexico.

   This is the second year NOAA is producing its own independent forecast
   product, the culmination of a multi-year academic-federal partnership
   to develop a suite of NOAA-supported hypoxia forecast models. The
   partnership included teams of researchers at the University of
   Michigan, Louisiana State University, William & Mary’s Virginia
   Institute of Marine Science, North Carolina State University, Dalhousie
   University and USGS. The NOAA forecast integrates the results of these
   multiple independent models into a separate average forecast and is
   released in coordination with these external groups, some of which are
   also developing independent forecasts.

   NOAA and its partners continue to develop additional hypoxia forecast
   capabilities to understand impacts on living marine resources, better
   evaluate the role of phosphorus on the dead zone size, and understand
   the relationship between hypoxia volume and area.

EarthWord: Hypoxia

   Hypoxia sounds as bad as it is. It refers to an environment that is too
   low on oxygen to sustain most aerobic life, particularly an aquatic
   environment. Hypoxia is most problematic when it happens where oxygen
   is normally plentiful, because most living organisms require oxygen to
   continue living.

NOAA, Partners Predict an Average ’Dead Zone’ for Gulf of Mexico; Slightly
Above-average Hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay

   Scientists are expecting an average, but still large, hypoxic or "dead
   zone" in the Gulf of Mexico this year, and slightly above-average
   hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay.
