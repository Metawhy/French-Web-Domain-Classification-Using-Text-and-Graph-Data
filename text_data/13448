   A popular YouTube couple are accused of pretending to mandatorily
   evacuate their Orange County, California home during a wildfire all for
   some sweet, sweet ad dollars.

   Buzzfeed reports that on August 13, the LaBrants posted a vlog titled,
   “WE LEFT OUR HOUSE BECAUSE OF FIRES IN CALIFORNIA.”

   “Savannah texted me saying that there’s a huge fire right by our house,
   and we might need to evacuate,” says Cole. The video then cuts to news
   footage of the Holy Fire, which has burned over 22,000 acres and
   destroyed over 20 structures. They edited some sweet trop
   house/fauxggaeton over shots of the blaze. Cute touch!

   Later, Cole captures the faraway fire while he’s driving and while he’s
   on his roof.

   “I think it’s, like, four miles away,” he says, while a pregnant
   Savannah nods along. “And we just got an evacuation thing.”

   “Hopefully we never have to upload this, but if we do, then you guys
   kinda saw what happened,” he adds.

   Cole, ever the reliable narrator, says he packed a backpack full of
   essentials—listing only a camera and laptop—because they might not be
   able to return to their home that night. They also pack two suitcases;
   one for adults, another for a small child.

   Before they hit the road, Cole really sells this whole fire thing to
   us, saying, “It smells like fire. It smells like a thousand people
   smoking cigarettes out here!”

   Shortly after, the couple picks up Savannah’s daughter, Everleigh, from
   grandma’s house. Savannah assures Everleigh that they’re, “going away
   from the fire so you don’t have to be scared anymore.” Cole adds that
   Everleigh’s number one fear is fires.

   I don’t have kids, and I am not an expert in their behavior, but
   Everleigh doesn’t seem particularly concerned.

   Maybe it’s because she’s excited to go on vacation.

   The rest of the video briefly features the family’s escape from Orange
   County, en route to San Francisco. There, they check in at a hotel and
   go on an impromptu vacation. The video becomes a straight-up travel
   vlog about their time in San Francisco. From time to time, Cole gives a
   shout out to the fire that’s raging, but it comes across as an
   afterthought.

   Coincidentally, this all occurred around the anniversary of Cole asking
   Savannah to be his girlfriend, right by San Francisco’s Golden Gate
   Bridge.

   It’s not as if the LaBrants are the only YouTubers to feature
   misleading titles on their videos, but that’s not the only thing
   that’ll leave you scratching your head. It turns out, the LaBrants
   never needed to evacuate in the first place!

   From Buzzfeed:

     The LaBrants live in Ladera Ranch, California, according to public
     records[...]Ladera Ranch is not one of the communities listed as an
     evacuated area for the Holy fire, according to the National Wildfire
     Coordinating Group website.

     [...]

     Neighbors of the couple told Fox 11 they were never evacuated, and
     they found the couple’s video upsetting.

     [...]

     “I just think it’s really sad they would exploit a situation that’s
     as serious as a fire that so many people were evacuated just so they
     could get more likes or more hits on their channel,” one neighbor
     told Fox 11.

   Here’s another account from a Ladera resident:

   The LaBrants were clearly exploiting this fire for views. Check out the
   initial thumbnail for the video depicted a worried looking LaBrant
   family in the forefront while a fire raged behind them:

   The couple has yet to respond to the criticism.

   Cole and Savannah (and Everleigh) are massive on social media, each
   boasting over three million Instagram followers and six million
   subscribers on their joint YouTube channel, Cole&Sav.

   Advertisement

   Their channel largely features videos of the family doing seemingly
   run-of-the-mill activities and playing pranks on each other. But Cole
   and Savannah’s overall brand focuses heavily on their Christian faith,
   their Christian family, and their (Christian???) hotness. And with this
   new controversy, their brand can expand to exploiting terrible
   situations for clicks.

Parents Accused of Abandoning Their 9-Year-Old Child Say She Was Actually a
Fully-Grown, Mentally Unwell Adult

   Illustration for article titled Parents Accused of Abandoning Their
   9-Year-Old Child Say She Was Actually a Fully-Grown, Mentally Unwell
   Adult
   Screenshot: Orphan

   Perhaps you’re familiar with the positively blood-freezing horror movie
   Orphan, in which (SPOILER!) a mysterious 9-year-old adopted by a
   well-meaning family turns out to be a murderous 33-year-old? Just a
   movie, you say? Not so, says the Daily Mail, which brings us a
   similarly fucking terrifying tale of a mentally disturbed adult posing
   as a child.

   Back in 2010, Kristine and Michael Barnett thought they were coming to
   the rescue of a 6-year-old Ukrainian girl named Natalia Grace, adopting
   her under shadowy circumstances about which they were too polite to ask
   questions. Instead, they wound up with a full grown adult with
   dwarfism—and, it turns out, some extreme psychiatric problems. As
   Kristine Barnett told the Mail:

     ‘She would make statements and draw pictures saying she wanted to
     kill family members, roll them up in a blanket and put them in the
     backyard,’ she told DailyMailTV.

     ‘She was standing over people in the middle of the night. You
     couldn’t go to sleep. We had to hide all the sharp objects.

     ‘I saw her putting chemicals, bleach, Windex something like that, in
     my coffee and I asked her, what are you doing? She said, “I am
     trying to poison you.”

   Advertisement

   OKAY! Later, the Barnetts were charged with neglect for allegedly
   abandoning Natalia, which they argue is obviously not possible
   considering she was an adult all along, Barnett said:

     “Natalia was a woman. She had periods. She had adult teeth. She
     never grew a single inch, which would happen even with a child with
     dwarfism.

     ‘The doctors all confirmed she was suffering a severe psychological
     illness only diagnosed in adults.

     ‘She was jumping out of moving cars. She was smearing blood on
     mirrors. She was doing things you could never imagine a little child
     doing.’

   Barnett said that her suspicions about Natalia’s age continued to mount
   in the months after her adoption, and eventually, she sought a bone
   density test to learn the truth. The results suggested she was at least
   14, but rather than running for the hills like some might have done,
   Barnett said she instead recalibrated her approach and treat her more
   appropriately for her age. Despite this, Natalia’s behavior
   deteriorated, and she did everything from attacking a baby to trying to
   push Barnett into an electric fence.

   After spending time in psychiatric facilities, the Barnetts were able
   to get Natalia’s legal age “corrected” from 8 to 22, in order to get
   her treated as an adult. Despite the jig being up, the Barnetts said
   they rented Natalia an apartment and helped her come up with a plan to
   earn her high school diploma and enroll in school for cosmetology:

     ‘I co-signed the lease and paid for the rent up front for a year. I
     did everything you would do when you send your child off to college,
     I helped her with groceries and bought furniture at Target for her.

     ‘I was optimistic, she had a concrete plan for her life. She had
     food stamps. She had social security income for the rest of her
     things. She had demonstrated she was able to live.’

   Advertisement

   Earlier this month, an affidavit revealed that Natalia herself told
   police in 2014 she’d been abandoned, which doesn’t explain why police
   waited five years to charge Michael Barnett, who had since divorced
   Kristine. The affidavit added that “when an officer spoke with Michael
   on September 5 he admitted he knew all along that Natalia was a minor
   child when she was allegedly abandoned, and that “Michael Barnett
   admitted Kristine Barnett told Natalia to tell others Natalia looks
   young but was actually 22.”

   What. The. Fuck. Read the full story at the Daily Mail here.

   Illustration for article titled Pop Culture Meets Reproduction: Stars,
   Surrogacy, And Adoption

   Two news stories today examine our most important source for
   information about reproductive choices: the movies!

   First up, stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick recently had
   twins via surrogate. This leads Jane Brody of the New York Times to
   examine surrogacy in general. Sure, there's a stigma: surrogacy "has
   been called a violation of natural law, a form of prostitution or baby
   selling, an exploitation of poor women, and a privilege of the rich and
   famous [where would anyone get that idea?] who may not want to disrupt
   their careers or their figures by giving birth to their own children."
   However, lawyer Melissa Brisman, whose children were carried by
   surrogates, says, "People don't become gestational carriers as a way of
   making money. Rather, their motives are altruistic." Brody doesn't
   really interrogate this assertion much, other than offering the
   admittedly heartwarming story of Pamela MacPhee, who acted as a
   surrogate for a cousin who was infertile due to cancer. Surrogacy can
   have complex moral and economic ramifications, none of which really get
   much play here.

   Next, adoption advocates are worried that the new film Orphan, with its
   depiction of an evil adopted girl, will discourage families from
   adopting older children. The Christian Alliance for Orphans has made a
   website in response to the film, which cites studies showing that
   adopted teens do better in school and have less depression than the
   non-adopted. The site also reports that kids who are adopted generally
   do just as well as kids who aren't, and far better than children who
   stay in abusive homes or in foster care. Despite this comforting
   information, the CEO of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption
   Institute fears that Orphan "may impede recruitment efforts by feeding
   into the unconscious fears of potential foster and adoptive families
   that orphaned children are psychotic and unable to heal from the wounds
   of abuse, neglect, and abandonment."

   But the movie may not be the problem. Times blogger Lisa Belkin says of
   the Christian Alliance's website: "I have to admit, some of these facts
   surprised me. For years I'd heard stories of older adoptions that ran
   into trouble, and while I like to think that a horror film would not
   sway me, I am realizing that anecdote over the years already has."
   Surrogacy and adoption are both, as Brody and Belkin point out,
   frequently misunderstood. But the solution is more information — not
   more "anecdotes" like the ones Brody provides.

   Illustration for article titled The Ukrainian Orphan Who Is Actually
   Maybe an Adult Has Been Found in Indiana
   Screenshot: Orphan

   The story of the 6-year-old Ukrainian orphan who may or may not have
   actually been a murderous adult has raised many, many questions among
   those fascinated by her case, but the most pressing one is definitely,
   “Where is she now?” Well, good news for us! Natalia has been found, and
   she’s... living with another family in Indiana.

   According to the Daily Mail, Natalia Barnett is living with a Christian
   couple “who consider her their teen daughter.” As the tabloid put it:
   “But depending on whom you believe, the bubbly, baby-faced ‘youngster’
   is either a 16-year-old girl—or a 30-year-old ‘sociopath’ masquerading
   as a child.”

   Advertisement

   Natalia’s adoptive parents, Antwon and Cynthia Mans, wisely declined to
   talk to the Mail when approached for an interview, though they’re long
   aware of the controversy around her age. As you’ll recall, Natalia was
   found abandoned and/or living in an apartment in 2013 after her former
   adoptive family, the Barnetts, moved to Canada without her. But
   contrary to what one may think, the Barnetts didn’t abandon Natalia
   because of her alleged habit of trying to poison their coffee with
   bleach or standing over them while they were sleeping. They simply
   concluded she was actually an adult with a rare form of dwarfism posing
   as a child and, after helping her come up with a plan to get her life
   together, left her behind when they moved.

   The Mans seem to have entered Natalia’s life between 2013 and 2016,
   when they applied to become her legal guardians, though they withdrew
   the petition when the court upheld an earlier ruling that Natalia was
   born in 1989 and not 2003. Even if she is an adult, the Mans seem to
   have determined that they’re committed to her.

   “The Mans care for Natalia and she likes being there,” a friend told
   the tabloid. “There’s nothing crazy going on or anything. These are
   good people,” the friend said, adding,

     “They just so happened to come across this person that was not being
     treated right and cared enough to put in the effort to make sure
     something was done about it. If it’s true that her parents had
     abandoned her, it’s horrible.

     “I’m not a doctor or a psychiatrist but I’ve spoken with Natalia and
     I believe her. If you’re asking me if I think she is 30, that’s
     ridiculous.”

   Advertisement

   Lots to unravel here, but first: Has Natalia ever tried to push anyone
   in the Mans family into an electric fence?

   Ming, a 400-pound tiger who was found 16 years ago living inside an
   apartment in New York’s Harlem neighborhood, has died. He was 19 years
   old.

   NBC New York reports that Ming died peacefully at the Noah’s Lost Ark
   Exotic Animal Rescue Center in Ohio back in February, but news of his
   passing only made it to reporters just now. The tiger was cremated in
   the spring and interred at Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Westchester, not
   far from where he spent his cubhood.

   Indeed, for the first three years of his life, Ming lived in an
   apartment on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard in Harlem with his human
   owner, one Antoine Yates, in addition to an alligator and a number of
   other animal roommates. According to the New York Daily News, on
   September 30, 2003, Yates went to an area hospital seeking treatment
   for some wounds. Doctors determined he’d been attacked by a large
   animal, and when police showed up at Yates’s fifth-floor apartment,
   they found Ming (who became belligerent when Yates brought home another
   cat, as cats often do).

   Ming was removed from the apartment and sent to Noah’s Lost Ark, where,
   like many former New Yorkers before him, he reportedly enjoyed much
   more space and good times. “He lived a really good life here,” Karnofel
   told the Daily News. “He was able to run and play on the grounds. He
   had tiger friends. He had a swimming pool. He as able to experience the
   elements.”

   The News says Ming died of kidney and heart failure. Tigers in
   captivity tend to live 16 to 18 years, so Ming had a nice, long life.
   RIP, buddy.
