Corporate Social Responsibility

   NETGEAR is committed to ensuring the highest standards of social
   responsibility regardless of where our products are made. Under
   NETGEAR’s corporate social responsibility program there are five main
   pillars.

   Ethics

   Labor with Dignity (including California Transparency in Supply Chain
   Act of 2010 and UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015)

   Regulatory and Environmental Compliance

   Health and Safety

   Management Systems

   Being a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA – formerly
   known as Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC)), NETGEAR
   fully supports the vision and goals of the RBA. We endorse the RBA Code
   of Conduct, and incorporate RBA standards into the NETGEAR Corporate
   Supplier Code of Conduct. Our corporate social responsibility program
   includes various initiatives and monitoring activities which reinforce
   our commitment as a responsible global citizen. NETGEAR conducts a risk
   assessment and performs audits on significant third party manufacturing
   locations at least once a year, which we target to cover no less than
   80% of our total production. Results from audits are shared and agreed
   with suppliers, and supplier corrective action requests, if needed, are
   subsequently followed up during the Quarterly Business Review led by
   the Operations Department.
