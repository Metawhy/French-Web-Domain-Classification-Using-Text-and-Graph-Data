Our story

   We embarked on this adventure with the same passion for pretty &
   eco-friendly things. We wanted to create items that had style and that
   were sustainable, which is how we came about making our products.

   Our mission today is to inspire people to change their daily habits,
   but also to give them the simple & green tools to do so.

Furoshiki

   The prettiest and most eco-friendly gift wrapper!

   Made with a lovely organic hemp/cotton fabric that will never go out of
   style, this Furoshiki is the perfect way to wrap a gift. You’ll even be
   able to use it afterwards as a dish rag since it is very light and
   dries quickly. It’s also great to carry your lunch around.

   Furoshiki is an ancient Japanese method to wrap with linen. We use it
   to wrap gifts, lunches or to transport small items.

   28"x28"

   Learn all about this method by watching our video right here

   Machine wash in cold water. Hang to dry.
