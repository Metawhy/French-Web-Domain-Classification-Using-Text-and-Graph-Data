What is Notepad++

   News about Notepad++ new website

   Notepad++ is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”)
   source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several
   languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed
   by GPL License.

   Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written
   in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution
   speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as
   possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to
   reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power,
   the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a
   greener environment.

   I hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.
