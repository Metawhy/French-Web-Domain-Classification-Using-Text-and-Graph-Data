Senate committee approves sanctions bill against Burma

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 12^th, the US Committee on Foreign Relations has approved a
   bill (Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act of 2017) providing for
   economic sanctions and travel ban against Burmese military officials
   responsible for human rights violations against the Rohingya community.

   The bill also plans to limit military cooperation unless the Burmese
   military demonstrates significant progress in respect of human rights
   standards. The bill must now be passed by the Senate.

Government announces strengthening arms export control on human-rights
concerns

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   Since the sale by Canada of armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia in 2016,
   the authorities are regularly criticized for not taking into
   consideration, in the license application review, the possibility that
   armaments may be used in violation of human rights.

   For the first time, on February 8^th, Canadian Foreign Minister
   Chrystia Freeland announced in an allocution that “[Canada] would not
   allow the export of a controlled good if there was a substantial risk
   that it would be used to commit human rights violations”.

   Following this announcement, Canadian government demanded a second
   review of the 16 Canadian helicopters sale contract to Philippines, to
   ensure that its use by Philippines armed forces would not contradict
   human rights. In this context, the President of the
   Philippines requested the cancellation of the contract.

Total CEO urges Trump to maintain Iranian nuclear agreement

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   According to Reuters, the CEO of Total Patrick Pouyanné might have
   urged Donald Trump to maintain the Iran nuclear agreement. The oil
   group, already active in Iran, has argued that Western investments
   could help support local reformers to promote democracy.

   As a reminder, President Trump extended the suspension of economic
   sanctions against Iran last January and set a deadline of 120 days to
   correct “the terrible defects” of which, according to him, this
   agreement, signed in Vienna the 14^th July of 2015, suffers.

Further SFO charges in Barclays 2008 Qatar capital raising case

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 12, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced that it has
   charged Barclays Bank Plc, a subsidiary of Barclays Plc. The charges
   relate to the financial assistance Barclays Bank Plc gave to Qatar
   Holding LLC between 1 October and 30 November 2008, which was in the
   form of a USD 3 billion loan.

   This follows charges brought against the holding company, Barclays Plc,
   and four individuals in June 2017, whose trial has been set for January
   2019 (see our newsletter of 06/26/2018).

Norway’s wealth fund sets out new expectations for companies regarding the
prevention of corruption

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 13, Norway’s wealth fund – managed by Norges Bank
   Investment Management – set out new expectations for the companies it
   invests in, regarding the way they prevent and fight corruption
   internally.

   The fund said in a statement it expects “boards to ensure that the
   company sets a clear policy on anti-corruption and that relevant
   measures are integrated into business strategy, risk management and
   reporting”. A day earlier, the Ethisphere Institute had released “The
   2018 World’s Most Ethical Companies Honoree List” honoring the 135 most
   ethical companies in the world.

A new law makes mandatory compliance programs for companies contracting with
the public administration of the Federal District

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 6, a new law was adopted by the Federal District – one of
   the 27 districts of Brazil  – requiring the implementation of a
   compliance program by companies seeking to enter into contracts,
   partnerships, agreements, concessions, or public-private partnerships
   with the public administration of the Federal District, in amounts
   equal to or greater than the bidding price, estimated between BRL
   80,000 and BRL 650,000.

   This requirement only applies to contracts with a term equal to or
   greater than 180 days. In case of non-compliance with the law
   requirements, a fine of 0.1% of the contract value may be daily
   imposed. Earlier in December 2017, the district of Rio de Janeiro had
   already published a similar law, making it mandatory for companies
   entering into contract with the public administration of the State of
   Rio de Janeiro to implement a compliance program (see our newsletter of
   12/11/2017).

The former president and the Oxfam’s chairman arrested as part of a
corruption probe

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 13, the former Guatemalan President, Alvaro Colom, and the
   former finance minister, Juan Alberto Fuentes – who is now chairman of
   Oxfam International –, were arrested by Guatemalan authorities as part
   of a local corruption investigation (Reuters, 02/13/2014).

   The investigation is reportedly looking at buses procurement contracts
   for the capital city (amounting to USD 35 million) which were awarded
   to four companies through a bidding process, and were allegedly
   inflated.

Resignation of the President over corruption scandals

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 14, Jacob Zuma announced his resignation as President of
   South Africa “with immediate effect” after the ruling African National
   Congress party ordered him to step down, following several corruption
   scandals.

   His resignation came just hours after police raided the luxury home of
   the Gupta family, billionaire allies of the former president who have
   been at the centre of corruption allegations against Jacob Zuma and his
   circle for years. On February 15, Cyril Ramaphosa was elected President
   of South Africa.

Two ex-principals of an Engie’s affiliate confess having participated to a
public officials corruption scheme

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 7, the former commercial director of Cofely, a Spanish
   subsidiary of Engie, confessed to judicial authorities that the company
   “had a specific fund to bribe public officials from several
   municipalities in exchange of the award of energy efficiency
   contracts”, according to El País. Le Figaro indicates that the
   kickbacks – from 2% to 3% of the total contract’s worth –
   were distributed to a dozen Spanish cities’ officials, from contracts
   representing a total amount of 300 million euros. On February 9,
   another ex-director of Cofely declared that the Cofely’s Managing
   Director at the time, was aware of such practices and that “Spanish
   managers of Cofely had to inform the headquarters in Paris of all the
   projects that exceeded 500,000 euros and had to ask for their signature
   for those that were over one million euros”.

   This case is a branch of the Punica Operation, which started in Spain
   in 2014 and revealed a large corruption scheme in the attribution of
   public contracts involving Spanish politicians, mostly members of
   the Partido Popular. Official investigations started in 2014 and
   according to El Español, ” Anticorruption Prosecutor’s Office expects
   to be able to present its report to the judge soon for the trial to
   begin “.

and British corruption investigations

   Posted on 19 February 2018 by globulebleu

   On February 15^th, Airbus announced, in a note accompanying its 2017
   results, that it will fully cooperate with US authorities on French and
   British corruption investigations that could fall within US
   jurisdiction. US authorities requested information relating to the
   investigations conducted by the Parquet National Financier (PNF) and
   the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) on allegations of fraud, bribery and
   corruption, as part of the use of intermediaries in the civil
   activities of Airbus.

   The aeronautics and defense company announced, moreover, that it has
   informed US authorities of irregularities in certain export contracts
   of military equipment.
