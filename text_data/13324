       By Dan Maloney | September 25, 2019
       It is said that Benjamin Franklin, while watching the first manned

       1783, responded when questioned as to the practical value of such a
       thing, “Of what practical use is a new-born baby?” Dr. Franklin

       By Danie Conradie | September 24, 2019
       We may not always be aware of it, but the daily function of the
       technological world around us is extremely dependent on satellite
