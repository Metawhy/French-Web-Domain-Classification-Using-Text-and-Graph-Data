Macroeconomic Policies in UK After 2008

   Multinational corporations, governments and even economies as a whole
   have continued to face the effects of major financial crises that have
   occurred since time immemorial. These tragic events have led to the
   collapse of many companies, entered countries into significant debt and
   also raised the unemployment levels significantly. However, with every
   form of financial crisis that has taken place, developed countries; for
   example the United Kingdom, have strived to come up with policies to
   recover, boost and safeguard their economies against such events in the
   future.

   An example of such a tragic event is the global financial crisis of
   2008. This has been described as the worst financial crisis globally
   since the Great Depression that took place in the 1930s.  In the United
   Kingdom, the Bank of England was most affected as it had to support
   other organizations mainly mortgage companies. This is because with the
   onset of the financial crisis of 2008, reputable mortgage lenders in
   the United Kingdom collapsed. Generally in the United Kingdom, the
   economy went into recession into the second quarter of the year 2008
   and eventually started gaining financial prowess towards the end of the
   year 2009. This forced the United Kingdom government to come up with
   macro-economic policies that would aid the country to survive the
   financial crisis and protect them against future calamities.

   Macroeconomic policies adopted after the global financial crisis

   These macroeconomic policies adopted in the United Kingdom can be
   divided into monetary and fiscal policies. Fiscal policies are the
   strategies adopted by a government that deal with the government’s
   public spending and taxation. Monetary policies deal with interest
   rates and the supply of money in the country.

   Fiscal Policies

              As mentioned above, fiscal policies deal with those policies
   set by the government on taxation, public spending and public spending.
   Looking at some of the fiscal policies, one of the major strategies
   that were enforced was the 2008 bank rescue package. This rescue
   package was initiated to revive the banking sector from significant
   losses that had been incurred. It was comprised of providing money to
   the Bank of England through the Special Liquidity Scheme, providing
   money through the Bank Recapitalization Fund that would help increase
   the banks market capitalization and by providing loan guarantees of up
   to 250 billion pounds.

   Primarily the rescue package was described by 500 billion pounds that
   were injected into the United Kingdom in the form of loans and
   guarantees. This facilitated the purchase of shares for most banks in
   the United Kingdom that would later on add value to them and increase
   their demand. This in exchange would provide capital to huge banks in
   the United Kingdom which they would use to pay up their debts as well
   as have enough funds to support both individuals and businesses. The
   Bank of England provided an additional £200 billion into the money
   markets with the aim of lowering the London Interbank Offered Rate and
   to improve the country’s liquidity position.

   This was evidenced as the Bank of England, through its  Special
   Liquidity Scheme, aided in swapping mortgages that had been considered
   to be risky for treasury bonds with low interest rates This was
   important as it would ensure that the banks’ lenders would still do
   business with the British banks including Abbey, Barclays, HBOS among
   others.

   Another example of the fiscal policies put in place was reducing the
   tax rates so as reduce the financial burden faced by the British
   citizens. This is because with the country being in debt, unemployment
   was increasing and therefore it would be difficult for the citizens to
   sustain their expenditure in relation to taxation. An example of this
   is a 2.5% reduction in the value added tax for a period of up to one
   year. Another example was the 120 GBP tax deductions for all basic tax
   payers in the year 2009. Taxation on land was removed on properties
   that had a value of 175,000 pounds and those below this amount.
   Corporate tax was also reduced in the same year by 2%. This would aid
   in improving the country’s deficit by reducing expenses and increasing
   revenue.

   Monetary Policies

   Monetary policies usually involve using financial or monetary tools to
   influence and determine the interest rates as well as to influence
   aggregate demand, the consumer spending levels in a country, maintain
   inflation at an acceptable level. Additionally, they consider crucial
   macroeconomic elements including the rate of unemployment in a country.

   In the United Kingdom, monetary policies are usually set by the
   Monetary Policy Committee, an independent body that is part of the Bank
   of England. During and after the 2008 financial crisis, various
   monetary policies were pursued in the U.K. to aid in boosting the
   country’s aggregate demand. With the aim of easing up the LIBOR and
   various interest rates in the U.K, the Bank of England through the MPC
   reduced the discount rates by approximately 4.5 basis points within six
   months. This was from a base rate of 5% in late October 2008 to 0.5% in
   March the following year. This monetary policy was put in place with
   the aim of reviving spending by consumers in the United Kingdom as it
   discourages consumers from saving money. With low interest rates,
   consumers would not reap the benefits of saving money and so this
   policy aided in increasing the aggregate demand in the United Kingdom.
   Additionally, it enabled capital to be readily available for
   individuals and consumers at a cheaper rate.

   Another monetary policy that was pursued in the United Kingdom after
   the 2008 financial crisis was significant borrowing from other
   providers of finance. The country borrowed excessively and spent a lot
   of cash with the aim of increasing the money supply in the British
   economy. These funds mainly came from the Bank of England. The Bank of
   England also participate in quantitative easing which was also another
   form of a monetary policy adopted to ease the effects of the financial
   crisis. This is the process of increasing the money supply in an
   economy by actively acquiring assets, securities among other financial
   instruments. Between 2009 and 2012, the United Kingdom created money of
   up to 375 billion pounds that were injected into the country’s economy
   as part of the quantitative easing process. This money was used to buy
   bonds and other securities from financial institutions which would
   reduce their interest rates and make them attractive to citizens.
   People would then borrow more and have more money which they can spend
   and this would eventually help in boosting the country’s economy.

   In terms of the exchange rate, the Bank of England did not interfere as
   such with the determinants of foreign currency in their country. The
   sterling pound during the financial crisis decreased in currency value
   by up to 25%. This aided them to some extent as it increased the
   amounts of goods being exported as they would be cheaper to acquire. On
   the other hand, however, importation of goods would be quite expensive
   for the country.

   Conclusion

   To date, the British economy is still recovering from the effects of
   the financial crisis of 2008. The various macroeconomic policies that
   they adopted have been quite useful in restoring their economy and some
   of them are still in place to be used to aim at boosting the country’s
   economy more and more. The unemployment rate during the financial
   crisis increased to 8.5%. Currently, the unemployment rate stands at
   5.4% showing that the monetary policies in place have been beneficial
   in reducing the unemployment rate in UK. The rate of inflation has gone
   back to what is perceived to be normal in the United Kingdom. This is
   also the same case for the GDP which has improved since the financial
   crisis. However, the government should continually seek to improve
   these policies to prevent the effects of any unprecedented global
   calamity that might affect their economy.

   2008. This has been described as the worst financial crisis globally
   since the Great Depression that took place in the 1930s.  In the United
   Kingdom, the Bank of England was most affected as it had to support
   other organizations mainly mortgage companies. This is because with the
   onset of the financial crisis of 2008, reputable mortgage lenders in
   the United Kingdom collapsed. Generally in the United Kingdom, the
   economy went into recession into the second quarter of the year 2008
   and eventually started gaining financial prowess towards the end of the
   year 2009. This forced the United Kingdom government to come up with
   macro-economic policies that would aid the country to survive the
   financial crisis and protect them against future calamities.

   Macroeconomic policies adopted after the global financial crisis

   These macroeconomic policies adopted in the United Kingdom can be
   divided into monetary and fiscal policies. Fiscal policies are the
   strategies adopted by a government that deal with the government’s
   public spending and taxation. Monetary policies deal with interest
   rates and the supply of money in the country.

   Fiscal Policies

              As mentioned above, fiscal policies deal with those policies
   set by the government on taxation, public spending and public spending.
   Looking at some of the fiscal policies, one of the major strategies
   that were enforced was the 2008 bank rescue package. This rescue
   package was initiated to revive the banking sector from significant
   losses that had been incurred. It was comprised of providing money to
   the Bank of England through the Special Liquidity Scheme, providing
   money through the Bank Recapitalization Fund that would help increase
   the banks market capitalization and by providing loan guarantees of up
   to 250 billion pounds.

   Primarily the rescue package was described by 500 billion pounds that
   were injected into the United Kingdom in the form of loans and
   guarantees. This facilitated the purchase of shares for most banks in
   the United Kingdom that would later on add value to them and increase
   their demand. This in exchange would provide capital to huge banks in
   the United Kingdom which they would use to pay up their debts as well
   as have enough funds to support both individuals and businesses. The
   Bank of England provided an additional £200 billion into the money
   markets with the aim of lowering the London Interbank Offered Rate and
   to improve the country’s liquidity position.

   This was evidenced as the Bank of England, through its  Special
   Liquidity Scheme, aided in swapping mortgages that had been considered
   to be risky for treasury bonds with low interest rates This was
   important as it would ensure that the banks’ lenders would still do
   business with the British banks including Abbey, Barclays, HBOS among
   others.

   Another example of the fiscal policies put in place was reducing the
   tax rates so as reduce the financial burden faced by the British
   citizens. This is because with the country being in debt, unemployment
   was increasing and therefore it would be difficult for the citizens to
   sustain their expenditure in relation to taxation. An example of this
   is a 2.5% reduction in the value added tax for a period of up to one
   year. Another example was the 120 GBP tax deductions for all basic tax
   payers in the year 2009. Taxation on land was removed on properties
   that had a value of 175,000 pounds and those below this amount.
   Corporate tax was also reduced in the same year by 2%. This would aid
   in improving the country’s deficit by reducing expenses and increasing
   revenue.

   Monetary Policies

   Monetary policies usually involve using financial or monetary tools to
   influence and determine the interest rates as well as to influence
   aggregate demand, the consumer spending levels in a country, maintain
   inflation at an acceptable level. Additionally, they consider crucial
   macroeconomic elements including the rate of unemployment in a country.

   In the United Kingdom, monetary policies are usually set by the
   Monetary Policy Committee, an independent body that is part of the Bank
   of England. During and after the 2008 financial crisis, various
   monetary policies were pursued in the U.K. to aid in boosting the
   country’s aggregate demand. With the aim of easing up the LIBOR and
   various interest rates in the U.K, the Bank of England through the MPC
   reduced the discount rates by approximately 4.5 basis points within six
   months. This was from a base rate of 5% in late October 2008 to 0.5% in
   March the following year. This monetary policy was put in place with
   the aim of reviving spending by consumers in the United Kingdom as it
   discourages consumers from saving money. With low interest rates,
   consumers would not reap the benefits of saving money and so this
   policy aided in increasing the aggregate demand in the United Kingdom.
   Additionally, it enabled capital to be readily available for
   individuals and consumers at a cheaper rate.

   Another monetary policy that was pursued in the United Kingdom after
   the 2008 financial crisis was significant borrowing from other
   providers of finance. The country borrowed excessively and spent a lot
   of cash with the aim of increasing the money supply in the British
   economy. These funds mainly came from the Bank of England. The Bank of
   England also participate in quantitative easing which was also another
   form of a monetary policy adopted to ease the effects of the financial
   crisis. This is the process of increasing the money supply in an
   economy by actively acquiring assets, securities among other financial
   instruments. Between 2009 and 2012, the United Kingdom created money of
   up to 375 billion pounds that were injected into the country’s economy
   as part of the quantitative easing process. This money was used to buy
   bonds and other securities from financial institutions which would
   reduce their interest rates and make them attractive to citizens.
   People would then borrow more and have more money which they can spend
   and this would eventually help in boosting the country’s economy.

   In terms of the exchange rate, the Bank of England did not interfere as
   such with the determinants of foreign currency in their country. The
   sterling pound during the financial crisis decreased in currency value
   by up to 25%. This aided them to some extent as it increased the
   amounts of goods being exported as they would be cheaper to acquire. On
   the other hand, however, importation of goods would be quite expensive
   for the country.

   Conclusion

   To date, the British economy is still recovering from the effects of
   the financial crisis of 2008. The various macroeconomic policies that
   they adopted have been quite useful in restoring their economy and some
   of them are still in place to be used to aim at boosting the country’s
   economy more and more. The unemployment rate during the financial
   crisis increased to 8.5%. Currently, the unemployment rate stands at
   5.4% showing that the monetary policies in place have been beneficial
   in reducing the unemployment rate in UK. The rate of inflation has gone
   back to what is perceived to be normal in the United Kingdom. This is
   also the same case for the GDP which has improved since the financial
   crisis. However, the government should continually seek to improve
   these policies to prevent the effects of any unprecedented global
   calamity that might affect their economy.

Macroeconomic Policies in UK After 2008

   Multinational corporations, governments and even economies as a whole
   have continued to face the effects of major financial crises that have
   occurred since time immemorial. These tragic events have led to the
   collapse of many companies, entered countries into significant debt and
   also raised the unemployment levels significantly. However, with every

Could you count on MasterPapers.com? Find out in this article!

   We’ve acquired numerous requirements in the last few months for a
   MasterPapers evaluation, and since we have adequate information and
   feedback to provide us an inspiration, we imagined it would be a great
   time to build our own examination of their features. In order to
   provide our viewers the solutions that they expect, we chose the basic
   “attack” system: we read the on-site written content, reports, the
   off-site assessments, and we in addition put our own request for a
   college-stage research document.

    The Product

   MasterPapers presents the ordinary services of academic article
   writing, which may be effortlessly found on the menu of the purchase
   form. It delivers a broad selection of grades, going from the basic
   high-school article to a much more detailed dissertation chapter.
   Considering the fact that there are no trial samples on the
   MasterPapers, we could not make a first thought on their articles apart
   from the four, small landing pages. Nonetheless, even there, we
   discovered many lexical mistakes which reveal that the writer was in
   all likelihood foreign.

   What is more, we researched the article that we were given which gave
   the impression to have identical mistakes as the website material did.
   The structure was disorganized and the thesis statement was likewise
   absent - and that is a factor that the majority of professors are
   seeking.

   The Entire Workers

   The second thing we plan to learn about a copywriting website is the
   certainty that we are coping with live people. We attempt to find
   different ways to communicate with the client employees, but we got
   almost nothing: it had no phone numbers, no e-mails, and no chats. No
   wonder that some of testimonials on MasterPapers aren’t really good.

   We additionally couldn’t recognize if the copywriters are actually
   trained for what they do. We discussed with our author and had the
   possibility of trying for their qualifications, but besides that,
   MasterPapers doesn’t concentrate a lot on grade control.

   The Funds

   Simply because this organization goes by the bidding method, there
   isn’t a price information anywhere. They are specified depending on the
   dialogue involving the users and the copywriters - which is why there
   isn’t defined discount rates information either. We were capable of
   getting a 10% discount on our report, which almost created for the
   deficiency of promo codes and discount coupons. Our paper cost us $118,
   which was rather low-cost in comparison to alternative offerings.

Macroeconomic Policies in UK After 2008

   Multinational corporations, governments and even economies as a whole
   have continued to face the effects of major financial crises that have
   occurred since time immemorial. These tragic events have led to the
   collapse of many companies, entered countries into significant debt and
   also raised the unemployment levels significantly. However, with every
   form of financial crisis that has taken place, developed countries; for
   example the United Kingdom, have strived to come up with policies to
   recover, boost and safeguard their economies against such events in the
   future.

   An example of such a tragic event is the global financial crisis of
   2008. This has been described as the worst financial crisis globally
   since the Great Depression that took place in the 1930s.  In the United
   Kingdom, the Bank of England was most affected as it had to support
   other organizations mainly mortgage companies. This is because with the
   onset of the financial crisis of 2008, reputable mortgage lenders in
   the United Kingdom collapsed. Generally in the United Kingdom, the
   economy went into recession into the second quarter of the year 2008
   and eventually started gaining financial prowess towards the end of the
   year 2009. This forced the United Kingdom government to come up with
   macro-economic policies that would aid the country to survive the
   financial crisis and protect them against future calamities.

   Macroeconomic policies adopted after the global financial crisis

   These macroeconomic policies adopted in the United Kingdom can be
   divided into monetary and fiscal policies. Fiscal policies are the
   strategies adopted by a government that deal with the government’s
   public spending and taxation. Monetary policies deal with interest
   rates and the supply of money in the country.

   Fiscal Policies

              As mentioned above, fiscal policies deal with those policies
   set by the government on taxation, public spending and public spending.
   Looking at some of the fiscal policies, one of the major strategies
   that were enforced was the 2008 bank rescue package. This rescue
   package was initiated to revive the banking sector from significant
   losses that had been incurred. It was comprised of providing money to
   the Bank of England through the Special Liquidity Scheme, providing
   money through the Bank Recapitalization Fund that would help increase
   the banks market capitalization and by providing loan guarantees of up
   to 250 billion pounds.

   Primarily the rescue package was described by 500 billion pounds that
   were injected into the United Kingdom in the form of loans and
   guarantees. This facilitated the purchase of shares for most banks in
   the United Kingdom that would later on add value to them and increase
   their demand. This in exchange would provide capital to huge banks in
   the United Kingdom which they would use to pay up their debts as well
   as have enough funds to support both individuals and businesses. The
   Bank of England provided an additional £200 billion into the money
   markets with the aim of lowering the London Interbank Offered Rate and
   to improve the country’s liquidity position.

   This was evidenced as the Bank of England, through its  Special
   Liquidity Scheme, aided in swapping mortgages that had been considered
   to be risky for treasury bonds with low interest rates This was
   important as it would ensure that the banks’ lenders would still do
   business with the British banks including Abbey, Barclays, HBOS among
   others.

   Another example of the fiscal policies put in place was reducing the
   tax rates so as reduce the financial burden faced by the British
   citizens. This is because with the country being in debt, unemployment
   was increasing and therefore it would be difficult for the citizens to
   sustain their expenditure in relation to taxation. An example of this
   is a 2.5% reduction in the value added tax for a period of up to one
   year. Another example was the 120 GBP tax deductions for all basic tax
   payers in the year 2009. Taxation on land was removed on properties
   that had a value of 175,000 pounds and those below this amount.
   Corporate tax was also reduced in the same year by 2%. This would aid
   in improving the country’s deficit by reducing expenses and increasing
   revenue.

   Monetary Policies

   Monetary policies usually involve using financial or monetary tools to
   influence and determine the interest rates as well as to influence
   aggregate demand, the consumer spending levels in a country, maintain
   inflation at an acceptable level. Additionally, they consider crucial
   macroeconomic elements including the rate of unemployment in a country.

   In the United Kingdom, monetary policies are usually set by the
   Monetary Policy Committee, an independent body that is part of the Bank
   of England. During and after the 2008 financial crisis, various
   monetary policies were pursued in the U.K. to aid in boosting the
   country’s aggregate demand. With the aim of easing up the LIBOR and
   various interest rates in the U.K, the Bank of England through the MPC
   reduced the discount rates by approximately 4.5 basis points within six
   months. This was from a base rate of 5% in late October 2008 to 0.5% in
   March the following year. This monetary policy was put in place with
   the aim of reviving spending by consumers in the United Kingdom as it
   discourages consumers from saving money. With low interest rates,
   consumers would not reap the benefits of saving money and so this
   policy aided in increasing the aggregate demand in the United Kingdom.
   Additionally, it enabled capital to be readily available for
   individuals and consumers at a cheaper rate.

   Another monetary policy that was pursued in the United Kingdom after
   the 2008 financial crisis was significant borrowing from other
   providers of finance. The country borrowed excessively and spent a lot
   of cash with the aim of increasing the money supply in the British
   economy. These funds mainly came from the Bank of England. The Bank of
   England also participate in quantitative easing which was also another
   form of a monetary policy adopted to ease the effects of the financial
   crisis. This is the process of increasing the money supply in an
   economy by actively acquiring assets, securities among other financial
   instruments. Between 2009 and 2012, the United Kingdom created money of
   up to 375 billion pounds that were injected into the country’s economy
   as part of the quantitative easing process. This money was used to buy
   bonds and other securities from financial institutions which would
   reduce their interest rates and make them attractive to citizens.
   People would then borrow more and have more money which they can spend
   and this would eventually help in boosting the country’s economy.

   In terms of the exchange rate, the Bank of England did not interfere as
   such with the determinants of foreign currency in their country. The
   sterling pound during the financial crisis decreased in currency value
   by up to 25%. This aided them to some extent as it increased the
   amounts of goods being exported as they would be cheaper to acquire. On
   the other hand, however, importation of goods would be quite expensive
   for the country.

   Conclusion

   To date, the British economy is still recovering from the effects of
   the financial crisis of 2008. The various macroeconomic policies that
   they adopted have been quite useful in restoring their economy and some
   of them are still in place to be used to aim at boosting the country’s
   economy more and more. The unemployment rate during the financial
   crisis increased to 8.5%. Currently, the unemployment rate stands at
   5.4% showing that the monetary policies in place have been beneficial
   in reducing the unemployment rate in UK. The rate of inflation has gone
   back to what is perceived to be normal in the United Kingdom. This is
   also the same case for the GDP which has improved since the financial
   crisis. However, the government should continually seek to improve
   these policies to prevent the effects of any unprecedented global
   calamity that might affect their economy.
