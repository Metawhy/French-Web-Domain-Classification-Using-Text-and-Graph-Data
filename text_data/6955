   Security Status

   In Softonic we scan all the files hosted on our platform to assess and
   avoid any potential harm for your device. Our team performs checks each
   time a new file is uploaded and periodically reviews files to confirm
   or update their status. This comprehensive process allows us to set a
   status for any downloadable file as follows:
     * Clean
       It’s extremely likely that this software program is clean.
       What does this mean?
       We have scanned the file and URLs associated with this software
       program in more than 50 of the world's leading antivirus services;
       no possible threat has been detected.
     * Warning
       This software program is potentially malicious or may contain
       unwanted bundled software.
       Why is the software program still available?
       Based on our scan system, we have determined that these flags are
       possibly false positives.
       What is a false positive?
       It means a benign program is wrongfully flagged as malicious due to
       an overly broad detection signature or algorithm used in an
       antivirus program.
     * Blocked
       It’s highly probable this software program is malicious or contains
       unwanted bundled software.
       Why is this software program no longer available in our Catalog?
       Based on our scan system, we have determined that these flags are
       likely to be real positives.

   We’d like to highlight that from time to time, we may miss a
   potentially malicious software program. To continue promising you a
   malware-free catalog of programs and apps, our team has integrated a
   Report Software feature in every catalog page that loops your feedback
   back to us.

   Flag any particular issues you may encounter and Softonic will address
   those concerns as soon as possible.

   MyVirtualHome is a 3D home design app that takes its inspiration from
   the visual language of base-building video games. You can use it to

   MyVirtualHome is simple and easy to use particularly if you've ever
   played the kind of lair-building video games that inspired it.

just click on them and a menu will pop up showing you their palette and other
options. Similarly you can move pieces around your design by clicking and
dragging. As with any home design software the main limitation is the
availability of the pieces you want. The app has a reasonably varied list of
features but if something you want isn't included you can also use its menu
to search for examples online and download them into the model. Because this
software is designed for the Australian market technical support can be hard
to reach in UK business hours.

   A useful design tool

Author's review

An easy to use, fully functional home design program.

   MyVirtualHome allows you to easily create your dream home or apartment.
   You can import a plan or create a design from scratch. Choose from
   thousands of real products to place in your design and then walk around
   it in amazing real time 3D.

   MyVirtualHome uses a simple and intuitive menu system that will get you
   started fast. Most people can learn the basics in 10 minutes and are
   creating a full design in less than an hour. The software also features
   an incredibly accurate lighting model that lets you set your lat/long
   and time of year for amazing shadow and real time lighting effects.

       Easy click to place home design program. I have used MyVirtualHome
       since I received a free copy with the Better Homes and Gardens
       magazine many years ago. As a frustrated Architect I have designed
       many a dream home using this product. I have had the occasional
       glitch over the years when it refuses to load but I just download a
       new copy. I would like to see more adjustable components like
       kitchen cupboards, furniture sizes and more decor items but overall
       this is an easy to use program with great graphics.
       Pros:
       One click to make a room, no fiddling around making walls.
       click to place item in rooms.
       3D room view.
       Cons:
       More control when adjusting size of rooms.
       better/more choice for fabrics, wallpaper, kitchen appliances.
       Size adjustable items such as kitchen cabinets, bath, showers and
       furnitureMore
