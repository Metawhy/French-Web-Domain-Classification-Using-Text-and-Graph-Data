Powersheets Goal Action Plans, 2017

   December 31, 2016

   Okay, lovely friends. I’m sharing my action plans, as promised. Please
   keep in mind that I only came to these plans after a TON of work but
   the experience and the process were so valuable! I highly recommend
   this workbook to anyone who is looking to make real change and progress
   towards a meaningful life living their “core values” (as Jess Lively
   would say). If you can’t afford them this year or aren’t sure if they
   will work for you, start with Lara’s blog post series and use this
   walk-through video to help you. I’m making it a priority to purchase
   from Lara to support her continued mission because I wholeheartedly
   believe in the work she is doing (even if I’m not really there in terms
   of the religious aspects). Sometimes, you’ve got to put your dollars
   where your heart is.

   Enough plugging for the Powersheets. Onto the goals.

   For each goal, there is a why, an action plan of starting steps, and
   important checkpoints to help my goals become more concrete. Also, EVEN
   THOUGH THIS IS NOT EXPECTED OR TYPICAL, I felt very strongly that I
   needed the word NOURISH (my #woty ) to start every single goal this
   year. This doesn’t work for everyone, and it probably honestly won’t
   ever work for me again. It’s just WHAT I PERSONALLY NEED right now. Do
   what’s best for you. As Lara always says, there are no rules here – so
   make things work for you!!!

1 | Nourish my physical and mental health {so that I can still be present,
thriving, and making a difference when I’m 80}.

   Ooh, friends, this one was painful. I’m watching my 81 year old
   grandmother slowly deteriorate, and it’s awful because I know that it
   didn’t have to happen like this. It’s the result of several deliberate
   choices.

   I’m terrified of being like that, because I can see some of the seeds
   planted within myself.

   Action Steps
     * Get enough sleep as often as possible. This means 8 hours of actual
       sleep because that’s what my body NEEDS, and usually 8.5 hours
       physically being in bed. This is really, really, REALLY hard for me
       as I’m already extremely pressed for time.
     * Make exercise a part of my daily and weekly routines.
     * Ice skate often, for both physical and mental benefits (this is
       hard to be consistent with because of conflicts between rink times
       and other commitments).
     * Learn to be more comfortable with water, certain foods, and
       balance.
     * Make small, consistent efforts regardless of setbacks.

   Positive Results That I May See
     * Being more healthy for short- and long-term, as well as positive
       self-images

   People to Ask for Help
     * husband, family, find reliable child care for things that don’t fit
       into our schedule, psychiatrist, new PCP

   What Progress Looks Like
     * Continued body progress and less lost time/days

   How I Will Celebrate
     * Enjoy extra time in my daily life from good mental and physical
       health
     * Buy new ice skates (blades and boots) so that I can work on new
       moves that I can’t currently attempt

2 | Nourish my daily quality of life {because it affects me more than
anything else, and small changes could make a big difference}.


   Action Steps
     * Examine and redesign daily routines for both school and non-school
       days (this has been completed as a preliminary design. Working on
       implementation and refinement now).
     * Set limits for certain activities (work, mindless social media) and
       minimums for others (self-care, reading, painting, exercising,
       meditating).
     * Utilize technology for good, not for comparison
     * Give myself GRACE when things don’t go to plan, and don’t use
       setbacks as an excuse to stop trying
     * Keep the little things from piling into big things
     * Don’t fill up extra time gained with striving for perfection or
       overcommitment

   Positive Results That I May See
     * Calm, even when there’s chaos

   People to Ask for Help
     * husband, family

   What Progress Looks Like
     * Daily peace and better ability to handle disasters

   How I Will Celebrate
     * Mental peace and better quality of life

3 | Nourish my family {because they are the most important thing to me by
far}.


   Action Steps
     * Schedule time for myself so I can be the best version of me when
       I’m with them.
     * Be present and proactive, even in simple interactions.
     * Make sure that positive interactions outweigh negative interactions
     * Push out of my comfort zone to do more experiences with them.
     * Snuggle each boy independently at least once a week, giving him my
       full attention.
     * Eat dinner at the table at least 3-4 times per week.

   Positive Results That I May See
     * Better relationships with meaningful memories

   People to Ask for Help
     * Family, mentor that I have in mind

   What Progress Looks Like
     * Less yelling and more connecting

   How I Will Celebrate
     * Ongoing experiences with family
     * Add more opportunities to spend time together (passes to favorite
       places, plan picnics or other fun activities)

4 | Private

5 | Nourish my relationships with friends {so that we will continue to be
supportive of each other and actively involved in each others’ lives}.

   Action Steps
     * Add each close friend to my tending list and make contact once
       every week.
     * Video conference or long phone call once per month
     * Become more active with local friends one/twice per month
     * Help extroverted friends understand my anxiety and reluctance to
       meet in large groups
     * Pick one friend for a care package each month

   Positive Results That I May See
     * Connected and deeper relationships

   People to Ask for Help
     * Friends – schedule contact/times to video chat

   What Progress Looks Like
     * Friends reciprocating contact

   How I Will Celebrate
     * Periodic trips to visit far-away friends

6| Nourish work life and teaching outcomes {so that I maximize impact and
effectiveness but find a much better balance between work and my other
priorities}.


   A.K.A. THE BEAST

   Action Steps
     * Schedule one full 12-16 hour day per month to dedicate to planning
       and creation of materials – NO grading. NO parent contact. NO
       updating Schoology. Use personal days or sick days (preventative
       mental health days) if there are no built-in days off in a month.
       THESE ARE SCHEDULED THROUGH APRIL 2018 in my planner and on our
       family calendar.
     * Complete all tasks by 4:30pm each day and LEAVE, or they don’t get
       done. No more than one hour of work after 7pm each night at home.
     * Spend no more than 3 hours on the weekends on work.
     * Focus on quality target language use by both teacher and students.
     * Re-evaluate curriculum and methods during the summer. Develop
       steady, routine summer work schedule with a daily work overview.
     * Focus on patience, relationships, and quality.

   Positive Results That I May See
     * Less stress, longevity in the classroom

   People to Ask for Help
     * Shannon, Toni, blogs

   What Progress Looks Like
     * Ability to complete routines in the time allotted, increase in
       student performance and happiness

   How I Will Celebrate
     * Savings towards a family summer trip abroad

7 | Private

8 | Nourish mindfulness and spirituality {because outer calm starts with
inner calm}.


   Action Steps
     * Develop a true meditation habit, with proper form and effort.
     * Use Grid Journal daily, and change grids as needed.
     * Push past discomfort with meditation and God to develop comfort.
     * Actively seek God, even it it’s not in the traditional sense or in
       a way my parents understand.
     * DO THE WORK.
     * Wallow in being uncomfortable and asking the hard questions so that
       growth comes from the struggle.

   Positive Results That I May See
     * Feelings of control and being settled/grounded

   People to Ask for Help
     * MYSELF – I have to make myself do the work

   What Progress Looks Like
     * Patience, calm, better handle on anxiety

   How I Will Celebrate
     * Bubble baths!

9 | Nourish simplicity by sprouting through the dirt {because nothing ever
grew without the tremendous effort of pushing the dirt out of the way}.


   This goal is based on Lara’s constant references to gardening, and
   specifically to, “let the dirt be dirt.”

   Action Steps
     * Change “sorrys” into “thank yous” (EX: I’m sorry I was late > Thank
       you for being patient with me as I needed extra time) to change the
       way I express gratitude in relationships
     * Look for the growth in every challenge
     * Say something to validate my self-worth every day
     * Declutter and organize, physically and mentally
     * Change the way I approach social media (develop  a plan)
     * Make no more commitments unless it complements all of my goals

   Positive Results That I May See
     * Overcoming anxiety and guilt

   People to Ask for Help
     * Cultivate What Matters

   What Progress Looks Like
     * LESS of so many things (in a very positive way)

   How I Will Celebrate
     * LOVING myself (and taking a nap!)

10 | Nourish the desire to burn steadily with passion {because going deeper
and being balanced will keep me from burning out}.


   Action Steps
     * Limit and focus my passions. “You can do anything, but not
       everything.”
     * Be the best teacher I can be RIGHT NOW, not the best teacher
       ever/period.
     * Long term > short term – examine all choices
     * Learn to live in the discomfort of new experiences
     * Hang up my new favorite quotes in my classroom, work space at home
     * Cultivate my French-speaking skills

My Once-a-Year Post

   December 30, 2016

   Hahaha. I’m laughing quite a bit at the thought that YET AGAIN I have
   done nothing with this blog for a long, long time and I’m just coming
   here to publicly post my goals. And you know what? I’m okay with that.
   I need things off my plate, and this is one of the things. It doesn’t
   bother me as much now as it did in the past, and I’m happy to just let
   it sit and collect stats from previous posts for a few years until I
   have more clarity and time.

   First, a reflection on the terrible horrible awful that was 2016.

   Last year was the first time I used Lara Casey’s Powersheets to guide
   my goal setting by following along with her posts and watching her
   periscope videos. It was definitely a turning point in my goal setting
   experiences and achievements. I wish I had been able to purchase the
   actual Powersheets because I feel like the 3 month refreshes and other
   built-in features would’ve helped me refine throughout the year and
   better deal with changes/complications. (In fact, this year I’m
   contemplating getting two sets of 6 month undated sheets so I can do
   the prep work — the hard stuff — twice when I naturally pause and
   reflect for the year) Overall, I felt like I was moderately successful
   with some of my goals – starting to build my curriculum, beginning to
   reduce clutter, keeping up regular workouts for a good portion of the
   year, starting to learn how to meditate (but moreso learning several
   ways to cope with anxiety and depression), finding some parts of my
   spiritual path and defining what faith means to me, and having some
   routines  – these are all progress on the public goals that I shared.
   It was the first time that I REALLY felt connected to my goals, and I
   was able to keep that fire burning for longer than I ever have
   previously, as well as rekindle it at different points of the year.

   This year has been a much different experience. Deeper. Richer. WAY
   more difficult. I realized when coming back through my goals that they
   were starting to feel somewhat profound, but most of them were not
   digging to the root causes of what I want and need in my life. This was
   especially evident when my anxiety and depression took a large turn for
   the worse in the spring, and I had a very difficult time recovering. I
   ended up finally seeking professional help from a psychiatrist which
   has forever changed me for the better, even when I still have issues
   (turns out that, for me personally, most of my issues are actually
   chemical and I’m mostly doing a pretty daggone good job of dealing with
   all the crazy stressors in my life – that’s why EVERYONE should see a
   psychiatrist once or twice a year for a checkup, just like they see
   their Primary Care Physician!). My goals had to be turned upside down
   at that point because my ongoing treatment had to come first. And let
   me tell you what an absolute RELIEF that has been! I’ve not been
   without relapses, even with both therapy and chemical treatments, but
   my life is so much better and I get to experience so much MORE of it
   everyday thanks to this huge, scary leap that I finally took. My word
   of the year PATIENCE was a lot more valuable that I had expected it to
   be when I reluctantly gave into it because of how much it was weighing
   on my heart. Patience was a fantastic word for me.

   The prep work this year was incredibly painful and hard. It’s not easy
   to be truthful, in actual written words, and then stare those words in
   the face, and then think and reflect on them. Like last year, I tore
   through the initial portion quickly, but this year I just sat and let
   them sink in – faire mijoter or let steep, if you will – until I could
   add more depth and honesty. I knew I was getting in my own way. I knew
   that I needed to dig deeper to create profound change.

   I have spent several days on my Powersheets this year, and, very much
   unlike me when it comes to self-reflection, I’ve lamented it. My
   process has almost been a grieving process, filled with tears, anxiety,
   and finally, acceptance. I wanted an action word this year that really
   dug to the core of what I was trying to accomplish, and while there
   were several words/phrases that stuck out well, NOURISH ended up being
   my choice because not only does it imply serious action, but
   life-giving, life-saving, replenishing, JUST WHAT I NEED action. It’s
   not going to be easy for me. I already feel guilty about the amount of
   time I’ve wasted, especially in the past year, trying to deal with my
   health and implement self-care routines, a lot of times at the expense
   of my husband or family or work. I’m going to have to cut out some
   things. I’m going to continue my struggle with perfectionism and
   control (something that PATIENCE helped greatly last year). I’m not
   going to add any commitments into my life that don’t already exist
   (even if I know I can help, and would be able to do great things to
   help someone, I CAN’T SAVE THE ENTIRE WORLD so I really should stop
   trying and spreading myself so thin) so that the ones I have can be
   stronger, deeper, and more balanced. I’m not committing to sharing my
   Tending Lists each month because I will play everything by ear but I
   will share my plan for January, and of course, all of my goals and
   posts will be edited to keep some things private because as much as I
   am a total oversharer (impulsive ADHD  – anyone? anyone? haha), some
   things really should remain private.

   After this ridiculously long narrative, I’m going to be a tease and put
   my actual goal action plans in another post, and set it to publish
   tomorrow. My goals are done and my Tending List has been set for
   January, so I’ll edit them into the next post. How is your goal setting
   coming along? I know I don’t have many readers, but there are few
   faithful friends who check in every once in awhile, and I appreciate
   your feedback and comments!

2016 Goals (and an update)

   December 29, 2015

   goals 2016

   First, a quick note: I haven’t yet posted part 3 of the Feeding My
   Family series because I haven’t done a normal grocery shop since being
   on winter break! I promise that it will come shortly 🙂

   It’s crazy hard to believe, but this will actually be my 6th or 7th
   annual posting of goals over the years here at TBP. I’ve done
   resolutions, Day Zero Projects, and anti-resolutions, but this year,
   I’ve decided to stick with goals as my term for the year because
   resolutions just don’t stick. It’s pretty normal for me to goal set at
   three different points in the year: the beginning of summer break, the
   beginning of the school year, and during winter break. I wouldn’t call
   them goals as much as course corrections and the product of a
   reflective life. I’ve also expanded my goals to include a “why” and
   steps to take to help achieve each goal, all thanks to reading up on
   Lara Casey’s Powersheets (I didn’t get to snag any before they sold
   out, but I really need to get my hands on these!). So here are my
   resolutions for the year, barring a couple of personal ones that I will
   keep just for myself.
     * Increase TPT paychecks by at least $500 per month.
          + To increase financial security
               o Make at least 10 new items per month
               o Add variations of popular products
               o Pay for upgrade to premium membership
     * Build French curriculum
          + Make job less time-consuming and more effective teaching
               o Build integral routines
               o Making lasting, effective plans
     * Significantly declutter house
          + Less anxiety and housekeeping burden – easiest achievable
            goal!
               o Start with basement
               o Go room by room
     * Regular workouts – running, ice skating, etc.
          + Long-term health and energy
               o Use what I have already
               o Little, consistent steps
               o Ice skating lessons begin end of February
     * Regular meditations
          + Purpose-finding and anxiety reduction
               o Find meditation guides to help start me on the right path
               o Write down what works to keep things going
               o Note any on-the-spot stress relievers
     * A LOT more water and less caffeine
          + My caffeine addiction is nearly insatiable and no longer
            helping
               o Increase water intake by at least 8 oz daily per week
                 until at a normal amount (decrease caffeine intake by
                 same amount)
     * More regular prayers and relationship with God
          + Spiritual health and longevity
               o Explore scientific-based Christian community (e.g.
                 Biologos, theistic evolution, etc.)
               o Try to pray daily for others
               o Read more scripture
     * Waste less time on phone with meaningless stuff
          + Need healthier forms of escape and winding down
               o Limit to 10 minutes social media and 10 minutes gaming
                 per day unless actually making a true connection (not
                 just scrolling aimlessly)
     * Form better routines
          + Ward off anxiety and be more purposeful
               o Create morning and evening routines and STICK TO THEM –
                 21 days in a row to make new habits
               o Make rewards for attaining goals

   I hope that seeing my goals helps you in making your own! Leave them in
   the comments below 🙂

Feeding My Family: Part 2 – Shopping

   December 5, 2015

   feeding my family series copy

   This post is part of a series on how I plan, shop, and prep food for my
   family. I explain my processes so that you can adapt some of the
   strategies to your individual situations.

   Okay, so you’ve meal planned and you are ready to join me for part two.
   Great! Grab a notebook and come back; I’ll wait.

   *whistling and listening to elevator music*

   One of the best ways to speed up your shopping and save money is to
   know your grocery store. If you start out writing your list grouped the
   way your store is set up, you can get through faster and avoid picking
   up those random items as you hunt for the things you’ve missed. I don’t
   go down aisles where I don’t need an item, and that helps a lot with
   splurges. If you aren’t sure, ask for a store map when you go to the
   store the next time. Chances are, they probably have one at the service
   desk.

   Regardless of your store’s layout, you should move from dry good to
   frozen food to make sure . Here’s the order I suggest:
     * If you are fortunate enough to have a coffee shop in your store,
       stop there first. I treat myself to a Venti Mocha so that I’m not
       hungry while shopping and so that I don’t get tired and shove
       random stuff in my cart. I don’t even have to touch my grocery
       budget thanks to my monthly Teachers Pay Teachers earnings.
     * Pharmacy, Health, and Beauty Care
     * Baby Items (if needed)
     * Cleaning Products and Kitchen Items (paper towels, toilet paper,
       ziploc bags, detergent, etc.)
     * Pet Items
     * Dry Food Items – these are almost always grouped together in the
       middle of the store. If you STICK TO YOUR LIST, you will end up
       doing less damage to your time and wallet here!
     * Bakery/Produce/Deli/Cheese Counter
     * Fish Monger/Butcher/Meat Case
     * Dairy
     * Frozen

   This is my store layout (roughly) with my pathway. Yes, I circle the
   store twice. I need the exercise, and it’s actually much quicker than
   wandering every aisle. You can click on the image to view it larger. I
   labeled things as I would visit them. And, yes, my Kroger is AMAZING
   and huge, and I absolutely adore the market-style experiences (and NO,
   they aren’t paying me to say that, haha).

   Kroger Marketplace Map copy

   Now that you have your store order down, separate your page into three
   columns and leave space for groups of items. In the first column, group
   items in aisles 1-11 and 12-19. In the second column, make groups for
   20, 21-22, 23-24. In the third column, make groups for 25-26, 27, and
   28. I’ve thought about making a cute sheet for this, but each column
   changes sizes based on what I need that trip, so I just use a regular
   piece of paper. Here’s an old list from my most recent trip. Sorry for
   the chicken scratch – I had a kid in the shopping cart so I didn’t have
   anywhere to set my list.

   old shopping list (2)

   What are all of those notations? I write the price (rounded up to the
   next dollar, even if it’s $1.01) so I have a rough price and plenty of
   wiggle room for tax. Please excuse my idiocy in adding them all up – I
   transposed 21 instead of 69 from the second column when trying to
   corral the cart and the kids. The tally marks next to items are when I
   need multiple quantities – for example, I purchased 5 pounds of ground
   beef. I didn’t write it on the list, but I purchased 3 pounds of bacon
   instead of 2. You can see I had a couple of extra items that I had
   forgotten – containers for lunches, pot roast sauce, and breakfast
   waffles. My most expensive category is nearly always dry goods, since I
   have one kid in diapers and another in overnights. Meat is also high,
   but usually not quite this high (I splurged a little for the farmer’s
   bacon, cubed ham, ground sausage, and pot roast).

   How did I get this list from my meal plan? I looked at each of my meal
   plan items individually, then began adding them to the columns. I left
   off what I knew I had in the cabinets (and scratched off a few things I
   had forgotten about already having when I double checked before leaving
   the house). Here’s what I thought through with each meal:

   Hamburgers – buns, ground beef, [DEL: cheese :DEL] , lettuce, tomatoes,
   [DEL: mayo
   :DEL] Vegetable Soup – ground beef, [DEL: stock :DEL] , 2 cans green
   beans, carrots, [DEL: corn, tomatoes, peas, black beans, onion salt,
   soy sauce, :DEL] chopped onion, parsley
   Chicken Fajitas – chicken, fajita seasoning, [DEL: sugar, :DEL]
   tortilla shells, queso, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream
   Chicken Alfredo – chicken, [DEL: Italian seasoning, onion salt, butter,
   :DEL] garlic, sundried tomatoes, heavy whipping cream, parmesan cheese,
   milk
   Crock Pot Roast – roast, carrots, onions, potatoes, McCormick’s Beef
   Stew Liquid Seasoning (2)
   Meatloaf – ground beef, onion soup mix, [DEL: stuffing, eggs, ketchup

   At this point, I try to add other things I know we will need, and do a
   quick inventory through the house in case we are running low on
   toothpaste or toilet paper and didn’t realize.

   Is this involved? Yes, the first few times I did it, it was. It’s
   become so normal to me, though, and I know nearly every recipe
   off-hand, so I can rattle the ingredients off. It really only takes
   about 20 minutes from start to finish to meal plan and make my list.

   Finally, I log onto my Kroger app and go through my paper coupons to
   pull out what I will need so I don’t have to mess with it at the store.
   I do not calculate coupons into my prices – I’d rather be pleasantly
   surprised when I check out.

   Looking at the list above, I had $256 listed for my $250 budget. I knew
   I had at least enough coupons to be at budget, so I didn’t worry. The
   grand total? $235.21 – comfortably under budget. Considering the huge
   expensive of dry good items during this shop and the fact that this
   will feed my family for two weeks with really good meals in big enough
   portions to eat leftovers for lunches, this is actually really great
   for a family of four! That breaks down to roughly $120 a week to feed
   and care for our family — pretty awesome. We’ve cut it down to much,
   much less when we’ve been on tighter budgets. I also stock up when I
   have a little bit of extra budget and see a sale on things we use that
   can go in the pantry or freezer — for example, I spent $4 getting two
   loaves of take-and-bake fancy bread so we can throw it in the oven to
   go with our meals any night without worrying about it going bad. I will
   do a big pantry shop once every 4 months or so if we have a little
   extra cash.

   It’s taken me awhile to develop this method, but each time I use it, I
   get faster at the process and I find that grocery shopping stresses me
   out less and less.

   Our next post will be on prepping – what do you do with all this food
   that you just bought in bulk??? Click on over to see it soon!

Feeding My Family: Part 1 – Menu Planning

   December 5, 2015

   feeding my family series copy

   This post is part of a series on how I plan, shop, and prep food for my
   family. I explain my processes so that you can adapt some of the
   strategies to your individual situations.

   Even for someone who *loves* food and cooking, everyday food planning
   and prep is tedious. However, I’ve found some ways to make things run
   more smoothly overall. It does require some up-front work, but you’ll
   earn it back in one night not spent wondering what to make for dinner
   and searching your cabinets. Multiply that by 5 nights a week, and
   you’ll have an hour back every week.

     What kind of grocery shopper are you? Do you:
     a) just throw a bunch of stuff in your cart and hope that you end up
     with something edible?
     b) go to the grocery for dinner food nearly every night?
     c) buy the normal stuff every week, but get sick of eating the same
     three things?

   For me, I make a big shopping trip once every two weeks, with a quick
   stop at the beginning of the second week if we need more
   milk/bread/produce. It’s so much less stressful not to have to worry
   about what we are eating or how to squeeze in shopping every night (let
   alone the savings!).

   We’ve been meal planning for a few months now, and when we fall out of
   routine, we instantly regret it — life gets more hectic (and much more
   expensive). So here’s how I do it.

   I start by picking a meal for each theme day while looking at my
   calendar, sticking mostly to the days but switching things around if we
   have a crazy night or something else. We mostly adhere to the schedule,
   but sometimes something just doesn’t sound great, so we will swap days
   around.

   We were really worried about meal planning being boring or tedious, but
   it actually helps us keep more variety in our dinners. How? When
   planning a month at a time, we try to plan something different for each
   of the theme nights with as few repeats as possible (unless we are just
   really into a certain dish at the moment).

   Let’s look at the next two weeks (I didn’t plan a whole month this time
   because of the holidays making our schedules weird):

   (Like the colors to match my Emily Ley Simplified Planner?)

   There are some abnormalities to this two-week plan, but overall, it
   shows how different our meals are night-to-night. Note – we usually eat
   fish at least once a week, but I’ve gotten a bit burned out on it
   lately. Also, we don’t mind eating the same meat two nights in a row as
   long as it is prepared in a different way, either.

   The other portion of meal planning for us is lunches. My husband and I
   eat leftovers or lunch meat for our lunches every day, and since I
   usually make a big pot of soup on Sundays, that fills in any gaps. My
   kids, however, have to have specific portions of things for lunches due
   to government regulations, so we’ve developed a series of items:
     * Whole Grain/Protein: Turkey and Cheese or Peanut Butter and
       Jelly on Honey Whole Wheat Bread
     * Fruits: Two fruits each day per week – this week, it’s raspberries
       and clementines.
     * Veggies: Baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers for little boy
       and black olives for big boy

   Ready to start meal planning? You don’t have to do theme nights! This
   is just how we ensure that we don’t eat the same five things every
   week. You could also just make a list of all of your favorite meals to
   look at each week, or modify my nights to suit your family’s tastes.

   Once you’ve got your meal plan ready, join me for the next post, where
   we plan out your grocery trip and talk about money saving tips.
