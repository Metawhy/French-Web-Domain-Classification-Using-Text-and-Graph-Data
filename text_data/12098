   [Email Validation Service]

Real-Time Email Validation API

   With email validation, you won’t waste your budget on email addresses
   that don’t exist. First 100 validations & 10,000 emails are free every
   month.
   Start Validating Now
   Email Validation Service
   [Comprehensive Email Verification]

Validate Your Emails to Increase Delivery Rates

   Prevent typos and eliminate hard bounces. Get comprehensive email
   verification and a three-step validation check for each email address
   on your list.
   [More Accurate Email Validations]

Validation Based on Billions of Sent Emails

   RFC states the formal rules for email addresses. However, in the real
   world ESPs accept addresses that are not RFC-valid, and reject
   addresses that are.

   When we built our validator, we did so based on real-world data + RFC
   spec to ensure more accurate validation.
   Bulk Email Validations
   [Custom Grammar Checks]

Custom Mailbox Provider Grammar

   All major mailbox providers have their own custom grammar rules that
   impact whether an email address is valid in the real world.

   We’ve integrated custom grammar checks for Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo
   into our email validator and are always adding more custom grammar
   checks as we discover these rules.
     * 1
    m+mailgun@gmail.com Doesn’t meet Gmail’s local parts rules.
       m+mailgun@gmail.com doesn’t meet Gmail’s local parts rules.
     * 2
    michael….is….awesome18@gmail.com Meets local parts rules because dots
       are ignored.
       michael….is….awesome18@gmail.com meets local parts rules because
       dots are ignored.

   Email Form Validations
   [Protect Your List From Typos]

“Did you mean yahoo.com?”

   People make typos all the time. Yahoo.com can easily become yaho.com
   and when it does, you can miss out on connecting with that customer.

   That’s why we built in a suggestion service into our email validation
   service. When we have a suggestion for a common typos, we’ll return it
   along with invalid status, so you can offer the suggestion to your
   user.
   [Avoid high-risk recipients]

Avoid High Risk Addresses

   Our email validation API is your first line of defense against
   high-risk recipients. When validating an email address, we check for
   role-based addresses or disposable email domains.
   Protect yourself with email validations
   [AND THAT'S NOT ALL]

Other Great Features of Mailgun Validation

     * DNS lookups
     * MX and A-record look ups
