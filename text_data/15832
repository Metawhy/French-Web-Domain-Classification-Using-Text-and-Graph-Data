Back to School: Teaching is a Work of Heart

   [workofheart.001.jpeg]
   So, it's back to school season.  And I remember writing a post a few
   years ago about setting up my classroom, and I was secretly so proud of
   myself for having matching caddies and baskets for each table color.  I
   was impressed that I copied another colleague and used clothespins to
   hang up student work to save myself time when I need to change their
   work.  I even printed out my own signs.  On white cardstock.  I felt so
   cool with my classroom set up skills I was practically high-fiving
   myself creating the blog post.
   Fast forward to 2017, and things have changed in the classroom set up
   department.  With the explosion of Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest,
   teachers are taking this classroom set up thing to a whole new level.
   I mean, I think Chip and Joanna Gaines should be inviting some of these
   talented educators onto their show to help them out with fixing up some
   houses.  I'm simply amazed and inspired by all you teachers out there
   who are decorating and color-coordinating champs.  I'm pinning your
   ideas, drooling over your pictures on Instagram, and following you on
   Facebook and Teachers Pay Teachers.  I know I am a better teacher
   because of you.
   However...

Teacher Appreciation, Inspiration, and Motivation

   In honor of Teacher Appreciation Day 2017, I've collected some great
   quotes to keep us teachers inspired and motivated to persevere through
   this profession's challenges and society's misconceptions of us.
   [IMG_20170501_213626_289.jpg]
   Alexander the Great basically says his greatness comes from his
   teacher, Aristotle!
   Truly, I can't even count the number of facets of my life that have
   been impacted by teachers!  And it is my humble prayer that I do the
   same for today's youth.
   [IMG_20170502_224305_780.jpg]
   These educators who teach with their hearts not only make us smarter
   but they make us better people.
   [IMG_20170503_222349_834.jpg]
   Teachers, let's ignite that fire that makes our students lifelong
   learners and overall happy, successful people.  Finally...
   [IMG_20170504_231553_583.jpg]
   This is super important to me: as educators, if we don't motivate and
   support each other, then NOBODY else will.  As challenging and draining
   this profession is our lives, I hope that we can find a flicker of
   positivity with our inspiring colleagues.
   Thanks, teachers, for all that you do, have done, and will do.

Re-telling and Summarizing: Strategies and Interventions

   So, how are your interventions going?  Are your students making
   progress in the area of re-telling and summarizing?
   As teachers of reading, we all know that if a student cannot re-tell
   the story, he/she will have difficulty making deeper inferences,
   answering questions about the text, connecting with the characters,
   and, most importantly, enjoying the story. And re-telling, along with
   summarizing, is a skill that can be honed beginning in kindergarten all
   the way to college (think of all those undergraduate and graduate
   students who write abstracts summarizing research).  As an
   interventionist teacher supporting second and third grade students in
   the area of reading, I am constantly grappling with how to best support
   my little friends with their re-tell and/or summary {fiction
   texts...nonfiction texts need their own blog post!}.  After reading a
   book during guided reading, I would pull out a graphic organizer, and
   think to myself, "this doesn't really match the story structure," or
   "this doesn't allow the student to include the most important
   details."  So I began to look at the results of my assessments more
   carefully, searched some of the professional literature, and began
   differentiating my approaches in order to better break down this
   important component of comprehension.

Quick book review: Extra Yarn

   [20170128_185449-COLLAGE.png]
   Before this winter comes to an end, I would encourage you to try to
   squeeze in Extra Yarn as a read aloud.  I really LOVE this book.  Last
   year, I used it as a way to talk about doing great things for the New
   Year, but this book can be used for so many different lessons.  It is a
   great piece of children's literature as well as work of art.  Simple
   yet amazing.  Let's just go through the checklist...it has it all:
     * A great plot structure {characters, setting, problem, solution}?
       Check.
     * A couple author's lessons, ranging from simple to more
       sophisticated? Check.
     * Characters with defined character traits? Check.
     * Can be read over and over again for new ideas and meanings? Check.
     * Mentor sentences?  Check.
     * Mentor text for writers workshop?  Check.
     * Suspense? Check.
     * Humor? Check.
     * Sweet and sassy? Check.
     * A hint of magic? Check.
     * The beauty of kindness? Check.
     * Multiple opportunities to change your voice during the read aloud?
       Check {a very important reason to pick a read aloud üòç}.

   I can't say enough about this book, but Lane Smith, the illustrator of
   many cool books, called this book "perfect." And I agree with him.

Holiday Greetings & New Year's Wishes...with a freebie!

   I hope everybody is enjoying his/her winter break!  What a blessing it
   is to be able to take some time off to relax, eat, spend time with
   family, sleep, and then eat some more.  Eating is my favorite. ‚ô•
   [IMG_20161225_134654_797.jpg]
   But I also know that so many teachers are already thinking about lesson
   planning for the New Year.  I know I'm already thinking about how to
   create resolutions with my little friends with the support of a good
   read aloud.  Last year I had used Extra Yarn, which is an incredible
   book with an awesome  female lead character.  And the book exemplifies
   how a person can have such a huge impact with a simple act of
   kindness.  But I didn't feel like the students developed strong
   personal goals after hearing that story.
   This year I would like to incorporate more of a growth mindset with
   creating the resolution.  I've already read The Dot, so I'm thinking of
   reading What Do You Do With An Idea? or The Most Magnificent Thing.
   I'm not sure which book to use...but it will eventually come to
   me...and I'll post it here on the blog and on my Facebook page.
